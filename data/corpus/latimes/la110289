STUDY REVEALS PREGNANCY AND DIABETES LINK; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE INCIDENCE OF ONE TYPE OF DIABETES INCREASES WITH SUCCESSIVE 
PREGNANCIES, ACCORDING TO A UC SAN DIEGO STUDY.

<P>
A woman's risk of developing Type II diabetes, also known as adult-onset 
diabetes, increases with each successive pregnancy, according to results of a 
UC San Diego study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The increased risk of developing Type II diabetes and impaired glucose 
tolerance, a condition that leads to diabetes, exists "independent of age, 
obesity and a family history of diabetes," conditions normally used to predict 
who will develop the disease, according to the study's principal author, Donna 
Kritz-Silverstein, an epidemiologist in UCSD's department of community and 
family medicine. 
</P>
<P>
However, the increased risks associated with multiple pregnancies are slight, 
and the study should not be used as the basis for family planning, co-author 
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a medical doctor who is chairman of the department of 
community and family medicine, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly wouldn't do my family planning based on this study," 
Barrett-Connor said. "Rather, we think this study is important because it 
suggests something new about how people may develop diabetes." 
</P>
<P>
The study "could be a significant observation," according to Dr. Orville 
Kolterman, adjunct professor of medicine and director of UC San Diego Medical 
Center's Clinical Diabetes Program. The study suggests that "there's now 
another risk factor for the subsequent development of . . . what is a complex 
disease," said Kolterman, who was not involved in the article published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting observation," said Dr. Roger Lerner, an endocrinologist and 
president-elect of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Diabetes Assn. "We'd 
like to hear more . . . and have it confirmed in other population studies." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers now must seek an understanding of how multiple pregnancies affect 
the "diabetic gene" responsible for Type II diabetes, Lerner said. "The cause 
or gene (responsible for Type II diabetes) is not yet known," Lerner said. 
"That's the real issue, and this (study) may be one way to help uncover that 
underlying factor." 
</P>
<P>
Type II diabetes, also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or 
NIDDM, differs from juvenile diabetes, an inherited medical condition that 
develops in infancy or childhood. Juvenile diabetes, which can lead to serious 
health problems, often must be treated with medication. Adult-onset diabetes, 
however, usually is treated by adjusting a patient's diet and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Data used in the study was gathered from 1,186 women observed between 1984 and 
1987. Those women are part of Barrett-Connor's long-range study of more than 
6,000 residents of Rancho Bernardo. That study, which began in 1972, is funded 
by the National Institutes of Health. It is designed to identify risk factors 
for some common disorders associated with aging. 
</P>
<P>
The study dealt with women from the ages of 40 to 92 who were not previously 
diagnosed as having Type II diabetes. The women did not have family histories 
of diabetes and were "actually leaner" than most women in related medical 
studies, Kritz-Silverstein said.

13 HELD IN HUGE MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DESCRIBE THE ARRESTS AS A MAJOR BLOW TO COLOMBIA'S 
MEDELLIN ORGANIZATION. 
</P>

A Colombian who allegedly led a ring that laundered as much as $70 million in 
drug proceeds and shipped a ton of cocaine to Southern California each month is 
in U.S. custody, while 12 people identified as accomplices are being held in 
Tijuana, Mexican authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Fernando Mejia Pelaez, 50, was arrested at a San Diego area motel last 
Thursday and is charged with 174 counts of making false statements and failure 
to file currency transaction reports, Assistant U.S. Atty. L. J. O'Neale said 
Wednesday. Mejia has been a fugitive since 1986, when he was indicted by a 
federal grand jury in San Diego, along with eight other people, on money 
laundering charges, O'Neale added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mexican Federal Judicial Police, Mejia headed an organization that 
laundered $60 million to $70 million a month. The ring allegedly used three 
Tijuana auto dealerships and two currency exchange houses in Mexico to launder 
money for Colombian drug lords. Mexican officials said the ring also used banks 
in Miami, Tampa, Fla., New York and Panama to launder drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican authorities described the arrests, which they said resulted from a 
joint investigation by U.S. and Mexican police, as a major blow to the Medellin 
drug cartel. Although the Mexicans alleged that the ring was shipping cocaine 
to San Diego and Los Angeles, the U.S. indictment against Mejia does not 
include drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 people arrested in Tijuana include three women and three Colombian men. 
In making the arrests, Mexican authorities also seized 42 cars from the auto 
lots and an undetermined amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mexican federal judicial police issued a written statement that 
police are continuing the investigation and expect to make more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neale said that Mejia, who was a fugitive for three years, had $50,000 in 
cash when he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents. He is being held in San Diego 
without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and has a court appearance 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
"The government requested that he be held without bail because he is a flight 
risk. He is in control of extensive assets outside of the United States," 
O'Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
When arrested, Mejia was carrying a Mexican driver's license with a Tijuana 
address and a Colombian passport, O'Neale said. In addition, Mejia had U.S. 
tourist and business visas that were issued to him in Bogota, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"The application and issuance of the visas to Mr. Mejia are being investigated 
by the State Department," O'Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Guillermina Watson was named in the same indictment with Mejia 
and was convicted in 1987 on 206 counts of currency violations. Watson, who was 
an officer at the now-closed Bank of America branch in Coronado, was sentenced 
to five years in federal prison and is the only person named in the indictment 
who has gone to trial. Watson was engaged in illegal activities without the 
bank's knowledge, O'Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. indictment alleged that Watson and Mejia were involved in a scheme to 
launder $36 million that Watson testified came from a Colombian family which 
inherited a gold mine. Watson, 57, was convicted of using a San Ysidro currency 
exchange and area banks to launder the money in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
When sentencing Watson, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades noted that the charges 
against Watson did not allege that the laundered money came from drug profits. 
Rhoades said there was "a strong aroma but no proof" that the money came from 
drug sales.

UTILITY MERGER BACKERS ACCUSE COUNCIL OF BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council compromised its neutrality in regard to the merger 
of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison when it 
passed a Jan. 17 ordinance committing the city "to opposing (the merger) with 
all vigor and legal recourse," a pro-merger organization claimed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans for the Merger, organized by an energy consultant who lists Edison 
as one of his clients, believes that public hearings such as the one being held 
tonight are a sham, and questions whether the council can justly hold hearings 
on the transfer of SDG&amp;E's utility franchise, said spokesman Larry 
O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell's statements came as San Diegans for the Merger broadened its lawsuit 
against the city for allegedly violating the state's open-meetings law, 
accusing the council of a string of illegal closed-door budget decisions to pay 
for attorneys and consultants to thwart the merger. The organization contends 
that those expenditures, decided over the past year, should have been debated 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern is that the city . . . tried to have it both ways," said 
O'Donnell, whose firm, Senior Policy Associates, is being paid an unspecified 
sum by Edison for public-relations work. The council "has tried to be a 
partisan, stiff opponent of the merger, pulling out every stop it can in 
secret, while publicly affirming that they haven't reached a decision," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused Oct. 12 to grant the organization a temporary 
restraining order barring the city from spending $1.5 million allocated for 
attorneys and consultants in an Aug. 8 private session. San Diegans for the 
Merger, which is seeking a preliminary injunction for the same purpose, 
Wednesday filed amended legal papers alleging many such illegal meetings. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys have maintained that the private sessions are legal under 
exceptions to the Brown Act allowing the council to hold private strategy 
sessions on "pending litigation," which includes the city's participating in 
proceedings before the Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network and 
a foe of the merger, agrees that the city should not reveal through public 
deliberations how it is allocating its expenditures for legal help. To do so 
would give the utilities a strategic advantage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson said Wednesday that the Jan. 17 ordinance 
expressed the council's opposition in the absence of information on how the 
merger would affect San Diego's economy, employment picture and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Without those things being considered, it is necessary that we be opposed to 
the merger until those things are taken into account," Johnson said of the 
ordinance, which allocated $126,625 to hire staff in City Atty. John Witt's 
office. However, he conceded that "it doesn't say it nearly as clearly as it 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said that "the mayor's 
position is that she is extremely concerned about it and, so far, the evidence 
is fairly compelling that there could be some fairly serious impacts on the 
citizens of this region." He said, however, that O'Connor's stance would not 
prevent her from keeping an open mind in the upcoming franchise hearings.

GREENING OF A CITY SOWS DEBATE, CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Read his lips. Bob Bonde wants to make one thing perfectly clear: He's not 
against baseball, picnics, apple pie or all those other very wholesome and 
American things. 
</P>
<P>
But, when it comes to his hometown, Encinitas, he says he has to draw the line 
at Proposition A -- the $25-million park bond measure that city officials will 
present to voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, the 58-year-old retired university administrator has 
questioned whether the city should go into the real estate business, whether it 
should buy 150 acres of privately owned land to develop several new public 
parks and recreational trails, and whether it should create six other 
neighborhood parks at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
City officials claim that Encinitas is parks poor and that the acquisition is 
necessary to bring the coastal community up to par with standards set by the 
National Recreation and Parks Assn. for a city of 53,000 people: at least 3.5 
acres of open parkland for every 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Bonde is against a little green grass amid the sprawl of new 
housing and condominium projects. Anyway, he says, nobody in his right mind 
would vote against giving a playing field to a kid with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonde doesn't like the way the city has run its campaign to educate voters 
on the merits of the issue. For beginners, counting area beaches and lagoons, 
there is much more existing public parkland than the 40 acres the city claims 
there is. 
</P>
<P>
And, if the City Council trimmed some other needless expenditures, there would 
be ample funds to develop several new parks and playing fields without raising 
taxes, he says. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, Bonde and a handful of supporters have formed "Citizens for 
No New Taxes." It's not exactly a modern-day Boston Tea Party, but the group 
wants city officials to keep the promise given when Encinitas incorporated in 
1986: no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Spend, spend, spend. Tax, tax, tax," Bonde said. "They have staff coming out 
of their ears and more new projects than they can count. When is it all going 
to end?" 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem: Nobody seems to be able to explain why the city needs 
all this extra land or how much it actually has now for parks. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the tax measure's supporters include Mayor Anne Omsted and the 
entire City Council, along with more than 2 dozen community groups, Bonde's 
group has become the sole heckler along a parade of public support. 
</P>
<P>
The result: angry phone calls to his house and a growing public impression that 
he's the Grinch who stole picnics. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think parks are like motherhood, that they're for kids and no one 
should ever be against them," Bonde said. "Well, I've caught holy heck from 
people in the community devoted to organized sports. They call me at home. They 
say, 'Do you know what you're doing?' 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts. This is the hardest thing I've ever done, to take a stand on this 
issue. Because the last thing I want to do is hurt the community. But 
politicians have to be responsible and credible in what they say and do." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue stand Nancy Orr and "Friends for Encinitas 
Parks," which have summoned similar energy to present their views on people and 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Orr recently resigned as commissioner of the city's Parks and Recreation 
Committee -- and put her catalogue business on hold -- to give ample time to 
co-chair the privately funded parks group and campaign for the measure, the 
first new-tax issue in the city's three-year history. 
</P>
<P>
As Election Day draws closer, both groups have hit the streets to pass out 
flyers and petitions and call residents at home. And the politicking has gotten 
ugly. Both claim the other is disseminating erroneous information. Both have 
waged personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But both agree on one thing: Too many potential voters are confused and 
uninformed by what has become a sentimental community issue. And time is 
fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
"People need a healthy place to exercise and stretch out," Orr said. "We're a 
culture with lots of free time. And we need these new parks as much as we need 
new roads and police protection. It's a pocketbook issue; people are asking 
what's in it for them. The only way to find out is to become informed." 
</P>
<P>
The time to buy is now, Orr and others say, while the land can still be had at 
1989 prices. In a city that is already 80% developed, to wait only a few years 
would sacrifice a part of the city's future mental health, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Encinitas officials say they are taking a straightforward approach 
to inform voters of the importance of acquiring more neighborhood, community 
and regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wigginton, Encinitas Community Services Director, said the city's 40 acres 
of existing parkland is far too little for the demand by community groups such 
as Little Leagues and others seeking to play tennis and softball, or even toss 
a Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
According to standards set by the National Recreation and Parks Assn., a city 
the size of Encinitas should have 50 public tennis courts. The city has one, 
Wigginton said. 
</P>
<P>
A local Little League was also forced to turn away ballplayers because it 
couldn't find enough fields for games. The shortage came after a local high 
school closed its playing fields to the public use after an increase in student 
enrollment, Wigginton said. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to picnics and baseball games, rocky beaches and lagoons don't 
count as parks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people aren't looking at the big picture," he said of Bonde's group. 
"They're focusing on how much open space we have. We're looking at services. 
Ever try to have a picnic in a lagoon? Or play organized baseball on the 
beach?" 
</P>
<P>
Wigginton said $5 million of the bond will be set aside for development of the 
acquired parklands, projects such as senior centers and community halls. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, Proposition A would provide neighborhood parks within half a mile of 
a home and community parks within 2 miles, as well as a regional park, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the purchase of 50 acres in Olivenhain, 20 acres in Leucadia, 10 
acres next to the Lake Drive Sports Complex, 20 to 40 acres on El Camino Real 
near the San Elijo Lagoon and an unspecified amount of land for a general-use 
trail from the coast through the backcountry of Olivenhain. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also create several smaller parks by developing 17 acres of 
playground area at six elementary schools, creating community meeting room 
space and several acres of playing fields and basketball and handball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Payment for the new parks would come from an annual fee based on the assessed 
value of a taxpayer's home, Wigginton said. The owner of a $100,000 home would 
pay $55 a year more in taxes, while the owner of a $150,000 home would pay $82 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"We could get that money in other ways," Wigginton said. "But we're not going 
to just impose this on people. We want the public to rally around the idea. 
That's why it's on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
But Bonde says he is one citizen who will do no rallying. After 16 years in the 
planning department at California State Polytechnic University at Pomona, he 
says he knows poor planning when he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
Like many citizens, he knew little of the proposed park bond until he was by 
chance asked to participate in a community response session sponsored by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It became crystal clear to me that citizens were being asked to vote on 
something they knew little about," he said. "And that's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Not only would the bond break a promise of no new taxes, he said, but the money 
would be unnecessary if the city cut back on other expenditures -- such as 
hiring a consultant for $35,000 to figure out the best way to approach 
taxpayers on the park bond issue and another $100,000 to carry out that advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I could go on and on with their faulty decisions, their flagrant spending," 
Bonde said. "They haven't hardly made a move without hiring a consultant. They 
need to go back and look at the way they do business before they ask for all 
this money for parks they probably don't need." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to existing parkland, Bonde says, the city is crying wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Besides public beaches and lagoons, there are several school grounds and park 
areas in local subdivisions that are not being counted by the city in its 
40-acre figure. 
</P>
<P>
"The package just isn't being presented in a credible fashion," he said. "In 
the ballot document, they throw this '40 acres of city-owned parks' figure at 
you. But that doesn't tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
"People will look at that and say, 'Gosh, we're a concrete jungle.' And who's 
going to take the time to go through the particular figures to prove them 
wrong? It took me a week to do it." 
</P>
<P>
By Bonde's estimates, the city actually owns or controls 213 acres of open 
parkland -- including beaches but not counting San Elijo Lagoon -- far more 
than the 159 acres recommended by the national parks group for a city of 
53,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bonde says city officials should improve the land they already own -- namely, 
Oakcrest Park and the Encinitas Sanitary District lot at Encinitas Boulevard 
and Vulcan Avenue -- before they ask the public for another handout. 
</P>
<P>
George Wardner, a North County real estate agent and a member of Bonde's group, 
said the city did not play fair when it didn't give his group time to draft a 
rebuttal to the proposed new taxes to be included on the ballot document. 
</P>
<P>
"And so, if you read the document, you'll think there's no opposition to the 
measure," Wardner said. "And there's lots of people who oppose it. And more who 
have serious questions about it. There's a lot of half-truths going around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wardner said, in its own general plan drafted three years ago, the 
city said its agreement for use of playing fields near local schools would 
satisfy its need for parks. 
</P>
<P>
"What's changed?" he asked. "Why are they suddenly singing a different tune 
three years later?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bonde plans to paper the town with educational flyers and a message: 
For once, the city of Encinitas should keep its checkbook in its pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking for caution, that's all," he said. "And we want to make sure we 
get our word out, to balance all the hype with some real facts."

2 PARKS DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in several years, Navy officials have declared two San Diego 
parks off-limits to sailors because of widespread violence and drug peddling. 
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Disciplinary Board banned sailors from frequenting the 
Southeast Athletic Field at 45th Street and Logan Avenue and the parking area 
of South Mission Beach Park, in the 600 block of Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's a little bit like playing Mom and Dad, but on the other hand, in 
good conscience, I have to protect the sailors," said Adm. John W. Adams. 
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, a top-ranking official can declare an area or an 
establishment out of bounds "to help maintain good discipline and an 
appropriate level of good health, morale, safety, morals and welfare" of 
personnel. And an "off-limits" proclamation can refer to "any vehicle, 
conveyance, place, structure, building or area." 
</P>
<P>
For years, local officials have maintained an off-limits list that consisted 
mostly of brothels, massage parlors and stores that trafficked in drug or 
sex-related paraphernalia. The Navy has also imposed restrictions on sailors 
visiting certain areas, such as Tijuana, where petty officers 2nd class and 
below in rank are prohibited from visiting between dusk and dawn. 
</P>
<P>
But an entire area has not been totally banned since the early 1970s, when a 
pier at Imperial Beach was declared off-limits because of drug dealing, said 
Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The bans are enforced by the honor system. But a sailor arrested during a drug 
raid of an off-limits area, for instance, would be charged by police and also 
punished by the Navy for violating an off-limits order. 
</P>
<P>
After compiling tips from local authorities, the Armed Forces Disciplinary 
Board, a group of about 40 Navy lawyers and commanding officers, establishes 
the off-limits list. Six months ago, a commanding officer complained that a 
number of his sailors were being robbed as they traversed the Southeast 
Athletic Field. After studying the area and conferring with city police, the 
board decided to ban the two parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said there's no reason for a sailor to want to go there," Schamp 
said. "There's no good thing to do there."

S.D. CRIME RATE UP; DRUGS, LACK OF JAILS BLAMED; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT: OVERALL CRIME IS UP 8%, BUT SOME KINDS OF SERIOUS CRIME HAVE DECLINED, 
POLICE CHIEF BURGREEN REPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
San Diego's crime rate rose 8% during the first nine months of this year, 
despite significant declines in the number of rapes and murders, Police Chief 
Bob Burgreen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen reported progress in curbing gang-related drive-by shootings but noted 
a sharp increase in the number of citizen reports of drug activity in their 
neighborhoods. He also said that a recently completed department study shows 
that 16% of all suspects arrested for felonies are undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
In a familiar refrain, Burgreen told a San Diego City Council committee that 
his officers continue to be hamstrung by jail crowding that prevents them from 
locking up people arrested on misdemeanors, even those charged with violent 
crimes, before arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said there are now 580,000 outstanding warrants for arrestees who have 
failed to appear in court, about one for every four county residents. He said 
that one misdemeanor suspect recently tore up an arrest citation issued by a 
police officer and spat in the officer's face. The officer wrote another 
ticket, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to go out and police the streets when the people you are 
arresting know full well what you can and cannot do to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, endorsing Burgreen's call for more jail space, said 
that "truly, among the professional criminals in this town, there is the 
understanding that crime pays, and there is going to be no punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said that city officials will request proposals within 30 days from 
private firms willing to build and operate a pre-arraignment detention 
facility, but have not decided how to fund the jail, which will cost an 
estimated $4 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen's quarterly report on crime, delivered to the council's Public 
Services and Safety committee, showed an 11.9% decline in murders during the 
first nine months of 1989 from the same period last year. The number of rapes 
dropped 7%, but robberies rose 13.5% and aggravated assaults increased 9.8% 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 9% increase in automobile theft, Burgreen asserted that creation of 
the department's Auto Theft Strike Unit last November has curbed what once was 
a much greater rate of increase. The unit has made 335 arrests this year. 
</P>
<P>
He said drug-related crime continues to be the city's top law enforcement 
problem and reported that the number of citizen tips of drug activity received 
by the department's narcotics unit rose from 350 in January to 450 in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"We're knocking them off as fast as we can , but they're cropping up faster 
than we can knock them off," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen credited the department's Special Enforcement Division, which targets 
street gangs, for a sizable decrease in gang-related drive-by shootings. There 
were 78 in the first nine months of 1988, but just 49 in the same period this 
year, he said.

JUDGE ORDERS SHERIFF TO GIVE DEFENSE REPORTS ON JAIL RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department was ordered Wednesday to release internal incident 
reports on past jail riots to a group of defense attorneys who are representing 
five black inmates charged with rioting in the county's El Cajon jail. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael Wellington, in issuing the order, said he will 
review the reports and decide how much detail from the reports should be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys requested access to the reports to show that their 
clients are being discriminated against because other inmates have rioted in 
the jails and have not been charged with crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the reports) shows discrimination, it will help us," said Richard Boesen, 
an attorney for defendant Mark Andrews, 21. "I think the judge did what was 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Houts, an attorney for the Sheriff's Department, said "there are number 
of reasons" why charges were not brought in the other incidents, such as 
victims who declined to prosecute and witnesses who changed their stories. 
</P>
<P>
Boesen and the other defendants argued that there were six other riots during 
1988 and this year in the county jails in El Cajon, Vista and the South Bay. 
But they said no charges were ever brought against inmates in those cases, 
indicating that discrimination led to the charges against their five black 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Their clients, all from San Diego, are being prosecuted on felony charges of 
rioting and possessing a deadly weapon in jail in a riot over this year's 
Fourth of July weekend.

HOW DOES THIS NAME SOUND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let foreign money buy some Los Angeles office tower and Angelenos barely blink. 
Let the Japanese buy into Rockefeller Center and New Yorkers, of course, 
squawk. They wouldn't be New Yorkers if they didn't. One typical comment: "We 
seem to be selling the country away." 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference that goes just a bit beyond the Radio City Music Hall and 
the Rockettes. Even in the forest of towers that is Manhattan, Rockefeller 
Center is something special. It consists of 19 buildings covering 22 acres 
between Fifth and Sixth avenues and 48th and 52nd streets. The core of 
Rockefeller Center was opened in the depths of the Great Depression -- to many, 
a promise of American dynamism to come. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece was, and is, the Art Deco 70-story RCA Building, still the 
sixth tallest in New York. For those visitors who for some reason did not 
travel to the top of Empire State, the RCA Building offered a special 
attraction, a splendid view of the Empire State Building. Others know 
Rockefeller Center for its ice skating rink, graced during the holidays by its 
famous Christmas tree. The glamorous shops of Fifth Avenue are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The center also symbolized the massive wealth of the Rockefeller family. But 
times change. The Rockefellers needed a little cash recently to meet trust 
obligations so they sold majority control of the office complex to Mitsubishi 
Estate Co. in an $868-million deal. The Japanese government was said to be 
upset that Mitsubishi contributed to the impression that it was buying up 
America so soon after the Sony deal with Warner Communications. But while many 
New Yorkers complained, Mayor Ed Koch said not to worry: "Radio City Music Hall 
will go on forever." That's not quite true, either. Since General Electric took 
over RCA and its network subsidiary RCA, what used to be the RCA Building is 
now the GE Building. How does Mitsubishi Center strike you?

WATER SUPPLY AND TRASH DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud your recent editorials "Dangerous Decision" (Oct. 5) and "Not the 
Right Spot to Begin With" (Sept. 30). I, too, agree that the expansion of the 
Azusa landfill is a dangerous decision in the wrong spot. In fact, I was 
startled by the State Water Resources Control Board's decision to support the 
expansion of the Azusa Western Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Is the board not aware that Environmental Protection Agency has designated the 
San Gabriel ground-water contamination problem as the worst in the Western 
United States? It has been over 10 years since EPA detected this contamination 
and yet every day the residents of the San Gabriel Valley wonder if their 
drinking water is safe -- and how long it will remain so. Clearly, to build a 
landfill in the area would only contribute to the polluting of this aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
The State Water Resources Control Board members seemed so impressed by the 
presence of William Ruckelshaus (former EPA administrator) that they failed to 
see past the economic interests of his company, Browning-Ferris Industries 
(BFI). May I remind them that BFI is a company interested in making a profit. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel ground-water basin provides 90% of the water supply for 1 
million people. If this aquifer is lost, where will these people obtain their 
water? The Metropolitan Water District is overburdened. Besides, this is an 
impractical and unnecessary alternative. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Environment and Labor Subcommittee of the House Small 
Business Committee, I have come to realize that the ground-water contamination 
problems in the San Gabriel Valley have been brought on by years of neglect, as 
well as by willful actions by responsible parties. We have a duty to stop that 
neglect as well as to find those responsible for the dumping. Preventing the 
expansion of the Azusa landfill would help to stop the neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Like the MWD and the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, I am thoroughly convinced 
that the expansion of the dump poses an unnecessary risk for further 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
I fully anticipate that the watermaster and other interested parties will file 
a petition to allow the court to intercede in this matter. It is vitally 
important to San Gabriel Valley residents that they succeed.

STEEL FABRICATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esther McCoy's article "Los Angeles Case-Study Houses" (Opinion, Oct. 8) 
revived memories by this retired steel fabricator. Houlberg Iron performed 
several such houses, the most notable being Craig Ellwood's "Case Study House 
Number One," on Schuyler Road in Beverly Hills (circa 1952). P.B. Philbrick was 
the general contractor and proclaimed he only used $200 worth of wood on the 
entire structure, and that was the forming material for the concrete floor and 
foundation! 
</P>
<P>
Ellwood was a perfectionist who demanded that all welds be ground smooth, and 
hand-filed mitered corner joints were the rule. This was Houlberg Iron's first 
such project. I also recall examining the drawings of the late A. Ouincy Jones' 
"Below Grade" design (mentioned in McCoy's article) in his offices in West Los 
Angeles and was excited by the sheer simplicity of lightweight steel 
construction carrying the design to clean-cut perfection.

LIMITING LENGTHY CRIMINAL TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column "When Justice Runs Out of Gas" (Op-Ed Page, Oct. 23) contains both 
dangerous thinking and naivete which is surprising from an attorney such as 
Royal Oakes. 
</P>
<P>
Megatrials are anomalies which happen only rarely. However, in a system of 
justice as large as the one in Los Angeles, the overlapping of them will occur 
from time to time. Thus, the Richard Ramirez (Night Stalker) and McMartin 
Pre-school trials took place concurrently. These types of unusual occurrences 
should be viewed as just that and not as a reason to change a system of justice 
which has, generally speaking, worked wonderfully well for 200 years in this 
country and for much longer than that in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Oakes seems to attempt to put the blame for lengthy criminal cases on the 
defense, implying that lengthy voir dire is conducted only by defendants and 
directly stating that the defense uses unscrupulous tactics to lengthen trials. 
He also states that trial courts are so worried about having "perfect" trials 
that every whim of a defense lawyer to delay the trial is indulged. Courts of 
appeal have not and are not reversing convictions for minor errors committed by 
trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason for megatrials is that prosecutors often file every possible 
crime rather than attempting to limit the trial and do a second trial if 
necessary. With the sentencing scheme in California, it is unnecessary to 
charge 50-100 counts of child molestation as a conviction on 15 counts would 
suffice for a prison sentence from which the defendant would never be released. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need to reform a system which has worked wonderfully for 200 years 
merely because two or three unusual cases last a long time.

FAMINE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with deep interest the article "Hoping to Leave the Famine Rut" by 
Michael Hiltzik (Oct. 23). His observations about the importance of encouraging 
self-sufficiency in Ethiopia rather than dependence echoed my feelings after 
seeing the beleaguered country in April of 1988. I visited an eastern province 
called Harrarghe with CARE, the international relief and development 
organization. What I saw there was both harrowing and encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 and 1985 the horrible famine years, CARE was rushing food to 600,000 
men, women and children threatened by starvation in Harrarghe and two other 
regions. Today in Harrarghe, CARE has dismantled all of its food distribution 
centers because most of those who were standing in food lines four years ago 
are now farming. CARE is using the food-for-work approach to support farmers in 
environmental projects that will safeguard their land against the next famine. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 the people of Harrarghe and CARE have planted about 8 million trees, 
filled in hundreds of gullies, terraced miles of hillsides, dug water 
catchments and much more. Workers receive food in exchange for their efforts. 
Their handiwork, by conserving water and topsoil, will help all the local 
residents survive the next drought. 
</P>
<P>
Through programs created after World War II, CARE receives free food 
commodities from the U.S. government. CARE uses that food and private donations 
in such a way that $1 from an American donor creates $11 worth of help 
overseas. Best of all, the help is the kind that, as Hiltzik says, gets the 
poor out of "the famine rut." I thank him for an accurate and ultimately 
hopeful look at hunger in Ethiopia.

QUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William C. George's article on earthquake coverage contains an error that 
should be pointed out to your readership. George states that those who did not 
purchase earthquake insurance " . . . may be out of luck, even if their homes 
burned down because of gas leaking from the tremblor-broken gas mains." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, almost all homeowner policies, while excluding earthquakes, cover 
fire and explosion losses that ensue from such causes as broken gas mains. If 
anyone has a question as to whether damage is covered by their policy, they 
should submit a claim to their agent or company. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the opinion of our critics, the business of insurance is paying 
claims, not denying them.

ABORTION ISSUE IN COMING ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was dismayed reading your article "Pro-Choice Groups Target Pringle, 8 Others 
for Defeat" (Oct. 15). It clearly seems to suggest that, in fact, pro-choice 
politicians will be enjoying more public support than pro-life counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
So many of the facts were misrepresented, it was difficult to ignore. For 
instance, Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session of the Florida Legislature 
in an attempt to enact some restrictions on abortion. This legislation never 
made it out of committee. Indeed, this was a pro-choice win, but not reflective 
of the convictions of the entire Florida Legislature, which would have been a 
more accurate barometer of actual public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Hunter's victory in a run-off election was hailed as a significant 
victory for pro-choices. However, she won by an extremely narrow margin over 
pro-lifer Dick Lyles, who actually made a strong showing as a write-in 
candidate in the final election. Even Ms. Hunter acknowledged that his 
percentage of the vote was impressive for a write-in. 
</P>
<P>
I like to see both sides represented fairly. Facts like over 35,000 people have 
risked arrest to attempt to save unborn babies and that seven out of 10 state 
legislative races have been won by candidates who claim to be in favor of 
protecting the rights of the unborn must be considered as well. C'mon, Times, 
if you're trying to make a point, at least be fair to the other side.

'GENTLEMAN BANDIT' GIVEN 50-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Hal Brame, dubbed by authorities the "gentleman bandit" suspected in 
about 100 bank robberies across the nation, was sentenced to 50 years in prison 
Wednesday by a San Diego federal judge for charges stemming from two October 
1988 holdups in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving called Brame the "quintessential career 
criminal" and said he was a "professional thug" who was "addicted to bank 
robberies." 
</P>
<P>
Brame, 35, pleaded guilty July 20 to two counts of bank robbery and two counts 
of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Brame admitted robbing the Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan branch in 
Tierrasanta of $1,075 on Oct. 5, 1988, and the next day, of robbing the Trust 
Savings Bank in Carlsbad of $21,450. He also admitted using a gun both times, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Both robberies followed the same pattern, Katz said. Dressed in a business suit 
and tie, Brame chatted up an officer at each bank about opening a retirement 
account, then pulled a gun and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
Irving sentenced Brame to 25-year consecutive terms in federal prison for each 
of the two robberies. The judge also sentenced him to five years for each of 
the weapons charges but said those sentences could run concurrently with the 
robbery sentences, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Brame could have been sentenced to a maximum of 60 years. The 50-year sentence 
he received means he will be eligible for parole in 42 1/2 years, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
"This sentence will definitely go a long way toward protecting the public from 
Robert Brame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested Brame in Sacramento on Oct. 28, 1988. Authorities had been 
searching for him since he escaped in 1986 from a North Carolina prison, Katz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During those two years, authorities believe, Brame used the same routine he 
used in the two San Diego-area robberies in about 100 holdups nationwide. 
Called the "gentleman bandit" because of his business suits, Brame preferred 
Ralph Lauren clothes, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Brame still faces prosecution on robbery charges in Northern California, 
Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia and Florida, Katz said. He has been convicted of a 
number of other offenses, including kidnaping, escape and assaulting a police 
officer with a weapon, Katz said.

SATURDAY'S HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are last week's top collegiate football performances by South Bay 
high school graduates: 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Sale, Texas-El Paso, senior: The former Bishop Montgomery linebacker had 
three interceptions, returning one 27 yards for a touchdown, and 14 tackles in 
a 34-31 loss to San Diego State. It was the second-best, single-game 
interception mark in UTEP history. 
</P>
<P>
Faasamala Tagaloa, UC Berkeley, senior: The former Bishop Montgomery wide 
receiver had touchdown catches of six and 30 yards in a 25-14 loss to Oregon 
State. Tagaloa leads the Bears with four TDs this season. 
</P>
<P>
George Malauulu, Arizona, freshman: The former Carson quarterback, making his 
first start for the Wildcats, completed five of seven passes for 110 yards and 
one touchdown, and ran 38 yards for another score in a 38-14 win over Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Errol Sapp, Arizona, freshman: The former Carson running back rushed for 71 
yards on 11 carries in the Wildcats' victory. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Holt, USC, senior: The former Banning fullback gained 45 yards on 14 
carries and scored the Trojans' second touchdown on a five-yard run in a 19-0 
win over Stanford. 
</P>

CLU TO MEET MASTER'S IN SOCCER PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, surprisingly seeded third in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 soccer playoffs, will meet The Master's, 
the second-seeded team, Tuesday in the playoff opener for both schools. The 
game at Master's is scheduled for 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
CLU Coach George Kuntz had speculated that his team might not qualify for the 
playoffs if it lost its season finale to Fresno Pacific, which it did, 1-0. But 
one-goal losses to Westmont and Master's apparently worked to CLU's advantage 
in the Longo System, the formula by which playoff berths are determined. 
</P>
<P>
The Longo system takes into account goals allowed, strength of schedule and 
several other factors. 
</P>
<P>
Master's, 13-4-3 and ranked 13th in the nation, beat Cal Lutheran, 4-3, earlier 
at CLU. The Kingsmen are 11-6-1.

BELL-JEFF WIN DAMPENED BY POSTGAME NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The playoff hopes of the Bell-Jeff High girls' volleyball team revolved around 
two factors Wednesday against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a stroll that middle blocker Nikki Gros took after twisting an 
ankle midway through the second game. Gros hobbled back and recorded 10 kills 
and 10 blocks to lead the Guards to a 15-9, 15-17, 12-15, 15-10, 15-7 San 
Fernando Valley League victory at Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
But the second bit of fortune Gros and her teammates needed failed to 
materialize. Bell-Jeff anxiously awaited news of the score of a match between 
Alemany and Chaminade to determine its playoff hopes -- and the news was not 
good. Chaminade won, giving it sole possession of third place and making the 
Guards' win anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bell-Jeff (5-5 in league play) will miss the playoffs barring a 
wild-card selection, the Guards can at least take satisfaction in coming back 
against Notre Dame after falling behind, two games to one. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disenchanted after our last loss to Chaminade," Bell-Jeff Coach Hal 
Krug said. "And we came back with a purpose tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Guards scored the last five points of the fourth game, two on Gros kills, 
to break a 10-10 tie, then continued their surge in the final game. Celina 
Fueconcillo had five service aces in the fifth game to help put Notre Dame 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, the league's second-place team, was led by Ellen Strong with 15 
kills.

* Say cheese: Former First Lady Nancy Reagan says she's concerned about the 
impression created by the 83 photographs in her book, "My Turn," which do not 
include her stepdaughter, Maureen Reagan, or her brother, Philadelphia 
neurosurgeon Richard Davis. The Reagans' California spokesman, Mark Weinberg, 
said that pictures of both were "slated for the book, but the publisher cut 
them out for space. . . . Mrs. Reagan is upset that those pictures weren't 
included." 
</P>
<P>
* If at first you don't succeed: John F. Kennedy Jr. has failed his first 
attempt to pass the New York state bar examination. The 28-year-old son of the 
slain President was among about 7,000 people who took the test in July. About 
70% passed. A New York University law school graduate, Kennedy works in the 
Manhattan district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
* Reel expert: A Baltimore man so skilled at burglary that he once made 
videotapes on the subject for local police is being tied to more than 1,000 
break-ins in Florida. Richard Makofski, 35, is charged in a fugitive felony 
warrant with dealing in property stolen over the past nine months in Palm 
Beach, Dade and Broward counties. Convicted of burglary in 1985, Makofski is 
being linked to a gang that broke into as many as six apartments a day. 
</P>
<P>
* And the righteous shall flourish: West Germany awarded its highest medal for 
civilians to Mies Giep, 80, a Dutch woman who helped hide Anne Frank from the 
Nazis in an Amsterdam canal house. In London, Queen Elizabeth II made former 
South African lawmaker Helen Suzman, 71, an honorary dame in recognition of her 
lengthy campaign against apartheid.

MAGAZINES: ECOLOGY PROPHET FIGHTS FOR LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For centuries, Americans have treated our precious soil like dirt. A terrific 
cover story in the November Atlantic Monthly warns that we had better clean up 
our act fast. 
</P>
<P>
Around the world, farmers and technologists and biologists are working to stop 
soil erosion and water pollution and to advance the science of sustainable 
agriculture -- a way of farming that doesn't deplete the Earth's scandalously 
overused resources. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Jackson, a geneticist who created the Land Institute in Kansas, is "the 
most radical of America's agricultural prophets," according to Atlantic writer 
Evan Eisenberg. In profiling Jackson, Eisenberg creates an intricate, 
intriguing portrait of the awkward -- some say catastrophic -- way American 
farming methods intersect the natural ecology. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on the damage inflicted on America's topsoil by tilling and 
planting crops each year are staggering: "A third of our farmland topsoil, 
accumulated over millennia, is gone. For every bushel of corn that Iowa grows, 
it sheds at least two bushels of soil." 
</P>
<P>
Because the soil that hasn't washed or blown away is of poorer quality, farmers 
have resorted to chemical fertilizers and pesticides to improve productivity. 
</P>
<P>
But this use of fossil fuels is an inefficient use of energy and just plain 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1948, at the dawn of the chemical age, American farmers used 15 million 
pounds of insecticides and lost 7% of their crops to insects," the article 
states. "Today they use 125 million pounds and lose 13%." 
</P>
<P>
The prairie, on the other hand, with its naturally diverse mixture of plants 
and root systems can defend itself against predators and disease. It is 
superior in other ways, as well, which is why many modern agronomists believe 
that, "Wilderness is the standard against which agriculture should be judged." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has a wild vision of how the two can be combined. As Eisenberg writes, 
"From the point of view of the ecologist, the prairie is doing everything 
right. From the point of view of the hungry ecologist, it has a serious flaw. 
What Jackson has in mind is a prairie that can feed the world." 
</P>
<P>
He and his students and colleagues at the land institute are working on what, 
technically, would be termed a herbaceous seed-bearing perennial polyculture. 
Jackson calls it "a domestic prairie." 
</P>
<P>
While Jackson considers genetic engineering to be the Great Satan, he is 
willing to make some compromises with biotechnology in his quest to achieve a 
more natural way of farming. But he wants to move slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, in this ambling Chautauqua of an article, Eisenberg describes a 
lecture Jackson gave to a group, in which he carefully detailed nine categories 
of ecological trouble that biotechnology might unleash. At the end of the talk, 
Jackson said to the group: "Now look, you people worked very hard to follow me, 
but you couldn't stay with me, could you?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer was no. And that, Jackson told them, was his point precisely. This 
is tough stuff, but stuff that laymen as well as scientists need to understand 
fully. So far, they don't, yet we proceed like a drunken farmer driving a 
tractor at full throttle. "This is a threat to democracy!" Jackson told his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Heroic cleverness" in the way we deal with the natural world has got us into 
many of our present environmental predicaments. Jackson says that it's time for 
people to call for a moratorium on biotechnological brilliance, to pause and 
catch their breath. He knows that's unthinkable in this culture. But still, he 
believes it's imperative that we "Call time out and say, 'Let's think about 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other noteworthy articles in this issue include James Fallows' discussion of 
what we have to learn from Asian nations and an interesting analysis of modern 
suburbia by Nicholas Lemann. 
</P>
<P>
California Issues a Report Card for Judges 
</P>
<P>
Judge not lest ye be judged, the saying goes. But if you pull down a paycheck 
as a professional judge, it only seems fair that you be held up to judgment 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
California magazine put this state's judges before a jury of their 
justice-system peers -- other judges, lawyers, commissioners and cops. Backed 
by evidence gathered from court records and the Commission on Judicial 
Performance, the magazine's reporters found seven judges guilty of wrongs 
ranging from simple arrogance to incompetence and malice. 
</P>
<P>
Catalogued in the November issue, the "insider's brief on the state's wackiest 
court jesters" includes Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Henry Patrick Nelson, 
who allegedly told whispering spectators he would have them shot; Bruce William 
Dodds, an apparently misogynic Santa Barbara County judge; and Ventura County 
Municipal Court Judge John J. Hunter, who sentenced a man to 930 days in jail 
for traffic violations without allowing him time to prove his assertion -- a 
correct one, it turned out -- that the tickets weren't his. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue, California puts the state's water on trial, and finds that 
in many places, including Los Angeles areas served by the Metropolitan Water 
District, traces of aluminum sulfate, put into water to remove particles, may 
be contributing to Alzheimer's disease in the population. Meanwhile, there is 
no state requirement that bottled water be tested for this chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Could Real Estate Be Nodding Off? 
</P>
<P>
The sky may not be falling, but at least a few naysayers claim that 
California's real estate may be on the verge of taking a dive, or at least a 
long nap. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 30 Forbes magazine gives voice to contrarian analysts such as Timothy 
Hurckes, who speculates that by 1991, the market -- especially at the high end, 
especially in certain areas -- will be in for a bit of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
And that may also mean trouble for developers and speculators and the 
institutions that gave them loans. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a price dip goes against the common wisdom of those who believe 
California's diversified economy will continue to support rising real estate 
values. 
</P>
<P>
But those who see a downturn have their reasons, too. Pollution and traffic are 
driving off a lot of folks, they say, and of those who stay, only 16% can 
afford homes at today's prices.

A HOME-BUILDING CASE STUDY;

<P>
DESIGN: THE THREE HOMES BUILT IN THE CASE STUDY PROGRAM IN LA JOLLA IN 1962 
WERE A BEACON OF INNOVATIVE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked on a La Jolla cul de sac are three revolutionary San Diego houses. 
Twenty-seven years after they were built as part of the Case Study Houses 
program, the minimalist wood-and-glass homes known as the Triad Development 
seem like creative anomalies among their conservative Mt. Soledad neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
In photos taken shortly after their completion, the homes stand apart from the 
traditional wood-and-stucco, shingle-roofed bungalows that had been the norm. 
Huge panes of glass bring in views of the ocean and landscaped interior 
courtyards. Flat roofs rest above 10-foot ceilings and doors. 
</P>
<P>
Siting was the key to the development. 
</P>
<P>
The homes are quite different, yet they were once unified by common forms, 
materials and landscaping. The upper two houses, designated as B and C, were 
built as a pair with a shared motor court between them. Their driveway lines up 
with the entry walkway to House A, across the street, giving symmetry to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the later Case Study Houses had steel skeletons, the ones in 
La Jolla mostly used wood post-and-beam frames that make today's homes seem 
unnecessarily complicated. Ceiling beams rest on exterior posts, giving a 
kinetic effect of flying buttresses. 
</P>
<P>
Open floor plans, common today, were thought progressive in the early '60s. 
Rooms flow logically from one to another, linked by broad openings and wide 
halls. State-of-the-art kitchens included walnut cabinets on 10-inch steel 
legs, which made cleaning under them a simple job. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Long Beach architects Killingsworth, Brady &amp; Smith, the three 
houses are San Diego's only legacy from the Los Angeles-based Case Study 
program, the subject of an exhibition of models, drawings, photos, videos and 
reconstructions of two houses on view through Feb. 18 at the Temporary 
Contemporary art museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Arts &amp; Architecture magazine Editor and Publisher John Entenza conceived 
the Case Study plan to develop innovative, affordable housing in the years 
after World War II. Architects selected by Entenza were paired with developers 
willing to take a chance on fresh architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla houses were among 24 Case Study houses completed out of 36 
designed between 1945 and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The architects experimented with affordable materials, such as plywood, 
concrete block, stock sheet glass, aluminum siding and corrugated wire glass. 
They proved that inexpensive construction need not mean mundane architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, technology has eclipsed some of the methods, yet those who 
</P>
<P>
occupy the homes today are pleased with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're comfortable," said Nancy Manno, who lives in House C, which shares a 
motor court on the southern side of Rue de Anne with House B, both across the 
street from House A, the largest of the three. "We'd like a library and a 
little more storage, but people who come to visit don't believe our house is 
less than 2,500 square feet. With the openness and high ceilings, it seems very 
large." 
</P>
<P>
As with any revolutionary designs, these had shortcomings. Joseph Manno, an 
industrial designer, pointed out how, from outside, the sandwich of carpeting 
and carpet pad is at the bottom of the glass walls; there is no molding strip. 
Because most walls are either steel or glass, a new phone line had to be routed 
through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Heating ducts and hot water pipes are contained in the slab. When a pipe broke, 
the Mannos recalled, steamy water spewed from heater vents until a plumber 
crawled "like an Indian" on his hands and knees, ear to the floor, until he 
heard the hissing of the damaged pipe and felt a warm spot on the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The Mannos added track lighting and hidden drapery tracks in the living room. 
To this day, architect Ed Killingsworth dislikes the clutter and harsh shadows 
created by ceiling fixtures. He provides outlets for table lamps. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Tony Amantea had planned to build 82 Case Study Houses, but ran out 
of money before completing the first three. That, according to Killingsworth, 
explains some of their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the homes remain fairly true to their original form. Houses A and C 
received minor interior alterations. A family room was added to House A. From 
the front, though, it looks much as it did in 1962; you still cross a 
reflecting pond on several white, precast concrete stepping stones to reach the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller ponds in front of House C were filled in with landscaping years ago. 
The Mannos talk of restoring them. 
</P>
<P>
House B, a favorite of both Killingsworth and magazine editors because of its 
wonderful interior courtyards, is virtually unrecognizable now. Years ago, the 
courtyards were enclosed to add rooms, and, inexplicably, this modern house 
received a shingled mansard roof. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bevash, the owner of House A, studied architecture at the University of 
Southern California under Case Study architects Gregory Ain and Quincy Jones. 
He is considering doing his own Case Study-type development in San Diego, 
giving young architects a chance to experiment with the design of houses. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why there isn't any innovative architecture among the many thousands of 
production houses built in San Diego each year, almost any builder will tell 
you that's not what people want, that they feel more comfortable with familiar 
forms such as the popular pseudo-Mediterranean style now in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bevash and Killingsworth don't buy that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this feeling that anything will sell in a good neighborhood on a good 
site," Bevash said. "If anything will sell, why not a good design?" 
</P>
<P>
"We got involved in a tract project in Seal Beach years ago and did some atrium 
courtyard houses similar to House B," Killingsworth said. Among several homes 
built, the builders allowed only 10 with flat, Case Study-style roofs. Yet 
these were the first 10 sold, the architect said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, some critics have complained that the Case Study Houses and 
other exercises in modern architecture look interesting on paper, but are too 
stark for everyday living. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work is always warm," argued Killingsworth, whose own home is built in the 
Case Study style. "I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is a less cluttered 
life style."

SOCIETY: CULTURES MIX AT 'MIDNIGHT IN MOSCOW!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CORONADO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet director Roman Viktyuk and set designer Vladimir Boyer went native 
Saturday night and dived -- with knives and forks that flashed as bravely as 
Georgian dancers' swords -- into California culture as represented by salad 
with goat cheese, surf 'n turf and raspberry cream cake. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the cake occasioned a consultation between Viktyuk and his 
interpreter, who explained to Viktyuk that the 350 chorused voices in the Hotel 
del Coronado's Crown Room were climbing the scales in honor of the Moscow 
director's birthday. Viktyuk responded with a quick wave and a tired smile, but 
could be forgiven for looking partied out, since he had spent the previous 
evening at a downtown San Diego nightspot celebrating his natal day in an 
enthusiastic survey of California wines. 
</P>
<P>
Viktyuk and Boyer, in town to help stage the world premiere of Soviet 
playwright Nikolai Kolyada's "Slingshot" playing at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre, shared the spotlight as guests of honor at the Rep's "Midnight in 
Moscow!" gala, which was given as one of the seemingly innumerable ancillary 
events of the city's Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its name, the party actually began at 6 p.m. (or 5 a.m. Moscow time) 
with a VIP reception that gave top-level patrons a chance to schmooze, through 
interpreters, with the visiting Soviets. Viktyuk and Boyer made easy targets 
because, like most visiting Soviets, they wore suits instead of black tie. (The 
light gray pinstripe regularly sported by Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhail 
Gribanov, who did not attend the Rep gala, has already become something of a 
legend). 
</P>
<P>
Not quite everyone required an interpreter. "I've been really practicing that 
Russian," reported Rep managing director Adrian Stewart as he rattled off a 
greeting in what may have been a Moscow accent. "I know how to say 'hello, good 
evening and nice to meet you.' " (Stewart added that he also knows moznah, 
moznah, which he said now echoes through Rep offices and auditoriums. It 
translates as "move it!") 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Hankins and Linnea Arrington shared the duties of mounting "Midnight 
in Moscow!" 
</P>
<P>
"Having 'Slingshot' here is so thrilling that we had to build our gala around 
it," Hankins said. "We have Russians here tonight, but we're also making a lot 
of money, which for any arts organization in this day and age is pretty 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
"Having the Russians here made this event an easy sell," added Arrington, who 
echoed a comment made by other party-givers who have been lucky enough to snare 
a Soviet or two. Anything Soviet is so "in" in fund-raising circles these days, 
in fact, that itinerant Soviets could easily become a growth industry for San 
Diego charities in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Hankins estimated net proceeds of $50,000, a fair portion of which was raised 
by a live auction of such items as a purebred Siberian husky pup (the buyer, 
who paid $750, actually will get the pick of the next litter at the donating 
kennel) and a walk-on role in a November preview performance of the Rep's 
annually staged "A Christmas Carol." That bit of fleeting fame cost its buyer 
$3,250. 
</P>
<P>
One of the blue crystal "Friendship" eggs, commissioned as a commemoration of 
the arts festival by Jessop's Jewelers and created by British artist Carl 
Faberge, ended in the hands of Shelia Davis and hotelier Larry Lawrence. Davis 
was listed as event honorary chair in recognition of her help producing 
"Slingshot," a donation that won her considerable praise from table-mate and 
Rep producing director Sam Woodhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Shelia's contribution is one of the boldest acts of generosity in our history, 
because it allowed us to bring to San Diego an artist (Viktyuk), who I would 
say is a genius," said Woodhouse, who went on to praise his theater's 
production. "This is a work of art like San Diego has never seen. We're not 
doing middle-of-the-road American theater. This is a very Russian, very 
passionate, very international piece of art." 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the gala contented themselves with international art in the form of 
the Wayne Foster Orchestra, which enticed the Soviets to the floor with "La 
Bamba" and "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," and with performances of an 
Uzbekistan drum dance and a traditional Russian shawl dance. The Wayne Foster 
singers, who make a point of moving with the music, stood by and marveled at 
the exotic arabesques of the Soviet dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Dottie Georgens, emigre artist Natasha Doubrovskaya, 
Amy and Bill Barnett, Susan and John Wertz, councilman Bob Filner, Sheri and 
Ben Kelts, Diane Saikhon with Alex Szekely, Maggie and Scott Anderson, Valerie 
Preiss with Harry Cooper, Bud Fischer, Susan Zale with Jack Berkman, Mary 
Swanby, Pat and Charles Beck, and Susan Eddington with Larry Favrot.

SAN DIEGO -- A sextet of Soviets drew several dozen key supporters of the San 
Diego Opera to a genuine midnight supper and cast party after the Oct. 21 
opening of "Boris Godunov." 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Rene Jenkins hosted the intimate soiree in an upstairs room at the San 
Diego Yacht Club and cheered delightedly when title bass Alexander Morozov, 
conductor Jansoug Kakhidze and other cast members burst into song over the 
stuffed eggs, offered from a tray by a strolling server who looked altogether 
enchanted by this response to so ingenuous an hors d'oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
All the other principals, including mezzo-soprano Irina Bogacheva and tenor 
Teimuraz Gugushvili, joined members of the opera's Bravissimo Forte Patrons 
(who donate $5,000 or more per year) for the buffet of chicken hash, roast beef 
and blinchikis, all of it set around a carved ice bear that dripped slowly onto 
a silver platter of crudites. Most cast members paused first to accept the 
glasses of iced vodka and champagne that waited just inside the door. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was jovial, occasionally musical and never quiet. Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor arrived in the company of her sister and brother-in-law, Mavourneen 
O'Connor and Tom Kravis, and provoked nearly operatic peals of laughter when 
she addressed Kakhidze as "Spencer Tracy;" the conductor evidently is very 
proud of his close resemblance to the late actor, and he offered a toast when 
given the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
Opera director Ian Campbell and San Diego Museum of Art assistant director Jane 
Rice huddled by the buffet and reminisced about Thanksgiving 1987, which they 
spent in Moscow with O'Connor and other members of the San Diego delegation 
that negotiated the exhibits and performances for the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We laid the groundwork there," Rice said solemnly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only 15 months from 'go' to 'whoa,' but we put the opera together that 
fast," added Campbell. "That's a very short time period when you're dealing 
with the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were opera President Esther Burnham with Jack Lasher, Lollie 
and Bill Nelson, Lee and Frank Goldberg, Frank Rice, Sally and John Thornton, 
Ann Campbell, Kathryn and James Colachis, Monsignor I. Brent Eagen, Jacque 
Powell and Marion Bateson.

INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>

The Scene: Monday night at Morton's, where Spy magazine threw a highly 
anticipated third anniversary party for the ultra-hip and super-trendy East 
Coast periodical. The evening was co-sponsored by NBC, which will present the 
magazine's coming TV special. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: "Boy, there are a lot of agents here," mumbled at least half a dozen 
guests, slipping outside for some air. Indeed, it looked like a scene from the 
CBS comedy "The Famous Teddy Z," as power-suited studio types swapped business 
cards and made plans to take meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Besides every agent in town, one could spot comedian Harry 
Shearer; writer Merrill Markoe; media critic Eric Burns; political consultant 
Patrick Caddell; actress Mariel Hemingway; "Batman" star Michael Keaton; 
professional gossips the Hollywood Kids; "thirtysomething" star Peter Horton; 
producer Larry Gordon; Spy editor E. Graydon Carter; Spy's elusive Hollywood 
correspondent Celia Brady; "Family Ties" star Justine Bateman with her steady 
boyfriend, Leif Garrett, and NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Fresh shrimp, mini-burgers, drumsticks and potatoes Anna with caviar, 
brought through the crowd on trays by beleaguered waiters who looked like they 
were having a miserable time. 
</P>
<P>
Pastimes: Trying to squeeze through the standing-room-only crowd; trying to get 
a drink; trying to find your agent in the crush. One actress, who refused to be 
quoted by name, left quickly, complaining, "My agent didn't even recognize me 
in there!" 
</P>
<P>
Whoops: Brandon Tartikoff, the ostensible co-host of the party, went virtually 
unnoticed at the door. As he tried to enter, one door woman snapped, "please 
check in sir," before another embarrassed staff person whispered the word to 
let him in. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: If one needed any demonstration that Spy is a hot item in Los 
Angeles, the party proved that there are hundreds of trendy types in town who 
were willing to beg for one of the highly coveted invitations to the event. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Many and unpleasant. The room was overcrowded to the point that 
waiters hoped aloud that the fire marshal would not make an appearance. Guests 
who went out to the patio through an open door just to get some air were 
stopped from coming back in and forced to wait 10 minutes in line all over 
again to re-enter at the front door. Waiters circulated outside to take drink 
orders, but security personnel came around after the waiters to take the drinks 
away and inform guests that they weren't allowed to drink anything outside. 
After this, quite a few guests stomped out and headed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Irony: There were precious few creative, talented people at the party. Instead, 
the turnout was largely composed of the same sort of shiny-suited 
schmoozemeisters that are usually skewered in Spy magazine. KEVIN ALLMAN

A GALA FOR THE STARS OF THE ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John W. Kluge, last month named the wealthiest man in the United States by 
Forbes magazine, surveyed the Arcadia ballroom of Loew's Santa Monica Beach 
hotel, where 700 current and former Ice Capades performers, crew, creative 
staff and executives had gathered for the venerable ice show's 50th anniversary 
gala reunion on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
They were almost all there, hundreds of past and present stars of the ice. 
Missing was Peggy Fleming, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist in women's figure 
skating, who sent her regrets after the Northern California earthquake. Robin 
Cousins, the 1980 Olympic men's figure skating champion, told the crowd he'd 
talked with Fleming and she said, "I'd love to be there, but my house is in 
eight different parts of San Jose right now." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, chairman of Metromedia Co., owned Ice Capades for 23 years, selling the 
show in 1986 to Thomas K. Scallen, while remaining a partner. He and Metromedia 
executive vice president Stuart Subotnick flew in from Charlottesville for the 
evening, joining celebrants from throughout the United States and Canada as 
well as Europe, Australia and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold the show but we never left the people," Kluge said. "They are what Ice 
Capades is all about -- it's the huge family." 
</P>
<P>
The "family" reunion began with a cocktail party Saturday evening at Pomodoro, 
continued Sunday with attendance of an Ice Capades performance at the Forum 
starring 1988 Olympic women's figure skating silver medalist Elizabeth Manley 
and pair-skating silver medalists Natalie and Wayne Seybold, and culminated 
with the post-show bash at Loew's. 
</P>
<P>
At cocktail time at the hotel's atrium lobby, Cousins marveled, "I just met the 
man who's the reason I skate. I saw Nicky Powers playing the prince in a 
production of 'Sleeping Beauty' on ice in 1967 and said 'I love skating, I have 
to skate.' " 
</P>
<P>
The musings and recollections continued over dinner: warm salmon mousse in 
lobster sauce, salad, sauteed breast of chicken with morels in mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Olympic champion in men's figure skating, Scott Hamilton, and silver 
medalist Peter Carruthers reminisced about the winter games. Ken Shelley, 1972 
U.S. champion and Olympic contender in men's and pair skating, told former 
chorus skater Linda Illsley Simons about the all-star skating AIDS benefit to 
be held Monday at New York City's 26th Street Armory. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and Cousins emceed the program. Besides Kluge, speakers included 
Scallen and George and Denise Eby -- he a former Ice Capades chairman and she a 
member of the first company. Receiving cheers and applause were such former 
favorites as Donna Atwood, Bobby Specht, Bob Paul and Barbara Wagner, Sonya 
Dunfield, Norah and Michael Kirby, Robin Lee, Aja Zanova, and Tim Wood; ice 
clowns Freddie Trenkler and Terry Head; and the oldest attendee, 92-year-old 
Irma Thomas, an early Ice Capades star. 
</P>
<P>
The evening officially ended with a film of Ice Capades highlights. But 
numerous people lingered to chat, reluctant to leave after waiting so long to 
find each other again.

VIEW FINDER / ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY: BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG THEATER 
</P>

<P>
Television broke with tradition this fall when a new family-oriented show 
called "Life Goes On," featuring an actor with Down's syndrome (Chris Burke), 
began airing Sundays at 7 p.m. on ABC. A group of 20 developmentally disabled 
adults in the San Fernando Valley are particularly heartened by the 
breakthrough. They make up a theater company called Brite Lites Theatre that 
for four years has been entertaining community groups and schools in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There is a waiting list to get into the company, which is sponsored by the 
nonprofit San Fernando Valley Assn. for the Retarded. "We have a threefold 
purpose: to mainstream our performers into the community, to promote the agency 
and to entertain. You wouldn't believe the response we get -- standing ovations 
and cheers," says Nancy Banks, the company's founder. 
</P>
<P>
What is most obvious about the company members is their enthusiasm. While many 
may try to imitate Michael Jackson's moves, few can match the intensity of John 
Strabac of Reseda, who sometimes pops the buttons off his shirt as he dances to 
"Bad" in the group's newest revue, called "Rockin' and Rollin'." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the group's members aspire to a show business career. "I'd like to do 
any kind of a TV show," says Keith Garrison of Pacoima, whose favorite shows 
are "Cosby" and "Knight Rider." 
</P>
<P>
Their next public outing will be Dec. 7 at the United Methodist Church in 
Sepulveda. For further information, call (818) 894-9301. 
</P>
<P>
Tying the Knot at Orcutt Ranch 
</P>
<P>
It's the type of place that you can imagine as a family retreat, which it used 
to be. But the 26-acre Orcutt Ranch in West Hills, with its rose garden, citrus 
groves and towering oaks, became the property of the Los Angeles City 
Recreation and Parks Department in 1966. Since then, it has been the site of 
countless weddings. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Orcutt will be getting married in the ranch's rose garden to Mary 
Musick of Van Nuys on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tickled to death that I'm getting married over there," said Orcutt, 
who lives in La Crescenta and works for the Los Angeles City Department of 
Public Works. His grandfather's brother William, the original owner of the 
ranch and a Union Oil geologist, is credited with discovering a slew of oil 
reserves near Santa Maria, as well as alerting paleontologists to the riches of 
the La Brea Tar Pits. The town of Orcutt, Calif. is named after him. 
</P>
<P>
Musick, who has lived in the Valley for only three years, wasn't aware of the 
family's prominence. "I had never heard of the name before I met him. After we 
sent the invitations out, those people who are long to the Valley said, 'Oh, 
you didn't tell me his last name was Orcutt.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Richard Orcutt, the Orcutt and Mulholland families used to be 
"very much involved" with each other. "Mulholland is one of my heroes," he 
said. "He brought water to L.A." Orcutt doesn't intend to belittle his more 
famous relation. It's just that his job as an electric pumping-plant operating 
engineer leaves him more preoccupied with water than oil. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the Times 
</P>
<P>
"Real smart marketers who have figured out the importance of the Hispanic 
market are beginning to do outdoor advertising in the Spanish language," says 
Amy Van Court, who does market analysis for Patrick Media Group, a company with 
more than 7,000 billboards in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick will guide advertisers interested in Spanish-language billboards 
through five areas, including the communities of Pacoima and San Fernando, 
where Spanish-speaking residents make up at least half of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, Spanish-language outdoor advertising was nonexistent. In fact, 
as recently as five years ago there was almost none of it. Now it's growing 
between 10% and 30% a year" in Los Angeles, Van Court says. 
</P>
<P>
There are two types of companies that buy Spanish-language billboards, 
according to Van Court. "The first is those companies who have always used 
outdoor advertising to the general market and who are now running the same ads 
in both languages." She cites Bank of America and Chief Auto Parts as examples. 
</P>
<P>
The second type is the Latino-oriented company, such as Aero California, a 
small airline that flies within Mexico, which advertises exclusively in Spanish 
and doesn't target the general market. 
</P>
<P>
Sleepless Evening Wear 
</P>
<P>
"This is different than underwear as outer wear. This is sleepwear as evening 
wear," says Maryke DeGraff, owner of Monique, a lingerie store in Encino's 
Plaza de Oro. "Some of today's nightgowns could definitely go out of the house 
instead of staying at home in the bedroom. And a nightgown is usually cheaper 
than a dress." 
</P>
<P>
Women's sleepwear has moved beyond pale pastels in skimpy fabrics. "It's 
getting more elegant and sophisticated rather than frilly," DeGraff says. 
"We're going away from traditional feminine flowery looks into colorful prints 
that are a little more geometric, as well as animal prints. Or else florals 
that lend themselves more to a ready-to-wear look rather than a boudoir look." 
</P>
<P>
While pastels will always be strong sellers, many sleepwear manufacturers are 
leaning toward more vibrant colors. "Jewel tones are big," says Jan Marie 
Harvey, designer of the sleepwear line for the lingerie company E. Bole, based 
in Van Nuys. The company's line is sold in Nordstrom, Broadway, Bullock's and 
some boutiques. "And black and white will be very big for spring this season." 
</P>
<P>
Choice of fabrics plays an important role in sleepwear's new dual identity. 
Charmeuse -- a satinlike fabric that drapes smoothly around the body -- is very 
popular, as are washable silks. 
</P>

MAKING SPACE FOR ANOTHER MUSEUM IN PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
ART: WORKSHOPS GROUP FINALLY LANDS A HOME AT RENOVATED ARMORY. BUT INAUGURAL 
EXHIBITION PRESENTS AN UNEVEN MIX OF SOUTHLAND ARTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena hasn't had very good luck maintaining public showplaces for 
contemporary art. All adult artniks remember the 1974 collapse of the Pasadena 
Museum of Modern Art. Even the nice little Baxter Art Gallery at Caltech didn't 
last. One might wonder who needs an art-of-the-moment outpost in a geography 
that boasts the great Norton Simon Museum and the Huntington Gallery, but art 
being made today has its own fascination. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, it now looks like the problem may be solved by the Armory Center for 
the Arts, which opens to the public today at 145 N. Raymond Ave. in Pasadena's 
Old Town. Actually, it looks like several problems may be solved because the 
place is more than just an exhibition hall -- it's one of those enlightened 
combinations of civic redevelopment, educational enthusiasm and aesthetic 
ambition that doesn't appear to have any down side. Just nice, nice, nice. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the Armory is the new home of the 40-odd-year-old Pasadena Art 
Workshops, a private nonprofit group that educates schoolkids in art. The 
Armory's executive director, Elisa Greben Crystal, took time to explain the 
place to a visitor over the din of last-minute preparations. "Now I know why 
people get divorced during house renovations. The noise really is distracting." 
</P>
<P>
She explained that the workshops' approach is to use real artists as teachers 
and to not just have the kids muck about but rather to do projects inspired by 
artworks borrowed from museums. In the old days, they used to come from the 
collection of the Pasadena MOMA when the workshops were attached to it. In 
recent years, the workshops have floated in temporary quarters in various 
schools, borrowing a lot of their teaching examples from UCLA's Museum of 
Cultural History. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, they wanted a permanent roost and, after much poking about in the 
civic possibilities, the city offered the old 1932 Armory building rent-free 
for 15 years if the workshops would kick in the cost of renovation, which 
turned out to be about $630,000. The building had housed the Pasadena Badminton 
Club and the place had gotten so run down that Sylvester Stallone used the main 
hall as a set for a prison dining room in one of his epics. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked pretty awful," Crystal said, "but the minute I saw it I knew there 
was space for a gallery. It will also be used for performances. That beautiful 
floor was already there under layers of paint and grime. It has a sprung dance 
floor so we can have dancers. We're still not sure about the acoustics." 
</P>
<P>
The renovation was designed by Donna Vaccarino and looks neat in a kind of 
Post-Mod gray-and-olive. The facade is simple but has a lot of WPA panache with 
a chiseled American eagle over the portal. 
</P>
<P>
"Arco was a big help," said Crystal, who likes to spread credit around. "They 
loaned us technical people to assist with the renovation and gave us cash 
support. I know my limits and one of them is engineering. Arco has been 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The gym-like main hall is divided. The larger part is the workshop, which looks 
all set for the onslaught of kids -- big tables and huge electric-orange 
plastic barrels labeled Yarn and Rags. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is a 3,000-square-foot gallery with regulation white walls and panels. 
The room is two stories, so the space dribbles upward and may dwarf the art a 
bit, but it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural exhibition was organized by the respected free-floating support 
group the Fellows of Contemporary Art, who chose USC Atelier director Noel 
Korten as curator of this edition of their annual show. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be two years before we'd be able to do an exhibition," said 
Crystal, "but the Fellows were looking for a space so we all lucked out." 
</P>
<P>
It's titled "The Pasadena Armory Show," recalling the epic 1913 Armory 
Exhibition in New York and Chicago that introduced radical European art to 
America, caused huge scandals and brought sophistication to the provinces. 
Unfortunately, the resemblance between the exhibitions ends with the name. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Southland artists of the generation that emerged around the mid-'70s 
are included. Although none of their reputations exceeds that of Local Hero, 
there are talented people here and several ingredients of a punchy show -- 
ambitious installations, large paintings. One work by each artist, which is not 
always a good idea. Almost inexplicably, the ensemble seems bland and 
unfocused, like a lively conversation that never gets to the point. The work 
seems centerless and vaguely timid, almost fearful of telling us what it's up 
to, as if the recent scare about offensive art and cutoffs of National 
Endowment for the Arts funds has made everybody guarded and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable exception is Michael McMillen's "The Tunnel of Babel: 
Pasadena-Peking." The title is lettered on a humorously crude sign above the 
doorway to a scruffy old utility corridor. We see some sort of miniature 
structure at the end, but can't figure it out until we get down there. Turns 
out to be a mini mine shaft with drilling machines busily digging straight 
down: the old joke about tunneling to China. It's a one-liner, but it resonates 
from politics to childhood fantasies. Its charm takes you off guard and 
provokes the only spontaneous reaction in the whole show: a nice delighted 
guffaw. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Davis' "Illuminati" also has things going for it. It's a great junk 
sculpture chandelier of rusty metal loops suspended from the ceiling. It's best 
seen from the old reviewing-stand balcony, where you can identify grotty 
inedible stuff on plates that have hatchets and switch-blade knives for 
silverware. It doesn't quite jell, but it does evoke the creepiness of an Edgar 
Allan Poe short story. 
</P>
<P>
Some protective part of the mind wants to excuse this work. Karen Carson is a 
respected painter, but her mirror-sharded "Butterflys Are Free to Burn" seems 
thwarted. Maybe if there were more examples? The truth is, when we go to the 
Romantics gallery at the Louvre, the individual pieces stand up as masterworks. 
</P>
<P>
What is eating these artists? 
</P>
<P>
Ann Page's installation "Tips" looks like a derelict's lean-to and hints at 
social and political anger, but won't cough it up. John Outterbridge's "The 
Aesthetics of Urban Blight" uses impressive slabs of patinated metal for a 
strong start but fizzles out on a junk sculpture car that's too underscaled for 
its surroundings. Art doesn't have to have a message. It does have to have 
visual rhythm and climax. 
</P>
<P>
John Valadez's painting "Europa II" gets our attention with its visual stew of 
cathedral, classic nudes and a bullfight rendered Leroy Neiman style, but its 
garbled juxtapositions don't resolve. Ditto for Carol Caroompas' illustrative 
montage "Red Riding Hood." 
</P>
<P>
If the show is uneven, you get the feeling the Armory will learn from it and 
get on with its nice mission. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues to Jan. 31. For the record, the other artists are 
William Leavitt, Jerry McMillan, James Doolin, Scott Grieger, Raul Guerrero and 
Margit Omar.

But Will He Triumph?: Producers commonly screen their pictures for potential 
distributors, but Arnold Kopelson ("Platoon") is going to unusual lengths to 
showcase his new film, "Triumph of the Spirit," to land a distribution deal. 
He's holding a special screening tonight at 8 at the high-tech Samuel Goldwyn 
Theater of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Members of the 
Academy, the L.A. Film Critics Assn., the Hollywood Foreign Press and other 
industry figures have been invited to attend -- along with several major 
distributors. Inspired by a real-life story, "Triumph" stars Willem Dafoe as a 
Greek boxing champ forced to fight for his life at the Auschwitz death camp 
during World War II in Poland. ALEENE MacMINN

Hahn's Muddy Encounter: Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual 
encounter with television evangelist Jim Bakker started the downfall of his PTL 
empire, will be hosting a pay-TV special Nov. 10 that features heavy-metal rock 
and female mud wrestling. "It's not 'Masterpiece Theater.' It's a little 
crazy," Hahn says of the show, "Thunder and Mud." "I've got mud in front of me 
and heavy metal behind me. The girls all look great -- I felt like their 
grandmother." Asked if her rock and mud show is denigrating to women, Hahn, 30, 
says no. "It's simply fun television. We're not claiming to be brain surgeons."

COMEDY: NEW COMPANY PRESENTS A COMIC PARABLE ABOUT A CHRISTIAN'S PROTEST 
AGAINST ROMAN BRUTALITY.

CalRep, a new professional company at Cal State Long Beach, chose to open with 
John Clifford's "Lucy's Play," a production that stumbles over misplaced focus. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford's comedy with serious intentions takes place in Syracuse in AD 386 and 
recounts the story of Lucy, who gouged out her eyes as a Christian protest 
against Roman brutality and decadence. She was made a saint. The playwright 
gives the legend an interesting twist. In his eye, Lucy didn't do the deed at 
all, only pretended to. That bit of public relations gimmickry sets up 
Clifford's premise that the Christian movement in the 4th Century had become as 
debased as the Roman Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy's lover, Lucius, back from Christian battlefields, describes horrors of 
war that sound familiar to 20th-Century ears, and indeed the play becomes a 
parable for our own time and our own wars and interventions in the affairs of 
our dependents. 
</P>
<P>
Framed as a fable in its simplistic story-theater treatment, the actors 
greeting the audience at the beginning with "Welcome to our humble stage, our 
warehouse of dreams," "Lucy's Play" suffers from the additional cuteness of 
Joanne Gordon's direction and Herbert Camburn's setting. The writing cries out 
for a more earnest tone, a darker intent in the staging. Clifford's message and 
humor might be able to stand on their own without these silly trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a charming performance by Patricia Boyette as Lucy and a 
sincere reading by John Ross Clark as a secretary with pretensions to power who 
finds his place in the burgeoning Christian hierarchy, the actors do little 
more than trill their lines, as if they're doing a children's play. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy to find a solid core in the middle of the meringue.

DRAMA: THE STORY OF A TRUMPED-UP BRITISH COURT-MARTIAL IS GIVEN ITS U.S. STAGE 
PREMIERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Breaker Morant" is well known as the 1979 Australian film, but the true story 
of a trumped-up British court martial during the Boer War is unfamiliar here as 
a play. 
</P>
<P>
A new repertory company, CalRep, is presenting the American stage premiere, and 
the production is a crackling military drama with first-rate period detail. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Kenneth Ross' drama, the basis for the 1980 Oscar-nominated 
screenplay, echoes the theme of Stanley Kubrick's great anti-war film, "Paths 
of Glory," and jars memories of the aftermath of the My Lai massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Director Ashley Carr and a 10-member cast invest the show with a metallic sheen 
and a crisp rhythm that signal promise for CalRep, which is the resident, 
professional arm of the Department of Theatre Arts at Cal State Long Beach. The 
theater is comfortable and intimate with tiered seating but, a propos of 
sprawling campuses, the site is a devil to find, even with a campus map. 
</P>
<P>
What is striking about the production is its vocal distinction. Rarely do you 
hear actors with such strong diction. We are with Aussies and Brits (in 1902 
South Africa), and the texture of the accents and the pristine delivery rivet 
and propel the action. 
</P>
<P>
The Boer War is grinding to a close. Three bush-ravaged Aussie soldiers are 
hauled up for murdering Boer prisoners of war -- a practice, we learn, that was 
directly encouraged by Britain's own pompous, hypocritical Lord Kitchener (G. 
L. Shoup in a cartoony interpretation that misses the skulduggery of the 
character). 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that the gritty defendants (led by Robert M. Hefley's fiery 
Lt. Harry (Breaker) Morant) parroted commands and shot Boer prisoners upon 
their capture. But the court-martial is a scapegoat job, a political showcase 
for the British, who suddenly want to look fair minded and noble in order to 
get the Boers to sit down at the peace table. After all, Empire building is at 
issue here. 
</P>
<P>
The production's tuning fork is Steve Brady as the defendants' initially 
inexperienced counsel, Maj. Thomas, a man who has drama thrust upon him and 
takes on Kitchener's lackeys with a growing anger that glows with heat. 
</P>
<P>
Two actors, Russell Schmid and Russell St. Clair, are chameleons, playing 
multiple characters with flavorful touches. Ronald Allan-Lindblom's big lug of 
a defendant, Ron Statler's strong-willed president of the court (his bald head 
gleaming like a lamp), and John Ross Clark's dutiful prosecutor are uniformly 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the spit and brass are the coppery tones created by lighting 
designer Bernard J. Skalka, the safari-like beiges, boots and leathers of 
costume designer Judith Tucker-Snider, and the woody, burnished decor of the 
tribunal setting by set designer Herbert L. Camburn. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, Thursday and Friday, also Nov. 11, 
16-17, Dec. 7, 8, 16, Jan. 26-27, Feb. 10, 16-17 at 8 p.m.; a matinee, Nov. 15

ROACH'S DOUBLE QUARTET DEBUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Max Roach, a man most fond of challenging musical situations, led his 
Double Quartet through a variety of settings and moods in its Los Angeles debut 
Tuesday at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which has two LPs on Soul Note under its belt, joins together 
Roach's longtime foursome -- trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater, tenor saxman Odean 
Pope and bassist Tyrone Brown -- with the Uptown String Quartet of Diane Monroe 
and Lesa Terry on violins, Maxine Roach (the leader's daughter) on viola and 
Eileen Folson on cello. 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite a marriage made in heaven . . . but perhaps in time. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tunes successfully melded the bands -- like the serene Pope ballad 
"Sis," where the strings carried the melody. Others, like Bridgewater's bop-ish 
"Bird Says" -- built on the harmonic foundation of the Parker opus, 
"Confirmation" -- found the strings serving a more supporting function, 
offering tasty, cooking background riffs behind the soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Of the up-tempo works, Roach's "A Little Booker" -- dedicated to the great 
trumpeter Booker Little -- did a dandy job of incorporating the strings with 
the jazz quartet in a heated mode. The two groups had an equal hand in 
delivering the jerky-like-a-jeep-on-a-bumpy-road melody line, then, with Roach 
and Brown building a rhythmic blaze, the strings darted in and out with lines 
that added color to the soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The strings were in the spotlight on "Let Us Break Bread Together," which had 
an Americana flavor, and on Oscar Pettiford's "Tricotism," where Monroe 
strummed her instrument while Folson, in the set's lone string improvisation, 
played a pizzicato solo that had some good ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgewater, employing a crackling sound, was superb throughout, delivering 
snappy lines that were imbued with a tuneful lyricism. Pope's tone was somewhat 
flabby, and his solos relied on a surging energy for their effect. Roach, ever 
the resilent trapsman, and Brown never let their cohorts down. 
</P>
<P>
The group's drawback is that the strings are not yet fully integrated with the 
jazz quartet. If that was a matter of adapting to the room, it will no doubt be 
worked out by the group's Sunday night closing. ZAN STEWART

BILLY SQUIER'S TREAT AT GREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Squier came up with a great guise for his Halloween concert at the Greek 
Theatre: a rockin' Rip Van Winkle. Though he hasn't slumbered 20 years, 
Squier's time away -- three years between records, five since his last tour -- 
has been plenty for his pro forma arena rock to be rendered completely 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Squier's treat for taking the trouble of his comeback trick? His new album, 
"Hear &amp; Now," has barely clung to the bottom of the Top 200 in its 16 weeks 
of release, and the Greek was only half full on Tuesday. OK, back when 
Mellencamp was still Cougar such Squier songs as "The Stroke" and "Rock Me 
Tonight" had their place, and his 1982 Top Tenner "Everybody Wants You" is 
built on a cool riff that's still hard to shake. But that was the lone 
highlight of Tuesday's set, which was otherwise notable only for its relatively 
frill-free proficiency and huge display of ego. (A giant portrait of yourself 
as a backdrop, Billy? C'mon!) 
</P>
<P>
Opening act King's X is a rarer breed: a mainstream hard-rock band that has 
actually inspired positive intellectual discussion, particularly in Christian 
circles. Though its brief set showed a progressive-metal band still at a 
developmental stage, with a tendency to plod instead of rock, the Houston trio 
is worth keeping an eye on, especially if its music can one day match the 
fairly poetic way its lyrics address their questions about and faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the very existence of second-billed Blue Murder -- composed 
of several hoary hard-rock veterans and even hoarier hard-rock cliches -- could 
be used as evidence that there is no God. STEVE HOCHMAN

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: REDUCING FAT INTAKE A CONFUSING ISSUE, BUT GUIDELINES 
CAN HELP CUT USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Why is it," a health-conscious friend complained recently, "that you 
nutritionists are always making it more complicated to choose a healthy diet?" 
</P>
<P>
His lament referred to selecting fats for cooking and table spreads. For the 
past several years, he had paid close attention to reports on TV and radio and 
in newspapers chronicling research findings on how different types of fat 
affect serum cholesterol. The payoff, he observed wistfully, is that he feels 
confused about exactly what he should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone. Experts agree that reducing saturated fat is the most critical 
step in modifying fat intake to lower serum cholesterol. Yet the role of 
unsaturated fat, and the mix of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats we 
should consume, is far less clear. For such a complex question, it will take 
years of study, not the findings of any single project, to reach an answer. 
</P>
<P>
The other confusing factor in fat selection is the proliferation of butter 
alternatives and the advertising that accompanies them, tapping into some piece 
of the message for a healthy heart. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion, we have to make decisions at the grocery store, in the 
kitchen, and all other places where we buy, prepare and eat food throughout the 
day. Luckily, there are some simple guidelines recommended to ease the process. 
</P>
<P>
Start by assuming you could use less fat in your diet. Although consumption has 
been dropping, the typical American gets considerably more fat than the current 
recommendation of 30% of total calories. The best approach to trimming fat is 
simply to eat lean: Choose low-fat or skim-milk dairy products, buy lean cuts 
of meat and eat smaller servings, use more chicken and fish, cook with a 
minimum of fat and use it sparingly at the table. 
</P>
<P>
For many people, this strategy might be all that's needed to reach the target 
of 30% of total calories, as well as to create a diet where no more than 10% of 
the fat is saturated, with the rest evenly split between monounsaturates and 
polyunsaturates. At nine calories per gram, fat is the most calorie-dense of 
the energy nutrients, compared to four per gram for either carbohydrate or 
protein. Thus, cutting back on fat might also mean you'll shed extra pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If step one is to take a well-sharpened paring knife to the fat -- especially 
saturated -- in your diet, step two is to make informed choices about those 
fats you do buy for cooking and table spreads. Where oils are concerned, you 
can choose according to usage. 
</P>
<P>
For sauteing, take one of the many flavorless oils available. For salad 
dressings or dishes with a Mediterranean flavor, olive oil makes the zestiest 
choice. It should be used sparingly, so the fruitier the better. And in many 
Oriental dishes, peanut oil -- like olive, rich in monounsaturates and also 
carrying a distinctive flavor -- might be your pick. Again, a little goes a 
long way. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. When you hit the dairy case, however, you may feel lost in a 
jungle of products. Bear in mind this generalization: A tablespoon of regular, 
stick margarine, 80% fat and 20% water by weight, is calorically comparable to 
butter, providing 100 calories per tablespoon. 
</P>
<P>
Checking at the market, we found that all but three stick margarines provided 
labeling information. All except one contained two grams of saturated fat per 
tablespoon and one to three grams of polyunsaturated fat. Curiously, all but 
one manufacturer used a tablespoon as the serving size. This one exception used 
a teaspoon, which contained a gram of saturated fat. Multiply that by the three 
teaspoons to a tablespoon and you'll find the product more highly saturated 
than other brands. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three unlabeled margarines, two were made from partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oil, and it's unknown how saturated they are. The label on the third 
states that it "contains liquid corn oil," but again, we don't know whether 
it's hydrogenated and therefore more saturated. Among tub margarines, the one 
containing the most saturated fat used a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon as 
the portion of choice, thereby misleading the unwary consumer. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when these margarines are modified by whipping in water? Calories 
are reduced, but how much varies by brand. Consumers can make their selection 
both on taste and on desire to cut calories. Clearly, there's no getting around 
not reading the labels. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a line of products whose appeal is unabashedly based on being 
a butter taste-alike. It may or may not achieve that objective. But, not 
surprisingly, the addition of butter boosts its quota of saturated fat. In 
making comparisons between this and other margarines, always remember to check 
for portion size. Otherwise, you may be getting more saturated fat than you 
bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
Not All Shellfish Have Excessive Cholesterol 
</P>
<P>
Question: I was sure I'd read in your column that most shellfish are no richer 
in cholesterol than lean meat or chicken. The other night I dined with a friend 
who says he knows all about the ins and outs of a cholesterol-lowering diet. He 
passed up scallops because, he said, they are a potent source of cholesterol. I 
thought he was wrong, but he was adamant. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are. Assuming that the scallops weren't prepared with a lot of oil 
or margarine and weren't afloat in either melted butter or a rich cream sauce, 
they are not only low in cholesterol but also low in both fat and saturated 
fat. The scallops themselves, before any fat is added, contain less than a gram 
of fat and just 95 calories. 
</P>
<P>
To spare your friend's feelings, you can explain that his confusion is 
understandable. The problem is that at the time a link between dietary factors 
and serum cholesterol was first established, laboratory methods for analysis of 
dietary cholesterol were relatively primitive compared to today's fine-tuning. 
As a result, other compounds, which are chemically similar, were measured as 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
This error inflated the early values for shellfish. Although the mistake was 
later rectified, old learning has died a slow death. Many people, such as your 
dining companion, cling like limpets to the belief that shellfish are all rich 
in cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, many shellfish contain little. For example, three ounces of clams, 
mussels, oysters or scallops provide between 30 and 50 milligrams. That amount 
is considerably less than the 80 milligrams you would get from the same portion 
of veal, beef or chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The same amount of lobster contains somewhat more, about 90 milligrams. How 
much there is in shrimp depends on species, anywhere from as little as 60 
milligrams in Japanese prawns to three times that amount in the white Atlantic 
varieties. Squid, a mollusk most people do not recognize as such, contains 180 
milligrams of cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that ground beef does not keep as well as whole cuts, but I haven't 
the foggiest notion why. Can you enlighten me? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are two reasons why ground beef deteriorates more readily than a roast 
or even chunks cut for stew. For one thing, ground beef is often made from 
trimmings, so it has been handled more than larger pieces of meat. The handling 
process increases exposure to bacteria. For another, grinding the meat greatly 
multiplies the exposed surface area. That exposed area is an open playing field 
for bacteria naturally present in the environment. While these organisms are 
not harmful, they can cause a breakdown in quality, and even spoilage, if 
handled improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Because ground meat deteriorates so quickly, it should be held in the 
refrigerator for no more than a couple of days. If you don't get a chance to 
use it up within that time, you have several choices. One is to brown the meat 
well and use it in a cooked dish such as spaghetti sauce or chili, which can be 
eaten within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, it should be frozen. If you do choose to freeze it, remember 
that the best way to thaw it is in the refrigerator. Thawing meat on the 
counter is not recommended. That method allows the outer layer to warm to a 
temperature where bacteria thrive, while the inside remains solid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was preparing a batch of corn muffins when my mother offered to "help." 
She had never used corn meal before and when she opened a new box she wailed in 
dismay at the black specks inside. I assured her that it was perfectly fine and 
that those specks were always present in corn meal. She was dissatisfied with 
my answer. Can you tell my mother that I know what I'm talking about? 
</P>
<P>
A: Those black specks are indeed a natural part of the corn kernel. Corn 
kernels, like other grains, have three basic parts: the bran (or outer husk), 
the germ and the endosperm. These black specks, called the "hilar layer," are 
found at the base of the germ and connect it to the rest of the kernel. During 
milling, the hilar layer remains with the endosperm, and shows up as the dark 
specks you describe.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: TWO NEW CORDLESS IRONS OFFER MORE FLEXIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cordless irons have returned to the limelight after an unsuccessful spark some 
years ago. The initial reaction from consumers was good -- a dream come true 
for many ironers who wanted that cord out of the way of the iron. The cords 
disappeared indeed but the wrinkles didn't. Returns were heavy and users 
complained of the following: the units didn't produce enough heat or enough 
steam, and some were even dripping. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cordless mode is so convenient and fast when ironing lightweight 
articles or for maneuvering easily and quickly around tablecloths, sheets, 
silks, curtains or awkward pleats, the idea didn't die. Two new cordless irons 
have just been unveiled and could be the solution to the pressing problems of 
the first products. There's Tefal Freeline 50 ($99.99) from France and 
Rowenta's Mode 2 (CS-01) Cord/Cordless Iron ($110) from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Both products are now hot items in Europe and are expected to pick up more 
sales volume in the year to come. Rowenta is playing the safe game by adding 
the corded adaptability in their Mode 2. (To iron with the cord, you can easily 
attach the adapter with a cord to the iron by unlocking it from the charging 
base.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of this dual flexibility, the iron was much better received than the 
single cordless, gaining consumer trust, according to Paul Pofcher, Rowenta's 
general manager. "Sometimes you need the power of a cord iron when ironing 
denims and linens," he explained, "the technology of a continuous high ironing 
power does not exist." 
</P>
<P>
A cordless iron undoubtedly picks up heat from a charging corded base. After 
closely examining ironing habits, Rowenta's study revealed that people iron for 
only seven to 15 seconds before adjusting the material being ironed. The 
company designed an iron and base that allows recharging to an ideal ironing 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Its 1200 wattage promises greater heat and steam while its increased use of 
metal mass (copper and chromium shield plus the iron's all metal body) makes 
for better heat retention. Another important design feature is the angled base 
on which the iron rests. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most stressful part of ironing is when you lift and set back the 
iron flat on its heel," Pofcher said. "our unit slides back on its angled base 
in a natural motion." In other words it eliminates the need to continuously 
wrench wrists backward to rest the iron. 
</P>
<P>
Other advantages in this ironing system include a transparent water tank that's 
removable, and capacity for two steam power levels and a fine mist spray. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Tefal, favored by many consumers for its smooth gliding 
soleplate, powerful steam and water spray plus self-cleaning feature. Tefal's 
sleek-looking cordless version has all these features plus more. The 1500-watt 
Freeline 50 retains heat for three minutes and recharges quickly when set back 
on its flat corded base, which has a hidden cord storage. It also has a 
removable anti-clogging valve and a safety thermal cut-off, meaning you don't 
need to worry if you leave the iron on -- it will shut off automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Tefal's Durilium soleplate has a 10-year warranty. The ultra-smooth plate has 
been tested to glide over zippers without scratching its surface. The test also 
proved that the force required to handle an iron with this plate was 
considerably less than with alternative materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rowenta Mode 2 Cord/Cordless Iron is available at Bullock's, Buffum's and 
Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tefal Freeline 50 Iron will be available mid-November at Bullock's.

CARE AND KEEPING OF BANANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you bring home a bunch of bananas, you'll want to store them properly so 
they will stay fresh for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Green-tip bananas will reach their peak of ripeness if you take them out of the 
plastic produce bag and keep them at room temperature. This enables them to 
continue the ripening process and in just a few days they will be tender enough 
for eating. 
</P>
<P>
To store bananas for a longer time, keep them in the refrigerator. The peel 
will darken but the fruit inside will stay ripe and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Bananas will keep for the longest possible time in the freezer. Just mash the 
fruit with a little lemon juice and freeze it in an airtight container. 
Defrosted, it is perfect to use in a favorite baked goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Back in July when "Culinary SOS" reader Patti requested a recipe 
for Gilliland's Irish Bread Pudding, Gilliland's in Santa Monica replied to the 
request for the recipe by sending a soda bread recipe in error. We printed the 
recipe anyway, with a word that when the bread pudding recipe arrived we would 
test and print it. So here it is. As suspected, the pudding is outstanding, one 
of the best we've had in a long time. 
</P>
<P>

DEAR SOS: We'd love the recipe for Porcupine Meatballs served by our friends as 
appetizers, using ground meat and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CAROLINE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CAROLINE: Good timing with the holiday season coming up. Actually the rice 
acts as an extender, making the meatballs tasty, full texture and budget-minded 
too. 
</P>
<P>
PORCUPINE MEATBALLS 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup rice 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 green pepper, sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups tomato juice 
</P>

Dash ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
Combine meat, rice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Mix well and shape 
into 8 balls 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place in shallow baking dish. For 
appetizer size meat balls, form into 3/4-inch balls. 
</P>
<P>
Brown green pepper and onion lightly in oil. Add tomato juice, nutmeg and salt 
and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and pour over meatballs. Cover and bake at 
350 degrees 1 hour or until rice is tender. Makes 4 main dish or 8 to 10 
appetizer servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: While dining at The Broadway in Thousand Oaks, we had a terrific 
frozen fruit salad that was served with small sandwiches. I would love to have 
a recipe for this salad or one similar to it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BARBARA: How about one similar to it. It's a salad that goes back to the 
'40s and '50s, when refrigerator-freezers emerged on the scene. The salads are 
great for holiday luncheons and brunch. 
</P>
<P>
FROZEN FRUIT SALAD 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sliced dried figs

1 (11-ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, flour and honey. Bring to boil. Stir lemon juice into egg, then 
into honey mixture. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. 
Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in figs, coconut and oranges. Whip cream and fold into fruit mixture. Pour 
into refrigerator tray or individual molds. Freeze until firm. Makes about 8

COOK IT LIGHT: SPECIAL VERSION OF WILD RICE DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeanne Jones, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: This rice dish is one of my favorites for the holidays or for any 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered if you could decrease its calories and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARY, Buffalo Grove, Ill.

<P>
WILD RICE CASSEROLE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup wild rice 
</P>
<P>
1 pound mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
Butter 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup long-grain white rice 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sliced almonds 
</P>
<P>
3 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Wash wild rice and cover with boiling water. Soak 1 hour, then drain. Saute 
mushrooms and onion in 1 tablespoon butter. 
</P>
<P>
Combine wild rice, white rice, sauteed mushrooms and onion, 5 tablespoons 
butter, salt, pepper, almonds, broth and whipping cream. Place in greased 
2-quart casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Bake, covered, at 350 degrees 1 1/2 hours. Remove cover, top with Parmesan 
cheese and dot with butter. Bake at 425 degrees 5 minutes more. Makes about 7 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARY: This is an excellent recipe. However, if you want to enjoy this 
casserole often, there are some changes that will make that possible without 
compromising your family's health. 
</P>
<P>
The changes I have made result in a lighter and more delicately flavored dish 
that is much less greasy and far better for you. For example, by toasting the 
almonds before adding them to the casserole, you can get by with half as many 
without losing their wonderful flavor. 
</P>
<P>
I used long-grain brown rice instead of white in my revision because I like its 
nutty flavor, but long-grain white rice also works. 
</P>

HINTS FROM HELOISE: EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAS ANOTHER USE, EVEN RUINED STOVE-BURNER 
COVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I love those decorative stove-burner covers, but it never fails: 
I burn one a month. For some reason I turn the wrong burner on. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I have about five burned covers, I didn't throw them away. They're 
great to use as saucers under potted plants. It's nice to know I didn't waste 
anything. There's usually another use for something other than what it was made 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TERRI, Miami 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: After mixing most of the ingredients for a recipe, I reached for 
the brown sugar only to discover it was as hard as a rock. I came up with a 
great idea. I grated the sugar with my cheese grater. I couldn't believe how 
well it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JODI, Portland 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Whenever I gave my children soup for lunch they would burn their 
mouths because they were in a hurry to get back out and play. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't happen any more since I put an ice cube in each bowl of soup. I 
tell them to stir it until it melts, then the soup is ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CAROL, Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm usually the mom that is elected to make cupcakes for my 
child's class. It was always a messy job using the ladle to fill each cup. The 
batter dripped all over, but I've solved that problem. I use a pitcher. It 
fills the cups without spills and I don't waste a drop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LAURA, Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've been married only a few months and everything about cooking 
is new to me. I've made a few good meals but there's one thing I desperately 
need help with: making gravy. 
</P>
<P>
How do I make brown gravy without lumps? I put flour in hot meat drippings but 
it always comes out full of lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CARRIE, Phoenix 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CARRIE: One of the tricks is to use cold water. In a small jar, mix 
together flour and enough cold water to make a thin liquid, put the lid on and 
shake vigorously to dissolve all lumps. Then all you have to do is add it to 
the drippings and mix as you're pouring it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Not long ago I read a hint in your column on keeping plastic 
grocery bags stored neatly. I have another tip that works great too. 
</P>
<P>
When I grocery shop I ask for plastic bags instead of paper. All I did was bend 
the ends of a hanger all the way up and hung it on a nail in my pantry. I slip 
the handles of the bags over the ends of the hanger. It holds quite a few bags 
and keeps them neat and orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I recently went to a party a friend had and she had a clever idea 
for a condiment holder. She served a dip for vegetables in a bell pepper. She 
simply cut off the top of the pepper, removed the seeds, then rinsed it well 
and added the dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GLORIA, Cincinnati, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: A friend and I are in disagreement over storage of an opened 
bottle of catsup. 
</P>
<P>
I say that after opening the bottle, it should be stored in the refrigerator. 
My friend says that there are no printed directions anywhere on the bottle 
instructing refrigeration after opening so he stores his opened bottle in a 
kitchen cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
I always thought it was common knowledge to store an opened catsup bottle in 
the refrigerator. Does it hurt if it's not refrigerated? Which way is correct? 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARY, Elizabethtown, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARY: The proper way to store a bottle of catsup after opening it is 
solely up to the user unless your particular brand states that it should be 
refrigerated after opening (most do not). The vinegar content in catsup acts as 
a preservative, which enables most brands to be stored on the pantry shelf 
after opening. 
</P>
<P>
If you do not use catsup often, you might want to store an opened bottle in the 
refrigerator to help it retain longer-lasting flavor, since storing an opened 
bottle at room temperature on a pantry shelf will reduce its shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
The decision mainly involves the label directions, usage and your personal 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE

DEAR HELOISE: After unsuccessfully searching through several stores that 
specialize in kitchen products, I hit upon a wonderful idea for a way to 
transfer those chopped vegetables from my cutting board to my wok. 
</P>
<P>
I purchased a brightly colored plastic dustpan. After chopping all my 
vegetables, I load them all on the dustpan and add them to the wok all at once, 
instead of handfuls at a time. 
</P>
<P>
My "vegetable dustpan" has proven to be very helpful in my kitchen and I have 
instructed my family that it does not go on the floor for collecting dirt. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I found the easiest way to get up the stuff in the oven when 
cleaning it. 
</P>
<P>
I use a short-handled window squeegee to scrape all the stuff into the center 
of the oven, then onto a piece of paper and into the garbage. I wipe down the 
inside of the oven with a wet rag and it's finished. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here's a hint to keep salt shakeable from the salt shaker even 
during the most humid months. 
</P>
<P>
I have heard about putting crushed crackers or rice inside the salt shaker to 
keep it free-flowing, but I just upend a small clear jelly glass over the 
shaker. This keeps the salt dry as a bone and always ready for a quick shake.

WINE NOTES: A NEW LOOK, BOTTLE FOR BLUE NUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its long history, Blue Nun wine will not have a nun 
dominating its label. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based firm H. Sichel Sohne, which has produced Blue Nun in Germany 
for 64 years, said the Liebfraumilch wine will be adorned with an eggshell 
white label with a gold rim. Above the type is a small, stylized depiction of a 
nun, a fraction of the size of past labels. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the wine will be bottled in a taller, tapered bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Peter M. F. Sichel, whose family firm markets Blue Nun in the United States, 
said the wine, which has a good dose of Riesling in its composition, once was 
sweeter than it now is, and as a drier wine than it has been is now aimed more 
at pairing with food. This necessitated a change in the label, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gradual change (in the label design), which encompassed reducing the 
number of nuns on the label, was insufficient to keep pace with the evolving 
world of consumer packaging," said Sichel. 
</P>
<P>
After eight different packaging concepts were tested, and after 1,200 personal 
interviews were conducted, the new design was selected. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Blue Nun is a better wine than many vintages of the past that were 
sweeter. The wine retails for about $5.50 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon Vineyards in Santa Cruz Country, who has an abiding 
interest in making wines from grape varieties native to the Rhone Valley in 
France, has formed a joint venture with a Spanish wine maker. 
</P>
<P>
The informal project, which as yet has not been finalized, calls for red wine 
from the Grenache grape, widely planted in the Rhone, to be produced in Spain 
under the direction of Grahm. 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Boyle, an associate of Grahm's at Bonny Doon, said the joint partner is 
Carlos Falco de Fernandez de Cordova, the Marques de Grinon, who has a small 
winery that produces Cabernet Sauvignon outside Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlos stopped by on a visit some time ago and Randall asked him, 'Why are you 
making Cabernet when Garnacha is planted all over Spain?' And that convinced 
him that there was some killer Garnacha lurking around," said Boyle. Garnacha 
is the Spanish name for Grenache. 
</P>
<P>
An enologist for the Spanish winery worked at Bonny Doon for two weeks this 
harvest to see how Bonny Doon makes its wines, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the joint venture, Garnacha will be harvested next year and the wine made 
to Grahm's specifications. Some trial lots of wine were made this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the venture is looking into using the Mourvedre grape too, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beckstoffer House and a structure at St. Supery winery were among five 
buildings honored by Napa County Landmarks Inc. at its 1989 Awards of Merit for 
architectural preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Beckstoffer House was built in 1884 as an apartment building and renoted in 
1981 after it was bought by wine grower Andy Beckstoffer. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Supery winery building is a redesign of museum designer Gordon Ashby. 
The Queen Anne Victorian structure was originally the home of the founders of 
the property, the Atkinson family, and was called the Atkinson Manor House. 
</P>
<P>
The redesign was carried out under the auspices of the owner of St. Supery, the 
Skalli family of Paris and Sete, France. 
</P>
<P>
The Carneros is one of California's best regions for consistent wines, and 
three new releases of the last few weeks are testament to the marvelous fruit 
found in this cool region that bridges the southern portions of the Napa Valley 
and Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Vineyards' just-released 1987 Winery Lake Pinot Noir ($20) is more 
impressive than Sterling's first release from the Winery Lake Vineyard, the 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The aroma of the wine is reminiscent of delicate fresh cherries scented with 
cloves and nutmeg along with a light peppery quality and a trace of fresh 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Charles F. Shaw Winery, which has specialized in Gamay Beaujolais since its 
founding in 1979, is releasing a small quantity of a 1987 Pinot Noir made from 
Carneros-grown fruit. 
</P>
<P>
It is the winery's first Pinot Noir, and only 200 cases of it were made by wine 
maker Ric Forman. However, 600 cases were produced in 1988 and 900 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $14, the 1987 wine is an excellent rendition of Pinot Noir, with deep 
ripe-cherry flavors and a delicate hint of anise. 
</P>
<P>
This wine will be available at a limited number of Los Angeles- and San 
Francisco-area wine shops as well as by mail from the winery. For details, 
write to Charles F. Shaw Winery, 1010 Big Tree Road, St. Helena, Calif. 94574. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these wines exhibit delicate hints of citrus-like notes that add to the 
impression that they will age beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
Cuvaison Winery in the Napa Valley has released a stunning 1988 Chardonnay 
($15), the winery's best effort to date. 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker John Thatcher used only Carneros fruit for this wine, and the result 
is bright citrus fruit, lemony and spicy, but with a light pineapple element 
and a faint toasty note that adds depth to an already inviting wine. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is to make a wine that is so intriguing that you keep going back to 
your glass for another sip," said Thatcher.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: MEAT LOAF RECIPES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VERSATILITY OF LEAN 
GROUND BEEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report released earlier this year explained that ground beef and whole milk 
are responsible for most of the fat in the American diet. They account for 
about 9% of the total dietary saturates, according to the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, ground beef is one of the most popular items in the meat case. It has 
remained a staple in the American diet, appearing on dinner tables and in 
restaurant menus in the form of hamburgers, meat loaves and in casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
But with careful label reading and sensible meal planning, ground beef can have 
a place in a healthy diet. Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
The ground beef label will provide the amount of fat present in the ground beef 
package. The terms regular, lean, and extra lean refer to the fat content of 
the meat: regular, 30%; lean, 23%, and extra lean, about 15%. Fat content also 
may be stated as "not less than 75% lean," which means that 75% of the meat is 
lean ground beef and the remaining 25% is fat. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fat cannot be removed from ground beef before cookingthorough 
draining is recommended. During cooking, higher-fat ground beef (regular) will 
lose fat and may end up being similar to cooked lean. The leaner ground beef 
loses water during cooking. To further reduce fat content, use half ground 
poultry and half ground beef in recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Meat labeled as ground beef should contain only beef and no trimmings from 
other meat, although beef from various cuts may be mixed in one grinding. When 
leaner cuts are used in grinding, additional fat is added for flavor and 
tenderness. Strict fat-watchers should consult the butcher. Use garlic, fresh 
herbs, celery seeds or hot pepper sauce for seasoning ground beef, and select 
vegetables that are strong in flavor such as mushrooms, peppers, onions, 
shallots, chives and leeks to enhance the natural flavor of the meat. Other 
distinctive flavoring ingredients include brown sugar, cloves, fresh ginger, 
lemon juice and wine. 
</P>
<P>
The following meat loaf recipes take advantage of the versatility of lean 
ground beef. Ground poultry has been added to cut down on the fat, but equal 
amounts of lean ground meat can be substituted. 
</P>

TEACHERS WANT VOICES HEARD IN HOT WHITTIER SCHOOL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still frustrated by their longest-ever contract dispute last year, teachers in 
the Whittier City School District want their voices to be heard in Tuesday's 
election -- making the quest for three open school board seats one of the 
hottest battles in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, teachers in the 6,000-student district in the heart of 
Whittier have formed a political action committee and pledged to support three 
candidates: Owen Newcomer, Reed Wilson and Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee have walked door-to-door, written letters to voters 
and held yard sales to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been politically active before, but not at this level," said Barbara 
Gaborko, president of the Whittier Elementary Teachers Assn. "We are trying to 
elect people who are understanding and have empathy for what goes on in the 
classroom. We have not felt we have had that for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the teachers and district officials battled for nine months over 
details of a new contract. The teachers wanted a 7% pay increase but settled 
for 5% just before a planned strike. 
</P>
<P>
Hard feelings persist, Gaborko said. The election could help heal the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates, including one incumbent, are running for three seats on the 
school board. Board members Ermila Corral and Janet Henke are retiring. 
Candidates include: 
</P>
<P>
James Albanese, vice president of business services at Mt. San Antonio College. 
Albanese has been active in school issues since the 1970s. His wife served on 
the school board from 1972 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Mildred A. Early. Running for a fourth term, she has been on the 
board for 12 years and involved in school issues since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Kersley, a librarian at the Rosemead Library. She has two children 
enrolled in the Whittier district. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Mathews, a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. (Mac) McFarland is president of McFarland Energy Co. in Santa Fe Springs. 
He has three children in the district, which is what prompted him to become 
involved in school politics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Newcomer, a political science and speech teacher at Rio Hondo College. He 
is a member of the Rio Hondo teacher's union and is currently negotiating for a 
new contract. 
</P>
<P>
A. Roy Salas, a business development loan officer for a commercial lending 
company. Salas has served on school boards for the Los Nietos and Whittier 
Union High School districts. This is the first time he has run in the Whittier 
City School District. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Thomas, a teacher in the Los Nietos school district. He has also been 
active in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Wilson, an accountant for Powerine Oil Co. in Santa Fe Springs. He has two 
children and has been active in parent-teacher groups for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Unified 
</P>
<P>
A dentist and a chiropractor are vying for a seat on the Board of Education of 
the Downey Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Riley, a 49-year-old dentist who was first elected to the board in 
1981, faces chiropractor Donald K. Hopkins, 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Education Assn., which represents district teachers, has made no 
formal endorsement, but it is telling members in its newsletter that Hopkins 
would be more sympathetic to teachers if elected. 
</P>
<P>
Association Executive Director Richard Ruether said Riley has consistently 
opposed salary increases for teachers during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said this week that he supports good salaries for teachers but that he 
has opposed some raises because it was unclear whether the district would have 
enough money in the future to cover higher personnel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, whose wife, Cynthia, teaches math in the district, said he supports 
giving the district's instructors good wages to do good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The term of office is four years, and board members receive a $400 monthly 
stipend. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Grace E. Horney and Walter S. Temple are running unopposed. 
Horney was first elected in 1965, while Temple began serving on the board in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
East Whittier City Schools 
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates, including one incumbent, are running for three seats and one 
unexpired term on the East Whittier City School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Hodgin, owner of an interior design business, is seeking reelection. She 
has served on the board for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include Susan Hunter Eiden, a teacher at a junior high school 
in East Los Angeles; Michael E. Martinet, personnel director for the city of 
Bell Gardens; David Perry, a truck driver; Benjamin Rich, economics teacher at 
El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera; R.F. Valdez, owner of a bookstore in 
Whittier; Cathy Warner, a dental hygienist; and David F. Weitzel, a physician's 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Board members James Stewart and Shirley Nielson have stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Harris, a businesswoman, and C. Randy King are competing to fill the 
unexpired term of Fred Campbell, who resigned in August because he moved out of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
El Rancho Unified 
</P>
<P>
Five candidates are vying for three vacancies on the El Rancho Unified School 
District board. They are: incumbents Frank P. Boyce, 49, and E. A. (Pete) 
Ramirez, 51; and candidates Dimas M. Benavides, 45; Frank Millan, 54, and Mary 
Lou Ramirez, 51. 
</P>
<P>
Benavides and Millan said they were drawn into the race over an erroneous 
dropout rate report released by the state. The report, which listed a 50.2% 
dropout rate, was based on numbers that were accidentally submitted to the 
state. El Rancho Supt. Thomas Sakalis said the rate is actually 19.9% for the 
district's 13,200-member student body. In their literature and slogans, all of 
the candidates are responding to parents' concerns about the dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
Little Lake City Elementary 
</P>
<P>
Three candidates are competing for two board seats on the Little Lake City 
Elementary School District board. The candidates are May Sharp, 57, an 
incumbent and homemaker; Angel Obregon, 38, manager of governmental relations 
for the California Trucking Assn., and Armida Trujillo, 52, a homemaker and 
community volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The district enrolls 4,124 students in kindergarten through eighth grade in 
Santa Fe Springs, Norwalk and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Los Nietos 
</P>
<P>
Five candidates are running for three school board seats in the Los Nietos

OFFICIALS ACT TO END TRAFFIC JAMS AT 12 CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Glendale city officials have joined forces with police and school district 
leaders to try to untangle growing traffic congestion and safety problems 
caused by parents who drop off their youngsters at elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Daily congestion has become monumental before and after school at 12 of 19 
Glendale Unified School District elementary schools, city and police officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This year has been the worst by far," said Lt. Rodger Simon, commander of the 
police traffic bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said growing numbers of parents "seem to desire to drive their children 
as close as they can to the entrance to the school and to even park or 
double-park long enough to see the child actually enter the school building." 
</P>
<P>
He attributed much of the problem to an influx of immigrant families, which 
have swelled enrollment in the last four years. Such families are sometimes 
unfamiliar with traffic rules and are afraid to let their children walk to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been massive tie-ups, with the worst congestion at R. D. White, 
Keppel, Columbus, Edison and Muir schools, Simon said. At the request of school 
officials, Glendale City Council members last month directed the city manager 
and traffic engineer to work with the school district and police to resolve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officers are being assigned to two or three schools every morning and 
afternoon to cite violators. However, their efforts are not enough, even though 
the city increased the traffic enforcement staff from eight to 14 officers in 
the last year, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials have proposed that members of parent-teacher groups be 
authorized to issue warnings to drivers who double-park and violate other 
traffic rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a school district problem. It is a city problem," said Joann 
Merrick, district director of elementary education. "Worse yet, it is a parent 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Many parents drop their children off in the middle of the block across the 
street from a school and tell the youngsters to dash through traffic, she said. 
Two children were slightly injured in September when they were hit by a car as 
they ran through traffic in front of R. D. White School, Merrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district is in the process of reviving its 1970s' "Safe School 
Route" program, designed to encourage more students to walk to school. Maps 
showing the location of crossing guards, traffic signals and other safety 
measures will be distributed within a week or two to students with notes to 
parents in English, Spanish, Armenian and Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
City and school officials are studying each of the campuses to determine what 
other measures can be taken to relieve congestion, such as posting signs and 
painting curbs around schools to keep parents from parking while dropping off 
or picking up children. 
</P>
<P>
In a pilot program at Keppel, where 1,160 children attend class in the same 
neighborhood with a junior and senior high school, classes this year have been 
staggered over a 30-minute starting period to reduce the morning congestion, 
Principal Gordon C. Morse said. Similar programs are being considered at other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are also considering whether to use playground space at some 
schools, such as R. D. White, for a drive-through, pickup and drop-off route. 
Merrick said a route could be opened at White as early as next semester. 
However, she said, playgrounds at most schools are too small and lack access to 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Every school has a different traffic problem," Merrick said. "It's a matter of 
educating the parents and the students, and the fact that these schools have a 
lot more kids than they were intended to have."

GRANT AIDS ARMENIAN REFUGEE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled with $385,000 in federal funds, a Glendale-based Armenian relief 
organization this week initiated a program to help Soviet Armenian refugees 
adjust to life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The program at the Armenian Relief Society, a private, nonprofit aid group with 
a large Glendale chapter, includes acculturation classes and counseling for 
refugees. It is one of three to be run by Armenian organizations in Los Angeles 
County with $1.2 million allocated by the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the grant, society social workers will counsel the refugees both 
in private and in group sessions, visit their homes and conduct English 
classes, job training programs and help place them in jobs, said Sarkis 
Ghazarian, director of social services at the Armenian Relief Service in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The money was awarded to the county by the federal government in July, but 
allocation of the funds was contingent on approval by the County Board of 
Supervisors. The board approved the awards Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
County refugee relief coordinator Joan Pinchuk called the federal money "a drop 
in the bucket, but hopefully a pretty big drop." She applied for the money on 
behalf of the Armenian organizations more than a year ago to deal with an 
influx of more than 31,000 Armenian emigres who have settled in the county 
since October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Armenian refugees have been settling in Glendale at the rate of about 
250 a month since early this year, Ghazarian said. They are joining friends and 
relatives in an Armenian community that is spread throughout Glendale, 
Hollywood and parts of the San Gabriel Valley. It is the largest Armenian 
community in the world outside of Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers who deal with the refugees say that refugee resettlement 
programs are inadequate to help the Soviet Armenians, who generally leave the 
Soviet Union so fast that they have no time to learn about the United States 
before they come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most refugees, who are taught about life in the United States while they 
wait in refugee camps to get their visas for months and often years, those 
leaving Soviet Armenia often arrive in Los Angeles less than two weeks after 
they leave their homeland, U. S. State Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Their rapid relocation, while a blessing to the emigres and to their relatives 
here, means that they arrive in Los Angeles with few job skills and little idea 
of how to do things such as drive to work and pay rent, Ghazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are leaving their country so fast they have no time to understand what 
they're getting into," Ghazarian said. "They don't have time to take in the 
vast cultural changes they are about to make." 
</P>
<P>
The grant money is expected to be available to the relief groups by the end of 
November. But the acculturation program that it funds officially began 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the money received by the Armenian Relief Society under terms of 
the grant, the Armenian Evangelical Social Service Center in Hollywood will 
receive $385,000 and the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church, also in 
Hollywood, will receive $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the Armenian Relief Society, the money represents an opportunity to more 
than double the services that the organization provides, Ghazarian said. The 
$385,000 in federal funding is more than half as large as the Glendale 
chapter's budget this year -- about $500,000, Ghazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Relief Society officials have already transferred four social workers from the 
agency's other offices in the county to get the Glendale acculturation program 
off the ground, Ghazarian said. He said he also plans to hire four more social 
workers within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the emigres are forced into drastic career changes because of their 
lack of English language skills, and some Armenian women who were housewives in 
the Soviet Union enter the job market for the first time after settling in the 
United States, Ghazarian said. The result is a grab bag of problems that has 
been keeping the short-staffed service open late at night for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both exciting and also a challenge to provide the services that we know 
are needed," Ghazarian said. "All we can do now is do our best to help our 
clients and the agencies that serve them."

PASTOR ACCUSED OF MOLESTATIONS IS SUSPENDED BY CHURCH BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California conference of Seventh-day Adventist Churches suspended 
with pay a Glendale pastor accused of molesting three sisters in his 
congregation, an attorney for the church said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter H. Solis, 54, was arrested Friday and is charged with molesting three 
girls -- ages 7, 11 and 14 -- at his office in the Glendale Spanish Seventh-day 
Adventist Church on East Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
He was released on $7,500 bail the day of his arrest and is scheduled to be 
arraigned Dec. 12. Solis, who has denied the accusations, faces six felony 
charges of child molestation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor allegedly molested the children repeatedly between November, 1986, 
and June, court documents state. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Peterson, the church's lawyer, said Solis has been temporarily relieved 
of his church-related duties but will continue to receive his full salary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suspended him, but we are not prejudging the case," Peterson said. "As 
far as we can, we are trying to treat him as innocent until proven guilty, but 
we have to protect the ministry and the congregation." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victims are the daughters of the couple who served as the church's 
live-in janitors. The family lives in a house owned by the church that is 
adjacent to the worship hall, Police Investigator Lief Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
The family had been performing chores in exchange for rent for about four years 
and during that time the sisters worked closely with the pastor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolaisen said he learned of the alleged molestation four months ago from a 
doctor who said he discovered during a checkup that one of the girls had been 
molested. As required by law, the doctor reported the finding, Nicolaisen said. 
The doctor, who is member of the congregation, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks later, at least two newspapers -- The Times among them -- received an 
anonymous letter accusing Solis of molestation and the church of covering up 
his actions. Nicolaisen refuted the charges against the church. "The church has 
been extremely cooperative at all times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that when police informed the church of the investigation, Solis 
was reassigned to fund-raising duties outside his congregation, a position he 
occupied until his suspension. 
</P>
<P>
No further determination of Solis' status in the church -- or the future of the 
alleged victims' family -- will be made until the court decides the case, 
Peterson said. A substitute pastor has been called out of retirement to conduct 
services at the church, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Solis nor his attorney could be reached for comment, but Peterson said 
that after his arrest, the pastor asked the church board to be allowed 
immediately to preach again. "He understood the suspension, but was unhappy 
about it," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson added that despite the charges filed against Solis, "the church board 
and the vast majority of the congregation have been very supportive of Elder 
Solis and doubt very much the charges are true." 
</P>
<P>
He said Solis has been a pastor at the church for more than 20 years and 
enjoyed an excellent reputation as a preacher, fund-raiser and spiritual 
adviser. "The church board was very disappointed when I told them about the 
suspension," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three church members contacted by The Times, among the congregation's 500, said 
they did not believe the charges against Solis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pastor did anything wrong," said parishioner Alfa Soto. 
"He's been at the congregation for some time and he's always conducted himself 
correctly."

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE TO APPLY FOR HOUSING FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Housing Authority voted unanimously Tuesday to apply to thS. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development for funding for 20 additional units 
for lower-income households. 
</P>
<P>
The $156,000 grant would enable the city to increase its stock of Section 8 
federally subsidized housing from 697 to 717 units, said Madalyn Blake, 
director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
Blake told City Council members meeting as the Housing Authority that Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) informed her of the availability of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Section 8 program, tenants pay 30% of their monthly incomes toward 
rent and HUD pays the remainder of the fair market rental to the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
The council earmarked the $156,000 for six units for the elderly, 13 for small 
families and one for a large family. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has operated its Section 8 housing program since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
A memo from Blake to City Manager David Ramsay said the Section 8 office has 
more than 5,000 applications for housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the program, gross annual income for a single-person household 
must not exceed $13,950, and the annual income for a family of four may not 
exceed $19,950.

</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday authorized the city staff to start 
negotiations for the purchase of the Glendale Amtrak station from the Southern 
Pacific Co. as part of a future light-rail route. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David Ramsay said the council, meeting in closed session, 
identified the 2.5-acre property at 400 W. Cerritos Ave. as a key location in 
the city's transportation plans. Ramsay said the city is also interested in 
preserving the Spanish-style building as a historical site. 
</P>
<P>
The station is on Southern Pacific's main rail line to the San Fernando Valley 
and can be used for an alternative light-rail route to downtown Los Angeles, he 
said.

FLINTRIDGE PREP'S WIN ENDS EIGHT-YEAR DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Flintridge Prep football team ended eight years of frustration last week 
when the Rebels defeated Pasadena Poly, 27-6, in a Prep League game. 
</P>
<P>
Flintridge Prep, which usually features a pass-happy attack led by quarterback 
Chris Bisgaard and David Swayne, scored its first win over Pasadena Poly since 
1980 by rolling up 250 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Lyle Mays gained a game-high 127 yards in 14 carries while fullback 
David Park added 92 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
A Flintridge Prep win over Chadwick on Friday would guarantee the Rebels a spot 
in the Southern Section eight-man playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect season: Occidental's Laurie Schuster finished the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference cross-country season unbeaten, winning the 
5,000-meter SCIAC championship race in 18 minutes, 44 seconds last Saturday at 
La Mirada Park. 
</P>
<P>
Schuster, a junior, beat her nearest competitor by more than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The win qualified Schuster for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division 
III West Regionals at Santa Cruz on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental women's team, which was third overall in the SCIAC 
championships, tied Claremont and Pomona for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Getting his kicks: Former La Canada High punter Rob Myers is kicking up a storm 
for Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, 21, is averaging 44.8 yards a punt for the Cougars, which ranks the 
senior second in the Pacific-10 Conference and fourth nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Armed forces: Franklin High quarterback Santiago Alvarez continued his dream 
season last Friday, completing 26 of 36 passes for 361 yards and six touchdowns 
during the Panthers' 44-0 win over Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has completed 168 of 273 passes this season for 2,111 yards and 28 
touchdowns while throwing just six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing everything we could have asked of him," Franklin Coach Armando 
Gonzalez said. "There isn't a better passer in the City." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin (6-1 overall) has outscored opponents, 260-28. The Panthers are tied 
with Wilson for the Northern Conference lead with a 4-0 league record. 
</P>
<P>
Add Panther passers: Former Franklin High standout Ronnie Lopez has also been 
passing for big yardage since becoming the starter at Glendale College three 
games ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez completed 11 of 16 attempts for 238 yards and three touchdowns last 
Saturday during the Vaqueros' 62-26 rout of Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez has completed 45 of 83 passes for 809 yards and seven touchdowns this 
season. He has thrown three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
On the run: For the first time in school history, three Glendale College 
running backs each rushed for more than 100 yards in one game. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vaqueros' win over Harbor, tailback Sean Hampton had a game-high 146 
yards while tailback Doug Dragomer rushed for 110 yards and fullback Wes Bender 
added 103 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Tighten up: Glendale's victory over Harbor pleased Coach John Cicuto, but he 
had no defense for a defensive unit that surrendered 26 points to a team that 
had been shut out three times this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is struggling with peaks and valleys," Cicuto said. "They play 
hard, but mentally they break down and it kind of puts us into a bind. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't rely on our offense to score 40 or 50 points a game. It's just not 
going to happen against the good teams." 
</P>
<P>
A team, for example, like Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (4-2-1 overall, 3-1-1 in Western State Conference play) travels to 
Moorpark this Saturday for a game against the Raiders, who boast the top 
defense in the state. 
</P>
<P>
On the rebound: Unlike Glendale, Occidental had no problems with consistency 
last Saturday against Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers played poorly from start to finish in a 26-16 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything we weren't prepared for, we just didn't play very 
well," Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tackled terribly, probably the worst we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (5-2 overall, 3-1 in SCIAC play) meets Redlands (4-3, 4-0) at home 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental can guarantee itself a share of the SCIAC championship by defeating 
the Bulldogs.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE LETS JACKPOT POKER CONTINUE UNTIL TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a Los Angeles Superior Court ruling issued earlier this month and 
expanded this week, Los Angeles County card clubs can continue to offer jackpot 
poker, which the state attorney general's office has called a form of illegal 
lottery, until the issue is resolved at trial. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miriam A. Vogel, who issued a temporary injunction Oct. 2 preventing the 
Sheriff's Department and the attorney general's office from enforcing a ban 
against low ball jackpot poker, expanded the order to include seven-card stud, 
Texas hold 'em and straight high-draw poker. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Keith Borjon said the state is considering an appeal of the 
ruling.

PANEL MOVES TO SPEED UP PLAN FOR SYNCHRONIZED TRAFFIC SIGNALS IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to criticism leveled more than two months ago by a state 
assemblyman, the Los Angeles City Council's Transportation Committee agreed 
Wednesday to hire six more city staff members to speed up installation of 
synchronized traffic signals in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The additions, which will cost an estimated $193,000, must still be approved by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
More workers will hasten installation of the Automated Traffic Surveillance and 
Control program, scheduled for 382 Valley intersections, said John Fisher, 
principal city transportation engineer. The synchronized signals originally 
were scheduled for completion earlier this year, but instead will be done by 
February, 1992, said Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
In past months, city staff had estimated the program might not be complete 
until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who appeared before the council committee 
in mid-August to protest the delays, said Wednesday that he is not completely 
satisfied with the amended schedule. Katz was a key player in securing the $17 
million for the program from state, county and city sources. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better. I'm glad to see they're doing something," Katz said. "But I still 
don't understand why a system that was promised in 1989 will be ready in 1992. 
We're going to keep pushing on them to speed things up." 
</P>
<P>
The synchronization plan calls for installing computerized systems at 
intersections on and near Ventura and Victory boulevards. The so-called "smart 
intersections" provide information about number and spacing of vehicles, 
allowing lights at the next intersections to be timed for traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
Under a segment of the program paid for and installed by the state Department 
of Transportation, the Valley's first 51 smart intersections will begin 
operating along Ventura Boulevard next week, said Tom Conner, assistant general 
manager of the city Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Katz attended in August, city transportation officials explained 
that they were understaffed and overworked. They said synchronization of 
intersections in other areas of the city -- including Hollywood -- took 
precedence because private developers had paid for the work. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said private money should not give certain areas precedence and he 
suggested that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission might decide to 
withdraw its portion of the funding for the Valley program if the city did not 
move faster.

INCUMBENT'S PERFORMANCE GETS SPOTLIGHT IN ROLLING HILLS ESTATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In March, Rolling Hills Estates City Councilwoman Jacki McGuire was elected to 
fill out the unexpired term of veteran Councilman Jerome Belsky, who had been 
recalled the previous November in a bitter election. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as she seeks her first full four-year term in her own right in the Tuesday 
election, McGuire's performance in office is the major issue in the four-way 
race for two council seats. One seat is open because Mayor Nell Mirels -- who 
has been on the council since 1972 -- did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to McGuire, a 43-year-old special education teacher in the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, candidates include Hirsh V. Marantz, 
57, an electronics engineer; Susan Seamans, a 48-year-old interior designer, 
and Ken Servis, 50, a USC chemistry professor and dean, who also is a city 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Seamans and Servis contend that McGuire has been ineffective and disruptive and 
has refused to learn how to function as a councilwoman. "She has not listened 
and learned," Servis said. But Marantz admires McGuire, saying that she has 
been "trying to break through the good-old-boy system." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, McGuire said, "I've given the residents an active voice on the 
council, have stuck by the residents through thick and thin, despite the 
criticism and harassment." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the council race, the city ballot includes two propositions 
relating to a utility users tax to raise money for the purchase of public open 
space. Proposition N would create a four-year, 5% tax. A companion measure, 
Proposition O, would allow the city to exceed its so-called Gann limit on tax 
revenues for the duration of the tax. Both must be approved for the tax to be 
collected, and approval of the utility tax itself requires a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates believe that open space preservation is a key city 
concern, but they differ on how to do it. McGuire, Seamans and Marantz support 
the utility tax. Servis opposes the tax, contending it will raise too little to 
be effective and that land may be kept open through zoning or easements from 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
If McGuire is the leading issue in the council race, longevity of council 
service -- one bone of contention in the Belsky recall -- is a close second in 
the view of some candidates. Except for McGuire, the four current council 
members have shared the dais for more than a decade. Belsky served 12 years 
before being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the longtime incumbents are on Tuesday's ballot, most of the 
candidates expressed a belief that the city needs more turnover in its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in vital government," Seamans said. "If people stay too long, it 
gets tired." She said new leadership is needed, particularly in the areas of 
land use and open space preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Marantz said he advocates a two-term limit on council service and blamed what 
he termed unequal treatment of people by the council to officeholders becoming 
"entrenched." He contends that some people get approval of home modifications 
faster if they are supporters of a council member. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire also is continuing to advocate a two-term council limit, as she did in 
the special election. 
</P>
<P>
Both Seamans and Servis are banking on their name recognition and record of 
community service. Marantz is the self-admitted "underdog," saying he was 
prompted to run because of the longtime flap in his neighborhood over proposed 
expansion of the Peninsula Heritage School, which the council eventually turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Seamans was on the Palos Verdes Library District board from 1977 to 1985. 
Currently, she is president of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Coordinating Council. 
</P>
<P>
Servis, a planning commissioner for 11 years, said he has been effective in 
preserving the city's rural atmosphere. "I was instrumental in the neighborhood 
compatibility ordinance, which is the single most effective tool to protect the 
city," he said. That measure sets procedures to ensure that new homes fit into 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire argues that one of her strong suits has been making waves over 
conditional use permits, which she contends the city does not enforce quickly 
or stringently enough. For example, she has continually hammered at Chandler's 
Palos Verdes Sand &amp; Gravel Co. quarry to comply with noise and landscaping 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her council colleagues have accused her of being anti-business and 
trying to rush an established timetable for the work, but she has sided with 
nearby residents, who contend they have lived with Chandler noise for too long. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said residents "have to be watchdogs" in their own neighborhood, which 
should be the city's role. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of McGuire fault her on several counts, including her practice of 
abstaining on nearly all matters touching on the school district despite a city 
attorney's opinion that she has no conflict of interest as a district employee. 
(Mirels also is a school employee and does not abstain.) 
</P>
<P>
Seamans and Servis contend that by abstaining on such things as placing the 
utility tax on the ballot, McGuire is shirking her duty to participate in 
deciding critical issues. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said identification of the closed Dapplegray Intermediate School site 
as a possible future open space acquisition prompted her abstention. "I abstain 
on issues where city money is going to my employer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Servis also accused McGuire of knowingly conveying false information about a 
Chandler project to neighbors already unhappy with quarry operations. 
Specifically, he said, she took plans to the neighbors showing that light 
standards for a proposed golf driving range were 40 feet tall when she knew the 
Planning Commission had reduced them to 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said she took plans to the neighbors that showed the lights at 20 feet, 
and that she told them the commission had lowered them. Subsequently, residents 
made it clear they wanted no lights at all, and the golf range was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire sees that kind of activity as typical of the way she performs as a 
council member. 
</P>
<P>
"I become an active voice to inform (residents) of what is going on. They come 
up with their goals. I gather information for them and try to organize them so 
they can reach their goal," she said.

L.A. PRESSURED TO OK EXPANSION OF SUNSHINE LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
DUMPS: THE COUNTY WANTS LOS ANGELES TO JOIN IT IN EXPANDING THE SUNSHINE CANYON 
DUMP. IN RETURN, THE CITY WOULD GAIN ACCESS TO THE COUNTY'S PROPOSED ELSMERE 
CANYON DUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County officials are pushing the city to approve expansion of the 
Sunshine Canyon landfill above Granada Hills as a price for granting city trash 
trucks access to the proposed new Elsmere Canyon garbage dump near Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
A draft "memorandum of cooperation" submitted to the city by the county earlier 
this week also threatens to block the city from using the county portion of 
Sunshine Canyon if city officials do not allow the landfill to expand onto 
adjacent land within city limits. Sunshine Canyon straddles the city-county 
line, but the only area where dumping is permitted at present is in the city. 
</P>
<P>
County negotiator Robert K. Tanenbaum said Wednesday that county officials 
regard allowing expansion of the Granada Hills dump -- onto additional land in 
both the city and county -- as a critical issue in the negotiations to create a 
county and city dump at Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is come up with an integrated waste management plan 
for the residents of the county going out at least 50 years," Tanenbaum said. 
He said expanding the Sunshine landfill is vital to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Granada Hills, called the county 
proposal totally unacceptable and said the City Council may have to have an 
"eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation" with county supervisors to sort out the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Edwards, a Granada Hills resident who is an officer with the North Valley 
Coalition, a group that has led opposition to expansion of the Sunshine dump, 
accused the county of playing "nonsensical hardball." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said it was "an obscenity" for officials to push for an Elsmere Canyon 
landfill so near Granada Hills while seeking to increase dumping at Sunshine 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the most impacted community for both these landfills," she said. "It's 
just beyond belief that they would even think of doing that to one community." 
</P>
<P>
City negotiators, meanwhile, said the county memorandum of cooperation -- the 
latest twist in convoluted land-swap negotiations involving local, state, 
federal and private interests -- has been altered since it was given to them on 
Tuesday. They declined to detail what changes had been made but acknowledged 
that Sunshine Canyon's future remains a major sticking point in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire thing is bogus," said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, referring to the 
county's proposed memorandum of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the city wanted to promise Browning-Ferris Industries -- the firm that 
owns and operates Sunshine Canyon -- support for future expansion, questions 
remain about whether such a promise would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can legally encumber a future council action," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is responsible for Sunshine Canyon in two ways: It oversees planning 
and land use changes at the dump through the routine city planning hearing 
processes, and the city Bureau of Sanitation polices the dump as the local 
agent for the state Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Despite bitter objections from nearby Granada Hills residents, Browning-Ferris 
Industries is asking the county to change its general plan to allow a 542-acre 
expansion of the Sunshine Canyon dump. That land is next to land within the 
city limits now used for dumping. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed expansion, the subject of a public hearing today at John F. 
Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, would accommodate about 70 million tons 
of refuse over a 20- to 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
If dumping were simultaneously allowed to increase on the city side, it would 
increase the capacity on the county's side to 80 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
Public attention has been focused on the city's dwindling landfill capacity 
since earlier this year, when the state tried to scale back dumping at Lopez 
Canyon Landfill near Lake View Terrace, the only city-owned dump site. 
</P>
<P>
Elsmere Canyon, with an estimated capacity of 190 million tons, is seen by city 
and county officials as the simplest and quickest solution to the problem. City 
and county sanitation officials have said Elsmere could handle the region's 
trash for 30 to 50 years, if it is eventually granted an operating permit by 
the state Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
But making that proposal reality is no easy feat because so many interests are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
For example, most of the 1,494-acre parcel being viewed as a potential landfill 
site in Elsmere Canyon is owned by the U.S. Forest Service. The city and county 
hope to acquire the property by trading other lands the Forest Service would 
like to add to its Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, there has been a flurry of activity on the land-swap 
proposal, which was initiated last February in legislation written by Rep. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, in a bid to have environmental 
interests play a larger role in negotiations, made an independent pact with BKK 
Corp., the waste management firm that has rights to some of the land near 
Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that pact called for BKK to turn Elsmere Canyon over to the conservancy 
to prevent the county from using its eminent domain powers to acquire it. In 
return, BKK vowed to help the conservancy gain three canyons in the Santa 
Monica Mountains as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
But the pact between the conservancy and BKK fell apart last Thursday when the 
county and BKK reached a separate agreement. Under the new tentative agreement 
between BKK and the county, the county will pay BKK $125 million for its land 
interests and will reimburse some expenses after the company obtains the 
permits it needs for the Elsmere dump. 
</P>
<P>
That tentative agreement, presented to individual supervisors Wednesday, must 
be ratified by the Board of Supervisors before it becomes official.

CLASSROOM SPACE DEBATED IN HERMOSA SCHOOLS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where once the Hermosa Beach City School District grappled with the problem of 
declining enrollment, the school board now faces the reverse dilemma: 
Enrollment in the one-school district is on the rise, and the district needs 
more classroom space. 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates -- two incumbents and two challengers -- are seeking three open 
board seats in Tuesday's election. The candidates agree that finding more room 
is the most urgent problem facing the district, closely followed by the 
question of whether to unify with other school districts in the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
The district's 725 kindergarten through eighth-grade students all attend 
Hermosa Valley School and after graduation go to Redondo Union High School. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, because of declining enrollment, the district closed two schools -- 
both of which are now leased -- and consolidated students at Hermosa Valley. As 
enrollment increased last year, however, the district set up a portable 
building with two classrooms to ease a space shortage. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Hermosa's rise in enrollment was gradual, from 645 students in 1985 
to 666 in 1987, district officials said. But by 1989 enrollment had increased 
by another 59 students to 725. 
</P>
<P>
One possible solution to the space shortage is a proposal to purchase the 
Multivision Cable site adjacent to the school for expansion, the candidates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are three years remaining on leases for the two sites closed in '86. Both 
sites are too large for current needs, school officials said, although terms of 
one lease would allow the district to take over the site if needed. A third 
property, the former South School site, has only four classrooms and is too far 
from Hermosa Valley to be used effectively, board members said. Part of the 
South School site was sold for development several years ago and most of the 
school facilities were demolished then. 
</P>
<P>
The board has not taken a position on the unification issue, but has joined 
with the school boards from Manhattan Beach and the South Bay Union High School 
District in hiring a consultant to study eight different unification 
configurations. Among the possibilities are organizing districts along city 
lines and combining the three elementary districts and the high school district 
into one. The consultant's report is due in January. 
</P>
<P>
The board meets monthly and members are paid $35 per meeting. Board member 
Georgia Tattu is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the four candidates and their views on the issues: 
</P>
<P>
Bill Druar, 46, an electronics technician and businessman, is a 19-year 
resident of the city. Druar has a son who attends Hermosa Valley School. 
</P>
<P>
Druar said he is opposed to unification and that, despite efforts to study 
whether some form of unification is viable, he said he is unlikely to change 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we would lose control of our local school," Druar said. "We would 
be unified with a larger district which would have a stronger voice on the 
board and they would control the board. . . . I don't think they're going to be 
able to come up with a unification plan I would like." 
</P>
<P>
Although voters passed an initiative in 1984 preserving surplus school property 
as open space, Druar said he would like to see the city allow some development 
in addition to park use on the South School site, whose sale to the city is 
under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
If a portion of the property is rezoned for development, Druar said, it could 
generate more money for the district to help finance construction of a gym and 
buy the Multivision property for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
* Incumbent Lynne Gonzales, 42, is seeking her second full term on the board. 
She was first elected to the board in 1984 to fill an unexpired term of a 
member who was elected to the City Council. A private school secretary, 
Gonzales has three children who graduated from Hermosa schools. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales strongly favors unification of the four beach city school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"The districts should all be unified rather than in pieces," Gonzales said. "I 
feel that total unification is the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said she would not object to keeping the district as it is, but argued 
that unification could help bring in more revenue and enable the district to 
add educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would advocate having a guaranteed Hermosa Beach position on a 
unified school board to ensure that Hermosa Beach -- the smallest of the four 
districts -- would have a voice in running a unified district. She said she 
would consider running for such a position. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales is opposed to selling any portion of the South School site or other 
surplus school property for development. "That's why I ran in the beginning, 
and that's why I'm running now," she said. "I feel the city is already dense 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
* Gregory J. Kelsey, 44, a 17-year resident of Hermosa Beach, is a commercial 
mortgage banker whose daughter is a fourth-grade student at Hermosa Valley 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey said he is opposed to unification. "I really don't want to see a true 
unification," he said. "I want (the schools) to maintain individual control." 
Instead, he advocates consolidation of janitorial, maintenance and other 
services among the school districts as a cost-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey said he would use his financial background to help the district get the 
most from its excess school sites. He said he is opposed to selling surplus 
sites, and that the district might better benefit by holding onto valuable land 
and leasing it, as it already does at two sites. 
</P>
<P>
"The school board has a fiduciary responsibility to provide as much income as 
possible to the schools," Kelsey said. "Our whole job is to make sure kids get 
the best education possible." 
</P>
<P>
* Incumbent Mary Lou Weiss, 51, is seeking her second term on the board. Weiss 
has one child who graduated from district schools and another who is in eighth 
grade at Hermosa Valley. A longtime school activist, she is a former president 
of the North School Parent Teacher Organization and chairwoman of the school's 
Art at Your Fingertips volunteer art education program. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said she and the board are waiting for the consultant's study before 
taking a formal position on unification. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have an unbiased opinion," she said, adding that if the board "had 
our choice, we would prefer it to stay as it is . . . and we would like to 
petition legislators to be able to send students to either Mira Costa or 
Redondo Union High School." 
</P>
<P>
Some families live closer to Mira Costa than to Redondo Union and would prefer 
having the option of sending their children to the closer school, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said whether the district has the funds to buy the Multivision property 
to help solve the overcrowding problem could depend on the outcome of 
negotiations with the city on the sale of the South School site. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we are successful with the negotiations with the city, we would not 
have the money," Weiss said. 
</P>

STRICT PARKING FOR LEASED COURTS PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Worried that county plans to lease outside court space would create a parking 
morass, Torrance City Council members Tuesday passed strict new parking 
requirements for any private building converted to courthouse use. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the building must have one parking spot for every 150 square 
feet of space. The city also retains the right to alter the standard on a 
site-by-site basis. 
</P>
<P>
One building owner charged that the emergency ordinance, approved unanimously 
by the council and effective immediately, is a direct attack on his 
negotiations with the county. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Conrow, developer of the Park Beyond the Park on Crenshaw Boulevard next 
to Wilson Park, said he has spent the last few months negotiating a courthouse 
lease of his 128,000-square-foot office building. 
</P>
<P>
Court administrators acknowledge they plan to sign a lease in the next few 
weeks either for Conrow's building or one other -- an empty warehouse east of 
the Civic Center on California Street near Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Conrow said his building is the only facility in the city that meets the size, 
structure and power codes required by the county. He also said his building's 
584 parking spaces are enough to suit court needs. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they are not trying to persecute Conrow. They said the law 
is intended to avoid duplicating the parking problems that currently plague the 
Torrance courthouse. The 538 spaces are frequently full, forcing drivers to use 
other Civic Center parking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to live with the problem day in and day out here in the Civic Center," 
Councilman Bill Applegate said. "We don't want to inflict the same problems on 
any other area."

L.A. COUNTY CLUBS AVOID STATE'S NEW CRACKDOWN ON JACKPOT POKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office and local law authorities said Wednesday 
they are ready to begin enforcement of a ban on jackpot poker at more than 300 
clubs statewide, but the ban will not be in effect in Los Angeles County 
because of a Superior Court ruling issued earlier this month and expanded 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling by Judge Miriam A. Vogel, Los Angeles County card clubs may 
continue to offer jackpot poker, which Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has 
called a form of illegal lottery, until the issue is resolved at trial. 
</P>
<P>
In jackpot poker, players compete for two pots -- one that accumulates over 
days or weeks and a regular pot that is won on each deal. The jackpot grows 
until it is won by a player with a specific hand that varies depending on the 
game being played. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel issued a temporary injunction Oct. 2 preventing the Sheriff's Department 
and the attorney general's office from enforcing a ban on low-ball jackpot 
poker in Los Angeles County, but said she would need more time to decide 
whether the injunction should extend to other forms of poker when played in 
connection with a jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Vogel expanded the injunction to include seven-card stud, Texas hold 
'em and straight high-draw poker. 
</P>
<P>
The question of the legality of jackpot poker became an issue in August, when 
the attorney general issued an opinion that the game is an illegal lottery 
because players must pay to play, and because it involves a prize that is won 
in a game where chance predominates over skill. 
</P>
<P>
Four Los Angeles-area card clubs sued to block the proposed ban and won a 
temporary injunction preventing its enforcement in the county. The four clubs 
are the Eldorado Club and the Normandie Casino in Gardena, the Bell Gardens 
Bicycle Club and the California Commerce Casino in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the preliminary injunction is lifted, we are at liberty to continue to 
play the games," said Richard Dear, an attorney for the two Gardena clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Keith Borjon, who represented the state Department of Justice 
and the attorney general's office in Monday's hearing, said the state is 
considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Pope, an attorney for the Bicycle Club and Commerce Casino, said club 
owners are hoping the issue will be decided in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The orderly thing to do is to call off the dogs and not attack jackpot poker, 
set this for an early trial, try it, and whoever loses can decide whether to 
appeal," Pope said. "The disorderly thing is to let all . . . clubs around the 
state thrash around and each one have to wrestle with local law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Broderick, manager of the state gaming registration program in Sacramento, 
said state officials are standing firm on the Wednesday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving full steam ahead as far as enforcing the cease-and-desist order 
in other counties," Broderick said. "We will be sending out special agent 
personnel to check on clubs to see if they have followed our request." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing was scheduled this week in Alameda County on a case involving a card 
club there that also challenged the ban, but that hearing may be delayed 
because of logistics problems stemming from the Northern California earthquake, 
Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sarakbi, president of the California Card Club Owners Assn. and general 
manager of the Commerce Casino, said the association was hoping to reach an 
agreement with state officials to prevent enforcement of the ban statewide 
until the legality of the game is decided at trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been bombarded with telephone calls from small clubs across the state 
asking what are we going to do," Sarakbi said. "My advice has been to do 
whatever the attorney general's office requires you to do. . . . I'm trying to 
work out a peaceful solution (where) the status quo would apply throughout the 
state until the courts decide."

P.V. SCHOOL OFFICIAL SAYS 'DIRTY POLITICS' SPARKED COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes school board member Marlys Kinnel has labeled "dirty politics" a 
conflict-of-interest complaint about her vote to ratify a $274,500 exemption 
from developer fees for a part-owner of the mall where she does promotion work. 
</P>
<P>
Information from the complaint -- filed with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission two weeks ago -- has been widely circulated by opponents of Kinnel, 
who is running for reelection to the Palos Verdes Unified School District board 
on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It may cost me the election," Kinnel said last week. "That would be a real 
tragedy for the district." 
</P>
<P>
The school board's unanimous vote -- in June, 1988 -- was a retroactive 
ratification of exemptions from the school district's development fee, which 
already had been granted by the district staff. The largest exemption went to 
the Wallace Ranch development in Rancho Palos Verdes, which was being developed 
by Ron Florance. Kinnel works for the firm that manages The Shops at Palos 
Verdes; Florance is part-owner of the mall in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Florance nor Kinnel could be reached for comment the week the complaint 
was filed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Florance said the accusation that Kinnel had a 
conflict of interest in connection with the exemption is "a blatant 
misrepresentation of the facts" and is "strictly politically motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Florance added that he never spoke with Kinnel about the exemption and that he 
had nothing to do with hiring Kinnel to work as "community representative" for 
a firm that manages the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnel said the "bottom line" is that the complaint against her is a stale 
accusation voiced by "angry people." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by Rolling Hills Estates resident Joanne Petow, a 
supporter of east-side candidates Barry Hildebrand, Marianne Kipper and Peter 
Gardiner. 
</P>
<P>
Petow acknowledged that the complaint was based on information provided by Jan 
McAuley, a Palos Verdes Estates resident who is suing school board members 
alleging waste in the sale of school property and favoritism in the granting of 
exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, Florance sought to exempt his 80-home Wallace Ranch 
development from the district's $1.50-a-square-foot developer fees, which took 
effect in June, 1987. On April 29, 1988, David Capelouto, assistant 
superintendent for business, granted the exemption for $274,500. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, the school board unanimously approved the retroactive policy for 
developers who could show that they would have begun building ahead of the 
deadline but had been delayed because of events beyond their control. The 
policy had the effect of ratifying the Wallace Ranch exemption. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Kinnel voted for the policy, she was working for Hahn Property 
Management Corp., which manages The Shops at Palos Verdes. The complaint says 
Kinnel was hired in June, 1987, when Florance was planning the Wallace Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnel said in a March 16 deposition, cited in the complaint, that Florance 
participated as partner in the Hahn Property Management Corp. However, she 
added in the deposition that she had never spoken with him about the exemption 
or any other business matter. At a school board meeting Oct. 16, Kinnel said 
Florance "is not my boss." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Kinnel acknowledged knowing that Florance was an ownership 
partner in The Shops at Palos Verdes but said that she was hired without his 
intervention and that he had nothing to do with running the mall. 
</P>
<P>
She said she knew "in passing" that "Ron Florance received an exemption" at the 
time of her vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Big deal," she said. ". . . Because there was no association with my job, 
there was no possible conflict of interest. . . . When that came to the board 
-- that we were to pass a resolution -- for me to have abstained would have 
said to the community that there was an association" with Florance. 
</P>
<P>
Florance also said he is not involved in management of The Shops at Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to do with the management of that center," Florance said. "I am 
a partner in name only. I have no authority as to the hiring or firing of 
people. I had nothing to do with the hiring of Marlys Kinnel. They didn't talk 
to me about it."

Helen Fladwed has lived in a list of towns that sounds like a conductor's "all 
aboard": Deadwood, Des Moines, Hollywood, Burbank, Chatsworth. The biggest 
challenge was getting from Iowa to California. Once in Los Angeles, Fladwed has 
been a coloratura soprano, wife and mother of two children, church volunteer, 
president of a PTA and a reluctant helper on the family chicken ranch. Fladwed, 
84, lives in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 I was born in Deadwood, S.D., and my parents brought me to Des Moines when I 
was about 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
I came to California in 1927. My mother for many years had talked about coming 
to California; all Iowans wanted to come to California. It was the place where 
there didn't seem to be any prejudice. There was spiritual freedom. It was more 
liberated socially. My husband and I moved in with my mother until we could get 
all the money together to make the trip. I was 22. My father came on ahead in 
'26, to get a job and place for us to live, so he was here. 
</P>
<P>
We started out on the 5th of August in the heat of the day. We got here on the 
27th. We had 22 days of problems. 
</P>
<P>
None of us ever drove a car before. I'm talking about greenhorns, greeeenhorns! 
My mother bought a Case car, which was as big as these new Toyota vans. It was 
a second-hand car, six-passenger, eight-cylinder, all good tires, but the 
salesman didn't say that there's a difference between city driving and gravel 
driving. We began having all kinds of problems with the tires. In those days it 
was tube tires. So my brother and my husband, Jacob, were constantly patching. 
The tubes got to be very much crazy quilts of patches. 
</P>
<P>
We got to Demming, N.M., and we had to stay over three days while they got a 
part for the car. The engine had gone wrong. We had to sleep outdoors because 
there was just a garage and a grocery store, that's all. We had to wash in cold 
water, and there was the smell of gasoline. A lot of oil wells had come in. The 
gas smell was prevalent all over -- miles and miles into nowhere and you could 
still smell it. 
</P>
<P>
When we left Demming, we started out across this high desert. Our little fox 
terrier jumped out of the car before we realized it, and he ran wildly toward a 
herd of cattle, barking his head off. The cattle started to walk toward him. 
Mama says, "Stay right where you are now," because we had read that wild cattle 
will attack anybody that's on foot. And, of course, we were the only car. We 
were, all of this time, one lonesome car out there in that high desert. We were 
so green. 
</P>
<P>
We sat in the car, and it began to get dark, and there was thunder and 
lightning, and we had the car windows open. Mom says, "Sit still, sit still. 
Don't move." And the lightning was playing all around the car, inside the car 
and out. By that time, the cattle had moved all around us. And lightning is 
attracted to the horns of cattle. There were actually lightning balls. It was a 
tremendous experience. 
</P>
<P>
I never saw mama look at a map. I never saw a map, so I didn't know where we 
were going. We were just going by guess and by golly, heading west. 
</P>
<P>
Then we came to Yuma, Arizona. That was a big enough town to have an oil 
station, and they were having a grasshopper plague. You had to cover your face 
before you got a grasshopper in your mouth, it was that bad. And it was hot. We 
got some gasoline, and we were just praying that we'd get into California 
without anything more happening. 
</P>
<P>
We finally got to Indio, and then that little old car just heaved a sigh of 
relief and says, "Well, I gotcha here. I'm done." And all the tires went down 
and we were stranded. They just went flat. 
</P>
<P>
I had started to California in style, wearing a beautiful purple taffeta dress 
and hat made to my specifications by a friend. By the time we got to Dennison, 
Tex., I was feeling the heat, so I discarded the purple taffeta outfit and went 
to the store and I bought man's bib overalls that farmers wear. I made my debut 
in California in man's overalls.

HARDEMAN SPARS WITH 2 COLLEAGUES, SEES 2 INITIATIVES DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood Councilman Garland Hardeman, who pledged during his recent campaign 
to bring new life to the City Council, saw two of his initiatives shot down 
Tuesday after spirited exchanges with two political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edward Vincent refused to appoint four commissioners nominated by 
Hardeman, prompting the new councilman to complain that he has a right to 
appoint commissioners in his council district. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Vincent said that one of the nominees, Terry Coleman, is too 
critical of the city and that the others were proposed only to replace 
nominations made by former Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas, whom Hardeman 
defeated Oct. 3 after a bitter two-year legal and electoral battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The city commissions are set up to help the city, not for people's private 
political needs," Vincent said. "Hardeman's been on the council for two 
meetings. How does he know how the current commissioners function?" 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman also clashed with Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, a former Hardeman 
ally who has since become a fierce political opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan teamed up with Vincent and Councilman Jose Fernandez to defeat a 
Hardeman proposal to change the time of council meetings from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman, whose measure was supported by Councilman Daniel Tabor, said the 
change was aimed at drawing more people to meetings, but Scardenzan and the 
mayor said the measure was a personal move to accommodate Hardeman's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he did not support the time change Tuesday to give council 
members more time to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In another clash, Scardenzan questioned whether the city should pay for the 
refreshments served during a reception held in City Hall two weeks ago, before 
Hardeman was sworn into office. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman responded with a personal jab at Scardenzan, who had said during the 
campaign that he would resign his own council seat if Hardeman was elected. 
</P>
<P>
"Scardenzan said if I was elected he would resign. . . . I see that he has not 
honored what he said he would do," Hardeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan said after the meeting that he had decided to stay on the council 
because he received telephone calls from supporters urging him not to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Although Scardenzan has vowed not to speak to Hardeman, both men said in 
interviews that they do not think their conflict will interfere with city 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who fought to keep Hardeman from winning a council seat, said he sees 
himself in a new role of peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be dissension, but neither Garland nor Tony will stop the 
progress in this city," he said.

THOMAS FINED FOR FLOUTING COURT WITH FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marc Lacey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge has fined Ervin (Tony) Thomas $500 for violating a court 
order that banned him from portraying himself as an incumbent during his 
unsuccessful City Council campaign against Garland Hardeman. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman, who defeated Thomas last month and now sits on the council, said the 
ruling "caps Thomas' political career." 
</P>
<P>
The contempt of court ruling Monday comes after two years of political and 
legal battles between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas edged Hardeman out when they first met in a June, 1987, council 
election, but a Superior Court annulled Thomas' victory, ordering a new 
election after finding violations by Thomas' campaign workers in the absentee 
balloting. Thomas appealed the decision, remaining on the council during the 
two years of court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled in August that because Thomas' 1987 
victory was annulled, he could not refer to himself as an incumbent councilman 
during the campaign. The judge ruled that Thomas campaign brochures showing 
Thomas sitting in the council chambers and referring to his time on the council 
violated her order. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas called the fine "a bit harsh" and said the ruling had limited his 
freedom of expression. Calling the two-year legal fight "an agony," he said it 
has left him in "deep financial debt." 
</P>
<P>
The law firm that represented Hardeman without charge is seeking payment from 
Thomas and the city of its approximately $230,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council discussed the fees in executive session Tuesday, but declined 
comment on the result. Hardeman did not attend that session. Marc Lacey

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 32 YEARS TO LIFE IN OFFICER'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A participant in a 1988 armed robbery in which an Inglewood police officer was 
slain was sentenced Tuesday in Torrance Superior Court to 32 years to life in 
state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Joevone Elster, 24, described by prosecutors as the mastermind of a bungled gas 
station holdup, was one of three men and a youth convicted of murder and armed 
robbery for the crime. Police say the fifth participant, who shot Sgt. George 
Aguilar during the getaway, committed suicide after a 45-mile chase the night 
of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, a 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, is 
the only Inglewood police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in the 
department's 81-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Still facing sentencing by Judge John P. Shook are Van Otis Wilson, convicted 
of first-degree murder, and Patrick Anthony Carr, convicted of second-degree 
murder. A 15-year-old defendant was sentenced to the California Youth Authority 
until he is 25.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VALENCIA MAN ARRESTED IN PORNOGRAPHY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Valencia man was arrested Wednesday on charges stemming from the seizure last 
month of more than 30 child-pornography videotapes and a computer for 
cataloguing his porn collection, the Los Angeles city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall L. Holding, 42, was taken into custody at his Glendale office and was 
being held at the Los Angeles Police Department's Parker Center Jail, said Mike 
Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Holding was charged Tuesday with one count of exhibiting pornography involving 
a minor to a person over 18 years old and one count of exchanging a photograph 
in which a person under the age of 14 is depicted engaging in sexual conduct. 
Holding could be jailed for up to one year and fined as much as $2,000 on each 
count, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
Holding, a consultant who finds inexpensive moving companies for clients, was 
arrested once before on Oct. 6 after he showed child-pornography magazines to 
an undercover detective, to whom he also made statements about fondling his 
6-year-old stepdaughter, said Deputy City Atty. Tracy Webb. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his initial arrest, Holding was freed from jail when his wife 
posted $5,000 bail, Qualls said. He is awaiting arraignment on a charge of 
annoying a child in that case, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
While searching Holding's house Oct. 6, investigators also seized several 
videocassette recorders, televisions and a video camera, Qualls said. That 
search led to Holding's arrest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation started in September after detectives received a tip about 
Holding's interest in child pornography, Qualls said.

CONTRACT LOW ON LIST FOR DAVIS; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: WITH HIS FATHER DYING OF CANCER, HE HAS MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY 
ABOUT THAN WHERE HE'LL PITCH NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His voice started quivering. He stopped. He opened his mouth to speak again, 
but as hard as he tried, no words would come out. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly four months, Mark Davis has kept this dark, grim secret to himself. 
His Padre teammates had no clue. His manager, Jack McKeon, never knew. Not even 
his best friends were told. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want people feeling sorry for me," said Davis, the Padres' star 
relief pitcher. "I knew if it ever came out during the season, everyone would 
be consoling me and asking me about it. And I just didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
But now, with reporters, agents and attorneys telephoning his house at all 
hours since Monday night, when he filed for free agency, Davis has asked to 
have his privacy respected. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he wants to trivialize the importance of where he will play next 
season, but at this particular time, Davis could care less if he throws another 
pitch the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
You see, his father is dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
And after months of praying and hoping that these new experimental treatments 
would cure him, Davis has succumbed to reality. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, I refused to believe it," Davis said, his voice cracking, 
"but now I know he's going to die." 
</P>
<P>
The tumor in Kenneth Davis was originally discovered three years ago. It was 
diagnosed as prostate cancer. The family was told not to be alarmed, and after 
radiation treatments kept the tumor from increasing, the Davis household was 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We always kept a positive outlook, believing it would go away," Davis said. 
"My mother is deeply religious, and I think we all had faith everything would 
be all right." 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this year, the cancer began spreading. It raced through his thighs, 
chest and finally to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark and I really didn't know how bad it was," said Candy Davis, Mark's wife, 
"because they really downplayed it. When we saw him in April, he looked good, 
sounded good and felt good. When he had his bad days, they always told us he 
had a cold, or he had the flu, or something else like that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they didn't want Mark to know; they wanted to spare him." 
</P>
<P>
Davis indeed pitched as if he didn't have a care in the world. He recorded a 
save in each of his first 11 appearances and had 22 saves by the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
When he was informed in July that he was selected to the National League 
All-Star team by Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda, he immediately was on the phone 
to his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make the All-Star team more than anything I've ever wanted," Davis 
said, "because I knew it might be the last time my dad would ever see me pitch 
in one. Since the All-Star Game was in Anaheim, and my folks live in 
Sacramento, I thought my dad would feel strong enough to make it." 
</P>
<P>
But it was at the All-Star Game that Davis learned just how ill his father had 
become. He had lost 25 pounds since Mark had last seen him in April, and the 
cancer had stripped away most of his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him a day before the All-Star Game," Candy Davis said, "and I couldn't 
believe it. I was shocked. He had gone so far downhill in just two months. I 
really didn't know if he could even make it to the game." 
</P>
<P>
With the All-Star workout during the day on Monday and festivities at night, 
Mark never had the opportunity to see his father until Tuesday after the game. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Candy had been able to prepare him for the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Mark, your dad's been sick lately,' "Candy said, " 'he's lost a lot 
of weight. He's very weak.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis, 63, was so weak, in fact, that he nearly missed the chance to 
see his son pitch. He was taken to a first-aid station after the first inning 
and laid on a cot for several innings until he regained his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the excitement, the heat and everything just got to him," Candy Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis, ignoring the advice of the nurses and first-aid attendants, 
refused to be detoured now. He did not travel nine hours to listen on the radio 
as his son pitched in an All-Star Game. If Mark was going to be pitching, he 
was going to be right there watching him. 
</P>
<P>
When Mark entered the game in the sixth, there Kenneth Davis was, sitting on 
the edge of his seat. There could not have been a prouder papa, either, when 
Mark pitched a one-two-three inning, climaxed with his strike out of Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, to this day, he still talks about the time Mark struck out Bo 
Jackson," Candy Davis said. "It just thrilled him so much." 
</P>
<P>
When Mark saw his father after the game, and the deterioration that the cancer 
has caused, his eyes watered but he kept from crying. It wasn't until later, 
after he was alone with his wife, that he broke down. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I never had anyone close to me die before," Davis said. "I had a 
grandmother who died when I was young, but I really didn't know her too well. I 
think she was 94 or 96. 
</P>
<P>
"But my dad, he's only 63. He hasn't had a chance to see my daughters (ages 3 
years and 7 months) grow up, develop their own personalities. It just doesn't 
seem fair." 
</P>
<P>
The original plan this off-season, Davis said, was to spend as much time as 
possible with his father, allowing his daughters time to know their grandfather 
before he no longer is around. 
</P>
<P>
Last week changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis was admitted to intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
Mark took the first flight to Sacramento, and stayed with his father until 
Tuesday morning. He took a flight to Phoenix, Ariz., to be with his kids for 
Halloween and plans to return to Sacramento today to be with his father for the 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I even saw one inning of these last two games of the World 
Series," Davis said, "it's just been so hectic. The whole family was there, and 
I spent a lot of nights with my dad in the hospital. There's so much to do now, 
a lot of business that needs to be taken care of. I've got to . . . " 
</P>
<P>
His voice broke off. 
</P>
<P>
All of the baseball experience in the world doesn't teach you how to prepare 
for death. There's no one to tell you how to go about making funeral 
arrangements, and no remedy to ease the pain of watching precious life seeping 
out of someone while tears stream down your face. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the hardest part," Candy Davis said. "We all know it's inevitable now." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis was given permission to go home Wednesday. A hospital bed will be 
awaiting. The family will be by his side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through," Mark said. "All of the 
pain my father is going through right now, I just wish I could take some of it 
away from him." 
</P>
<P>
During the season, it seemed so easy. All Kenneth Davis asked from his son was 
for him to ignore his illness and be the best relief pitcher in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mark did just that, obtaining a major-league 44 saves while winning the Rolaids 
Relief Man of the Year award. In a couple of weeks, he'll learn if he'll have a 
Cy Young Award to go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very hard time for Mark," Candy Davis said, "because he was 
constantly worrying about his dad. But it was like the game was an outlet for 
him. When he crossed that white line, he was able to concentrate on baseball 
and forget for a little while about the other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, of course, no one's thinking about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Davis apologizes to the Padres and their fans, who are anxiously waiting for 
him to decide with whom he'll sign his next contract. But they'll have to wait 
a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the people of San Diego understand," Davis said, "but I'm really not in 
the mood to think about that stuff right now. I'd like to see something worked 
out between us and the Padres, but there's a lot of things that will enter my 
decision. Money definitely will not be the deciding factor, and I've always 
considered that the Padre fans were the greatest I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time, and maybe only time, I'll ever be a free agent. I just 
want to be able to explore all my options and see what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that right now, I don't have time to think about it. It's just not 
that important to me right now. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is my father. I want to be there for my father. Please, I 
hope everybody can understand that."

OCEAN VIEW CATCHES WAVE OF SUCCESS TO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Isom, Ocean View High School football coach, is not quite used to the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every time I open my mouth I get quoted now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's because Isom, in his first year as a head coach, has led Ocean 
View (6-2 overall, 3-0 in the Sunset League) to its first playoff berth since 
the school opened in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
That berth was guaranteed when the Seahawks defeated Huntington Beach, 21-7, 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, in sole possession of first place, will go for further 
accomplishments as it meets Edison (5-3, 2-1) at 7:30 tonight at Westminster 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would ensure Ocean View at least a part of the Sunset League title, 
something the Seahawks have never won in football. Ocean View plays Marina 
(2-6, 0-3) in its final league game next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Isom, an assistant at Ocean View for four years before becoming head coach, 
said his team's success has snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
"Each game becomes bigger and bigger," he said. "But this one should be a 
barn-burner." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Randy Karliner leads the Seahawk offense. Only a junior, Karliner, 
a two-year starter, has passed for 1,082 yards and 13 touchdowns with six 
interceptions. Quincy Bennett is the team's leading rusher with 467 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Ocean View is strong, particularly in the secondary. Sean Rogers 
and Andrew Wind both have five interceptions, Scott Caringella has four and 
Jason Merkel two. And although defensive end/offensive guard Greg Johnston is 
only 5-foot-6, he had a sack and knocked down three passes last week -- 
including one he intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
"The team has really come together; they've jelled as a unit," said Isom, who 
previously coached at Westminster and Huntington Beach. "They (the offense and 
defense) just seem to feed off each other." 
</P>
<P>
Against Edison, Ocean View will face two talented players in quarterback Donnie 
Smith, who has passed for 1,229 yards and nine touchdowns and has a 64.4 
completion percentage, and running back Shane Sherman, who has rushed for 1,154 
yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, perhaps, is the fact that Edison has some strong 
motivations of its own tonight. A victory would ensure the Chargers a playoff 
spot. Last year, Edison finished 9-1 overall, but lost the league title to 
Fountain Valley, the eventual Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Dave White says that memory is still fresh in the minds of his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel real fortunate to have another chance to win the league title," White 
said. "So it's like good news and bad news. The good news is that we have 
another shot, the bad news is we're going against the hottest team in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"Their confidence is at an all-time high. They just don't beat themselves. 
We're going to have to play a perfect game to beat them. But we're healthy and 
we feel like if we play the way we are capable of playing, we have a good 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's the biggest game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
Loara (6-1-1, 2-1) vs. Cypress (4-4, 1-2) at Western High School -- Loara Coach 
Herb Hill needs one more win to tie the county record for victories (190) set 
by the late Clare VanHoorebeke, who coached at Anaheim for 23 years. Hill will 
retire this season after 37 years of coaching, 28 at Loara. Coy Collins, the 
county's No. 2 performer in rushing (1,360 yards) and No. 3 in touchdowns (17), 
leads seventh-ranked Loara. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (7-1, 3-0) vs. El Dorado (0-8, 0-3) at Valencia High School -- 
Quarterback Todd Gragnano leads the county in passing yardage (1,825 yards) and 
running back Erik Mitchell has rushed for 968 yards and 20 touchdowns for 
fourth-ranked Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sea View League: 
</P>
<P>
University (2-6, 0-3) vs. Corona del Mar (5-3, 1-2) at Newport Harbor High 
School -- Corona del Mar, the defending Division IV champion and two-time 
defending league champion, is fighting for a playoff spot. The Sea Kings are 
led by running back Brian Lucas (672 yards, 10 touchdowns) and running 
back/linebacker/kicker Jerrott Willard. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's wide receiver/defensive back Warren Johnson -- who has five 
interceptions in seven games -- is out with a shin injury. 
</P>
<P>
Other games: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove League -- Los Amigos vs. La Quinta at Bolsa Grande High School; 
Sea View League -- University vs. Corona del Mar at Newport Harbor High School; 
South Coast League -- San Clemente vs. El Toro at Mission Viejo High School; 
nonleague -- L.A. Jordan vs. Mater Dei at Santa Ana Stadium.

FRESHMAN BACK CHASES HISTORY AT OCCIDENTAL; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: GARY LITTLE IS FOLLOWING THE TRAIL BLAZED BY SEVERAL ACCOMPLISHED 
ALUMNI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Mora, the coach of the New Orleans Saints, running back Vance Mueller of 
the Raiders, and Jack Kemp, a former pro quarterback who is now Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, all once donned the black, white and orange of 
the Occidental College football team. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Little knows the names of those celebrated alumni but not much else about 
Tiger history, which dates to 1900 when Oxy fielded its first team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a freshman," he says by way of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
But, if he can continue at his current pace, Little may add to the tradition by 
surpassing Mueller -- who ran for 2,974 yards from 1984-87 -- as Occidental's 
most productive runner. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been Occidental's starting tailback for only five games, Little 
ranks third in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with 
726 rushing yards. He already has eclipsed Mueller's freshman rushing total of 
611 yards and still has two games left, including Saturday night's game against 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental had presented a solid running game in Coach Dale Widolff's previous 
seven seasons with the Tigers, but Little's breakaway speed has provided the 
traditionally conservative attack with a welcome dose of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Little, 5-foot-9 and 171 pounds, has four runs of 40 yards or more, including a 
76-yard scoring jaunt three weeks ago in a 23-17 victory over previously 
unbeaten University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, Oxy has been, 'Grind it up, just three yards a shot,' " 
Occidental senior guard Roger Laubengayer said. "With Gary back there, it makes 
you feel better that you don't always have to grind it out and run 27 plays to 
score a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Widolff is pleased, if somewhat surprised, at the success Little is enjoying. 
He has seen too many college running backs start out quickly, only to slow 
markedly as they're subjected to weekly poundings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the jury is still out," Widolff said. "Obviously, he's (Little) got us 
excited. But I'm more of a wait-and-see guy." 
</P>
<P>
Said George White, who coached Little at Galileo High in San Francisco: "His 
potential was just starting to show. What's he going to be (like) in two years 
when that potential really starts coming out?" 
</P>
<P>
Little, who won't turn 18 until March, showed flashes of his speed and 
elusiveness during fall practice but was hampered by physical problems and his 
unfamiliarity with the system. He missed Occidental's opener against Menlo 
because of a shoulder injury and had only five carries for 10 yards in a 
reserve role against Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
However, a good week of practice and injuries that slowed senior Kevin Vegas 
and sophomore Steve McClaskey propelled Little into the starting lineup for the 
Tigers' SCIAC opener against Pomona-Pitzer. Little responded by rushing for 216 
yards in 25 carries as Occidental beat the Sagehens, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all confidence," Little said. "The more confidence you have, the better 
you feel. You don't second-guess yourself about which way you're going to run. 
You just pick and go." 
</P>
<P>
Little gained 118 yards the next week in a win over La Verne, then had his best 
game of the season against San Diego, rushing for a school-record 263 yards in 
31 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago against Claremont, Little ran into a defense designed 
specifically to contain him. But the emphasis on stopping the run opened up the 
passing game and Occidental routed the Stags, 44-14. Little gained just 68 
yards but had several key short runs for first downs. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that has been surprising isn't so much the spectacular, which 
everyone sees, but the way he's able to turn a four-yard run into a six-yard 
gain with second effort and by leaning forward when he's going down," Widolff 
says. "He's never really taken a direct hit because he's so elusive." 
</P>
<P>
Galileo High has produced several such runners, including O. J. Simpson. But 
Little can't get juiced about his own accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't an outstanding running back in high school," he says. Just good 
enough to gain more than 900 yards on a pass-oriented team that went 12-0 his 
senior year and won the Academic Athletic Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
His high school coach, a running back for Occidental in the 1950s and father of 
Occidental cornerback Ben White, suggested that Little check out his alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who was recruited by Stanford and Yale, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know L. A. could be like this," Little says in reference to the 
quiet, tree-lined Occidental campus. "I thought it was a hustle and bustle kind 
of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying the school was 10 minutes from downtown and I didn't want to 
go to a school in the middle of the city. I wanted a school in a nice 
residential area." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Little has found a home at Occidental, he's hoping to find a permanent 
place in the school's record book. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my goals is to get 1,000 yards in a season, but that may be hard now," 
Little says. "I'd be happier if we get a chance to go to the playoffs while I'm 
here and win the (Amos Alonzo) Stagg Bowl (the Division III championship game). 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a good way to go down in history."

SHOUP WEIGHS ALTERNATIVES AS CLU SEASON DRAWS TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Like Excalibur, the famed sword of King Arthur, the future of this Kingsman may 
not be set in stone. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, Cal Lutheran administrators decreed that the 1989 football 
season would be the last for Bob Shoup, the only head coach in the school's 28 
years of football. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will play its final game of the season Saturday against Azusa 
Pacific, but it may not be Shoup's last game as the coach of the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said that negotiations regarding his status should be resolved within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the confidential nature of the negotiations, Shoup chose to speak 
only in generalities, but he did say: "I'm trying to figure out what's in the 
best interests of the university and not be damaged. . . . There are some major 
considerations to be made. It would really surprise me if it could be done by 
this Friday. It involves a lot of people and a lot of attorneys. I thought at 
one time it might be put to rest last week." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said that various constituencies of the university must be dealt with in 
the decision, but that the discussions are now basically between himself and 
university President Jerry Miller, who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
About six options are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
A major issue for Shoup is a sabbatical leave, which was granted to him by the 
Cal Lutheran Board of Regents. The sabbatical need not run concurrently with 
the school year and was originally scheduled to begin in January and end in 
December, 1990. The beginning date and length may be negotiable, though. 
</P>
<P>
One of the six options reportedly would be for Shoup to take the sabbatical but 
still coach the football team next fall. Shoup hinted that another option would 
be to forgo the sabbatical, although he said, "I don't think I would do that. . 
. . The fact that it's in the contract is a given, the question is the way to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup contends that he should be able to retain not only his tenured teaching 
position after the sabbatical but also his job as coach. Shoup said that last 
year, when the team had a record of 2-8, was his most difficult as coach. 
Although the team has continued to play hard thus far in a 2-6 season, he is 
still eager for a sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of feel it's a fringe benefit that's really not been available to 
me," Shoup said. "All the other faculty get one every seven years." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup inaugurated the football program in 1962, and his team won the National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics championship in 1971. His career record is 
184-87-6, one of the best in the nation. His teams have won 13 NAIA District 3 
titles and played in three national championship games.

NORTH TORRANCE'S ERIC HANSEN NEEDS 7 CATCHES FOR RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An otherwise forgettable season for the North Torrance High football team will 
at least be memorable for the numbers of wide receiver Eric Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Saxons are 2-6 and have only an outside chance of reaching the 
playoffs, Hansen is on the verge of becoming the most productive pass catcher 
for a single season in South Bay history. 
</P>
<P>
With 72 catches in eight games, the 6-foot-1, 165-pound senior needs seven 
catches in North's last two Ocean League games to surpass St. Bernard's Jason 
Lucky, who had 78 receptions in 11 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Seven more catches will also put Hansen in the CIF-Southern Section record 
book. Mauricio Pavon of Pater Noster is 10th on the all-time list with 79 
catches in 1986. The record is 107, set by Steve Ybarra of Rosemead in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The most recognizable name in the top 10 is that of former Bishop Amat and USC 
star John McKay, who ranks second with 106 catches in 1969 and fourth with 97 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of our games, he's been our offense," North Coach Don Bohannon said of 
Hansen, who had 14 catches for 228 yards and two touchdowns last week in a 
33-24 win over Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
In most games, however, the pass-happy Saxons have had trouble getting the ball 
into the end zone. Hansen has scored only five touchdowns, and quarterback 
Brian Jurado, the South Bay passing leader with 1,580 yards, has only five TD 
throws in 138 completions. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a consistent running game has led to North's inflated passing stats 
and, generally speaking, an ineffective offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the horses up front to establish a running game," Bohannon 
complained. "When I first came over here, we were stacked up with linemen. Now 
we've gone through a dry spell. It's been tough." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's assault on the record books will continue Friday night when the Saxons 
(2-3 in the Ocean League) visit first-place West Torrance (7-1, 5-0). North 
needs to beat West and second-place South Torrance (4-4, 4-1) in its league 
finale Nov. 9 to have a chance of making the Division VII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Strong, The Times South Bay Coach of the Year in 1989, has stepped down as 
Torrance High basketball coach and will serve as a volunteer assistant this 
season at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated with the CIF cutting back on basketball (practice)," Strong 
said, explaining his reasons for resigning. "I didn't feel we were giving the 
kids a fair shot at learning how to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to start practice Nov. 1. Now it's the (13th) of November, and we're 
starting to play games the first of December. What's that, two weeks of 
preparation? You really don't have the opportunity to teach anything. It's like 
rolling the ball out on the court and saying, 'Let's play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Strong, who coached Torrance for four years, guided the team to a surprising 
season in 1989. Picked by the coaches to finish last in the Bay League, the 
Tartars were in the hunt for the title before finishing third. They reached the 
quarterfinals of the 4-AA Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Strong's replacement, Bob Little, is familiar with the program. He coached 
Torrance from the early 1970s to 1985, when he resigned and began coaching the 
sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
"He got burned out," Strong said. "He needed a break. But he was antsy to get 
back into it last year." 
</P>
<P>
This marks the third time Strong, under three different head coaches, has 
served as an assistant at El Camino. He helped the Warriors win a conference 
title under Ron Jacobs and a state title under Paul Landreaux. Now he'll try to 
help second-year Coach Ron McClurkin do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance will be led this season by All-CIF guard Rick Robison, a 6-foot-2 
sharpshooter who averaged 28.6 points a game last year as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, Robison has received little interest from colleges, Strong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some schools are concerned about his size," he said. "He's a No. 2 
guard, and most schools recruiting No. 2 guards are looking for players around 
6-5. 
</P>
<P>
"But, with the season he had last year, he has put himself in position to be 
recruited. It will be interesting to watch him progress. Now they're going to 
start looking at him under a magnifying glass." 
</P>
<P>
Are Hawthorne and Leuzinger fit to be tied again? 
</P>
<P>
The answer will come Friday night when they meet in a key Bay League game at 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The Centinela Valley Union High School District rivals have tied the last two 
seasons and three of the last four. Last year's score was 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be a tie this year, but you never know," said 
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes. "We're not going into this thing looking for a 
tie. It's not anything we've discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger entered last year's game unbeaten and favored, but finds itself in 
the underdog role this season. Hawthorne (8-0 overall) is ranked No. 1 in the 
Southern Section Division II poll and leads the Bay League with a 5-0 record. 
Leuzinger (6-1-1, 3-1-1) is in third place and fighting to remain in playoff 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians have never missed the playoffs in five previous seasons under 
Carnes. But with their final two games on the road against Hawthorne and Santa 
Monica, the coach is worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a win in one of our last two games," Carnes said. "Otherwise, we'll be 
sitting up in the bleachers." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside basketball co-coach Ron Randle says the Monarchs boast one of the 
area's budding stars in Tyrone Paul, a 6-5 senior swingman. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sleeper before the summer started, but once it ended everybody knew 
about him," Randle said. "Some of the bigger schools are starting to recruit 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Randle compares Paul's leaping ability to that of two of the South Bay's 
all-time dunkmasters -- Joey Johnson of Banning and Harold Miner of Inglewood. 
Paul, who reportedly can touch the top of the square on the backboard, won dunk 
contests last summer at the Superstars camp at UC Santa Barbara and at Carson 
High's Grand Finale tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Morningside will be the site of the fourth annual Inglewood 
Fundamentals Basketball Clinic, to be held from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. 
The clinic, which is free and open to players in sixth grade and up, will 
feature members of the coaching staffs from Long Beach State, UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's football team, struggling to establish a running game through its 
first five games, apparently found a running back last Friday in its 41-6 win 
over San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Muhammad, an unheralded junior, scored three touchdowns, including an 
82-yard kickoff return, as the Colts improved to 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a super runner," Coach Gene Vollnogle said. "He runs like Marcus Allen. 
He's very fluid. He weaves. It looks like people should be tackling him, but 
they bounce off him." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said he hopes to get Muhammad more carries Friday night when Carson 
meets Dorsey in a Pacific League opener at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. Last 
week, he had just two carries for 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason behind the success of West Torrance's football team has been the 
play of its special teams, led by return specialists Josh Moore and Ryan Berry, 
who have combined for five touchdowns on runbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a senior, has returned nine kickoffs for 372 yards (a 41.3 average) and 
two touchdowns, including a 77-yarder last week against South Torrance, and has 
eight punt returns for 178 yards (a 22.3 average) and one TD. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, a junior, has returned nine punts for 157 yards (a 17.4 average) and two 
TDs. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Four former South Bay basketball standouts were cut Tuesday by 
National Basketball Assn. teams: Mark Wade (Banning) and Anthony Frederick 
(Gardena) by the Indiana Pacers, Mike Doktorczyk (Mary Star) by the Chicago 
Bulls and Corey Gaines (St. Bernard) by the Denver Nuggets. . . . The 
Pepperdine women's basketball team will play an intrasquad scrimmage tonight at 
7:30 at Palos Verdes High. Admission is free. . . . The Morningside girls 
basketball team, led by 6-5 senior Lisa Leslie, has been ranked No. 1 in the 
nation by Street and Smith's magazine. Leslie, last year's State Player of the 
Year, was named a first-team All-American by the publication. . . . The Palos 
Verdes girls cross-country team is No. 3 this week in the Kinney California 
State High School rankings. The Sea Kings trail Agoura and Woodbridge of Irvine 
in the Division I poll.

Adolph Coors Co.: The brewer's third-quarter net income dipped 3% from a year 
ago to $21 million. Sales totaled a record $583.3 million, up 17%. The Golden, 
Colo., firm attributed earnings results to increased manufacturing costs, 
particularly packaging materials, and price competition in the beer business. 
The figures came despite improved sales in all its major businesses and the 
introduction of Keystone and Keystone Light, Coors Brewing's first entries into 
the popular-priced category.

Grumman Corp.: The aerospace and electronics firm reported third-quarter net 
income of $16.9 million, down 25% from the 1988 period, on revenue of $905.4 
million, up 9%. The Bethpage, N.Y., company said the 1988 results included an 
after-tax benefit of $11.1 million resulting from an accounting adjustment for 
state franchise taxes. It said the higher revenue was primarily because of 
increased sales in the aerospace segment.

PARENTS' REVOLT DELAYS MERGER OF 2 SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BATTLE OVER WESTLAKE SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AND HARVARD SCHOOL FOR BOYS IS 
AN UPHILL STRUGGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed merger of Westlake School for girls and Harvard School for boys has 
been delayed a month amid a continuing revolt by parents. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-day delay of the final vote, announced on the eve of the Westlake Board 
of Trustees meeting last Thursday, is the first indication that the merger of 
the two prestigious schools, promoted as a "done deal," might come undone. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that they face an uphill struggle, parents have mounted a 
multi-pronged attack on the plan that, if approved, would mean the end of the 
85-year-old all-girls school. 
</P>
<P>
They are poised to ask the state attorney general to block the merger as 
ill-conceived and hastily announced. In a draft of a letter to Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp, which has not been sent, they charge that the board has acted 
capriciously on anecdotal advice, without the due diligence required under the 
California Corporations Code. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise announcement last month that the two schools would be merged into 
Harvard-Westlake School in 1991 triggered an intense backlash among Westlake 
parents that has not abated despite efforts by the board and administration to 
downplay its depth. 
</P>
<P>
The brouhaha is a battle royal involving many of the city's movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
Philanthropist couple Helen and Peter Bing, the largest benefactors of Westlake 
and Harvard, are enthusiastic backers of the merger. The Westlake Board of 
Trustees is dotted with names such as Sam Goldwyn, Aaron Spelling and David May 
II, of the department store family. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent parents meeting held in an auditorium named for director Garry 
Marshall, singer Howard Keel boomed out his dismay about the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
A number of players have ties at both schools and in the community. Richard 
Close has a daughter at Westlake and a son who graduated from Harvard last 
year. Wearing his hat as president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., Close 
said he fears that the merger will bring more traffic to Coldwater Canyon 
Boulevard in neighboring Studio City, home of Harvard, which will provide the 
high school campus under the merger plan. The junior high grades will be taught 
at the Holmby Hills Westlake campus. 
</P>
<P>
If either school came to the city seeking conditional-use permits or zoning 
changes, the matter could come before one of two key city commissions. A 
Westlake father sits on the Planning Commission, and a Harvard father sits on 
the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the postponement, Harvard sent out a bulletin to its parents this week 
saying the merger was expected to go forward. Harvard Headmaster Thomas C. 
Hudnut said in an interview that he based his optimism on assurances from his 
counterpart at Westlake, Nathan Reynolds, who did not respond to several 
requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hudnut, Reynolds said the delay would provide more time "to bring 
more trustees up to speed" about the disputed issue. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the merger are skeptical that it is a now-or-never matter that 
must be speedily enacted while a "window of opportunity" is open, a posture 
that makes Westlake the suitor. They question the premise on which the merger 
was based -- that Westlake could not compete with a Harvard expected to go 
coeducational on its own. Underlying the dissension is a philosophy -- 
demonstrated in research and fostered by the headmaster who now favors a merger 
-- that single-sex education is superior for girls. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who are not opposed to coeducation take issue with the deal's terms, 
which give Harvard a 2-1 majority on the board of trustees. "This is not a 
merger, it's an acquisition," said Rod Berle, a member of the Westlake Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Another festering issue is religion. Harvard, whose bylaws will govern the 
merged institution, falls under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Diocese, a 
relationship some Westlake parents do not like. 
</P>
<P>
The intense opposition has been fueled by revelations large and small. A wire 
service report from 1978 was unearthed in which the Harvard headmaster extolled 
the benefits of his membership in an exclusive Washington, D.C., males-only 
club. 
</P>
<P>
The Westlake administration's private opinion about Harvard boys -- that they 
are "obnoxious" -- also was revealed in a confidential memo distributed to 
members at a board retreat in June and obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
On a page entitled "Problems for Harvard if They Go Co-Ed," under the 
subheading "Intimidating Atmosphere at Harvard," an administrator whose name is 
not contained on the document wrote the following: 
</P>
<P>
"Only the most socially aggressive and confident girls will feel comfortable 
after visiting Harvard. The admissions office doesn't encourage families to 
visit now because the boys are so obnoxious. Imagine the possibilities when 
little girls start to visit for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
The memo mentions an incident involving a Westlake student who appeared at a 
Harvard assembly to promote a joint production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" and 
who complained of harassment from the boys. 
</P>
<P>
Hudnut said the incident was an "eye of the beholder" situation. Women faculty 
members in the front row did not detect any disrespect in the boys' behavior, 
their headmaster said. 
</P>
<P>
As for his membership in the Cosmos Club, which has since changed its policies 
to admit women, Hudnut said, "It is irrelevant." According to Hudnut, belonging 
to the club was a "very useful adjunct" in Washington that did not detract from 
his ability to educate both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the merger have been rankled by what they perceive as the 
presumption of the pro-merger forces. At an emotional meeting in which parents 
repeatedly asked to have a voice in the merger decision, Westlake board 
President Alan Levy replied testily, "This is not a shareholders' meeting. 
There are no stockholders in this corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Although that is technically correct, because the power is vested in the Board 
of Trustees, such statements have galvanized opponents of the merger, who are 
not accustomed to being dismissed so summarily. 
</P>
<P>
According to Berle, the Westlake board has hired former Los Angeles Unified 
School District Supt. Harry Handler to evaluate the data about the predicted 
dearth of high-quality applicants for Westlake if Harvard goes co-ed without 
it. A number of committees seeking parent reaction have also been formed. 
</P>
<P>
"Window dressing," Berle said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are also critical of a letter that went out this month on pre-printed 
"Harvard-Westlake" stationery to elementary schools where sixth-graders might 
apply for admission. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Higgins, a Westlake parent, said the mailing was a "dangerous 
thing for the board to allow to happen," creating liability by presenting 
something that had not yet been approved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fund-raising campaign is under way to demonstrate to the board 
that Westlake will be economically viable if students do defect to a Harvard 
that goes coeducational on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $100,000 was raised by those at the meeting. In addition, Berle said, he 
has presented a pledge for a $1-million cushion to protect the school from the 
loss of large benefactors who might fall away if the merger collapses. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, many parents, though not for attribution, say Helen Bing as a 
source of funds would be lost if Westlake remains as it is. Bing's generosity 
is a mainstay of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Though merger opponents are far from claiming victory, Berle said, there are 
many more "borderline" board members than there were three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hudnut predicted that despite the scrutiny, the merger will hang 
together. "I think the overriding benefits of it will be sufficiently clear to 
the people whose responsibility it is to make the deal go forward," he said.

WINDOW OPENS FOR W. HOLLYWOOD CONDOS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: A NEW POLICY WILL LET OWNERS OF ILLEGALLY CONVERTED CONDOS WHO BOUGHT 
THEM BETWEEN DEC. 17, 1986, AND JULY 13 OF THIS YEAR SELL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN 
IMMOBILIZED IN LEGAL CROSS-FIRE. 
</P>

<P>
Hundreds of West Hollywood condominium owners trapped in a legal battle between 
the city and developers accused of illegally converting apartments to 
condominiums have won two victories that may spring them free. 
</P>
<P>
City officials announced Tuesday that they would issue substitute permits that 
would legally designate units as condominiums if they were bought between Dec. 
17, 1986, and July 13, 1989, from developers who made illegal conversions. The 
permits would allow owners to sell units that have been immobilized. 
</P>
<P>
"For all intents and purposes, we are allowing these units to be considered as 
condominiums," said City Atty. Michael Jenkins. "We are doing this because we 
think it is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like this should take care of the problem," said condominium owner 
Steve Sapunor. "But they have yet to write the ordinance, the actual language 
on permits." 
</P>
<P>
The city's announcement is the latest action on the West Hollywood law 
preventing the conversion of apartment buildings to condominiums without city 
approval. The state Supreme Court last Thursday agreed to review a July appeals 
court decision upholding the law. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on condominium conversions has been a legal bouncing ball since West 
Hollywood, upon its cityhood in 1984, placed a moratorium on the conversions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city strengthened the ban, adopting an ordinance prohibiting the 
conversion of rental units without obtaining city permits. 
</P>
<P>
Building owners went ahead with conversions, citing permission granted by Los 
Angeles County before West Hollywood's incorporation, and the city went to 
court to attempt to halt the sale of former apartment units as condominiums. 
Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled against the city on three occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The city was victorious in the most recent round, when a state Court of Appeal 
in July directed a lower court to issue a restraining order barring future 
conversions. 
</P>
<P>
City officials interpreted the July decision as giving them complete control 
over what will happen to 26 buildings with nearly 600 units, at least 300 of 
which were sold to individuals whose property rights were called into question. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who had bought the units between the 1986 ordinance and the July 
decision suddenly found their ownership of the units called into question. 
Because they were unable to obtain the proper city permits designating the 
units as condominiums, many owners who wished to sell were unable to do so. In 
addition, realty agents had been steering potential buyers away from the units 
while they floated in legal limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Abbe Land said the city had been negotiating a solution to the problem 
long before last week's announcement by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We found . . . that some people were kind of stuck," Land said. "It has never 
been our intention to hold people from doing what they want." 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's plan, expected to be formalized at the Nov. 6 City Council 
meeting, qualified owners will be able to fill out simple forms allowing them 
to have their property legally declared condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Permits will be automatically granted to those who show they bought their 
disputed units within the specified time period. Those buying condominiums 
after July 13 would be subject to individual scrutiny, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Land said there would be no fees for the permits. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium owners took cautious heart in the city's announcement, but some are 
still skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I only doubt it from past experience. They have made promises before," said 
owner Eric Pearl. Pearl became embroiled in a heated exchange with Jenkins on 
Tuesday when he questioned the sincerity of the deal. "It is also three or four 
months too late. Property values have dropped; it's now a buyer's market. And 
people are still afraid to come look at the buildings."

W. HOLLYWOOD VOTERS TO SETTLE NEW CIVIC CENTER DISPUTE TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most pitched and divisive political battle in the city of West Hollywood's 
five-year history will be settled Tuesday when voters decide whether to build a 
$23-million civic center in West Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The groups behind two competing initiatives bear similar names, and each claims 
to be the savior of the park, but comparisons end there. The Save Our Parks 
Coalition ballot measure would ban the city from building in the park. An 
initiative sponsored by People for West Hollywood Parks calls for the civic 
center, complete with offices and council chambers, to be built in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the civic center, led by Councilman Steve Schulte, call it an 
extravagant, wasteful monument to a city government barely 5 years old. They 
say it is a potentially expensive boondoggle that will reduce the city's 
already tiny park acreage and could cost a lot more than $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Heilman is leading pro-civic center forces who say it will 
provide a much-needed home for city government, revive a park beset by crime 
and drug problems, and eventually save the city millions of dollars in rent for 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte and Heilman -- who frequently clash on other issues -- stop short of 
calling this a referendum on their respective styles, but they acknowledge that 
the civic center fight has exacerbated the tension between them. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project hope a vote in their favor would also have a coattail 
effect of encouraging fiscal responsibility and chipping away at a Heilman-led 
council majority that "doesn't listen to its people." 
</P>
<P>
"Our issue from the beginning was strictly the park, not (council elections) in 
1990. But it is also an outrageous amount of money that we don't have, a 
squander of reserves. We are going to be in debt if we build this," said Save 
Our Parks Coalition Chairman Tom Larkin. "This is a vote begging (the council 
majority) to listen. If we win, things will change; they will have to start 
listening to their constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have said the proposed civic center would remove invaluable park 
space in violation of a city law. The project would remove a public swimming 
pool and public auditorium with no plans to replace them, and opponents say a 
proposed landscaped area within the complex cannot be considered recreational 
space. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Michael Jenkins has issued a lengthy legal opinion finding that 
the Schulte-sponsored initiative illegally prevents the city government from 
exercising its right to govern public property. On the basis of that opinion, 
Heilman and Councilwoman Helen Albert have said that they do not intend to be 
bound by the Schulte initiative if it passes. If both pass, the measure with 
the most votes would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the battle, anti-civic center forces have claimed the 
"grass-roots" turf on the issue. Their proposition to keep the civic center out 
of the park was placed on the ballot with a petition last spring containing 
over 3,200 signatures, after missing on a first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Heilman-sponsored initiative was placed on the ballot by a 4-1 vote of the 
City Council after the Schulte measure qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that pro-civic center forces have reached outside the city to 
find precinct walkers and people to work their phones, indicating a campaign 
struggling to find converts within its own community. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the UCLA Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning found 
notes offering $7 an hour to work for the pro-civic center forces stuffed in 
their mailboxes last week. The flyers, put out by a consultant for the 
pro-civic center side, begin: "Attention for those interested in money . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had to pay anybody at this point to do anything except our mail," 
Schulte said. "I think it shows how much trouble they are having getting their 
people out." 
</P>
<P>
Heilman denied that the flyers indicated a lack of support for the civic 
center, and said it is often the case that voters who are satisfied with the 
status quo -- in this case the council majority -- are harder to mobilize. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think (the council members) are doing a good job, and they are 
not as easy to recruit as angry people," Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent financial disclosure statements, up to Oct. 21, indicate a 
relatively inexpensive campaign so far. The pro-civic center forces report 
receiving just over $5,000. The opposition reports nearly $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
But with a series of slick mailers, often costing as much as $2,000 to 
distribute, coming from each side, it seems likely that last-minute donations 
and reports will swell the cost of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition mailers have been focused primarily on park preservation, but much 
of the early effort attacked the fiscal aspects of the expensive project and 
raised the specter that the city would have to assess new taxes to pay for its 
"palace in the park." 
</P>
<P>
"They tell people there will be no new taxes for this, but they have already 
gotten the business license tax, and the increased parking meter fees. They are 
taking from one pot to put in the other," Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
As the election nears, the opposition has latched on to a number of side issues 
to win support, and pro-civic center forces have fought off assaults from many 
sides. When the Schulte camp mobilized a number of senior citizens and a gay 
swim team that use the public pool that would be destroyed under the civic 
center proposal, Heilman began talking about how it could be replaced. Though a 
pool was originally included in the plans, it was scrapped when the plan ran 
into budget restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"They never even thought about the pool until we made it an issue," Schulte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Heilman and others accuse the opponents of trying to open a non-existent 
Pandora's box of complaints just to run contrary to the city government. He 
cited a recent news conference at which opponents advocated building a slightly 
less expensive, far less elaborate, City Hall at Johnson's Tow Yard on the 
other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
"They oppose everything. They are not concerned with making the city a better 
place. They are just negative rabble-rousers," Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heated rhetoric, accusations, and mudslinging in the campaign, both 
Schulte and Heilman downplay the political significance of the election beyond 
the issue of saving the park or building the civic center. 
</P>
<P>
But with both men facing re-election next April, some believe the civic center 
fight will indicate the direction of West Hollywood government in the future. 
If the civic center is built, many believe it could provide an impenetrable 
fortress for Heilman and his supporters heading into the spring elections. If 
Schulte prevails, many civic center opponents think it could be the first brick 
removed from a long-standing majority wall.

MORE FAMILY THAN A CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE STYLE: THE BOOK CLUB HAS LASTED 50 YEARS AND IS STILL GOING STRONG -- SO 
ARE THE FRIENDSHIPS THAT WERE FORMED THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The women have met twice a month for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Their ostensible purpose has been to talk about nonfiction. They have reported 
on and had spirited conversations about more than a thousand books. But the 
Book Club, as the dozen women call their durable association, is more than a 
discussion group. It is a certainty in lives that inevitably change. It is as 
real a structure as a temple or a marriage, a mechanism that allows its members 
to learn together, to be together, whatever else is happening in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing more important than coming to Book Club," Ruth Caplan said at 
a recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruth," another member explained, "has been secretary since Adam and Eve." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1939, actually. The founders were members of Hadassah, a Jewish 
charitable organization, and many of them, with their husbands, met regularly 
to play cards as well as do good works. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it '38 or '39?" one member asked, trying to nail down the exact moment 
Book Club was born. "It was 1939," another recalled. "We were building our 
house then." 
</P>
<P>
The unspeakable was happening in Europe, and the women raised money that saved 
some lives. Their own lives were comfortable and full, busy with raising 
children, supporting successful husbands and doing volunteer work. "We were 
lovely couples," recalled Florence Skoss, now widowed, as are most of the 
women. "We were all at the baby stage. Now we're at the arthritis stage." 
</P>
<P>
The women are still busy, their lives still full. They travel. They do 
volunteer work at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, with the city's cultural 
organizations and elsewhere. They have grandchildren, some of whom are now 
having children of their own. They study music, art, Judaism or pursue other 
passions. A few years ago, Edith Greenberg worked at a home for the aged in 
Israel. Her responsibilities included trimming trees two days a week in a 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
And twice a month they gather for Book Club. 
</P>
<P>
From its inception, it "was our fun time," a member said. Fun, but a serious 
social obligation as well. "The only excuse for not coming was a wedding or a 
funeral," Skoss said. 
</P>
<P>
During the early years, Book Club included tea. Now "the girls," as they often 
refer to themselves, begin with lunch. They usually meet at a member's home, 
although most no longer live in the big houses in Bel-Air, Beverly Hills and 
Westwood they maintained before the children dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some book clubs, this one does not require all its members to read a 
particular book in advance. Reviewers report on books of their choosing. "We 
always learn something at Book Club," Ruth Resnik said. Interruptions are de 
rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
Of the scores of books that have been reviewed, the one everyone remembers with 
special fondness was a study of black holes, reviewed some years ago by the 
late Estelle Grossman. Although the members are well-read and widely traveled, 
none knew much about black holes until Grossman explained the cosmic 
phenomenon. "It was like lighting up a new part of the world for us," recalled 
Resnik. 
</P>
<P>
The Book Club members have established a scholarship at the Hebrew University 
in Jerusalem in memory of Grossman and two other members who have died. 
</P>
<P>
"All these 50 years there has never been an argument," a member said, quickly 
adding, "There's been a difference of opinion." As Caplan observed, "What's so 
important is to share what we love with one another." 
</P>
<P>
It is Judy Klingstein's turn to review. The tiny redhead has been ill lately 
and has made the best of it by reading biographies. She reports on Arthur 
Miller's autobiography, "Timebends." The other members sit around her as rapt 
as schoolgirls for more than two hours as she summarizes Miller's book. Some 
slip out of their shoes. One or two knit while listening. Chocolates are 
quietly passed around. 
</P>
<P>
Klingstein, who is a polished public speaker and former teacher, shares a vast 
frame of reference with the other members of the group. She doesn't have to 
explain her allusions to Ibsen, the playwright, or the photographer 
Cartier-Bresson. Her report includes personal insights and recollections, 
including how exciting New York City was during the brilliant theatrical season 
of 1935, when she and Hilda Silton were fresh out of UCLA, taking graduate 
courses at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was born in 1915, two years after Klingstein, and at the end of her 
report, she reads his observations about being a grandfather. She doesn't 
apologize for getting misty-eyed. "I can't help it, I'm emotional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Book Club has clearly been a source of solace for its members. "We've all had 
one kind of trouble or another, but we all sustain each other," Klingstein 
said. "Everybody's been through everybody's happiness and everybody's 
heartache," Skoss said. But unlike groups whose whole purpose is support, Book 
Club always involves the consideration of ideas. It is an affair of the mind as 
well as the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about the petty things, the nothings," Skoss said. Greenberg 
agreed. "There's practically no gossip in this group," she said. "It's 
wonderful." 
</P>

recent Book Club meeting. Judy Klingstein arranged her notes, book and water, 
and then presented review to 10 attentive friends and club members. JEROME

AZUSA UNIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five candidates are vying for three board seats in the Azusa Unified School 
District, which has 10,357 students. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Bradway, 47, is an industrial electronics consultant. An Azusa High 
graduate, he has lived in the city on and off since 1952 and has a son in a 
local school. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Rosemary Garcia, 44, has served on the board for five years and 
has always lived in the city. A consumer service representative in the city's 
utilities department, she has five children and taught catechism for two years 
at St. Francis of Rome Church. 
</P>
<P>
Inez Z. Gutierrez, 54, has been on the board for 18 years and teaches religion 
at St. Francis. She has sent three children through Azusa schools. Born in 
Azusa, the Citrus High graduate has served on the city's advisory personnel 
board for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Eunice P. Harrington, a San Gabriel elementary and junior high teacher for 19 
years, has served on the board eight years. A Parks and Recreation commissioner 
for eight years, she has served as director of the county School Board Trustees 
Assn. She is pursuing a doctoral degree in education at Pacific Western 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Louis A. Zamora, 28, owns a limousine service and is data processing director 
at an accounting firm. He chairs the watchdog Azusa Taxpayers Assn. Born in 
Azusa, he graduated from Gladstone High and served in the Marine Corps for 
seven years. He has three children in district schools. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park Unified 
</P>
<P>
In the Baldwin Park Unified School District, which serves 15,707 students from 
kindergarten through 12th grade, three candidates are running for two school 
board seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the candidates, Robert C. Gair and Robert Viramontes, are longtime 
incumbents. Gair, 56, an estimator for a roofing company, has served on the 
board for 17 years. Viramontes, 47, an assistant director of data processing 
for the county Office of Education, has served for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
They cite the district's financial solvency, rising test scores and successful 
drug-prevention programs as reasons why they should be be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Their challenger is Anthony J. Bejarano, 41, a retired railroad switchman, who 
is running for public office for the first time. He is the founder of the Paul 
Bejarano Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a counseling and educational 
organization that he formed after his son's death. 
</P>
<P>
Bejarano, who says he would donate the modest stipend received by school board 
members to a scholarship fund, contends that the current board does not devote 
enough time to interacting with high-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett Unified 
</P>
<P>
Six candidates, including three incumbents, are vying for three seats on the 
Bassett Unified School District Board of Education. About 5,100 students attend 
schools in the western La Puente district, which has an annual budget of about 
$20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers are personnel commissioner Anna A. Aguilar; businessman Robert J. 
Fuentes and railroad employee Brenda J. Johnson. They say that feuding board 
members have impeded the district's ability to tackle problems such as drug use 
and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers point to hostility displayed by incumbents Carol A. Smithberg, 55, 
and Hector Varela, 46, at a candidates' forum last week. Incumbent Barbara Boyd 
is also running. 
</P>
<P>
Varela and Smithberg concede that they have deep philosophical differences 
about how the district should be run. But "we are very polite to each other," 
Smithberg said. "The district is being run well." 
</P>
<P>
Varela, who is running for his third term, says his experience on the board 
qualifies him for reelection.

In June, Varela was the only board member who voted against consolidating 
school bus stops and eliminating several routes. The district approved the 
$100,000 cut from its $450,000 transportation budget but later reversed itself 
after more than 100 parents protested.

Charter Oak Unified 
</P>
<P>
Two incumbents and a challenger are vying for two seats on the Charter Oak 
Unified School District board. The district has 5,668 students in parts of 
Covina, Glendora and San Dimas and the unincorporated area of Charter Oak. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph E. Bristol, 55, a 12-year board veteran, has a bachelor of arts degree 
from Cal State Los Angeles and a master of science degree from USC. He is a

Claremont Unified 
</P>
<P>
In the Claremont Unified School District, which has 11 schools and 5,900 
students, three incumbents are seeking reelection against a single challenger 
in a campaign that has drawn little interest. 
</P>
<P>
Judith W. Cody, 45, a real estate agent, said she is running on a strong record 
that ranges from efforts to establish substance abuse programs in Claremont 
elementary schools to her service as chairman of a San Gabriel valley coalition 
on education. 
</P>
<P>
John Dierking, 27, a University of La Verne law student and substitute teacher, 
is challenging the incumbents. He charged that some members want to increase 
vocational education courses, thereby reducing the district's traditional 
emphasis on academic programs. Dierking, a graduate of Claremont High School 
and Pitzer College, said the district should continue to offer a solid academic 
foundation to all students. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Fay, 52, a financial planner and former teacher, said Dierking's 
suggestion is untrue. Fay said that the district should pay more attention to 
the needs of students who plan to end their formal education at high school but 
that no one wants to diminish the academic program. Fay, who has served on the 
board for eight years, said the absence of major issues in the election 
reflects the fact that board members have been working well together. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Keith, 46, a public relations consultant, said that when she ran four years 
ago, there were a number of controversial problems, including troubled 
relations between teachers and the district. This year, she said, the campaign 
has been low-key because there are no major issues. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
There are 4,200 students in the Duarte Unified School District. Incumbent James 
M. Bowers and challengers Kenneth Bell and Phillip R. Reyes are vying for two 
seats on the board. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
El Monte City 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates are vying for three seats in a relatively quiet election for 
the El Monte City School District board, whose members have engaged in some 
acrimonious personality clashes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The board oversees a district of 18 elementary schools with 10,970 students. 
</P>
<P>
David Reed, a Glendora print shop owner, is seeking a second four-year term. He 
has proposed a system of what he calls "strategic planning" for the district, 
to avoid "last-minute" decision-making. "I'm looking for more long-range 
planning and input from the community to set the direction of the district," 
said Reed, who has two children in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Mante, who also is seeking a second term, has contended that there are 
virtually no issues in this year's election. "We just have the same types of 
problems that all the districts face," said Mante, a housewife whose only son 
graduated from Arroyo High School last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Weldon, a school secretary in the district, said that "the district is in 
great shape," but that her years as a PTA member could provide some special 
insight into district problems. "I'd like to have a little input into decisions 
that are coming up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin J. Cichy, an attorney, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte Union High School 
</P>
<P>
Three seats are up for grabs on the El Monte Union High School District board, 
which has helped to initiate an extraordinary construction surge in the last 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Ground has been broken for an adult education center, which will be the 
second-largest such school in the state. Construction of a new building and 
gymnasium for El Monte High School is also planned. The district has four 
comprehensive high schools and a continuation school, with 8,500 full-time 
students and 13,000 part-time adult students. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Archer, an educational representative for California Edison, is seeking a 
third four-year term. "There are so many projects under way that appear 
meritorious that I decided to see them through to completion," said Archer, a 
former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brown, who owns a fire extinguisher company in El Monte, said the 
current board should remain intact because of its record. "We've got a good 
board, with good liberals and good conservatives," he said. "We're able to work 
out issues without a lot of petty infighting." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Mahoney, a seventh-grade teacher in Rosemead, said it is important for 
continuity to be maintained on the board for the sake of the building program. 
"We've started all these things, now we'd like to finish them," she said. She 
said she wants to lower dropout rates and improve test scores. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marin, an assistant principal in Pomona and a former member of the El Monte 
City School District board, is the only challenger. He could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey 
</P>
<P>
The Garvey School District contains 11 elementary and two junior high schools 
serving more than 7,400 children in Rosemead and parts of Monterey Park, San 
Gabriel and South San Gabriel. Three of the five school board seats are up for 
election. Candidates: 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Diaz, 31, Rosemead, is academic-community coordinator with the UCLA 
mental health programs. She attended Garvey schools and has a bachelor's degree 
from Cal State Los Angeles and a master's degree in social work from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Earleen Green, 59, Rosemead, is a campaign secretary for the Alhambra YMCA. She 
worked for the Garvey School District for 29 years before retiring last year. 
She went through the Garvey system and attended Mark Keppel High School, Sawyer

Southern California Edison. She attended Henry Ford Community College in 
Dearborn, Mich., and is a founding member of the South San Gabriel Neighborhood

</P>
<P>
Hacienda La Puente Unified 
</P>
<P>
Debate over use of so-called morbid reading books is dominating the race for 
three seats on the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District board, which 
serves 22,295 students from Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Industry and Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
The district has temporarily banned the books, a series of literature-based 
Canadian texts. Meanwhile, it has voted to reprint and keep teaching the 
less-controversial stories and poems. 
</P>
<P>
Several challengers say the board should have taken a different stance. 
</P>
<P>
Joe R. Chavez, 52, a Hacienda Heights data-processing supervisor, said the 
issue "was poorly handled. I don't think the books are appropriate." He added: 
"All the present school board members are either teachers or administrators. 
Most of the things they do are in their own self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne A. Garcia, 46, a La Puente educator, said she would pay more attention 
to academic programs and cultivating leadership skills. She blames the morbid 
book controversy on the fact that parents were not involved in choosing their 
children's textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Ann Holguin-Fallon, a La Puente educator, said the board erred in buying 
the books. "Half of that series isn't approved by the state," she said. "Most 
large school districts choose books off the adopted list." While she agreed 
that there are some morbid stories, she objects to the books mainly on cultural 
grounds. "The idioms and colloquialisms are uniquely Canadian and don't address 
themselves to children in the U.S," Holguin-Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Hsu, 54, a Hacienda Heights postal manager, says it is time for some 
fresh faces on the board. "This controversy with the morbid books, it proves 
that there is a lack of communication between the board and the parents. The 
board should involve the parents in the selection process,"' Hsu said. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Sandy Johnson, 53, Hacienda Heights, running for a second term, 
stresses her background and involvement in statewide school funding issues. 
Johnson says the morbid book issue has been politicized and sensationalized. 
But she adds that "we have to wait and see what kind of settlement Holt (the 
publisher) is willing to make. The books we received, the stories are totally 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth C. Kim, 61, Hacienda Heights is running for a fourth term and says his 
experience makes him a stabilizing force. Kim defended the controversial 
series, saying it was screened by state administrators and local teachers. Kim 
says he thinks parents will eventually support the books. "Granted there are 
some stories that we weren't even aware were going to be in the book, but as 
soon as we found out, we told teachers to avoid those stories," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
Other challengers are Lyla A. Eddington, a community college administrator, and 
Robert F. Nero, a high school principal. Both live in Hacienda Heights; neither 
could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Monrova Unified 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates are running for two board seats in the Monrovia Unified School 
District, which has 5,440 students. In addition, three candidates are vying for 
two years of the unexpired term of Sarah Koch, who resigned last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in the regular election: 
</P>
<P>
David G. Draper, 37, has worked in electrical engineering for 15 years. He 
received his degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia and has lived in 
Monrovia for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Goudy, 44, has served on the board for four years and is a secretary 
in a real estate firm. A founding member of the Monrovia Drug Awareness task 
force, Goudy is on the Monrovia Coordinating Council and the Chamber of 
Commerce's government affairs committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Purdy, 57, has taught history in Pasadena for 30 years and is also 
completing his first term on the board. Two daughters have graduated from 
schools in Monrovia, where he has lived for 26 years. He teaches business 
administration at Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Scranton Jr., 45, is assistant principal at Downey's Los Padrinos 
Juvenile Hall. A seven-year Monrovia resident, Scranton is president of Court 
School Educators of Southern California and holds bachelor's and master's 
degrees from Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the special election: 
</P>
<P>
Frances Cash, 43, is a bilingual aide at Plymouth Elementary School and has 
been involved in PTAs for 14 years. Born in the city, Cash is a Monrovia High 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Flucker, 39, is a mortgage clerk and 15-year PTA volunteer. A 10-year 
Monrovia resident, she teaches Sunday school at the Divine Guidance Church. 
</P>
<P>
John R. Ralles, 38, is the Lincoln High School math department chairman in Los 
Angeles. He holds a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a master's in educational 
administration from Cal State Los Angeles. He is a 10-year Monrovia resident. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain View 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates, including three incumbents, are running for three seats on 
the Mountain View School District Board of Education, which serves about 8,500 
elementary students in El Monte and South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers say the board balks at expelling violent students, which hurts the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lee Griffith, 36, an El Monte industrial engineering manager, said the 
district has lost teachers because of the violence. "We've had several 
incidents with weapons, one in which a kid brought two guns on campus and sold 
one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Hollopeter, 51, who is running for his fourth term, called the 
expulsion issue "much ado about nothing" and said students are suspended or 
expelled according to a board policy that allows officials to do so after other 
forms of discipline are unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin E. Wallach, 54, an El Monte marketing representative, also said 
discipline was a problem. "These kids get away with murder and the board won't 
expel anybody," he said. "I've coached Pony League baseball for 20 years and I 
know how to work with kids. Kids like discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Menard, 42, who was appointed to the board in June when another board 
member retired, denied that the board is soft on student violence and says the 
challengers lack familiarity with district procedures for expulsion. "You can't 
just expel a child without a hearing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Prado Jr., 48, who is running for his fourth term, cited his experience. 
"Over the past three terms we have improved math scores (and) built an 
elementary school, and I've been instrumental in getting these things 
accomplished," he said. Prado said teacher complaints about four recent 
incidents "have been blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Maria F. Avila, an El Monte compliance monitor; Georgino Caraveo, a retired 
South El Monte educator, and Juan J. Wing, a retired South El Monte engineering 
manager, couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Unified 
</P>
<P>
In the Pomona Unified School District, which has 32 schools and 26,000 
students, six candidates are competing for three seats with promises to try to 
improve test scores and ease crowding. The district serves the city of Pomona 
and the northern part of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Graves, 52, who resigned as the district's superintendent a year ago 
because of ill health, is seeking to return to education as a school board 
member. Graves, who is a diabetic, said his health has improved enough to 
permit him to carry out the duties of a board member. Graves came to Pomona as 
an administrator 10 years ago and served as superintendent for five years. "The 
thing that I brought to the district was a sense of stability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleve Holifield, 56, an engineer at General Dynamics Corp. and a member of the 
Diamond Bar Municipal Advisory Council before that community incorporated, said 
he believes the district should design a curriculum for each school that will 
meet the needs of children in that neighborhood. He said that parents, students 
and teachers must work together more closely and that officials must stop 
blaming the area's socioeconomic conditions for poor test scores. "That's been 
the excuse all these years," he said. "I think we need people (in office) who 
don't know you can't do better." 
</P>
<P>
Chaim Magnum, 39, said he believes that his Latino heritage and the obstacles 
he overcame to obtain an education are among his qualifications for the school 
board in a district whose students are mostly Latino and which has a high 
dropout rate. Magnum, oldest of 11 children, came to this country from Colombia 
when he was of high school age. He said he had no schooling between the second 
and ninth grades, yet he managed to graduate from college. He said one of the 
district's major problems is crowding: Thirty-two to 40 children in a classroom 
is "conducive to good education." 
</P>
<P>
Candelario J. (Cande) Mendoza, 70, publisher of the bilingual newspaper La Voz, 
seeks to regain a school board seat he gave up in 1981. Mendoza said he quit 
the board after one term in order to start the newspaper, but now "I've got 
things in pretty good shape," and would have time to both operate the paper and 
serve on the board. Mendoza said one of his major assets is his experience, 39 
years in education in roles from teacher to deputy superintendent to school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
Linda M. Stevens, a business owner and former teacher, is the only incumbent 
seeking reelection. Stevens said the district needs five new schools and must 
work to improve academic achievement. She noted that the district's new 
superintendent has developed a plan for raising test scores. She said she wants 
another term to work on scholastic achievement, to solve the student housing 
problem, to implement the middle school plan and to upgrade the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Linda D. Wright, 41, ran for the school board two years ago and lost by just 18 
votes. She is running this year with the endorsement of the teachers union and 
of the union representing clerical staff, maintenance workers and other 
employees. The unions also have endorsed Graves and Magnum. Wright is an 
investigator with the Los Angeles County Children's Services Department and is 
a former special education teacher. She holds a master's degree in counseling. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh candidate, Robert S. Preece, an attorney, will appear on the ballot 
but has withdrawn from the race. His withdrawal came too late to have his name 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead 
</P>
<P>
The Rosemead School District has four elementary schools and one intermediate 
school that serve 2,800 children and employ 110 teachers. Three seats with 
four-year terms and one seat with a two-year term are up for grabs. The 
district encompasses parts of Rosemead, El Monte, Temple City and San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Marie Ortiz and James Trainor and challengers Karan Leon and Robert 
Harris are vying for four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Cantrell and Robert Kehne are running for the two-year term that 
resulted from Fred Mascorro's vacating his seat. Harris, 47, a grocery 
distribution clerk and Navy veteran, has lived in the San Gabriel Valley 37 
years and has lived in Rosemead four years. He attended Arcadia High School and 
has three children. 
</P>
<P>
Leon is a mother of six children, all of whom attended district schools. She 
and her husband run an investment management business. She also works part-time 
managing a Pasadena roofing business. Leon has lived in the district for 19 
years and has attended UCLA and Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, 44, a library assistant at East Los Angeles Library, has helped start a 
self-sustaining child-care program, institute a drug prevention program and 
purchase new textbooks during her term. A 19-year Rosemead resident, she holds 
a library technician certificate from Cal State Los Angeles and has three 
children, all of whom attended Rosemead district schools. She is running for 
her second term. 
</P>
<P>
Trainor, 48, has lived in Rosemead since 1965 and works as an account 
representative for AT&amp;T. Three of his four sons have gone through Rosemead 
School District schools. Originally from South Dakota, Trainor has taken 
business courses at Pasadena City College. Trainor is running for his first 
full term on the board after being elected to an uncompleted term two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cantrell, 37, is a technical analyst for Wells Fargo Bank and has lived in 
Rosemead since 1974. He is the father of five children, two of whom attend 
Rosemead School District schools. He has also been active in PTA and local 
school district advisory committees. Cantrell graduated from Bell High School 
and attended UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Kehne could not be reached for comment.

<P>
Rowland Unified 
</P>
<P>
Three incumbents and one challenger are facing off for three seats in the 
Rowland Unified School District, which serves 19,000 students in Rowland 
Heights, La Puente, West Covina and Walnut. Candidates are elected at large. 
</P>
<P>
Dean F. Anderson, 64, Rowland Heights, a board member since 1973, says he wants 
to design programs to challenge outstanding students. He says the district must 
also consider future trends in Rowland Heights. "We're beginning to get into a 
declining enrollment, and we need to plan for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolland M. Boceta, 43, West Covina, who is running for a second term, said he 
wants to uphold excellence. "I have supported strong student discipline and the 
prudent management of financial policies," said Boceta, a CPA whose firm does 
consulting work for other school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Leon, 25, a La Puente engineer, is the sole challenger. A graduate of 
Rowland Unified, Leon says he wants to improve the quality of education and 
stem the dropout rate. "There's a 29% dropout in grades 10-12 alone," Leon 
said. "We need to provide better counseling for student needs." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jo Maxwell, 49, Walnut, who is running for her second term, says she wants 
to address problems of drug and alcohol abuse. "I want to continue the 
substance-abuse education provided in all classes," she said. "We need to 
provide a positive environment to learn in and safe campuses for our students." 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel 
</P>
<P>
In marked contrast to the hotly contested 1985 school board election, four 
candidates are competing for three seats in a quiet San Gabriel School District 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which has 3,223 students, serves most of San Gabriel and parts of 
San Marino, Alhambra and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur W. Langdale, 73, a retired firefighter,said he is interested in 
attacking the drug problem facing teen-agers. "I'd like to see parents take 
more interest in the schools, like my mother did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic Shambra, 50, an administrator in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, is seeking his fifth four-year term. Anticipating a number of teacher 
retirements next year, Shambra said he would like the board to keep salary 
levels competitive in order to attract new teachers. Shambra said he is proud 
that four years ago the board "brought peace to the district" by hiring a new 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Nancy H. Trask, who declined to give her age, is running for her 
first full term. A retired social worker, she was appointed to the board last 
year after the death of Linda Jorgensen. Trask said she would like to add more 
music classes to the curriculum. 
</P>

candidate's form, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Unified 
</P>
<P>

With three incumbents choosing not to run for the South Pasadena Board of 
Education, voters will have an opportunity to select a majority of the 
five-member body on Tuesday. The district has 3,500 students at five schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight candidates, only David L. Margrave -- who served four years on the 
South Pasadena City Council -- has run for public office before. Last fall, 
teachers went on strike, and in June voters narrowly defeated a school-tax 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Bybee-Dane, 41, regional director for business development of a national 
construction company. "I have both a creative background and a strong business 
background. My aim is to bring business sense to the table. In the past I've 
been a documentary film maker and playwright. So I also understand the creative 
nature of education."

Alice Hwang, 39, who lists her occupation as parent and educational advocate. 
"The most important issue is the lack of harmony in our school district -- the 
polarization among the teachers, the parents and the administration." 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Rose, 41, paralegal. "Our district is suffering from complacency. We 
don't want to face the cold, hard facts that some students are slipping in 
performance on standardized tests. We have to find other ways of financing our 
district, and I've identified some of those ways." 
</P>
<P>
David Margrave, 41, air-conditioning and plumbing contractor, and twice mayor 
pro tem while on the council from 1983 through 1986. "The school board could 
use a business person's approach. I could add that. We have quality teachers. 
We just don't have enough. The facilities are a mess. They've been left to 
crumble for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Martinez-Miller, 45, elementary school principal, Magnolia Elementary 
School in Los Angeles. "I'm concerned about the financial stress the district 
is under, but I do not believe that is the district's only problem." A key 
problem, she said, is the perception of a lack trust among all sectors of the 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Mickaelian Jr., 56, public relations consultant. "There needs to be more 
effective financial planning," adding that a lack of funding has contributed to 
a decline in the educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Seth S. Sandberg, 49, principal at Sierra Vista Elementary School in El Sereno. 
"There needs to be a board member with a little more knowledge, a little more 
commitment and a little more experience. I have that." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Vida Spence, 46, psychiatrist. "We have a chronic situation of financial 
distress and we have to find some way of dealing with it. Teacher morale is 
very, very low right now. The absence of a constructive, participatory working 
environment is a key issue." 
</P>
<P>
Temple City Unified 
</P>
<P>
A four-way race in the Temple City Unified School District is highlighted by 
struggles over a teachers' contract and the aftermath of a recently failed 
attempt to recall two school board members. The district, which has 4,326 
students, serves Temple City and parts of Arcadia and San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Ted McNevin, 43, principal of Goddard Middle School in Glendora, helped lead 
the recall campaign against board members John Gera and Lewis Moulton. McNevin 
said he believes the board's unwillingness to negotiate fairly has created a 
rift with employees. "One of my goals would be to heal that division," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda L. Miller, 42, elected two years ago to complete the unexpired term of 
the late Nancy Cash, said she wants to improve the board's relationship with 
employees and hopes the district will use some of its reserve money to update 
computers for students and install air conditioners in some schools. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Norman, who is seeking her sixth term and declined to give her age, 
said she stands by her record. On contract negotiations, she said, "I want the 
district to pay (teachers) as well as they can afford to pay and stay 
financially solvent." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Palmer, 41, chairman of the math department at Muscatel Junior High 
School in Rosemead, said he did not support the recall campaign, which he said 
would have been too expensive, but would like to "see periodic meetings between 
the employee groups and the school board." 
</P>
<P>
Valle Lindo 
</P>
<P>
Three incumbents and one challenger are running for three seats on the Valle 
Lindo school board, which serves 1,120 students in portions of South El Monte.

</P>
<P>
Joe Jauregui, 49, an accountant, also running for a third term. "For the last 
two terms I've emphasized discipline. We are trying to make this a better place 
for children to learn. I stress the three R's," Jauregui said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Marie Arrieta. The third incumbent running, she is a library services 
volunteer and homemaker. 
</P>

SCOPE: COMPTON POET WEAVES LYRICAL STORIES OF "AFRICAN VOICES SHARPENED ON

<P>
 -- KAMAU DAA'OOD 
</P>
<P>
"Watermelon, Drum and Ink" 
</P>
<P>
In a traditional African culture, Kamau Daa'ood would be a griot, a 
storyteller, a keeper of the tribe's history and myths who uses words, song and 
dance to tell his stories. 
</P>
<P>
In 20th-Century America, Daa'ood is a word musician, a poet who uses artistic 
mediums from music to videos to tell stories about himself and other black 
Americans -- their "African voices sharpened on concrete" in the nation's 
gritty urban landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are about people like Arthur, a musician friend celebrated in one 
poem, who "moistened his reed with tears he collected" and did not speak 
English, "just pig Latin and fluent saxophone and a little Spanish he learned 
from his neighbors" in the housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are about "young minds bleeding naked in front of snot-covered 
TVs," about "precision lobotomies executed at ends of ghetto blasters," and 
about "a slow suicide that stretches out over a life span." 
</P>
<P>
Daa'ood, who is 39 and a Compton resident, began his writing career in the Los 
Angeles public schools. For more than two decades he has pursued a full-time 
artistic career that has produced two books of poetry and more than 400 
readings, one as far away as Somalia, where in 1979 he performed at the 
national theater. 
</P>
<P>
This year he has received a number of accolades, among them a teaching grant 
from the state Arts Council. Last month he was named the best poet-performer by 
L.A. Weekly, which said he "fuses the dialectics of jazz with the oratorical 
powers of gospel and cosmic social satire." 
</P>
<P>
A video that mixes one of his longer poems with music was included last month 
in "Songs of the City," the "Take Five: Arts and Culture" series broadcast on 
public television station KCET. The poetry and music presentation was given 
against a video backdrop of lively city street scenes. Daa'ood hopes to produce 
more of his work on video and have it distributed through schools and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
. . . There are wonderful things 
</P>
<P>
written on the scar tissue of my heart 
</P>
<P>
and i've come to tell the bare butt truth . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Daa'ood's poetry mixes the harsh realities of inner-city life -- the "savage 
red streets," the babies who grow up to "harm you" -- with the joy of living 
and the echoes of the agrarian, tribal culture that nurtured his African 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
In a love poem to his wife, for example, he writes of, "purple blossoms, blown 
through a bamboo kiss, sailing on a rainbow river drum" to a woman "reading 
leaves and cowries, talking to ancestors and singing ancient songs." The couple 
have five children, ranging in age from 8 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago the poet adopted the African names Kamau, which means quiet 
warrior, and Daa'ood, which means beloved. A native of Los Angeles, he was 
still in his teens when he joined the Watts Towers Writers Workshop, where 
older black writers such as Ojenki, K. Curtis Lyle and Quincy Troupe taught and 
served as role models. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he worked with the Pan-African People's Arkestra, the group of musicians 
who came together under the leadership of Los Angeles pianist-composer Horace 
Tapscott to build an orchestra that would preserve and promote the works of 
black composers. It was while he was with the Arkestra that Daa'ood became 
known as the "word musician," creating a poetic form that he recites with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Daa'ood works part time on programming for the Watts Towers Arts Center and is 
also a full-time outreach supervisor for an AIDS education program at the 
Southern California Youth and Family Center in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
. . . The essence of the work is healing 
</P>
<P>
rebuilding a circle 
</P>
<P>
promoting the life force . . . 
</P>
<P>
uniting the scars to make something beautiful . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The arts, Daa'ood suggests, are a way in which black people can come to terms 
with the bleak lives they have often been forced to bear since being captured 
two centuries ago and thrown onto ships bound for American slave markets. 
Creativity, he suggests in one of his poems, is "a martial dance in the midst 
of despair." 
</P>
<P>
Tall, bearded and bespectacled, with a voice as sonorous as it is gentle, 
Daa'ood calls himself "a community arts activist or a grass-roots cultural 
worker." 
</P>
<P>
He and drummer Billy Higgins are transforming a storefront in Los Angeles' 
Crenshaw District into a performance space that they hope to open within a 
month. Dubbed the World Stage, the space will give the Southland's black 
artists a place to perform at the same time they are preserving elements of 
black culture, be it in jazz, poetry or dance. 
</P>
<P>
"This place that I'm building here," Daa'ood said, "I'm not just building for 
myself. I'm building it as a vehicle for other creative people, and for the 
community, a place where they can come together. There's not a lot of outlets 
for creative people." 
</P>
<P>
. . . This is an army of healers 
</P>
<P>
physician, heal thyself 
</P>
<P>
and radiate, and radiate, and radiate . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If black people are to overcome some of the destructive conditions under which 
they live, it is critical, Daa'ood says, that they have a sense of cultural 
identity. Problems afflicting blacks in America today, he said, can be traced 
in part to the historical fact that they were stripped of their language, their 
religion, their national identity, that they "don't know where their 
great-great-great-grandfather came from" and that as slaves they were turned 
into "property." 
</P>
<P>
When your culture has "totally been annihilated and you can't look back, you're 
just stuck with the moment, no anchor, nor roots to your tree. I don't like 
that word (roots). I think it's overused today, but I think that's why so much 
of my work speaks to" overcoming the loss. "That's part of the healing that 
needs to take place in the . . . historical amnesia that we are faced with." 
</P>
<P>
Don't look to Daa'ood, though, to don a dashiki, as many black American men did 
as they began to explore their African heritage. "That's very superficial," 
said the poet. "We're not talking about dashikis. We're talking about family 
structure, we're talking about ways of doing things. We're talking about the 
connectedness of a people, the feeling of being responsible, the extended 
concept of self."

stations in cooperation with the ABC Unified School District and the 
surrounding cities, said Donn Irving, commission project director.

<P>
CEREMONY TO MARK START OF $41-MILLION ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 400 guests have been invited to a ceremony Saturday to mark the start of 
construction on the $41-million Community Arts Center being built by Cerritos 
in its newest redevelopment area alongside the 91 Freeway at Bloomfield Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The 125,000-square-foot glass and granite edifice in the Towne Center 
redevelopment site will take three years to complete. Billed as the ultimate in 
high-tech, multipurpose buildings, the Arts Center will have movable walls, 
seats and stages so that it can accommodate everything from a senior citizen 
luncheon to a symphony orchestra performance. 
</P>
<P>
It is the most expensive public building Cerritos has ever built. The 
contractor is Continental Heller Corp. of Long Beach. The architects are Barton 
Myers Associates of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Music, food and entertainment will be featured at the festivities, which will 
begin at 11:30 a.m. In addition to the Arts Center, the city will dedicate the 
new interior streets in the Towne Center development and the freeway off-ramp 
that leads into the area.

TEACHERS PICKET EL RANCHO DISTRICT FOR 10% PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 teachers and counselors picketed outside the El Rancho Unified 
School District offices in Pico Rivera after classes earlier this week to 
pressure officials for a pay increase and better health benefits. Teachers are 
asking for 10% pay increases this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
The district is offering a 4.64% boost for one year and is seeking to impose a 
teacher discipline policy. District negotiator John Sherman said, "Teachers 
have different things that they are requesting and the district is analyzing 
the budget to see how far they can go to meet the teachers' request." 
</P>
<P>
Another negotiating session is scheduled for Friday.

<P>
EDUCATION: QUESTIONS ABOUT SUPT. CESARE CALDARELLI'S PAST HAVE DOMINATED A RACE 
THAT, SOME SAY, HAS MORE AT STAKE FOR THE DISTRICT.

<P>
Against a backdrop of bitter teacher contract negotiations and public confusion 
over the district's long-term plans, four challengers and three incumbents are 
running for three seats on the Ventura Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the three at-large seats in Tuesday's election are incumbents Judy 
Alexandre, May Lee Berry and Terence M. Kilbride, and challengers Judee Hauer, 
Philip O'Rourke, John Walker and Ronald Wong. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, administrators of the 15,000-student, 26-school district have 
wrestled with long-range planning, stalled contract negotiations and 
revelations of past job troubles involving district Supt. Cesare Caldarelli. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators and the district's 650 teachers have engaged in angry exchanges 
in the wake of the June expiration of the teachers' three-year contract. They 
have also been at loggerheads over a complex and potentially expensive 
long-range planning proposal dubbed "Vision 2000." 
</P>
<P>
The September debut of Vision 2000 was followed by disclosures that Caldarelli 
had encountered serious opposition as superintendent of the Martinez Unified 
School District, including a no-confidence vote from district teachers. 
Caldarelli's decisions, which were supported by the Martinez school board, 
forced unplanned layoffs, according to some Martinez school officials. 
</P>
<P>
But during his tenure, student test scores rose, the district approved a 
$25-million bond issue to renovate schools, and it instituted child-care and 
optional kindergarten programs. Caldarelli served as superintendent of 
Martinez, a small town northeast of San Francisco, from 1983 until he was hired 
in Ventura in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Several candidates said these issues have been overblown and misinterpreted, 
obscuring district successes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of amazed that we've drawn this many candidates into the race 
because I think things have been running reasonably well in the district," 
Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride, a Ventura County deputy district attorney who has served on the board 
since 1980, said an effective district curriculum has resulted in student test 
scores that are "way up." He cited the 11 schools selected by the state 
Department of Education as "distinguished schools" as evidence that the 
district is "going fabulously." 
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by district officials, CAP scores for 
12th-graders went up in most categories from 1987 to 1988. However, at the 
elementary level, there was a general decline in CAP scores over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride, along with Alexandre and Berry, acknowledge that the district faces 
problems, including the teachers' unresolved contract, escalating retiree 
benefits and management turnover. 
</P>
<P>
But all three stressed improvements in the curriculum, as well as an increase 
in year-round education. They also pointed to greater attempts to involve the 
public in district decision making through budget, curriculum and parent 
advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, the only sticking point that I can see right now in the district are 
the salary negotiations," Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one challenger agreed that the district is operating smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe we have a good school district," said Wong, 58, a retired 
Navy officer and first-time candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Wong, who is PTA president at Ventura High School and has held similar posts at 
other schools, said the public has been misled by media reports of the 
district's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's perception is really off base right now because of how things 
have been reported," said Wong, adding that he was saddened and distressed by 
the turmoil created by Vision 2000. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-point proposal for guiding the district into the next century, Vision 2000 
has been criticized as being vague and poorly timed. The proposal, which 
touches on areas ranging from new teacher salary formulas to employee day care, 
drew immediate anger from teacher representatives. Teachers complained that 
they had no input and accused district administrators of circumventing the 
salary negotiation process by taking grandiose schemes directly to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Vision 2000 proponents say that the plan is simply a set of suggestions and 
that both teachers and the public will have a say in the development of firm 
policies. Several public forums to discuss it have already been held. 
</P>
<P>
Though the din surrounding Vision 2000 has subsided, Hauer said both the 
handling of the plan and the hiring of Caldarelli are symptoms of a school 
board "that may not question as much as they should." 
</P>
<P>
"I think what I'm sensing is a board that's not as thorough as it should be," 
Hauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hauer, 43, a real estate broker who is a first-time candidate for the board, 
also said board members were skimming over district problems, including 
declining CAP scores and an alarming high school dropout rate. According to 
figures released by the state in June, about 13% of Ventura's high school 
students drop out between their sophomore year and graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to look at more than anything else are programs that are 
educationally sound," Hauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although school board members say the board is enlisting teacher and public 
input, several challengers say both groups need to become more involved in 
district decision making. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 42, a general manager for GTE, characterized district management as "a 
top-down approach." 
</P>
<P>
"Those that are closest to the classroom and what's going on in education 
should be in a much stronger position in determining how monies are spent," 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Walker said he would push for an increase in "school site 
management," a program that would eventually allow teachers and parents a 
greater say in school issues. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke, 44, a salesman, also said teachers' concerns were being neglected, 
fostering low morale among school employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people that work for the district are not happy," O'Rourke said. 
"Their concerns are not being heard, or they're not being acted on by the 
present board." 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke also criticized the board for a "sorely lacking coordinated effort" to 
combat rising drug and gang problems. District officials disagreed with 
O'Rourke's contention that drug-intervention programs at the district's two 
high schools were inadequate, citing drug programs at both. 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating a concern expressed by many candidates, O'Rourke said he was also 
worried about the escalating cost of retiree benefits, which he said "has the 
potential to bankrupt the district." 
</P>
<P>
Under a program adopted in 1975, district employees who serve 10 years or more 
continue to receive medical benefits for themselves and their dependents after 
they retire, a package that could cost the district an estimated $1.8 million 
for 1989-90. The money is drawn out of operational funds, monies also used to 
pay for school maintenance and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
District officials set aside $500,000 this year to begin building a retiree 
benefit reserve. However, O'Rourke said the reserve "is something we should 
have handled years ago." 
</P>
<P>
In the face of dwindling discretionary funds, innovative efforts by both the 
schools and the community can help pick up some of the slack, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Wong's proposals is an effort to clamp down on gangs and drugs through a 
consortium of youth organizations such as the Little League and the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"All we hear about are the bad gangs, but we should consider that the 
alternatives are the good gangs," Wong said. "How can we work together to get 
our kids to join the good groups?" 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Wong said he would also propose adding a seventh period to the high 
school day. The activities period would allow students to take electives 
ranging from drama to academic decathlon. It could be added to the schedule at 
no extra cost by taking small increments of time from the other classes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandre also proposed expanding course offerings. Alexandre, a counselor and 
licensed social worker who has served on the school board for four years, said 
that despite financial constraints, students could have a wide course selection 
through clustering of schools. Under this system, students would be able to 
choose from several schools on the basis of electives they offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic curriculum at all the schools would be the same, but extra 
enrichment would be available in particular areas, say fine arts, humanities or 
science and technology," she said. "As a district, we may not be able to afford 
a music/drama teacher at every school in the district, but we might be able to 
afford four or five." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandre also defended Caldarelli and the school board's decision to hire him. 
She acknowledged that Caldarelli had made some mistakes in Martinez, but said 
the board carefully weighed his record before hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, 45, an event and meeting planner running for her third term, said one of 
her main concerns is reducing class size. 
</P>
<P>
Under their old contract, teachers have a say in class size. Reducing class 
size means hiring more teachers, a move teachers have traditionally resisted 
because limited salary funds then have to be split between more teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Berry also said the board has worked hard to include public input in the 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
"The board is trying to allow the public to become part of the process. . . ," 
Berry said. "It's the taxpayers' money that we're talking about."

PICK OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
The Friends of the Pomona Public Library will sponsor a 100th birthday party 
for Goddess Pomona, the Roman marble statue presented to the city in 1889 by 
the Rev. C. F. Loop, a pioneer horticulturist in the Pomona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration will be from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday at the library, 625 S. Garey 
Ave., site of the 5-foot-tall statue. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the statue, left, is Vanessa Chatigny, 14. 
</P>
<P>
In 1888 Loop was visiting the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, when he saw 
the original statue, which had been unearthed from among the ruined temples and 
palaces of the Mediterranean, where it had lain buried for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Since Loop's hometown was named after the goddess, he decided to have the 
figure copied, and contracted with Italian sculptor Adolph Cipriani to make a 
replica. The cost of the replica, including transportation to Pomona, was 
$10,000.

<P>
41 ILLEGAL ALIENS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 41 illegal immigrants in Malibu and Topanga 
last week, agent Mike Molloy of the agency's Oxnard office said. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said the arrests occurred during an early morning sweep last Tuesday of 
places where day laborers congregate along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
He said most of the arrests took place in Malibu. "We lost quite a few at 
Topanga who ran into the rugged terrain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol, which has six officers assigned to Oxnard, staged the raid 
at the request of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and officials of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said the raid was in response to complaints from Topanga residents and 
others that some illegal immigrants who work as day laborers in the area have 
set up primitive camps in the Santa Monica Mountains that pose a fire danger.

ANGRY LIBRARY USERS WIN REVERSAL OF CUTBACK IN HOURS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGETS: COUNTY SUPERVISORS HAVE VOTED TO SPEND THE ENTIRE LIBRARY CONTINGENCY 
FUND OF $318,000 AND AUTHORIZED 10 NEW POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disgruntled library patrons in Ventura County won a victory this week when 
county supervisors reversed themselves and voted to reopen library doors four 
nights a week and on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 8, libraries in Ventura, Simi Valley, Camarillo, Port Hueneme 
and Ojai will expand their hours from two nights per week to four, and library 
hours in Fillmore and Moorpark will be increased from two to three nights per 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Foster Library in Ventura and the Camarillo, Simi Valley, Port 
Hueneme and Ojai libraries will reopen from 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays beginning March 
4. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Oxnard and Thousand Oaks operate their own libraries. Santa 
Paula's library is privately run. 
</P>
<P>
Using the entire library contingency fund of $318,000, the supervisors funded 
nine new positions for librarians and clerks, as well as a 10th slot for a 
coordinator to supervise the system's 575 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Students were the big evening users and, together with their parents and 
teachers, became the most vocal complainers when the hours were cut Sept. 5, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't reopen to this group of people, we're really not doing our job," 
Supervisor James R. Dougherty argued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have the most expensive computer system in the world and the 
nicest-looking library in the world, and it isn't going to do you any good at 
all if the doors are shut." 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after hundreds of complaints from library clients, Library 
Services Director Dixie D. Adeniran said. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard over the telephone, through the mail, by people who pulled on my 
sleeve at public meetings," she said. "The most serious concern was weekday 
evenings." 
</P>
<P>
The cuts became necessary after supervisors decided on a $9-million budget for 
library systems in July. At that time, the board funded a new computer system 
for $1.6 million, but denied Adeniran's request for an additional $1.2 million 
for staffing to handle increased business at the system's 17 branches. 
</P>
<P>
The $318,000 taken from the contingency fund set aside for emergencies will 
finance the 10 positions for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the minimum level of funding needed to open the doors," she said. 
"Even at this, we are still fairly severely understaffed." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, she said, she welcomed a review now under way by the county 
administrator's office. 
</P>
<P>
The review, which is to be finished in two months, may recommend staffing 
alterations or other methods to work within the budget constraints, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteer coordinator will supervise the unpaid aides, write grants and 
plan fund-raisers. Adeniran and Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer called the 
position "money well spent." 
</P>
<P>
Adeniran said she expected the board to continue to fund the library at its 
restored hours in future years. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors made the unanimous decision -- a four-fifths vote was required to 
take money from the contingency fund -- over the objections of County 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg, who urged the board to delay action 
until his office completes its review. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that we're going to be in a situation where we're going to be 
really hurting . . . where your board is going to be stretched again," 
Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours effective Jan. 8 at Foster and Wright libraries in Ventura, and in 
Camarillo, Simi Valley, Ojai and Port Hueneme will be from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Mondays through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
Presently, the branches close at 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. On March 
4, all the branches except Wright will open from 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Hours effective Jan. 8 at Ojai, Moorpark and Fillmore will be from 10 a.m. to 9 
p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, and 
noon to 6 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The three are now open from noon to 9 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays, 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, and noon to 5 p.m. Saturdays.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;

<P>
JOB PREFERENCE PACT STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's First Source Agreement, an unusual proposal that would require 
developers and their building tenants -- both commercial and residential -- to 
interview Pasadena residents first for job openings, will be scrutinized by a 
subcommittee of the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a subcommittee arose earlier this week after several board members 
balked at adopting the proposal. The agreement's requirements for 
record-keeping and inspections by city officials might discourage developers 
from building in Pasadena, said Mayor William Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
Similar concerns were expressed by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, which 
called the agreement punitive and questioned its constitutionality and 
legality. 
</P>
<P>
The First Source Agreement previously applied to major projects in the city. It 
was modified and made part of the requirements for developers who qualify to 
build under the city's restrictive growth management initiative. The initiative 
was passed by voters in March.

3 WATER DISTRICTS HAVE CONTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Candidates running for water district boards in the San Gabriel Valley describe 
the job as something akin to dogcatcher: Not many people want the post, but 
it's an important public service required to keep community life -- and water 
-- flowing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, only three districts in the San Gabriel Valley are holding contested 
elections, and there is little controversy being generated by the 10 candidates 
in Pasadena's Kinneloa Irrigation District, the La Puente Valley County Water 
District and the Walnut Valley Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the Valley County Water District, where water pollution over the years 
has forced the closure of five of 10 wells, the three seats are uncontested. 
Arnold P. Hepner, Merrill F. Whitley and Clinton O. Nixon will be the new board 
members for the water district, which is headquartered in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the Walnut Valley race, three Diamond Bar men are trying to unseat Richard 
C. Engdahl, who is the appointed incumbent on the board. The district serves 
nearly 25,000 residential, industrial and business customers throughout the 
eastern San Gabriel Valley. Opposing Engdahl are Philip G. Crocker, Eric R. 
Stone and John T. Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates are seeking three seats in the La Puente district. Incumbents 
Martin Larraya , Lawrence J. Mayo and Carl L. Spear are faced by challenger 
Robert W. Fallon. 
</P>
<P>
The one contested seat in the Kinneloa district involves Melvin L. Matthews 
running against Russell D. Shattuck. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is appointing 14 candidates who 
were unopposed in their bids for seats on six San Gabriel Valley water boards, 
including Hepner, Whitley and Nixon of the Valley County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rowland Water District, appointees are Louis N. Yorba, John A. Rowland, 
Melvin I. Harper and Antonio Diliberti. In the San Gabriel County Water 
District, appointees are Everette M. Kokanour, Frank E. Seward, Wellington H. 
Love and Kenneth W. Bauchman. In the Kinneloa Irrigation District, the 
appointees are Charles F. Briscoe and Amy Walton Brown, and from Walnut Valley, 
Edward N. Layton.

VENTURA CAMPUS OF CSUN HALTS SPRING ENROLLMENT IN 7 PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its 15-year history, the University Center, now the 
Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, closed enrollment Nov. 1 in seven of 
its degree programs for next year's spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
Students seeking classes in Chicano studies, liberal studies, English, history, 
teaching credential programs and an administrative services credential are 
being told to apply for entry to the fall, 1990, semester. At that time, the 
center's enrollment cap will be expanded and more classrooms will be available. 
</P>
<P>
"The need is here and we have people that are just not being served," said 
campus director Joyce Kennedy. "We have hundreds of people on our waiting 
lists."

The campus serves about 1,000 mostly part-time students. That translates to the 
equivalent of 349 full-time students, or 24 more than the 325 enrollment cap. 
</P>
<P>
For the fall semester of 1990, the top enrollment will be 450. In addition to 
bachelor's degrees in areas ranging from public health to public 
administration, campus officials are deciding whether to add a journalism 
degree, Kennedy said.

SALE OF CITY LOTS MAY PROVIDE PARKING IN VENICE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COUNCILWOMAN RUTH GALANTER WANTS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM A LAND 
AUCTION TO BENEFIT THE VENICE BEACHFRONT; TWO OTHER COUNCILWOMEN WOULD LIKE 
THEIR DISTRICTS TO GET SOME OF THE PROFITS.

Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter hopes to solve Venice's chronic parking 
shortage by selling more than a dozen residential lots that the city has 
collected over the past 40 years and using the money to build parking lots in 
the popular beachfront community. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed this week to sell five of the parcels at auction next 
month. City officials said about a dozen others are expected to come up for 
sale soon. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sales will go into a special account set up by Galanter's 
predecessor, former Councilwoman Pat Russell, that is paying for a new parking 
lot on a railroad right of way near the intersection of Electric Avenue and 
Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bickhart, Galanter's legislative deputy, said the councilwoman hopes to use 
money from the December auction to buy several lots along the Venice Boulevard 
median between Pacific and Dell avenues to enlarge a beach parking lot there. 
Some of the money may also be used for other projects, such as sidewalk 
improvements along the Venice canals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The five tiny, irregularly shaped lots -- the largest is 3,088 square feet -- 
are worth about $300,000 each because of the scarcity of vacant land in the 
neighborhood south of the Venice Pier and west of Marina del Rey, city 
officials said. Most of the lots were purchased from the county in the 1940s 
and 1950s, when the city hoped to collect enough of them to create parks, 
parking lots and other city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is stuff that people considered junk and wouldn't pay their taxes on," 
said Donald Molony, senior real estate officer with the city's Bureau of 
Engineering. "But they were scattered for the most part. Now they essentially 
are being converted in such a way that they will still be used for public 
purposes in Venice." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter spokesman Rick Ruiz said the city has determined that the parcels are 
too small for other uses -- such as low-income housing -- and that there is no 
other way to pay for new parking lots in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the budget situation is the way it is, there is not enough money to go 
around," said Ruiz. "So we can use this money to fund projects that wouldn't 
get funded from other means." 
</P>
<P>
Although the council Tuesday unanimously approved Galanter's request to sell 
the first five properties, the vote had been postponed from late September 
because of objections raised by two council members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who heads the council's housing committee, was 
concerned that the city did not try hard enough to find ways to use the land 
for affordable housing. Molina later dropped her opposition after she held a 
committee hearing on the issue and questioned representatives from various city 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting in late September, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores 
complained about the special Venice account, which contains about $1 million 
and is the only one of its kind in the city. Flores said money from the 
December auction should go into the city's general fund for citywide uses since 
the parcels are owned by the city, not the community of Venice. Galanter has 
argued that Venice's parking problems are citywide problems because beach 
visitors come from throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any special circumstances in one district that aren't prevalent in 
others as well," Flores said in an interview. "I don't want to be vindictive 
against her district, but I have so many needs in the Watts area that I can't 
afford to fulfill through the normal channels that I could use this kind of 
arrangement, too." 
</P>
<P>
Flores voted for the December auction Tuesday, but only after introducing a 
motion of her own that would establish a similar account for Watts. Flores said 
that if the council refuses to create the Watts account, "it will be time to 
discuss whether we should be doing this at all." 
</P>
<P>
The auction will be held Dec. 16 at 1 p.m. in Room 350 at City Hall. The 
following properties will be for sale: 3319 Grand Canal (2,700 square feet, 
minimum bid of $298,000); 3413 Grand Canal (2,160 square feet, $265,000); 3515 
Grand Canal (3,088 square feet, $305,000); 119 Eastwind St. (2,629 square feet, 
$280,000); and 28 Driftwood Street (2,888 square feet, $295,000). 
</P>
<P>
City officials said state coastal building requirements and temporary city 
restrictions in Venice limit development on the properties to single-family 
homes or duplexes.

A STRANGER IN PARADISE NO LONGER;

<P>
FOOTBALL: AFTER GIVING UP ON HAWAII, SEAN HAMPTON GIVES GLENDALE COLLEGE A 
LIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sean Hampton did not spend enough time in Hawaii to learn every local custom 
and expression, but like most visitors to the islands, he did become familiar 
with the word aloha. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, in fact, was subjected to the traditional expression of greeting and 
farewell more often than he cares remembering. 
</P>
<P>
"Aloha, Sean," Hampton heard upon his arrival at the University of Hawaii in 
August of 1987, a few months after the standout running back graduated from 
Sylmar High. 
</P>
<P>
"Aloha, Sean," Hawaii's football coaching staff said when Hampton, unhappy at 
being moved to receiver, left the Rainbow program after just one month and 
transferred to Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
"Aloha, Sean," they said when Hampton returned to Hawaii last January after 
rushing for more than 1,000 yards for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"Aloha, Sean," they said for the last time when Hampton, who had been moved to 
defensive back, returned to Glendale a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
Having never played a down for the Rainbows, Hampton has not appeared on the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s rushing list. But with his hops between 
the mainland and the islands, he might lead the nation in frequent-flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is a flight attendant, so those trips weren't a lot of money," 
Hampton says. "That's the one good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, 20, has derived other benefits from his travels. He said the time 
spent coming and going helped him mature and gain perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more focused on just getting my bachelor's degree," said Hampton, a 
5-foot, 10-inch, 190-pound sophomore. "If football works out, it works out." 
</P>
<P>
Should Hampton continue performing at his current level, things figure to work 
out well for both himself and the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday against Harbor, Hampton rushed for a game-high 146 yards as 
Glendale produced 615 yards of total offense in a 62-26 rout. 
</P>
<P>
The victory set the stage for this Saturday's showdown between Glendale (4-2-1 
overall, 3-1-1 in conference play) and Moorpark (6-1, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
This season, Hampton has rushed for 537 yards while rotating with sophomore 
Doug Dragomer (398 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"I can't complain because the offense is doing great," Hampton said. "Sometimes 
you don't want to get taken out, but that's how it is." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, who runs with a punishing style, never envisioned playing at a junior 
college when he was running roughshod over defenses at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing four games because of a collarbone injury and bruised ribs his 
senior year, Hawaii and the University of New Mexico offered Hampton 
scholarships based on his performance as a junior, when he rushed for more than 
1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a choice between the idyllic beaches of Oahu and the rugged 
landscape surrounding Albuquerque, Hampton opted for the islands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty easy choice," Hampton recalls. But not, as it turned out, the 
right one. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Hampton discovered that the Rainbows were dropping the 
tailback-dominated I formation for a run-and-shoot offense, which highlights 
the quarterback. Hampton was moved to slotback. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, he decided to move out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault, I should have checked the offense they ran," Hampton says. 
"And when I look back on it, I don't think I was ready to go to a university." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton returned to Southern California and Glendale, where his cousins, 
defensive back Michael Hampton and linebacker Tony France, were freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I could compete anymore because sitting out a year is hard," 
Hampton said. "You lose that edge." 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start in preseason workouts, however, Hampton became one of the 
top performers for a Vaquero team that went 10-2 and won the Western State 
Conference Bowl last season. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton's 1,150 yards rushing was the fourth-best single-season total in 
Glendale history, dating to 1928. He was named All-Western State Conference and 
second-team all-state, drawing interest, once again, from across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaii called and said they weren't going to pass as much, that the offense 
was going to be more centered around the backs," Hampton said. "It sounded 
good. Also, my cousins were leaving Glendale. I think I felt pressure to leave 
because they were." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale coaching staff did not dissuade Hampton from transferring. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him, 'This is probably a good decision because who knows what kind of 
season you're going to have next year,' " Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Things appeared to be going smoothly after Hampton returned to Hawaii for the 
start of the spring semester. He worked out at fullback and slotback and was 
the starter at tailback in short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
But when one of the Rainbows' reserve cornerbacks went down with an injury, 
Hampton was moved to defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to run the ball," said Hampton, who transferred back to Glendale 
and took nine units during the spring and 12 units during the summer to retain 
his eligibility. "I've changed my outlook about going to a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what school I go to -- big or small -- as long as I get to run 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton will get the opportunity Saturday against a Moorpark team that leads 
the state in defense, allowing just 170.7 a game. 
</P>
<P>
After that game, the Vaqueros complete their regular-season schedule with games 
against Santa Barbara and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
After the season, Hampton is likely to receive scholarship offers from several 
schools. He is not certain which school he will ultimately attend, but he knows 
it will not be one on an island. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm through with Hawaii," Hampton said with a smile. "Well, I'd go back there 
for vacation."

OFFICIALS PREDICT BOOMING TIMES FOR CRENSHAW AREA IN 21ST CENTURY; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A SEMINAR GIVES RESIDENTS A GLIMPSE OF THE POSSIBILITIES THAT 
EXIST WITH THE DISTRICT'S IDEAL LOCATION AND MORE AFFORDABLE REAL ESTATE. 
</P>

The Crenshaw district, a primarily black community located between downtown Los 
Angeles and the airport, may become the next century's boom town as real estate 
and home hunters discover its bargains, according to government and business 
officials meeting on the area's future. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw 2000, sponsored by the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter's office, was held Saturday at Dublin Avenue School to provide 
residents a picture of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Crenshaw is in the path of a megatrend -- the continuing expansion of downtown 
on one side and LAX on the other," Rubell Helgeson, a deputy planner in 
Galanter's office, told about 100 residents. She was one of a dozen speakers 
from local government, banks and community affairs groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Smothers, president of the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce, points out that 
the community's proximity to the Coliseum, Hollywood, downtown and the Wilshire 
district will mean less stress for commuting workers. In addition, he said, 
Crenshaw offers relief from "outrageous" office and housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses operating on the Westside, Smothers said, "could do it just as well 
a mile east" in the Crenshaw district. He predicts that property bargains will 
entice bankers, architects and other white-collar industries to relocate to 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
If the area's commercial success hangs on one factor, it is the Crenshaw 
Shopping Center, built in 1947 as one of the West Coast's first malls and 
renovated and reopened as the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza in 1988, said 
Richard Benbow, an administrator at the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, if the mall fails, it puts a damper to revitalization in the 
community," Benbow said. 
</P>
<P>
With 60% of mall space leased and about five more stores to open this month, 
the shopping center's management has been fighting against an attitude among 
businesses that question whether operating in black areas can yield a good 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants don't have stores in any of the black areas of the city, so many 
of them are still leery," said mall manager Leo Ray-Linch. 
</P>
<P>
If the mall is the key factor for commercial growth, the catalyst for a 
residential migration is a neighborhood in the area called View Park, Smothers 
said. View Park, consisting of single-family homes, was formerly the Olympic 
Village for the 1932 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
In View Park, a 4,000-square-foot home can sell for $500,000, moderate by Los 
Angeles standards. Property values reportedly have gone up as much as 100% in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Smothers and others see the possibility of Crenshaw becoming a boom town as 
having mixed results. Crenshaw property values will rise, but could drive out 
black families and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"As blacks sell out, they can't afford to come back," Smothers said. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1980 census statistics, blacks made up 81.5% of the population in 
the Crenshaw area -- bounded by Adams and La Brea boulevards, 79th Street and 
Van Ness Avenue. Asians made up 8%; Latinos 5% and whites 5%. In the coming 
decade, blacks are predicted to make up 78%; Latinos 10%; whites 7% and Asians 
5%, according to the Los Angeles Planning Department and Galanter's office. 
</P>
<P>
Planning deputy Helgeson also spoke about the down-side of revitalization: more 
smog, family displacement and traffic. She provided copies of a traffic study 
that shows major Crenshaw streets will become even more congested by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the federal government may place sanctions on growth to limit 
pollution, Helgeson said: "We can't solve the air pollution problem until we 
solve the traffic problem. If there's a single issue that can dampen Los 
Angeles' growth trend, air pollution is it." 
</P>
<P>
Smothers voiced concern about the role of the area's current residents in 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see where blacks are adapting to the new scheme of things. Our youth 
are not being prepared to take positions of tomorrow. They're not getting an 
education and they're giving way to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Residents attending Crenshaw 2000 urged each other to begin molding the future, 
form partnerships to buy properties and dispel the apathy that they said is 
partly to blame for the unwanted presence of two prison probation offices 
within blocks of each other. 
</P>
<P>
When one resident shouted that two probation offices would never have been put 
in Beverly Hills, another resident, Charles Ludd, replied: "It's not that 
Beverly Hills would not tolerate it. The people of Beverly Hills would not 
tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Galanter and the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce will continue the 
2000 program with a meeting in January. The focus will be on social issues: 
education, crime, art and senior and social service.

GAHR IS AGLOW IN UNFAMILIAR ROLE OF VICTOR; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: COACH SETS HIGH GOALS FOR HIS PLAYERS AND ACHIEVES THEM 'INCH BY 
INCH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Already aglow in victory's unfamiliar warmth, the Gahr High School football 
players did not need the late-afternoon sun that slanted onto their worn 
practice field. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Thursday, and the San Gabriel Valley League's surprise first-place 
team was not burdened by shoulder pads. Some players were even shirtless, but 
all wore dark blue helmets. They stuck mostly to their work, their attention 
drifting only when a car, booming music, pulled into a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go, let's go . . . do it again, do it again," Steve Silberman yelled 
over and over. He appears to be among the new breed of prep coaches: young 
architects of "programs," strong on organization, motivation and philosophy. 
Blond, short and wide-shouldered, he held a clipboard in his hand, a pencil in 
his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be coach of the year, I swear," said Dennis Hildebrandt, a stocky 
senior linebacker/tackle who stood on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
A Christian, Silberman did not swear. He patiently explained to a player, who 
had dropped a pass, that he had not turned his body correctly before trying to 
catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 From the way he stresses fundamentals and his insistence that plays be 
repeated until they are run flawlessly, it is apparent that Silberman is also a 
perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
"When we win, he'll look for the bad points so we can get better," quarterback 
Randy Donisthorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr football, long forlorn, has improved greatly since Silberman arrived two 
years ago. As a result, a wave of relief seems to have washed over the Cerritos 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't he wonderful?" Principal Nadine Barreto said this week at the mention of 
Silberman's name. "I didn't realize what a winning football team can do for a 
school. We have been successful in other sports, but not football. It has 
brought a new spirit to Gahr." 
</P>
<P>
The Gladiators, who have 6 wins and 2 losses overall, are 3-1 in the San 
Gabriel Valley League, tied for first with Dominguez and Paramount. They are 
assured of their first winning season since 1981, only their second since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ashamed to say we're from Gahr anymore," said tight end Danny 
Donisthorpe, Randy's brother. "When I go to a party I'm proud to say I play 
football at Gahr. I look forward to going to school now. Everybody's always 
saying, 'You guys are really good.' Administrators and teachers praise us all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 36, who lives in Fullerton, is a San Fernando Valley native and 
former linebacker at Monroe High School in Sepulveda and Cal State Northridge. 
"I was never the biggest or fastest kid on the team," he said. "I had to work 
my tail off. I had to be stronger and smarter." 
</P>
<P>
After assistant coaching jobs at Crespi and La Habra high schools, Silberman 
became head coach at La Canada High, which had won three games in three years. 
In his second season there, he took the team to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he left La Canada after the second season because of the school's 
declining enrollment. During a two-year stint as head coach at Sonora High in 
La Habra, he also led what had been a struggling team into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, Barreto hired Silberman, who had wanted to move to a 
level of competition higher than that played at Sonora or La Canada. He 
replaced Darrell Walsh, who had resigned under fire after coaching for five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On Silberman's first day at Gahr, Athletic Director Ted Teach gave him a 
Polaroid photo of a 1975 banner that hangs in the gym and salutes Gahr's last 
league football championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'We'd like to have another one,' " Silberman recalls. 
</P>
<P>
And so the coach has aimed high. Written on a board in his narrow, 
high-ceilinged office is his ultimate goal: BEST PROGRAM IN SO. CALIF. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a way to go," Silberman said. "It could take five years. But the kids 
are starting to believe in what we're trying to do. We have a saying, 'Inch by 
inch, it's a cinch.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Gladiators already have attained three goals this season: 
</P>
<P>
* They won a league game. 
</P>
<P>
* They won their school district "championship," defeating Artesia, 22-0, and 
Cerritos, 20-0, quieting the Cerritos students' chant that Gladiator football 
is "Gahr-bage." 
</P>
<P>
* They're guaranteed a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
Other goals are to win the league title, make the playoffs, win a playoff game, 
become CIF champions and have a team grade point average of 2.5. 
</P>
<P>
Each player has in his notebook a list of those goals and a message from 
Silberman on how to fulfill them: "Daily feed your burning obsession to 
achieve. Look at this list every single day and use the magic of believing in 
your goals and they will come true." 
</P>
<P>
When Silberman took over and told the players he was going to change Gahr 
football, Danny Donisthorpe remembers saying, "Yeah, right." 
</P>
<P>
It did not happen immediately. The Gladiators, plagued by penalties and mental 
mistakes, managed to win two games last season. But that had not happened in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the players were shocked at how hard Silberman and his assistants, 
several of whom he brought with him from Sonora, insisted that they work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as weak a group of football players as I've seen," said Silberman, who 
immediately installed a mandatory off-season weight program. 
</P>
<P>
The Gladiators run a mile and a half before practice and run sprints afterward. 
"I've run them harder than I've ever run a football team," Silberman said. "You 
don't hear complaints. It's paid off in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gahr scored all of its points in the final quarter for a 21-19 
victory at Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was pleased with the number of good athletes he had, but disturbed 
that the team was divided by cliques. So before the season he put the players 
in situations in which they had to become better friends. He would take two 
players who were not buddies and pair them so that they had to depend on each 
other to succeed in various drills. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we've all come together," said Randy Donisthorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr has only about 30 varsity players -- other San Gabriel Valley League teams 
have between 40 and 50 -- so most players have to play both offense and 
defense. The roster would be bigger, but Silberman said some students, either 
because they do not want to work hard or are disenchanted with losing, choose 
not to play. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still kids at this school who I wish were playing football and are 
not." Silberman said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have stuck it out have acquired a dedication that helps bond them. At 
7:15 in the morning, players often are in Silberman's office asking to look at 
a videotape of the previous day's practice. 
</P>
<P>
The players know what to expect from Silberman. They know not to wear earrings 
to practice or sit on their helmets, but they also know that a far greater sin 
is to line up incorrectly on the field. They also believe that, although he may 
sometimes throw down his clipboard in frustration, he is also their friend. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Coach Dale Ventress, who has been with Silberman for six years, said, 
"I like the way he helps kids. He's fair with them, sincere. If a kid gets in 
trouble, he doesn't feel bad about calling him." 
</P>
<P>
At other schools, Silberman was known as an especially hard loser. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy losing," he said. "Show me a good loser and I'll show you a 
loser. What gets me upset is when we don't play the way we're capable of 
playing. That to me is losing." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who hopes someday to move up to college coaching, said he does not 
expect his stay at Gahr to be brief. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real excited about being here," he said. "The administration wants (the 
football program) to be the best around." 
</P>
<P>
Barreto said she is not concerned about Silberman's tendency to change schools 
quickly. "I'd rather have quality and success for a short period of time than 
mediocrity forever," the principal said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the six victories this season, the Gladiators have found that their 
reputation as the joke of the league is not easily shed. 
</P>
<P>
"At Paramount they laughed at us . . . when we went on the field," Danny 
Donisthorpe said. Gahr lost to the defending CIF champions, 20-14, but won some 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a pretty good team now," said Paramount Coach Ken Sutch. "They have 
good athletes, are well-coached and seem to play with a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
But the Gladiators are no longer satisfied with mere respect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to keep the score close, we're out to win," said Donn Cunnigan, 
the team's star free safety and receiver. 
</P>
<P>

BOARD PICKS COUNTY FAIR MANAGER; 
</P>
<P>
FAIRGROUNDS: THE CALAVERAS JUBILEE'S DIRECTOR WILL ASSUME THE DUTIES OF JEREMY 
FERRIS, WHO RESIGNED AFTER FOUR CONTROVERSIAL YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A new manager will soon take over the Ventura County Fair, which in recent 
years has been beset with a struggle between those hanging onto tradition and 
others pushing for change. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Paluszak will assume the post vacated Tuesday by Jeremy Ferris, who 
endured a campaign for his resignation during four controversial years as 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak, who has managed fairs and parks for 13 years, "has a clear picture of 
the commitment to tradition that is this fair," said Teri Raley of Creative 
Images, the fair's public relations firm. "He's in harmony with that 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member fair board voted unanimously to hire Paluszak, one of 93 
candidates who applied from across the nation. The position pays between 
$52,220 and $62,112 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak now manages the Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee in 
Angels Camp, an agricultural town about 90 miles southeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new opportunity," Paluszak said. "It's a larger fair and it offers new 
challenges." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura fair's budget last year was about $6.5 million, while the Calaveras 
County fair operated on $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they were impressed with the homework that Paluszak did 
before his interview. He had studied the budget and boned up on plans to 
renovate the fairgrounds, including a proposed $20-million exhibition hall that 
would double as a convention center. 
</P>
<P>
The board also noted a program Paluszak introduced at a previous job in Las 
Vegas that set aside special time for physically and mentally handicapped 
children to use the fairgrounds, Raley said. The Ventura County Fair has been 
considering a similar program. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of thing was almost serendipity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak was executive director and fair manager at the Las Vegas Jaycees State 
Fair from 1978 to 1985. He worked as associate general manager at the Legend 
City Amusement Park in Tempe, Ariz., from 1977 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Paluszak will assume duties in December when he moves to Ventura with his wife, 
Noreen, and 2-year-old daughter, Ivy. 
</P>
<P>
Art Amelio, fair assistant manager, will serve as interim director. 
</P>
<P>
Ferris, who was hired in March, 1985, announced his resignation over the 
summer. He had pledged a three- to five-year commitment and has not said what 
he will do next. 
</P>
<P>
Ferris was criticized by Save the Fair Committee for firing longtime home arts 
superintendent Edna Mills in 1987. The committee called for his resignation and 
circulated petitions demanding Mills' reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
The group also stumped for the fair's return to the traditional October 
schedule. Ferris moved it to August to attract more people. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Henniger, one of the most vocal members of Save the Fair Committee, 
said he wants a "fair director, not a dictator." 
</P>
<P>
Henniger said of the new appointment: "I'm pleased. At least if there's a 
change maybe we have a chance."

PEPPERDINE WATER POLO TEAM TUNES UP FOR NATIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pepperdine water polo team, ranked third nationally, has to fine-tune its 
offense and defense in the final weeks of the season to get ready for the NCAA 
championships, says Coach Terry Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to build positive momentum in preparation for the NCAA championships," 
Schroeder said, "and we have some important regular-season games remaining on 
our schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (20-4 overall, 6-0 in the Big West Conference) will play host to No. 
14 Fresno State (8-16, 0-5) at 4 p.m. Friday and to No. 10 Pacific (7-11, 2-5)

FISHING NOTES;

<P>
EARLY RESULTS OF SAND BASS TAGGING PROJECT ENCOURAGING TO FISH AND GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of the year's first migrating sand bass tag-and-release program are 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the two-year scientific study was launched on Capt. Russ Izor's 
boat, the First String, during five trips in August. 
</P>
<P>
Mac Oliphant, sportfishing biologist with the State Department of Fish and Game 
who heads the tagging project, said important information is being gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Oliphant said 730 bass were tagged and released. Twenty-three tags have been 
recovered and the fish traveled 10 miles in about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the returned tags had marine growth, which he plans to study further. 
</P>
<P>
The question still to be answered is where the fish disappear after spawning 
along sandy beaches from Huntington Beach to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Izor is planning to organize teams of 10 next year to board boats from 
Oceanside to Santa Monica to expand the tagging operation, with Oliphant 
keeping the data from each trip. 
</P>
<P>
Izor said the First String will be available for the South Bay portion of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers catching any species of fish with a tag are urged to tell Fish and Game 
in Long Beach when and where the fish were caught. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Redondo Beach fisherman Clyde Rainwater just returned from Loreto, Baja 
California, where he said he had one of the best fishing trips of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He caught a sailfish that weighed 120 pounds and a dorado that weighed 38 
pounds. In addition, he landed yellowtail and cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
Three San Pedro anglers on a one-day albacore trip aboard the Producer returned 
early Tuesday with an excellent catch: Don Hansen decked a 30-pound bluefin and 
Guy Calafeno and Larry Betencourt caught 28- and 29-pound tuna. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Greg Luehmann of Torrance, on a two-day tuna trip aboard the Sharpshooter, 
caught the whopper of the week when he brought to gaff a 50-pound yellowfin 
tuna. Louis Robinson of Rolling Hills, fishing aboard the Daiwa, hit the 
jackpot with a 31-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Davis of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the China Clipper, caught a 
28-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Porter of Torrance has won the jackpot two weeks straight aboard the 
Redondo Special. Last weekend he caught a 22-pound yellowtail and the previous 
week a big white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Luna of Long Beach, on the Pacifica at San Clemente Island, caught a 
22-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Wang on a half-day trip aboard the Happyman caught a 21 1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kinkel of West Los Angeles, aboard the Spitfire, caught a 16 1/2-pound 
halibut.

A WAVE FROM YUGOSLAVIA; 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO: SASA POLJAK HAD TROUBLE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE IN THE CLASSROOM WHEN 
HE ARRIVED AT PEPPERDINE, BUT HE'S AT HOME IN THE WATER AS ONE OF THE TOP 
SCORERS ON THE NATIONALLY RANKED TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pepperdine water polo star Sasa Poljak first came to the school's Malibu 
campus from his native Yugoslavia, he knew hardly a word of English. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived on an athletic scholarship in June, 1985, and was to attend his 
first classes the following September. Realizing that he had to learn English 
as quickly as possible, Poljak (pronounced POLE-yak) buttonholed everybody he 
met and tried out phrases he had picked up from television and books. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I was extremely annoying, but I would speak to anybody and say, 
'Don't hesitate to correct me any time, or I won't get through my classes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Poljak's method of learning by being a pain in the neck apparently worked. In 
his first term, he passed his classes and told himself, "There's no way they 
can fail me now." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine opponents may have wished that Poljak's conversation partners had 
told him to go jump in the lake and that he had understood and followed orders. 
He has been a pain in the neck to other water polo teams since he first started 
playing for Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
In his first three years, the 6-foot, 6-inch fifth-year senior scored 243 
goals, including 83 each in 1986 and 1987, when he helped the Waves gain NCAA 
tournament berths. He was chosen an All-American in 1987, was twice selected to 
All-Big West Conference teams and was named the conference co-player of the 
year (with Greg Wilson of UC Irvine) in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He would have played his senior season in 1988, but Pepperdine Coach Terry 
Schroeder, who spent the first five weeks of last season as captain of the 
silver-medalist U. S. Olympic team, asked Poljak and Rafael Gandarillas of 
Puerto Rico to redshirt last year. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's theory was that Poljak and Gandarillas, another high-scoring 
fifth-year senior, would have been wasted by playing on last year's squad, 
which was filled with inexperienced players. The theory was borne out when the 
1988 Waves, coached by assistant David Myers for the early part of the season, 
finished 8-17 overall, 3-7 in the Big West Conference, and failed to land an 
NCAA berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder, who led the U.S. national team to its second straight silver 
medal in the 1988 Olympics, was confident that Poljak and Gandarillas could be 
a big help to this year's Waves, buoyed by the return of redshirt sophomore 
Geoffrey Clark, who played for Australia's 1988 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that Poljak and Gandarillas "knew (last year) that they were 
going to have to take a few extra classes to graduate and that (their) 
redshirting would let the younger guys develop and (the team would have) a 
chance to do a little bit better this year." 
</P>
<P>
That may have been the understatement of the year in college water polo. 
Pepperdine, ranked third nationally, is 20-4 overall, 6-0 in the Big West, and 
seems assured of going to the NCAA championships on Nov. 24 and 25 in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's absentees from last year are all doing very well. Clark has scored 
a team-high 71 goals, followed by Poljak with 60 and Gandarillas with 40. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pepperdine coach knew he would get a lot of scoring from that trio. He 
wasn't sure about something else: "At the beginning of the year, my biggest 
concern was that I didn't think we had the ability to play defense." 
</P>
<P>
It soon became apparent that he needn't have been concerned. The Waves have 
been scoring an average of 12.63 goals a game while holding opponents to 7.75 
goals a game. 
</P>
<P>
The low scoring of other teams, Schroeder said, is a direct result of "good 
defense and a good goalie. Wells Guthrie has been coming on strong for us in 
the cage." Guthrie, a sophomore from Newport Harbor High School, has 192 saves 
and a goals-against average of 6.81. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that Poljak, 24, would have resisted staying at Pepperdine 
another season, particularly since Clark and he play the same position, the 
two-meter or hole man, and that Clark has taken over the scoring leadership 
from the Yugoslav. You'd be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind staying," Poljak said. "I was excited because I knew that Clark 
was coming back, and Gandarillas would also be back. We wouldn't have helped 
last year's team as much as this one -- and there was no way we would have won" 
the conference last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also had a year more to decide what I'm going to do with my life." 
</P>
<P>
Poljak said he has not resented Clark for taking away the scoring spotlight. 
"I'm happy to give it to the younger generation," he said. "Clark is a 
world-class player and has a great mind and attitude toward the game. I've 
never seen anyone with the physical ability to play water polo that he has." 
Because Clark and Poljak are both hole men, Schroeder said, he has been able to 
rest Poljak more than in the past and his defense and the team's have 
consequently improved. 
</P>
<P>
"Sasa (pronounced Sasha) has always been a very good all-around player," 
Schroeder said, "but he's been helped on defense by not having to set hole 
(like a basketball center in the pivot) at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Players on offense are "constantly wrestling and tend to rest a bit on 
defense," Schroeder said. "Being able to rotate (Poljak and Clark), to switch 
those guys in and out, allows them to work harder on defense. And I think that 
has helped the team a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
Poljak has been a big help to Pepperdine, but there was a time when he was 
something of a hindrance. He may have learned English by talking, but in his 
early matches with Waves he sometimes used his new language to talk out of 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first got here he was used to the European style of play," Schroeder 
said. When someone on a European team is not doing well, he said, "they yell at 
each other to fire the rest of the guys up. We don't do that here; we try to 
build each other up rather than yell at each other." 
</P>
<P>
Poljak, who must have picked up the English vernacular quickly, tried out some 
of the earthier phrases on his teammates. Schroeder said Poljak sometimes used 
to demonstrate "a bad temper. But he has learned to control his emotions and is 
a better player (because of that). He is the team captain this year, which has 
helped him mature. When you have to be a leader, it has a calming effect in the 
water. I think Sasa has grown a lot as a player and a person." 
</P>
<P>
Poljak may be outgrowing water polo after a long career that started when he 
was 11 and included years of playing for Yugoslavia's junior national and 
national teams. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he still enjoys the game, but that he intends to pursue bigger 
game with his business-communications major when he graduates. His mother, he 
said, wants him to settle down in his hometown of Zagreb, but he plans to 
return to the United States after graduation and a visit to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to become an entrepreneur in international trade, he said, dealing 
with Yugoslavia in the commodities market. No doubt he will be a wheeler-dealer 
who talks a mean game.

In the race book at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last week, a horseplayer from 
Los Angeles was able to make a $5,000 win bet at 2-1 odds in the Breeders' Cup 
Mile, and he'll cash the ticket if any horse but Simply Majestic, Political 
Ambition or Warning wins. 
</P>
<P>
Strange things happen in those future-book horse parlors in Las Vegas. Months 
before the Kentucky Derby this year, one of them was still quoting a price on a 
horse that had died. In recent weeks, Houston was listed as one of the 
favorites in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, even though trainer Wayne Lukas said 
repeatedly that the colt wasn't going to run. In fact, Houston has undergone 
knee surgery and is out for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The expression caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware -- didn't originate at 
Nevada sports books, but a sign with that Latin phrase ought to be posted in 
every establishment. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, instead of bettors bucking the odds, some of them have an 
excellent chance to beat the house, at least in the Mile, one of the seven 
Breeders' Cup races Saturday at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
When Caesars opened its future book on the Breeders' Cup, odds were listed on 
more than 50 horses that were candidates for the Mile on grass. 
</P>
<P>
But when 20 horses were pre-entered with $20,000 payments 10 days ago, only 
four of them -- Golden Opinion, Simply Majestic, Political Ambition and Warning 
-- were on Caesars' 50-plus list. As a result, the other 16 went into a mutuel 
field, which means that a bettor gets them all for just one bet. 
</P>
<P>
Of those 16 horses, 11 are starting Saturday. Of the horses listed separately 
by Caesars, Golden Opinion has been scratched and is a probable entrant in the 
Yellow Ribbon Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, the second choice behind Zilzal in the Mile, wound up in Caesars' 
mutuel field on a technicality. There was some money bet at the hotel on a 
horse listed as "Steinlend," but because the name was misspelled, those bets 
were canceled and Steinlen also became part of the multiple-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnie Magliulo, the manager of the sports book at Caesars, confirmed what 
happened to the hotel's future-book betting, except for the part about 
Steinlen. "I heard some discussion about Steinlen the other day," Magliulo 
said, "but I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Magliulo referred a reporter to the director of the race book, but he could not 
be reached for comment. Magliulo said that after Breeders' Cup entries were 
taken at Gulfstream Wednesday, the future book closed and regular betting on 
the races began, with each horse a separate betting interest. After the $5,000 
bet from Los Angeles was made on the mutuel field, those odds reportedly 
dropped to even-money. 
</P>
<P>
"We had people betting on those 50 or so horses for weeks," Magliulo said. "And 
since most of them aren't running, we don't expect to get hurt on bets like the 
one from L.A. That guy who bet the $5,000 has got a good bet, all right, but 
the three horses he has to beat aren't exactly slouches." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the interview, Magliulo didn't know that Warning suffered a 
bruised and swollen right foreleg on his trip here from Great Britain. He's 
likely to be scratched, which would leave the Los Angeles bettor with only two 
horses to beat. 
</P>
<P>
In order to squeeze about 50,000 Breeders' Cup fans into a plant that seldom 
has to accommodate more than 35,000, Gulfstream Park has installed temporary 
seats in almost every available space. On the outside of the clubhouse turn, 
for example, are portable bleachers that can seat several thousand people. 
</P>
<P>
Some trainers are concerned that their horses might get spooked because they 
will be unaccustomedly close to spectators Saturday, both in the paddock and 
when they're on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas was asked about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone has trouble with the crowds, it will be the horses that have been 
running in New York," Lukas said, "because they're only used to running in 
front of about 5,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance hasn't dropped off to that extent at New York tracks, but Lukas 
wasn't exaggerating by much. 
</P>
<P>
The question that trainer Charlie Whittingham has been asked most often this 
week is how the jockey switch from Pat Valenzuela to Chris McCarron will affect 
Sunday Silence. Valenzuela lost the mount last week when Santa Anita stewards 
suspended him for 60 days after a positive cocaine test. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has come up with a stock answer to the question: "The change is 
harder on Valenzuela than the horse." 
</P>
<P>
The winning jockey's share of the the first-place purse in the Classic is 
$135,000. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, there was valid talk that the Classic was going to be a 
three-horse race, with Blushing John threatening the big two of Easy Goer and 
Sunday Silence, but Blushing John is being dismissed by many because of the 
miserable race he ran in New Jersey on Oct. 13. Blushing John, who has won 
stakes at Oaklawn Park, Pimlico, Hollywood Park and Arlington International 
this year, finished ahead of only one horse in the Meadowlands Cup, losing to 
Mi Selecto by 20 lengths. Now he is 8-1 on the morning line, behind Easy Goer, 
Sunday Silence and Present Value. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dick Lundy is puzzled by Blushing John's Meadowlands race. "The only 
thing I can figure is that I made a mistake by sending him from Belmont Park 
over there for schooling the night before," Lundy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to get used to running at night, which he had never done before. 
We could have vanned him back to Belmont after the schooling and then returned 
him to the Meadowlands the night of the race, but we just kept him there. I 
found out later that they leave the barn lights on all night at the 
Meadowlands, and he couldn't handle that and only got about an hour and a half 
of sleep. Then he had to wait all day before he ran. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have made a difference, but if I didn't do what I did and he ran a bad 
race, then I'd be second-guessing myself, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream Park usually isn't open at this time of the year but was granted 
permission by Florida to conduct the Breeders' Cup weekend, providing it paid a 
penalty to Calder, a nearby track, which is shutting down for three days. 
Calder reportedly is receiving $75,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Breeders' Cup this weekend, Gulfstream will run three stakes 
Friday, three to open the Breeders' Cup program Saturday and three more Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Doyouseewhatisee, a California invader, is favored in the $100,000 
Chief's Crown Stakes for 2-year-olds; Fieldy is the morning-line choice in the 
$100,000 Very Subtle Stakes for fillies and mares, and Wanderkin is 
high-weighted at 117 pounds in the $200,000 Theatrical Handicap on grass for 
3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Turfah, on the also-eligible list for the Breeders' Cup Turf, is also entered 
in the Theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
Despite beating Nashwan at a time when he was considered to be the best horse 
in Europe, Golden Pheasant could do no better than make the also-eligible list 
for the Breeders' Cup Turf. Golden Pheasant, raced by owner Bruce McNall and 
Wayne Gretzky of the Kings, ran 14th in the Arc de Triomphe after beating 
Nashwan. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham hasn't saddled a horse here since he won the Gulfstream 
Park Handicap with Pretense 22 years ago. . . . When Laffit Pincay rides Mi 
Selecto in the Classic, he will be the eighth jockey this year on the 
4-year-old colt, who is making his 13th start. . . . Cash Asmussen isn't riding 
in the Breeders' Cup because of injuries.

Top Cash led the entire race, edging favorite Drag Race in the $109,450 Desert 
Wine Sales Stakes Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay took Top Cash to the lead out of the gate, staying slightly ahead 
of Alycastle through the stretch and closed to win by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Drag Race, the Del Mar Futurity winner with Gary Stevens aboard, finished a 
neck ahead of Kept His Cool, a 15-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
Top Cash, trained by Wayne Lukas, returned $10,20, $3.60 and $2.60 in getting 
his second win in three career starts. Drag Race paid $2.60 and $2.40, and Kept

HULL MAKES BELIEVERS OF WHALERS -- AND DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The hardest job for Brett Hull was to prove to his father that he was a good 
hockey player. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Bobby Hull, is one of the all-time hockey greats. The Hall of 
Famer, who had a shot that was timed at 140 m.p.h., is now a believer, along 
with just about everyone else in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
It did not bother Brett Hull that he was facing the hottest goaltender in the 
NHL Wednesday night at Hartford, Conn. Hull had two goals and two assists to 
lead the St. Louis Blues to a 5-3 victory over Mike Liut and the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Liut went into the game with a goals-against average of 1.56, two consecutive 
shutouts and a scoreless string of 120 minutes 21 seconds. He extended the 
string to 147 minutes 28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Hull assisted on Rod Brind'Amour's goal at 5:07 of the second period that tied 
the score, then scored at 16:31 to put the Blues ahead to stay. Hull scored his 
league-leading 13th goal to make it 4-1 midway through the final period. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, when Brett was starting his fourth NHL season, his dad said he 
lacked motivation and the proper attitude to become a star. Dad has changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the other day he needn't take a back seat to (Wayne) Gretzky, 
(Steve) Yzerman and (Mario) Lemieux anymore," he said. "I'm proud of him, as 
long as he doesn't get too high on what he's doing and always realizes that it 
takes hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Brett is noted for a blistering slap shot, one of the hardest 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, after struggling for three seasons, became a complete player for the 
Blues last season. He led the Blues with 41 goals and 43 assists and became 
much more than just a shooter. This seems to be his season for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no Gretzky," Hull told the Associated Press. "I just go out there and try 
to do my best. The way I'm going lately, I'm getting chances and the puck is 
going into the net." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, Detroit 5 -- In a strange game at Detroit, Tim Kerr scored his 
second goal of the game with 7:49 left to get the Flyers a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers led, 4-3, when goalie Ken Wregget injured his leg and had to leave 
the game eight minutes into the last period. His replacement, Pete Peeters, had 
no warm up and gave up two goals in 49 seconds and Detroit led, 5-4. Peeters 
stopped the last eight shots he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, Winnipeg 3 -- Joe Nieuwendyk scored twice and had an assist at 
Calgary to lead the Flames to a hard-fought victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk's second goal, into an empty net with just one second left, was his 
13th, tying Brett Hull for the league lead. Gary Roberts also scored twice for 
the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 6, New Jersey 6 -- Mark Messier scored his 10th goal of the season 
with 6:19 left in regulation at Edmonton to give the Oilers a hard-earned tie. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams scored twice in the third period in the first five minutes. Jari 
Kurri scored his 11th for Edmonton. DAN HAFNER

CONFEREES SAID TO RETAIN B-2, CUT 'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House and Senate conferees Wednesday reached accord on virtually all remaining 
issues involving the $305-billion 1990 defense budget, trimming the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile program but keeping the costly and controversial B-2 Stealth 
bomber alive, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of relatively small questions remained unresolved Wednesday 
night, committee leaders are likely to announce the budget agreement today, 
sources said. A House aide cautioned that the deal could unravel in a series of 
meetings scheduled for this morning but added that major problems are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to emerge as a series of compromises on defense spending 
priorities between the two houses as well as between Congress and the White 
House. House members failed in an effort to gut "Star Wars." But they won a 
reprieve for two aircraft programs -- the F-14D and the V-22 -- that the Senate 
and the Administration had wanted to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats and the Administration settled a sharp disagreement 
over which of two mobile missiles to build by authorizing more than $1 billion 
to develop both. 
</P>
<P>
After conference committee approval, the spending measure will go to the full 
House and Senate. Under parliamentary rules, lawmakers can approve or 
disapprove the measure, but they cannot amend it. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said that the conference leaders, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Rep. Les 
Aspin (D-Wis.), chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services committees, are 
confident that President Bush will sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The budget plan is for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The Defense 
Department has been operating under a stopgap spending measure since then. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the conference committee approved $3.57 billion for the "Star Wars" 
space defense program, more than $1 billion less than the Administration 
requested and less than last year's funding of $3.7 billion. The figure split 
the difference between the $2.8 billion voted earlier by the House and $4.3 
billion approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But in a victory for the Administration and the Air Force, Congress authorized 
production of two of the $530-million B-2 bombers in fiscal year 1990 and five 
in 1991. The Administration had sought a total of six bombers over the two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional aide said that the defense bill was crafted to meet members' 
parochial interests as well as to avoid a veto by President Bush. The President 
had threatened to veto the bill if he thought that "Star Wars" or B-2 funding 
was too low. 
</P>
<P>
The committee reached its compromise after seven weeks of debate on a variety 
of other issues, from funding for the rail version of the MX missile to 
continued production of the Navy's F-14D fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers authorized $1.28 billion for putting 50 multi-warhead MX 
intercontinental missiles on rail cars, as well as continued research on the 
Midgetman single-warhead missile, a favorite of congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The two-missile deal ratified the Administration's decision not to choose 
between the two mobile missile systems, but rather to fund both. The plan 
allows Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and the Air Force to decide how much of 
the $1.28 billion to spend on each system. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, which takes off like a helicopter but 
flies like an airplane, was left uncertain. The conferees included funding for 
V-22 research and development only, postponing a decision on production until 
next year. The V-22 program potentially would cost $26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney had recommended that the F-14D and the V-22 be terminated, arguing that 
the Pentagon cannot afford them. The Navy will be permitted to buy 18 new 
F-14Ds, manufactured by the Grumman Corp. on New York's Long Island, for $1.4 
billion. But the deal calls for the production line to be permanently halted 
after the new planes are completed, committee aides said. 
</P>
<P>
New York lawmakers lobbied heavily for the program, which was the subject of 
the most bitter debate in the budget conference, aides said. The Senate had 
voted to accept Cheney's recommendation to kill the plane, while House members 
succeeded in keeping it alive for one more year, temporarily preserving more 
than 5,000 jobs on populous Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Wars" supporters immediately blasted the funding cut for the space 
program -- formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative -- demanding that 
Bush veto the entire bill. 
</P>
<P>
"If President Bush doesn't take this leadership action on behalf of the future 
of SDI and the American people, then he will have to share some of the blame 
with Congress for the eventual demise of the SDI program and its potential for 
providing a real defense for the American people," said John Kwapisz of the 
Center for Peace and Freedom, a strong supporter of SDI.

East Germany's new Communist leader, Egon Krenz, said here Wednesday that he

predicted that its adoption will mark a historic turning point for his country.

Krenz, speaking after three hours of talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, said he wants to apply the lessons of perestroika (restructuring) to 
East Germany. But he cautioned that he intends to strengthen -- not weaken -- 
socialism through reform. 
</P>
<P>
With tens of thousands of East Germans continuing to demonstrate daily, 
demanding free elections, legalization of opposition groups, an end to press 
censorship and other changes, Krenz said the party leadership is committed to 
reform and to opening a political dialogue with its critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are out on the streets to show that they want a better socialism 
and the renovation of society," Krenz said. "I consider this to be a very good 
sign, an indication that we are at a turning point in the life of the German 
Democratic Republic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We will take up every idea that is expressed," Krenz said. "I cannot, of 
course, promise that we will solve all the problems, but we should not just be 
making promises but getting down to work." 
</P>
<P>
He said the party will propose changes in the country's election laws before 
the 1991 parliamentary elections and put forward legislation soon that will 
permit every East German to obtain "a passport and visa for travel to every 
country in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the mass flight of more than 120,000 of the country's 16.6-million 
people to West Germany this year, Krenz said he believes that reforms will 
persuade East Germans to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"When we make socialism more attractive in our land, then there is no doubt 
that trust will be regained and people will stay at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Widely regarded as a hard-liner, the 52-year-old Krenz sought to project an 
image of conciliation and reform at his first full-scale news conference since 
replacing Erich Honecker, the longtime East German party leader who was his 
political mentor. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come for change in East Germany, he said of Honecker's retirement 
two weeks ago, adding, "Those who do not want to accept changes are not real 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
He rejected the characterization of himself as tough and ideologically orthodox 
in the Honecker mold. "I am not a hard-liner -- I am a Communist," he declared 
in the course of a lively, 75-minute exchange with the press. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker had rejected perestroika, the Gorbachev reform program, as 
unnecessary, at least for East Germany, and had told other East European 
leaders that he feared it threatened the ideological purity of socialism. But 
Krenz emphasized that he wants to implement similar changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We wholeheartedly support the process of revolutionary perestroika in the 
Soviet Union," he said. "The process of perestroika determines the future of 
socialism in the world, and the future of the world depends on its success." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet experience is a valuable lesson, he said, in political, economic and 
social reform. He said his party intends, as the Soviet Communist Party has 
tried, to draw everyone into the reform process and not to restrict politics 
and power to party members. 
</P>
<P>
But every socialist country must make its own decisions, he said, and East 
Germany is not looking to the experiments in political pluralism in neighboring 
Poland or Hungary for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"The main idea we think we can use is that perestroika is aimed at making 
socialism more attractive and more effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Krenz, who led the East German youth organization and then was in charge of 
security matters, made it clear that some things remain immutable. The Berlin 
Wall will not come down, he said, and German reunification is out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
The wall, erected in 1961 to halt an earlier exodus of political refugees to 
West Germany, is not only "a barrier to prevent people meeting each other," as 
the West has charged, he said. "This is not just a border between two states 
but between two social systems and two military blocs with a great 
concentration of military power in the vicinity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This border is a kind of protective shield. . . . The reason for it still 
exists. We should have a realistic point of view and not live in illusions." 
</P>
<P>
German reunification is also an illusion, Krenz said. "This question is not on 
our agenda," he said, asserting that there is "nothing to reunite" between 
socialist East Germany and the capitalist West. "The stability of Europe is 
more important."

HERALD EXAMINER WILL HALT PUBLISHING TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
NEWSPAPERS: 118 YEARS OF PUBLICATION IN LOS ANGELES ENDS WITH DEMISE OF HEARST 
DAILY. HEAVY FINANCIAL LOSSES FORCED THE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, strapped with declining circulation and 
shrinking revenues, announced Wednesday that it will cease publication as of 
today, closing out a 118-year history that provided Los Angeles with some of 
its richest journalistic lore. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Danzig, Hearst vice president and general manager of the company's 
newspapers, stood on a desk Wednesday in the Herald's newsroom and broke the 
news in a brief statement to the assembled staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with great regret that we have made this decision," Danzig said. "It has 
been a losing business but a winning newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
He said afterward that the decision to close the paper had been made at noon. 
It came after a much-publicized yearlong search for a buyer by the New 
York-based Hearst Corp. The Herald was expected to lose $18.7 million this 
year, but is now losing as much as $2 million a month, according to sources 
familiar with the paper's books. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald's circulation as of Sept. 30 was 232,437, down from 721,026 after 
the merger of the morning Examiner and the afternoon Herald-Express created the 
Herald Examiner in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The closing leaves Los Angeles only one downtown-based general interest daily 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times executives said they might pick up at most 50,000 Herald 
readers, and other local papers stand to gain some circulation. Nearly 90,000 
of the Herald's readers already buy another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members were stunned by Danzig's announcement, even though for months 
many of them, alert to the dire possibilities, had been searching for work 
elsewhere. Many cried and embraced. Others simply walked around talking to each 
other, trying to take in the enormity of what they had just heard. 
</P>
<P>
Their reaction spoke to the esprit de corps that permeated the news staff in 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, everybody saw it coming," said Herald Deputy City Editor Lennie 
LaGuire. "Most of us had come to terms with the fact that it was going to close 
sometime soon. But I was kind of hoping it would last past the first of the 
year, that we could keep going with some of the stories we were working on." 
</P>
<P>
She added, tearfully: "I just can't believe it feels like this, to close like 
an insurance office. It really feels like a death in the family." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like everybody got punched in the stomach," said reporter Ellis Conklin. 
"Everybody's having a hard time breathing." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Alina Tugend was intently taking notes during a speech by former 
President Jimmy Carter at the Biltmore when a consultant coordinating public 
relations for the event pulled her aside. He had to tell her the Herald's plug 
had been pulled. 
</P>
<P>
"Alina just said, 'OK, thanks,' and left abruptly, very upset," said the 
consultant, David H. Novak. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 p.m., an hour after the announcement, an assistant sports editor 
telephoned hockey writer Rick Sadowski at a hotel in Boston, where he was on 
assignment to cover a game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Sadowski, a 10-year Herald veteran, had planned to fly to Hartford on Saturday 
and Buffalo on Sunday with the Kings. "But I just called the airport and made 
arrangements to come home," he said. "There's no reason to cover those games 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Like many employees, Sadowski worried about the financial fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"We just bought a house in September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Herald employees had clung to the belief that a financial angel would come 
to the rescue. Tycoons like Marvin Davis, Kirk Kerkorian and Malcolm Forbes 
were rumored as possible buyers -- "everybody but Donald Trump," one 
advertising man said. Others speculated that Japanese investors would take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Did Our Job' 
</P>
<P>
Jeryl Parade, an assistant manager in classified advertising, was one of 
several Herald workers upset with Hearst corporate management. Market studies, 
Parade said, showed that the Herald provided a special advertising niche, 
especially in automotive and job recruitment ads. "Tomorrow we'll have our Auto 
'90 Preview -- our biggest preview of cars ever. And our classifieds have 
grown," Parade said. "We did our job here." 
</P>
<P>
As required by a new federal law governing plant shutdowns, employees will be 
paid and will receive benefits for the next 60 days. An outplacement agency has 
been retained to help employees find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The paper is the descendant of Hearst's Examiner, founded 86 years ago, the 
morning Herald, started 112 years ago, and the Los Angeles Express, which began 
publishing 118 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, the Examiner scored scoops on everything from the "Black Dahlia" 
murder case to the explosion of the first H-bomb. The afternoon Herald Express 
under Hearst was the largest afternoon paper west of Chicago. The Herald 
Express also had the first woman city editor in Agness (Aggie) Underwood in 
1937. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert H. Krauch started at the Herald as an office boy in 1912. The first 
week he was there, City Editor Jack Campbell got into an argument over a story 
with reporter Peter Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Campbell floored Peter Dunn with one punch," Krauch, now 93, recalled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Krauch had been studying civil engineering, but "after I saw the fistfight, I 
thought newspaper work was so exciting, I decided to become a newspaper man." 
</P>
<P>
He rose through the ranks, serving as editor of the paper from 1952 to 1962. He 
was in charge of combining the Herald-Express and the Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to let go about 265 editorial people from the Examiner, a lot of them 
friends of mine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noticed a big safe in the Examiner office. He asked what 
was in it and was told, "Nothing now, but we used to keep $25,000 in the safe, 
because Mr. Hearst would call at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning asking for 100 
or 200 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Expressions of regret about the closing came from politicians and community 
leaders, and they shared a common theme: Any reduction in newspaper competition 
is a loss for readers. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles will be poorer for it," said City Council President John Ferraro. 
"The Herald Examiner has been a strong voice in our city and its reporting of 
events will certainly be missed." 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more blow against freedom of the press," said County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn. "We need as many newspapers as possible to tell the public about 
government at the local level." 
</P>
<P>
"The closing of the Herald Examiner limits the choices for Los Angeles 
readers," said Mayor Tom Bradley in a statement issued by his press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to The Times and the San Fernando Valley-based Daily News, he added, 
"I sincerely hope the two remaining daily newspapers focus attention on 
covering the entire city, bringing attention to unheard stories that impact 
many of the 3.4 million people who make the City of Los Angeles home." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Herald did a better job in dealing with local issues and minority 
communities," said Linda Wong, executive director of California Tomorrow, an 
immigrants' advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald has received acclaim in the past year for its investigations into 
the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who works in a competitive city knows that competition keeps staff on 
their toes and much more concerned (about) missing stories," said Ben H. 
Bagdikian, a professor at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. 
"Competition . . . has always meant an improvement in the quality of 
reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Times Publisher David Laventhol stated: "The absence of the Herald is going to 
place an even greater responsibility on The Times to be fair, accurate and 
complete in its reporting and to provide a forum for multiple voices on 
important issues." 
</P>
<P>
Added Times Editor Shelby Coffey III: "It's a sad day for journalism and a sad 
day for Southern California. The Herald Examiner has been a lively competitor 
and it will be a melancholy absence." 
</P>
<P>
The Times is considering picking up some of the Herald's syndicated features 
and is reviewing applications from many Herald employees. The Times also will 
acquire more than 10,000 of the Herald's newspaper stands and racks, and its 
subscription list. 
</P>
<P>
Among prospective buyers who looked at the paper, it was learned, were the 
Toronto Sun Publishing Co. of Canada, movie and oil tycoon Marvin Davis, 
British tabloid publisher Robert Maxwell, and a group that included City News 
Service owner Tom Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in 1962 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Hearst was not demanding a heavy price, only someone with the money 
and commitment to make a serious attempt at turning the publication around. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's problems dated to 1962, when Hearst chose to concentrate on 
afternoon circulation, merging the morning Examiner with the less successful 
Herald-Express. The announcement closely followed the closure by Times Mirror 
Co. of its afternoon paper, The Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
That left The Times with no morning competition, and the Herald was forced to 
pursue a blue-collar audience that tended to go to work and return home earlier 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers followed the money. By 1967, The Times enjoyed a 2-1 advantage in 
advertising, despite only a 120,000 lead in circulation. The Herald's 
readership started to fall. 
</P>
<P>
That year the American Newspaper Guild struck the Herald over wages and was 
eventually joined by 11 other unions. By the time the strike ended 10 years 
later, the Herald's circulation was just 330,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hearst has thrashed around for a comeback strategy, trying to 
position the paper for more sophisticated readers, pondering a conversion to a 
tabloid. It also converted back to a morning publication. 
</P>
<P>
As circulation declined, rumors of the paper's demise or sale swirled around 
the city from time to time. But the Herald was a powerful symbol to the Hearst 
family, which is still active in the company. The building at 11th and 
Broadway, with its hand-painted tiled entrance floor and gold and black onyx 
lobby, once included press lord William Randolph Hearst's private apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers for Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services said chances are 
good that the ornate Herald building will be sold to someone who will keep the 
existing structure. "A major printer could use that, maybe a group that prints 
law books," said broker Ray Lepone.

QUAKE ROAD REBUILDING PUT AT $1.5 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHWAYS: CALTRANS WARNS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY MAY HAVE TO FEND FOR 
THEMSELVES. PLAN OUTLINED TO COMPENSATE NIMITZ FREEWAY VICTIMS.

<P>
Caltrans Director Robert K. Best on Wednesday said it will cost about $1.5 
billion to rebuild state and local roads damaged in the Bay Area earthquake and 
outlined a proposal to compensate victims of the Nimitz Freeway collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Best, testifying before a special hearing of the state Senate Transportation 
Committee, said the federal government will cover at least half and probably 
more of the state's rebuilding expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The rest will have to be paid by California taxpayers, either through a 
temporary sales tax increase to be considered by the Legislature today or out 
of funds already earmarked for highway construction statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments, which will be faced with an estimated 
$300-million-to-$500-million road repair bill from the earthquake, may have to 
fend largely for themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Best said it will also cost the state between $300 million and $500 million to 
complete a program to enable every state highway to withstand the strongest 
earthquake imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
It is crucial, Best said, for the state to move quickly to spend the emergency 
federal aid because any funds spent in the next six months will not have to be 
matched by the state. He asked the lawmakers to pass legislation that would 
waive laws and regulations that can delay the design and construction of 
freeway projects. 
</P>
<P>
That request was opposed by the Sierra Club and the city of Oakland. But Best 
promised that Caltrans would not abuse that authority if it is granted. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are allowed to expedite, that doesn't mean we are going to slap on the 
blinders and put our heads and noses down to the center line and just roar," 
Best said. "We will be going through a type of process that involves the local 
governments, involving environmental groups and other interest groups that 
legitimately have something to be said." 
</P>
<P>
In other comments to the committee, Best gave the first details of the 
Deukmejian Administration's proposal to offer victims of the Nimitz Freeway 
collapse compensation outside of the courts' civil liability system. 
</P>
<P>
He said the survivors and the heirs of those killed should be given the choice 
of suing the state or applying for payments through a simplified claims system 
that could include arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Best did not concede that the state would be legally liable for the collapse. 
He said the courts found the state not responsible for the deaths of two people 
killed in the collapse of a bridge in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
said he believed that the disaster could cost the state "hundreds of millions 
of dollars" in legal judgments or settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer said the state would have a "very weak defense, if anything at all," if 
it is sued for the deaths and injuries on the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the matter out of the courts, Best said the Deukmejian Administration 
will ask the Legislature to enact the special reimbursement system, which would 
be aimed at providing quick payments without the need for lawyers, who often 
collect 30% or more of court-awarded liability judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are dealing with here is not a liability question but earthquake 
relief," Best said. "Otherwise, you are dealing with people who may have 
suffered very severe personal damages and the only mechanism open to them would 
be the very arduous, time-consuming and, to some degree, uncertain tort 
recovery system." 
</P>
<P>
Best said he envisions a program under which the state would compensate victims 
immediately for minor costs, such as the replacement of damaged vehicles or 
lost income. Larger claims would be deferred for a short time and settled 
through an arbitration process. 
</P>
<P>
Providing quick and easy settlements for victims, Best said, would be "more 
important than providing an open-ended liability scheme for people to try to 
take advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
In the Oct. 17 earthquake, with a 7.1 magnitude, the upper deck of the Nimitz 
Freeway collapsed onto the lower roadway. Officials now say that 41 people died 
in the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers have offered a number of theories for the freeway's collapse, but the 
leading explanation centers around failure of joints connecting the upper and 
lower columns.

RESEARCHERS FIND PANIC ATTACK LINK TO SUICIDES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: DISABLING BOUTS OF ACUTE ANXIETY AFFECT MILLIONS. DOCTORS OUGHT TO 
TAKE THE UNPREDICTABLE EPISODES SERIOUSLY, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
People who experience panic attacks are more likely than others to attempt or 
consider suicide, according to a new study that researchers say should prompt 
physicians to take more seriously an anxiety disorder afflicting millions of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, documents 
for the first time a direct link between suicide attempts and panic attacks -- 
bouts of acute anxiety often accompanied by intense fears of death or madness. 
Suicide is believed to be triggered primarily by depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that panic disorder is another risk factor for suicide 
attempts," said Myrna M. Weissman, the Columbia University epidemiologist who 
headed the study. "I think that panic disorder ought to be taken seriously. It 
ought to be diagnosed." 
</P>
<P>
Panic attacks are recurrent, unpredictable episodes of sudden apprehension or 
fear, as Weissman and others describe them. The symptoms may include 
palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, a smothering sensation, sweating, 
faintness and trembling. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 10% of all people experience panic attacks at some point during 
their lives, epidemiological studies show. About 1.6% to 2% suffer from the 
more serious panic disorder, in which attacks occur as frequently as once a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
People with panic attacks and panic disorder tend to worry about their attacks. 
As a result, many become unable to concentrate or sleep. Chronic fatigue and 
strain can cause increased anxiety and depression, driving some to alcohol and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Many turn up repeatedly in hospital emergency rooms, fearing they are having a 
heart attack. Some become unwilling to be alone, to venture into public places 
or to return to places where panic attacks have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The precise cause of the attacks is unclear. In some cases, the tendency may be 
inherited. The condition has become better known in recent years and can be 
treated with drugs and therapy. However, specialists say many physicians fail 
to take the symptoms seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Weissman's group studied 18,011 adults living in five U.S. communities, 
including Los Angeles. Each participant was interviewed extensively using a 
standard questionnaire designed to identify a wide range of established 
psychiatric conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers then divided the sample into four groups -- people who had been 
diagnosed with panic disorder, people with panic attacks, people with other 
psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, and people with no 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Among those with panic disorder, 20% had attempted suicide at some time in 
their lives. By contrast, only 12% of those with panic attacks, 6% of those 
with other psychiatric disorders and 1% of those with no disorder had attempted 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 47% of those with panic disorder reported having "felt so low" that 
they had considered suicide. By contrast, 35% of those with panic attacks, 19% 
of those with other disorders, and only 4% of those without disorders had 
contemplated killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Weissman, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia College of 
Physicians and Surgeons and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said the 
findings surprised her. So she explored whether other psychiatric conditions 
might explain the link to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
But a complex series of statistical analyses persuaded the researchers that the 
suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts were related to the panic attacks -- not 
to any depression, drug abuse or other conditions from which the people 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that panic disorder and attacks are associated with an increased 
risk of suicidal (thoughts) and suicide attempts," the group wrote. "Physicians 
working in general medical settings and emergency departments should be alert 
to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field emphasized that point. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a rare event when new and useful information about suicide appears in 
the medical literature," Dr. Peter Reich of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology wrote in an accompanying editorial in the journal. 
</P>
<P>
Reich said the finding "deserves widespread attention" and "may provide general 
physicians with new opportunities to prevent suicide by recognizing and 
treating panic disorder." 
</P>
<P>
Reich, who called panic disorder "a relatively new concept in medicine," said 
many physicians may be unfamiliar with the condition. They "may not appreciate 
the intense distress associated with panic attacks," and patients may be 
unwilling to discuss them in detail. 
</P>
<P>
But recurrent attacks can leave patients demoralized and isolated, unable to 
conduct a normal life. By diagnosing the disorder and explaining to the patient 
that the cause may be biological, a physician can bring the patient some 
relief, Reich said.

U.S., MEXICO QUASH MONEY-LAUNDERING RING LINKED TO COLOMBIAN DRUG LORDS

A Colombian who allegedly led a ring that laundered as much as $70 million in 
drug proceeds and shipped a ton of cocaine to Southern California each month is 
in U.S. custody, while 12 people identified as accomplices are being held in 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Fernando Mejia Pelaez, 50, was arrested at a San Diego-area motel last 
Thursday. He is charged with 174 counts of making false statements and failure 
to file currency transaction reports, assistant U.S. attorney L. J. O'Neale 
said Wednesday. Mejia has been a federal fugitive since 1986, when he was 
indicted along with eight other people on money-laundering charges, O'Neale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mexican police, Mejia headed an organization that laundered 
between $60 million and $70 million a month. The ring allegedly used three auto 
dealerships and two currency exchange houses in Mexico to launder money for 
Colombian drug lords. Mexican officials said that the ring also used banks in 
New York, Miami, Tampa, Fla., and Panama to launder drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican authorities described the arrests, which they said resulted from a 
joint investigation by U.S. and Mexican police, as a major blow to Colombia's 
Medellin drug cartel. The 12 people arrested in Tijuana include three women and 
three Colombian males. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia is being held without bail in San Diego at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center and has a court appearance scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
When arrested, Mejia was carrying a Mexican driver's license with a Tijuana 
address and a Colombian passport, O'Neale said. Mejia also had U.S. tourist and 
business visas that were issued to him in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neale added that Guillermina Watson was named in the same indictment with 
Mejia and was convicted in 1987 on 206 counts of currency violations. Watson, 
who was an officer at the now-closed Bank of America branch in Coronado, was 
sentenced to five years in federal prison and is the only person named in the 
indictment who has gone to trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, stung by widespread charges of corruption and 
incompetence, clung precariously to power Wednesday, barely defeating a 
parliamentary motion of no confidence that would have brought down her year-old 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 237 members of Parliament, 107 voted to support the motion of no 
confidence, 12 short of the 119 needed; 125 voted with Bhutto, and five were 
absent. It was the most serious challenge to Bhutto since she was swept to 
power last November in Pakistan's first popular elections after more than a 
decade of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
As she left the National Assembly, Bhutto's supporters showered her with rose 
petals. But independent analysts and leaders of the political opposition said 
that despite the vote, Bhutto is still deeply mired in controversy and crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto herself, at a press conference, seemed more troubled than triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is time for reflection," she said, "reflection by the government 
and by the moderate opposition. The no-confidence motion should have given 
everyone food for thought." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to charges that members of the assembly had been kidnaped and bribed 
by both parties to ensure their votes, she said that such behavior "discredits 
the democratic and political process." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bhutto's party rounded up many of its members in the assembly and 
flew them in air force planes to a remote mountain retreat in an effort to 
ensure their loyalty. The opposition took similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
"When we hear of such horse trading . . . it is democracy and Parliament itself 
which are undermined," she said. "So we are all losers." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto conceded that her party has made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not angels," she said, adding that she will reorganize her Cabinet and 
expand the political base of her Pakistan People's Party after meeting with 
moderate elements of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But she insisted that she still has the support of most Pakistanis. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders disputed this. Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, who heads a loose 
coalition known as the Combined Opposition Parties, said exultantly that the 
opposition "has achieved a major victory." 
</P>
<P>
"The slim margin with which the prime minister has escaped ouster demonstrates 
the strength and unity of the opposition," he said. "The most unpopular and 
incompetent government in Pakistani history cannot survive for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Another opposition leader, Mian Nawaz Sharif, who coordinated the parliamentary 
effort to unseat Bhutto, pledged to redouble the effort to bring down the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"When the margin is so narrow," he said in an interview, "anything can happen, 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and independent analysts confirmed that the opposition has gained 
ground. By getting 107 of the 237 legislators to back the no-confidence motion, 
the opposition added 45 votes to the seats it won in last year's election. With 
12 more votes, they noted, Bhutto's government would have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the reason for Bhutto's diminishing support, in the assembly 
and among the populace, is her government's apparent inability to govern, along 
with persistent but unconfirmed charges that members of her family are involved 
in corrupt practices. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani and foreign analysts say the Bhutto government has not enacted any 
significant legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rancor, both sides applauded when the two-hour assembly session 
ended. Leaders on both sides agreed that in this country where power has 
changed hands more often by coup than by political process, the mere fact that 
the vote had taken place was a victory for democracy.

CHINA: LEADERS IN BEIJING ARE TOLD THAT THE TWO NATIONS SHOULD NOT LET ENDLESS

<P>
Former President Richard M. Nixon, speaking at a farewell banquet Wednesday 
evening, told his Chinese hosts that the June crackdown on pro-democracy 
protests "will inevitably color American opinion and behavior toward China." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that many in the United States, including many friends of China, 
believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Nixon said in a toast to 
Chinese President Yang Shangkun, one of the key people responsible for ordering 
troops into Beijing to crush the protests. "The events . . . damaged the 
respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon acknowledged that "many Chinese leaders deeply believe that the American 
reaction represents an intrusion in their internal affairs," adding: "The 
age-old clash of ideas that now divides our nations is clear: the assertion of 
sovereignty of the state versus the universal rights of man." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, a copy of whose speech was made available to the foreign press, said 
that U.S. sanctions against China and criticism of the crackdown have caused 
Chinese leaders to "recall bygone days when their nation was bullied and 
exploited by outside powers." 
</P>
<P>
"As a result," he said, "some Chinese now exhibit a distrust of the United 
States that is reminiscent of the period before 1972. The death of innocent 
people was a great tragedy, but another tragedy would be the death of a 
relationship and of policies that have served so well. We must not permit our 
real enemies -- misunderstanding, fruitless resentment, endless recrimination 
-- to close the door we opened with such high hopes 17 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, who is to leave China today after a six-day visit, said that after 20 
hours of "frank and wide-ranging" discussions with Chinese leaders, he still 
cannot say with certainty whether China will continue to move forward with 
reforms or whether it will again close its doors and "revert to the stagnant 
situation that existed before." 
</P>
<P>
Yang, in a toast to Nixon, declared that "Sino-U.S. relations are at a most 
difficult juncture, or, in other words, at a stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
"This state of affairs is not of China's making," Yang said. "China's U.S. 
policy remains the same. . . . It is the United States that has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Yang, whose remarks were summarized in a report by the official New China News 
Agency, said China has done nothing to hurt American interests or to impose its 
views and values on the United States, yet in recent months some Americans have 
become involved in China's internal affairs and have judged events in China by 
American standards. 
</P>
<P>
"They have forgotten," he said, "the lesson of history: Only after waging an 
extremely arduous struggle for over a century did the Chinese people finally 
win their basic rights -- the independence of the state and the dignity of the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
An American traveling with Nixon, who briefed reporters on the condition that 
he not be identified by name, said that Nixon has privately offered Chinese 
leaders several ideas on measures China might take to help restore friendlier 
ties. He said they include steps in the fields of commercial relations, human 
rights and educational exchanges. Specifically, he said, Nixon suggested that 
police stationed outside the U.S. Embassy stop carrying semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Nixon chatted with pedestrians along a shopping street, 
then visited the U.S. Embassy for a noon speech to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, for the first time since June, the guards with rifles had 
been withdrawn from outside the embassy, and they were also gone Wednesday. 
Embassy officials expressed optimism that they had been removed permanently. 
Guards armed with pistols remained on duty.

SALINAS, AMID JEERS, DEFENDS HIS ECONOMIC PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO: THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST STATE-OF-THE-NATION ADDRESS ALSO CRITICIZES BIG 
GOVERNMENT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a display of Mexico's growing political pluralism, President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari delivered his first state-of-the-nation speech Wednesday amid jeers 
from hostile lawmakers, then flew to this northern city to attend the 
inauguration of the country's first opposition governor. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas made a dramatic break with the past during his nationally televised 
speech, criticizing the big, paternalistic government that emerged from the 
1910 Mexican Revolution and has prevailed for the last 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
The president defended his controversial economic "modernization" program, 
which has allowed the sale of valuable state enterprises once considered 
untouchable. He said the role of the state now should be limited to defending 
the country's sovereignty and carrying out justice. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that in Mexico, a larger state has resulted in less capacity to 
respond to the social demands of our fellow citizens," Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The state concerned itself more with administering its properties than with 
meeting pressing social needs." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas also declared that the massive agrarian reform program that stemmed 
from the revolution is all but over. 
</P>
<P>
"Large-scale land distribution has been completed. Anyone who asserts that 
there are still millions of acres of land to be distributed is lying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Salinas addressed a joint session of Congress at the Palace of Fine Arts in 
Mexico City, more than 10,000 teachers, musicians and government health workers 
demonstrated outside for higher wages and union democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas was interrupted and booed at least 10 times during his two-hour speech 
by lawmakers from the left-of-center Democratic Revolutionary Party and small 
parties that oppose his economic program and charge that his government is 
undemocratic. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the lower-house Chamber of Deputies is made up of opposition 
members as a result of the 1988 national elections in which the official 
Institutional Revolutionary Party received its lowest vote ever in 60 years of 
rule. That event has changed the face of politics in Mexico, allowing for 
once-unheard-of practices such as jeering the president's annual speech. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas praised the clean gubernatorial election in Baja California, which gave 
victory to the conservative National Action Party's candidate, Ernesto Ruffo 
Appel, while National Action legislators chanted, "Ruffo! Ruffo!" 
</P>
<P>
A former mayor of Ensenada, Ruffo beat the ruling party's candidate in a hotly 
contested election last July. Salinas' national party chairman recognized the 
opposition victory over the protests of state party officials. 
</P>
<P>
National Action also won the mayoralties of Tijuana and Ensenada, but the 
ruling party, called PRI, held on to Tecate and the state capital, Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo attended the president's speech in Mexico City. The two of them then flew 
aboard the president's plane to Mexicali to attend Ruffo's inauguration for a 
six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo took his oath of office in a state auditorium amid the deafening cheers 
of thousands of supports. Addressing Salinas, Ruffo said, "We know we are 
beginning a new stage in the history of Mexico here and we sincerely want the 
best for our nation. . . . I believe you govern for all Mexicans as I will 
govern for all Baja Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, who lost Baja California in last year's presidential election, was 
greeted with a standing ovation. In a receiving line afterwards, hundreds of 
people shook his hand and thanked him for honoring the elections. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier, during Salinas' State of the Union speech speech, members of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party shouted, "What about Michoacan?" and "We 
repudiate electoral fraud!" 
</P>
<P>
Their party, led by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, accuses the government of stealing the 
Michoacan state legislative election on the same day as the Baja vote. National 
Action leaders also charge the government with fraud in the Mazatlan and 
Culiacan mayoral races last month in Sinaloa state. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Salinas applauded a controversial electoral reform package 
approved by the Congress last month that is supposed to ensure fair national 
elections in the future. He noted that for the first time, the PRI needed 
opposition support for the two-thirds majority required to pass a 
constitutional reform. 
</P>
<P>
National Action voted with the government party, but the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party charged that the reform accomplished nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Counter-reform!" they shouted as Salinas spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning their party by name, Salinas lambasted "small groups that 
dogmatically insist on all or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
National Action Party deputies apparently did not take part in the verbal 
hostility, but they refused to stand or applaud the president. 
</P>
<P>
Their congressional leader, Abel Vicencio Tovar, defended his party's support 
for slow, moderate reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"An all-or-nothing strategy has resulted in a history of leaping from failure 
to failure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas attempted to show that his economic reforms are paying off. His 
government has sold the nation's largest airline, Mexicana, as well as parts of 
the basic commodities company, Conasupo, and parts of the state telephone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
He is allowing private investment in petrochemicals production, although the 
national petroleum company, Pemex, remains in government hands. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas said the nation's economy grew 2.5% the first six months of the year, 
and he projected a year-end growth rate of 2.5% to 3%. He said inflation is 
running 17.3% annually -- a rate that he called the lowest in more than a 
decade. Mexico's foreign reserves are $7.3 billion. Salinas said his 
government's agreement with commercial banks to reduce a $100-billion foreign 
debt was "sufficient," but opposition legislators shouted their disagreement.

TALKS TO MAGNIFY MALTA'S MYSTIQUE; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: THROUGH THE CENTURIES, THE ISLAND NATION'S MAIN RESOURCE HAS BEEN 
GEOGRAPHY. INTRIGUE AND NEUTRALITY ACCOUNT FOR ITS MODERN APPEAL.

<P>
Independent and stridently neutral Malta, the base for the first 
American-Soviet seaborne summit meeting, is a fortress archipelago that insured 
the maritime power of Great Britain for more than a century, then lost its 
strategic importance in the decline of the British Empire and the dawn of the 
nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the tiny nation seems destined to enter the consciousness of Americans for 
the first time since John Huston directed his first movie, "The Maltese 
Falcon," in 1941. In a tense moment that has made film history, the Fat Man 
(Sydney Greenstreet) asks Humphrey Bogart, the star playing detective Sam 
Spade: "What do you know, sir, about the Order of the Hospital of St. John of 
Jerusalem?" 
</P>
<P>
"Crusaders or something," Bogart replies, and the spellbinding intrigue of 
ancient treasure quickly unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
As hordes of news reporters and photographers descend on Malta to cover the 
Dec. 2-3 meeting of President Bush and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev far offshore, Americans will discover that the three inhabited 
islands of Malta are still exotic, steeped in history and touched by intrigue. 
Although the falcons have been exterminated, the Order of St. John, which ruled 
Malta for more than two centuries, still exists, its three dozen or so members 
wearing their medieval robes and oddly shaped Maltese crosses. 
</P>
<P>
The intrigue even hints of terrorism. West German officials said only this week 
that they have come upon clues that link the destruction of the Pan American 
World Airways plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21 to a suitcase that 
came from an Air Malta flight. The suitcase may have been put aboard the Air 
Malta plane in Valletta, the capital of Malta, and transferred to the Pan Am 
plane in Frankfurt, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In another brush with terrorism, the Maltese government allowed Egyptian 
commandoes to storm an EgyptAir passenger plane that had been hijacked to 
Valletta in November, 1985. The assault was bungled, and 57 people died in the 
terrifying battle. 
</P>
<P>
Maltese officials infuriated the Reagan Administration in April, 1986, when 
they warned Libya that they had spotted American bombers flying overhead on the 
way to Tripoli and Benghazi. Since then, the Maltese have elected a more 
pro-Western government, led by Prime Minister Edward Fenech-Adami. 
</P>
<P>
But Fenech-Adami has still tried to maintain the neutralist position of Malta 
-- a stance that may help explain why Bush and Gorbachev agreed that the small 
republic could serve as a logistical base for the summit aboard their warships 
in the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason may be its magnificent harbor, a small bay alongside Valletta 
known as the Grand Harbor. Warships nestled in that harbor for centuries but no 
longer do. From the fortified Grand Harbor, the British navy could guard both 
sides of the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic and Aegean seas as well. In the 
19th Century, neither France, the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the Hapsburgs nor 
the Ottoman Empire of Turkey could control these waters so long as Britain 
controlled Malta. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic importance of Malta was so great that Hitler tried in vain to 
bomb it into submission during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Now British, German and Scandinavian tourists crowd the few beaches of the 
islands, and the Malta government hopes to attract a million tourists next 
year. That is three times the population of the republic itself. 
</P>
<P>
The 350,000 Maltese live on the 122 square miles of the three islands -- Malta, 
Gozo and Comino -- located south of Sicily, east of Tunisia and north of Libya. 
There are two other Maltese islands but they are not inhabited. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, Malta has been settled or conquered by Sicilians, 
Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Normans, French and British. The 
mixed population speaks a language that is three-quarters Semitic, mostly old 
Arabic, and a quarter Romance, mostly Italian. English, however, is recognized 
as an official language as well. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating history of Malta makes clear that its main resource has always 
been geography; its location creates a bridge between the Christian and Muslim 
worlds and between Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Christianity was introduced in Malta when St. Paul was shipwrecked there in the 
year 60. The Maltese are mainly Roman Catholic and boast that they attend 
church more regularly than any other people on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1530, Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire ceded Malta as a fief to 
the Knights of St. John, who had been evicted by the Turks from their base on 
the island of Rhodes. Their tribute to the emperor was a single falcon, to be 
given every year on All Saints Day. It was not a sculpted jewel-bedecked black 
bird of the John Huston movie and the Dashiell Hammett novel on which the movie 
was based, but a real falcon from the islands. 
</P>
<P>
The knights, who began as an order nursing Crusaders stricken en route to 
Jerusalem, later became a military order as well. They transformed Malta into a 
naval base and the southernmost bastion of Christianity in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon seized the islands in 1798 but surrendered them to the British two 
years later. Malta's strategic value was so great that Horatio Nelson, the 
British naval hero, wrote: "I hope we shall never give it up." 
</P>
<P>
Britain formally annexed it as a colony in 1814, building an enormous port in 
Grand Harbor and using it until recent times as the base for its Mediterranean 
fleet. British spending on the base insured economic prosperity for the 
Maltese. 
</P>
<P>
As the power of Britain waned and as naval dominance became far less important 
than nuclear dominance, the military significance of Malta diminished. In 1964, 
Britain granted the islands their independence. Malta, while remaining in the 
British Commonwealth, broke its ties to the Queen of England in 1974 and 
declared itself a republic. 
</P>
<P>
Although the British maintained the Grand Harbor as a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization naval base for several years after independence, it withdrew all 
its military forces in 1979. Malta then assumed its neutral role. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in British spending on the base after World War II insured a 
decline in prosperity, and there has been an extensive emigration from the 
islands for the last few decades. In 1954 alone, more than 11,000 Maltese, 3% 
of the total population, left the islands.

A major earthquake rocked northeastern Japan early today, and more than 6,000 
residents of a coastal area 300 miles northeast of Tokyo were evacuated as a 
precaution against seismic-caused waves, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
No major damage or casualties were reported, and the evacuation order was 
lifted after 3 1/2 hours as the danger of such waves, called tsunami, subsided. 
</P>
<P>
The quake, centered 18 miles below the seabed and 80 miles off Japan's main 
Honshu island, had a magnitude estimated at 7.1, the same as the Oct. 17 quake 
in the San Francisco Bay area.

KOHL, POLES AT ODDS OVER CHURCH VISIT

<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long-delayed visit to Poland has been 
thrown into doubt again, this time by Kohl's wish to attend Mass at a 
controversial site. 
</P>
<P>
The visit, scheduled to begin Nov. 9, was conceived as a gesture of aid and 
reconciliation but has been postponed repeatedly because of wrangling here over 
the extent of the aid to be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Now the West Germans and the Poles are at odds over Kohl's plan to attend Mass 
at Annaberg, or St. Anne's Hill, in German-speaking Silesia. Poland's Prime 
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki opposes the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Kohl's office said Wednesday that Kohl had discussed the matter with 
Mazowiecki on Tuesday but that they had failed to resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Silesia is the area in southwestern Poland that was taken from Germany when the 
map of East Europe was redrawn after World War II. Annaberg, the site of a 
Polish uprising against German rule in 1921, is of symbolic importance to both 
countries. In the years since World War II, it has become a gathering place for 
ethnic Germans in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Alfons Nossol said that the church at Annaberg, which is in his diocese, 
is the only one in Poland that conducts Roman Catholic Mass in German. He has 
invited Kohl to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop, interviewed on West German television, said Kohl would be received 
warmly and would be expected to discuss the "complicated Silesian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Silesian refugees in West Germany have formed a lobbying association that meets 
regularly and encourages politicians to seek the return of Silesia to German 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of restoring Silesia to Germany has found support among West Germany's 
right-wing political parties, including the Republicans party, and this will 
pose a threat to Kohl's Christian Democrats in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party, has 
warned Kohl against including the visit to Annaberg on his itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid," Vogel said, "that this could cast a shadow over this important 
and necessary visit. I would advise the greatest care and sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kohl said he will take up the matter with Mazowiecki again, but 
added, "The chancellor still wishes to go to Annaberg."

RACE, LEADERSHIP ARE KEY N.Y. CAMPAIGN ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: DINKINS IS HURT BY DOUBTS THAT HE CAN COPE WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND 
CRISES. HIS LEAD IN THE MAYORAL CONTEST NARROWS.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the windows of the penthouse high above Manhattan, the guests could see 
the spectacular shimmering lights of skyscrapers and bridges glowing in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But the audience in the room had little interest in the view that has inspired 
generations of artists as diverse as George Gershwin and Woody Allen. They had 
come to be reassured, and it was the task of Democratic mayoral candidate David 
N. Dinkins, wearing a hand-woven yarmulke, to allay their fears. 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Robert Abrams, New York State's attorney general, had spoken 
on Dinkins' behalf to the group of rabbis and Jewish community leaders, a 
crucial constituency. 
</P>
<P>
He told how Dinkins, who is seeking to be the city's first black mayor, was a 
strong supporter of Israel and human rights and how the candidate had traveled 
with a delegation of prominent Jews to Bitburg to protest President Ronald 
Reagan's visit to a cemetery containing Nazi graves. 
</P>
<P>
When his turn came to speak, Dinkins said: "We are on the threshold of what I 
hope will be history. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the country and abroad, people are reading about this contest. I ask no 
one to vote for me because I am Afro-American. But I also ask no one to not 
vote for me because I am Afro-American." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins remarks were warm and personal, at times eloquent. But, after he had 
departed, skepticism remained with the half-empty trays of canapes. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of fear," a man said, spurning a fund-raising pledge card. 
"We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
"He comes off as a nice guy," added another guest. "I don't know if he comes 
off as a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Race and the quality of leadership are central issues as New Yorkers prepare to 
elect their 106th mayor next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough president, is opposed by former federal 
prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani in a contest that has grown tighter in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Issues have faded to secondary importance. Both Dinkins and Giuliani favor 
hiring more policemen to fight crime and drugs, both agree on the need to 
improve New York's air quality and to keep transit fares at current levels, if 
possible. The candidates agree that budgetary problems next year will sharply 
limit the chance for broad initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins continues to lead in the polls, riding a campaign of conciliation and 
civility that stresses his desire to serve as a unifier in a racially troubled 
city. 
</P>
<P>
But Dinkins, a 62-year-old clubhouse politician who has held only one previous 
municipal elective office, faces questions of whether he can cope in the 
crucible of uncertainties, rivalries and crises that shape the mayoralty of the 
nation's largest city. New York's 106th mayor will take office on Jan. 1 at a 
difficult time. If voters on Election Day approve, he will face a new city 
charter. The economy is cooling, fiscal problems are growing, and the expensive 
and socially wrenching dilemmas of drugs, AIDS and poverty await fresh 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
He will face the challenge of roads and bridges badly in need of repair, a 
public school system in need of reform, a middle class buffeted by high taxes 
and inefficient services, a set of difficult contract negotiations with the 
municipal unions. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show Dinkins' lead over Giuliani ranging from 4 to 18 points. But 
significant numbers of potential voters have been moving from the Democratic 
column to undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times voiced the discontent of many voters, lamenting the quality 
of the campaign when it tepidly endorsed Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
"The sorry nature of this contest makes a hard choice harder," the paper said. 
"Democrat Dinkins has shown little in the way of managerial skills; Republican 
Giuliani has demonstrated few political skills." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins "has a reputation for indecision and reinforced it during the 
campaign," the paper added, but "he understands New York's government, 
neighborhoods and people. He is not the ideal candidate but he is a good man 
likely to make a decent mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after a very shaky start, Giuliani's campaign finally has taken 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old former prosecutor with a national reputation for fighting 
white-collar crime on Wall Street, has tried to meet the racial issue head on. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that this contest should center on race is not fair to the 
voters. It's divisive. It panders to fear," Giuliani said in a speech this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani said that he was sensitive and understood the need for racial harmony, 
and, if elected mayor, would "have as great a responsibility . . . if not 
greater" than Dinkins to bring the city together. 
</P>
<P>
He has accused Dinkins of "sloppiness and indecision" and of "running away" 
from the city's projected $1-billion budget gap in the next fiscal year. And he 
has sought to cast Dinkins in the mold of the old politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that the voters want to continue a City Hall run by old, 
opportunistic, vested interests that have cast a thick cloud over how the city 
is run," the candidate tells audiences. "It is time to give our city new 
thinking, new energy, new commitments, new ways of dealing with problems. What 
David Dinkins offers is a return and continuation of the old way." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, who frequently promotes his own experience fighting crime and drugs, 
leads among white Catholics and divides the Jewish vote with Dinkins, according 
to some polls. 
</P>
<P>
But Giuliani still suffers from a perception that he is more a prosecutor than 
a prospective mayor. He was also hurt during the GOP primary by a constant 
bombardment of negative commercials by cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, who 
charged that Giuliani was not a true Republican because was also running on the 
Liberal Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say which voting groups turn out will be the critical. Registered 
Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a ratio of 5 to 1 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins hopes that traditional Democrats, particularly liberal Jewish voters 
and Latinos, will join his strong base of black support and that he will gain a 
large enough share of the white Catholic vote to put him over the top. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to energize those voters, Dinkins has campaigned with outgoing 
Mayor Edward I. Koch, whom he defeated in the Democratic primary, and other 
well known Democratic figures, such as New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and 
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins has also pledged that his Administration will be independent of the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who helped energize black voters in the primary but so far 
has played a far lesser role in Dinkins general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If I become mayor, I and I alone will be the mayor," the candidate reassures 
Jewish audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In a further effort at reassurance, Dinkins stresses his mainstream Democratic 
ties, promising that his council of economic advisers will include such 
financial leaders as Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, who played a 
prominent part helping solve New York's fiscal crisis two decades ago. Dinkins 
pledges he will insist that municipal unions supporting him become "partners 
for progress" in labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
As the contest has become closer, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's son, Andrew, who played 
a key role in his father's campaigns, has become a prominent strategist in the 
Dinkins campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Borough president's mainstream philosophy stems in good measure 
from his political mentor, J. Raymond Jones, the first black leader of Tammany 
Hall, the Manhattan Democratic organization. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' Carver Democratic Club in Harlem in the 1950s and 1960s was an incubator 
of political talent, nurturing not only Dinkins but such prominent black 
Democrats as Rep. Charles B. Rangel, former Manhattan Borough President Percy 
Sutton and former Deputy Mayor Basil Paterson. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins was introduced by his father-in-law, a Harlem politician, to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a person I would like to get behind," the former Tammany 
leader said in a phone interview from the Virgin Islands, where he is retired. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (David) is very smart. He benefits not only from experience but 
from contacts with other people. He listens. He is a good selector of ideas. He 
is very polite. That is traditional in the Carver (club)." 
</P>
<P>
Jones taught Dinkins and his other proteges that, to succeed downtown, the 
politics of inclusion was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured out a long time ago that one could not be successful in New York 
City unless you had an appreciation of all the groups in the communities," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had not gotten where I am had I not solidified my base and reached out to 
others," Dinkins tells voters. " . . . I've tried to concentrate on what brings 
us together." 
</P>
<P>
That unifying philosophy, plus a good dash of caution, have been steady threads 
running through Dinkins' two elected offices -- a single term as state 
assemblyman and Manhattan Borough president -- plus a number of somewhat 
ceremonial jobs gained with the help of New York's Democratic organization. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Dinkins has served as a Democratic district leader, head of the 
Board of Elections, City Clerk and a board member of the State Urban 
Development Corp. Some of these posts were part time, allowing him to practice 
law. Dinkins' wife, Joyce, whose father was a Harlem assemblyman, is 
coordinator of metropolitan affairs for the state Division of Taxation and 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in the Marines during World War II, Dinkins, whose father was a 
barber in Trenton, N.J., majored in mathematics at Howard University and was 
graduated with honors. In 1956, he received a law degree from New York Law 
School. The Marines and math have left their mark. At times, he can be very 
precise, correcting in private the grammar of his close friends. In the Marine 
tradition, he is impeccably dressed in public, changing his sharply-pressed 
dark suit several times on humid days. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins can also be imprecise. He was forced to withdraw as a deputy mayor in 
the Administration of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, after he disclosed to the 
City Department of Investigation on a routine background questionnaire that he 
had failed to file federal, state and city income taxes for four years. 
</P>
<P>
His explanation has remained constant over two decades. He said he was busy as 
a lawyer dealing with his clients' matters; a tax withholding form was filed 
along with the partnership form from his law firm. No criminal charges were 
brought and Dinkins paid all penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins' personal finances continued to cause political problems during the 
mayoral campaign. Questions were raised over the true value of stock in a media 
company headed by Sutton, his political patron, that Dinkins said he sold to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians who have worked with Dinkins over the years say more than some 
previous mayors, the quality of his deputy mayors and staff will be very 
important in determining the success of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a gentleman. He has an instinct for the common good, which bodes well. 
He does what he thinks is right. He has a controlled personality and people 
underestimate him," said a state official who has dealt with Dinkins on the 
local level. Yet, "he is not a high-pressure driven personality. You can't 
compare him to a mule in his talent for work. He will need good people around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a hard time making up his mind about decisions," added a lobbyist who 
has brought issues of land use before the borough president's office. "He has 
people on his staff who guide him toward the right decision. It will be an 
Administration of committees to tell him what to do. When he was thinking of 
running for mayor, he formed a committee to advise him what to do."

A controversial military research project that involves shooting hundreds of 
cats in the head will continue at least until the findings of a government 
investigation are released, the Army announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement of support for the project was issued as an animal protection 
group asked for a moratorium on the research project at Louisiana State 
University until a report on the Government Accounting Office's investigation 
is released. 
</P>
<P>
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine charged also that Rep. Bob 
Livingston (R-La.) was unnecessarily withholding the preliminary GAO findings 
on the $2.1-million project, in which cats are shot to learn more about head 
trauma to combat soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army continues to support the project at this time," Army spokesman Maj. 
Joe Padilla said, adding that "the findings of the GAO will be addressed by the 
Medical Research Command when the report is finalized and presented."

'THEY REALLY DID IT,' STAFF MEMBERS CRY AS THE NEWS SINKS IN

At 1 p.m. Wednesday, Robert J. Danzig, vice president of Hearst Corp., walked 
into the Herald Examiner city room. Dressed in a dark suit, he climbed atop a 
copy editor's desk. He stood silent for a moment, a piece of paper in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
A nervous buzz that had prevailed in the newsroom stopped. Reporters, 
photographers and editors gathered around the desk and waited to hear what 
Danzig, a stranger from New York, had come to tell them. Their collective 
experience told them the news would not be good. 
</P>
<P>
They had been summoned from various corners of the Herald Examiner building at 
11th and Broadway, from a bar across the street. One reporter had been drawn 
out of a Jimmy Carter press conference downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Knew' 
</P>
<P>
"I walked into the newsroom and I saw all the people gathered around," said 
Assistant City Editor Bill Johnson, who had hustled to the newsroom from the 
Hill Street Grill. "And I knew the paper was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Danzig began to read from the paper in his hand. His voice seemed sad, subdued. 
He stuck to the text. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles Herald Examiner will cease publication on Nov. 2," he read. 
"It is with great regret that we have made this decision to close the Herald 
Examiner."

<P>
Employees, who had long known this day would come, nonetheless were overcome 
with emotion. Some cried. Some workers just stared, while others grabbed each 
other tight -- like they were afraid to let go, of the newspaper and of each 
other. There was no gallows humor. 
</P>
<P>
Danzig read on. 
</P>
<P>
"We were unable to find a purchaser that could provide the financial capacity 
to sustain the business." 
</P>
<P>
Danzig spoke of the corporation's sadness at the decision, of how proud the 
executives in New York all were of the Herald and its staff. An employee cut to 
the essentials. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we come to work tomorrow?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Danzig said he didn't know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
After five minutes, the executive stepped down. Reporters ran to the phones 
calling up relatives, and they all seemed to utter the same thing into the 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it," they said. "They really did it." A typist started circulating a 
list, filled with the phone numbers and names of those who had worked for the 
paper and wanted to keep in touch. One sheet was almost covered by 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There were more tears after Danzig departed. 
</P>
<P>
"How," reporter Susan Seager asked, "am I going to feed my baby?" 
</P>
<P>
Through the afternoon, the sort of cynical humor typical of newspaper people 
began to creep into conversations. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so bad, said Andy Furillo, a reporter of eight years who followed his 
father's footsteps to the Herald, where he met his bride. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a wife out of the deal. How do you beat that?" he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Old stories of better days circulated, as they often do at wakes. Beer bottles 
began to pop up beside computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
The staff bulletin board began to fill with job notices from places as far away 
as White Plains, N.Y., and as near as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
As deadline approached, Assistant City Editor Kerry Webster wandered among the 
reporters who were preparing stories that told of their paper's demise. 
</P>
<P>
"OK everybody," said Webster. "Write like there's no tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't.

BEVERLY HILLS TEACHERS OK NEW PACT BY SLIM MARGIN 
</P>

<P>
After a rancorous, five-hour meeting, Beverly Hills teachers on Wednesday 
narrowly approved a two-year, 12% salary increase offer, ending the school 
system's first-ever strike. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered in a cavernous ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, the teachers voted 150 
to 133 to ratify the Beverly Hills Unified School District offer 13 days after 
walking out of their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Board of Education formally approved the contract offer 
shortly after the results of the teachers' vote were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the wage settlement is contingent upon the receipts of about $400,000 
pledged by local parents' groups for higher teacher salaries and on passage of 
a special parcel tax measure to be placed on the June ballot by the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have promised to raise up to $600,000. Any amount over the $400,000 
already pledged would be used to give district employees a bonus next year or 
to defray the cost of medical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the parcel tax would be used to add an additional 3% to the 
teachers' salary schedule in 1990-91, while the parents' money will be used to 
offer a 2% one-time bonus this year. The teachers' union and the district 
agreed that the bonus will go to all district employees. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning teachers' pay of $21,604 will rise to at least $28,041 this year, or 
as high as $28,575 with the parents' money. The current top pay of $46,270 will 
go to $48,584 this year, or $49,509 with the bonus. Next year, beginning pay 
will be at least $30,004, or go as high as $30,861 with the parcel tax money, 
while top pay would go to $51,985, or $53,470 if the tax passes. 
</P>
<P>
With those salaries, Beverly Hills teachers will earn about the same or 
slightly more than their counterparts in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, where a nine-day strike last May led to a 24% wage hike over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During the heated ratification meeting, teachers anguished over the district's 
proposal before voting by secret ballot, with those opposing it saying that too 
much of the money was contingent on the passage of the parcel tax measure. Few, 
if any, appeared thoroughly satisfied with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a victory, but it's over," said Bliss Trafton, a Horace Mann 
Elementary School teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Although she recommended ratification of the district offer, Judy McIntire, 
president of the Beverly Hills Education Assn., which represents the district's 
300 teachers, nurses, librarians and counselors, said later, "No one felt they 
had won. The money won't be enough to keep us competitive (with salaries paid 
in other districts). I don't know how teachers will feel about staying" in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Dana Tomarken acknowledged that the close ratification vote 
showed that "people are disappointed that the district is out of money. The day 
of reckoning is hard to face when you have the name Beverly Hills attached to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Parents who were involved in raising money for higher teachers salaries said 
they were pleased the strike was over. "We're happy that our children will get 
their teachers back," said Albert Gersten, a spokesman for the Children First 
parents' group formed after the strike began. But he said he did not believe 
the teachers "are really getting (paid) what they are worth." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas A. Micelli, an attorney and parent, said the settlement will be "a 
naked victory if we stop now. We must find a permanent solution, and that is 
the parcel tax."

HIGH COURT REJECTS SUIT ON TRIAL DELAYS 
</P>

The state Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an unusual lawsuit brought 
against more than 100 Los Angeles Superior Court judges charging them with 
improperly granting too many delays in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, brought by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, contended that the delays violated state law and 
contributed substantially to overcrowding in the county's 10 jails, where as 
many as one-third of the inmates may be awaiting trial at any time. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, the court declined 
to hear an appeal from the ACLU of a state appellate court ruling last August 
refusing to order the judges to change their policy on granting continuances. 
</P>
<P>
John Hagar, an attorney for the ACLU, said "serious consideration" will be 
given to raising the group's claims again in federal court. He noted that the 
suit had drawn support not only from defense lawyers but from several law 
enforcement officials as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We still believe that better control of continuances would be a major factor 
in reducing court congestion and would benefit inmates, witnesses and victims," 
Hagar said. "The wide support of law enforcement confirms that belief." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose amid widespread concern over jail overcrowding throughout the 
state, particularly in large urban counties. Los Angeles, like some other 
counties, is under a court order limiting to 22,000 the number of inmates it 
can incarcerate at one time. Since May, 1988, more than 140,000 inmates have 
been released early to meet the population limits. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU, representing jailed inmates, first brought suit in federal District 
Court last November, naming as defendants 101 judges who handle criminal cases 
in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charged that the judges were not following a 1985 state law that the 
ACLU said required judges to hold formal hearings on requests for continuances 
and, before approving such a delay, issue a formal finding that it is warranted 
by "good cause" and stating reasons for the action. 
</P>
<P>
In April, U.S. District Judge William P. Gray refused the case, saying the 
issue should be taken first to the state courts. "The state has got to have an 
opportunity to solve its own problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU then went to a state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, but the 
three-judge appellate panel declined to intervene in the trial court 
procedures, saying there was an "absence of facts" to support the ACLU's 
contentions. 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent petition for review to the state high court, the ACLU 
attorneys argued that repeated and routine continuances needlessly extended the 
length of pretrial confinement, adding congestion in the court system and 
overcrowding in the jails. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU drew support not only from the California Public Defenders Assn. but 
also several county officials, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman 
Block, who contended that repeated continuances granted by the judges had 
rendered the 1985 state law "legally meaningless." Such delays, Block said, 
placed added strain not only on the jails but also on the county's prisoner 
transportation system, by which 2,000 inmates must be taken to court daily. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the judges assailed the suit as "an ACLU-orchestrated political 
maneuver" and said the courts were being unfairly blamed for the failure of the 
sheriff and the Board of Supervisors to solve the problem of jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 law leaves it up to the judges to decide whether to hold formal 
proceedings for continuances, but any attempt to force them to do so would 
improperly interfere with the judges' inherent power to control their own 
calendars, attorneys for the judges said.

MOSES PENDLETON, MOMIX'S HUMAN KALEIDOSCOPE; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE-THEATER: THE WILY CHOREOGRAPHER "SOFTENS UP THE BEACHHEAD" FOR HIS 
SEVEN-MEMBER COMPANY.

Moses Pendleton can't help but be deceiving. Or double-edged. After all, he is 
the personification of trompe l'oeil. 
</P>
<P>
Now you see -- and understand -- him, now you don't. 
</P>
<P>
A human kaleidoscope of sorts -- first he co-founded Pilobolus, an antic zoo of 
a dance-theater collective, then he spawned Momix, an offshoot of the original 
-- the wily performer keeps reinventing himself. 
</P>
<P>
On this afternoon, for instance, with Momix set for a four-night stand at the 
Wiltern starting tonight, Pendleton tries to grab a few ebbing rays of sun 
poolside at the Hotel Bel Air -- not the usual digs for a choreographer whose 
seven-member troupe typically plays the low-scale college circuit. 
</P>
<P>
He stretches out on a chaise lounge, determined to gain a California tan and, 
at the same time, talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
But the compact 40-year-old -- who sports a black bikini, lots of silver rings, 
a brush-cut and goatee that point up his resemblance to Vincent van Gogh's 
self-portrait -- is restive. He talks in a torrent of free associations and 
playful puns. 
</P>
<P>
"Pale fire," he mutters, referring to the dimming sun and Nabokov's novel, 
while showing little sign of jet lag from his last destination, Rome. No matter 
that it is 3 p.m. and he has been conducting nonstop interviews since 11 a.m., 
with no end in sight before 8. 
</P>
<P>
There are things to do, and actual swans to contemplate at the hotel -- they 
glide about the mini-lake of this sylvan paradise. But he doesn't let pleasure 
(with a room that sets him back by $300 a day) interfere with the publicity 
process, even though he bolts from time to time for a fast spin on Mulholland 
in his rented Mazda convertible with surround-sound earphones in the headrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm self-producing the Wiltern engagement," he says, sliding over to a chair, 
wrapping himself in a hooded terry robe (now he looks like Gandhi) and sipping 
an espresso. "It's costing $75,000 up front, so this militaristic approach to 
publicity -- my softening up the beachhead -- is important." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, however, are the various deals Pendleton is trying to 
negotiate. While in Rome, appearing with his partner, Cynthia Quinn, on a 
program called "Stars of the International Ballet," he met with film director 
Lina Wertmuller. 
</P>
<P>
Movies are definitely in the picture these days. Pendleton provided 
choreography for Prince's "Batman" video and, a few years ago, the Julian 
Lennon video "Too Late for Goodbyes." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working on stories now," he says, borrowing as a pun the title of Oscar 
Levant's book "Memoirs of an Amnesiac." (Others, of his own devising, include 
"Venus Envy," on the Wiltern bill, and "Debut C," subtitled "Afternoon of a 
Prawn," a Pilobolus premiere coming to Royce Hall in February.) 
</P>
<P>
When Pendleton points to the Marx Brothers and theatrical revolutionary Antonin 
Artaud as his lifelong influences, he gives a clear clue not only to what 
Pilobolus and Momix are but also the other creative directions he takes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, his dossier itself reflects an unusual scope, as do his many and 
diverse prizes. At the time that the Russian avant-garde director Yuri Lyubimov 
went to see Momix in Milan (1981), he was getting ready to stage 
"Khovanshchina" for La Scala Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Inspired, I suppose, by what he saw," says Pendleton, "he had this intense 
idea to add me to the libretto as a silent character called Mimo. In fact, I 
was threaded from scene to scene and the Italian press was scandalized. 'What 
is this Woody Allen character doing in the middle of "Khovanshchina?" they 
wanted to know.' " 
</P>
<P>
But a year later the Deutsche Oper of Berlin commissioned him to choreograph 
and perform in "Tutuguri," Wolfgang Bihm's opera about Artaud exorcising demons 
by way of peyote. And then for four consecutive years there has been Italy's 
RAI television, with a whole sequence of Pendleton specials for the network. 
</P>
<P>
Of his different experiences, the Dartmouth graduate (English literature) 
quips: "I'm just a kebab on a skewer, but I must be more obscure." 
</P>
<P>
And he is. But somewhere in the course of germinating ideas and carrying them 
out he gets caught in what seems like a contradiction. The modus operandi of 
Pilobolus and Momix has been collaborative, with members freely bouncing off 
each other's whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, though, they suffer creative collisions -- thus explaining the 
constant change of personnel. Both companies, as though composed of megaspore 
mother cells that divide and multiply, "keep needing more space and oxygen," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, to put it in different terms: There should be an eruption every 10 years. 
That way we have new lava formations. Reading them is the most fun of all. 
These swans, for instance, could they be telling me to propose something to the 
Joffrey Ballet?" 
</P>
<P>
If so, "Swan Lake" will probably never be the same.

Mohammed Ali Marzouqi was killed to avenge the beheading of 16 convicted 
terrorists in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 21. Marzouqi, 68, was the personnel officer 
at the Saudi Embassy in Damascus, Syria.

Police have appealed to the public for help in identifying the abductor and 
killer of 7-year-old Ysidro (Punky) Valles, who vanished from his Sacramento 
home two months ago. The boy's body was found near the Sacramento Yacht Club by 
a person searching for wild asparagus, authorities said. Sacramento police said 
injuries to the body led them to classify the death as a homicide. The 
4-foot-5-inch, 81-pound boy was the object of a lengthy search by police, 
relatives, private groups and the FBI. Police appealed for information from 
anyone who may have seen a person with a child between Aug. 27 and 
mid-September in the area where the body was found.

An aftershock of the devastating Oct. 17 earthquake jolted Northern California 
from San Francisco Bay to Watsonville. The magnitude 4.4 aftershock was felt in 
San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. There were no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries. "It rattled pretty good at first and then kept on kind of 
rolling. You could feel the foundation swaying," said Watsonville resident Ani 
LeRitz-Murphy. "It's been the second longest one we've had since the big 
quake." The aftershock at 9:50 p.m. Wednesday was centered slightly north of 
the epicenter of the magnitude 7.1 main temblor, according to the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Menlo Park. Of the thousands of aftershocks, 84 have 
measured at least magnitude 3.0, and 21 registered magnitude 4.0 or greater. 
The strongest was 5.2, just 37 minutes after the initial jolt.

Park rangers are using radar guns, roofing nails have been spread across 
roadways and horses startled by speeding bicyclists have bucked their riders. 
All are signs of the increasing tensions and interactions between hikers, 
bicyclists and equestrians trying to share countryside trails in the Golden 
Gate Recreation Area in Marin County. "As far as I'm concerned, it's Russian 
roulette out there," said Linda Rubio, an equestrian who rides the trails. "My 
only hope is that something is done before someone really gets hurt." Rubio 
said she has had several run-ins with bikers, including an incident two years 
ago in which she was bucked and knocked unconscious after a mountain biker 
spooked her horse.

The Immigration Reform Act of 1986 has led to discrimination against minority 
job applicants because employers are afraid of being penalized if they do not 
detect illegal aliens in their work forces, a coalition of minority groups 
said. The Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights called on Congress to 
eliminate sanctions for employers who hire illegal aliens. The group pointed to 
a San Francisco survey that found half of all employers feel it is risky to 
hire people who speak limited English, because they might not be legal 
citizens. Employers who fail to adequately check the status of their workers 
are subject to fines of up to $2,000 per worker for the first offense.

SEISMIC REPAIR AND SOLID WASTE PROVIDE CITY COUNCIL A CAUTIOUS PLOT FOR DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This new series will give a curious twist to your daily TV highlights: 
</P>
<P>
"The Council Takes Up Residential Seismic Repair." 
</P>
<P>
Or, "The Council Checks Out the Solid Waste Program Status Report." 
</P>
<P>
Those were Wednesday's listings as the Los Angeles City Council, barely 209 
years after our town was founded, began gavel-to-gavel coverage on the new L.A. 
Cityview 35 cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
It plays on eight cable systems on Channel 35. Coverage will run live and in 
color Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at about 10 a.m. (Give them a few 
minutes; promptness is not the council's long suit.) The sessions replay those 
nights at 6. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you miss important goings-on, you can show up at the city clerk's office 
and watch a rerun. Or you can buy videocassette copies for $25. 
</P>
<P>
It was a cautious debut. Councilman Robert Farrell showed up 10 minutes early 
and wondered if the cameras were on to show him as an early arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The hot new bulbs poured out full wattage. Six robotic cameras watched from the 
ceiling, operated by an absentee crew in a fourth-floor hovel somewhere above 
the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody looked good. Cleaned and pressed. A lot of camera-ready gray and blue 
ensembles. Mighty nice smiles. Strong postures. Good comportment. 
</P>
<P>
But knowing the nature of such arenas, the compelling charm of such "shows" 
throughout the country is that they are, effectively, a circus waiting to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Not this day. It was sweetness and light, peaches and cream, ham and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
The city logo shone over a wide-angle shot of the great hall. At the bottom of 
the screen crawled civic bulletins like where to call for recycling information 
or the rent control hot line number or "Be somebody, be a cop." 
</P>
<P>
A meager 10 minutes late, Council President John Ferraro called the meeting to 
order. His head was reflecting a lot of glow, due to insufficient hair and lack 
of light-retardant makeup. 
</P>
<P>
He picked his ear and rubbed his eye and instructed colleague Joan Milke Flores 
to invoke the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
Employing the strange, oblique language of public officials on public business, 
the session droned on. Hal Bernson was wearing a lovely gray-striped suit with 
a handsome paisley tie and spoke with authority. Farrell, likewise in pins, was 
handsome, even dashing. Gloria Molina, in a purple dress with a terrific print 
scarf over her shoulder, was assertive -- but used her hands too much. (Bad TV 
form.) 
</P>
<P>
Nate Holden likewise glistened in the lights but otherwise looked splendid in a 
soft-gray suit and a blue-streaked tie. Marvin Braude looked good enough but 
was much too much serious on solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of good "character" in the cast, although Zev Yaroslavsky, a 
hearty combatant, was ill and absent Wednesday. Council watchers feel that he 
will be good for sparks as the series evolves. 
</P>
<P>
Ernani Bernardi comes out of left field. Like why call some of these streets 
smart corridors: "We haven't been very smart in handling our traffic," he said. 
"Is that (the word smart) an insult or what is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Smart was jargon and came from the placement of a lot of high-tech traffic 
electronics along certain superstreets. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro noted with a sly smile: "We gotta get smart councilmen for smart 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Galanter took the mike and referred to those traffic lights that turn red 
just as you get there: "The smart street," she said, "is when the light is 
smart enough to figure out that most of the traffic is with you and turns 
green." 
</P>
<P>
A few people in the studio (i.e., council chambers) audience applauded the 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ferraro, twinkling, "You're getting a sitting ovation, Ruth."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH WON'T GET TRAILERS FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trailers for homeless families will not be allowed on the grounds of a 
Sepulveda church, the Los Angeles City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda Unitarian-Universalist Society applied more than a year ago to 
have two city-owned mobile homes moved onto church property near Haskell Avenue 
and Plummer Street. The trailers are part of a city program to provide 
temporary housing for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
But the council voted 8 to 5 in support of efforts by church neighbors to block 
the trailers. That move overruled an earlier vote by the Board of Zoning 
Appeals that had approved the trailer proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Church neighbors who opposed the plan said their area is too remote from jobs 
and other services that the homeless might need. They also said they feared for 
their children's safety and their own security. 
</P>
<P>
Church representatives said those fears are ill-founded.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF WARNS DEPUTIES ABOUT ACTIVIST'S 
'STINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block has warned Los Angeles County deputies to beware of a 
former Hawthorne police officer whose videotaped "stings" of officers have 
angered law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Block, in a memorandum to sheriff patrols, alerted deputies about any "contact 
with Don Jackson" after the activist attempted to conduct a sting operation 
last Friday against sheriff's deputies in the Lennox area. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 31, who says police often use excessive force against minorities, 
confirmed Wednesday that he and a passenger armed with a videotape camera drove 
through that area in the early morning to see if deputies would stop them 
without cause. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Jackson said he was stopped that night by California Highway Patrol 
officers who accused him of weaving across the double-yellow line. Jackson said 
he was stopped illegally -- a claim that a CHP spokesman later disputed. 
Jackson was given a field sobriety test before being released. 
</P>
<P>
That incident prompted Block's memorandum warning deputies of Jackson's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he intends to continue his efforts to "send a message to law 
enforcement that these illegal stops will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew 
surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to 
slam Jackson's head through a shop window after a traffic stop.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE SUSPENDS JAIL TERM FOR CYNDY GARVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles judge Wednesday suspended a 126-day jail sentence for Cyndy 
Garvey, the ex-wife of former baseball star Steve Garvey who spent a night in 
jail last month for violating a child visitation order. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild reinstated probation for Garvey, saying 
she would make a final ruling on the sentence at a Dec. 8 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey was found guilty last month of 42 counts of contempt in "willfully" 
violating a court order that permitted her ex-husband to visit his daughters, 
Krisha, 14, and Whitney, 13. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Steve Garvey also was granted joint custody of the girls, who live 
with their mother in Malibu. Steve Garvey hosts a San Diego radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cyndy Garvey nor her ex-husband would comment on Wednesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild said that if Cyndy Garvey complies with visitation and custody 
orders, the jail sentence could be annulled. Under the visitation order, the 
girls are to spend each Tuesday afternoon and every other weekend with their 
father. 
</P>
<P>
The Garveys were divorced in 1981.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIM CONSERVATION EFFORTS AT LEADERS, CARTER 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter, addressing an environmental conference in Los 
Angeles, said Wednesday that Western countries can help developing nations 
conserve their natural resources only after persuading their leaders that 
conservation will best meet the needs of their nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any sense of impending doom, of giving up, of saying, 'We can't 
change things,' " Carter said. "I think things can be changed. . . . The Third 
World is not a hopeless case." 
</P>
<P>
He singled out Nicaragua as a possible recipient for environmentally sound 
assistance from developed nations. Once Nicaragua has free elections, he said, 
"the world ought to have a responsibility to rebuild what has been destroyed by 
an outside-financed war." Carter criticized some U.S. efforts to assist 
developing nations as "inept," saying too much of the aid goes to pay for 
administrative overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Carter spoke at a conference sponsored by the Global Tomorrow Coalition, an 
umbrella group of major environmental and population control groups.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COSTUMED YOUTHS TRICK STORE, STEAL TREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 25 youths dressed in costumes took nearly $600 in small electronic 
equipment from a Silver Lake electronic store Tuesday night, but the store 
manager was unable to describe any of the youths to police because of the 
disguises. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Radio Shack store at 3733 Sunset Blvd. told police that the 
youths came in at 6 p.m. and shouted, "Trick or treat," then dispersed 
throughout the store and grabbed $580 worth of equipment, including cassettes 
and cordless phones. The shoplifters ran out of the store, investigators said.

GROUP DEFIES ORDER TO STOP FEEDING POOR; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: CELEBRITIES HELP ANTI-HUNGER ACTIVISTS CONTINUE FOOD PROGRAM AT A 
WEST HOLLYWOOD PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a cabal of celebrities dishing up soup from the back of a truck to more 
than a hundred homeless people, a West Hollywood food giveaway group defied a 
city order to vacate Plummer Park on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition vowed Monday it would not shut down 
the program, which received $29,000 in city funding this year, even though the 
city recently told it the program would end as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Locked out of the city-owned kitchen they had used for the last year, coalition 
volunteers prepared the Wednesday meal in a church kitchen several blocks away, 
then served it in the park's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is, this is where we started," said volunteer Ted Landreth, 
referring to the program's start in a West Hollywood church three years ago. 
"Then the city had us come here (the park) because of complaints. We were told 
we were protected here, that this was a public place." 
</P>
<P>
A few city representatives stood on the outskirts of the news camera lights, 
watching the first giveaway in violation of the city order, but no action was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to formally vote on the fate of the program at 
its meeting Monday and is expected to dismantle the giveaway and rescind 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
City support for the program has faded in recent months in the wake of reports 
of violence, intimidation and unsanitary conditions at the park giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
"I have told staff to let them serve until Monday. They will have access to 
their (equipment) inside until then," said Lloyd Long, director of human 
services for the city. "We will recommend the council fund them for 30 more 
days for incurred expenses, then use the remaining money to buy food vouchers 
for people in the city's warming center (at West Hollywood Park)." 
</P>
<P>
People in the long line waiting to be served by such celebrities as actors 
Martin Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips and Katey Sagal seemed less intrigued by the 
star status of their hosts than did the circling cameramen. Most quietly 
shuffled through the long line talking with each other, and a few acknowledged 
the actors with comments like, "Hey, I love your work." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those in line praised the stars behind the ladles. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, they don't have to be out here; they've got food on their tables. I 
really appreciate their being here," said one diner, Dale Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promise from city staff members that they would have access to 
equipment inside park buildings, the facilities Wednesday were Spartan. 
City-owned tables the group previously had used were locked inside, and food 
had to be unloaded from two trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those difficulties, both celebrity and coalition volunteers vowed to 
continue serving at the site.

MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS WIND UP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors concluded their closing arguments Wednesday in the record-breaking 
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, urging jurors to convict two former 
teachers of molesting 11 of their pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders will instruct the jury of 
eight men and four women this afternoon, after which deliberations will begin. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding, now in its third year, is the longest and costliest criminal 
trial in U.S. history. Since first being filed in 1984, the case has cost Los 
Angeles County residents more than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, in her final summation, urged the jury to 
believe the children who claimed that they were molested by former preschool 
teachers Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62. 
</P>
<P>
She also urged the panel to convict the two defendants of one count of 
conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation for allegedly sexually abusing 11 
of their pupils at the now-closed Virginia McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan 
Beach from 1978 until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I submit to you that the children have told the truth," Rubin said. "They 
bottled it up inside for a long time, but they had the courage to sit up on 
that witness stand and recount how they were molested by Raymond and Peggy 
Buckey at the McMartin Pre-School. 
</P>
<P>
"What these teachers did to these children is really unfathomable," the 
prosecutor said. "It's hard to believe. But behind the facade of what was 
supposed to be a loving, kind preschool was a place that was really pretty 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the Buckeys could be sent to state prison for the rest of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, who have steadfastly maintained their clients' innocence, 
concluded their closing arguments last week. 
</P>
<P>
The defense essentially argued that the children were manipulated by 
prosecution social workers into falsely claiming that they were molested. 
</P>
<P>
When filed in 1984, the case was the largest molestation case in U.S. history. 
Since then, however, scores of charges and five co-defendants have been 
dismissed because of insufficient evidence.

HORSE RACING: FAVORITES BAYAKOA, ZILZAL AND EL SENOR MUST TRY TO OVERCOME 
UNFAVORABLE POST POSITIONS IN SATURDAY'S RACES.

<P>
Three of the seven favorites in Saturday's $10-million Breeders' Cup races will 
have to overcome unfavorable post positions on Gulfstream Park's peculiar 
course. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 89 horses were entered Wednesday in the sixth annual Breeders' Cup. 
Three horses each in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and Turf Stakes are on the 
also-eligible list, because fields are limited to 14 starters, so it's likely 
that only 83 horses will run. 
</P>
<P>
The morning-line favorites are Easy Goer at 6-5 in the Classic, El Senor at 3-1 
in the Turf, Zilzal at 9-5 in the Mile, Bayakoa at 6-5 in the Distaff, On the 
Line at 7-2 in the Sprint, the entry of Adjudicating and Rhythm at 5-2 in the 
Juvenile, and Stella Madrid at 5-2 in the Juvenile Fillies. The races are worth 
$1 million apiece, except for the $3-million Classic and the $2-million Turf. 
</P>
<P>
Favorites that will have to be at their very best because of the luck of the 
draw include Bayakoa, considered the best filly or mare in the country; Zilzal, 
undefeated and given the best chance of winning among the European entries, and 
El Senor, who has had traffic problems and wide trips in several of his 
non-winning races. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa drew post No. 1 in the 10-horse Distaff; Zilzal will break from No. 10 
in the 13-horse Mile, and El Senor is on the outside in the Turf, which has a 
capacity of 14 starters. 
</P>
<P>
The two horse-of-the-year candidates that will account for most of the betting 
in the Classic will be as far away from each other as they can be at the start 
of the race, with Easy Goer coming out of the No. 1 stall and Sunday Silence 
breaking from No. 8. California-based Sunday Silence, who beat Easy Goer in the 
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and then ran second to his New York rival in 
the Belmont Stakes, is listed as the 2-1 second choice in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence likes to be close early, and Easy Goer prefers putting in a late 
run. It would seem that Easy Goer might suffer from the inside post, where 
there is always the chance of getting shuffled back for the run down the 
backstretch, but the Classic has a relatively small field, and Shug McGaughey, 
who trains the colt, said he is happy with the position. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Croll, who is starting Arlington Lassie winner Trumpet's Blare in the 
Juvenile Fillies, has trained horses at Gulfstream for more than 25 years and 
is familiar with the track, which has tight turns, an unbanked grass course and 
a new dirt racing surface that concerned trainers last week. The main track got 
better by the weekend but may change again if the predicted scattered 
thundershowers occur today and Friday. Gulfstream's main track is a mile in 
circumference, and the turf course is seventh-eighths of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Post positions are important in mile races on grass and mile-and-sixteenth 
races on dirt here," Croll said. "If you draw outside, you can lose a lot of 
ground around the first turn." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the 2-year-old races -- the Juvenile and the Juvenile fillies -- are at 
1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The reason a No. 1 post might be all right for Easy Goer in the 1 1/4-mile 
Classic and not for Bayakoa in the 1 1/8-mile Distaff is that Bayakoa is a 
front-running mare. Outside her will be other speed horses -- Highest Glory, 
Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and Winning Colors -- all of whom are capable 
of crowding Bayakoa going into the first turn. If Bayakoa is not a factor in 
the early pace, the victory chances improve for the late-running Open Mind, the 
best 3-year-old filly in the country, and Goodbye Halo. 
</P>
<P>
The hot-blooded Bayakoa has lost only twice in 10 starts this year. In one 
loss, she broke from the No. 2 post and was unable to get rolling early; in the 
other, she was in the first stall and broke through the gate while waiting for 
the other horses to load. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas, who trains Highest Glory, Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and 
Open Mind, has 11 Breeders' Cup starters and is happy with all of the post 
positions they drew. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' Steinlen, the 4-1 second choice behind Zilzal in the Mile, has a chance 
to win the national grass title for males with a victory Saturday. Steinlen, 
who will break from the No. 2 post, has six wins, three seconds and one third 
in 10 starts during a most consistent year, and has won races at distances 
ranging from a mile to 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Zilzal, a Kentucky-bred, English-raced son of Nureyev who was bought for 
$750,000 as a yearling by Sheik Mana al Maktoum, has never lost, winning three 
races at seven furlongs and two at a mile. The 3-year-old colt's smallest 
margin of victory has been three lengths and he has won by as many as 10 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen this horse's record," Lukas said. "But this will be the first time 
he has raced around a course with left-handed turns, and he won't be used to 
the dead-flat grass surface that they have here." 
</P>
<P>
The Sprint, which hasn't been won by a favorite since Eillo took the inaugural 
running at Hollywood Park in 1984, was won last year by Lukas' Gulch, and the 
trainer with a record nine Breeders' Cup victories is shooting for another win 
in the six-furlong race with On the Line. The Sprint is so unpredictable that 
On the Line has been made the favorite even though he has finished behind 
Dispersal, Sewickley and Sam Who -- other starters Saturday -- in recent races. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who won five consecutive sprints in California in midyear, breaking the 
track record for six furlongs at Hollywood Park. On the Line avenged one defeat 
with a victory in the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del Mar, where Sam Who stumbled 
at the start and finished fourth, but in the Ancient Title Handicap at Santa 
Anita on Oct. 18, Sam Who was a four-length winner, in the same time of 1:08 
that he registered at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, the 4-1 second choice in the Sprint, drew the No. 13 post. The horse 
outside him is Safely Kept, the only filly in the field and undefeated in eight 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Because 19 horses were pre-entered in the Sprint a week ago, there was some 
question whether Sam Who would get in the race. When fields are oversubscribed, 
a point system based on high 1989 finishes determines nine of the starters, and 
a panel of racing officials picks the otherfive. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 13 is supposed to be superstitious," said Henry Moreno, Sam Who's trainer. 
"But I'm not superstitious. I'm just glad to be in the race. Good horses should 
win no matter where they start."

NASCAR IS STILL ALL IN FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR RACING: BILL FRANCE, WHO BUILT STOCK CAR CIRCUIT AND RULED WITH IRON 
FIST, HAS SEEN HIS FAMILY VENTURE REACH NEW HEIGHTS WITH HIS SON BILL JR. AT 
THE HELM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Big Bill France was a flamboyant, dynamic -- some said tyrannical -- promoter 
who founded NASCAR, the world's foremost stock car racing organization, in 1947 
and ran it as a family business for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Stock car racing grew out of the ruts left by bootleggers running white 
lightning through the winding back roads of the Carolinas. France brought it 
out of the woods and onto speedways in Southern towns -- Darlington, S.C.; 
Charlotte, N.C.; Daytona Beach, Fla., and, later, Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars and Bars of the Confederacy were part and parcel of the sport. Grits 
were on every menu and if a driver didn't have a drawl dripping with Dixie, he 
was immediately recognized as a furriner. 
</P>
<P>
France, in essence, created a sport and held it hostage. 
</P>
<P>
When he decided it was time to step aside in 1972, he looked across the 
breakfast table and tabbed his son, Bill Jr., then 39, to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
Junior has run the show for 17 years, and his accomplishments are nearly as 
apparent as his father's. NASCAR has 30,000 members, 112 tracks, of which 84 -- 
such as Ascot Park, Saugus Speedway and Orange Show Speedway -- run weekly 
shows, and 11 different racing series. The Winston Cup, an $18-million series 
for steel-bodied, American-made sedans, is the crown jewel. 
</P>
<P>
And Bill France makes the decisions, just as always. Only now it's not Big 
Bill. It's Bill Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Their style of leadership is as different as their stature. When he was running 
things, Big Bill was 6-foot-5, outgoing and a man who made decisions at a 
moment's notice, often out on the race track. There was never the slightest 
question who was in charge. Junior is five inches shorter, quiet and given more 
to sitting around a conference table, listening to a consensus before making up 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had more to do personally because he didn't have many people around 
him," Bill Jr. said during a recent visit here. "When he started out, it was 
mostly Dad and Pat Parcell, just the two of them doing it all. Later, he had 
Bill Gazaway and Lin Kuchler, but he never had a large staff. 
</P>
<P>
"As for myself, I believe, without a doubt, that I have as strong a staff as 
there is in motorsports. I depend on them for input, but I operate on my own 
consensus. That is, when there are three of us discussing an issue, each of the 
others has a vote, but I have three." 
</P>
<P>
France's most trusted lieutenants are his younger brother, Jimmy, the executive 
vice president; Les Richter, former president of Riverside International 
Raceway, who runs the Winston Cup series; Jim Hunter, a former newspaperman who 
administrates the burgeoning organization, particularly the popular Winston 
Racing Series for weekly tracks; Jim Foster, another one-time sportswriter who 
markets the show; and Dick Beaty, the series director who sees that the rules 
are followed. 
</P>
<P>
Junior was groomed for his job, if not from birth, at least from the day Big 
Bill promoted his first NASCAR race on the sand at Daytona Beach in 1948. Young 
Bill swept out the office that day. Later, he did just about everything there 
was to do around a race track -- flagman, scorer, steward, promoter, even a 
driver for a few races and six years as vice president before moving into his 
father's chair. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few years, he was thought to be little more than a puppet for his 
father, who maintained his office in NASCAR headquarters on Bill France 
Boulevard in Daytona Beach as president and chairman of the board of 
International Speedway Corp., which owned the Daytona and Talladega tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was down the hall and he'd been through it all, so I'd be kind of stupid if 
I didn't bring him in and get his views, what with his experience and 
background," was as far as Junior would go in answering his critics. 
</P>
<P>
When Bill Sr. was asked about the arrangement several years ago, he said: "I 
don't look over his shoulder. He knows I'm available for consultation and 
sometimes he asks for it. Sometimes he doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
One time he was not consulted was when the Darlington track, stock car racing's 
original superspeedway, was put on the market. Junior closed the deal on it 
before his father was aware of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The elder France, 79, is virtually retired today, occasionally making the trip 
from his home in Ormond Beach to his old office, mostly to chat with old 
acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Petty, whose remarkable career as a driver has spanned both France 
administrations, defines their differences: 
</P>
<P>
"Senior was the kind of cat you could talk to until you was blue in the face 
and he'd do what he'd figured on doing all along. Now Junior will listen, and 
you get the idea he's considering what you're saying, but he makes up his mind 
all by himself." 
</P>
<P>
The differences between father and son are reflected in the direction stock car 
racing has taken during their stewardships. It has grown from a rural, regional 
sport under Big Bill into a nationally accepted, cosmopolitan sport under Bill 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the transition, NASCAR was still experiencing growing pains, 
struggling against the trappings of its Down South atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made tremendous strides in the past 10 years," France Jr. said. "With 
the help of R.J. Reynolds (Tobacco Co.), which came in and showed the corporate 
world that their products didn't have to be automotive-related to become 
involved, and television, which showcased our kind of racing to the general 
public, we became accepted nationally." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years, Winston Cup racing has moved into such diverse areas 
as Watkins Glen, N.Y., Sonoma, Calif., and Phoenix, all to immediate 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been holding Indy car races at Phoenix for 35 years and we went in 
there last year after Riverside closed and had the largest crowd in the track's 
history," France said. "And last June, when PIR (Phoenix International Raceway) 
opened its advance ticket sales for the Nov. 5 race, they sold more tickets on 
that weekend than the Formula One race drew for a race that was going on at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully confident that if we went to places like Road America (in Elkhart 
Lake, Wis.) or Portland, we'd be dynamite. We have a national complexion now. 
Part of that is reflected in the hometowns of our drivers. They're not all from 
the South, like they were for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, for instance, seven out of 10 drivers came from the Carolinas, and the 
rest from other Southern states. Now look at where they come from: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chemung, N.Y. Geoff Bodine will drive next season for the quintessential 
good ol' boy, Junior Johnson, of Ingle Hollow, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greenfield, Wis. Alan Kulwicki is the defending champion in Sunday's 
Autoworks 500 at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Batesville, Ark. Mark Martin was the winner two weeks ago at Rockingham, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ontario, Calif. Joe Ruttman is a former United States Auto Club champion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fitchburg, Mass. Ken Bouchard was 1988 Winston Cup rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fenton, Mo. Ken Schrader and Rusty Wallace, the Winston Cup points leader, 
both are from Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
The younger France was fortunate in arriving at the presidency of NASCAR about 
the same time that Ralph Seagraves of R.J. Reynolds brought the Winston program 
into stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an ideal relationship," France said. "They are involved in promoting 
stock car racing and raising the financial rewards, but they do not try to tell 
us how to run the sport. Maybe the most important thing they've done is showing 
the rest of the consumer market that motor racing was a good vehicle for 
promoting their products. Before RJR, everything was automotive-related." 
</P>
<P>
Major sponsors for top teams now come from all facets of the business world. 
For instance, there are beers, coffee, headache powder, soft drinks, cooking 
oil, soaps, film, food, and even products and services targeted for the women's 
market, figure salons and panty hose. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR, and France personally, have been criticized, especially by the Southern 
press, for what was perceived to be Winston overkill. 
</P>
<P>
First, it was when the name of NASCAR's premier series was changed from Grand 
National to Winston Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to do that myself," France said. "I felt that with the kind of 
money they were spending, they deserved to have the series named after them. It 
was not their idea at all, and I had to pressure to make the change." 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds, which started out in 1971 with a $100,000 bonus fund in the name 
of Winston, will distribute $2.5 million in driver point-fund money this year. 
Of that, $1 million will go to the champion. 
</P>
<P>
"One important thing about the point fund is that it forces all the top drivers 
to drive in all the races if they want to take part in the big bonuses at the 
end of the season," France said. "There was a time when only half a dozen 
drivers ran the full schedule, and a lot of the name drivers picked and chose 
their spots. This way, every track is guaranteed the top drivers, and the 
battle for the points championship stimulates interest all season long." 
</P>
<P>
This year, with only two races remaining, Sunday's at Phoenix and the closer 
Nov. 19 at Atlanta, three drivers remain in close contention for the $1-million 
prize -- Wallace, Martin and Dale Earnhardt, the defending champion from 
Mooresville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The series name change was made in 1986, but it met with such resistance in the 
South that Robert Griggs, publisher of Grand National Scene, did not change the 
name to Winston Cup Scene until this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Change doesn't come easy back home," France said. "When we decided to run at 
Sears Point for the summer race that Riverside used to have, the Southeastern 
press jumped all over me about what a bad show it was going to be on the road 
course there. 
</P>
<P>
"That was before the race. After it was over, and they'd seen a great show, it 
was amazing how quickly I went from a chump on Thursday to a smart guy on 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Second, was when the Winston, an $800,000 race for winners only from the 
previous season, was announced. The winner receives $200,000, but the race does 
not count in season standings. 
</P>
<P>
"The Winston is like baseball's All-Star game or professional football's Pro 
Bowl," France said. "It's a special event. Most all sports have something 
similar. Charlotte (Motor Speedway) has done an excellent job of running it. 
And the drivers like it." 
</P>
<P>
What would happen if RJR pulled its Winston brand out of racing, or if tobacco 
sponsorships were legislated against, as they are in England and some provinces 
in Australia? 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could replace them," France said. "At least I would hope we could. 
I certainly hope we never have to." 
</P>
<P>
As a hedge against that happening, NASCAR has retained the Grand National name. 
It is now the name of their No. 2 series, for late model sportsman cars. 
</P>
<P>
The manner in which the two Frances have handled ticklish situations has been 
determined as much by social change as their difference in style. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when the drivers threatened to organize a union, Big Bill 
suspended the ringleaders, Curtis Turner and Tim Flock, from NASCAR for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
France's word became law the day in 1949 when Glenn Dunaway's car owner sued 
NASCAR after France disqualified the winning car for having an illegal chassis. 
The claim was that NASCAR had no right to make such a decision after the race 
was run. France won the case and no one challenged him after that. 
</P>
<P>
Even major factories felt his wrath. Whenever France determined that one 
manufacturer was getting an advantage, he changed the rules. In 1965, Chrysler 
pulled out of NASCAR when France virtually outlawed the 426-cubic inch Hemi 
engine in an attempt to make Ford and General Motors cars more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling kept Richard Petty, the sport's most popular figure, on the 
sidelines for most of the year. Petty turned to drag racing to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1969, France opened Alabama International Raceway in 
Talladega, which was longer, steeper and faster than any superspeedway ever 
built. When the leading drivers tested it, they claimed it was too dangerous, 
that the searing speeds would shred tires and cause accidents. A loose-knit 
organization called the Professional Drivers Assn., headed by Petty, petitioned 
France to postpone the race. 
</P>
<P>
France refused, claiming that too many tickets had already been sold. When the 
drivers continued to balk, France himself, then 59 but an old-time beach racer, 
climbed into a race car and lapped the high-banked track at 176 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The leading drivers were amazed, but refused to budge from their stand. France 
reacted in his usual dictatorial manner. He rounded up a bunch of stock car 
drivers from lesser series, put up a big purse and, to further incense the 
regular drivers, invited spectators in free. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brickhouse won the race and was never heard from again. The regular 
drivers were back in their cars the next time NASCAR went to Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bill not only proved his point, he broke the potential power of the PDA. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior could never get away with that kind of action today," said Ned Jarrett, 
a former Grand National champion driver who is now a TV commentator. "We're in 
a litigious world and a suspension like he gave Turner would bring lawsuits 
today from every angle. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Tim Richmond case occurred 20 years ago, France would have barred him 
by edict and that would have been the end of it. But Junior had to move 
cautiously and make sure he was on safe grounds." 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond case, with its allegations of drug use, might have been the 
touchiest situation in young France's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors circulated for several years that Richmond was using drugs. The 
situation came to a head at Watkins Glen in 1987, when a number of drivers 
protested Richmond's behavior on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR responded by announcing a drug policy for 1988, under which drivers, or 
any other members of the organization, could be tested "based on reasonable 
suspicion." Richmond was the first, and so far, only person tested. 
</P>
<P>
When Richmond was suspended shortly before the Daytona 500, after it was 
announced that he tested positive, he demanded a second test, claiming he used 
only over-the-counter medicine. The second test proved him right, but he still 
refused to turn over his medical files to NASCAR, in accordance with their 
rules, and filed a $20-million suit for defamation of character, which was 
later settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Said France: "I don't want to go into the details of the Richmond case because 
he's gone (Richmond died last August in West Palm Beach, Fla., of AIDS), but 
our approach was, and still is, that if we have somebody who uses drugs, we 
don't want him on the race track. Our idea is not to ban that person for life, 
but only to keep him off the track until he gets clean. We are not trying to be 
punitive. Our concern is for the safety of others, the same as it would be in 
the case of airplane pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"Driver reaction to the drug policy has been good. We do not plan to have 
random testing. We believe in the reasonable-suspicion approach. We sent Dick 
Beaty to drug school to learn how to recognize a potential problem, especially 
in the garage area. So far, there have been no rumbles at all. We don't think 
we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Looking five years down the road, France foresees teams and drivers running for 
more prize money, continual strong support from sponsors, both old and new, and 
more growth from television. 
</P>
<P>
He does not, however, see any radical changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is one of controlled growth," he said. "We do not want to grow 
so big that we can't keep our arms wrapped around what we have, if you know 
what I mean. We don't want to grow so fast that we get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Two possible areas of growth are the adoption of Japanese cars for Winston Cup 
racing and the expansion of the series into new markets -- or in the case of 
Southern California, a return to an old market. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign cars have been forbidden in the past because rules call for 
steel-bodied cars built in the United States. However, Nissans are now built in 
Tennessee, Toyotas in Kentucky, Hondas in Ohio, Mazdas in Michigan and 
Mitsubishis in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be interesting if one of the Japanese cars qualified," France 
said. "Personally, I would welcome them, but first they would have to meet our 
size and engine regulations. We run only rocker-arm type engines, so would not 
allow the double overhead cams. And all ours are normally aspirated, so there 
could be no turbocharging. 
</P>
<P>
"And they would have to conform to the size and silhouette of the cars we are 
running. There are no Chryslers running now because their cars are too small. 
If we let them in, all the Ford and General Motors people would demand that 
they run their smaller cars, too, and we don't want to be a series for compact 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of passenger cars has been coming down, and we have come down with 
them, but our desire since 1974 has been to run what the manufacturers call 
their intermediate car. And we want fenders to cover the wheels. That's a must 
to keep them stock-appearing." 
</P>
<P>
This year's Winston Cup series included 29 races, starting in February with the 
Daytona 500 and ending Nov. 19 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"We could expand to one or two more if we found the right places," France said. 
"That would be about the limit because we have to be concerned with the race 
team expenses. I sure would like to see one again in Southern California. We 
miss Riverside very much." 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR had as many as 60 Grand National races in 1964, but France sees no 
return to such an ambitious schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those races were on short tracks in the Southeast and didn't demand 
all the travel we have today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased costs is the biggest problem facing racing, just like it is 
everywhere in society. 
</P>
<P>
"Costs are going up for everything, but the biggest jump is in personnel, 
particularly for drivers and engine men. There's not much NASCAR can do about 
that. We can't tell owners what to pay their race drivers. Nor should we. That 
takes care of itself in supply and demand economics. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can call it a fault, we probably have more good teams than we need. 
I'll explain what I mean. For all 40 teams in the Daytona 500 to come to the 
final turn of the final lap within a second of each other, someone would win 
and someone would finish 40th. For that kind of a finish, it would cost the 
same amount to run 40th as it cost the guy who won. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that most of the 40 owners would bust their butts to get an edge 
for the next race, meaning spending more money. But if some of the teams had 
lower expectations, with lesser budgets, they'd still finish 40th or better. In 
other words, it should be possible to have a good racing team on a low budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Drivers like James Hylton, Elmo Langley, Cecil Gordon and Buddy Arrington did 
it for years. Today, more and more affluent owners want winning teams, have 
money or sponsorship, and run up the cost. It's the same in any business, but I 
hate to hear teams continually complaining about not being able to meet the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could guarantee that the worst you could do was break even, we'd have a 
thousand cars lined up. I'd even own one myself. But that's not the way the 
world works." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Stock car racing hit the sports scene shortly after World War II was over and 
it hit hardest in the Deep South, where Bill France took it off the hard-packed 
sand of Daytona Beach and the backwoods of the Carolinas and put it on race 
tracks. His son, Bill Jr., now presides over NASCAR, stock car's sanctioning 
body, which has long since become a major league operation.

A NEW AGE FOR SPORT OF THE '80S; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AFTER A DECADE OF REMARKABLE GROWTH, HERE'S WHAT TO EXPECT AS 
AMERICA'S WINTER GAME TURNS THE CORNER INTO THE 1990S. 
</P>

<P>
As a new decade beckons, sentimentalists abound. Even those forward-thinking 
corporate types in the National Basketball Assn. might be tempted to look back 
wistfully at the 1980s and recall with pride just how far the league has come. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the NBA was more destructive than productive, if anyone noticed 
or cared. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal condition of its teams suggested consolidation, not expansion. Drug 
use was so rampant that a "high-five" could have been the starting lineup of 
any number of teams, not a congratulatory handshake. The only marketable gate 
attractions were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving, although rookies named 
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird had just arrived. Television ratings, as a result, 
ebbed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the cusp of the '90s, the league has never been more popular. 
</P>
<P>
Financial stability has been achieved through a self-imposed salary cap. 
Profits have soared from both network and cable television. The NBA is the only 
professional league to add expansion teams, four in two years, during the 
decade. While drug use still is a problem, it has been greatly reduced through 
the enforcement of a strict drug policy that mandates the suspension and even 
banishment of players for substance abuse. And there are stars aplenty, 
including Johnson, Bird, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Isiah Thomas, etc. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has given the NBA a reputation as the most progressive of 
professional sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the '80s, the NBA had only two black head coaches and one black 
in upper management. Now, there are five black head coaches and five blacks in 
management. And a group headed by two black businessmen recently purchased the 
Denver Nuggets, the first minority-operated ownership in major pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
The league also has gone global. In what might be called a foreign exchange 
program, five of Eastern Europe's best players will be in the NBA this season, 
while two first-round picks -- Danny Ferry and Anthony Cook -- and one 
first-round pick from 1988 -- Brian Shaw -- are playing in Italy and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Although many believe that the NBA has reached a saturation point in terms of 
popularity and growth, this season figures to be as unpredictable and 
entertaining as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams -- the Lakers, the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers -- 
dominated the '80s, but the '90s will begin with a new champion, the Detroit 
Pistons, and several teams that could possibly win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is an informal preview of the NBA's new season, at the start of a 
new decade: 
</P>
<P>
Best reasons why the Pistons will repeat as champions -- They still have 
arguably the league's best backcourt trio in Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and 
Vinnie Johnson; the best bench in John Salley, Dennis Rodman and Johnson, and 
the best team airplane in Roundball One. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of talented people," Thomas said. "We have more talent than 
we've ever had before." 
</P>
<P>
Best reasons why the Pistons will not repeat -- They have lost Rick Mahorn and 
some of their "bad boy" image, as well. There is a chance that journeyman Scott 
Hastings will start at power forward. Either that, or Salley will start, but 
that weakens the bench. Only one champion in 20 years has repeated, and 
besides, Mark Aguirre's influence will be felt for a full season now. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen teams Laker Coach Pat Riley truly believes can win the NBA title -- In 
no particular order, they are the Lakers, Detroit, Boston, New York, Cleveland, 
Chicago, Phoenix, Golden State, Portland, Utah, Dallas, San Antonio, Houston 
and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if things break well for them, any of those teams can win it," Riley 
said. "You have to respect all those teams." 
</P>
<P>
Reason to take the Celtics seriously -- Bird is back and has this to say about 
his healing ankles: "I think I've got new ankles. They feel like new ankles. I 
feel like I'm learning basketball all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Reasons not to take the Celtics seriously -- Age. Bird will be 33 in December 
and is coming off major surgery. Robert Parish is 36, Dennis Johnson 35 and 
Kevin McHale will be 32 in December. Also, they have replaced Shaw with John 
Bagley, who will start at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Biggest assist of the season, so far -- To Robert Wussler, chief executive 
officer of Comsat Video Enterprises. Just when it appeared that Bertram Lee and 
Peter Bynoe, the black businessmen trying to buy the Nuggets, would fail to 
gather investors, Wussler's corporation became the majority stockholder, though 
Lee and Bynoe will be managing general partners. 
</P>
<P>
Most exclusive hotel-room service since the minibar and mints on pillows -- 
Wussler wants to make Nugget games available on hotel pay-per-view systems that 
provide first-run and soft-porn movies for guests. Comsat currently is in 
300,000 hotel rooms nationwide, and Wussler is hoping that by midseason, 
travelers will be able to pay $5.95 and watch that exciting Denver-Indiana 
Pacers game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a strong believer in pay-per-view," Wussler said. "The opportunity to put 
the Denver Nuggets' games and other NBA games into these hotel rooms is 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Team you would least like to see on pay-per-view -- The New Jersey Nets. They 
aren't an expansion team, so they don't have that excuse. They have two big 
men, Sam Bowie and Joe Barry Carroll, who could break down or lose interest at 
any moment. And new Coach Bill Fitch already is losing what little patience he 
has. 
</P>
<P>
Team most likely to go from 21-61 to 61-21 -- The San Antonio Spurs? Nah, they 
won't make that big a turnaround, but 50 victories and a Midwest Division title 
are possible. They have David Robinson in the middle, Terry Cummings' scoring 
at forward, Sean Elliott's scoring at guard and point guard Maurice Cheeks' 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Coach with the best chance of being fired first -- Larry Brown at San Antonio. 
If the Spurs falter, look for Brown to go quickly. There was talk he would be 
fired after run-ins with several players last season, but instead the feuding 
players were traded. 
</P>
<P>
Coach with the second-best chance -- Mike Fratello of the Atlanta Hawks. Moses 
Malone has already spoken out against him. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's list of Western Conference darkhorses -- San Antonio and the Portland 
Trail Blazers. "I think Maurice Cheeks is the key to San Antonio's whole deal 
this year," he said. "Portland made some great moves. They got Buck (Williams, 
an All-Star power forward from New Jersey), (center) Wayne Cooper, (swingman) 
Robert Reid and (draft pick) Cliff Robinson. We've got to watch out for them." 
</P>
<P>
Happiest player in the league -- It has to be Buck Williams. "I'm happy to be 
out (of New Jersey)," he said. "People said (the Nets) couldn't win with (me). 
That's ridiculous. They made a lot of bad decisions. I should've spoken out a 
lot more on the players they brought in. I was too diplomatic." 
</P>
<P>
The official language of the Golden State Warriors will be -- (a) German, for 
Uwe Blab; (b) Lithuanian, for Sarunas Marciulionis; (c) Sudanese, for Manute 
Bol; (d) Brooklynese, for Chris Mullin; (e) Cliche, for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac's scouting report on the other chips off the Eastern Bloc in the 
NBA this season -- On Zarko Paspalj of San Antonio: "Best player in Europe last 
year. Good shooter. Left-handed. Very quick, very strong. Smokes too much 
cigarettes." On Drazen Petrovic of Portland: "Very good shot. Technically, a 
complete player." On Marciulionis: "Good type of player for the NBA. I think 
he'll play very good this season." On Alexander Volkov of Atlanta: "Quick and 
strong but not a good shot. That will (hurt) him." 
</P>
<P>
European happiest to be in America -- Paspalj, who told a San Antonio reporter: 
"I love Pizza Hut. I want to open a Pizza Hut in Yugoslavia. I want to see 
Eddie Murphy and Whitney Houston and Jack Nicholson. I want to buy a 
Mitsubishi. I love Marlboro cigarettes. I want to play in the NBA. I come to 
America with hope." 
</P>
<P>
Call him anything but Al -- Volkov wants to go by Sasha, apparently a popular 
nickname in the Soviet Union. He said he does not mind Alexander, but when he 
was introduced before an exhibition game as Al Volkov, he bristled. 
</P>
<P>
Don't call him a guard -- Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins, always the team player, 
has agreed to move from forward to off-guard because of injuries. But he still 
wants to be announced as a forward. His reason? 
</P>
<P>
"If they put me down as a guard, no way I make first team All-Star," Wilkins 
said. "No way I can beat out Michael Jordan. But I've got to believe I'm one of 
the two best forwards, so I know I can make it if they call me a forward." 
</P>
<P>
Boldest prediction since Riley's guarantee of repeat championships -- 
Washington forward Bernard King guarantees fans that the Bullets will make the 
playoffs. Will season-ticket refunds come out of King's paycheck if they don't? 
</P>
<P>
Best rule change -- It concerns the 24-second shot clock. On inbounds plays 
with fewer than five seconds remaining, the 24-second clock will no longer be 
automatically reset to five seconds. If one second remains, a team will have 
one second to inbound the ball and shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Most confusing rule change -- There will be stricter enforcement of the illegal 
defense rules, whatever they are. Teams now must double-team aggressively in 
half-court defenses, rather than playing off the ball and basically guarding an 
area. The rules now state that trapping defenders must be close enough to get a 
held-ball call. 
</P>
<P>
Got that? 
</P>
<P>
Most confusing rule change to players and coaches -- Scoreboards will show 
10ths of a second during the last minute of each quarter. It already has 
befuddled a few players and coaches. In an exhibition game, Miami Heat Coach 
Ron Rothstein yelled to his players that eight seconds remained. Actually, only 
.8 of a second remained. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dallas Maverick rookie Randy White of the new clock: "You look up there 
and the 10ths are running and it confuses you. You look at the 10ths, not the 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Team with the most serious problem at center -- No, it's not the Lakers' task 
of replacing Abdul-Jabbar. The Seattle SuperSonics will use 6-foot-9 Michael 
Cage, making him the smallest starting center in the league. "I'm just trying 
to make teams pay the price for putting a big man on me," Cage said. 
</P>
<P>
Most appropriate nickname coined this season -- It goes to Bob (Hard Line) 
Stein, president of the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves. Stein reportedly 
promised big men Rick Mahorn, Steve Johnson and Tyrone Corbin that he would 
rework their contracts before the start of training camp. Then he amended that 
to after the players had "proven themselves." All three players have been 
holdouts, Mahorn finally being traded to Philadelphia for draft picks last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 1 why expansion should be stopped -- Tony Campbell, former Laker 
sub, figures to be the Timberwolves' leading scorer. And the Orlando Magic 
won't be much more competitive than the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 2 -- Miami and the Charlotte Hornets, last season's newcomers, don't 
look much better than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Reason why the Cleveland Cavaliers might look like the Cadavers of old early in 
the season -- Center Brad Daugherty has been slow to recover from foot surgery, 
and forward Larry Nance also had left ankle surgery and probably won't play 
until December. Other than that, the Cavaliers are in fine shape. 
</P>
<P>
Most popular contract stipulation -- Weight clauses. Among the hefty players 
who have such weighty provisions are the Clippers' Benoit Benjamin, the 
Bullets' Mel Turpin, the 76ers' Barkley and Jay Vincent, and the Mavericks' Sam 
Perkins. Aguirre should have one. 
</P>
<P>
Biggest reason why the Houston Rockets might not win the Midwest Division -- 
Center Akeem Olajuwon has been diagnosed as having thrombophlebitis, for which 
he was hospitalized eight days in July. Until recently, Olajuwon had been 
taking blood thinners to prevent clotting in his left calf, and doctors are 
worried that a blow to the calf will cause hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
Most probable successors to Bill Walton as the league's most frequently injured 
player -- A tie between Ralph Sampson of the Sacramento Kings, and Kiki 
Vandeweghe of the New York Knicks. Sampson's knees, of course, still flare up 
every other game, and he recently strained his left hamstring lifting weights. 
Vandeweghe's back problems have traveled from Portland to New York, and he 
recently was sent to a specialist in California who diagnosed his condition as 
an "arthritic process." 
</P>
<P>
Quickest recovery by a player -- James Donaldson, who ruptured the patellar 
tendon in his right leg and underwent major surgery last spring, will start at 
center for the Mavericks in their season opener Friday night against the Lakers 
at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Player most likely to inspire opponents -- Jon Koncak, who signed a six-season, 
$13.2-million contract with Atlanta, already has drawn both scorn and 
thank-yous from other players. Scorn has come from the Utah Jazz's Karl Malone, 
who earns $1 million less than Koncak and who thoroughly outplayed the Hawk 
forward in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Malone: "Every night, he's going to run into it. A lot of guys will say, 
'Look at all his money. Look at what this guy's making.' Then, they'll go out 
and try to kick his (rear)." 
</P>
<P>
Team most likely to suffer from an identity crisis -- Under new Coach Stu 
Jackson, the Knicks no longer will emphasize three-point shooting and their 
half-court defensive trap. Jackson said the Knicks' offense will revolve around 
center Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
Player who believes most in winning through intimidation -- It is Barkley, who 
believes that the 76ers can win the Atlantic Division with 55 victories, nine 
more than last season. "Johnny Dawkins, Hersey Hawkins and Kenny Payne can help 
us win nine more games," Barkley said. "If they don't, I'll kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Next stop for nomadic Benoit Benjamin should life with the Clippers prove 
unbearable -- How about the Canary Islands? A team there has an opening after 
the 76ers signed journeyman center Kurt Nimphius, who had played in the 
Canaries last season. 
</P>
<P>
Number of times Riley will tell his Laker players that the upcoming game will 
be the most important of the season -- 82.

SHELL THROWS SCHROEDER TO BENGALS, FANS; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: AFTER GETTING BOOED IN RELIEF OF INJURED BEUERLEIN LAST WEEK, 
QUARTERBACK RETURNS TO STARTING LINEUP SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
You've got your health and your wealth, $1 million a year worth. 
</P>
<P>
You run out onto the Coliseum field Sunday -- what? 
</P>
<P>
You say you're not playing any more? You're too smart for that? You know what's 
going to happen: Schroeder's friends and neighbors are going to boo him from 
here to Twentynine Palms and it's not worth it? 
</P>
<P>
You must not be Jay Schroeder, after all. The real Jay Schroeder is showing up 
as advertised and says he's looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell bowed to the obvious Wednesday, taking Steve Beuerlein 
and his wounded knee off day-to-day status and announcing Schroeder as Sunday's 
starter against the Cincinnati Bengals. Thus he entrusts his team's new era of 
good feeling, and perhaps its playoff chances, to a quarterback who has 
completed 28% of his passes in his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder warmed up last Sunday, relieving Beuerlein and getting booed from the 
moment he pulled off his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
Did it have a salutary effect? 
</P>
<P>
On his first pass attempt, a short pattern, he double-clutched, threw late and 
bounced the ball at a receiver's feet. He went one for eight. 
</P>
<P>
What, him worry? 
</P>
<P>
"Fans are going to do what fans do everywhere in the world," Schroeder said 
cheerfully. "I do the same thing when I watch basketball and baseball, so . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to do when you're a player is block that out and go from there. 
It takes some doing, but once you get in the game mentally and physically, 
nothing else really matters." 
</P>
<P>
He's no rookie at it, either. In 1986, his first season as a starter with the 
Washington Redskins, he completed a mere 51% but rallied the team to victory in 
nine fourth quarters and took them to the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
In game after game, he was booed by the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium fans who know 
something about booing . . . and cheered . . . and booed and cheered. Mr. Hyde 
played quarterback the first three quarters, but the fourth quarter belonged to 
Dr. Jekyll. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, he fell to 48% and lost his job -- forever, it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Moral: There were times when he was able to fight his way back, and times when 
he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
That brings us to this week, with Beuerlein having suggested point- edly that 
the problem with the offense wasn't its scheme but its quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to Schroeder? After three games this season, he was at 57% 
and 18 yards a completion. 
</P>
<P>
After Art Shell replaced Mike Shanahan, amid promises that the old ways and the 
long ball were coming back, Schroeder, the Daryle Lamonica prototype and bomber 
extraordinaire with the arm to match anyone's, tried to go down the field. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he went south. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably tried to make the big play too often," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to drop back and throw the ball down the field a lot. In the first 
couple of weeks, we weren't doing that. We were taking it when it came. We have 
to get back to doing that. When the long ball is there, you take your shot. 
When it's not, you dump the ball underneath." 
</P>
<P>
Could there have been another factor? The Raider organization had several key 
Beuerlein proponents, who liked what they saw last season when he was an 
overmatched first-year starter, and liked even more Beuerlein's terrific 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's biggest booster was Shanahan. When Shanahan was fired, Schroeder 
may have sensed that his margin for error was dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
When Schroeder was relieved with the team leading the Kansas City Chiefs, the 
future was clear. 
</P>
<P>
When Beuerlein exploded against the Redskins, the future was clearer. Until 
further notice, it's Beuerlein's. 
</P>
<P>
And Schroeder's future? 
</P>
<P>
He may not have Beuerlein's infectious enthusiasm, but he clearly has the 
requisite ability. He is tough and looks like he truly believes in himself. His 
post-benching conduct, compared to his experience in Washington, where he 
withdrew angrily, shows that he is capable of learning from his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about (the No. 1 job)," Schroeder said. "I have to play well. 
I'm going to let my talents dictate what I do. If I do the things I'm capable 
of doing, I can match anybody in the league. There's no problem about that. If 
I'm able to play the game I think I can, there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders signed quarterback Vince Evans, another indication that they're 
prepared for Steve Beuerlein to miss more than this week. Evans, 34, has been 
selling Mercedes-Benzes in the South Bay and staying in shape by playing catch 
with a former UCLA walk-on named Sanjay Lal. "He had gotten released from 
UCLA," Evans said wryly, "so immediately we had something in common." Evans was 
waived in camp, and this is his third Raider stint. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Eddie Anderson has a hamstring pull, is limping noticeably and is listed 
as questionable for Sunday's game. Vann McElroy is out, and the next free 
safety would probably be Mike Harden or Russell Carter. . . . Return man Bobby 
Joe Edmonds has an ankle injury and was placed on injured reserve to make room 
for Evans.

ANGELS ASK WAIVERS ON GLENN HOFFMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels asked waivers on infielder Glenn Hoffman Wednesday for the purpose 
of giving him his release. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, 31, joined the Angels as a free agent last January. During the 1989 
season, he appeared in 48 games and had 22 hits in 104 at-bats for a .212 
average. He had one home run and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman appeared at all four infield positions and made his first career starts 
as a first baseman and as a designated hitter.

The Seattle Seahawks say they think Brian Bosworth will be out for the season 
because of an ailing right shoulder that has caused him to miss the last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But Bosworth won't require another shoulder operation. He underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder last season, causing him to miss 
seven games.

INNOVATION: SEARCHING FOR NATIONAL POLICY ON SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere, stumbling aimlessly between Pennsylvania and Constitution avenues in 
Washington, is $18 billion-plus in search of a policy. 
</P>
<P>
That's roughly what the federal government plans to spend on 
non-defense-related science and technology this fiscal year. Only in our 
nation's capital, where a dash of politics sweetens unpalatable taxes into 
tasty revenue enhancers, can a phrase such as "science policy" be an oxymoron. 
That's not healthy and it's not smart. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that, after an initial delay, the Bush Administration seems to 
have made all the right moves in setting up a policy infrastructure. The 
appointment of Yale physicist D. Allan Bromley as White House science adviser 
was well received -- as was the upgrading of the post to Cabinet-level status. 
Bush even reconstituted an Office of Science and Technology Policy to further 
assure that intelligent policy advice and technical expertise wouldn't be total 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have hoped for much more," says William Golden, president of the 
New York Academy of Sciences and a longtime player in science policy circles. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the speech writer who penned candidate Bush's campaign commitments to 
emphasize science and innovation is now deputy to Office of Management and 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman, overseeing the science and technology 
budget. At 32, Robert Grady is one of the younger Turks shaping the dollar flow 
to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science 
Foundation and the nation's universities, as well as brokering some of the 
budget trade-offs between Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Investments in science and technology are a priority," says Grady, who is less 
than thrilled with the way that Congress has trimmed Bush's initiatives. The 
Administration's rationale is crisp and well defined: A dollar spent on science 
and technology is an investment; a dollar spent on "entitlements" is a dollar 
destined for consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Darman has publicly decried what he describes as America's "I want my Maypo . . 
. NOW!" culture, and it is clear that boosting the science budget sends a clear 
signal that this Administration wants to bias the budget toward investment and 
away from consumption. Investing in science and technology becomes a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the trick is matching the symbolism with substance. Spending money is easy. 
Making intelligent investments for the long term is not. Despite having sharp 
people in the right places, the Bush Administration has yet to articulate a 
real policy to deal with the difficult trade-offs involved in funding this 
area: 
</P>
<P>
* Are the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health 
structured the best way for funding research? 
</P>
<P>
* Should the government fund more "Little Science" efforts as opposed to "Big 
Science" projects, such as the superconducting supercollider? 
</P>
<P>
* What should be the balance between basic and applied research? 
</P>
<P>
* Should the government spend more on science equipment or science education? 
</P>
<P>
* How much science should be funded with an eye toward global competitiveness? 
</P>
<P>
These are precisely the questions that aren't being answered -- and yet, these 
are precisely the questions that are getting lost amid the budget battles. They 
are also the questions that will determine what kind of return America's 
taxpayers get for their multibillion-dollar investments. 
</P>
<P>
Grady freely acknowledges that "there will be a very healthy debate -- maybe 
even a tension -- about 'investment in emerging technology' versus 'industrial 
policy.' " When does one blur into the other? The answer is politically charged 
because Republican free traders/free marketers loathe "industrial policy" with 
a passion. They don't want Washington to be "picking winners." Instead they 
want to rely on, as Ronald Reagan put it, "the magic of the marketplace" to 
determine what emerging technologies are best. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Grady says Darman is interested in "competitiveness inducing 
investments" in science and technology. "We're prepared to push that envelope a 
little further than our predecessors," Grady says. 
</P>
<P>
What about the high-definition television technology consortium that Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher pushed to get U.S. industry back into consumer 
electronics? Or other consortia to encourage state-of-the-art science and 
technology? What is the policy guiding the budgeteers? "We'll decide that on a 
case-by-case basis," Grady says. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely the point: Case by case means that there is no policy. What 
you find instead are themes impersonating initiatives. The Bush Administration 
has expressed intense interest in promoting space exploration. The 
Administration is also intrigued by establishing a supercomputer network to 
link up universities and industry. And for good old-fashioned scientific pork 
barreling, there's the superconducting supercollider -- a high-energy 
physicist's dream that will be located in (surprise!) Texas, a state that has 
more electoral votes than quality physicists. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that these efforts lack merit, it's that they lack focus, coherence 
and context. What is so troubling about the Bush Administration's approach to 
science and technology policy is that there seems to be no center. The people 
that Bush has are, I think and hear, top notch. Unfortunately, you can't tell 
this by what's happened so far. 
</P>
<P>
National Science Foundation Director Erich Bloch, who has seen his agency's 
proposed budget double under the new Administration, argues that the 
Administration's emphasis on education is a cornerstone of its science policy 
and that its commitment to science is a necessary precursor to whatever new 
policies emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Bromley, Darman, Grady and Bloch will perform a great public service if, 
instead of simply discussing initiatives, they sit down with leaders in 
industry and science to explain what they think science policy means -- and 
should mean -- in an era of deficits. They should talk tough about which 
priorities of theirs are partisan and which priorities are motivated to keep 
this country the global leader in basic science. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, they have to have the guts to be bipartisan. An Administration 
that gets America's science and business establishments to explore ways to get 
more bang for the science buck -- instead of just more bucks -- will have made 
a contribution to this country that leaves science in better condition than it 
found it.

THRIFTS: HOUSE BANKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAY PROSPECTS ARE POOR FOR GETTING UP 
TO $100 BILLION MORE TO CLEAN UP THE INDUSTRY'S MESS.

<P>
Members of Congress who helped write the savings and loan rescue legislation 
expressed surprise and anger Wednesday over estimates that the cleanup 
operation will need an additional $50 billion to $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some vowed that such massive additional borrowings would need congressional 
approval first -- a position that clashes with regulators, who contend that 
legislation already gives them authority for additional borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want to give them (regulators) a blank check," said Rep. 
Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of a House Banking Committee task force that is 
overseeing the bailout. "It's highly questionable whether they can do it on 
their own. There would be an overwhelming negative reaction in Congress if they 
try to do anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L rescue law, enacted in August, made $50 billion available to the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency that is managing the bailout. And it 
authorized the RTC to borrow additional funds as necessary to pay off the 
crippled institutions' federally insured depositors -- provided that the RTC 
could count on recapturing at least 85% of those loans by selling the S&amp;Ls' 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate preceding the law's enactment, the Bush Administration did 
not estimate how much additional borrowing might be necessary, and members of 
Congress did not ask. RTC Chairman L. William Seidman said Tuesday that the RTC 
had identified an additional 223 troubled S&amp;Ls and that it might need to 
borrow another $50 billion to $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) called that 
sum "far higher than previously mentioned or contemplated. It's a huge amount 
to draw from the limited national savings pool." 
</P>
<P>
Several other key members of Congress said that despite the RTC's borrowing 
authority, Congress will insist on approving additional loans on the scale 
contemplated by Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Banking Committee have been burned too badly already," said 
Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.), a House Banking Committee member. "They're going to 
undertake close and severe oversight of what happened and why. We don't even 
know how bad the problem is, and we want to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), said: "What you're seeing is 
an acknowledgment on the government side that the depth of the hole is much 
greater than predicted even six months ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration deserves "enormous credit" because "they stepped up to 
the plate and said the government has to be accountable," Leach said. "Sadly, 
they underestimated by half and perhaps three-fourths the depth of the problem. 
Now they're in a tortuous position of trying to figure out a way around the 
dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
Leach predicted a furious political battle over the RTC's demand for more 
funds, with Democrats trying to blame the Bush Administration for mishandling 
the S&amp;L crisis. Republicans, he said, will respond by saying the crisis was 
caused by a Democratic Congress that lifted regulatory restraints on S&amp;Ls 
in the early 1980s, and by Democratic legislatures in Texas and California that 
permitted local S&amp;Ls to make risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Watergate in the making, symbolized in the Lincoln affair," Leach 
said, referring to the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, which 
may ultimately cost the taxpayers more than $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman told a congressional hearing Tuesday that officials have not decided on 
the best way to borrow the additional billions of dollars in working capital. 
But it became apparent Wednesday that Congress will not accept substantial 
borrowing any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard from a single member of the banking committee who would let 
Seidman go out on his own to do this," said Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), 
chairman of the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman and other officials at the RTC "need to get their act together before 
getting another $50 billion," said Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger). "They 
need to clean up the mess, not contribute to the confusion. They already have a 
blank check for $50 billion."

HEARST CORP. HAS GAINED VIGOR BY CHANGING FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: IN THE PAST DECADE, THE FIRM HAS SHED MANY OF ITS MONEY-LOSING PAPERS 
AND BECOME A MODERN MEDIA CONGLOMERATE.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't so long ago that Hearst Corp. was seen as the stodgy old man of the 
media world. 
</P>
<P>
The company that William Randolph Hearst founded in 1887 was burdened with 
troubled newspapers in central cities and run by a management whose highest 
goal, many outsiders felt, was to cling desperately to the faded glory of its 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In this decade, the New York-based company has moved with a new vigor. And 
ironically, the closing of the Herald Examiner -- the sad step that Hearst so 
long resisted -- marks a major milestone in Hearst's transformation to a modern 
media conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company that shut down or sold newspapers in New York, 
Boston, Baltimore and other cities has now apparently disposed of its last 
money-losing paper. What remains is a $2-billion-a-year conglomerate with 13 
money-making newspapers, including the San Francisco Examiner, Houston 
Chronicle and Seattle Post-Intelligencer; a widely admired collection of 14 
consumer magazines, including Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan and Esquire; a 
chain of six television stations and seven radio stations; book publishers; 
cable programming ventures, and other media holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"Hearst had a great reluctance -- a noble reluctance -- to take this step," 
said John Morton, newspaper analyst who heads a firm of the same name in 
Washington. "But for all that, they'll come out of it looking pretty healthy." 
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s until nearly the '80s, Hearst was run by Chief Executives 
Richard E. Berlin and John R. Miller, who were financially conservative and 
strongly influenced by Hearst's heirs. They saw their task as hanging onto the 
nationwide chain of Hearst papers that in the 1930s claimed 15% of all U.S. 
newspaper circulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Hearst empire included many evening metropolitan newspapers that suffered 
as the wealthier readership left the central cities for the suburbs in the 
postwar decades. In the early '60s, the chain was in frail health, an 
experience that may have persuaded Berlin to avoid the risks of 
diversification. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst's style began to change with the ascent of a new chief executive, Frank 
E. Bennack Jr., in 1979. Bennack, a Texan who ran the San Antonio Light before 
taking Hearst's top job, apparently had a new measure of independence from the 
Hearst family. 
</P>
<P>
In Bennack's tenure, Hearst has spent what analysts have estimated at nearly $2 
billion to acquire new businesses, including magazines, television and radio 
stations, and book publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while about 15 Hearsts are employees or directors of the corporation, 
only one, Publisher William Randolph Hearst III of the Examiner, runs an 
operating unit. Since the mid-1970s, the company has been owned by a trust, 
which is overseen by a 13-member board that includes five Hearsts. 
</P>
<P>
The family's fortune has been estimated at nearly $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising Age magazine, the only source of estimates on Hearst Corp.'s 
revenue, reckoned last summer that the company was the ninth-largest U.S. media 
company, with nearly $2 billion in 1988 revenue. Of that, $689 million was from 
newspapers, with $919 million from magazines, $263 million from broadcast 
properties, $15 million from cable TV and $100 million from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bennack, the company has dealt with two other money-losing papers by 
selling the Boston Herald American to media lord Rupert Murdoch in 1982 and by 
closing down the Baltimore News-American in 1986. Hearst turned the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer into a money-maker by entering a government-blessed joint 
operating agreement with the Seattle Times that allows a merging of the 
competitors' business and production departments. 
</P>
<P>
(In 1965, during the Richard Berlin era, Hearst guaranteed that the San 
Francisco Examiner would remain profitable by entering a joint operating 
agreement with the San Francisco Chronicle.) 
</P>
<P>
While Hearst officials have insisted on keeping their financial results secret, 
they have disclosed that even before the Herald Examiner's shutdown, newspaper 
operations accounted for less than one-third of the company's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't to suggest that they necessarily plan to pare newspaper operations 
further. In March, 1987, to the surprise of some, Hearst purchased the Houston 
Chronicle in recession-weary Texas for $375 million and thus took on a battle 
with the Houston Post. The Chronicle has gained slightly in circulation over 
the past four years, rising to a current daily circulation of about 428,000. 
The newspaper is now profitable, analyst Morton believes. 
</P>
<P>
All may not be so rosy in San Francisco. There are rumblings that the heirs of 
the family controlling the Chronicle may want to pull out of its joint 
operating agreement with the Examiner that is currently slated to run until at 
least 2005. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner also continues to lose readership. The paper's daily circulation 
was averaged about 135,400 papers for the first six months of the year, down 
from 142,000 in 1985 and from 300,000 when the joint agreement was signed in 
1965. The Chronicle's daily circulation averaged about 556,000 for the first 
six months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst's magazine group continues to hold the respect of competitors. The group 
has demonstrated an ability to spin off new publications that extend the value 
of its magazine franchises. Two years ago, the group came out with Victoria 
magazine, a woman's magazine aimed at the socially conservative audience that 
reads Good Housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very strong lineup and know how to keep extending it," said Nancy 
Smith, director of media services at the Young &amp; Rubicam ad agency in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1987, Hearst bought Esquire, the much-traveled men's fashion and 
literature magazine, and breathed new life into it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the group's best-known executives are Helen Gurley Brown, editor-in-chief 
of Cosmopolitan, and John Mack Carter, who is editor-in-chief of Good 
Housekeeping and oversees Hearst's magazine development efforts.

STEINBERG SEEKS OK TO BUY MORE THAN 15% OF UAL CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A company controlled by New York corporate raider Saul P. Steinberg sought 
government permission on Wednesday to buy more than 15% of UAL Corp. shares, a 
move that could spark another round of takeover turmoil for the parent of 
United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, a veteran of takeover battles for Walt Disney Co. and Penn Central 
Corp., had no comment on why his Reliance Group Holdings wants to accumulate 
UAL shares. UAL also had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts familiar with UAL were uncertain of Steinberg's motives. Many doubted 
that Steinberg, a close friend of UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, would make a 
hostile move against the company. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Starkman, an analyst with Paine Webber in New York, speculated that 
Steinberg had joined with Wolf in a new effort to acquire UAL. Last month, Wolf 
tried to buy the company with United's pilots and top managers, but lenders 
refused to finance the historic $6.75-billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
Starkman said Steinberg and Wolf might "find a new way to get it done," and 
said an alliance between the two men "was not out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitragers, or professional stock speculators, have expected a new bidder to 
emerge for UAL. It is believed that Coniston Partners, a New York investment 
firm, owns a large block of UAL shares and may be preparing a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible buyer is Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, who is seeking 
union support for a new offer for UAL. United's machinists union has said it 
won't support Davis, who started UAL's takeover activity last August with a 
$240-a-share bid. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the situation said Steinberg doesn't own any UAL shares. 
The New York investor had owned 6.9% of UAL's stock, but sold his holdings 
after the takeover battle drove UAL's stock price as high as $294. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's shares have skidded since the Wolf group's bid fell apart. UAL stock 
closed Wednesday at $177 per share, up $1.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Word of Steinberg's interest came after the market close. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said that Steinberg might simply want to buy UAL shares as an 
investment. A takeover move from either Davis or Coniston would likely push 
UAL's stock price higher, handing Steinberg a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"He might believe the stock has room to go up and wants to invest in it," said 
Robert Decker, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that Steinberg wants to make the investment to guard UAL 
from an unwanted takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Others said it would be difficult for Steinberg, or any other investor, to buy 
UAL because its pilots would resist any transaction that doesn't give it a 
majority stake in the airline. The bid by the Wolf group would have given 
employees a 75% stake, and management 10%. "They were a hair's breadth from 
owning the airline," said one analyst who asked not to be identified. "They are 
adamant about having control." 
</P>
<P>
This analyst said Steinberg isn't likely to mount a full-blown takeover bid and 
take a minority interest. "His pattern has always been either he acquires 
control and takes the company private, or he takes a passive interest with no 
intention of buying the company." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the analyst said, Steinberg owned 16.5% of Los Angeles-based Tiger 
International until it was sold to Federal Express last December. Wolf was 
chairman of that Southland air cargo carrier before he joined United. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg is no stranger to takeover activity. In July, his Reliance Group 
Holdings agreed to pay $20.8 million to settle a "greenmail" lawsuit that arose 
from his raid on the Walt Disney Co. in 1984. The suit claimed Disney unfairly 
paid Steinberg greenmail, or an above-market price, for his Disney stock to 
persuade Steinberg not buy the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg's request for permission to buy more than 15% of UAL came in a filing 
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.

TWO REPORTS SHOW ECONOMY STILL SLUGGISH

<P>
U.S. manufacturing got a shot in the arm in September as new orders grew for 
the first time in four months, the nation's purchasing managers said Wednesday, 
but the group and other reports indicated that America's industrial sector 
remained sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Two separate Commerce Department reports from Washington on factory orders and 
construction spending provided further evidence of a slowdown in the overall 
economy, partly due to relatively high interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
A huge increase in defense orders helped boost U.S. factory orders in 
September, although without that segment factory orders actually declined, 
while construction spending remained flat during that month. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms what is essentially a weak economy," said Lawrence A. Veit, 
economist with the investment firm Brown Bros. Harriman &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its purchasing managers index, 
a widely watched economic barometer, rose to 47.6% from 46% in September and 
45.2% in August. 
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is 
in decline while a reading above 50% indicates growth, according to the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more than 
250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of responses regarding six 
separate indicators, including new orders, production, vendor deliveries, 
inventories, prices and employment. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said orders for durable and nondurable 
manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $236.7 billion. Excluding the 
jump in defense orders, orders actually declined 2.1%. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the department said construction spending was unchanged 
in September after surging by 1.5% in August. Residential, non-residential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$415.6 billion in September. 
</P>
<P>
Spending spurted in August because of a strong 5.3% increase in government 
building and a 2.9% gain in non-residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the decline in the October purchasing managers survey was a 
steep drop in the export orders growth rate. While export orders remained 
relatively brisk last month, the index fell to 55.5% from 60.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep short-term interest rates high, eventually they will affect 
exports," said Thomas F. Carpenter, economist with ASB Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and housing sectors of the economy have been hit hardest by 
high interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightened credit in an effort to 
slow inflation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the survey also indicated a sharp turnaround in new orders growth 
after a four-month decline. Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's 
Business Survey Committee, said the reversal "hints of a possible continued 
easing in the overall future rate of decline in the manufacturing economy." 
</P>
<P>
The new orders index rose to 51.4% from 45.4% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, while U.S. manufacturing is sluggish, some economists said the 
purchasing manager's survey has overstated the weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"All this says is that the manufacturing sector is weaker than the economy as a 
whole," said Giulio Martini, economist with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board also released a survey Wednesday showing that the 
nation's economic growth continued to vary from slow to moderate early this 
fall. The survey did not mention any inflationary problems. 
</P>
<P>
The report, known as the "beige book," was prepared for a mid-November meeting 
of the Fed's top economic policy-makers. It said conditions were mixed for 
manufacturing and construction, while consumer demand varied around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending is mixed, with a number of districts describing retail sales 
as steady to growing slowly," the survey summary said. "Manufacturing activity 
is also mixed, with some districts reporting weakness in orders and shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"Weakness of construction in some markets contrasts with evidence of some 
improvement elsewhere. Resource industries, including the energy sector, appear 
to be improving, as is agriculture generally," it continued. 
</P>
<P>
Recent economic indicators show sluggish economic growth following Fed moves to 
ease inflationary pressures by tightening credit.

Japanese Investing in U.S. Mortgages: Japanese investors have pumped an 
additional $701 million into the U.S. mortgage market through two new mutual 
funds that invest primarily in Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities, Federal 
National Mortgage Assn., or Fannie Mae, said in a statement. Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co. is lead manager and investment adviser of the new funds. Fannie Mae 
buys home mortgage loans from the original issuers and repackages some of them 
as mortgage-backed securities, which are sold to the public.

Homes More Affordable Statewide: Statewide housing affordability improved in 
September for the second month in a row as buyers increasingly sought homes in 
more affordable communities, the California Assn. of Realtors said. Eighteen 
percent of households earned the income needed to qualify for a mortgage loan 
to purchase the median-priced, existing single-family home, up from 17% in 
August but still down from 22% a year ago. In the Los Angeles region, 14% could 
qualify to purchase the median-priced home, up from 12%. At the September 
median price of $221,954 in Los Angeles, a household here needed an annual 
income of $73,118 and faced monthly mortgage payments of $1,828.

IN BID TO BOOST IMAGE, MAZDA RECRUITS CHRYSLER EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a campaign to improve its image in the United States, Mazda Motor of 
America in Irvine said Wednesday that it has hired Chrysler's marketing manager 
to serve as senior vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Clark J. Vitulli, 43, has spent the past 20 years with Chrysler Corp. in a 
variety of sales and marketing positions. He was California regional sales 
manager when he was chosen in September, 1987, to head national marketing and 
advertising for Chrysler vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America, said Vitulli was hired to 
bring in "a fresh outside perspective." He said Mazda was especially interested 
in Vitulli's experience in marketing Chrysler Corp.'s luxury line. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Mazda appointed a task force to study establishing a separate 
luxury brand in the United States, as Nissan, Toyota and Honda have done with 
their Infiniti, Lexus and Acura lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler marque has not been the star of Chrysler Corp.'s stable -- that 
honor goes to the Jeeps and minivans of the company's Plymouth and Dodge 
divisions. But industry analysts say Vitulli did a good job with the product he 
was given. 
</P>
<P>
"Chrysler has struggled in the upper end of the market against General Motors' 
Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln and Lincoln Town Car . . . without changing its 
product often enough," said Arvid Jouppi, automotive analyst for Keane 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Jouppi said Vitulli "has a good reputation but is just not part of the 
(Chrysler Chairman) Lee Iacocca inner circle." 
</P>
<P>
As senior vice president and general manager, Vitulli becomes the senior 
American official at Mazda. The position has existed in Mazda's management 
charts since the Japanese auto maker formed its U.S. subsidiary 16 months ago, 
but this is the first time it has been filled. 
</P>
<P>
Vitulli, who could not be reached for comment, starts work on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda recently launched a five-year campaign to build name recognition and 
upgrade its image among American consumers by emphasizing the quality of its 
product rather than its price. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda, which boosted its U.S. advertising budget to more than $200 million from 
last year's $150 million, ranks fourth among the Japanese auto makers and is 
not nearly as well known as Nissan, Toyota and Honda, company spokesman Al 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tremendous success of the new Miata sports car has not given the Mazda 
name a big push among consumers. "Everyone knows 'Miata,' but a lot of people 
don't put Mazda together with it," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster its image and its name identification, Mazda needs a major marketing 
push, and that is Vitulli's forte. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has done little to build any kind of an image until this year," 
said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, a Los Angeles-based automotive 
advertising research firm. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the Japanese companies seem to be chasing the Germans, and it looks 
like they all will be clustering in that luxury car niche," Hillson said. "Then 
there will be a lot of overlap at the high end of the market. And that means 
Vitulli has a tough job ahead of him, because there is a big question as to 
just how much that high-end niche can handle."

CAMPBELL CHIEF QUITS, SPURRING TALK OF TAKEOVER

<P>
Campbell Soup Co. said Wednesday that its chief executive was retiring early, 
and the news sparked renewed takeover speculation, sending the company's stock 
sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's stock shot up $3.125 to $46.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The latest sign of turmoil at the Camden, N.J.-based soup maker revived the 
takeover rumors swirling around the company since the death in April of its 
patriarch, Chairman John Dorrance Jr., the son of the company's founder. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of R. Gordon McGovern, 63, follows a restructuring that 
included layoffs and plant closings at the once-paternalistic company, which 
has been changing since Dorrance's death. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said McGovern was retiring early for personal reasons. But industry 
analysts speculated that he may have been pushed out or decided to leave 
because of infighting. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern's retirement "is not a surprise," said John McMillin at 
Prudential-Bache Securities. "The company was struggling under his leadership 
and basically a change was needed." 
</P>
<P>
"One one side, he had some good product lines and got the company moving 
ahead," Wheat First Securities analyst John Maxwell said of McGovern. "On the 
other side, it seemed he never could get the whole company working together." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of low profits, a depressed stock price and brand-name assets 
make Campbell particularly vulnerable to a takeover. Its well-known canned 
soups and other food brands, such as Franco-American, V-8 Juice and Swanson 
frozen foods, are considered valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it has named Senior Vice Presidents Herbert Baum, 53, and 
Edwin Harper, 47, as executive vice presidents. Responsibility for day-to-day 
operations will be divided between the two, pending the selection of a new 
chief executive to succeed McGovern, who was with the company for more than 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said both Baum and Harper, among others, are candidates for the post 
of chief executive. McMillin said Baum was the probably the leading candidate 
among the insiders. Baum is president of Campbell U.S.A., Campbell's main 
operating unit, while Harper is chief financial officer.

SOVIETS LOOK INTO OFFERING BOND ISSUE IN U.S. MARKETS 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet Union, warming up to Wall Street, is considering a bond offering in 
American financial markets once longstanding debts to the U.S. government 
incurred by pre-1917 czarist regimes are settled, bankers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has been talked around," a top New York banker said in an interview. 
"If the czarist bonds are settled, they'd be free and clear." 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Security Policy, a conservative Washington think tank, said that 
several big U.S. banks were recently invited to lead the underwriting of a 
$250-million Soviet bond issue and that Citibank had accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Oleg Enoukov, senior manager at the New York office of the Soviet Bank for 
Foreign Economic Affairs, denied that an offer had been made but said once the 
pre-revolution claims are cleared, "in the future, it may make this (bond 
issue) possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet bank office was established last summer to seek new business 
opportunities, Enoukov said. "We're just exploring new possibilities of doing 
business with American banks and financial institutions," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Citibank denied that the bank had already accepted a Soviet 
offer. "Any discussions at this point are at an extremely early stage," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's interest in borrowing in the United States coincides with a crisis in 
the Soviet Union as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev struggles to institute 
economic reforms, a subject likely to be on the agenda when he meets President 
Bush aboard ships in the Mediterranean next month. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Soviets can borrow here, they have to meet the terms of the 1934 
Johnson Debt Default Act, which bars credit to countries in default to the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"Their ability to float bonds in the United States would be dependent on their 
getting off the Johnson Act," one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States lent some $192.6 million to Alexander Kerensky, who was prime 
minister in a provisional government in 1917 before being overthrown by the 
Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has since refused to honor the debt, but last year it began 
settlement negotiations with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union gained re-entry to the London bond market after reaching a 
similar settlement with Britain two years ago.

NYSE CHIEF BACKS SEC CONTROL OVER PROGRAM TRADING

Under pressure to calm Wall Street volatility, New York Stock Exchange Chairman 
John J. Phelan Jr. said Wednesday that he generally favored giving the 
Securities and Exchange Commission new powers to short-circuit computer-driven 
program trading. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Phelan had taken the view that program trading strategies were 
here to stay, suggesting that investors should learn to live with a volatile 
market. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday he said he "would favor giving the SEC the power to stop 
program trading if we can work out the language and how it should be done." 
</P>
<P>
Phelan spoke briefly with reporters after testifying before a closed session of 
a House subcommittee reviewing Wall Street reform legislation that would, in 
part, give the SEC new powers to deal with volatile markets. 
</P>
<P>
But Phelan made it clear that the issue was very complex and said he would work 
with the Congress and the SEC to design safeguards that would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading is computer-assisted buying or selling of large amounts of 
stocks in conjunction with stock index futures and options at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
That trading was suspected as the cause of the October, 1987, crash and a 
recent bout of volatile trading that began with a 190-point Dow industrials 
plunge on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee looking into 
possible market reforms, said one possible change was to allow the SEC to halt 
all stock exchange trading for 24 hours, as well as to stop program trading, 
during huge market swings. 
</P>
<P>
Many on Wall Street believe that program trading in stock index arbitrage, the 
most common form of program trading, helped fuel the wild swings in the market 
that have dismayed small investors. 
</P>
<P>
Several major Wall Street brokerages have recently eliminated or cut back on 
computer-based program trading in response to increasingly vocal critics. Those 
that have reduced such trading include Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Paine 
Webber Group, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Wall Street sources said the New York Stock Exchange 
will explore proposals today to curb the volatility caused by program trading, 
including possibly reviving the "collar" that banned computer trading when 
stocks moved too sharply. 
</P>
<P>
The board's regular monthly meeting today will also consider other ways of 
holding down volatility in the face of growing discontent among the investing 
public, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The collar would prohibit the use of the NYSE automated order system for 
program trades whenever the Dow Jones industrial index moved to a 50-point gain 
or loss in a session.

HISTORY: LEON TROTSKY'S GRANDSON, ESTEBAN VOLKOV, WANTS TO ENSURE THAT HIS 
GRANDFATHER IS RESTORED TO HIS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN SOVIET HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All over the world, bad things happened to people close to young Esteban 
Volkov. Usually they died. 
</P>
<P>
His mother committed suicide in Berlin. His father reportedly was shot to death 
in a Soviet concentration camp. In Paris, an uncle succumbed mysteriously after 
a routine appendectomy. Later, it was determined that the uncle almost 
certainly was poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, Volkov himself was almost killed once as he huddled under his 
bed while bullets, meant for his grandfather, slammed around him, including one 
that grazed his foot. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 30 relatives died in the intrigues that followed the founding 
of the world's first Marxist nation. 
</P>
<P>
But all of it was small potatoes compared with the day in August, 1940, when an 
assassin finally got close to his grandfather and drove an ax into his skull, 
the final move in a long-distance game of ruthlessness. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov's grandfather was Leon Trotsky, revolutionary, former commander of the 
Red Army, a founding father of the Soviet state and arch foe of Josef Stalin, 
dictator of the Soviet Union who branded Trotsky an enemy of the revolution and 
forced him into exile in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as the Soviet Union reassesses its past, Trotsky's life and the manner 
of his death reverberate with both contemporary and historical significance. 
For instance, nearly 50 years later -- in the age of glasnost -- the Trotsky 
connection still has the power to catapult Volkov, now 63, from his cloistered, 
almost apolitical life as a Mexico City chemist into a global debate about his 
fiery grandfather's political legacy and his proper place in the new Soviet 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't ask for political rehabilitation because he doesn't need political 
rehabilitation. We want historical truth. . . . Truth is a basic element of 
progress. We cannot go anywhere without the truth," Volkov said in a Los 
Angeles interview. 
</P>
<P>
Until very recently Trotsky was officially a "devil" in the Soviet pantheon, a 
spy and murderer who schemed against the establishment of Stalin's utopia. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, Volkov has been traveling the United States with French 
historian Pierre Broue, author of a recent, huge biography of Trotsky, seeking 
to draw attention to his grandfather and possibly accelerate the fresh look at 
the Stalin era within the Soviet Union. At issue is whether Trotsky will be 
fully recognized for his role, probably second only to Lenin, in the founding 
of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Trotsky, apparently on orders of Stalin, silenced one of the 
dictator's most articulate enemies and a key architect of the Bolshevik 
Revolution that established the Soviet government. It's generally agreed that 
the killing gave Stalin even more latitude to rewrite history -- to minimize, 
distort and often erase the role played by the man who might have succeeded 
Lenin as leader of the first communist state. Other early revolutionaries such 
as Nikolai Bukharin and Grigory Zinoviev recently have been cleared of crimes 
alleged by Stalin and restored to official history. 
</P>
<P>
And after decades of suppression, a few of Trotsky's works have been published 
in the Soviet Union, but the body of his vast output remains unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Trotsky himself recently has been recognized as an important figure by Soviet 
historians, although he continues to be criticized as an ambitious schemer who 
sought to become a dictator himself, a point hotly disputed by some Trotsky 
backers. His true character as a political leader probably will continue to be 
a source of debate because his ideas on implementing Marxism were never really 
put to the test. 
</P>
<P>
While Volkov and historian Broue said they are not satisfied with Trotsky's 
somewhat improved status, they conceded surprise at the speed with which the 
Soviets are rewriting their history. 
</P>
<P>
Broue noted that an excerpt from his book was recently published in the Soviet 
Union and that the biography may be issued in all its heftiness -- three 
pounds, 1,100 pages -- in Russian before it appears in English. Broue, a 
professor of history at the University of Grenoble, is director of the French 
Leon Trotsky Institute, publisher of Trotsky's complete works in the French 
language. (Broue will be among the speakers at a panel on Trotsky and Stalinism 
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Patriotic Hall, 1816 S. Figueroa St.) 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, Volkov and Broue have traveled to the Soviet Union, making 
contact with small groups of Trotsky's supporters there and speaking at small 
rallies. Volkov has been interviewed by the Soviet press. However, neither 
apparently will be truly satisfied until Trotsky achieves historical equality 
with other makers of the Bolshevik Revolution who have retained or regained 
their proper eminence. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Volkov's quest for his grandfather's heritage began with a lie. Two 
years ago, a French magazine reported that Volkov had been invited to Moscow 
for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the communist revolution. While 
the story was untrue, Volkov's quiet life was destroyed by a barrage of phone 
calls from reporters around the world. "It started a huge interest that hasn't 
stopped," Volkov said. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov seems to enjoy the attention won by his link to momentous events and 
important people. It is a "privilege," he said, to be part of the "fascinating 
historical moment" when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost 
has opened a window to his own past. 
</P>
<P>
It is a moment for which Volkov paid dearly. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov remembers his grandfather as a kindly man surrounded by a fascinating 
collection of hangers-on and visitors at his house in Mexico City. For a boy in 
his early teens, it was a welcome change from the orphan's life he had led in 
Europe, Volkov said. 
</P>
<P>
But there was danger in living with an exiled enemy of one of the world's most 
powerful men. In the early hours of May 24, 1939, men armed with Thompson 
submachine guns attacked the Trotsky house, firing more than 100 bullets into 
Trotsky's bedroom and that of his grandson next door. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov recalled that he was awakened by the sound of a door to the outside 
opening and that he then saw the silhouette of a man. He threw himself under 
his bed when the firing began and somehow escaped serious injury, although 
several bullets were fired through the mattress, Volkov said. 
</P>
<P>
During that attempt, Volkov said his grandfather was befuddled by sleeping 
pills and initially thought that the gunshots were firecrackers. Trotsky's wife 
saved him by dragging him from bed to the shelter of a corner. 
</P>
<P>
The next year Trotsky did not escape the attack by an ax-wielding assailant. 
Volkov remembered that he was coming home from school and noticed an unusual 
number of cars and people in the street near his grandfather's house. He went 
into the house and peeked through a crack in a door to see his grandfather 
lying wounded on the floor. Trotsky, who was still conscious and did not die 
until the next day, ordered, " 'Keep the boy away. He shouldn't see this,' " 
Volkov said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a century later, Volkov has not converted this dramatic scene into 
a justification of Soviet sainthood for his grandfather. Particularly as 
commander of the Red Army, his grandfather practiced violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the violence of history," he added. "That's how history is 
accomplished." He simply wants the past put into the proper perspective, he 
explained, not only for his grandfather but for all the victims of the Stalin 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I would not like Trotsky to become an icon," he said.

CITY AT A CROSSROADS; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: LOS ANGELES HAS A CHOICE: SHOULD IT REMAIN TRUE TO ITS ROOTS OR 
PATTERN ITS DEVELOPMENT AFTER NEW YORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Here are a couple of location shots from a Los Angeles movie scripted to give a 
quick fix on the dramatic contrasts of the city's skyline: 
</P>
<P>
Long shot: Seen from the brow of the Brentwood hilltop, Los Angeles sprawls 
toward the Pacific like a loosely woven quilt thrown over the rough brown back 
of the semi-desert landscape. The Wilshire Boulevard corridor runs like a 
dinosaur spine from downtown to the ocean, poking up high-rise spikes in the 
dusty evening light. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up: At the corner of Wilshire and Westwood boulevards, glittering towers 
crowd the sky, grinding the person on the sidewalk into insignificance. Caught 
between the horizontal metallic crush of cars and the gleaming upright slabs, 
the individual feels like nothing more than a ghostly smudge in this hard-edged 
urbanity. 
</P>
<P>
The first shot could only be taken in Los Angeles. Unlike any other major city, 
its scale is humane, loosely textured and emotionally unoppressive, offering an 
unequalled sense of spaciousness. The low-rise skyline, in which landscape and 
architecture are intimately woven together, epitomizes the Angelization of the 
American metropolis. The second shot, which could be taken in any major U.S. 
city, captures the claustrophobic Manhattanization of Los Angeles that has 
provoked so many Westside and Valley residents into a revolution against 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Angelization or Manhattanization -- this is the profound choice Los Angeles 
faces as the city's boundless commercial vigor and increasing cultural 
sophistication continues to attract waves of new residents from all over the 
the world. Shouldn't the city enhance its inherent style rather than trash its 
heritage in search of an alien image now largely discredited elsewhere? "Los 
Angeles is up against the wall," said Robert Harris, dean of architecture at 
USC. "It faces a challenge most U.S. cities have failed to meet successfully in 
recent decades -- how to grow more densely populated without sacrificing a 
humane scale based on each man's sense of belonging. At heart, it's a question 
of identity." 
</P>
<P>
Like Harris, a number of L.A.'s prominent architects and urban designers have 
been pondering the problem in discussion groups, in forums and on their drawing 
boards. From this dialogue, debate and hands-on experience, some constructive 
ideas are starting to surface. They offer alternatives to the urban pathology 
that has consumed New York. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles, Century City, Westwood along Wilshire, stretches of 
Ventura Boulevard and Warner Center in Woodland Hills have already fallen 
victim to Manhattanization. Other areas fear the heavy tread of approaching 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Manhattan model argue that the appetite for low-rise growth, 
which has covered the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys with so many suburbs 
since World War II, has gobbled up almost all the available land in Southern 
California. The suburbs are creeping into the Mojave desert at Palmdale and 
Lancaster, and chewing up miles of farmland in the Inland Empire. But that does 
not really answer the needs of people who want to live close to the best jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "The City as a Work of Art," Vassar College history professor 
Donald J. Olsen demonstrates that some cities, such as London, Paris and 
Vienna, can be perceived as "works of art rather than instances of social 
pathology." Manhattan, in Olsen's view, is a typically "pathological" U.S. city 
shaped solely by the market, with only marginal intervention of the creative 
imagination committed to "set forth the grander and larger purposes of life." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles, the most Manhattanized section of the city, is a poor 
copy of the New York model that crowds commercial and residential towers in a 
cluster of clunky stalagmites. A pattern of skyscrapers set cheek-by-jowl, 
begun in the 1960s and '70s, today dictates the form of L.A.'s urban core. 
</P>
<P>
At the crown of Bunker Hill, a phalanx of commercial, civic and cultural 
buildings creates a dense precinct along Grand Avenue. The core of this 
mini-Manhattan is the planned Disney Hall music complex, designed by Frank 
Gehry, and Arata Isozaki's Museum of Contemporary Art. Linking them is the 
massive, partially completed California Plaza development, which, when 
completed in the mid-1990s, will include three office towers, a 440-room hotel 
and three high-rise condominium buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a density of building on Bunker Hill to justify the economics of 
development based on the very high price of land," said Nyal Leslie, president 
of Metropolitan Structures West, the California Plaza developers. "Mid-rise 
buildings simply wouldn't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial investment is so intense on Bunker Hill that there is no 
stopping the march of the towers. As far as Angelization goes, downtown is a 
write-off -- a monster created by the profit motive and abetted by 
short-sighted municipal politics. But Los Angeles still has a chance to be true 
to its own home-grown destiny, said architect Jon Jerde. He believes "the eyes 
of the world are upon us in this endeavor. Every major city looks to Los 
Angeles for an urban style that offers an alternative to the Manhattan model, 
which has proven so unpleasant and essentially inhuman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Centers Concept' 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s first formal attempts to grapple with the nature of its unique urban 
character date to the late 1960s. Los Angeles adopted a "Centers Concept" that 
proposed restricting high-rise development, both residential and commercial, to 
about 45 areas ranging in intensity from downtown's skyscraper cluster to less 
densely built-up cores, such as Warner Center and Westwood Village. By 
concentrating vertical growth in these centers, planners hoped to preserve the 
city's low-rise, single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Century City is the most prominent offspring of the Centers Concept. Popping up 
beside the pleasant, shady avenues of Beverly Hills, Century City's towers have 
the air of overgrown and unsuitable guests who have long outstayed their 
welcomes. When location scouts for one of the sequels to the movie "Planet of 
the Apes" were searching for a backdrop that epitomized the inhumanity of the 
modern metropolis, they chose Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"Century City is not the way for L.A. to go," said architect Barton Myers. 
"Apart from the fact that such a conglomeration of skyscrapers demands a public 
transit system that would cost the earth to build, they run counter to the 
basic urban traditions of the city." 
</P>
<P>
These urban traditions include the ample, low-rise, tree-lined character of 
most of our older districts or "urban villages." These urban villages are 
threaded together by the sinews of "linear downtowns," such as the 17-mile 
stretch of Wilshire Boulevard between Bunker Hill and Santa Monica. Los Angeles 
invented the car-oriented linear downtown in the early 1930s, beginning with 
the stretch of Wilshire Boulevard that runs past Bullocks. 
</P>
<P>
The widely admired urban design pattern that L.A. best embodies is dubbed the 
"multi-citied city." In this model, the metropolis is made up of a 
"constellation" of urban villages interconnected by common concerns. These 
self-centered districts are not focused on a Manhattan-style urban core that 
massively dominates the economic, social and cultural life of the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles grew in a unique way as a collection of small towns that knitted 
together to create the metropolitan region we inherit," Myers said. "This is 
our tradition, which we must embrace and enhance, rather than import alien 
models that have failed elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Myers is fond of pointing out that cities don't have to be built high to be 
built densely. As the head of the design review committee for the proposed 
$1-billion Hollywood Redevelopment Project, Myers advocates a mid-rise solution 
for Hollywood Boulevard and its environs rather than a row of skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers has prepared a series of studies that demonstrate that, by covering an 
area with horizontal buildings instead of sticking a free-standing tower on an 
empty plaza in the middle of each lot, you can achieve the same density of 
population while keeping the skyline low and honoring the established street 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The population of many L.A. districts could be doubled, many designers say, by 
building low-profile "in-fill" housing, which would add units to the deep back 
yards of existing single-family houses. This would enable an area to 
accommodate more people without radically altering the essential character of 
settled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program could have a substantial positive impact on L.A.'s housing 
shortage without changing the city's "look." 
</P>
<P>
Another urban model favored by many architects is based on the traditional 
American college campus. In this model, seen locally at UCLA in Westwood, low- 
to mid-rise buildings are integrated with park-like public spaces, which gives 
a sense of spacious shelter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An L.A. Layout' 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA is a densely populated mini-city of 50,000 daytime inhabitants who seldom 
feel oppressed by their built environment," said Richard Weinstein, dean of the 
UCLA Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. "The layout is very 
L.A. in its unrigid free form that is simultaneously complex, easy to 
understand and pleasant to be in." The pressure of population density and the 
press of development bears down differently on each of L.A.'s diverse 
neighborhoods. While the Westside, downtown and sections of the Valley are 
coveted by developers, South Central and East Los Angeles are thirsty for 
dollars to revive run-down neighborhoods and provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
A border area between these separate realities is the district now known as 
Central City West, which is on the west side of the Harbor Freeway opposite 
downtown. Central City West's 150 acres, home to a number of legal and illegal 
immigrants, is poised on the verge of massive redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to find visual and human clues that are intrinsic to the nature of 
one of L.A.'s oldest neighborhoods," said Cliff Allen, the architect in charge 
of planning Central City West. He hopes to avoid creating the kind of overbuilt 
high-rise scenario that discourages a sense of community and depresses the soul 
of urban man. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go along, we will try to strike a balance between a democratic, 
participatory process and the need to shape the district as a humane 
environment. We hope it will be a model for reviving run-down sections of the 
city to accommodate more people." While these examples demonstrate how L.A.'s 
existing districts might be developed to greater density without 
Manhattanization, several major projects on virgin land are attempting to 
express a uniquely Angelized city form. 
</P>
<P>
The 900 acres of Playa Vista, between Westchester and Marina del Rey, will be 
carved into coherent mini-neighborhoods, each with its own village-style 
stores, parks and public squares based on a pedestrian's pace and an active 
street life. 
</P>
<P>
Playa Vista will be laid out in two- and three-story residential clusters; no 
commercial building will be taller than 10 stories. Instead, the emphasis of 
the plan will be on its public, rather than private, spaces, including streets, 
plazas and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than develop raw real estate without concern for the quality of life," 
said developer Nelson Rising of Maguire Thomas Partners, "we see this as a 
chance to create a real community from the ground up, complete with all the 
vital civic and commercial services." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Jerde has designed a unique $2-billion "Entertainment City" planned around 
the studios of Universal City. Jerde's innovative idea is the creation of a 
vast, low, dome-like development on the crest of Universal's hill that mixes 
entertainment areas, including the popular Universal Studios Tour, with 
offices, shops and housing. Meandering avenues lined with sidewalk cafes link 
plazas and parks, and offer open views of the San Gabriel and Santa Monica 
mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Skyscrapers are not entirely alien to Los Angeles. We have a home-grown 
tradition of tower buildings, such as City Hall, the Capitol Records building 
in Hollywood or Sunset Tower -- now the St.James Club -- on Sunset Boulevard. 
But the architectural character of truly Angeleno towers depends on their being 
spaced far enough apart from one another so that each one reads separately on 
the skyline. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Johnson, designer of the prominently isolated Fox Plaza high-rise in 
Century City, explains that towers spaced far apart is the model Frank Lloyd 
Wright proposed for his ideal American city plan, called Broadacre City. 
</P>
<P>
"Wright saw the skyscraper as an archetypal American construction that could 
enjoy the spaciousness of our cities, especially in the West," he said. 
"Clustering them close together in the usual Century City way is un-Angeleno." 
</P>
<P>
"When did Los Angeles abandon its aspirations to be one of the great cities of 
Western civilization and settle for just being large?" asked Kurt Meyer, a 
prominent architect who is a former chairman of the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. "We saw in the special way we handled the 1984 Olympics that we have a 
dynamic urban environment that has capitalized on its geography and its human 
talents to make L.A. a truly world-class city, in its own unique style."

SCIENTIST FIGHTS A 2ND DUST BOWL 
</P>

By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SALINA, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to legend, the 16th-Century Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de 
Coronado stood on a grassy butte 10 miles south of here and scanned the horizon 
in disappointment. The rumored city of gold that he was seeking was nowhere in 
sight, just mile after grassy mile of prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Jackson, an explorer of another kind, also scans the horizon here with a 
hard heart. What he wants to see is real prairie -- firm sod of big bluestem 
and Indian grasses and a dozen other deep-rooted plants that brace the soil 
against wind and rain and man. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what Jackson sees in the Kansas midlands is a patchwork of 
cultivation, land tilled and laced with chemicals to maximize production. He 
sees ecological ruin under way in the form of erosion, contaminated ground 
water and tainted food. A child of Depression-era Kansas, Jackson has fashioned 
his own response to an agriculture that he believes will prove to be as ruinous 
as the Dust Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, he founded the Land Institute, a think tank on the prairie, 
classrooms for students and experimental plots for researchers. His idea is to 
turn Kansas farmland back to prairie, harvest the seeds of wild rye and other 
wild grasses, let nature's wisdom prevail. 
</P>
<P>
It is at once "a deep probe into the future and a deep probe into the past," 
Jackson likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekend, a tweedy clutch of academics, environmental activists and 
researchers convened at the Land Institute, attracted by Jackson's radical but 
enduring experiment at his 100-acre prairie laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has a doctorate in plant genetics, convened the group to consider 
an issue that recently has come to permeate the public policy debate on 
agriculture-the environmental impact of farming practices. The symposium was 
dubbed "The Marriage of Ecology and Agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting on a rise above the Smoky Hill River outside Salina crackled with 
current flowing between two poles -- the prairie stoicism of Jackson and the 
dark anger of a Kentucky agrarian poet named Wendell Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson presided over the event more with his presence than his words. In 
interviews, he invoked the Pre-Industrial past as a guide to the future, but he 
acknowledged readily that his prairie experiment may falter and indeed that 
mankind "may not pull through." 
</P>
<P>
"The human experiment may fail," he said blandly. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, a tall and spindly man who resembles Jimmy Stewart in the role of a 
fire-and-brimstone Baptist preacher, cut through the drone of the symposium's 
academic discussion like a knife. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time now," he said, "we have understood ourselves as traveling 
toward some sort of industrial paradise, some new Eden conceived and 
constructed entirely by human ingenuity. . . . Now we face overwhelming 
evidence that we are not smart enough to recover Eden by assault and that 
nature does not tolerate or excuse our abuses. If, in spite of the evidence 
against us, we are finding it hard to relinquish our old ambition, we are also 
seeing more clearly every day how that ambition has reduced and enslaved us." 
</P>
<P>
Later, with Jackson looking on from the wings like a mortician at a funeral, 
Cornell University entomologist David Pimentel enumerated the grim trends of 
modern agriculture. Erosion, he said, is proceeding at 20 times the rate of 
replenishment; in 150 years, Iowa has lost one-half of its topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, American agriculture is responsible for 81% of the nation's 
water use and is soaking up aquifers at an alarming rate, especially in Kansas. 
Pesticides, Pimentel said, are being dumped on the land at a rate of 1 billion 
pounds a year, yet pests are destroying larger and larger portions of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
The paradoxical result, he and others assert, is pest proliferation on farms 
where large-scale methods are in use. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's vision of prairie agriculture does not provide a complete fix for all 
of these troubling trends. The grasses he hopes to cultivate in a "domestic 
prairie" promise a lower-yielding form of agriculture, one designed to 
complement a small-is-beautiful kind of local economy. Such an economy 
presupposes a radical revision of American life. 
</P>
<P>
That theme of revision was woven through the three-day symposium, as speaker 
after speaker proposed modifications to the status quo. Ironically, the only 
participant to offer an unequivocal celebration of the American landscape was 
Eugene Ryabov, a visiting Soviet soil-conservation specialist. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of a dinner program, Ryabov recited favorite verses in thickly 
accented English, minus the music: 
</P>
<P>
Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play. 
</P>
<P>
 Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all 
day.

<P>
California State University trustees approved a 4.8% tuition increase Wednesday 
for most of the system's nearly 370,000 students in a move expected to generate 
$16 million in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said the hike was consistent with the Maddy Act 
of 1984 that provides for fee increases in line with rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
Fees will climb from $708 to $744 a year for students taking more than six 
units. Students taking fewer than that will face an $18 increase -- from $408 a 
year to $426, or 4.4%. Non-resident tuition will remain at $189 per semester 
unit and $126 per quarter unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still at the very, very lowest (in student tuition costs) compared with 
other state university systems," said Steve MacCarthy, a spokesman for the 
system. "We probably are still in the bottom 5% in terms of student fees." 
</P>
<P>
MacCarthy said students at Penn State, for instance, pay $3,754 per year in 
fees, and their Illinois State counterparts pay $2,249. The figures are $1,754 
at Louisiana State University and $1,350 at the State University of New York, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the increase proposal been rejected, he said, the additional funding would 
have come from the state's general revenue fund.

FOR THE TEACHERS, TRICK IS ON THEM ; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: TOO MANY TREATS ARE BLAMED FOR STUDENTS' DAY-AFTER-HALLOWEEN 'ANTSY' 
BEHAVIOR. BUT PHYSICIANS SAY SUGAR 'HANGOVERS' ARE NOT THE REASON.

For children, it was the morning after a fine and memorable evening. For their 
teachers, Wednesday was the worst day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like adults with hangovers," said Mesa Verde Preschool director Karen 
Mestemacher, who like others were coping with the effects of too much 
Halloween. "They're antsy; they can't settle down," she said of the 2- to 
5-year-olds who had been trick-or-treating the night before. "Tempers seem to 
be short. In the yard, there are more minor accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of two-hour naps, the toddlers' eyes were wide open after 45 minutes. 
"Needless to say, it's a zoo around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit, teachers believe, is the ultimate joy of Halloween -- sugar. 
</P>
<P>
"Many have candy along with breakfast. They bring candy for snack. They have 
candy for lunch," said Kathleen Pommer, a teacher at Turtle Rock Elementary 
School in Irvine. "They come in on a high. Before recess, they're really down. 
At recess they have more candy and they're high again. By lunch, they're pretty 
well down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a roller coaster." 
</P>
<P>
Some just wrote the day off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a common joke in teaching," said Diane Moline, a teacher at Taft 
Elementary School in Orange. "It's the kind of day you do a lot of PE." 
</P>
<P>
Some reported a slightly higher degree of absenteeism. "One mother who kept her 
daughter home described it to me," Mestemacher said. "She said: 'You wouldn't 
want her around today. She'll see you tomorrow.' We thanked her for that." 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the common wisdom that blames sugar highs for hyperactivity, 
physicians and researchers said scientific studies have yet to prove the link. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Grant Gwinup, professor of endocrinology at UCI College of Medicine, called 
the idea that sugar causes hyperactivity an "old wives' tale." While he 
admitted the caffeine in chocolate may be stimulating, he said, "you're dealing 
with mythology rather than scientific medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Dr. James Swanson, a psychologist and specialist in hyperactivity at 
UC Irvine's Child Development Center, said: "The bottom line is that parents 
keep reporting sugar affects behavior and studies have failed to document that. 
It may be things other than sugar that are (causing) the effects." 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have suggested that food dyes or caffeine may be responsible, he 
said. Others speculate the effect may be psychological. "Children are getting 
excessive rewards all at once," Swanson said. "If you gave toy trucks instead 
of candy, the same thing may happen." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers accepted partial responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the teacher's favorite holidays as far as stuff you can teach," 
Moline said. "The younger kids are very excitable and teachers do a lot more 
Halloween stuff with them. So in a way, we build the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
But still, the teachers said it would help if parents curtailed the candy their 
children consume. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if parents had 30 children in their house for six hours, they would 
think twice before they allowed them to have that candy," Pommer said.

JUDGE PUSHES PLAN TO LET INS IDENTIFY ALIEN CRIMINALS WHILE THEY'RE IN COURTS 
</P>

<P>
Thousands of illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes, including murder and 
drug trafficking, escape deportation because immigration authorities are not 
trying to identify them in state courts, an Orange County judge told a 
congressional panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who has established an unusual program in 
his courtroom to allow immigration officials to check the citizenship of 
convicted felons, urged Congress to take steps to ensure that other 
jurisdictions adopt the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's program is believed to be the only such effort in the country, 
according to congressional aides and immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Carter testified before the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary 
Committee, which is considering legislation that would expand the arrest powers 
of federal immigration agents. The committee is also studying the more 
fundamental problem of how to deal with illegal aliens who commit serious 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to determine the number of criminals who are in the 
country illegally, Carter and others said the problem is substantial. One 
immigration official told the panel that state and federal prisons house more 
than 120,000 aliens, not necessarily illegal, who are deportable because of 
their criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service generally does not try to identify 
illegal aliens among the criminal population until after they are incarcerated, 
according to an official of the General Accounting Office who testified at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"This strategy . . . is not effective in dealing with all deportable aliens 
because, for example, they may receive a probationary or suspended sentence," 
said Lowell Dodge, director of the justice section of the GAO, the 
investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, aliens -- both legal and illegal -- become deportable if 
they are convicted of so-called aggravated felonies such as murder, robbery, 
drug dealing or other serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"A primary focus of the (INS) . . . should be the deportation of illegal 
immigrant narcotics offenders out of the state courts," Carter told the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government's "drug war" has tended to focus on the federal level 
and failed to recognize that most offenders are under state jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, INS was not invited into the state courts," he said. "The result 
is that the vast majority of illegal immigrant drug dealers are not deported by 
INS." 
</P>
<P>
The program Carter instituted a year ago is intended to correct that problem, 
the judge said, by identifying criminals who are in the country illegally 
before they are released on probation or shipped off to county jail or state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Identification of illegal aliens who have received probationary sentences 
permits them to be deported immediately instead of being allowed to remain in 
the country. And by placing an INS hold on convicts before they are 
incarcerated, officials ensure that the criminals will be subject to 
deportation upon their release from custody. 
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of 1989, Carter said INS identified as illegal 
aliens 36.4% of the 1,880 defendants in his court who were convicted of felony 
offenses or probation violations. 
</P>
<P>
Carter suggested that the federal government should require cooperation between 
state courts and federal immigration authorities for those states that receive 
federal aid for anti-drug programs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal met with an enthusiastic response from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), 
a subcommittee member who authored the bill to give immigration agents general 
arrest powers. 
</P>
<P>
"You are really doing something that is unique and of real benefit to this 
country, and it's incredible to me that it's not being duplicated elsewhere," 
Smith told Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said William J. Bennett, who heads the federal anti-drug effort, 
expressed interest in Carter's suggestion in a conversation Wednesday morning. 
Carter, however, said Bennett so far had ignored his request for an 
appointment. Smith said he would try to arrange a meeting.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO APPROVES ANNEXATION OF STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county commission voted Wednesday to allow the city to annex a strip of seven 
office buildings and six homes along Newport Boulevard, although some neighbors 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission unanimously approved annexation of the 
7.8-acre strip on the northwest side of the avenue between Wass Street and 
Windsor Lane in North Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a big chunk out of our community," said Nancy Hamilton, 35, a 
homemaker who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Removing the strip from the jurisdiction of the North Tustin Municipal Advisory 
Council denies local residents a say in the use of the property, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
The council advises the County Board of Supervisors on matters in 
unincorporated North Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Weber Jr., president of the Foothill Communities Assn., also opposed 
the annexation. The Tustin City Council, he said, could someday change the 
zoning to allow larger commercial ventures on the property. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Richard B. Edgar said the council has no plans to change the 
use of the land from residential and low-density office use. 
</P>
<P>
Before the annexation becomes official, the City Council must hold a hearing to 
allow landowners in the proposed annexation area to protest, LAFCO executive 
director James J. Colangelo said. If owners holding a majority of the assessed 
value of the land say they do not want to be in Tustin, he said, the annexation 
proposal dies. 
</P>
<P>
Most landowners have already requested annexation, so a protest is not likely, 
he said.

WESTMINSTER TAKES ANNEXATION STEP

<P>
Over the objections of Midway City residents, Westminster received first rights 
to annex that unincorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission voted to place Midway City, four small 
islands of territory near Beach Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue, in Westminster's 
area for planning purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Midway City do not want to be in the sphere of influence of 
Westminster," said Art Horne, president of the Midway City Chamber of Commerce 
and Homeowners Assn. "We don't need Westminster in Midway City." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster has no plans to annex Midway City, City Councilwoman Joy L. 
Neugebauer said. But because the area probably will be annexed someday, having 
first rights to annexation will help Westminster take the area into account 
when making long-range city plans. 
</P>
<P>
Residents oppose joining Westminster because the city charges its residents a 
5% utility tax, Horne said. Also, past attempts by Westminster to annex tiny 
pieces of Midway City have created ill feelings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Don R. Roth, a member of the commission, voted against the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Midway City one day will be annexed by Westminster, Roth said. But the 
commission should not force the issue while most Midway City residents strongly 
oppose it, he said. TOM MCQUEENEY

VIDEO CRITICAL OF GAY COMMUNITY TO AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly a week of arguing between local gay-rights critics and cable 
officials, a half-hour video lambasting the homosexual community is scheduled 
to air tonight at 10 on public access television. 
</P>
<P>
The program is to be repeated Friday and Saturday at 10 p.m. on Channel 3 by 
Community Cablevision in Irvine and parts of Newport Beach and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about having to provide equal time for political programming, cable 
officials had refused to air the show. But they reversed themselves after 
consultation with their lawyers and threats of legal action by the sponsor, the 
Irvine Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is pushing Measure N on Tuesday's ballot in Irvine, which would 
remove from an existing civil rights statute the provision banning 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping up their campaign in the final week, the pro-N forces also are sending 
mailers to local Republicans, which feature endorsements from the conservative 
California Republican Assembly and its local arm, the Greater Irvine Republican 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition is countering with mailers of its own, and public events are 
planned for this weekend to try to defeat the measure, which opponents call an 
invitation to bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
This week's pro-Measure N video, using newsreel footage and interviews, paints 
homosexuals as promiscuous and as a threat to traditional morality. 
</P>
<P>
Cable officials had wanted to cut from the video some sections that might be 
considered offensive but, nonetheless, agreed to air it in its entirety, said 
Community Cablevision general manager Denise Yaru. 
</P>
<P>
They did succeed in pushing its airing time back to 10 p.m. from 8:30 because 
of the content, despite objections by the Irvine Values Coalition. ERIC

MCDONALD HOUSE OPENS WEDNESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The beds haven't been made and the cupboards are still bare, but by Wednesday 
the Ronald McDonald House will be ready for its grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a home away from home for families of seriously ill children at 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County and other area hospitals. Children 
undergoing outpatient treatment may stay there as well. 
</P>
<P>
Families will pay $5 a night to stay in the powder-blue and white, three-story 
house on Batavia Street in Orange, said Herb Watson, executive director of the 
house. Those who cannot afford the fee will stay for free. 
</P>
<P>
Families will be referred to the house by social service workers at local 
hospitals. About 8% to 10% of children treated at CHOC for serious illnesses 
live outside the area, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Ronald McDonald house will join 125 others worldwide, five of 
them in California. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be the first in the world to open debt-free, thanks to more than 
400 individuals and organizations who have donated money, time and supplies, 
Watson said. Donations are still being received, and the house is registered 
with the Broadway's bridal registry. 
</P>
<P>
The actual cost of buying the land and building and supplying the house would 
have been about $2.4 million 
</P>
<P>
But more than $1 million was donated in goods and services, and the other 
million in cash came from donors, including Mary Moore Young of Fullerton, who 
gave $500,000 in memory of her husband, William. He founded Golden State Food 
Co., a food supplier for McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
The mattresses, the kitchen appliances, washers and dryers, the floor covering 
and much of the furniture was donated. 
</P>
<P>
The house has 20 bedrooms, a living room, dining room, library, play room, 
sanctuary, back yard with playground equipment and apartment for the live-in 
manager, Martha Winslow. SHANNON SANDS

4 JUVENILES ARRESTED IN FAKE GUN INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four juveniles in a pickup truck were arrested Wednesday after they threatened 
a motorist with a fake handgun in front of an elementary school on California 
Street, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
The female motorist, whom police did not identify, said the truck was being 
driven erratically and jumped a curb near a sidewalk filled with students 
leaving TeWinkle Elementary School, Sgt. John Pherrin said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
As the motorist attempted to get the truck's license number, Pherrin said, the 
youths brandished "what looked like a real weapon" and then they drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The woman notified police and gave a description of the truck, its occupants 
and license number, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol Officer Michael Sawaya, who spotted the truck, pulled it over into the 
parking lot of a restaurant near Victoria Street and Harbor Boulevard and was 
quickly joined by four other police cars. 
</P>
<P>
Pherrin said a knife, wooden club, and a fake gun were found in the truck.

CITY PLANNING PANEL MAY BE REINSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council is considering re-establishing the city's Planning Commission, 
which was disbanded in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, first raised in April, was discussed by the council at its meeting 
earlier this week. Councilman Walter Bowman, the leading proponent of bringing 
back the city board, said it would give residents a better chance to react to 
such issues as conditional use permits and land-use variances. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we're the only city in Orange County that doesn't have a planning 
commission," he said. "I think it's all about whether or not you're going to 
have good government, and I think good government requires that you have a 
hearing process. And we need more than we have now." 
</P>
<P>
City staff members estimate that it would cost $94,000 a year to run the 
commission, City Manager Darrell Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman countered that according to his own estimates, the cost would be much 
lower, about $23,000 a year.

Russell McCampbell, a 31-year-old San Diego man, was running to help a stricken 
Orange County driver Wednesday when he was hit and killed by a car. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported that John Antenucci of Laguna Niguel was 
driving north on I-805 at 3:40 a.m. when he took the Balboa Avenue off-ramp, 
ran through a sign, jumped the curb, plowed over a flower patch and ended up 
back on the freeway exit. His car rolled and ended upright. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said McCampbell ran across the freeway to aid Antenucci, but another 
vehicle then struck Antenucci's car, which in turn hit McCampbell. He was 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Antenucci was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of Sharp Memorial 
Hospital.

MEASURE M FOES CLAIM CAR-POOL COVER-UP

Caltrans and the Orange County Transportation Commission are "covering up" the 
fact that Orange County car-pool lanes are not attracting more drivers, 
opponents of Measure M -- a proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation -- 
alleged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With only days left before voters decide the fate of the ballot measure on Nov. 
7, Lester Berriman of Drivers for Highway Safety called a news conference to 
renew charges that the car-pool lanes are a failure and to urge voters to 
reject the half-cent sales tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Several reports show that the occupancy ratio on the (Costa Mesa) freeway has 
not changed significantly since before the (car-pool) lane was added," Berriman 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that officials of both the state Department of Transportation and 
the Transportation Commission are aware of the reports, which show that there 
has not been a significant increase in the percentage of drivers using the 
car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
He accused them of trying to hide that information from the public so as not to 
jeopardize support for Measure M, which would raise $3 billion for 
transportation improvements over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Hagen, Caltrans' chief deputy district director for project management in 
Orange County, denied the charges by Drivers for Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not covering up anything," Hagen said. "We're laying out all 
the facts." The car-pool lanes "are running very close to capacity during the 
peak period on the (Costa Mesa Freeway). . . . The number of car pools is 
increasing dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Berriman and other representatives of Drivers for Highway Safety have said that 
adding regular lanes to existing freeways, and building new freeways, are 
better solutions to Orange County's traffic problems than car-pool lanes.

<P>
The first time Dan McGwire ran onto the field for a football game as a freshman 
at the University of Iowa, a sellout crowd of 67,700 at Kinnick Stadium gave 
him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"They had heard so much about me before I got there, they were just glad I was 
there," McGwire said. "Something like that sends chills up and down your spine. 
The excitement of seeing that many people in a full stadium is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
But if McGwire, who transferred to San Diego State two years ago, were to 
receive the same recognition Saturday night against New Mexico, he might not 
notice. Forty-five thousand empty seats do not make much noise. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to an Aztec home game. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is down to an average of 20,507 per 
game this year, and the players say they feel the difference. They miss the 
excitement a large crowd generates, the rush those cheers give them and the 
support they provide at crucial points in a game. They long for a time when 
they too can count on a noisy crowd to enhance their home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd brings out the best in you," McGwire said. "You make a big play and 
the crowd starts cheering, and it makes you want to make another one and 
another one. It feeds on itself. I just hope we get the crowds back soon." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in a stadium that is three-quarters empty has lately become as much a 
part of an Aztec home game as lights, black jerseys and Monte Montezuma. It is 
not what several players said they envisioned college football would be like. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a small high school where the only people cheering for your were the 
20 or 30 people who came with you on the bus to the game," said Milt Wilson, a 
senior defensive end from Daniel Murphy High School in Los Angeles. "I figured 
when I got to college the crowds would be huge. I didn't think there would be 
this trouble getting people to come to the games." 
</P>
<P>
Average attendance for the Aztecs' first four home games is lowest in the 
Western Athletic Conference by more than 2,000 per game. This despite SDSU 
playing in the second largest stadium and being situated in the largest 
metropolitan area of any conference school. Crowds have ranged from a high of 
31,639 for the home opener against UCLA to 13,548 four weeks ago against Cal 
State Long Beach. It was the smallest SDSU crowd since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to a friend of mine in Los Angeles, and he said, 'You're drawing less 
than New Mexico,' " said Monty Gilbreath, the Aztecs' leading receiver. "It's 
hard to play in front of 13,000 people. That's 50,000 empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
"I come out to field punts, so I'm one of the first guys on the field for 
warmups. You look out there, and there is no one in the stands. You can't say 
that doesn't affect you." 
</P>
<P>
But while his players say they are bothered by the size of the crowd, Coach Al 
Luginbill said he will not use that to explain away some less-than-impressive 
home performances against Cal State Fullerton (41-41) and Long Beach (30-26 
victory). 
</P>
<P>
"That has nothing to do with it," Luginbill said. "They are lucky they have two 
people out there the way they played in those two ballgames. They go out and 
crush those teams and watch how many people start coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance was not always a problem at SDSU. For their first 15 seasons in San 
Diego Stadium, the Aztecs consistently averaged more than 30,000 per game and 
set a school record by averaging 42,040 in 1975. From 1967 through 1981, the 
smallest season average was 24,845 in 1980. In the eight seasons since, the 
Aztecs have averaged more than that only -- 31,723 per game during their 1986 
WAC championship season. 
</P>
<P>
The players say they understand why the ticket-buying public has stayed away. 
Several of the opponents -- Fullerton, Long Beach and Pacific -- have lacked 
marquee value, and the Aztecs have given them little to cheer about since their 
1986 Holiday Bowl appearance. But they said at least half of that is changing 
in that SDSU is winning again. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs enter Saturday night's WAC game against New Mexico having won three 
in a row and four of their past five to move over the .500 mark (4-3-1) for the 
first time since 1986. The players said they hope the victories will bring back 
the crowds but recognize that a 1-8 New Mexico team is a difficult sell, even 
for a winner. School officials are predicting a crowd of 15,000 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things to do in San Diego on a Saturday night," said John 
Wesselman, a senior nickel back and the team's leading tackler. "I think the 
fans look at who we are playing and decide if they want to go. If it is someone 
they think we should beat, and it won't be a good game, they do something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, a lot of people in San Diego have found that something else to do. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales are below preseason projections, Athletic Director Fred Miller has 
said. But he has declined to give specific figures except to say that the crowd 
of 31,639 for UCLA exceeded its goal. Attendance prospects for the remaining 
three home games are not encouraging. The projected crowd for New Mexico is 
below expections, as are the early estimates of 17,000 for Wyoming Nov. 11 and 
about 25,000 for Brigham Young Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
No one understands what the Aztecs are missing better than McGwire, their 
junior quarterback. He transferred from the Big 10, where large crowds in big, 
historic stadiums were commonplace. If there is there one aspect about playing 
football at Iowa that he misses, it would be the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I came that the crowds in the WAC would be smaller than the Big 
10," McGwire said. "I accept that. But I still miss it. Those stadiums were 
something special. Going into Michigan Stadium with 100,000 people cheering, it 
brings back the feeling of all the great players who have played there. You get 
the feeling you can be part of it, too." 
</P>
<P>
About the only time that McGwire and the other Aztecs play in front big crowds 
now is on the road. Sometimes they wish they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember going to Brigham Young two years ago," Wilson said. "It was cold, 
rainy day. The sky was gray, and the stadium was filled. The cheer went around 
the stadium. It started on one side with a 'B,' then 'Y,' then 'U,' then, 
'Cougars' The stadium shook, it was so loud. That can be intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs can only dream about a time when their home crowds will generate 
that kind of noise. Until then, they must make the most of the fans they have. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad for what we have," Gilbreath said. "I know this, I'd rather play in 
front of our 13,000 than on the road in front of Hawaii's 40,000." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State was without its three top running backs in practice Wednesday, 
but Coach Al Luginbill said he is hopeful all could be ready to play Saturday 
night against New Mexico. Darrin Wagner, the team's leading rusher and scorer, 
was out with the flu. Ron Slack, the regular starter, is sidelined with a groin 
pull. Curtis Butts, a sophomore walk-on, was given permission to miss practice 
to visit hospitalized family members. That left Kipp Jeffries, a freshman who 
has not played in a game, to handle the work load in practice. Luginbill said 
he his most concerned about Slack's recovery and said there was a possibility 
he would not play Saturday.

MAJOR CRIMES SHOOT UP 49.3% IN THIRD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of murders, rapes, robberies and assaults in Long Beach increased 
49.3% in the third quarter, compared to the same period last year, according to 
Police Department statistics released this week. 
</P>
<P>
Overall total reported crimes increased 12.8% in July, August and September, 
compared to the same quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The highest jump was in the number of robberies, which went from 676 last year 
to 1,055 during the same three months this year -- a 56% increase. 
</P>
<P>
While there was a 49.3% increase in the number of crimes against persons, there 
was a 17.2% increase in the number of crimes against property, including thefts 
and burglaries. But there also were sharp increases within that category. For 
example: commercial burglaries increased from 337 to 520, or 54.3%, and bicycle 
thefts increased from 627 to 823, or 31.2%.

Earthquake Aid 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 303 to 107, the House sent to President Bush a catchall spending 
bill providing disaster aid to California as well as money to run the 
government in these early weeks of fiscal 1990.The "continuing resolution" (HR 
423) is needed because Congress and Bush have failed to enact most of the 13 
appropriations bills for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides $1.1 billion for housing grants and other direct aid to 
victims of the Oct. 17 California earthquake, $1 billion to help repair 
highways damaged by the quake and more than $1 billion in Small Business 
Administration loans to help businesses. Some of the emergency aid may also go 
to victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to enact the continuing resolution including 
California disaster aid.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
The House failed to override President Bush's veto of a fiscal 1990 Department 
of Health and Human Services appropriations bill (HR 2990) that eased 
restrictions on Medicaid abortions. The231-191 vote fell short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to defeat the veto. Bush objected to language 
permitting Medicaid abortions when the pregnancy results from rape or incest. 
Added earlier by the House to HR 2990, the language would broaden existing law 
that permits Medicaid abortions only when the mother's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The House's failure to overcome Bush's opposition made it unnecessary for the 
Senate to also take up the veto and thus the abortion issue. Nor did the Senate 
vote on the liberalized abortion language when it gave final approval of HR 
2990 on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pro-abortion language and wanted to override 
the veto.

COLLEGE PARK EAST'S NAME STANDS TEST OF TIME

When it came time to name this north Seal Beach neighborhood, developers S 
&amp; S (Shapell &amp; Shapell) must have been feeling a trifle whimsical. A 
name like College Park East would seem to indicate the presence of, well, a 
college -- something on the lines of College Park, Md., home of the University 
of Maryland. But here there is no institution of higher learning closer than 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the name has at least stood the test of time. The then-unincorporated area 
was annexed to the city of Seal Beach in 1964, according to City Clerk Joanne 
Yeo, and the first houses were built in 1966 with construction continuing 
through 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Houses in this quiet residential area are modest, and lawns are well-tended. At 
times the landscaping -- including cactus, small palms, willow trees and 
flowers such as roses, marigolds and Vinca -- is showier than the houses it 
fronts. As Fir Avenue intersects Wisteria Street, the variety of evergreens in 
evidence -- pines, Douglas firs and cedars -- gives credence to the avenue's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
City Council member and schoolteacher Frank Laszlo, one of the original 
residents of the neighborhood, has lived there for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very nice area . . . an affluent area, (whose residents are) doctors, 
airline pilots, dentists, businessmen, attorneys, teachers," Laszlo says. 
Laszlo's observations are backed by economic data. The neighborhood has a 
median household income in excess of $65,000, high even by Orange County 
standards. Three households in four have an annual income of $50,000 or more. 
"It's a desirable location, very close to the freeway, close to Los Angeles, a 
couple of miles from the beach," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, about 50% of the residents drove to Los Angeles to work; now the 
number of commuters is down to 40%. Some residents have jobs in Long Beach, and 
others "are beginning to go to Orange County (to work) -- and complain about 
traffic," Laszlo says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good area to raise a family," he continues. "The school system, Los 
Alamitos, is one of the best in the county. A lot of families have moved in 
(recently) with a lot of kids." He's surprised that young families can afford 
the current house prices. 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices here are an echo of the rest of the county. A three-bedroom 
house originally sold for $27,000. Homes with three to six bedrooms now fetch 
$300,000 to $500,000 and up. A four-bedroom home that cost $32,000 20 years ago 
would now sell for more than $350,000. A two-story structure that originally 
sold for $36,000 is now worth more than $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
Children cavort at the small playground at Shapell Park, on the corner of 
Almond Avenue and Oleander Street. The children's play site at Heather Park, on 
Hazelnut Avenue between Heather and Iris streets, features such amenities as 
tennis courts, a children's tree house and a softball field. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood's proximity to the Armed Forces Reserve Center has posed no 
problems, Laszlo says. "Helicopters do fly outside the area, but citizens are 
used to it and have no complaints. . . . The majority coexist with the air 
station fairly well." 
</P>
<P>
A focal point of physical and social activity, the Old Ranch Golf Country Club 
and Tennis Club, lies west of the residential community proper. And the name is 
no exercise in needless conceit, for it actually comprises two exclusive 
private clubs, one for golf and one for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
To join, one must be sponsored by a member and be seconded by another. The 
initiation fee for a golf membership is $20,000; monthly dues are $200. Even at 
those rates, there is a waiting list. "The majority of the members come from 
Long Beach, Seal Beach and Huntington Beach," says Bill Elvins, manager of the 
golf club. 
</P>
<P>
It is not mandatory that a prospective member have a sponsor to join the tennis 
club, according to manager Bob Litrich. The initiation fee is $600; monthly 
fees vary from $85 to $100 depending on the type of membership. Some members 
belong to both clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Social memberships, when they are available (they are currently sold out), 
feature the use of the clubhouse, food and beverages, and club social events. 
The initiation fee and monthly dues are a more modest $125 and $65, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has its share of individually owned condominiums between Old 
Ranch Road and Lampson Avenue. Prices for condominiums were sometimes higher 
than the price for houses: When houses were selling for $280,000, condominiums 
were on the market for $285,000 to $290,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than the condos' prices were controversial. Their construction stirred 
trouble between residents of College Park East and developers. "Citizens wanted 
the area to be a park site," Laszlo says. "The city government didn't quite 
understand our position, and (we) took the vote to the people," but their 
efforts to block the construction failed. 
</P>
<P>
The misunderstanding is perhaps understandable with a look at a map. The San 
Diego Freeway divides the neighborhood from the bulk of the city, giving it a 
bit of a separatist mentality. 
</P>
<P>
"College Park East is a little bit more politically aggressive (than the rest 
of Seal Beach) at times. It's north of the freeway. We hope to get along a 
little bit better" in the future, Laszlo says.

2 COUNTY MEN GUILTY IN TAX FRAUD AT B-1 SUBCONTRACTORS FOR ROCKWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Southern California men -- including two Orange County residents -- have 
pleaded guilty to charges that they set up a tax fraud involving phony 
invoices. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud was carried out at two Montebello companies -- Super K and J.K. 
Precision Machining Inc. -- that were subcontractors to Rockwell International 
on the B-1 in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The companies' owner -- Joseph Kasparoff, 55, of Encino -- wrote company checks 
based on bogus invoices to two Orange County residents. Kasparoff deducted the 
payments as business expenses on his taxes, even though the men returned the 
money to him. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government paid the two companies hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, based on many of the phony invoices. 
</P>
<P>
"They stole the money from the government through defense fraud, then laundered 
the money out of the company into their own pockets, and then evaded taxes on 
that money," Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Geyer, 71, of Brea pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy and two counts 
of tax evasion for writing the phony invoices and failing to file tax returns 
or pay taxes for three years. Geyer worked as a messenger for Kasparoff's 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Calta, 40, of Orange pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy for cashing 
about $1 million in checks made out to fictitious third parties, then returning 
the money to Kasparoff. Calta was a business acquaintance of Kasparoff. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparoff pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy, tax evasion and knowingly 
filing a false tax return. He faces up to 13 years in prison and $750,000 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer could be sentenced up to 15 years in jail and fined $750,000. Both are 
scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Calta is expected to be sentenced Dec. 11 and could receive a five-year prison 
sentence and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Kasparoff and Geyer were convicted on charges of conspiracy, false 
claims and false statements in connection with defrauding the B-1 program. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier scheme was carried out in part through bogus invoices prepared by 
Geyer, Madison said. Calta was not charged in that case.

GRADCO TO MAKE BUYOUT PLAN ANNOUNCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gradco Inc. said it will make an announcement by Monday regarding a proposal by 
company management to purchase the Irvine office equipment maker in a leveraged 
buyout, which an analyst speculated would be financed by Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
In late September, Gradco founder and chairman Keith B. Stewart said he was 
considering buying the company, the world's largest supplier of collating and 
sorting equipment for office copiers. At that time, Stewart, who controls 12% 
of Gradco's stock, said he had not made a formal proposal to the firm's board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Newton H. Lee, Gradco's corporate secretary, said that because of recent 
heavier-than-normal trading activity in Gradco stock, "there will be some sort 
of release made by Monday." He declined to elaborate on the nature of the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco stock, which is traded over the counter, has climbed higher in 
moderately heavy trading the past two days. It closed Wednesday at $18.25 a 
share, up 50 cents, with 273,500 shares changing hands, about double the 
company's average daily volume. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles investment analyst speculated that the Gradco buyout plan may 
involve a Japanese bank or investment consortium that would help finance the 
purchase of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Donna M. Hostetler, director of research at Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los 
Angeles, said that many of Gradco's biggest customers are Japanese companies 
and the Irvine firm previously has said it wanted to sell part of its Gradco 
Japan Ltd. subsidiary in a Japanese public offering. The subsidiary accounted 
for roughly one-third of Gradco's sales of $115 million in the 1989 fiscal year 
ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scenario would be that a Japanese bank or consortium would do the buyout, 
and then Gradco would go public in Japan," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the company "was not in a position to comment" on speculation about 
Japanese involvement in the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco has ties to nearly all of Japan's leading copier manufacturers, such as 
Canon, C. Itoh, Fuji, Ricoh and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
At current prices, Gradco's 6.3 million shares outstanding would have a value 
of about $115 million. Not counting Stewart's stake, the remaining 88% of the 
company would be valued at about $101 million. Gradco went public in June, 
1983, at $18 per share. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, two of Gradco's largest U.S. stockholders have reduced their 
stake in the company. From July to September, Dalfort Corp., a Dallas aircraft 
firm controlled by the Chicago-based Pritzker family investment group, sold 
171,500 shares of Gradco stock, reducing its stake in the firm to 288,200 
shares, or 4.5%. In October, Insurance &amp; Annuity Teachers of New York sold 
all its 270,000 shares of Gradco stock.

ANAHEIM BANKER ASSAILS PROPOSED LAW ON MONEY LAUNDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim banker L. Don Sargent joined other bankers at a U.S. Senate hearing 
Wednesday in denouncing pending legislation that would force bankers in certain 
areas, including Southern California, to adhere to stricter guidelines for 
reporting suspected money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent, president and chief executive of American Commerce National Bank, told 
a subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee that current money-laundering 
rules strike a "crushing blow to a small bank attempting to serve its customers 
in an efficient manner while maintaining an acceptable level of profit." 
</P>
<P>
The Bank Secrecy Act's money-laundering provisions, aimed at ferreting out 
suspected drug and organized crime figures, require banks to report to the U.S. 
Treasury any daily cash deposits or withdrawals of $10,000 or more by 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The pending bill would require bankers in certain areas -- those where federal 
investigators say organized crime groups concentrate operations -- to report 
transactions of $5,000 or more and to report "suspicious" transactions of any 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Each report takes 18 to 26 minutes to fill out and review, Sargent said in 
prepared remarks. He said his bank expects to file 1,500 such reports by the 
end of the year, requiring a minimum of 450 hours of work, and many small banks 
file two or three times more reports. 
</P>
<P>
Of 5,300 reports filed over the past two years by Sargent's former employer, 
Mechanics Bank in Paramount, only two cases appeared particularly suspicious, 
he said, and federal agents "took little action," failing even to ask for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, our experience in the Los Angeles Basin tends to suggest that 
even though banks have steadily increased their efforts to comply with the Bank 
Secrecy Act, both their regulatory burden and the drug epidemic continue to 
spread at an alarming rate." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Orange County, La Habra banker Craig Collette complained that Congress 
is trying to make banks responsible for money-laundering activities of others. 
"We don't want to be the police force," said Collette, president of Landmark 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisition OKd: The old Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa came a step closer 
Wednesday to becoming part of a super-regional consumer banking firm as 
shareholders of a Seattle savings and loan firm agreed to be acquired by 
Pacific Savings' new owner, Royal Trustco Ltd. in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The $212-million purchase of Pacific First Financial Corp. now needs only 
regulatory approval, which Royal Trust executives said they expect to receive 
by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Savings, called Pacific First Bank since Royal Trust bought it on Oct. 
13 from federal regulators, will then be merged into Pacific First Financial. 
But that's mainly a legal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Employees and customers of the Costa Mesa institution may never know exactly 
when that merger will occur, said Jerry E. Pohlman, Pacific First Financial's 
president and chief executive, because the Seattle firm already is managing the 
S&amp;L and is beginning to offer Southern California customers the same 
products that its savings associations offer in Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trust is concentrating on expanding Pacific First operations in 
California through internal growth and through acquisitions of other 
institutions and branches of other institutions, said Michael A. Cornelissen, 
Royal Trust's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for regulators, who are strapped with ailing and failing 
institutions. Regulators have been looking past U.S. borders to find cash-rich 
companies interested in owning a thrift here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans to grow to a super-regional consumer bank are there because of the 
fragmented nature of the (U.S.) industry today because of the crying need for 
capital and because we know there are a large number of smaller franchises that 
are for sale," Cornelissen said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trust, which tripled its size in about five years without acquiring other 
companies, wants to turn the three-state Pacific First operation into a 
$20-billion asset bank from its current $7-billion size in the next three or 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Savings is not big enough to give us the economies of scale we need, 
so we're looking for expansion in Southern California," Pohlman said. But if a 
good deal comes along to complement its lone branch office in Walnut Creek, the 
company will expand first in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest opportunity is through acquisition."

CHRYSLER MARKETER RECRUITED TO AID MAZDA'S U.S. IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As part of a campaign to improve its image in the United States, Mazda Motor of 
America said Wednesday that it has hired Chrysler's marketing manager to be 
senior vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Clark J. Vitulli, 43, has spent the last 20 years with Chrysler Corp. in varied 
sales and marketing positions. He was California regional sales manager when he 
was chosen in September, 1987, to head national marketing and advertising for 
Chrysler vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America -- whose headquarters is in 
Irvine -- said that Vitulli was hired to bring in "a fresh outside perspective" 
and that Mazda is especially interested in Vitulli's experience in marketing 
Chrysler's luxury line. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Mazda appointed a panel to study establishing a separate luxury 
brand in the United States, as Nissan, Toyota and Honda have done with their 
Infiniti, Lexus and Acura lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler marque has not been the star of Chrysler Corp.'s stable; that has 
been the Jeeps and minivans of the company's Plymouth and Dodge divisions. But 
industry analysts said Vitulli did a good job with the product he was given. 
</P>
<P>
"Chrysler has struggled in the upper end of the market against General Motors' 
Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln and Lincoln Town Car . . . without changing its 
product often enough," said Arvid Jouppi, automotive analyst for Keane 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Jouppi said Vitulli "has a good reputation but is just not part of the 
(Chrysler Chairman) Lee Iacocca inner circle." 
</P>
<P>
As senior vice president and general manager, Vitulli will become the senior 
American official at Mazda. The position has existed in Mazda's management 
charts since the Japanese auto maker formed its U.S. subsidiary 16 months ago, 
but this is the first time that it has been filled. 
</P>
<P>
Vitulli, who could not be reached for comment, starts work Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda recently began a five-year campaign to build name recognition and upgrade 
its image among U.S. consumers by emphasizing the quality of its product rather 
than its price. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda, which boosted its U.S. ad budget to more than $200 million from last 
year's $150 million, ranks fourth among the Japanese auto makers and is not 
nearly as well known as Nissan, Toyota and Honda, company spokesman Al Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tremendous success of the new Miata sports car has failed to give the 
Mazda name a big push among consumers. George McCabe, recently promoted to vice 
president of Mazda Motor America's newly formed operations group, presided 
earlier this year over the introduction of the Miata. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows Miata, but a lot of people don't put Mazda together with it," 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster its image and name identification, Mazda needs a major marketing 
push, which is Vitulli's forte. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has done little to build any kind of an image until this year," 
said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, a Los Angeles-based automotive 
ad research firm. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the Japanese companies seem to be chasing the Germans, and it looks 
like they all will be clustering in that luxury-car niche," he said.

POP BEAT: O'JAY FOUNDER EMBRACES GENERATION GAP; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: EDDIE LEVERT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL OF EVERYTHING HE HEARS HIS 
SONS' BAND PERFORM ON THEIR JOINT TOUR, WHICH INCLUDES ANAHEIM STOPS, BUT HE 
KNOWS SUCCESS WHEN HE HEARS IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One of the most potent songs on the current hit O'Jays album, "Serious," is 
"Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black," in which the veteran R&amp;B trio addresses 
parents who criticize their children's music and ways, taking them to task with 
the same vocal vigor they used to apply to back-stabbers and money-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Founding O'Jay Eddie Levert said the song's message is one the band has taken 
to heart, and it's a good thing too: The group has been spending the better 
part of this year touring with LeVert, the young multiplatinum-selling group 
that includes two of Levert's sons, Gerald, 23, and Sean, 24. The two groups 
appear at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre tonight and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Reached on tour Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., the 47-year-old singer 
acknowledged that he finds some of the music favored by younger radio 
programmers to be "ludicrous" and that his sons say there are qualities to some 
current music that he just cannot hear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just calling it as I see it, no more than that, and who am I to judge?" 
Levert said with a laugh. "We have to take 'Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black' to 
heart. You have to accept the things you can't change, and I continually hear 
these things on the radio, and people keep going to the store to buy them, so I 
can't fret about it just because I didn't hear it. Who knows everything?" 
</P>
<P>
For the "Serious" album, Levert and fellow O'Jays Walter Williams and Sammy 
Strain brought in the "fresh, funky attitude" of Gerald and third LeVert member 
Marc Gordon to produce four tracks. Among those are the rap-inclusive hit, 
"Have You Had Your Love Today?" which put the O'Jays solidly back on the charts 
after a long fallow period broken only by "Lovin' You" in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since the group LeVert debuted with "Bloodline" in 1986, it has racked up nine 
Top 10 R&amp;B hits, five of which have gone to No. 1. That success has 
somewhat assuaged the elder Levert's reservations about his sons entering show 
biz (his other son, Ed Jr., is a tour manager for LeVert). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't discourage them, but I really wanted them to go to college, learn a 
craft, and then, if they wanted to do music and it happened for them, great, 
but they would already have a craft that would generate a living. But they 
didn't want to hear that; they wanted to be in show business." 
</P>
<P>
Having seen firsthand the ups, downs and pitfalls of the musician's life since 
he embarked on it in 1958, Levert worried about his children following in his 
footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"I still worry, even now," he said, "But all you can do is basically give them 
the right principles and morals, and then the rest is on them." 
</P>
<P>
His advice? "Never be a follower. Never let other people lead you. Try to be a 
good judge of other people, and try to judge people how you would want people 
to look at you. And to remember that it's not all just about you: It's about 
your mom, your dad, sister, brother, cousin and everybody that knows you and 
cares for you. What happens to you affects them too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you go out with that kind of consciousness about you, you give 
things a second thought before you dive into stuff. I'd have to give their mom 
a lot of credit for raising them right. She really was the spiritual leader of 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
Where many parents and offspring have seen quite enough of each other for a 
while by the time the kids are out of school, Levert said touring with his sons 
has been no problem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is somewhat of a dream for us, to be performing together and to be doing 
well at it. We know we're in business together, and the object is to do the 
show. Plus we give each other a lot of room. Like today, they're in the same 
hotel, but I might not see them at all until we leave tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Levert enjoys his sons' music, as well as the work of producers Jimmy Jam and 
Terry Lewis, Bobby Brown and Michael Jackson. "But you've got to remember, I'm 
from the old school," he added. "I'm used to seeing Otis Redding, James Brown 
and Jackie Wilson in their prime. I had some of my most memorable nights just 
watching those guys from the wings. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I learned how to do a show, and that it comes down to you, the 
microphone and the spotlight. That's when the crowd learns to appreciate you 
and know that you're a legitimate talent." 
</P>
<P>
Two decades after those giants' heyday, the O'Jays are still known to tear up a 
stage. Levert said the shows stay fresh for him because "I still like to 
compete. Above and beyond what everybody says, it still is a very competitive 
business. They all want to have the No. 1 record -- and to have it be No. 1 the 
longest. They all want to be the one to stop the show. And we do too." 
</P>
<P>
Does that rivalry apply on the tour with LeVert? "Naturally. They know that 
we've got a reputation of being very energetic performers -- though I don't 
know how high the energy, or the kicks, are now that we're older -- but we 
still get it up enough to know that we have to at least finesse our way 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough records and enough fans that it matches them pretty well. So 
we're both trying out there, in a friendly way." 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Jays and LeVert play tonight at 7:30 p.m. and Friday at 7:30 and 10 p.m. 
at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $20. Friday's 
shows are sold out. Information: (714) 999-9536.

RESTAURATEURS TWICE-CHALLENGED TO HELP THE NEEDY

Orange County restaurants were given two challenges this week to help the 
needy. One was from Rex Chandler, owner of Rex Restaurant and the Oyster Bar 
&amp; Grill in Newport Beach. A five-year board member of the county's American 
Red Cross chapter, Chandler has asked fellow restaurateurs to designate 
Saturday as "Nov. 4 for the Red Cross" and to donate 10% of the day's receipts 
to the Red Cross disaster fund. 
</P>
<P>
The fund, Chandler said, has been seriously depleted by Red Cross services to 
Bay Area residents after the Northern California earthquake and to victims of 
Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to participate may contact Chandler at (714) 675-2566.

The second challenge came from Jean Forbath, director of Save Our Selves in 
Costa Mesa, a nonprofit, all-volunteer agency that responds to the emergency 
needs of the county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
SOS has "a tremendous need" for prepared food for the homeless, Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
County restaurants, caterers and food services already donate excess foods to 
SOS, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, more food is needed, all year long. 
</P>
<P>
Some catering trucks bring food in to SOS at day's end. Other contributors 
include the test kitchens at Grace Restaurant Service in Irvine and 
Showley-Wrightson in Newport Beach. And some restaurants, according to grateful 
SOS personnel, "just bring food by, without identifying themselves." 
</P>
<P>
SOS is at 661 Hamilton St., Costa Mesa. For information, call (714) 642-3451.

'SHENANDOAH' DOES AN OVERKILL IN POIGNANCY

<P>
"Shenandoah" is as homespun as you can get, all about family and the land and 
patriotism and lovin' and fightin' and more lovin' and more fightin'. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the rousing, sentimental 1965 movie starring James Stewart, this 
musical strives to create a frontier world steeped in simple values and 
virtues. 
</P>
<P>
If you fall for the brawny and ever-proud Anderson clan, "Shenandoah" might be 
a spirited, moving ride. But you have to accept an awful lot -- the telling of 
the Andersons and their struggle for independence during the Civil War is 
steeped in thick syrup. 
</P>
<P>
You can feel manipulated, even when patriarch Charlie Anderson is singing his 
flannel-covered heart out about the troubles he's seen. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, Director Jan Duncan goes for poignancy at every opportunity, and 
the Fullerton Civic Light Opera production of the Gary Geld-Peter Udell-James 
Lee Barrett show is an emotional ramble down a rough road. She tries to 
overcome the musical's inherent problems, but only succeeds part of the time. 
</P>
<P>
That usually comes when Stan Throneberry is having at it as Charlie Anderson. 
His performance is not the kind that can steer a listing vehicle into 
comfortable waters, but it is good enough for us to accept most of the 
heavy-handedness that keeps coming down. 
</P>
<P>
He makes Charlie a sympathetic character who, when he refuses to join the 
Confederate Army on moral grounds, becomes heroic in his steadfast idealism. 
When Charlie finally must get involved, after his youngest son is taken by 
Union soldiers, it's a love of family, not the South or slavery, that moves 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie's sons (Jim Wall, Greg Jackson, Ron Samson, Barry Ramsey, Tim Shipman 
and Christian Hoff) are a rambunctious lot, quick to get cranky and make fists, 
but even quicker to mellow out and be good boys. Their sister (Lisa Sundstedt) 
is as spunky as any of them. The performers move reasonably well through the 
melodramatic score and comfortably handle Sha Newman's hillbilly-acrobatic 
choreography. 
</P>

1990 L.A. FESTIVAL HOPES TO ATTRACT ORANGE COUNTY ARTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: THE CURATED SESSIONS AND THE "OPEN" EVENTS WILL LOOK SOUTH IN SEEKING 
PARTICIPANTS TO THIS 1984 OLYMPICS SEQUEL.

<P>
Planners of the 1990 Los Angeles Festival intend to present arts and artists 
from as far away as Australia, Korea and Colombia. The City of the Angels is to 
be represented too. But will any limelight shine on Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the festival hope so. Any Orange County artists and arts groups 
-- practicing any media -- may take part in the event's Open Festival, in which 
participants will pay their own production costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Festival, planned for Sept. 1 through 17, is expected to 
include about 1,500 dancers, visual artists, musicians, actors and more. The 
festival will be a sequel to the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival, which recognized 
the vitality of Los Angeles on the worldwide cultural landscape. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting on how to get involved is scheduled for 7 o'clock tonight at the 
Warner Grand Theater, 478 W. 6th St., San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely interested in having Orange County artists take part in the 
Open Festival," said its coordinator, Aaron Paley. 
</P>
<P>
While no one locally has been invited yet, Orange County artists may also 
appear in the festival's curated component (still being organized), where 
artists are paid to present their work, according to L.A. Festival executive 
director Judith Luther. 
</P>
<P>
The overall festival's chief focus will be on cultures "touched by the Pacific 
Ocean," such as those in Southeast Asia, South and Central America, Canada, 
Siberia, Japan, Mexico, the Pacific Islands and Australia, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With this county's large Southeast Asian population, "I'd be surprised if some 
of those artists (of Southeast Asian origin) were not pulled out of Orange 
County," Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
While Open Festival artists -- whose work need not fit the Pacific-oriented 
theme -- must pay their own way, they will be offered a range of other 
services, said Paley, who directed the 1987 Fringe Festival, also a pay-to-play 
event devoted to smaller, local groups that coincided with the 1987 L.A. 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
One such service, he said, is that all 1990 L.A. Festival events -- "open" or 
otherwise -- will be listed for free in a single schedule of activities. "Open" 
participants will also be offered workshops on self-production and receive a 
free guide on self-producing in Los Angeles County, where all festival events 
will probably occur. And organizers will help participants find venues to 
present their work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to network with artists, to put them in touch with other artists 
they might collaborate with," Paley said. "For instance, if the dance community 
in L.A. is doing a series of dance concerts, we would put them in touch with an 
Orange County dancer or troupe." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting will address such possibilities, Paley said: "We would like 
to talk to artists in Orange County to find out what their needs are." 
</P>
<P>
Those who cannot attend tonight's meeting may call (213) 315-9444 or (213) 
689-8800 for an Open Festival application or other information. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 people attended the 1987 Los Angeles Festival and the Fringe, 
Paley said. While many of the 500 participants in the Fringe Festival (which 
included at least five Orange County groups) said they would do it again, many 
lost money, he reported at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope to minimize that risk for the Open Festival by helping artists 
to find venues with less expensive rents (several performances will take place 
in parks and other outdoor sites with no admission charge, organizers have 
said), and by omitting a Fringe Festival application fee (the previous minimum 
was $100). 
</P>
<P>
Participation in the "Open Festival" will offer artists significant benefits, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important is the contact they'll have with other artists, 
particularly those from countries around the world," Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be extremely meaningful, for instance, for Cambodian artists in 
Southern California to have contact with Cambodian dancers from Phnom Penh," 
members of a troupe that festival planners are hoping to present. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Orange County artists and arts groups may attend a free meeting tonight to find 
out how to take part in the Open Festival of the 1990 Los Angeles Festival. 
Open Festival participants pay their own productions costs. The 7 p.m. meeting 
with festival director Peter Sellars will be held at Warner Grand Theater, 478 
W. 6th St., San Pedro. Information: (213) 315-9444.

Drug crimes -- A story in the Oct. 29 South Bay edition of The Times about drug 
dealing in Harbor City incorrectly identified Hector DuBon as assistant 
principal of Normont Elementary School and quoted DuBon about gang shootings 
and other crimes. DuBon is assistant principal of another elementary school, 
elsewhere in Los Angeles, and the remarks he made do not apply to Normont 
Elementary. Rosalie Cochran, principal at Normont, said there have been no gang 
shootings on or near school property, and that her biggest crime concern is 
that students must sometimes walk to and from campus on streets where drug 
dealers operate.

JERRY BUSS' DAUGHTER ROBBED OF $25,000 IN JEWELRY AT THE FORUM

A gunman confronted the daughter of Jerry Buss inside her father's Great 
Western Forum sports arena and robbed her of $25,000 in jewels, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanie Buss, 28, director of tennis and volleyball for her father's California 
Sports Inc., was in the north stairwell on her way to her Inglewood Forum 
office when the gunman approached Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"She was shaken up. This is the first such burglary that has occurred on our 
premises," said Bob Steiner, spokesman for the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The items stolen included a Los Angeles Laker's championship ring, a Rolex 
watch, a diamond tennis bracelet and her engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
According to Forum officials, the suspect was 18 to 20 years old, about 5 feet 
10 inches and was wearing green pants and a white T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery appeared to have been planned, Steiner said, because at the time a 
guard was between posts while walking his rounds. There were no sports events 
going on in the Forum, which hosts Lakers basketball and Los Angeles Kings 
hockey games.

East Germany fired the wife of former leader Erich Honecker as education 
minister today and four other senior politicians resigned, including the 
leaders of two political parties allied to the ruling Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The moves pointed to an accelerating clear-out of politicians associated with 
the Honecker era and came as his successor, Egon Krenz, was on a one-day visit 
to Warsaw for talks with the reformist Solidarity-led government. 
</P>
<P>
Margot Honecker, 62, had run the Education Ministry since 1963. Her husband had 
ruled East Germany from 1971 until Oct. 18, when he was dismissed as Communist 
Party leader for failing to satisfy mass aspirations for political reform.

<P>
A family escaped unharmed from their home in Santa Clarita this morning as 
flames swept through it, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the home in the 24600 block of Arcadia Street was reported at 1:20 
a.m., dispatcher Stan Pearson said. Four members of a family living in the home 
were awakened and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Morris said she was awakened by an explosion, possibly from an oxygen 
bottle that was stored in the garage. She woke her husband, Don, and two 
teen-age sons, including one whose leg was in a cast, and fled from the 
smoke-filled home. She said she burned her feet running across hot embers that 
had fallen in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $120,000 damage and took firefighters about 15 
minutes to extinguish. Cause of the blaze is under investigation, Pearson said.

Troops loyal to the leftist Sandinista government attacked U.S.-backed Contra 
guerrillas just hours after President Daniel Ortega ended a 19-month truce, a 
military spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
But the spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rosa Pazos, denied that any large-scale 
operations were involved, and said most of the action was concentrated on 
rebels sneaking into Nicaragua from neighboring Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
"These are military operations against mercenary forces that have been 
infiltrating," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Pazos said most of the action is concentrated in the regions where the bulk of 
an estimated 2,500 Contras are scattered. 
</P>
<P>
Pazos also confirmed a report by the Sandinista National Liberation Front 
newspaper Barricada that an army company backed by militias mounted the first 
attack against a group of about 30 Contras in the area around Quilali. 
</P>
<P>
She said the attack took place Wednesday, about two hours after Ortega 
announced he would not renew the cease-fire, but refused to pinpoint the area. 
She said she did not have immediate reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House said today it is unrealistic to expect the 
Contras to lay down their arms when the leftist Sandinista government is out 
"to destroy them" by breaking the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States still backs the 
regional peace accord that calls for the Contras to voluntarily disband by Dec. 
5 and return to their homeland if they so desire. But he also indicated that 
this support made conditional by President Ortega's decision to restart the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ask people to repatriate themselves into a climate where they're 
threatened with death," the spokesman told reporters. "I don't think anybody 
expects demobilization to proceed as long as the Sandinistas are on the 
offensive attack to try to destroy them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile today, the House adopted, 379 to 29, a Senate-passed resolution that 
condemned Ortega for canceling the cease-fire and opposed any effort to cancel 
or delay national elections scheduled for next Feb. 25.

A former nursing home aide was sentenced to life in prison without parole today 
for smothering five patients in a pact with her lesbian lover. 
</P>
<P>
Gwendolyn Graham, 26, was convicted Sept. 20 of five counts of murder and one 
of conspiracy for killing severely incapacitated patients at the Alpine Manor 
Nursing Home in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's former co-worker and lover, Catherine Wood, was sentenced last month 
to 20 to 40 years in prison for her part in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, the prosecution's key witness, testified that the murders were part of a 
pact the two hoped would bind their love. She said Graham told her the killings 
helped her "relieve tension."

China, facing a severe brain drain, announced financial incentives today to woo 
back thousands of college graduates overseas who refused to return after 
soldiers crushed the student-led democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Jialin of the Ministry of Personnel, which oversees employment, said new 
regulations are expected to aid and subsidize scientific and technological 
activities of returnees involved in research. 
</P>
<P>
Preference will be shown to the newly returned who are "promising, young and 
have a low academic position" and could not normally expect to get funds from 
other channels, New China News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first detailed announcement of a program aimed at luring back 
students since the crackdown on pro-demoncracy demonstrators June 3 and 4. Many 
Western nations have allowed Chinese students fearful of returning to remain 
beyond the expiration of their visas. 
</P>
<P>
A July poll conducted by Chinese students at Harvard University showed that 
only 1% of the 50,000 Chinese studying in the United States planned to return 
to China. Nearly 58% said that before the Beijing crackdown they had intended 
to return to what they perceived as a rapidly liberalizing China.

Rudolf Nureyev will meet the head of the Paris Opera Ballet later this month, 
raising hopes that the dancer-director's contract dispute with the company 
might eventually be settled, an opera spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Soviet defector, who is insisting on new terms, agreed to meet 
French Opera Chairman Pierre Berge at the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev has directed the ballet since 1983. But his relations with the Paris 
Opera Ballet reached an all-time low last month when the company began its new 
season with temporary replacements for its temperamental star, who had refused 
to return from the United States.

A Soviet submarine became ensnared in the net of a Norwegian fishing trawler 
today but was freed when a stormy sea tore open the net, a defense official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Stig Morten Karlsen of the Norwegian Supreme Defense Command said 
neither vessel had been in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Darkness and the storm in the Barents Sea made it impossible for the crews to 
go on deck to free the 2,000-ton conventional submarine, and the crews had 
expected to spend a rough night entangled together. 
</P>
<P>
But the force of the storm did the job for them, tearing the fishing net to 
pieces under the weight of the submarine. Neither ship suffered serious damage.

Wang Laboratories Inc., which recently ousted the founder's son as the 
company's president, plans to lay off another 2,500 employees, or 10% of the 
work force, a published report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Globe, citing a source close to the computer manufacturer, said the 
cuts, which Wang plans to announce next week, are part of a restructuring under 
new President Richard W. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Wang, which had losses of nearly $425 million in the fiscal 
year that ended June 30, declined to confirm or deny the reported layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Miller came to Wang in August, replacing former President Frederick Wang, the 
son of company founder and Chairman An Wang.

Workers at Chrysler's No. 2 plant have rejected a contract proposal that would 
have set up a four-day workweek and allowed the hiring of up to 1,000 new 
employees, a union spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the voting Wednesday by members of United Auto Workers Local 110 
were 2,340 against and 300 in favor of the proposed pact, the spokeswoman said. 
She said local officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials had said they expected workers at the mini-van plant to approve 
the proposal, which called for employees to work 10 hours a day during the 
four-day week. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives had said the move would boost output of the nation's most 
popular mini-van to 50,000 vehicles a year without having to construct a new 
plant. The mini-van is Chrysler's most popular vehicle.

Integrated Resources Inc. today agreed to sell its key businesses to a Los 
Angeles financial services concern for up to $225 million, but the deal faces 
opposition from state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Broad Inc., whose $7 billion in assets include the SunAmerica 
insurance groups, is subject to price adjustments at the time of closing. The 
deal would be worth $170 million if completed today. 
</P>
<P>
The sale would cap Integrated's months of attempts to sell its core businesses 
to raise money to help meet payments on about $1.75 billion in debt and avoid a 
bankruptcy court filing. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated said insurance commissioners in Iowa and Colorado had placed under 
supervision two of the struggling firm's life insurance companies, Integrated 
Life Insurance Co. and Capitol Life Insurance Co., included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is far below the $450 million Integrated had hoped to obtain several 
months ago for its core financial businesses.

TOP RETAILERS REPORT MIXED OCTOBER SALES; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: CLOTHING STORES DID RELATIVELY WELL. BIG-TICKET ITEMS SOLD POORLY 
DURING THE MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The country's big retailers today reported mixed October sales, with results at 
some general merchandise stores hurt by consumers' reluctance to spend freely 
on expensive goods, such as furniture or home appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing retailers fared better than major national chains that depend heavily 
on sales of big-ticket durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, however, unseasonably 
mild weather discouraged shopping for winter apparel. 
</P>
<P>
"They were generally modest kinds of sales gains that continued the basic trend 
of the past several months," said analyst Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck and Co., the largest U.S. retailer, said its sales edged up 0.7% 
in the four weeks ended Oct. 28 to $2.53 billion from $2.51 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But sales at Sears stores open at least a year, called same-store or 
comparable-store sales, were flat. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better reflection of a 
company's performance than tallies that include the take at newly opened 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Feiner said results for some of the retailers looked slightly worse than they 
were because they were being compared to sales during a strong month last year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was difficult to generalize about last month's retailing 
business because the results varied so widely. Economists track retailers' 
results closely for clues about spending patterns. Consumer spending accounts 
for about two-thirds of total U.S. economic output. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers were really mixed, more so than we've seen in previous months," 
said retail analyst Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Within the apparel category alone there were variations. Moderate to 
higher-priced clothing merchants posted fairly strong results while apparel 
sales at discounters lagged, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of retailers reporting: 
</P>
<P>
 -- K mart Corp., the second-largest retailer, said its October sales increased 
5.3% to $2.07 billion from $1.97 billion in October, 1988. Its comparable-store 
sales were up 2.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 22% increase in October sales 
to $2.19 billion from $1.79 billion. Wal-Mart's same-stores sales grew 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J. C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a 9.6% October sales gain to $1.28 billion 
from $1.17 billion. Penney's same-store sales rose 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dayton Hudson Corp. reported October sales went up 16.2% to $969 million 
from $834 million. Its same-store sales rose 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, said its sales rose 9% 
to $334.9 million from $307.7 million. On a comparable-store basis, Limited's 
sales were up 6%.

Oakland Athletics right fielder Jose Canseco was briefly detained by police at 
McCarran International Airport after reportedly causing a disturbance on a 
flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Police took Canseco aside after he got off the flight late Tuesday night and 
questioned him for about 20 minutes before letting him go, said Metropolitan 
Police Lt. Ron Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the pilot had radioed ahead and alerted police that Canseco was 
being unruly with a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he didn't do some of the things she told him to do, like putting on 
his seat belt," he said. "The flight attendant told the officers she had 
interpreted some of the things he had said back to her as threats. His side was 
that the flight crew was lying about the accusations." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher called the incident no big deal and said police stationed at the airport 
commonly respond to similar incidents.

Curtis Strange had the day's best score, but the U.S. and European teams 
finished in a tie with 6 points apiece today in the $1.03-million Four Tours 
World Championship of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
Strange scored a pair of eagles and three birdies en route to a bogey-free 65 
and beat Mark James of the European Tour, who had a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green beat Ian Woosnam, 70-73, and British Open Champ Mark Calcavecchia 
edged Jose-Maria Olazabal, 72-73. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans collected six points after Bernhard Langer beat PGA winner Payne 
Stewart, 70-73; Gordon Brand Jr. beat Chip Beck, 68-69; and Ronan Rafferty beat 
Tom Kite, the PGA's leading money-winner, 69-70, on the hilly 7,071-yard Tokyo 
Yomiuri Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
"I played well today, especially putting," Strange said. "I am trying my best 
all the time. In such team competition, I just beat my opponent but in the 
individual competition I must have the best score." 
</P>
<P>
A victory is worth 2 points and a draw worth 1 in the team competition among 
four golf tours from the United States, Europe, Australia-New Zealand and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Australia-New Zealand team, led by Greg Norman, beat Japan, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
After the first round Australia-New Zealand led with 8 points, followed by the 
Americans and Europeans with 6 each and Japan with 4. 
</P>
<P>
"We played not aggressively but conservatively in the gusty winds," said 
Norman, the captain of Australia-New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The United States meets Australia-New Zealand and Japan plays Europe on Friday 
in the round-robin tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After the three rounds, the two top teams will face off in the final match 
Sunday, which will earn $390,000 for the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans have won the tournament the last two years.

Senna, who appeared close to tears a number of times during a press conference

by the International Automobile Federation on Tuesday. The federation said 
Senna had endangered other drivers on several occasions this season but 
withheld implementation of the suspension for six months. The panel also upheld 
Senna's disqualification from the Japanese Grand Prix on Oct. 22. 
</P>

Senna, 29, said he will not moderate his aggression. "I'll drive the way I have

MARQUES JOHNSON, BACK FROM INJURIES, MAKES WARRIOR LINEUP

Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson has announced that five-time All-Star 
forward Marques Johnson, after a two-year layoff, has made the team as a backup 
power forward. 
</P>
<P>
"No question he's made the team," Nelson said Wednesday as the Warriors 
prepared for tonight's NBA opener at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-7, 33-year-old Johnson suffered a back injury in the 1986-87 season when 
he was a Los Angeles Clipper and never returned to the court. Last month he 
joined the Warriors in an attempt to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Marques turned out to be a terrific pickup for us," Nelson said. "He's been 
the veteran type of guy we needed. He's really helped working with the younger 
guys, and there's no question he can still play. 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously had to earn a spot on the team, but he's done that, no question, 
and I'm very, very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, drafted out of UCLA by Nelson when he was the coach of the Milwaukee 
Bucks, will be in the power forward slot with Rod Higgins and, in December, Jim 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing his comeback, Johnson said, "It was a hard process, going through 
the soreness and the fatigue and not playing at a level where I wanted to be."

training as a non-roster player, a Reds spokesman said. In 1989, Scott batted 
.255 with three home runs and 31 runs batted in during 111 games for Denver, 
the Milwaukee Brewers' Class AAA affiliate. He played in the American League 
for Texas in 1983 and 1984 and Seattle in 1985.
