NAVY PLANS FOR DOWNTOWN S.D. HIT LEGAL SNAG 
</P>

The state attorney general's office is challenging the Navy's plans to rebuild 
its 16-acre downtown base and supply center into a huge complex of hotels and 
high-rise office buildings, saying it violates state restrictions limiting the 
land to military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The state's stand, outlined in two letters and in recent discussions with the 
Navy, brings into question the future of the Navy project, which has been 
valued at $400 million to $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials directly involved with the project were unavailable for comment 
Thursday, but public officials who have spoken with them as well as with the 
state attorney general's office say the Navy disagrees vehemently with the 
state's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The state's involvement has caught the Navy and other San Diego officials by 
surprise, because the Navy unveiled its plans four years ago, when it announced 
it would rely mainly on private financing to rebuild the old, squat and drab 
facility that runs 8 city blocks on the water's edge between Broadway and 
Market Street and Pacific Coast Highway and Harbor Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The funding plan will allow developers to build about 1,500 hotel rooms and a 
large office tower. In return, the developers will pay about 75% of the cost to 
build the Navy about 1 million square feet of office space on the site. The 
Navy wants the office space to consolidate many of its San Diego-area 
administrative functions into what has become known as the Broadway Complex. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a joint venture between the military and private developers was so 
new it took congressional approval in 1987 to pursue the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Cmdr. Doug Schamp said Thursday that, although he isn't aware of 
the state's stand, the rationale behind the joint venture "was to do the 
rebuilding without taxpayers' money. And, to do that, we had to give up land to 
let commercial development pay for Navy office spaces. After all, we got 
Congress' approval to do this." 
</P>
<P>
But the state attorney general's office says the Navy was given access to the 
state tidelands in increments by the city of San Diego and the state from 1919 
to 1940, specifically for military uses. 
</P>
<P>
"The grant to the United States limited the types of uses of this property to 
military purposes," according to a Sept. 11 letter from the attorney general's 
office to Don Nay, the head of the San Diego Unified Port District. "Commercial 
office use for non-maritime purposes would be inconsistent with the public 
trust and the grant to the Navy. Rental of the non-maritime offices would be 
inconsistent with the trust and, as a non-military use, with the grant." 
</P>
<P>
Jamee Jordan Patterson, the deputy attorney general who wrote both that letter 
and a more detailed, eight-page letter to the Navy on Oct. 4, said the state 
Legislature hasn't freed the property for the development envisioned by the 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about the (California) public not getting its fair share," she 
said in a telephone interview. "What they are doing is using California public 
finances, assets and resources . . . and that translates into California 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
By terms of the state's title, the land would revert to the state and the Port 
District if the Navy no longer uses it for military purposes. Patterson said 
that the state has no problem with a new office building for the Navy or the 
proposed Navy maritime museum and that the hotel development might pass muster 
as a recreational use allowed by the state title, but that private office space 
that isn't marine-oriented is an outright violation. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said she has had several meetings with the Navy and the Port District 
to discuss the situation and described the Navy's position as "hard-line." 
</P>
<P>
The state doesn't want to wind up in court, she said, and is instead seeking a 
settlement that provides the state and Port District with some kind of 
compensation. "We'd love to see the old buildings gone and the streets open" 
through the project to Harbor Drive, she said. "We hope we can work it out, and 
if it's not something as the Navy has proposed, then its equivalent." 
</P>
<P>
Although several lease-options are under discussion, Patterson said, the 
easiest solution involves the Legislature's taking action, either by declaring 
that the property is no longer needed by the state or by finding that the 
proposed uses are consistent with those allowed by the state's title. Those 
uses, outlined in 1850, include using state tidelands for fishing, navigation 
and maritime commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said there is nothing unusual in the state becoming involved four 
years after the first announcement of the project. She said her office analyzed 
the proposal at the request of the State Lands Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always jumping into these things, so that's not unusual," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the attorney general's concerns is whether the Port District will 
receive "adequate payment" for giving up land if the foot of Broadway is closed 
to form a public plaza, as the city has proposed, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts, who first criticized the Navy's project as being too 
massive and later championed it when the Navy reduced it by almost 40%, said 
Thursday that "the Navy's attorneys disagree with (the state) completely." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going ahead with the planning as if (the state's involvement) didn't 
happen," he said. "The most unfortunate thing that could happen is that the 
Navy would never do anything."

BAYFRONT PLAN UP TO PORT DISTRICT

The Centre City Planning Committee on Thursday approved a set of design 
principles to guide development along San Diego's downtown bayfront by imposing 
constraints on the size of buildings while attempting to preserve views and 
create a 10-acre park at the foot of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the plan's success is the San Diego Unified Port District, which 
controls about 80% of the land in question. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Thursday afternoon, the Board of Port Commissioners indicated that 
it generally supports the major elements of the plan and expects to vote on the 
matter at its Dec. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego, which appointed the Centre City Planning Committee, is 
seeking a "memorandum of understanding" with the Port District to implement the 
bayfront development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Key points of the plan, created by the Broadway Complex Coordinating Committee, 
include adoption of building setbacks to preserve views; closing Broadway to 
allow construction of a 10-acre public square on land owned by the Navy and the 
Port District; payment to the Navy for use of the land and a link between 
Balboa Park and the bay via 5th and 6th avenues. ARMANDO ACUNA

15-YEAR-OLD CHANGES PLEA TO GUILTY TO STRANGLING GIRL, 7, IN SEX ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 15-year-old Newhall boy pleaded guilty Thursday to sexually assaulting and 
killing a 7-year-old neighbor girl whose body was found stuffed behind his bed 
three days after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Cooper changed his plea from not guilty on what was to have been the 
first day of his trial in Sylmar Juvenile Court for the first-degree murder of 
Sara Nan Hodges, who was strangled last March. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt said she will ask the court to impose 
the maximum sentence when Cooper returns to court Nov. 22. The maximum penalty 
is 25 years to life in prison, but because he is a juvenile, he would be sent 
to the California Youth Authority first, where he would be held until he is 25. 
At that time, Cooper could be transfered to a prison, but Rosenblatt said that 
was unlikely because he was only 14 at the time he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, Public Defender Barbara Duey, Cooper's attorney, said she will seek an 
alternate facility for the youth. Cooper, she said, needs the type of 
psychiatric counseling unavailable in the CYA. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid's got real problems," she said, adding that Cooper has been "very 
depressed" since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
When asked in court Thursday if he understood the charges against him and the 
consequences of his guilty plea, the slender youth answered softly that he did. 
His mother, Crystal Cooper, kissed her son on the cheek before the court 
proceeding began and remained by his side as he admitted his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, then 14, moved to Newhall in February from Florida where he had been 
arrested for a string of petty thefts and burglaries, authorities said. He 
lived with his mother on Alderbrook Drive five doors away from his victim. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes went horseback riding with his blonde, blue-eyed victim, 
authorities said, and was one of the first to volunteer to help search for her 
after she was reported missing March 23. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the first person here, saying what a nice little girl Sara was and 
asking if there was anything he could do to help," said Sara's 16-year-old 
sister, Tisha, shortly after her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's decomposing body was found three days later by the boy's landlady, 
who made the grisly discovery when trying to locate the source of an odor. The 
body was stuffed between a bedroom wall and the headboard of the boy's water 
bed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He had set up a fan to blow the odor out an open window and had been sleeping 
in the room before the body was found, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt said the girl was strangled in the bedroom with a dog leash as the 
youth was sexually molesting her. Authorities did not reveal any further motive 
for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after Sara's death, the girl's father, Walter Scott Mann, 36, of 
Ojai shot and killed himself, falling dead on his daughter's grave in Newhall's 
Eternal Valley Memorial Park after an all-day vigil. He left a suicide note 
expressing his love for his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
At the sentencing, Duey said she will show that Cooper has "some sort of brain 
damage, very mild brain damage." She said several psychiatrists who have 
evaluated the youth will testify at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Duey added that the brain damage was not severe enough to warrant a plea of not 
guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Rosenblatt said she was pleased with the outcome of Thursday's 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"We were seeking the maximum and that's what we got," she said. "There was no 
plea bargain." 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, Linda Hodges, said she hopes that her daughter's killer 
can be rehabilitated. She blamed Sara's death "on the way society treats the 
mentally ill."

DUFFY EXPLAINS DETAILS OF HIS OUTSIDE INCOME; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SHERIFF HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE TO TALK ABOUT HIS JOBS AS A 
CONSULTANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy assembled selected reporters Thursday for a detailed 
walk-through of his outside consulting work since 1983, asserting that there 
has been nothing improper in the conduct of his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy confirmed that he had listed none of the income from consulting on his 
annual state disclosure forms, but said he believes none of it was required to 
be listed. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has announced that he intends to seek reelection next year, also 
said he already had made more money this year in outside work than in any of 
the six previous years he has been consulting. But he said he is not worried 
that voters will perceive that he isn't spending enough time at his elected 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour meeting, Duffy also produced tax information showing that he and 
his wife had paid only 6% of their gross income in 1988 in federal and state 
taxes -- or $8,166 out of a joint income of $137,028 -- but said that was 
because they took legitimate interest deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy called six newspaper and two television reporters to his office for the 
meeting in the wake of reports in The Times that he had worked for at least two 
private companies on law enforcement-related projects but didn't disclose his 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office announced last week that it had 
begun a review of state laws concerning what kind of outside income elected 
officials must publicly disclose and whether Duffy should have reported his 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to that review, one local attorney said last week he would ask the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission to look into Duffy's reporting 
practices, and another said he would ask for an inquiry from the sheriff's 
internal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy repeated Thursday what he said last week, that he did not report on his 
annual Statement of Economic Interest forms the outside income he earned over 
the past six years because he did not have to. 
</P>
<P>
"You think I'm going to fill out forms I don't need to fill out?" he said. "I 
mean, I got enough trouble, any elected official, any public official, has 
forms to fill out up the bazoo." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy produced a form he had prepared indicating he had earned $8,222 from 1983 
through 1988 working as a consultant on projects for the National Institute of 
Corrections, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, and for the private, 
for-profit firm Koba Associates in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was hired by Koba to work on seven consulting projects for the National 
Institute of Justice, earning $150 a day to review research projects. The money 
he earned on jail study projects since 1985 with the National Institute of 
Corrections ranged from $229 a day in 1985 to the current rate of $290 daily, 
Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Duffy said, he has been compensated for 50 days' work with the two 
organizations. Before this year, the most he had earned in outside work in any 
one year was $2,338, in 1985, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said his tax records indicated the money he earned on National Institute 
of Justice projects was paid to him by Koba, and income from the National 
Institute of Corrections studies was paid to him by Gubler &amp; Associates, a 
Salt Lake City firm. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he contended he was not obliged to report that money on his 
disclosure forms because those funds actually were supplied by the federal 
government, merely passing through the two firms. Taxpayers' money is not 
required to be disclosed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, Duffy also said he did not plan to report how much money 
he ends up earning this year consulting for the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1989, Duffy said he was gone on one job in April through Koba, again 
at $150 a day, for an estimated five days. He also said he had worked at least 
one day at $290 through Gubler for an NIC meeting in Colorado and would make 
the same rate with it again this weekend at a conference in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also has been paid $4,000 this year by a third company, Ralph Andersen 
&amp; Associates in Sacramento, for a consulting job that began late last year 
and concluded this February, reviewing the management structure of the 
Arlington, Tex., Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although Duffy said he is "confident" he does not have to officially disclose 
money from the first two companies, he said he does not know whether he will 
have to list that $4,000 on next year's form. 
</P>
<P>
The reporting rules require Duffy each year to list income of $250 or more from 
any source that is located in San Diego County, owns real estate in the county 
or conducts business in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Andersen firm contracted with county officials this year to stage a 
personnel classification seminar at the same time Duffy was working for the 
company on the Arlington consulting project. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope (the state Fair Political Practices Commission) rules on this one 
because (Andersen is) not located in S.D. County (and), other than some news 
report I read about that they once invited the county Personnel Department up 
to Newport Beach for some seminar, they have not done any business with San 
Diego County government," Duffy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If the FPPC rules that he has to report the $4,000, Duffy said, he will abide 
by that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he was not worried that the recent reports about his outside work 
will hurt his re-election chances next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can make a pretty good case during the campaign that my travels to 
Washington, D.C., my travels out of the county, many times directly and often 
indirectly benefited the citizens of San Diego County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy stressed that he has listed all of his income with the Internal Revenue 
Service and the state of California for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
He also produced another form he had prepared that indicated he and his wife, 
Linda, had paid at least $22,000 in taxes from 1984 through 1987. But, in 1988, 
they paid only the $8,166, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic difference was because of $84,000 they took in interest 
deductions, Duffy said. That figure was largely attributable to interest from a 
construction loan used to build their new house but also included interest from 
the mortgage on the house, a loan processing fee for the house and interest 
from the mortgage on their former residence, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has denounced The Times for its reports on his consulting work and for an 
earlier article about the amount of time he has spent traveling out of the 
county. He refused to allow Times reporter Richard A. Serrano, who wrote those 
articles, to take part in the interview Thursday.

GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS COALITION PUSHES GROWTH INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of government and business leaders announced Thursday that it 
intends to place initiatives aimed at controlling growth and unclogging 
roadways before both city and county voters on the June 1990 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the San Diego 2000 Committee said the organization's "Traffic 
Control and Comprehensive Growth Management" initiatives would require new 
development to pay at least $643 million toward construction of mass-transit 
lines, freeways and roads over the next 20 years. The blueprint would also 
curtail growth in areas where roads, parks, schools and other vital 
infrastructure are not available. 
</P>
<P>
"If the infrastructure isn't there, they don't build," said San Marcos Mayor 
Lee Thibadeau, a committee member. "And so they either put in the 
infrastructure along with the development, or, in the case of smaller 
development, they pay fees toward the infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement appeared to set up a confrontation between competing 
growth-control measures in the city of San Diego similar to the costly, bitter 
contest waged in 1988. Prevent Los Angelization Now, the successor organization 
to Citizens for Limited Growth, announced Oct. 19 that it will attempt to place 
a "planned-growth initiative" on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In the November, 1988, election, competing slow-growth measures sponsored by 
Citizens for Limited Growth and the San Diego City Council were defeated after 
a nearly $3-million spending campaign against the measures by the building 
industry. Similar initiatives covering unincorporated areas, sponsored by 
Citizens for Limited Growth and the county Board of Supervisors, met the same 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the San Diego 2000 Committee said the new initiatives are not 
sponsored by the Building Industry Assn., despite the presence among their 
leadership of Bruce H. Warren, vice president of H. G. Fenton Material Co., a 
commercial and industrial land developer. They expressed the hope, however, 
that some developers would back the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a BIA-sponsored measure," Warren said. But, he added, "I doubt 
they would be opposed." BIA leaders could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The group listed former State Sen. James Mills, now chairman of San Diego's 
Metropolitan Transit Development Board, as one leader, and Herb Cawthorne, 
Chamber of Commerce vice president, as spokesman. Cawthorne, who in June 
suddenly resigned as president of the San Diego Urban League amid reports of 
financial improprieties, was one of the leaders of an organization that 
unsuccessfully stumped for the City Council-backed growth-control measure in 
1988.

6 YEARS LATER, MCMARTIN CASE GOES TO JURY; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE FIRST ARREST OCCURRED IN 1983 AND IT COULD TAKE MONTHS YET FOR THE 
PANEL TO RENDER VERDICTS IN THE MOLESTATION CASE. IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST AND 
COSTLIEST CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IN HISTORY. 
</P>

<P>
Six years after the first arrest in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, 
12 jurors -- 10 of whom are parents themselves -- gathered around an 
eight-sided table Thursday to render judgment on the school's director and her 
son, accused of sexually abusing 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
The process could take months. It requires sifting through the testimony of 124 
witnesses compiled over a 2 1/2-year period and weighing the painful, sometimes 
bizarre, accounts given by the children against the defense's appeal to common 
sense and the defendants' claim of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a historic moment, but I'm too tired to enjoy it," Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said with a sigh after the jurors 
adjourned to select a foreman and begin deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders had expressed fears repeatedly that he would have to declare a 
mistrial, as health and job problems forced him to release six of the original 
18 regulars and alternates. By the end, the strain on the judge, the jury and 
the litigants had become visible. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the jurors are present on a day I think you may have felt would never 
arrive," he told the panel as it assembled for final instructions. "But it has, 
and as of today, we'll be turning the baton over to you . . . and we will sit 
back and watch." 
</P>
<P>
The judge then read 32 pages of jury instructions, some of which addressed 
children's testimony specifically: 
</P>
<P>
"Although, because of age and level of cognitive development, a child may 
perform differently as a witness from an adult, that does not mean that a child 
is any more or less credible a witness than an adult," he instructed. "You 
should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child solely because he or 
she is a child, nor should you believe such testimony solely because he or she 
is a child." 
</P>
<P>
When Pounders finished, the eight-man, four-woman panel retired to the 
18-by-21-foot jury room, where it will decide the guilt or innocence of 
defendants Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the trial have said privately that the jurors' lack of 
attention in recent days indicates they may have made up their minds already -- 
although not necessarily in unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors will not be sequestered, but will be watched by a bailiff while in the 
courthouse and escorted to and from lunch. Having been advised by Pounders to 
keep working when things are going well -- and to take frequent breaks or go 
home early when impasses occur -- the panelists will set their own daily 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is to turn in a verdict on each of the 65 counts as it is reached. The 
verdicts will be sealed and either read at intervals or when all have been 
completed, Pounders said. 
</P>
<P>
In the $15-million case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in 
history -- Ray Buckey, 31, faces 52 counts of molestation involving 11 
youngsters who attended his family's nursery school in Manhattan Beach. His 
mother, Peggy Buckey, 62, is charged with 12 counts of molestation involving 
four children. Both are charged with a single shared count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, both could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, the case now boils down to a question of whether the jury 
believes the testimony of the alleged victims, their parents, and physicians 
who examined them, or that of the defendants and other former teachers at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that the children were raped, sodomized, forced to 
participate in oral copulation, play "naked games," engage in pornographic 
photo sessions and satanic rituals, and were silenced by threats underscored by 
animal mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
The defense maintains that the children were programmed by therapists to 
believe something bad had happened to them, that their stories defy common 
sense, and that the medical evidence is unreliable and perhaps fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
The case began in August, 1983, when the mother of a 2 1/2-year-old called 
Manhattan Beach police after her son complained of rectal pain and she noticed 
he had a red bottom and implicated "Mr. Ray." Two physicians found medical 
evidence indicating he had been sodomized. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey was arrested and released, but the investigation continued -- 
eventually widening to include seven teachers at the prestigious seaside 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1984, the seven teachers, including elderly school founder and family 
matriarch Virginia McMartin, were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 
counts. That indictment was superseded by a 208-count complaint two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial on 
135 counts. But a week after the hearing ended, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner dropped 
charges against five defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The trial began in April, 1987, with 100 counts against Ray Buckey and his 
mother; the prosecution ultimately presented evidence on 65 counts. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the proceedings were marked by bizarre twists and turns: unforeseen 
delays, the capitulation of a prosecutor to the defense, the alcohol-related 
death of the young mother who triggered the case, the suicide of a defense 
investigator on the eve of his testimony, and the accidental drug overdose of 
an uncharged suspect that occurred after several McMartin children implicated 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Courtroom argument was so heated and character attacks so hostile that the 
judge commented several times that the case had "poisoned" everyone it had 
touched. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it became a race against time, with Pounders prodding the attorneys 
to wrap up testimony while there were still enough jurors left to deliberate.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 BROTHERS TO SERVE TIME FOR CYANIDE DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company that dumped 
thousands of gallons of cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer 
system pleaded guilty Thursday and must serve jail time for recklessly handling 
and storing hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Yoav (Joe) Pantilant, 52, of Woodland Hills, owner and president of 
All-American Plating Corp., was sentenced to nine months in jail, fined $10,000 
and ordered to clean up the site within six months by Municipal Judge David S. 
Milton as part of an agreement under which he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Sarv (Tom) Pantilant, 45, of Saugus, who was general manager of 
the firm, pleaded guilty to the same two charges and, also under the plea 
agreement, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 15 to six months in jail, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William W. Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers originally faced one felony count and seven misdemeanor counts in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
They were the first in the county to be prosecuted under a 10-month-old state 
law that mandates jail time for improperly storing hazardous materials, Carter 
said. The new law also allows authorities to take action against a firm before 
a potentially hazardous chemical spill occurs, he said.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ONE OF OREGON'S MOST WANTED MEN IS CAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California authorities have arrested one of Oregon's 10 most wanted criminals, 
a Los Angeles gang member who allegedly smuggled cocaine into Oregon, police 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Gibson, 23, was arrested last week in Los Angeles, Oregon State Police 
Lt. Cleve Veteto said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has waived his right to fight extradition and was expected to be 
returned this week to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson first was arrested in June, 1988, near Medford, Ore., and was charged 
with possession of cocaine and a stolen handgun. He was released on bail, fled 
the state and was later named to the "10 Most Wanted" list.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARMENIANS BLOCK ENTRY TO RED ARMY 
PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of about 1,000 chanting Armenian demonstrators blocked the entrances to 
Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on Thursday evening, delaying a concert by the 
175-member Soviet Red Army Chorus and dance ensemble for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to bring to public attention that the Red Army, instead of 
protecting its citizens, is firing on people," said Berdj Karapetian, a 
spokesman for the Armenia National Committee, one of two groups protesting 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than confront the demonstrators, police began escorting about 900 
ticket-holders into the auditorium through a side door shortly after 10 p.m. 
Several said protesters had pushed and shoved them as they stood in line to buy 
tickets for the 8 p.m. show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really aggravated," said Pat Radowitz, one ticket-holder. "I believe in 
freedom of speech, but I also believe in my right to see a concert." 
</P>
<P>
Police reported shouting matches between demonstrators and people trying to 
enter the auditorium for the show. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus was scheduled to appear in the United States in 1939 but was delayed 
for 50 years because of World War II, the Cold War and years of East-West 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's performance was the first of four scheduled for Los Angeles through 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
As the ticket-holders entered the side door, police declared an unlawful 
assembly and moved into the crowd of demonstrators, who dispersed peacefully.

RESEARCH OFFERS HOPE OF VACCINE FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers in San Diego have developed a vaccine against an animal disease 
that mimics the effects of multiple sclerosis in humans, according to an 
article in Thursday's issue of Science magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing research in San Diego and elsewhere now suggests that doctors might 
one day be able to prevent and treat diseases such as MS and diabetes, both of 
which occur when the body's immune system goes awry. 
</P>
<P>
MS is a chronic disease that causes weakness, tremors and paralysis. It affects 
as many as 250,000 Americans and about 10,000 new cases are reported annually 
in the United States. There is no cure for it. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Immune Response Corp., the small, La Jolla-based company where 
much of the research is being conducted, declined Thursday to talk about the 
article. The privately owned company is filing its initial public offering, and 
federal regulations temporarily prohibit officials from discussing the 
research, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a scientist in Portland who is conducting similar research described 
the San Diego group's report as "extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
"We found it very encouraging that (the San Diego researchers) found the same 
effects using their approach," said Dr. Arthur Vandenbark, a researcher at the 
Portland Veterans Affairs Center. Vandenbark and two other researchers last 
month reported on a similar vaccine advance in a Nature magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based researchers and the Portland group are using synthetic 
molecules to immunize mice against experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), an 
animal virus that produces MS-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
MS and EAE occur when the body is attacked by its own immune system. In both 
diseases, cells that normally keep organisms healthy by destroying foreign 
cells inexplicably attack nerve cells and cause neurological diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in the past have tried to combat the diseases with medications that 
keep the immune system from acting abnormally. But those treatments are the 
equivalent of "using a sledgehammer to blast the immune system," Vandenbark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in San Diego and Portland believe their advances could lead to a 
vaccine -- and, possibly, a cure -- that would "selectively turn off" 
individual parts of the immune system. "We're refining our ability to 
selectively regulate the immune response system rather than" use the 
sledgehammer approach, Vandenbark said.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2-HOUR DELAY IN RESPONSE TO 911 CALL 
INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials Thursday were investigating what was apparently a 
nearly two-hour delay in responding to a 911 call from a Brentwood restaurant 
manager who was reporting the robbery of a customer. 
</P>
<P>
Although the manager of the Hamburger Hamlet on San Vicente Boulevard maintains 
that he called 911 three times -- including one call during the Wednesday night 
robbery -- officers were not notified and dispatched to the restaurant until 
almost two hours later, long after the robber had fled with the victim's watch, 
reportedly worth $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Hall, detective commander at the West Los Angeles Division, admitted 
that a faster response might have resulted in the arrest of the robber, who was 
briefly detained by other restaurant customers after the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to determine how many calls were made, what the subject of each 
call was and why there was not a sooner response," said Cmdr. William Booth, 
LAPD spokesman. He added that investigators are combing through phone records 
and interviewing police detectives to find out what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly appears that the call we responded to was not the first call," he 
said.

ARTIST GETS EXTENSION ON REMOVAL OF CONTROVERSIAL 'MOON DIAL' SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halloween has come and gone, but "Moon Dial" remains to haunt Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over a strip of parkland like so many rusty pumpkins on poles, the 
lampooned public sculpture had faced an Oct. 31 city-imposed deadline for 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Hills officials who led a crusade against the artwork have agreed 
to delay the inevitable, allowing it to remain until late November, when the 
artist will be required to cut its winch, two window grates and five old buoys 
from their concrete moorings. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that anyone has grown more fond of "Moon Dial," but rather that artist 
George Herms was not able to cart it away on time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be moved. You can bank on it," said Ellen Byrens, chairwoman of 
the Fine Art Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Herms created the work at the invitation of the city's Fine Art Committee, an 
appointed group whose members thought that one of his assemblages would be just 
the thing for the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard and 
Palm Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But the work drew hundreds of complaints, and City Councilman Allan L. 
Alexander said last month that he hoped to celebrate the removal of "Moon Dial" 
on Oct. 31, the short end of its 18- to-36-month loan period. 
</P>
<P>
During the controversy, the City Council asked Herms last year to remove the 
work before 18 months were up, but he refused. Recently, Alexander and 
Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds instructed the Fine Art Committee to tell Herms 
that his time was up. 
</P>
<P>
City staffers said that they have been in contact with Herms and that he has 
promised to have it out by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that it's not art," Alexander said. "The 'Moon Dial' represents and 
is intended to represent decay, and that's not art that is appropriate for that 
location." 
</P>
<P>
"Moon Dial" is located in a narrow, carefully landscaped park at the eastern 
end of Beverly Hills. Herms has said that its rusting metal, a theme in many of 
his works, is intended to illustrate how man's achievements are vulnerable to 
forces of time and nature. 
</P>
<P>
Other loaned sculptures now on display along Santa Monica Boulevard may not be 
much better -- one looks like a giant rearing cricket of colorful confetti, 
another like a "happy face" on a watermelon slice. 
</P>
<P>
But they are not controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone may love it (the melon), but it doesn't create the extreme 
contrast to the beautiful setting that the 'Moon Dial' does," said Alexander, 
one of two City Council members named to oversee public art after Herms' work 
was unveiled to a cacophony of protest last April. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Fuher, a young artist, staged a sympathy demonstration of one in front of 
the "Moon Dial" last month, but the objections have not subsided. Actress 
Yvette Mimieux, a Bel-Air resident, called it a junk heap. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the idiots . . . who wanted it made live with it in their own back yards," 
she said in a letter to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The artist himself said that he was not able to remove his creation by the 
Halloween deadline because he was out of the country for much of October. And 
besides, he does not have anyplace to put it, he said. But he is looking for a 
new site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult when the piece was made for that exact location to begin to 
shop it around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herms' commercial work sells for between $5,500 and $30,000, said Jon E. 
Sorenson of L.A. Louver, the Venice gallery that represents him. 
</P>
<P>
But Herms said that he has no plans to sell "Moon Dial," which he put together 
from objects scrounged from a junkyard in El Monte and a marine salvage yard in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to offer it to the city as a permanent gift, he said. If that is 
turned down, he will have it photographed and present the picture instead. 
Herms said it would be a memorial to the late George Slaff, a former mayor who 
spoke up for "Moon Dial" when the controversy erupted last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of repression around, a lot of politicians wanting to censor the 
arts. The ones on our side who want to stand up for First Amendment rights 
should be honored," Herms said. 
</P>
<P>
Herms, 54, has had many exhibitions and received several federal grants. One of 
his earliest pieces, called simply Love, consists of an old leather pouch, a 
chain, a crucifix and a rusty film spool in a plain box. It dates from 1962. 
</P>
<P>
A recent work, Guitar Burst, is made of an old guitar crushed by a star-shaped 
wall clock. 
</P>
<P>
"People find his work very hard to deal with, but he's considered to be one of 
the most important members of the Assemblage movement," Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"His strength is transforming what people throw away into really beautiful 
objects."

'COERCIVE' COUNTY FUND-RAISING LIMITED; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITIES: A GROUP OF COUNTY EMPLOYEES ACCUSED THE COUNTY OF COERCING ITS 
WORKERS INTO CONTRIBUTING TIME AND MONEY TO FUND-RAISING EVENTS FOR THE UNITED 
WAY AND THE BROTHERHOOD CRUSADE. A JUDGE AGREED AND ISSUED A RESTRAINING ORDER. 
</P>

<P>
Describing the county's practice of soliciting charitable donations from its 
employees as "coercive," a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge issued a temporary 
restraining order Thursday, severely limiting the county's ability to raise 
funds for the United Way and the Brotherhood Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Dzentra Janavs issued the order in response to a lawsuit filed last month 
by a group of county employees. The complaint accused the county of coercing 
its workers into contributing time and money to fund-raising events for the two 
charities, which serve as umbrella organizations to distribute donations to the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the county's Community Support Program netted $2.6 million through a 
variety of events -- including raffles, barbecues, award presentations and 
personal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing the restraining order, Janavs said the evidence indicates that 
county employees were under pressure from their superiors to work "countless 
hours" at taxpayer expense to raise contributions for United Way and the 
Brotherhood Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is overwhelming that thousands of hours are spent for United Way 
on county time," Janavs said. "The public has no idea of the extent of 
taxpayers' funds you put into this." 
</P>
<P>
Janavs' temporary restraining order limits the solicitation of funds from 
county employees to 15-minute presentations at regularly scheduled department 
meetings and to the distribution of literature, said Richard Townsend, 
principal deputy county counsel, who defended the county's program. 
</P>
<P>
"This order will have a significant impact on our ability to provide the 
necessary funds to health and human services in the county," said Clarence 
Brown, a spokesman for United Way. "We serve 350 charities and if we are $1 
million short, that will hurt those agencies and hamper our ability to respond 
to emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the current United Way campaign, which began in September and ends 
in December, has achieved about 50% of its goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Sutton, spokesman for the Brotherhood Crusade, said the organization will 
"continue to work within the current framework and hope to raise funds to help 
people to help themselves.' 
</P>
<P>
In defense of the county program, Townsend said that most county employees 
support the current means of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"The current program is more economical than letting employees handle it in an 
ad hoc basis, like passing around the coffee can," he said. "These programs 
benefit the county and they are the same programs that the county distributes 
taxpayers' money to -- AIDS hospices, runaway shelters, drug and alcohol abuse 
centers and senior citizens' centers. It's like getting double bang for the 
buck." 
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuit, the employees said that pressure to contribute comes from top 
managers concerned that their promotions and pay raises will be pegged to the 
level of support their subordinates give to the charities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contained no allegations against the United Way or the Brotherhood 
Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an isolated incident," said Rees Lloyd, an attorney with the Robin 
Hood Foundation, which is representing the county workers. "The problem of 
coercion is systemic and the pressure runs down from the department heads to 
the rank and file." 
</P>
<P>
The judge praised Peter Wood, a 29-year county water supply technician who 
supervises 22 workers, for his courage to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit says Wood was instructed by his superiors to inform two student 
workers to sign up for contributions to United Way, or they would no longer be 
employed by the county. In a sworn deposition, Wood said he believed that 
pressure was applied because top department supervisors are judged for merit 
raises and promotions on factors that include their ability to persuade 
employees to contribute to charities. 
</P>
<P>
Wood brought his complaint to the Robin Hood Foundation, which frequently 
represents county employees with grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend assured Janavs that Wood's experience was an isolated incident and 
that Wood's supervisor has issued a letter of apology to the students. 
</P>
<P>
After the employees' suit was filed last month, a different judge issued a 
temporary restraining order instructing the county to make clear to its 80,000 
employees that they will not be punished for not contributing to the two 
charities. The order also temporarily barred the county from evaluating its 
managers on the level of donations by their employees. 
</P>
<P>
United Way is also under another restraining order, the result of a separate 
suit, barring it from distributing pledge cards to state employees without 
attaching designation cards that allow donors to give to non-United Way 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
That order grew out of a $6-million suit filed last month by three other 
charities, claiming they have been denied a fair chance to get payroll 
deduction donations from state employees.

STATE SUES ST. JOHN FOR FAILURE TO FILE REPORT ON FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The state attorney general's office on Thursday sued Juanita St. John, the head 
of a beleaguered Los Angeles-Africa trade task force, for refusing to publicly 
disclose how the nonprofit, city-funded corporation has spent hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual lawsuit charges that St. John and her Task Force for Africa-Los 
Angeles Relations are four years delinquent in filing state-mandated reports 
detailing the group's finances. It is the latest in a series of investigations 
and legal troubles to beset Mayor Tom Bradley's scandal-plagued pet project. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi, who filed the suit after several months of 
discussions with St. John and her lawyers, said the action is "pretty unusual . 
. . most charitable organizations usually comply (with requests for financial 
records) after being warned." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney and the Los Angeles Police Department 
are investigating St. John, a Bradley business associate, who headed the task 
force at a time when the mayor was pushing to secure about $400,000 in city 
funds for the group. The task force was set up in 1982 to promote trade and 
cultural ties between Los Angeles and African countries. 
</P>
<P>
One focus of the probe is to determine if St. John, who allegedly commingled 
task force funds in family checking accounts, used any of the money to bail 
herself out of personal financial problems, including two bankruptcies she 
filed since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks an accounting -- under 
penalty of perjury -- of the task force's operations since 1985, including the 
total amount of St. John's salary and the names of corporate directors who 
should have been supervising the group's financial affairs. City auditors and 
investigators have been unable to determine how much money she was entitled to 
take from the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also calls for repayment of any funds St. John or others may have used 
improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Podberesky, one of St. John's lawyers, said the lawsuit was "not 
unexpected" and her client would have no comment. She stressed that St. John 
has done nothing illegal and would be able to explain how the funds were used. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that records sought by the state are being assembled and checked 
by an accountant to ensure they contain no errors. 
</P>
<P>
City auditors have said that the task force, which figured prominently in the 
controversy surrounding Bradley's finances, owes the city more than $260,000 
and that St. John failed to account for nearly $180,000 she personally withdrew 
from the group's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney is also considering suing St. John and the task force to 
recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
While the information sought by the state is routinely filed by most nonprofit 
groups, St. John and her lawyers have repeatedly refused to file the crucial 
documents. Last month, St. John invoked the 5th Amendment more than 60 times 
when she was subpoenaed before a City Council committee that wanted an 
explanation of where the tax money went. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old San Marino resident also faces a criminal trial Dec. 21 on a 
misdemeanor charge of violating a city controller's subpoena for the records. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general, who supervises nonprofit groups, also named four other 
task force officials in the suit: San Gabriel Valley business executive Richard 
Parsons, Los Angeles newspaper publisher C.Z. Wilson, retired Los Angeles 
businessman Hans Ries and Los Angeles attorney Howard Manning, all of whom were 
listed at one time as officers of the task force in state records. All four 
have told The Times they had had no involvement with the task force in recent 
years, or had no responsibility for the group's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Cordi, of the attorney general's office, indicated he may add other names to 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who helped create the task force, regularly attended meetings and 
evaluated St. John for pay raises, has told investigators that he was a task 
force board member. But aides said he misspoke and is merely a member of the 
group's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Cordi said he has seen no evidence indicating that the mayor should be held 
personally liable for any misuse of task force funds.

GIRL SHOT ON CAMPUS AT EAST S.D. SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stray bullet from an apparent drive-by shooting struck an 11-year-old Mann 
Middle School girl in the thigh Thursday afternoon shortly after classes were 
dismissed for the day at the East San Diego campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people said to be Laotian in a car fired one or more shots at a 
Cambodian man waiting to pick up a relative at the school, according to police 
and school district sources. The shooting took place several hundred feet from 
the school, but one bullet apparently grazed the girl, who was standing with 
friends on the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose name was not released, was taken by school police to Kaiser 
Hospital, where a nursing supervisor said she was treated in the emergency room 
and released. Police are investigating.

SERRA'S GABAY SELECTED STATE TEACHER OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
English teacher Janis T. Gabay of Serra High School was named the California 
1990 Teacher of the Year by state schools Supt. Bill Honig. Gabay had been one 
of three San Diego County teachers of the year selected earlier this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gabay, a 17-year veteran in the San Diego Unified School District, will receive 
$15,000 and become the state's nominee for national teacher of the year. Gabay 
received her award Thursday in Los Angeles, gaining the top honors after 
several months of screenings, essay writing and classroom visits from a 
committee headed by Honig. 
</P>
<P>
"Janis embodies all the best qualities we've been working toward with 
educational reform over the past six years," Honig said Thursday. "She begins 
from the important premise that all students can achieve and will succeed. She 
sets high standards, follows a rigorous curriculum, employs a variety of 
teaching techniques, relates academics to the 'real world,' and pushes her 
students to excel." 
</P>
<P>
Gabay teaches advanced placement English to seniors and sophomore English at 
Serra High, a heterogeneous school with students both from longtime Tierrasanta 
families and the sprawling Murphy Canyon housing complex for enlisted Navy 
personnel. For five years, she has also had the title "mentor teacher," an 
honor given by other teachers under which a mentor conducts seminars and 
workshops for colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Gabay, 39, was born in Maui, Hawaii, but came to San Diego as a child and 
attended San Diego city schools, receiving a diploma from Madison High School. 
At San Diego State University, she earned a bachelor's degree, a secondary 
teaching credential, a specialist teaching credential in gifted education, and 
a community college instructor credential. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the required essays during the competition, Gabay wrote: "A basic 
tenet of my philosophy of teaching is that I am teaching to the whole child, 
not simply to that part of him or her that needs language arts skills." 
</P>
<P>
Gabay is the first San Diego County teacher to win the state honor since 
Patricia Oyeshiku of Morse High School received it in 1981.

WOMEN STILL BOWLED OVER BY POLICE RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Granada Lanes bowling alley Thursday, Sandy Scholnick spotted a woman 
holding a stack of cash near the scorer's table and told her, "I put in a 20." 
</P>
<P>
Then she cringed. The mere mention of money at the Granada Hills alley was 
enough to turn heads during the weekly games of the Dawnbreakers League. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's only league fees," Scholnick quickly assured other bowlers and 
observers. "I'm just paying my league fees." 
</P>
<P>
And so it went a week after Scholnick and four other league bowlers -- 
including two grandmothers -- were cited by the Los Angeles police vice squad 
for gambling, the evidence being the $15.50 in side pots that winners of the 
weekly bowling matches were to split. 
</P>
<P>
But the cloud of disrepute that hung over Scholnick, 35, of Northridge; Pamela 
Waizenegger, 33, of Panorama City; Anne Barnett, 34, of Sepulveda, and Esther 
Martinez, 48, and Ollie Shores, 62, both of Chatsworth, did not last long. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the five housewives' outrage over the undercover investigation that 
was prompted by an anonymous tip, police later took back the misdemeanor 
citations, gave back the money and added a warning: No more gambling. 
</P>
<P>
So Thursday, when the women returned to the scene of the crime, there was no 
gambling and barely a mention of money -- at least while most of the reporters 
and the television cameras were there. 
</P>
<P>
Waizenegger acknowledged that she quietly passed winnings from a pre-bust side 
pot to another bowler but wagered nothing Thursday. She and the other women 
wondered if the league would ever be the same without money -- even small 
amounts -- riding on the matches, and they said they didn't know how long they 
would continue competing solely for honor and trophies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be boring," said Scholnick, a member of the Bowl Weevils team. 
</P>
<P>
The side pots, the bowlers claim, are a league tradition and they may decide to 
revive them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss it," added Waizenegger, a member of the 10-for-10s team. "It 
kind of spiced things up. I think we'll have to wait awhile, until things cool 
down, before we decide." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no telling when the heat will be off. The women still don't know 
who the anonymous tipster was who turned them in. And though there seemed to be 
no indication that police were watching activities at the bowling alley 
Thursday, the media was. The bowling alley bust has been big news. 
</P>
<P>
The self-proclaimed "notorious five" were greeted at the alley by newspaper and 
TV reporters. The nationally circulated Bowling Journal sent reporter Damon 
Cardwell, who agreed with the women's contention that side pots are part of 
bowling leagues everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurs in every league at every bowling alley in the country," Cardwell 
said. "It is so commonplace it is almost part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The women were interviewed, videotaped and photographed while bowling. Barnett, 
for one, saw her scores drop below her 150 average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of distracting," said Barnett, who added that she, Waizenegger and 
Scholnick are scheduled to tape an appearance on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny 
Carson today. "But we're trying to have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
On the official league score card Thursday, Scholnick scratched out the name 
Bowl Weevils -- the team four of the cited women belong to -- and penciled in a 
new name. From now on, the team is to be known as the Jailbirds.

DEVELOPER'S PLAN DIVIDES NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: A WOODLAND HILLS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN TOLD TO PUT UP WITH AGING 
TWO-STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS OR ACCEPT A TALLER COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer has presented a group of Woodland Hills residents with a choice: 
Put up with the deteriorating two-story apartment buildings adjacent to their 
homes, or allow him to build a taller, luxury apartment complex in their place. 
</P>
<P>
The choice has divided homeowners who live near the apartment buildings on 
Avenue San Luis between Abbeyville and Dunman avenues, which mainly house 
low-income Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the property owners say that they are concerned about gang 
members who reportedly live in the buildings and that they are tired of noise 
from the project, they are convinced that a taller building, even if more 
attractive, would just add to their woes. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Connelly, who has lived in the area for more than six years, 
acknowledged that the two-story apartment buildings have caused problems. But 
replacing them with a taller complex is not the answer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A building that large will cut off my sunlight and take away my feeling of 
openness," said Connelly, whose back yard is adjacent to the buildings. "I 
don't want to live next to a high-rise. If I wanted to do that, I would move to 
Warner Center." 
</P>
<P>
But Osie Smaeff, who has resided in the community for two years, said she 
prefers the proposed project. "I get glasses and beer in my back yard all the 
time, and I always hear shotguns," she said. "I don't like what's there one 
bit. Now we can get rid of it. I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts said the proposed project would also raise property values. 
They estimated that homes in the area are worth $315,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
The group of apartment complexes, totaling 91 units, has been plagued with an 
increasing number of problems in recent years, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bill Martin of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley gang unit 
said that residents had complained of noise and gunshots coming from the 
apartments and that gang graffiti has been seen on walls in the area. "Their 
concerns seem to be valid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Miscikowski, deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the 
area, said some of the one-bedroom apartments are inhabited by more than one 
family. She said it was not unusual for seven or eight people to be living in 
one apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks-based Lycon Group wants to develop a 223-unit, two-building 
apartment complex on the site. William S. Lyons, president of the firm, said 
the apartments would be luxury residences and would rent for at least $1,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the buildings would have a pool, spa, recreation room and suntan booth, 
Lyons told a group of homeowners Wednesday. The buildings would have three 
stories of living space, with parking for residents and guests underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Piele, a real estate broker who owns property in the area, said initially 
that he was opposed to the project. But he said he was swayed when the Lycon 
Group agreed to a number of concessions requested by the homeowners, including 
the planting of $300,000 worth of landscaping to shield the back, front and 
sides of the complex from neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
"They are willing to do a lot of things to make it work," Piele said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said he wanted to give eviction notices to the present residents later 
this month and start construction on the complex early next year. 
</P>
<P>
But city codes stipulate that nothing above two stories can be built in the 
area without the approval of at least half of the residents. Piele said the 
project has the necessary backing in the community. The project must also be 
approved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of those in the neighborhood charged the project's advocates with 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the people who live there now going to go?" said resident Joyce 
Piper. She said the apartment proposal was a ploy to evict low-income people 
from the area. "It's awful. These folks are going to be homeless." 
</P>
<P>
But Piele said it was not a matter of racism. "We're talking about neighborhood 
blight here," he said. "That's a cold, hard fact." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident was more adamant. "There are no other options," said Sandy 
Sklar, who has lived in the area for two years. "That place is bringing down 
our values. We don't want those people here. Do you really care about those 
people, or about your property values? I know what I'd pick."

SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN TO SUE DUFFY OVER CAMPAIGN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache said Thursday that he will go to court to overturn a 
department policy prohibiting his candidacy for sheriff because he has been 
told that Sheriff John Duffy, who plans to seek reelection next year, will not 
respond to his request to rescind the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, however, in a meeting with selected reporters Thursday, said a new 
policy will be substituted, and Roache will be allowed to run against him. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd like to do is find a way for Roache to run without getting in any 
trouble," Duffy said. "He's just going to have to be patient" while the 
department's legal advisers come up with a substitute policy. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy also said another department policy strictly prohibits Roache from 
publicly criticizing the sheriff or the department. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he has had no direct communication with Duffy. But he said an 
emissary from Duffy's office visited him at the Lemon Grove station Wednesday 
and warned him against criticizing Duffy or the current management of the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Without saying that the warning was tantamount to a political threat, Roache 
said it would make it extremely difficult for him to wage a campaign against 
Duffy if he could not speak out about problems with the sheriff or his 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"From a practical matter, it would be next to impossible," he said, "unless you 
have the freedom to address the crucial issues. That would mean some direct 
reference or criticism of the current Sheriff's Department's management and 
operational policies." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Everett Bobbitt, said the admonition against Roache criticizing 
Duffy or the Sheriff's Department violates his client's right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an outrageous infringement upon the First Amendment," Bobbitt 
said. "It's a thinly veiled attempt to prevent criticisms of candidate Duffy 
and to prevent one of the most qualified people in the county from running 
against him." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said he is preparing to file a request early next week for a judge to 
issue a temporary restraining order to let Roache retain his captain's position 
and run for sheriff. According to the policy, no staff members are allowed to 
run against the sheriff, if that sheriff is seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy earlier this year announced his attention to seek an unprecedented sixth, 
four-year term as the county's highest law enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, who has been a member of the department for 18 years and serves as 
captain of the Lemon Grove station, asked Duffy in two recent letters to 
rescind the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has personally ignored both letters, Roache said. Instead, Roache said 
that Duffy on Wednesday sent Sheriff's Cmdr. Myron A. Klippert to visit him. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said Klippert said "he was coming on behalf of the sheriff," and then 
told him that he was to work an eight-hour shift for the department, take an 
hour for lunch and refrain from any negative public comments about Duffy or the 
department management. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said that Klippert also indicated that he would be disciplined if he 
spoke out publicly in a negative way about Duffy or the department. 
</P>
<P>
Klippert, who as commander of the department's Law Enforcement Operations 
Bureau is Roache's direct supervisor, was out of town Thursday and could not be 
reached for comment.

MAN SURRENDERS, SAYS HE ROBBED 2 GAS STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A wild night that began with two robberies netting $31.50 ended when the 
alleged robber surrendered at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station early 
Thursday, telling authorities that he had used the money to buy crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Watters, 33, a transient, was being held on suspicion of robbery at the 
Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"He confessed to both robberies and gave himself up," Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Gary Weeks said Watters did not explain his speedy surrender. Watters 
told deputies that he used the money from the robberies to buy crack cocaine 
and that he was high on crack when he gave himself up, Weeks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people surrender before, but it's not an everyday occurrence," Weeks 
said. "Very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Watters walked into the sheriff's station about 4:35 a.m. and told a surprised 
deputy that he had committed two robberies. 
</P>
<P>
According to deputies, Watters said he robbed an attendant at a Chevron station 
at 10th Street West and Avenue K in Lancaster about 1:35 a.m. Thursday, then 
robbed a clerk at the Filling Station on Sierra Highway in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at those businesses said the man who robbed them pretended to have a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Jordan, the Chevron station manager, said the attendant who was robbed 
told him: "The guy came up and said, 'Do you want to get shot? Give me all the 
money.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the attendant showed him that there was no money except in a locked safe, 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
"So he said, 'Give me your wallet,' " Jordan said. "He got about a buck-fifty." 
</P>
<P>
The robber fled on foot, deputies said. About five minutes later, a man 
matching Watters' description confronted a clerk at the other gas station, also 
placing his hand by his waistband as if he had a gun. He took $30, deputies 
said.

WEEKENDER: 40TH-ANNIVERSARY SYMPHONY BASH, READING OF AWARD-WINNING PLAY ARE 
FREE FOR ALL.

A musician who grew to love the violin after his father made him play the 
instrument will help the Beach Cities Symphony celebrate its 40th anniversary 
tonight, and on Sunday a new playwright will unleash the spirits of a 
success-driven Victorian woman. 
</P>
<P>
The symphony -- initially composed of 45 musicians -- performed for the first 
time at the Mira Costa High School auditorium in November, 1949, giving South 
Bay residents a sample of their musical talents. 
</P>
<P>
Now a 70-piece community-based orchestra, the symphony will open its 40th 
season with a free concert featuring violinist Stuart Canin. Organizers said 
they expect between 800 and 1,000 music lovers to attend the concert at 8:15 
tonight in Marsee Auditorium on the El Camino College campus, 16007 Crenshaw 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Canin will perform Henry Wieniawski's Violin Concerto No. 2 in D Minor, a 
romantic work he calls "a perfect concerto." 
</P>
<P>
Canin, former concertmaster with the San Francisco and Glendale symphonies, is 
senior lecturer in music at UC Santa Barbara and teaches violin there. 
</P>
<P>
In June, he was in China, teaching master classes to teen-agers at Shanghai 
Conservatory, when the failed and bloody uprising occurred in Beijing. He was 
unhurt and was able to complete his teaching assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Canin, 63, first began to study the violin as a preschooler. A native of New 
York City, he recalls that his father was "a frustrated amateur violinist who 
passed the violin on to his first son." 
</P>
<P>
At age 5, Canin said, he began to enjoy playing the violin. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Jerome Kessler will lead the orchestra in playing selections from 
Brahms and Rossini. 
</P>
<P>
The symphony is primarily composed of non-professional South Bay musicians, 
said Kessler, the orchestra's music director since June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This orchestra is a very good orchestra," said Robert L. Peterson, chairman of 
the symphony's 25-member board and a French horn player in the symphony since 
the early days. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said all of the symphony's concerts are free, and the orchestra relies 
upon private contributions to help meet its monetary obligations. The 
symphony's annual budget is about $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the symphony's first 40 years, Peterson said: "It's been a long, 
long healthy growth time, with some highs and lots of lows, too." 
</P>
<P>
Play enthusiasts can enjoy a free theatrical presentation at 2 p.m. Sunday at 
the Norris Theatre located near Crossfield Drive and Indian Peak Road in the 
Peninsula Center in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
A cast of 10 will read 37-year-old playwright Mara Fein's award-winning 
romantic drama, "An Experiment in Life." 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first reading for the piece, which spans 25 years of Victorian 
novelist Mary Ann Evans' life. Evans, who wrote under the pseudonym George 
Eliot, was obsessive about pleasing her husband, George Henry Lewes, an English 
critic and writer, Fein said. 
</P>
<P>
Fein, a USC professor of English, said she believes the play transcends time 
because of its strong emotionality, and she hopes it will evolve into a full 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"An Experiment in Life" placed second in the Norris Playwriting Competition 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's Play Discovery Project sponsors the competition to identify new 
talent, said Renata Rafferty, a spokeswoman for the Norris. She praised the 
biographical play as "a good, solid work." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no costumes, lighting or sets, but the staged reading will give 
Fein an opportunity to fine-tune her work, Rafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
Fein, who is working on her doctorate in Victorian literature, said the 
experiment in the title of her play refers to Evans' refusal to conform to 
society's view of what a woman's life should be. 
</P>
<P>
Fein, who called Evans her "literary idol," said she could understand Evans' 
insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like Mary Ann," Fein said, "I need my husband's assurance that I am a 
good writer." Alisa Samuels

ANOTHER CRUEL S&amp;L IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress has now been told that the $50-billion bailout of bankrupt savings and 
loan institutions that it approved only three months ago is inadequate to the 
need. L. William Seidman, chairman of the agency charged with trying to clean 
up the S&amp;L mess, says that the Resolution Trust Corp. needs a further $50 
billion to $100 billion in working capital to take over hundreds of additional 
failing S&amp;Ls, make good on individual deposits of up to $100,000, and 
arrange for the orderly disposal of salable assets. Earlier projections were 
that the $50 billion in bonds approved for sale in August could, after interest 
payments are taken into account, carry a final cost over 30 years of $300 
billion. The new estimate of need by the RTC makes it clear that even this 
incredible amount will be only a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee Seidman briefed was clearly disturbed, both over the 
magnitude of the problem it heard outlined and the RTC's belief that it doesn't 
require specific new authority to borrow more. In the end, though, it's hard to 
see how Congress can avoid going along with increased borrowing to salvage 
collapsing lending institutions. Word that the RTC has now identified a further 
223 shaky S&amp;Ls could eventually bring to more than 500 the number subject 
to federal seizure. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the assets of these institutions total about $276 billion, but it's 
far from clear what their real market value might be. Ultimately, after sound 
mortgages are sold to other institutions, the RTC stands to become the owner of 
200,000 pieces of property. In time, all this will have to be disposed of in 
ways that won't disturb local real estate and financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Who pays for cleaning up this enormous man-made mess? Taxpayers, of course, who 
will be called on to cover about 75% of the rescue plan's total cost. The rest 
would come from higher premiums on the deposit insurance that is required of 
banks and other savings institutions. Yet, even in the face of these costs, 
Congress and the Bush Administration have shown little interest in imposing or 
reimposing the kind of controls that could reduce the chance that another 
collapse could occur. That is a mistake. The need for stricter regulation is 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L disaster, as hearings and court cases have shown, was to a great 
extent the result of incredibly inept management practices, unrestrained 
personal corruption and greed, and basic structural flaws, all helped along by 
a political climate that encouraged relaxed oversight by federal regulatory 
agencies. A chief purpose of federal regulation is to detect and halt 
activities and practices that threaten to harm the public. That mechanism 
proved grossly inadequate in the case of the S&amp;Ls. One consequence is that 
taxpayers well into the next generation and beyond are going to be burdened by 
a staggering added layer of debt. That this happened during a period when any 
reduction in the role of government was advertised as an unqualified benefit 
has to be seen as one of the crueler political ironies of our time.

SOVIET CRISIS AND ARMAMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So officials of the Soviet Union have decided to tell the citizens of that 
country the truth about the breakdown of their system for the distribution of 
consumer goods! It was news to me, also. Recent articles in The Times have 
painted a picture of such gross mismanagement, confusion and bad faith that I 
think we should re-evaluate our alliances and priorities in foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. President and Congress, the Soviet Union is down for the count! The Soviets 
are no longer a threat, as they can't even get their trains and trucks to run! 
It's time to stop spending money to defend our nation against an old "enemy" 
which is so gravely ailing. 
</P>
<P>
Why not balance our budget by canceling defense industry projects such as the 
B-1 Stealth bomber and nuclear armaments? Why not?

APPLAUSE FOR A PILOT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reverse the disturbing decline in the number of minority 
teachers, Cal State Dominguez Hills is going beyond platitudes about 
encouraging more minorities to become teachers. The university, one of the few 
in the state with a student body that is 60% black, Latino and Asian, is 
working as part of a nationwide network to ensure that future schoolchildren -- 
one in three of which will be minority by the turn of the century -- can find 
role models in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez, along with New York's Fordham University, City College and 
Hostos Community College of New York, and Xavier University in New Orleans have 
been brought together for a pilot project by the Ana G. Mendez Educational 
Foundation, which operates three colleges in Puerto Rico. The schools all have 
large minority enrollments and a demonstrated interest in training minority 
teachers. The pilot project will make it easier for the consortium members to 
share information about each one's recruitment programs and to disseminate the 
information nationwide to show others what works best. 
</P>
<P>
This consortium of colleges and universities is working to attract more 
talented black, Latino and Asian students to the teaching profession by 
exposing high school students to the special satisfactions of the classroom. At 
present, minorities make up only 9% of all teachers, compared to 17% in the 
mid-1970s. As career and economic opportunities expanded for minorities and 
women, many chose not to become teachers. But teacher salaries are finally 
rising. And now educators must lure students back to the profession by exposing 
them early to the rewards of teaching and to the lasting impact a good teacher 
has on students. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez is already in the third year of its own Saturday Future 
Teachers Institute, supported by the Carnegie Corp. of New York, in which high 
school students are paid $15 per Saturday to teach math and science to 
elementary school students for 10 weeks. The Saturday program is the first time 
many youngsters have ever set foot on a college campus; soon the idea of 
attending college, or maybe eventually teaching in one, becomes less 
intimidating. Tracking of some former "teachers," now college students, 
indicates that half of them remain strongly interested in becoming professional 
teachers. It is already an accomplishment that more bright students are 
seriously considering a lifetime in the classroom to lead a new generation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's schizophrenia over the environment and natural 
resources is nowhere more apparent right now than in the proposed renewal of 
40-year irrigation contracts between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and 
California farmers. The internal struggle represents a major conflict between 
the Environmental Protection Agency and Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.'s Department 
of the Interior, with the Council on Environmental Quality siding with EPA. 
This is viewed by many in the Administration as a critical test case. The issue 
has not caught much attention outside of selected California constituencies, 
but its outcome could determine the Administration's future course on 
environmental matters and Lujan's ability to survive as a politically viable 
secretary of interior. 
</P>
<P>
If the Administration follows logic and apparent legal precedent, it will order 
a full environmental impact study of the contract renewals and their 
considerable effect on California's complex water distribution system. If the 
Administration elects to hew to the narrow and tenuous legal claims of the 
Department of the Interior, it will reject an environmental study. The question 
is whether the Administration will relent now and maintain President Bush's 
desire to be a friend of the environment. Or whether it will side with mostly 
Republican friends in the agricultural community, give away considerable 
environmental credibility, and possibly lose the issue in the courts anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The only reasonable answer is to proceed with the environmental impact report. 
This may embarrass Secretary Lujan, but it will not necessarily mean the 
farmers will lose any of the water they have been using from the Bureau of 
Reclamation's Central Valley Project the past 40 years. For the Administration 
to uphold Lujan's defiance of EPA would have the same effect as saying it 
believes in the National Environmental Policy Act, the keystone of American 
environmental law, only when it chooses to. From that point on, any claim by 
Bush that he is a friend of the environment will have quite a hollow ring. 
</P>
<P>
The somewhat unfortunate scapegoat of the affair is the Orange Cove Irrigation 
District on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley, the first of some 300 
districts to sign water delivery contracts with the Central Valley Project, in 
July, 1949. Orange Cove is not typical of the agribusinesses that have been the 
principal targets of conservation organizations such as the Natural Resources 
Defense Council for receiving subsidized federal irrigation water, sometimes 
for growing subsidized crops. Most Orange Cove farms are small family 
operations that use water efficiently. Lujan issued a new 40-year contract to 
Orange Cove last summer in definance of EPA's decision. The Department of 
Interior claims that other federal law requires it to renew the contracts and 
that no formal impact study was required. The Council on Environmental Quality, 
an arm of the White House that attempts to settle intra-Administration disputes 
of this sort, has sided with EPA. Lujan has had the matter under review ever 
since and is expected to announce a decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA position reportedly also has struck a sympathetic chord within the 
Justice Department where Richard Stewart is the chief environmental lawyer, a 
former Harvard Law professor and former chairman of the board of the 
Environmental Defense Fund. Stewart, however, must defend the Department of 
Interior against a Natural Resources Defense Council lawsuit that seeks to 
force Interior to do the environmental analysis. 
</P>
<P>
While only the one irrigation district is directly involved, the outcome of the 
dispute will set a precedent for hundreds of contracts that will be expiring 
throughout the West. The Central Valley Project of California alone distributes 
some 7 million acre-feet of water a year, or more than seven times as much 
water as the city of Los Angeles uses annually. 
</P>
<P>
To ignore the environmental effects of such diversions is to show indifference 
to massive alterations in California's water system over the years and to defy 
the changing nature of its water needs. The Bush Administration could set 
national water policy ahead by years if it approved the environmental studies, 
perhaps in a joint venture with California, and used them as the centerpiece 
for the reconciliation of a variety of water problems affecting both farmers 
and city folk.

GOODWIN ON ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problem with Goodwin's views of the environment is their theological and 
dogmatic character. He does not write of environmental policies that may ensure 
that, on balance, living conditions can continue to improve for most people. 
Instead, he sets forth what can only be described as the tenets of a religion 
of nature worship. 
</P>
<P>
It is all too obvious that he has intense dislike for our technical and 
industrial civilization; that he regards it as an affront to nature, and that 
he regards nature as a vengeful god who will exact a horrible price. Certainly 
he is welcome to share these views with his friends. But why should the rest of 
us believe him? Once again, we have a liberal of the gloom-and-doom school who 
says: Disaster lies ahead; but if you give me full power, I will help things to 
get worse a little more slowly. Who needs that?

BEFORE GOING TO SUMMIT, APPLY A BIT OF PRUDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: THE WEST URGENTLY NEEDS A VISION OF A NEW EUROPE. THE RISK IS CREATING 
ONE WITHOUT AN ALLIED BLUEPRINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is vice president for regional programs 
and director of European studies at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The forthcoming "saltwater summit" between George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
is being billed as unremarkable -- but that gives it importance. 
</P>
<P>
When the American and Soviet presidents can begin to meet routinely, the Cold 
War is surely being consigned to the ash heap of history. Yet this friendly 
get-together also has risks. And it dramatizes the urgent need for the West to 
create a vision of Europe's future and to set goals for achieving it. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, everyone benefits. Gorbachev gains added legitimacy for 
reforming his domestic economy and lowering global tensions. He also gains 
another symbol of equality with the U.S. President, which provides political 
value home at a time when economic reform is faltering. 
</P>
<P>
Just by showing up, Bush confounds domestic critics who charge him with being 
timid. He also tells European allies that he is in the East-West game and he 
builds a case against being faulted for "losing" Gorbachev if the Soviet leader 
is either deposed or forced to retrench. Most important, the world benefits 
from the steady transformation of U.S.-Soviet relations from episodic 
confrontation to a halting but significant search for common ground. 
</P>
<P>
But the very fact that Bush foresees an agenda-free meeting points to an area 
of possible misunderstanding. In his announcement, he stressed "the rapidity of 
change in Eastern Europe." Indeed, given what has been happening, the summit 
will no doubt be widely judged on the basis of what the two leaders either say, 
or refrain from saying, about the extraordinary unraveling of the Soviet 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, the allies should not complain. After all, the American 
President is responding to their plea to seize the initiative, and they have 
not developed their own design for a new structure of European security and 
East-West political relations. Yet complaints there will surely be if conduct 
at the summit gives even a hint of U.S.-Soviet coordination on East European 
matters. In particular, the West German government has been stung by U.S. media 
criticism that it has been overly zealous in its dealings with the East and 
that it cannot be trusted with the explosive subject of reunification. A 
Bush-Gorbachev meeting that centers on East European issues will clearly 
stiffen West German resistance to any cavilling about its own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
There would be little concern, however, if the casual approach to the summit 
did not highlight the continued lack of a context for judging what the West 
must do to respond constructively to change, rather than simply watching in 
wonder. It does not imply failure to acknowledge that there is no clear 
blueprint for the future: Too many imponderables must be dealt with before it 
is clear what new institutions and practices are needed for a new all-European 
security system. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is, of course, no Ronald Reagan. He is unlikely to engage in the sort of 
freewheeling discussions that stunned the allies following the December, 1986, 
Reykjavik summit. Nor does this meeting in the Mediterranean have the makings 
of another Yalta, whereby the superpowers alone decide the fate of the 
Continent. Yet if only for the sake of prudence, Bush would be wise to make a 
quick round of allied capitals -- London, Paris and Bonn -- before going to sea 
with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the American President must finally come to grips with what he 
styles "the vision thing." In process, that means expanding the Atlantic 
alliance's mandate, persuading the European Community to talk with the United 
States about political issues affecting Europe's future, and proposing an 
all-European forum to vet ideas about common security. In substance, it means 
presenting criteria for a new security system: What must happen in East 
European states, the nature of Soviet security interests, the long-term role 
the United States should play as a "European power" and how current 
arms-control efforts could, in time, transform NATO and the Warsaw Pact from 
military alliances to political instruments for change backed by residual 
military guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Both to spur the process and to give it focus, Bush should go further and gain 
allied agreement on a timetable for transforming the two military blocs. Given 
the pace of events and evolution in attitudes, the year 2000 would be an 
appropriate deadline. By then, the truth will be known about the Gorbachev 
revolution. If it continues, much will be possible; if it does not, at least 
Bush will have set a standard for Western actions. Either a new world will be 
emerge, or the alliance will have a solid political basis for preserving the 
one we have.

COUNCIL HEARS FRIENDS, FOES OF SDG&amp;E MERGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Council members listened patiently for more than two hours 
Thursday night as opponents and proponents of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's 
proposed merger with Southern California Edison explained their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's public hearing was one of five scheduled on the controversial 
matter. The council, which is trying to determine whether the city should 
oppose the merger, could vote at its Nov. 30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, more than 50 merger proponents, most of whom live outside the 
city's borders, reiterated the utilities' claim that the merger would bring 
lower rates and improved service to San Diego County residents. Many of the 
merger proponents wore badges provided by San Diegans for the Merger, a group 
with close ties to the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 merger opponents, many of whom belong to Utility Consumers Action 
Network, a local consumer group, repeated their oft-stated claim that electric 
rates and pollution would be increased by the merger. GREG JOHNSON

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR IN CORONADO BECOMES STYLISH 
ITALIAN RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The self-transformation of an old-fashioned neighborhood bar into a tony eatery 
isn't quite as surprising as would be, say, the sudden decision of a punk 
guitarist to devote his life to the study of Mozartian nuances, but it is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Harbor in Coronado for years was the kind of neighborhood place at 
which regulars traded tall tales over a couple of cold ones. But management 
switched off the neon beer signs at the beginning of the year and reopened in 
mid-summer as Primavera, an upscale, uptown kind of restaurant with a formal 
mood and an especially attractive decor. 
</P>
<P>
It is Italian, naturally -- most new restaurants seem to be Italian these days, 
and Coronado certainly was in need of a good one -- and the cooking generally 
ranges from satisfactory to rather nice. 
</P>
<P>
Primavera means springtime, but the word also connotes renewal, which neatly 
sums up the transformation of a clubby, casual hangout into an establishment 
with deep banquettes upholstered in floral print, a menu that includes bresaola 
and bagna cauda and a maitre d' who kisses women's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of dishes seems largely pan-Italian, with a certain degree of 
emphasis on preparations from the provinces of Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria 
-- which is to say, with great caution, that there is some Northern Italian 
cooking. The term is these days enormously overworked, misused and 
misunderstood, and applied scattershot by many of the restaurateurs who know 
that dishes specified as "Northern" have snob appeal. 
</P>
<P>
However, chef Luigi Tornatore (who cooked previously at Point Loma's unassuming 
but delightful Michelangelo), does come from the North, and his menu offers 
several good renditions of that region's specialties. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best of these is bagna cauda, or "hot bath," which is not mentioned 
by the menu but is available most days. Bagna cauda classically consists of 
olive oil and butter heated with anchovies and garlic, and is served as a 
fondue-like dip for bread and raw vegetables. Tornatore reverses the process by 
spooning a little of the mixture over a plate of grilled eggplant, slivered 
Parmesan and pungent sun-dried tomatoes, and the finished product ranks as a 
particularly elegant sort of antipasto. 
</P>
<P>
There is a similar elegance to the caprese al prosciutto, which dresses up the 
now-typical presentation of sliced tomatoes layered with fresh mozzarella and 
basil leaves by adding strips of delicate cured ham to the plate. The light 
drizzle of olive oil that moistens the arrangement adds a good bit of flavor. 
(A similar dish, in which red onion stands in for the prosciutto, is presented 
as a salad.) 
</P>
<P>
A third handsome appetizer, the bresaola con carciofini, pairs thin slices of 
the lovely, air-dried, cured beef called bresaola with baby artichokes, and it 
is indeed a luxurious combination. Other starters include the usual stuffed 
mushrooms and fried squid, and, less typically, a small filet of sole under a 
browned topping of Parmesan and white wine sauce. The minestrone seems done 
with a lighter hand than elsewhere, and the now almost ridiculously ubiquitous 
Caesar salad has a good, sharp bite to it. (The restaurant employs mustard in 
the dressing, which is against tradition and usually doesn't work, but the 
other ingredients are balanced around it and this is, in fact, an excellent 
salad.) 
</P>
<P>
The pasta list runs on rather enthusiastically with a roster of alternately 
creamy and pungent dishes, but pasta by and large does not seem the 
restaurant's strongest suit. The list begins, unsurprisingly, with fettuccine 
primavera, the classic tangle of ribbon noodles, assorted vegetables and light 
cream sauce. It then pauses at gnochetti (small dumplings) in a shrimp-flavored 
cream sauce before plunging into such rustic and theoretically robust offerings 
as the spicy penne alla puttanesca, the very pungent vermicelli aromatici (the 
sauce includes garlic, mixed herbs, capers and anchovies) and rigatoni al 
Gorgonzola, rich with the musty snap of that most regal, Italian blue cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The last two were sampled, and both seemed quite timid in their approach; the 
pasta used also was limp and flat-tasting, an unexpected circumstance in any 
Italian restaurant but especially in one of this pretension. More familiar 
choices include fettuccine alfredo, cannelloni, spinach lasagna and linguine in 
red and white clam sauces. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to pasta, the menu offers a couple of risotti, the often 
elaborate rice stews that are, in fact, a trademark of some Northern Italian 
cooking, especially that of Milan. The risotto pescatore decorates the rice 
with a variety of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Both seafoods and meats are, by and large, sauteed in the particularly 
satisfactory Italian manner that finishes them with a syrupy sauce of reduced 
pan juices and wine thickened with a bit of butter. Choices include scampi 
Primavera, or shrimp and mushrooms in an herbed wine sauce; sea bass livornese, 
which spices the sauce with capers and black olives; and chicken breasts and 
veal scallops finished in the Marsala, con melanzane (with eggplant) and 
Valdostana treatments. The chicken Valdostana was done with particular 
delicacy; a boned, lightly pounded breast was stuffed with prosciutto, sliced 
mushrooms and creamy Fontina cheese, dipped in flour and beaten egg, gilded in 
butter and moistened with the lightest of pan sauces. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers more steaks than usual -- perhaps because of the large number 
of conventioneers attracted by Coronado's resort hotels -- and dresses them 
variously with Cognac sauce, an herbal marinade and a topping of sauteed 
onions, mushrooms and peppers. The sole lamb listing, slices of herb-marinated 
loin, is grilled, and, although a portion sampled came off well enough, the 
advertised herbal flavor was disappointingly meek. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of daily specials usually complete the menu, but a highly touted 
lobster fra diavola was worth neither the kitchen's nor the diner's efforts, 
and it certainly was not worth the price. What should have been lobster cooked 
in a spicy tomato sauce was fresh lobster overcooked in a bland, chunky stew of 
tomatoes that had irritating bits of shell as one of its chief seasoners. This 
was served atop a great pile of overcooked, characterless fettuccine that 
should not have been allowed to pass through the kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert tray also needs a little attention. Its chief attraction, 
tirami-su, is turning up at so many ambitious Italian restaurants these days 
that a few alternatives from the vast Italian repertoire might find a 
surprisingly warm welcome. It is, however, a nicely composed dish (the English 
would call it a pudding) of liqueur-soaked ladyfingers topped with a sweetened 
mascarpone cheese and a heavy dusting of powdered chocolate.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense rested its case Thursday in the fraud and tax evasion trial of 
Nancy Hoover Hunter. Closing arguments in the lengthy trial will begin today 
and last three days. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter concluded her testimony Thursday after nine days on the witness stand in 
the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorneys are trying to prove that she was unaware of J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli's fraudulent activities, which led to 1,200 investors losing nearly 
$90 million when J. David &amp; Co. collapsed in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The defense claims that Hunter was blinded by love for Dominelli, with whom she 
shared a $2-million Rancho Santa Fe home, and could not see through the lies 
told to her by the convicted swindler and his close circle of associates.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm baaaack . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you remember me from the Herald Examiner, I hope you will continue to enjoy 
the column. To new readers of "Notes on a scorecard," a note or two of 
explanation. This is the buffet of sports columns. If an item isn't appetizing, 
proceed directly to the next. Variety will be the spice of this space four 
times weekly . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most of the notes are compiled from a press box seat at a sporting event or an 
easy chair in front of a television set. I'm a sportsaholic. Big events are my 
bag, but the best of any sport is worth commenting about. Well, maybe not the 
America's Cup . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine Waves are OK with me, but not the wave . . . 
</P>
<P>
I knew hockey before Gretzky or Bo. Boxing is still the sweetest of sciences. 
College sports are my favorites, but the pros run a close second. There's so 
much more to the ponies than merely the pari-mutuel windows. Give me UCLA vs. 
USC any time, whether it's hoops, debate or water polo . . . 
</P>
<P>
Consider yourself a true aficionado if you can name more than one horse in any 
Breeders' Cup race Saturday except the Classic. This year, it's six prelims and 
a main event. The MVH -- Most Valuable Horse -- should be Sunday Silence. He's 
won two of three from Easy Goer and is better on the road . . . 
</P>
<P>
More than 75,000 tickets have been sold for the Beach Boys and the pre-concert 
USC-Oregon State football game at the Coliseum Saturday. Record attendance for 
a Trojan-Beaver game in L.A. was 61,301 in 1947, when the Boys were toddlers . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Gate 6 Motel is located across from Gate 4 at Hollywood Park . . . 
</P>
<P>
Peter O'Malley should spend the anticipated profits from raising ticket prices 
by a buck each -- 3,000,000 fans would mean an extra $3 million -- on a 
contract for free-agent pitcher Mark Langston. Then trade either John Wetteland 
or Ramon Martinez for Red Sox center fielder Ellis Burks . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sharlene Hawkes, the former Miss America from Utah who hosts ESPN's "Scholastic 
Sports America," exudes star quality . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Raveling is conducting USC basketball practice at 6 a.m. daily in the 
campus gym and tardiness will not be tolerated. "Anybody who shows up later 
than 10 minutes to 6 gets kicked off the floor," says Early Bird George . . . 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas would have been a lottery pick 
if he had chosen to go directly from Odessa (Tex.) Junior College to the NBA . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Jimmy Carson trade makes the Great Gretzky deal look all that much better 
for the Kings . . . 
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever, all four major league commissioners -- Paul Tagliabue, 
Fay Vincent, David Stern and John Ziegler -- are lawyers . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's date: The NBA opener, Clippers vs. Rockets, at the Sports Arena. 
There's a new look in the Clippers' dressing room. Unfortunately, it's the 
room, not the players. It's twice the size of the old one . . . 
</P>
<P>
In an otherwise empty Sports Arena Tuesday night, Danny Manning and Elgin 
Baylor went at it for 90 minutes, one-on-one, halfcourt. Both looked primed for 
comebacks . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will dress four rookies tonight in Dallas. Three weren't drafted. 
The other, Vlade Divac, was drafted twice, by the Lakers and the Yugoslav army 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame should whip Navy Saturday if the Irish aren't caught looking ahead 
to next week's game against SMU . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've never seen a pump fake by a quarterback that didn't work . . . 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 Steelers upset the previously unbeaten '72 Dolphins, 21-20, in NFL 
Films' "Dream Bowl." So who beat the '78 Steelers for real? Houston and the 
Rams . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fight of the Year should be the Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor 
super-lightweight title bout March 17 in Las Vegas. No senior citizens allowed 
inside this ring . . . 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's two-point conversion rule makes for more exciting finishes than the 
NFL's overtime . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Walton is getting a bum rap in New York. It's the lack of playing talent, 
not coaching talent, that's ruining the Jets . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Cleveland has broken off contract talks with Joe Carter, the most 
talked-about trade possibility has him going to Kansas City for Danny 
Tartabull. San Diego and San Francisco also are preparing offers for the 
Indians' slugger . . . 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Stephen Greenberg as deputy commissioner of baseball may 
serve as an antidote to the feared strike of 1990. Who better than an ex-agent 
to understand labor's side? . . . 
</P>
<P>
As Nuke LaLoosh said in "Bull Durham," it's great to be in The Show . . .

TV-RADIO: NBC ADDS DENMAN, BUT IN WRONG ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, NBC is giving its Breeders' Cup coverage a little western flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita race caller Trevor Denman will be a member of the on-air crew 
working the 4 1/2-hour telecast Saturday from Florida's Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Denman will serve as an analyst focusing on the West Coast horses, and at least 
that's a stride in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
But Denman should be calling the races. That's what he does best. 
</P>
<P>
However, NBC insists on using Tom Durkin, the race caller at two East Coast 
tracks -- the Meadowlands in New Jersey and Hialeah in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Breeders' Cup, now in its sixth year, was held at Santa Anita in 
1986, Durkin was the race caller instead of Denman. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't set too well with the Santa Anita regulars, who like Denman because 
of his insightful, colorful and accurate calls. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC's Jim Healy, who follows horse racing with a hypercritical view, says: 
"Trevor Denman is not only the best race caller in the country, he is 10 times 
better than whoever is second." 
</P>
<P>
About his role on Saturday's telecast, Denman said: "Sure, I look at this as a 
good opportunity for me, but if I had my choice, I'd prefer calling the race. 
What I am is a race caller. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at this assignment is that it's great for California, not just 
great for Trevor Denman. We have some pretty good horses racing here, and now 
we're finally being represented." 
</P>
<P>
Denman, a South African, first came to the United States to call an 
international race in 1980 at Aqueduct in New York. He returned in the fall of 
1983 to call another race at Bay Meadows in San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
That race was on a Wednesday, and the next day he paid a visit to Santa Anita. 
He had written ahead to Race Director Frank E. (Jimmy) Kilroe, who invited 
Denman to sit in and call the ninth race. 
</P>
<P>
Denman returned to the track the next day and was invited to call another race. 
He then returned to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Alan Balch, then Santa Anita senior vice president in charge 
of marketing, called Denman in South Africa to offer him a job working the Oak 
Tree meeting after Alan Buchdahl left for Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Denman packed up and moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when Dave Johnson, the race caller during Santa Anita's main 
winter-spring meeting, left over a contract dispute, Denman got that job, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg and Tom Hammond will again be the hosts of NBC's Breeders' Cup 
coverage; Sharon Smith will return as an analyst, and Jenny Ornsteen, a 
newcomer, will be a roving reporter. Ornsteen is the co-host of a racing show 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Denman essentially replaces Harvey Pack, an East Coast handicapper who is the 
director of promotions for the New York Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's first five Breeders' Cup telecasts were four hours in length. Saturday's 
will be 4 1/2. It begins at 10:30 a.m., PST, with the first race, the Sprint, 
scheduled for about 10:55. 
</P>
<P>
NBC says the extra time will give the telecast some breathing room, allowing 
more features. 
</P>
<P>
These will include a tribute to Bill Shoemaker and a look at the career of 
Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Racetracks throughout the country, including Santa Anita, will carry NBC's 
coverage and wrap it around live races. 
</P>
<P>
NBC should set up Nielsen meters at the racetracks because the home viewing 
audience doesn't figure to be impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup once again has the misfortune of falling on one of the best 
college football Saturdays of the year, highlighted by No. 2-ranked Colorado 
vs. No. 3 Nebraska at 11:30 a.m., PST, on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, it's the game of the year," said commentator Pat Haden, who will 
work the game with Jim Nantz. "Call it Game of the Century, Part 27." 
</P>
<P>
In all, there will be 13 college games on television Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel has a couple of attractive ones. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., it will be Notre Dame against Navy. It may not be much of a game, 
but it's still Notre Dame, which probably will win its 21st in a row. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m., SportsChannel offers what should be a much better matchup -- the Big 
West showdown between Fresno State, currently on a 15-game winning streak, and 
San Jose State. This one, with Fresno State announcers Randy Rosenbloom and 
Mike Shumann reporting, could be the second-best game of the day. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today and Sunday, SportsChannel America, as part of the Breeders' Cup weekend, 
will televise races from Gulfstream Park, beginning at noon, PST, both days. 
SportsChannel will also preview and review Saturday's big races. . . . Showtime 
will televise Saturday night's Evander Holyfield-Alex Stewart fight at Atlantic 
City, N.J. The announcers will be Steve Albert, Marv's brother, and Ferdie 
Pacheco. The telecast begins at 7, PST, the fight about 7:15. . . . Rick Kulis 
of Choice Entertainment reports that sales for the Dec. 7 Roberto Duran-Sugar 
Ray Leonard fight at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas are going briskly. Most 
Southland cable companies are asking $39.95 but will charge $44.95 the day of 
the fight. The San Diego Cable Sports Network is offering a bargain price of 
$30 that will go to $35 on Dec. 4 and $40 the day of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Pro football on Sunday: The Rams at Minnesota on CBS at 10 a.m., PST, with Pat 
Summerall and John Madden; Pittsburgh at Denver on NBC at 1 p.m., with Marv 
Albert and Bob Trumpy, and Dallas at Washington on ESPN in the cable network's 
midseason opener at 5 p.m., with Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann. . . . It was 
good to hear the Summerall-Madden team on last Sunday's Ram-Chicago game. 
They're still the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, responding to pressure from fans and major league baseball, announced 
Thursday it will televise 16 regular-season baseball games next season, four 
more than originally planned. . . . The Florida-based Senior Professional 
Baseball Assn., a league featuring recently retired players, will make its 
debut on Prime Ticket tonight, delayed at 7:30. . . . Good news for Century 
Cable subscribers: The Los Angeles cable company added the TNT network just in 
time for the NBA season. . . . Channel 7's Jim Hill will emcee a motivational 
symposium featuring Pat Riley, Tom Lasorda and John Wooden at the Irvine Hilton 
Monday from noon to 4 p.m.

PACIFIC 10 RACE NARROWS TO THREE TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One by one, teams that were expected to contend for the Pacific 10 championship 
have fallen by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is out of it. So are Oregon and Washington. USC, the preseason favorite, 
is 4-0 in the conference, and Arizona (4-1) is the only remaining challenger 
unless Oregon State (3-1-1) upsets the Trojans Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
If USC wins and Arizona beats California at Berkeley Saturday, the probable 
championship showdown would be Nov. 11 in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is the only Pac-10 school that hasn't played in the Rose Bowl, and it 
hasn't been a contender this late in the season. In fact, the Wildcats' 4-1 
conference record is their best at this point of the season since the school 
joined the Pac-10 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
One would assume, considering the stakes, that Arizona would be looking ahead 
and have difficulty focusing on its game with Cal, 2-6 overall and 0-5 in the 
Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
But Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said it won't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have any trouble focusing on California," he said. "We remember very 
vividly that they beat us last year. The Cal game is a key to everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never played for first place this late in the year. We've never been 
4-1. We're trying to get to a new level so we can control our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona gained some stature by beating Oklahoma, 6-3, earlier in the season. 
Then the Wildcats routed UCLA, 42-7, on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
It was theorized at the time that Arizona surprised UCLA with a power-I 
formation, an offensive diversion from its standard wishbone formation. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that big of a deal," said Tomey, who had dispatched two of his 
assistant coaches to Boulder, Colo., the previous week to study the power-I 
option offense that has been so effective for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"The I-formation is so conventional. Everyone sees it all the time. So it 
wasn't a radical thing. We added only one new play and blocked for it the same 
as we do (in) the wishbone." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the Wildcats gained 480 yards rushing on the Bruins, the most 
UCLA has yielded on the ground since its inaugural game with USC in 1929, when 
the Trojans gained 753 yards rushing, still a conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Tomey has made another late-season adjustment -- replacing starting quarterback 
Ronald Veal with redshirt freshmen George Malauulu, formerly of Carson High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence in both quarterbacks," Tomey said. "We feel fortunate that 
we have two guys here who can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
And if Arizona does the job against Cal, it will reach an unfamiliar level. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Eight has been referred to as the Big Two because the conference has 
usually been dominated by Oklahoma and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Now Colorado has an opportunity to change the power structure when it plays 
Nebraska Saturday at Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The conference's other coaches slightly favor No. 2-ranked Colorado over No. 
3-ranked Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Some opinions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Iowa State's Jim Walden: "Nebraska has to throw the ball and they're not 
going to want to. They're a better throwing team than Oklahoma, but if you 
don't throw the ball on Colorado, they're going to beat you into submission 
because they've got as good a front seven as any team in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oklahoma State's Pat Jones: "My gut feeling is Colorado will win. We 
haven't played them yet, but I've seen them on film. I think they have the most 
talented team in the league, with height, weight and speed. It's not vintage 
Nebraska, but Nebraska knows how to win." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Missouri's Bob Stull: "They've both got good sets of running backs. I'd say 
Colorado's are faster and Nebraska's are a little stronger, more balanced. The 
striking thing about Colorado is team speed. They're very similar on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska is led by fifth-year senior Gerry Gdowski, while Colorado quarterback 
Darian Hagan is a good option runner who is also an accurate long passer. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "They're totally different types of athletes. Hagan is a quick guy, 
very explosive, who can make things happen. Gdowski is not that kind of 
quarterback, although he makes few mistakes and does a great job of taking 
advantage of the people around him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if Nebraska can contain Hagan, make him have a subpar game, then 
Nebraska will have a real chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
"Stagg Fears Purdue" was a famous headline in a Chicago newspaper many years 
ago when Amos Alonzo Stagg was coaching at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Update that headline to "Bo Fears Purdue." 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler, whose team has a 6-1 record and 
is 4-0 in the Big Ten, said he's nervous about a team that has lost six 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure if I get nervous, the kids will do the same things," said 
Schembechler, noting that Purdue scored 21 points against Michigan State in the 
last 6 1/2 minutes while losing, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
"An underdog will come in and let it all out. But it is how we think that will 
determine if we win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is a 35-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
If top-ranked Notre Dame remains unbeaten, it will probably play the winner of 
the Colorado-Nebraska game in the Orange Bowl Jan. 1 with the national 
championship possibly at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the logical thing right now if we remain unbeaten," said John Heisler, 
Notre Dame's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you believe Lou Holtz, the Irish might not even accept a bowl bid 
because the scheduling of final exams would make it difficult to prepare his 
team for a New Year's Day game. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Lou. Notre Dame will pass up a possible $4.1-million payday and the 
opportunity of repeating as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl, which has been the site of two national championship games in 
the past three years, hasn't despaired of a matchup involving Notre Dame.

NEW COMMISSIONER PLANS REORGANIZATION OF NFL FRONT OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The NFL changed so much in Pete Rozelle's 30 years as commissioner that it no 
longer resembles the league of 1960, said Paul Tagliabue, the new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1959, the last year before Rozelle, the 12 NFL teams generated $50 million 
in revenues," Tagliabue said from his law office. "This year, with 28 teams, 
revenues are over $1 billion. That's a different ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue predicted that the NFL is about to undergo a major reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the (NFL's) growth, there hasn't been that much change in the (league) 
staff in Pete's time," Tagliabue said. "As the league grew, he grew with it. 
But now, I think, some reorganizing is essential." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue says he will recommend installing two or three assistant 
commissioners, whose specific titles have yet to be determined. They will 
oversee the department heads. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plans follow some nervous moments during a long struggle to 
find a new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
When Rozelle resigned in March, everyone in the league office was given a 
year's notice. The thought behind that unusual course of action -- which was 
suggested by some of the club owners -- was that the new leader should have a 
free hand in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue is a long-time Rozelle associate who isn't planning wholesale 
changes, but some big ones nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"We need at least two senior management people (between the commissioner and 
the department heads)," Tagliabue said. "The NFL, as a venture, has two sides 
-- football and business. We should probably have a (deputy commissioner) for 
each -- and possibly another for marketing. We'll get the thinking of the 
(owners) and have it done by (next summer)." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Davis, a Hall of Fame football player who lives in Marina del Rey and 
works in Los Angeles, has been singled out by Tagliabue every time the new 
commissioner has spoken of the league's future. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he wants Davis in his administration and mentions his name first 
when discussing deputy commissioners. Davis, a former Green Bay Packer all-pro, 
is a successful businessman with a master's degree from the University of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a defensive end, is also one of the favorites of the owners on the two 
search panels that endorsed Tagliabue for commissioner. A second committee made 
Davis one of four finalists for the commissioners' job along with Jim Finks of 
New Orleans and Pat Barrett of Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other owners have been bothered by Davis' candor. He has a respect 
for the truth that surfaces when questioned in public. 
</P>
<P>
From his background as a former player and an enterprising businessman who owns 
a string of radio stations, Davis has indicated that some form of free agency 
is workable in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't insist on that. Over the years, he has proved to be an 
open-minded team player who would do his best in labor relations and in all 
other areas within the ground rules laid down by Tagliabue and the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Reorganization won't happen tomorrow, but Tagliabue is clearly on the right 
track in mentioning Davis as a potential deputy commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Finks, who was almost named commissioner, is reportedly under consideration for 
commissioner of the Canadian Football League, the organization with which he 
got his front-office start in pro football 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Finks, the president and general manager of the New Orleans Saints, said 
from Chicago this week that he wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going back to Canada," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals plan on trying a few tricks when they play the Raiders 
in the Coliseum Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche told reporters that the Bengals plan to use a quick-snap on 
offense, and get away with it if they can. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not violating anything until the official says, 'You didn't give (the 
defense) enough time," said Wyche, whose no-huddle offense has troubled 
opponents for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The quick snap takes the no-huddle to another dimension. 
</P>
<P>
If the defensive coaches try to send in substitutes while Cincinnati 
quarterback Boomer Esiason is calling signals at the line of scrimmage, the 
center snaps the ball, and the defense often is penalized for having 12 men on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Coach Bud Carson said, "It's just another way of taking advantage of 
the rules, in my opinion, and they do the best job in the world of that." 
</P>
<P>
In no-huddle situations, a new NFL rule gives the defense "a reasonable amount 
of time" to match the offense in specialists substituted. 
</P>
<P>
What's reasonable? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a judgment call," Wyche said. "We're going to leave it up to the 
officials to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we'll know (how far the Bengals can go) is to go ahead and snap 
the ball (and) see at what point they're going to call it back." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the officials may be as closely watched Sunday as Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, whose team is 0-8 in his first NFL season, says 
he's sorry that his backup quarterback, Steve Walsh, didn't stay at the 
University of Miami this year. 
</P>
<P>
"(Walsh) would be making a strong run for the (Heisman Trophy)," Johnson said. 
"(As a pro), he has struggled at times because of all the new players we've 
been using on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He is pressing a little, (but) he is still talented and has a great future in 
the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he sees a brighter future for his other rookie quarterback, Troy 
Aikman. But Aikman, who will be ready to play at Washington Sunday, has been 
out for a month with a broken left finger. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to see if (Aikman) is 100% healthy," Johnson said. "And we want to see 
if he is 100% into the offense performance-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson doesn't blame either quarterback for the 0-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of different receivers who've broken routes and dropped 
passes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boz update: Brian Bosworth, Seattle's $11-million flop at linebacker, also will 
be eligible to play Sunday when the Seahawks are at Kansas City. Bosworth has 
been out for a month with an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Seahawk Coach Chuck Knox, who didn't sound too interested in discussing 
Bosworth, said he will talk with the former Oklahoma player one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks' defense has been holding steady without Bosworth. But their 
offense has been in trouble -- for a reason different from why the Rams' 
offense has sputtered. The Rams (5-3) haven't been able to establish the run to 
set up the pass. The Seahawks (4-4) can't run because their pass offense has 
been inconsistent with quarterback Dave Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the defense from ganging up against one or the other, a team has to be 
able to both run well and pass well, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
"(On running downs), teams are playing different types of defenses this year 
(against Seattle) with eight- and nine-man fronts," the Seahawk coach said. 
"You just can't go and run the ball against fixed bayonets. So you've got to 
put it up."

LOYOLA TO OPEN SEASON AGAINST EXPERIENCED AUSTRALIAN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can a pack of Lions overcome the boys from Down Under? That will be answered 
when Loyola Marymount unofficially begins the basketball season Saturday night 
with an 8:30 exhibition game against the Australian National Team. 
</P>
<P>
It should be an interesting test for the Lions, who will play host to a 
seasoned team that has six Olympic veterans including forward Andrew Gaze, a 
star of Seton Hall's NCAA runner-up last spring. Gaze was a final roster cut by 
the Seattle SuperSonics this week. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's lineup features three seniors with pro aspirations of their own -- 
returning starters Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, all being counted on 
to continue to pace the Lions' explosive offense. The starting lineup will also 
include junior Per Stumer at center and, probably, speedy junior transfer Tony 
Walker at point guard, with guards Terrell Lowery, a sophomore, and Tom 
Peabody, a junior, quickly in off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will have a slightly different look than last season when they set 
collegiate records by averaging 112.5 points and scoring 181 points in one 
game. This season, the 6-foot-5 Kimble will be listed as forward and will be 
expected to add rebounding, though his forte remains the three-point jump shot. 
Gathers, who led the nation in rebounding last season, will play more of a true 
forward spot, with the husky Stumer spending more time in the pivot. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will also show new looks to their constant full-court press, hoping 
to be less vulnerable to the long pass. Coach Paul Westhead is also hoping for 
production from some of the big men. The most impressive in early scrimmages 
have been 6-10 senior Marcellus Lee and 6-9 sophomore Chris Knight, though both 
remain inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will continue to run at all opportunities and should be helped by the 
addition of Walker, who is adept at pushing the ball past defenses and dishing 
off to the open man. Lowery, a slithery guard who can shoot the three-pointer, 
and Peabody, a crowd favorite for his mad dashes and dives into the crowd, 
should be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian team is coached by Adrian Hurley, who led the Aussies to a 
fourth-place finish in the 1988 Olympics, that country's best showing ever. 
Along with the 6-7 Gaze, a noted three-point shooter, the team features guard 
Philip Smyth, a veteran of three Olympics; guard Damian Keogh and forward Brad 
Dalton, both veterans of the 1984 and '88 Olympics, and relative newcomers Mark 
Bradtke, a 6-10 center, and forward Robert Sibley, both members of the 1988 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of the Australian team are 25 or older, and 17-year-old center 
Anthony Ronaldson is the only teen-ager. Bradtke, 20, is the only other Aussie 
under 23. Bradtke is a whopping 253 pounds -- no shrimp off the barbie. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead has some familiarity with the Australian lineup, having recently 
toured Australia with a team of NBA veterans including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
With 11 lettermen, a healthy complement, a returning All-American in Gathers, 
the deepest team in Westhead's five seasons and the momentum of two straight 
NCAA Tournament appearances, the Lions and their followers enter the season 
with high expectations.

MONESTIME, HUMPHREY FLEE MONTANA, FIND A HOME AT MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home, home on the range . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. Mack Humphrey and Marc Monestime, a couple of suburbanites 
who headed for the hills for a chance to play big-time college football, never 
felt at home on the range lands of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the deer and the antelope play . . . 
</P>
<P>
They never conducted any field studies of the animals, but they had a hunch 
that the deer and antelope of Montana didn't find much time to play, not with 
everyone in the state constantly trying to shoot them. 
</P>
<P>
 Where seldom is heard a discouraging word . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At first, that might have been true. Monestime and Humphrey said that they 
loved the first few weeks of their lives in Missoula, which is hard west from 
the towns of Nimrod and Bearmouth and just a few miles south of the 
always-popular St. Ignatius National Bison Range. But after a while, often was 
heard a discouraging word. 
</P>
<P>
And the skies are not cloudy all day . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then how, the football players would like to know, would you explain those 
endless storms that swept across Idaho and roared into Montana, lashing 
Monestime and Humphrey with biting snow and rain? It is generally accepted that 
a foot of snow doesn't fall out of skies that are not cloudy all day. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll always remember Montana," Humphrey said. "But this is where Mark and I 
belong." 
</P>
<P>
They were, after all, at Thousand Oaks High, where Humphrey was a hard-hitting 
linebacker and his teammate and buddy Monestime set a Ventura County record for 
career rushing yardage. When they graduated after leading the Lancers to the 
1987 Coastal Conference championship, however, they had few offers to play 
college football. Nearby Moorpark College showed interest, but the pair had 
loftier goals. Mike Trevathan, a former Thousand Oaks wide receiver, was about 
to begin his junior season at Montana. He had made the adjustment easily and, 
pleased with Trevathan, Montana came calling for Monestime and Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
"We were both pretty excited," Monestime said. "We didn't know much about 
Montana, but it was Division I-AA football, and that's all we had to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Montana offered Monestime a scholarship. Humphrey made the team as a walk-on 
and was then given a scholarship. Suddenly, the world was rosy. Snowy and cold, 
but still rosy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the two played sparingly in 1988, their first season. Humphrey was 
seeing little action after being switched from linebacker to strong safety. 
Then, the coaches decided to switch to a run-and-shoot offense, which pretty 
much took Monestime out of the picture too. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't fit in anymore," Monestime said. "The offense had one fullback 
and about six receivers, and the fullback just blocked. I thought I could 
adjust, but I could see right away that I was being left out." 
</P>
<P>
The two met one night and decided it was time to leave. They had been at the 
university for only one semester, but that was enough. Winter was setting in 
and without football to concentrate on, the idea of spending the foulest months 
of the year in the Wild, Wild West suddenly didn't appeal to Monestime and 
Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
So they came home. And immediately called Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner and asked 
if there might still be a couple of places on the roster. They enrolled at 
Moorpark for the spring semester, were an instant hit in spring drills and 
earned positions on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Monestime and Humphrey are now key players on a Moorpark team that is 6-1. 
Monestime is the Raiders' second-leading rusher with 432 yards in 69 carries. 
Humphrey plays safety on a defense that has allowed only 55 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that they were basically homesick in Montana," Bittner said. "We 
recruited them out of high school, but Montana talked scholarship with them and 
we couldn't match that, so they went. But I'm glad they're back. They're both 
excellent players." 
</P>
<P>
Both players said they would never forget their brief visit to Montana. Just 
thinking about it, Humphrey said, makes his shoulder ache. "A teammate brought 
us all up to his parents' ranch about an hour out of Missoula," he said, "and 
during the day he asked us if we wanted to shoot some guns at targets. I had 
shot a .22 before, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal. He hands me the gun 
and doesn't say anything. I aim and pull the trigger, and the next thing I know 
I'm flying backward. It almost blew my shoulder off and knocked me back about 
10 feet. It was a 7-millimeter rifle, not a .22. 
</P>
<P>
"I look around and the whole team, all the Montana guys who grew up shooting 
these big guns, are laughing like wild men." 
</P>
<P>
Monestime, who laughed along with the others, was next. He had watched Humphrey 
hold the gun's stock much too lightly against his shoulder, resulting in the 
wood-on-shoulder impact from the gun's recoil that nearly knocked his friend 
into South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Monestime wasn't about to make the same silly mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"So I hold the gun real tight, like I'm strangling it," he said. "I've got it 
jammed up against my shoulder as tight as I can. And then I put my eye right up 
against the rifle scope, and BANG!" 
</P>
<P>
Monestime's next memory is of having one very painful eye. The scope slammed 
against his eye socket, cutting him and later causing it to swell. 
</P>
<P>
And, he recalls, the incident must have caused great alarm among his teammates, 
who by now had stopped laughing at Humphrey and were rolling on the dusty 
ground, clutching their sides in an obvious sympathetic response to Monestime's 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they had laughed loud when Mack shot the gun," Monestime said. "That 
was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Already initiated into the Montana gun club, the next offer they had was to 
join some teammates on a hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all these guys talked about," said Humphrey, who once listed "raising 
animals and training them" among his interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Deer, antelope, elk, anything really. Anything that moved, these guys hunted 
it. Sometimes, during the hunting season, that's all you'd hear. All day long 
it's 'elk this and elk that.' 
</P>
<P>
"But when they told us that sometimes they'd have to track an elk for seven 
hours over a mountain, that's when Marc and I told them no thanks. When they 
went hunting, we just stayed home and watched "Geraldo" on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Montana was nice while it lasted, but I think both of us are glad to be home."

CONTRERAS OVERCOMES BITTERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
OPPORTUNITY: HE QUIT AFTER HIS FATHER PUSHED HIM AND HIS COACH BENCHED HIM, BUT 
THE CHANNEL ISLANDS HIGH QUARTERBACK RETURNED IN TIME FOR HIS SENIOR YEAR. NOW 
THE RAIDERS ARE CHALLENGING FOR A PLAYOFF BERTH WITH THIS REBORN LEADER -- AND 
A-STUDENT -- AT THE CONTROLS.

<TEXT>
<P>
So Mark Contreras isn't a Division I quarterback. Or a Division II quarterback. 
He barely hung around long enough to be a starting high school quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
But Contreras is no longer filled with rage. The bitterness is mostly gone now. 
The scars of disappointment are easily covered by the quickest smile and 
brightest brown eyes you'll ever see. 
</P>
<P>
For it was Contreras, since childhood burdened with the responsibility of 
earning his keep by throwing the football, who had a safety valve all along. 
His considerable classroom ability, however, was overshadowed early on by his 
athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"From the fourth grade, I realized he had potential as a quarterback," Mark's 
father, Cal, says of his only son among five children. "I'm a middle-class 
person. I told Mark, 'The only way to go to college was to get a scholarship in 
football or baseball.' We had almost a blueprint of how it would go." 
</P>
<P>
You know the story, the one in which a certain redheaded robo-quarterback named 
Marinovich ransacks Tailback U. 
</P>
<P>
So Mark Contreras, his video camera-toting father never far from focus, went to 
work. Wearing hiking boots, he ran the beaches of Oxnard, not far from Santa 
Clara High, where he would one day lose a starting job to Tim Gutierrez. He 
tossed sideline patterns to family members on sandlot fields in Channel 
Islands, very close to Channel Islands High, where he would one day stand on 
the sideline, watching Vince Medina quarterback the Raiders. His Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
He pushed iron weights, further strengthening the wiry shoulders that would 
some day bear the load of all that had gone askew. 
</P>
<P>
Entering tonight's Marmonte League game against Camarillo, Contreras (5-foot-9, 
165 pounds) has passed for 781 yards and eight touchdowns for Channel Islands 
(4-3 overall, 2-2 in league play), averaging an impressive 18.6 yards a 
completion. He is a senior, in his third season as a varsity player, but his 
first as a full-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of finally owning the position he felt was rightfully his since the 
1987 season so overwhelmed Contreras last winter that he, well . . . he quit 
the team. Skipped the football banquet. Canned the game, his team and Coach 
Joel Gershon for good. He'd had enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The (1988) season ended and, to me, it was a big-time embarrassment," 
Contreras says. "To me, that was my senior year. I didn't show up at the 
banquet and I had a big fight with Coach Gershon about that. To him, that was 
like mocking the team. But, it was over. I didn't want to have anything to do 
with their program anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to be at that banquet. What are they going to say to me? This 
is our second-string quarterback for the second straight year? I was 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
But even more so, he was angry. And he was afraid. 
</P>
<P>
Angry, because he believes he didn't get a fair shot at Santa Clara, the school 
from which his father graduated in 1962 after playing for Lou Cvijanovich. He 
enrolled as a freshman at the small private school about the same time another 
freshman, Tim Gutierrez, did. Gutierrez (now 6-2, 195) went on to become a 
three-year starter and Ventura County's career passing leader. Contreras, 
feeling overlooked, moved on to Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Let's go to the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the footage, every practice," Cal Contreras says. "I've always said 
that my son had beaten Timmy out, but they said Timmy beat him out because he 
was taller. (Mark) would show, even in garbage detail, that he was better than 
Timmy." 
</P>
<P>
Angry, because he believes he didn't get a fair shot at Channel Islands, where 
he was ineligible for five games in his sophomore season as a result of the 
transfer. Vince Medina, who was a year older than Contreras, was dubbed the 
starter. Medina handled the position with adequacy -- if not flair -- for the 
better part of Contreras' sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras did get the occasional start as a sophomore, including a crucial 
late-season game against Thousand Oaks. The Raiders lost, 27-6. 
</P>
<P>
Roll 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was not Mark's fault," Cal Contreras says, "they blamed it on 
him and used it as an excuse to start Vince." 
</P>
<P>
Angry, because the next season, Medina once again had the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
Afraid, finally, because the blueprint, so meticulously prepared, had gone 
awry. "In a way, I was," Mark conceded. "I didn't have any experience playing. 
I was afraid. Come my senior year, I didn't even know anything about what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Gershon, the head coach, and Frank Gankas, the quarterback coach with whom 
Contreras had spent so many early-morning hours in the Channel Islands' weight 
room, let him go in hopes he would return on his own. Shawn Young, the Raiders' 
leading receiver, considered transferring to Santa Clara rather than face the 
prospect of running routes for anyone other than his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a young man with a lot of aspirations and desires," Gershon says of 
Contreras, "so his waiting period was frustrating. He has a lot of pride in 
himself and his performance. I'd like 60 guys who believe they should be first 
string. I think that's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Contreras, however, had grown sick of it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably his worst time, emotionally," Young says. "I tried to beg 
him -- 'C'mon man, one more year.' What he had been through, I understood. He 
was not going to play, no way." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the midst of spring, while the team -- his team -- was assembling for 
early afternoon practices, Contreras found inspiration in the most curious of 
places. It was at a musty gym in Oxnard -- away from Santa Clara, away from 
Channel Islands, away from the bright lights and the video camera. 
</P>
<P>
The man, he thought, was from the Midwest. Ohio, he vaguely remembered the guy 
saying. He, too, was a former quarterback. He, too, had missed his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me he'd give anything to go back and play that last year," 
Contreras says. "He was telling me you'll really miss it. That you'll miss out 
on a lot of experiences you'd never forget." 
</P>
<P>
On the final day of spring practice, Mark Contreras walked back onto the 
football field. Channel Islands needs to win tonight and next week against 
Royal to assure itself of a berth in the Division II playoffs, and the Raiders 
need Contreras to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's ability lies in a good sense of the game," Gankas said. "He reads the 
secondary. We don't have to do a lot of learning and teaching with him. He 
picks things up so quick." 
</P>
<P>
As astute as he is on the football field, he has been that much more so in the 
classrooms of Santa Clara and Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
And all along, right there, tucked somewhere between the ever-blitzing 
pressures to achieve and the fly pattern to excel, was his sure-handed safety 
valve. 
</P>
<P>
Friday nights he's the son of an armchair coach, but by day Contreras is the 
son of an English teacher: Cal teaches at Santa Paula High. Mark carries a 3.7 
grade-point average and has scored well on college entrance examinations. For 
Contreras, as it turns out, college will come as a result of studying textbooks 
rather than secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
Maturity came the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"When I didn't start those two years, that was a big thing," he says. "That was 
like somebody telling me I wasn't going to go to college. . . . but I still 
have that thing in my head from my father -- you've got to do it, you've got to 
do it. Now, I've grown up and realized that I can still go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"For so long, I wanted to hate Gershon. I looked for opportunities to tell a 
reporter, 'this guy is screwing me over,' you know? But, he hasn't screwed me 
over. He's given me an opportunity and given me a lot of experiences to grow 
on. Just being around him and his program is going to be with me for the rest 
of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned how to work hard. Dedication. He's given me a chance to learn." 
</P>
<P>
The pressures are mostly gone now. The video library still grows with every 
game, but not with the same sense of urgency. Cal Contreras no longer needs to 
sell his son. His son has sold himself -- his own way. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday," Cal muses, "we'll drink beer and watch old movies."

CRESCENTA VALLEY'S SPIRITED DEFENSIVE EFFORT WASTED, 21-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an outstanding defensive effort, Crescenta Valley High failed in its 
bid to guarantee itself a playoff berth Thursday night, falling, 21-0, to Muir 
in a Pacific League game at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, ranked fifth in Division II, capitalized on a long pass, a short drive 
and a Crescenta Valley miscue to dispose of the undersized Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang defense also clamped down, intercepting four passes by Ryan Kadletz 
and holding Crescenta Valley to 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense was just too big and fast for our offense," said Falcon Coach 
Jim Beckenhauer, whose team held Muir to 232 yards. 
</P>
<P>
If Crescenta Valley (6-3, 2-2) loses to first-place Arcadia next week, the odds 
of the Falcons making the postseason will be long. 
</P>
<P>
With less than two minutes expired in the fourth quarter, Dustin Benedict 
scooped up an errant lateral and ran for a 45-yard score. Sedric Thomas, who 
led all rushers with 32 yards in six carries, hit Elic Mahone on a conversion 
pass to widen the lead to 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict, who barely had to break stride, was as stunned as anyone when the 
ball bounced into his hands. "The back was gone so I just took off," he said. 
"I just turned around and there was the ball. Just me and the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Muir (7-1-1, 3-1), which had a 7-0 advantage at intermission, moved 38 yards on 
its first possession of the second half and capped the seven-play drive with a 
three-yard touchdown run by Carlton Greer. Eric Steinlight blocked the 
extra-point attempt and Muir settled for a 13-0 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley was unable to capitalize on four Muir fumbles in the first 
half but the Falcons limited the ordinarily explosive Muir offense to 124 yards 
-- 91 through the air. 
</P>
<P>
While the Falcons' defense flourished, their offense floundered: Crescenta 
Valley was held to just nine yards in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Mustangs' passing yardage came with 9:33 to play in the half when 
Thomas found Demetrius Martin wide open on a streak for a 50-yard touchdown. 
Todd Elkins added the extra point to give Muir a 7-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
On Muir's ensuing possession, Crescenta Valley linebacker Greg Thran stripped 
the ball from Sam Williford and recovered the fumble at the Mustang 41. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' opportunity to even the score fizzled on the following play, 
however, when a screen pass was batted by running back Jason Schwaiger and 
intercepted by Cassius Conway. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley's Mike Parker jumped on a fumble -- his second recovery of the 
game -- midway through the first quarter at the Muir 19. The Mustang defense 
did not budge and Damon Martin missed wide on a 31-yard field-goal try.

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo will play at Cal State Dominguez Hills in a California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. soccer match at 1 p.m. on Saturday because of a 
scheduling conflict between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo and the CCAA had reported that the match would be played today. 
</P>

EARLY RESULTS OF SAND BASS TAGGING PROJECT ENCOURAGING TO FISH &amp; GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of the year's first migrating sand bass tag-and-release program are 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year scientific study was launched on Capt. Russ Izor's boat, the First 
String, during five trips from June to August. 
</P>
<P>
Mac Oliphant, sportfishing biologist with the State Department of Fish and Game 
who heads the tagging project, said important information is being gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Oliphant said 730 bass were tagged and released. Twenty-three tags have been 
recovered. The fish traveled 10 miles in about 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the returned tags had marine growth, which he plans to study further. 
</P>
<P>
The question still to be answered is where the fish disappear after spawning 
along sandy beaches from Huntington Beach to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Izor is planning to organize teams of 10 next year to board boats from 
Oceanside to Santa Monica to expand the tagging operation, with Oliphant 
keeping the data from each trip. 
</P>
<P>
Izor said the First String will be available for the South Bay portion of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers catching any species of fish with a tag are urged to tell Fish and Game 
in Long Beach when and where the fish were caught. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Redondo Beach fisherman Clyde Rainwater just returned from Loreto, Baja 
California, where he said he had one of the best fishing trips of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He caught a sailfish that weighed 120 pounds and a dorado that weighed 38 
pounds. In addition, he landed yellowtail and cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
Three San Pedro anglers on a one-day albacore trip aboard the Producer returned 
early Tuesday with an excellent catch: Don Hansen decked a 30-pound bluefin, 
and Guy Calafeno and Larry Betencourt caught 28- and 29-pound tuna. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Greg Luehmann of Torrance, on a two-day tuna trip aboard the Sharpshooter, 
caught the whopper of the week when he brought to gaff a 50-pound yellowfin 
tuna. Louis Robinson of Rolling Hills, fishing aboard the Daiwa, hit the 
jackpot with a 31-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Davis of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the China Clipper, caught a 
28-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Porter of Torrance has won the jackpot two weeks straight aboard the 
Redondo Special. Last weekend he caught a 22-pound yellowtail and the previous 
week a big white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Luna of Long Beach, on the Pacifica at San Clemente Island, caught a 
22-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Wang, on a half-day trip aboard the Happyman, caught a 21 1/2-pound 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kinkel of West Los Angeles, aboard the Spitfire, caught a 16 1/2-pound 
halibut.

DOMINGUEZ DRAWS RUGGED SOCCER FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second-ranked Cal State Dominguez Hills will play fourth-rated Keene State of 
New Hampshire on Nov. 11 in the opening game of the NCAA Division II Women's 
Soccer Championships at Barry College in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Only four teams, one from each NCAA geographic area, advance to the 
championships. The winner between Dominguez Hills (18-2) and Keene (13-3-2) 
will play the winner between host Barry (15-0-2) and Adelphi University of New 
York (8-6-1) for the national title Nov. 12. Barry is ranked No. 1 and Adelphi 
is ranked 6th. 
</P>
<P>
Keene is very physical, a non-stop team and well-coached, said Dominguez Hills 
Coach Marine Cano. "We will have to force them to make key mistakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Dominguez Hills losses were to UC Santa Barbara, a Division I team.

YUGOSLAVS' OWNER TO HEAD GREATER L.A. SOCCER LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gabriel Cucuk of Rancho Palos Verdes has been elected president of the Greater 
Los Angeles Soccer League. Cucuk, owner of the San Pedro Yugoslavs, replaces 
Tony Morejon, who has served for eight years. Cucuk's term is four years. 
</P>
<P>
Morejon was retained as an administrator and consultant to the league, which 
opens its 87th season Nov. 11 at Daniels Field in San Pedro. Cucuk, a machine 
shop operator, plans to create a league all-star team that will play 
international touring teams when they swing through Southern California. 
Interviewed last year, Cucuk told The Times that he was looking for a role to 
play in helping the United States prepare to play host to the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
One of the requirements for the United States to get the World Cup was that it 
establish a professional soccer league of its own. Cucuk said he can foresee 
the Greater L.A. Soccer League taking advantage of that atmosphere. He said he 
hopes the league can play statewide competition. 
</P>

Ascot Raceway begins its final month of the 1989 campaign with CMC Nationals 
tonight at 7:30, followed by the CRA Series for sprint cars Saturday night at 
8. Only three CRA events remain. Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., has a 51-point 
lead over Jerry Meyer of Chino and a 97-point lead over Rip Williams of Yorba 
Linda. Mike Sweeney of Carson is stuck in sixth place with very little room to 
move up or down. Mike Kirby of Redondo Beach, once as high as sixth, has 
dropped to 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt Enterprises of Redondo Beach has folded its racing division, but owner 
Jeff Babbitt said last week that he plans to have a car ready for the final 
three weeks.

SOCCER: THE RECORDS AND 16 SHUTOUTS WILL BE FORGOTTEN IF UCSD RETURNS WITHOUT 
THE DIVISION III WOMEN'S TITLE. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Above the fireplace in their campus apartment hang two cardboard posters, 
hardly coveted artwork but pieces that manage to heat up the apartment's 
inhabitants faster than the fire below them. 
</P>
<P>
Four UC San Diego women's soccer teammates live here. The posters are daily 
reminders of the team's unity and commitment, which will be tested when the 
top-ranked Tritons open the NCAA Division III Western Regional playoffs 
Saturday in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
According to two-time All-American Heather Mauro, the team made a pact when 
training began in August to abstain from drinking alcohol during October and 
through playoffs. To seal the promise, they signed a contract that was enlarged 
and now hangs over the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year Jen (teammate Jennifer Kingsbury) and I did it," Mauro said. "This 
year everyone decided to do it as a symbol of unity. It's not that we drink 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
The other hanging memento is a composite season schedule: "The Road to the 
National Championship." On it, USD's 15-1-1 season -- which includes 16 
shutouts -- is chronicled. Only four blanks -- the most post-season games they 
would play -- remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Our one goal is the national championship," Mauro said. "The shutouts are 
nice, but the championship, that's what our only focus has been. We've been 
training hard for three months for this. A lot of us feel our season starts 
Saturday. Everything else is what got us here." 
</P>
<P>
Said USDHS graduate Felicia Faro: "The season's been great, but basically it's 
been a warm-up for what we really want." 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Geneva, N.Y., UCSD was 20-0-2 with 18 shutouts going into the 
championship against William Smith College. The Triton's forced two overtimes 
before losing in sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
"It just slipped away," Mauro said. "We're not going to let that happen this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Not if Coach Brian McManus has his way. In three years at UCSD, McManus has 
compiled a 49-7-4 record and a trio of frustrating return trips from 
post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
"After last year's loss in the final," he said, "we sat down and set the 
target. We knew we'd be back. That was their first time in a championship game. 
They learned something." 
</P>
<P>
Something in the form of playoff experience for which there is no substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see them falling apart," McManus said. "Even if one or two are having 
a bad game, there are nine others who will carry them through. They have all 
the skill and will in the world to win it." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of it will come from seven seniors who have been playing together 
since they were freshmen. Roommates Mauro, Kingsbury, Faro and Teresa Schwaar 
and Julie Friess, Sheila Takahashi and Toni Krumme all were starters for UCSD 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They form a core that McManus said is vital to the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have players who understand each other like that, they don't need 
coaching," McManus said. "They make me look good." 
</P>
<P>
Faro, the team's second-leading scorer (16 goals), said playing together for so 
long has given the players a comforting confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel we just have to walk out on the field, but the nerves are a 
different kind of nerves," she said. "It's played a vital role, especially in 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mauro: "We work real well together on the field. It's almost like we read 
each others' minds. We know each other so well. Someone will pass and 
automatically know where that other person will be." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Mauro can be found tormenting defenders and goalkeepers near the 
penalty box. She scored 18 goals in 1987 for a school record, only to have it 
broken last year by sophomore Katy Dulock (21). Mauro scored 23 this season to 
get back her record, and her 47 goals in three years make her the school's 
all-time career leader. 
</P>
<P>
"No one bothers about records," Mauro said. "They don't mean a thing if we 
don't win the championship. Besides, I couldn't have scored all those goals 
without everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Friess, the goalkeeper, knows all about records. Her 46 shutouts are a career 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for everyone else, forget it," Friess said. "My defense is 
incredible. Over the years, we've developed into such a complete team." 
</P>
<P>
But she is ready to complete her career on a winning note. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready for this to be my last game," she said. "I want to go out with a 
bang. People are telling us not to come home without (the title)." 
</P>
<P>
Should they fail, many team members feel the puzzle would be left without its 
biggest piece. 
</P>
<P>
"I would feel I had four great years, but there would be something missing," 
Faro said. "I'd be lost in the sense that I've never wanted anything so much." 
</P>
<P>
Said Friess: "It would be such a big void." 
</P>
<P>
Mauro said a title would give her reason enough to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep saying that if we win, that's my last game," she said. "That's how I 
want to remember it."

Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh already has as many reasons as he does two-way 
players (11) to smile about the accomplishments of his football team. 
</P>
<P>
Against preseason speculation that had the unranked Buccaneers finishing 
somewhere near or at the bottom of the City Western League standings, Mission 
Bay (7-1) has played to its first winning season since 1975 (when it was 5-4), 
assured itself of its first playoff berth since 1974 and scored more points 
(179) than have been scored against it for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the talk is kind. Are long-suffering Mission Bay fans enjoying a 
winning season because of -- or in spite of -- the team's talent? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people still think we're a fluke," Pugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7 against Kearny at Mesa College, the Buccaneers will test their No. 
1 defense (5.4 points-against average) against Kearny (also 7-1) for the league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"A win here would be nice," Pugh said. "This is our 'finally-get-some-respect' 
game. But we want to win. This is not just for respect. We've played in a lot 
of supposed mismatches, and we've come through those." 
</P>
<P>
Kearny Coach Willie Matson is pleased with Mission Bay's new-found success. 
Matson and Pugh formed a strong friendship when Pugh was an assistant under 
Matson at Mission Bay for the 1984 and 1985 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish them all the luck in the world," Matson said, "except when they play 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Kearny, with a 34-1 series lead, seems to have the clear edge. The only time a 
Mission Bay team defeated Kearny was in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to make it two," Pugh said. "We figure beating them twice in 35 
years is about right." 
</P>
<P>
Pugh knows Mission Bay has its work cut out. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent wise, they're the best in the league, no doubt about it, " he said. "We 
can't make many mistakes, and we don't want to turn the ball over." But the 
key, he said, is that "we can't let them get out to a big lead." 
</P>
<P>
With quarterback Tommy Rawlins -- fourth in county passing with a 
185.4-yards-per-game average -- Kearny established itself primarily as a 
throwing team, but Matson said double coverage on his receivers forced the 
Komets to gear up their ground game. 
</P>
<P>
"The last four weeks we've been averaging 200 yards on the ground," Matson 
said. "We're pleased to see the offense diversify. Any one-dimensional team is 
beatable." 
</P>
<P>
But Mission Bay, with its thin roster, has been multidimensional from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of players with lots of abilities," Pugh said. "(Pat) Betancourt 
is a running back, wide receiver and safety. He's always pooped after the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Matson: "We have to stop their run game. Then we'll be OK. And I'm always 
concerned about mistakes. We just can't do that."

DAVIS SAYS NO TO OFFER BY PADRES 
</P>

<P>
Mark Davis has rejected the Padres' latest contract offer, agent Alan Hendricks 
said Thursday, and is considering delaying any decision until at least Nov. 14, 
when all major league teams are allowed to enter the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little concerned that they'll wait because they want to see what's 
really out there," said Fred Lane, the attorney who is handling the 
negotiations for the Padres with attorney Beth Benes. "But there's not much we 
can do right now. The ball's in their court. We're waiting for a proposal from 
them. We're not going to bid against ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have made two offers to Davis, the latest on Tuesday for what 
sources say is a three-year guaranteed contract for about $7 million. The only 
counter-offer was made weeks ago, and Lane described it as "a truly ridiculous 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we exchanged figures," Lane said, "but they still haven't 
come back with a reasonable offer. I just have a hunch they'll test the 
free-agent market, and until they do, they really can't come back with a 
figure." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who led the big leagues with 44 saves this past season as the Padres' 
bullpen stopper, filed for free-agency Monday but must wait a mandatory 15 days 
before negotiating or signing with another club. In the meantime, Davis and 
Hendricks can only talk with teams other than the Padres to determine interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We might negotiate with the Padres again (before Nov. 14), or we might not," 
Hendricks said from his Houston office. "We're just going to have to wait and 
see. It's not productive for Mark, for the Padres, for us, or for other teams 
to tell you what we're going to do. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is we are not going to accept the Padres' latest offer, and 
if nothing is resolved by Nov. 13, we'll be on the phone at noon Central 
Standard Time (the next day) talking to all other teams." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, of course, would like to finalize negotiations with Davis as 
quickly as possible so that they can immediately delve into the free-agent 
market and pursue left-handed starter Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Lane telephoned Arn Tellem, Langston's agent, on Thursday, and they agreed to 
begin negotiations in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre front office examined the rest of the free-agent marketplace Thursday 
and said that they might also pursue one of the available center fielders, such 
as Mookie Wilson of Toronto and Kevin Bass of Houston. But first, they will 
explore trade possibilities with the Cleveland Indians for center fielder Joe 
Carter and with the Boston Red Sox for Ellis Burks. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also decided that they likely will leave Jack Clark at first base, 
abandoning any efforts to pursue free-agent first baseman Keith Hernandez.

CLOTHESLINES: SHRUG OFF THE FUR TRIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYLOU LUTHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Are fur-trimmed coats fashionable now? I have an old sable shrug that 
could become the collar and cuffs on a cloth coat, but I hate to go to the 
expense if the look is dated. 
</P>
<P>
H.I. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Fur collars and cuffs are not exactly the last work in coats, but fur 
sleeves are. How about taking a page from Paris designer Christian Lacroix's 
sketchbook and converting your shrug to sleeves, as illustrated here?

LISTEN: STILL REIGNING SPECTACULARLY

<P>
About 1,000 fans gathered in the cosmetics department of the Broadway in 
Glendale to greet the woman who for nearly a decade played TV's queen of mean, 
Alexis Carrington Colby on the canceled classic, "Dynasty." Anxious to attract 
the same fans who were glued to the weekly soap, Joan Collins took the 
Bloomingdale's -- Macy's -- Broadway route to market Spectacular, the $150 
perfume and $38.50 eau de toilette she describes as an"old-fashioned, 
glamourous floral." No newcomer to the retail scene, the actress has signed her 
name to jewelry and lingerie collections that she says are a hit in London, 
while her signature eyeglass collection continues to sell here. She's already 
planning a skin-care line that will debut sometime next year. And Listen 
predicts Collins may be the first celebrity to create a collection of 
signature-scents in the not-too-distant future. Although she's married to 
Spectacular now, she admits, "I've never been faithful to one fragrance." 
</P>
<P>
Foundation of a Career 
</P>
<P>
Long before Zsa Zsa got into her recent, er, trouble with the law, she was an 
upstanding member of the acting community. Part of what provided the foundation 
for her career will be featured in the new Lingerie Museum, opening Nov. 8 in 
Frederick's of Hollywood's landmark store on Hollywood Boulevard. Gabor has 
donated the black lace bra and matching panty that she wore in the 1953 film 
"Lili," in which she played a carnival magician's assistant. Also featured will 
be Ava Gardner's petticoat from "Show Boat"; a white chiffon peignoir trimmed 
with white ostrich feathers worn by Mae West in a 1952 Life magazine spread, 
and a tasseled bustier sported by Madonna. The lingerie display, a permanent 
replacement for Frederick's short-lived Bra Museum, will feature vintage 
undergarments made by the 43-year-old company as well as celebrities' donations 
and items purchased from estates and private collections. Special guest at the 
opening will be Milton Berle, "because he's a Hollywood legend just like we 
are," a Frederick's spokeswoman told Listen. Uncle Miltie, after all, donned 
many an interesting underthing back in those early days of TV. ()

A Stone's Throw Into Fashion 
</P>
<P>
When the Stones rolled out of town after their recent concerts here, they had 
plenty of Los Angeles fashion labels in their luggage, thanks to a preconcert 
tour shopping spree by phone and fax machine. Mick Jagger placed an order with 
designers Maggie Barry and Stephen Walker of Van Buren, who made him two pair 
of Spandex leggings, one with a leather overlay of the tour's Steel Wheel logo 
on the leg, the other with a cobalt-blue racing stripe. For guitarist Ron Wood, 
Los Angeles jewelry and metal accessories designer Michael Schmidt custom-made 
a pair of chain-mail suspenders covered with colorful plastic to avoid 
scratching Wood's guitar. And Los Angeles menswear designer Henry Duarte for 
Sqwear says he did fashion fittings by Federal Express when he made two 
checkered vests with matching pants for Charlie Watts, the drummer.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DON'T BURDEN SON WITH GUILT TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr Joyce Brothers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 8-year-old son is going to spend several weeks with my 
ex-husband and his wife. This will be the first time this has happened since 
our divorce and I'm depressed and frightened by the prospect. I'm wondering how 
he'll adjust and if there's anything I can do to help him. 
</P>
<P>
F.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.W.: Try not to cry or complain about how sorry you are to see your son 
leave. This will make him depressed and he will be apt to feel guilty if he 
enjoys himself. An 8-year-old, and even children much younger, can worry about 
leaving their parents, especially boys who may feel that they're supposed to be 
responsible for their mother's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, all single parents need to stress that their children shouldn't 
worry about the parents' moods, nor should they feel responsible for making 
them happy. When single parents ignore this, they are burdening their 
youngsters unfairly and this will have unfortunate repercussions later. 
</P>
<P>
Children who switch between parents adjust more easily if the divorced parents 
have managed to respect each other's feelings and don't have a lot of 
unresolved conflicts. Children may try to test parents by questioning and 
comparing discipline. Divorced parents need to back each other up with house 
rules spelled out in advance. It's a good idea to go with your child to select 
a small gift that he might take to his father. This will let him know that it's 
all right to enjoy himself and that he won't have to feel disloyal when he 
does. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My daughter is in love with a nice young man but is afraid 
of marrying him because she thinks marriages inevitably fail. I realize part of 
this is because, unfortunately, both my marriages have ended in divorce. Is 
there anything I can do to help give her a more positive view of matrimony? 
</P>
<P>
T.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR T.S.: It would be unwise to try to push her into a marriage until she is 
ready. Her cynical attitude about marriage isn't unusual in children who've 
experienced divorce firsthand. There are some recent statistics that might help 
to allay her fears, however. 
</P>
<P>
While disenchantment plagues young working wives who are trying to juggle jobs 
and demands of parenting and homemaking, sociologist Andrew Greeley gives 
marriage high marks. He reports that, despite the difficulties of young working 
wives, the most unhappy Americans are women who haven't yet married or those 
who've separated or divorced and haven't remarried. 
</P>
<P>
So it seems that married women, even with their problems, "are still better off 
on the average in terms of 'happiness' than their sisters who haven't married 
or who are separated or divorced and not remarried." 
</P>
<P>
More goods news from the National Opinion Research Center: Not only are fewer 
marriages ending, but married people -- close to two-thirds of them -- report 
they are "very happy." Most married couples have few regrets. About 85% say 
they would remarry their spouse if they had it to do over again.

THE DRUG CLINIC: CO-DEPENDENTS NEED HELP, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOSEPH A. PURSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Books on co-dependency are selling by the millions. Why? Because everybody has 
this problem to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
In its extreme form, co-dependency means, for example, that John, the 
alcoholic, is addicted to drinking alcohol; and Mary, the co-dependent, is 
addicted to "helping" John (with his drinking and living problems). It also 
means that if their sick relationship ends -- for whatever reason -- John will 
find another Mary to "help" him; and Mary will find another John (alcoholic, 
drug addict, gambler, workaholic, etc.) so that she can fulfill her need to 
help as well as continue to suffer, blame, control, be the responsible one, 
hold their lives together and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Co-dependents rationalize and deny that their own behavior is sick, but 
everybody around them knows it is. The best way to treat co-dependents is in 
group therapy with alcoholics, addicts and other co-dependents. 
</P>
<P>
But today, co-dependents can do something about it. Reading a self-help book is 
a good start.

CALARTS MUSIC FESTIVAL TO BRING AUDIENCES EAR-TO-EAR WITH THE UNEXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Musicians will seat themselves before contraptions with names such as the 
Roland D-10 Digital Sampler and the Akai S 700 MIDI. Electronic sounds will 
fill the air, mixed with carefully timed recordings of cars honking and crowd 
noises. 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds like music for Future Shock, it is. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual SCREAM Festival at CalArts on Saturday will be a rare forum 
for electroacoustic composers who write new types of music both for traditional 
instruments and burgeoning electronic technology such as computers and MIDI 
keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs is a largely ignored world of composition that lies someplace beyond the 
environs of the Hollywood Bowl and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
"People are used to certain kinds of expectations, both in terms of the 
performance situation and the music they're hearing. All of us grow comfortable 
with the norm," said Barry Schrader, a professor at CalArts in Valencia and 
director of this year's daylong festival. "When you're dealing with things in 
contemporary electroacoustic music, you very well might come face-to-face with 
the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's part of the adventure of art." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader founded SCREAM (Southern California Resource for Electro-Acoustic 
Music) four years ago because he wanted some sort of organization for 
contemporary composers who don't have many outlets for their talents. 
</P>
<P>
He rounded up professors from USC, UCLA, Harbor College and Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and Cal State Northridge. In 1986, the groups began presenting an annual 
festival at various sites to coincide with American Music Week. 
</P>
<P>
This year's gathering at CalArts will offer prerecorded, pre-programmed music 
and live performances. Also -- in keeping with CalArts' eclectic tradition -- 
the festival will include dance performances, video presentations and an 
installation artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd take advantage of the people and facilities that are here," 
Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
The music will range from Roger Bourland's "Portable Concerto No. 2 for Flute 
and Tape," a more traditional piece, to Craig Naylor's "Hokshichankiya," a 
tribute to the Sioux Indians that is composed entirely of recorded animal 
noises -- wolves, coyotes, various owls, crickets and red-tailed hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Acclaimed pianist Dolores Stevens will perform, as will the California E.A.R. 
Unit, one of the most recognized new-music ensembles in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Four dance performances will be set to new forms of music, as will several of 
the video presentations. Among the videos will be Reynold Weidenaar's sound and 
video tribute to the "heavy stone architecture" and "spidery structural steel' 
of the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this will be enormously different from what most people are used to . 
. . probably a lot of it will be enormously different," Schrader said. "The 
reason I started this festival was to put the spotlight on people who have been 
lost in the shuffle of traditional performances." 
</P>
<P>
 The SCREAM Festival will be held from 1 to 7 p.m. Saturday at CalArts, 24700 
McBean Parkway, Valencia. The installation art and some music performances are 
free. Tickets for other performances are $6 and $3 for students and seniors. 
All-day passes cost $15, $7.50 for students and seniors. For information or 
reservations, call (805) 253-7800.

THE 'SIMPLER TIME' AT DRAGONWOOD FAIRE IS ALSO A LOT STRANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY, Mackey is a Granada Hills free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Gable adjusted his suit of armor and surveyed the knights, damsels, 
Scottish pixies and strolling minstrels in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a simpler time," Gable said about the medieval scene last weekend at 
Castaic Lake Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
From the looks of the Dragonwood Faire, which will close after this weekend, it 
also was a stranger time. Unlike the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, which has 
16th-Century England as its theme, the focus of Dragonwood is the pre-gunpowder 
era of 12th-Century Ireland and Britain. Fair promoters are billing the 
attraction, which pulled in about 8,000 visitors last weekend, as a medieval 
fantasy fair. 
</P>
<P>
According to Christine Dzilvelis, the 12th Century historically was a time of 
more fantasy figures -- elves, dragons, pixies -- than the Renaissance era. 
"That's why you have everything from strolling werewolves and elves to knights 
and dragon slayers," she said. "A lot of people who go to the Renaissance Faire 
come here, but this theme attracts a different kind of vendor." 
</P>
<P>
A different kind, indeed. In one booth are beaded head chains, a fashion must 
for damsels of the period. "You'd look wonderful in chains, my lady," a 
well-dressed lord called out to a passer-by. The woman sauntered over to 
inspect them. "I've heard that before," she replied with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Swords and other medieval fighting wear are also in abundance. "Most people who 
buy these are more interested in the period than they are in using them as a 
weapon," said Bill Handel, who held up a flail -- a spiked iron ball at the end 
of a chain. "One guy did ask me if it would hold up in combat, though. I 
wouldn't sell it to him." 
</P>
<P>
There are booths that sell crafts, including clothing, boots and jewelry. 
Depending on how much you want to know, a Tarot card reader will tell your 
fortune for $15, $25 or $35. Walking sticks with inlaid crystals sell for about 
$75. 
</P>
<P>
For the man who has everything, though, check out a handmade chain of armor 
that sells for $1,200. Excluding tax. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do drugs and so this is where the money goes," said Sandra Gable, 
whose husband, Jim, was wearing close to $1,300 in heavy metal. "I love this 
period in history and getting dressed up is an escape valve. I'm a nurse and 
he's a cop and so we need that." 
</P>
<P>
Many other visitors apparently share that view. Except for the occasional pair 
of Reeboks that peeked out beneath leather garb, most costumed fair-goers 
appeared to have taken pains to make their costumes authentic. Others, 
stretching the definition a bit, took some liberties.

"I'm not a Klingon," said Dianne Burry, whose pointed ears and severely angled 
eyebrows resembled some attendees at Star Trek conventions. "I'm a Scottish 
elf. If I were a Klingon, I'd have electronic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
To prove her point, Burry, a correctional officer who came from Chino for the 
event, pulled aside her cape to reveal a 12-inch dirk -- a knife she said was 
"worn by elves" of the day.

"Of course, carrying this on the streets of California is illegal, but here it 
is allowed." 
</P>
<P>
(In 1987, a Los Angeles County ordinance was passed to address the increasing 
number of groups that use weapons for historical re-enactments. The ordinance 
states that weapons may be carried for any "lawful occupational, recreational 
or religious activity.")

The fair is more than just a gathering of people who want to live out their 
fantasies. Dragonwood Inc. is a nonprofit organization that selects small 
charities in need of funding. This year, Dzilvelis said 20% of the proceeds are 
being donated to the Adolescent Alliance, a La Crescenta-based nonprofit 
organization that provides shelter and treatment for teen-agers infected with 
the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually Dragonwood would like to purchase land in the Los Angeles area for 
a permanent site," Dzilvelis said. "Then after one charity is helped, another 
one can be chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Cost of admission is $8.95 for adults, $6.95 for students and seniors and $2.50 
for children 5 to 12. Children under 5 are admitted free. Hours of the fair are 
10 a.m. to dusk.

SERVICE TAKES A HOLIDAY OVER HEARTY CUBAN FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cooking at La Cubana might be OK, but the reception and service aren't. The 
maitre d' must have had something other than the customers on his mind the 
times I was there. On one occasion he didn't bother to leave his table to greet 
and seat our party. On another, he was completely unhelpful in dealing with our 
request to put together a table that would seat five comfortably. And he walked 
by other new arrivals without even acknowledging their presence. 
</P>
<P>
Also, don't expect to be served exactly what you order. One evening the soup 
didn't arrive and the shrimp and turkey dish contained peanuts instead of the 
requested walnuts. But you can count on one thing: You're not going to leave 
feeling hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's ever accused Cuban food of being too light. Indeed, if "light dining" 
is what you're after, La Cubana is not your kind of place. Order a main dish 
here, and you get a hefty load of meat and a substantial dose of starch. 
There's rice, black beans, moros y cristianos (rice and beans), yucca (cassava 
root), French fries and plantains, which may come from the banana family but 
seem awfully starchy when fried in their "green" or unripe state. 
</P>
<P>
As at other Cuban restaurants, the cooking at La Cubana shows some Chinese 
influence but leans more toward hearty, Mexican-style food than to 
sophisticated Cuban cooking. 
</P>
<P>
There was a disappointing similarity in many of the main dishes. Too frequently 
they were made with some variation of an onion and tomato-based sauce, and the 
results were mixed. Costilla de Rinonada, a T-bone steak, was tender and 
flavorsome. Tasajo, shredded dried beef, however, was unpleasantly stringy. 
Then again, Rueda de Serrucho, fried kingfish, was tasty. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
Two unusual dishes were poles apart. Rabo, oxtail in a well-seasoned tomatoey 
sauce, was the best dish sampled. The meat was tasty, moist, tender and 
well-complemented by the spiced tomato mixture with which it was joined. It was 
almost a stew. The real oddity was camarones con pavo, shrimp and turkey made 
with either walnuts or peanuts. This seems less weird if you think of it as a 
Chinese stir-fry dish; like many wok preparations, it contains chopped 
scallions, green peppers and onions. However, it had none of the subtlety and 
balance of Chinese cooking, and saying it was weird to the taste would be kind. 
</P>
<P>
Side dishes at La Cubana varied widely in appeal as well. The traditional 
ensalada de aguacates was superb. The perfectly ripe, sensuously buttery and 
fully flavored avocadoes were united with cut raw onion by a simple oil and 
lemon juice dressing. Of the soups (there are two on the menu but one, fabada 
Asturiana, was never available when I was at La Cubana), potaje de garbanzos 
was pleasant, the chickpeas augmented with smoky chorizo and a little hot chile 
pepper. And although the fried green plantains were close to cardboard in 
texture, the ripe ones (platanos maduros) were sweet and soft. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts included two common guava preparations: cascos de guayaba and 
mermelada de guayaba. The first is guava halves cooked to a semi-soft stewlike 
consistency; the second is a jam. Both were served with cream cheese which goes 
strangely well with guava. 
</P>
<P>
Soft drinks at La Cubana are of the intensely flavored, less-sweet Caribbean 
style. Iron Beer (non-alcoholic) contains tamarind flavor, Jupina is 
pineapple-based and Materva is made from a tea-like leaf. Since they are new 
tastes to most people, try one or more. You may well find one that appeals to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 La Cubana, 720 E. Colorado Blvd., Glendale. (818) 243-4398. Open noon to 9 
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Beer and wine. MasterCard, Visa. Parking lot.

PREVIEW: CHERYL BENTYNE: TRANSFERRING TO A SOLO ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of the Manhattan Transfer, Cheryl Bentyne has both success and 
security. Still, she occasionally likes to have the stage to herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Musically, singing in a group is very structured," she said. "It's real exact 
singing. And we don't have a lot of freedom in terms of soloing; most of the 
time we just do one number apiece. That's why I think it's important to go it 
alone once in a while. It strengthens the group." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, Bentyne will go it alone. It will be 
just her voice and the piano playing of Cory Allen, who often works with 
Bentyne. They put together the morning radio feature "Lady Sings the News" a 
couple of years ago for KTWV-FM (94.7). 
</P>
<P>
Much of the show's material will come from Bentyne's forthcoming solo album -- 
her first. "We start to record next week," she said. "I'm hoping Tuesday's show 
will help me get my chops together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to rehearse at home, but it's a whole other thing to get in 
front of an audience -- you either make it or break it. It's not even a matter 
of the audience's response, but how things come out of my mouth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bentyne, who won a Grammy with Bobby McFerrin in 1986 for their vocal 
arrangement of "Another Night in Tunisia" on Manhattan Transfer's "Vocalese" 
album, is also set to begin work on a new group album. Her solo album and the 
Manhattan Transfer album are due to be released about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
She's tentatively planning a solo tour to support the album. "It's twice as 
much work -- like juggling two careers. I do want to showcase after the album 
comes out, but that will be down the road." 
</P>
<P>
As for Tuesday's show, she says, "It'll be pretty low-key. We're just going to 
get goofy and sing the songs we love . . . oh, there you see, I can't stop 
saying we." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Bentyne performs Tuesday at Le Cafe, 14633 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
Shows begin at 9:15 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. $8 cover charge. For information, call 
(818) 986-2662. LAURIE OCHOA

REPORT IS BLOW TO OIL LEASES OFF CALIF. COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A National Academy of Sciences panel has concluded that the Interior Department 
lacks sufficient information to proceed with projected oil drilling leases in 
two sites off the California coast, according to a report to be made public 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Its finding that knowledge about the consequences of oil exploration there is 
"inadequate and unreliable" marks a major blow to Administration hopes to set 
policy for the controversial sites by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the prestigious National Research Council could result in further 
postponements of leasing steps already delayed by a recent congressional 
moratorium barring lease sales until next Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by the White House, found that the government had not 
gathered enough information about either Southern California oceanography or 
the effects of drilling on the region's social and economic life to go forward 
with a leasing decision. 
</P>
<P>
It similarly faulted the Interior Department for failing to take into account 
the socioeconomic consequences of an oil lease off Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The finding comes just two months before a Cabinet-level task force is due to 
recommend to President Bush whether drilling in the two California sites and in 
a separate Florida tract should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The report, made available by an Administration source, is to be presented to 
the panel at a public meeting today. Interior Department officials expressed 
disappointment with its findings. They acknowledged that it could weaken the 
impact of the task force report severely. The report had been expected to 
recommend drilling in at least some sites. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the research council criticisms, the scheduled 
Administration policy recommendation almost certainly will have to be 
accompanied by the caveat that more research is needed, representatives from 
both sides of the issue agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The need for further study could delay leasing steps beyond the dates set by 
the moratorium, which prohibits even prelease activity in Southern California's 
Lease Sale 95 until June 1. No actual lease sale in that tract or Northern 
California's Lease Sale 91 tract could take place until at least next Oct. 1 
under the congressionally imposed restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kallman, executive director of the task force, said through a spokesman 
that the findings of the research council will be "incorporated in our final 
report to the President." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of offshore drilling hailed the report as a bold action that raises 
questions not only about the three lease sales in question, but about the 
entire process that sets aside parts of the nation's outer continental shelf 
for oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very damning report," said Andy Palmer, a spokesman for the American 
Oceans Campaign. "I think it calls into question the whole viability of the 
offshore leasing program." 
</P>
<P>
"It basically confirms what environmentalists have been saying for years," said 
Ann Nothoff, a senior project planner for the Natural Resoures Defense Council. 
"We've gone ahead making these decisions (about offshore drilling) without 
having adequate information." 
</P>
<P>
The NAS Research Council concluded that, for all lease sale areas, the 
available scientific information about potential environmental impacts does not 
provide a sufficient basis for the government to decide whether to proceed with 
oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it found some of the available information so flawed as to provide 
inadequate grounding even for a decision to proceed with leasing, an earlier 
and less drastic step in the oil exploration process. 
</P>
<P>
The council raised the most questions about the adequacy of data available for 
the proposed Lease Sale 116 off the Gulf Coast of Florida, where it said the 
Interior Department had inadequate information about ecological and social 
consequences of drilling and only marginal data about oceanographic 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
"Physical oceanographic information is sufficient to predict that any oil spill 
in the sale area would probably soon hit the coast," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California, the council found information about the ecological 
consequences of drilling to be adequate for an informed decision on leasing. 
</P>
<P>
But it strongly criticized as inadequate and unreliable the available data 
about the physical oceanography of the lease sale area, where it said the flows 
of currents that could bring spilled oil ashore are not sufficiently 
understood. And it said that it is doubtful whether the Interior Department has 
adequately considered information about the socioeconomic consequences of 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Lease Sale 91 off Northern California received less criticism from 
the council, which decided that both ecological and oceanographic data for the 
region provide adequate grounds for a leasing decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the council said that socioeconomic matters -- such as estimates of beach 
attendance and the degree to which it would be influenced by the presence of 
oil derricks -- were treated "more generally, abstractly and incompletely" than 
other factors. 
</P>
<P>
On another score, however, the research council offered a stamp of approval to 
the leasing process. It concluded that the government has available adequate 
data to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon reserves likely to lie beneath the 
ocean floor in the proposed lease areas.

VANDALISM, GRAFFITI PLAGUE RAIL LINE BEFORE IT OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concrete structures are hardly dry at the new stations along the 
$752-million Long Beach Light Rail Line and the trains won't start running 
until next summer. But already graffiti, vandalism and theft are major 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Stations all along the 22-mile line from the Long Beach Harbor through 
South-Central Los Angeles into downtown are being defaced by gang graffiti and 
a newer, more individualized kind of spray-paint vandalism called "tagging." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Los Angeles County Transportation Commission officials say, 
thieves are stealing whatever they can from the construction zones. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so aggressive they've even run off armed security guards at 
construction sites," said John Stacy, commission security coordinator. "They'll 
steal anything -- lumber, signal boxes . . . especially anything with copper or 
aluminum on it." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an enormous problem," said Norman Jester, a commission spokesman. 
Because the new line runs through low-income neighborhoods dominated by gangs, 
some thievery and vandalism was expected. "But," he said, "no one envisioned 
the problem would be this real or of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
The new transit line, expected to be completed in July or August, will be the 
first operating in a planned 150-mile, countywide rail network. Authorities 
fear that unless they take immediate counter-measures, the problems here could 
spread to the other lines as they are built, including the $3.4-billion Metro 
Rail subway, already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
To combat the problem, the commission has hired the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to patrol the construction sites and provide helicopter 
surveillance on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
But the long-term solution, they believe, may be to adopt practices undertaken 
in urban areas such as New York and Washington, where officials spend millions 
each year to control graffiti and vandalism in their transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
Although the New York subways have long been regarded as among the nation's 
dirtiest and most heavily vandalized, officials there are reporting surprising 
success in a $6-billion, five-year fight to clean up and rebuild the badly 
deteriorated, graffiti-smeared system. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, a clean transit system is taken for granted because 
the situation was never allowed to get out of hand, most experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to our success is that no piece of graffiti or slashed seat is seen by 
the public the next day," Washington transit spokesman Robert Sloan said. "All 
of it has to be cleaned up within 24 hours . . . or the problem feeds on 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials hope to adopt the same policy, but admit they have a long 
way to go. 
</P>
<P>
So far, theft, destruction of property and removal of graffiti on the new Long 
Beach line have cost the commission $350,000, Stacy reported. The commission 
has hired three Community Youth Grant Services Project cleanup crews to 
sandblast graffiti from the new station structures. New kinds of anti-graffiti 
paints and sealer coats are being tried, and the commission staff is asking for 
at least $120,000 more to finance this work. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach route -- called the Blue Line -- is designed to carry 50,000 
riders a day and will eventually link up with the $3.4-billion Metro Rail Red 
Line subway at 7th and Flower streets in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What Jester and other transit officials fear most is that the graffiti will 
become an instant symbol of decay and lack of control by transit authorities 
that can frighten off riders, as it did in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We must keep the graffiti off of the line because we don't want riders to 
perceive there is any danger," Jester said. "Unless you get rid of the graffiti 
and keep it off, riders will not have a sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the Long Beach transit line is above ground and still easily 
accessible. When construction is complete, the right-of-way will be entirely 
fenced. However, the unmanned stations as planned will be open and protected 
only by video cameras and occasional patrols. Already, as the Blue Line nears 
completion, entire approach ramps, walls and supporting columns in the new 
train stations have been defaced by tangled patterns of red, black and white 
stylistic scribbles. Some of the graffiti marks turf claimed by gangs such as 
the "Watts Vario Grape St." or a clique of the "South Side Watts XIII" called 
the "Winos." 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school-age youngsters are spraying much of the graffiti on the new 
structures, neighbors say. "There are a lot of little kids . . . they come out 
after dark, like vampires," said Annabel Medrano, who lives by the tracks near 
Slauson Avenue. She said the police never respond to her complaints. Recently, 
a different kind of graffiti has begun showing up along the transit line -- a 
kind previously seen primarily in the East, experts said. Called "tagging," 
this form of spray-can vandalism is the work of individuals who develop their 
own unique "tag" or moniker and try to leave it in as many places as they can 
in one night, commission security coordinator Stacy said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are also attacking the RTD," Stacy said, referring to the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District and its fleet of 2,465 buses. One tagger may 
spray his or her moniker 80 to 100 times a night, he said. Taggers even 
circulate underground newsletters to keep their growing numbers informed on 
ways to beat anti-graffiti campaigns, according to Stacy. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials report that they now spend $9 million a year fighting graffiti 
and vandalism, a statistic that gives some measure of the dimensions of the 
problem. RTD officials say they are trying their best to clean the buses and 
replace up to 700 seats that are slashed each day, but the battle is 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"We send a bus out clean in the morning and it will come back in the evening 
looking like it has never been cleaned," RTD Associate General Manager John 
Richeson said. "The cost is getting astronomical and the (seat) damage is 
getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Rapid Transit District, the Los Angeles City Council and other public 
agencies have been trying to fight back against the vandals, but with little 
obvious success. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a crisis," Councilman Marvin Braude said during a recent 
anti-graffiti debate before the council. "Our society is deteriorating. And 
graffiti is the symbol of that crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Still, transit officials here say New York's example provides the best evidence 
that the battle against graffiti can be won. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City Transit Authority operates an 85-year-old system that had 
deteriorated badly during the city's fiscal crisis in the early 1970s. 
Ridership on the 26 subway lines had plummeted as trains derailed and fires 
broke out underground. The stations were overrun by hooligans and vandals who 
sprayed paint everywhere they could reach, said Bob Slovak, spokesman for the 
New York authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti was an international symbol for everything that was wrong with 
transit authority," Slovak said. "The system was a mess. . . . By the early 
1980s riders were leaving in droves." 
</P>
<P>
Without riders, no system can afford to operate. 
</P>
<P>
To stop the economic hemorrhage, the transit authority launched a $6-billion 
campaign in 1984 to rebuild, refurbish and modernize 466 stations, 704 miles of 
track and 6,200 rail cars. A top priority was to get rid of the graffiti, every 
trace of it. 
</P>
<P>
"When we announced that one of our first goals was to get rid of the graffiti 
everyone laughed at us," Sloan said. "They told us it couldn't be done." 
</P>
<P>
Car-cleaning facilities were set up in the terminals, teams of 
graffiti-cleaners attacked each station and orders went out that no train or 
bus with graffiti on it would be allowed out of the yards. Everything had to be 
cleaned before it could go into service, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
When vandals were caught, their sentences included long days cleaning graffiti 
from transit facilities and equipment. Even parents were hauled into court. 
Special anti-graffiti teams went into the schools to spread the word: no more 
tagging. 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, the last graffiti-marked subway car was cleaned and rolled out into 
the system, Slovak said. "Now," he added, "we have a system that is 100% clean 
and graffiti-free. It took a lot of dedicated work . . . but once the vandals 
couldn't see their tags roaming the city anymore, they began to lose interest." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, said the results are a hopeful sign for local transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see what New York and Washington have accomplished, it tells you it 
can be done," he said "We intend to instill that kind of standard."

The Legislature convened in special session Thursday to act on an earthquake 
relief package and was immediately confronted with requests from local 
officials to raise the sales tax more than the quarter-cent being proposed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian and key lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The local officials got no encouragement from either Deukmejian or legislative 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials said non-highway damage alone in Northern California 
communities hit by the Oct. 17 earthquake will total $6 billion, about $1 
billion more than estimates by the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed quarter-cent tax increase in the 6-cents-per-dollar state sales 
tax would be in effect for 13 months beginning Dec. 1. It would raise an 
estimated $800 million. Deukmejian contends that the quarter-cent increase, 
along with hundreds of millions more from reserves, will be enough to finance 
the state's share of earthquake costs. President Bush has signed a 
$3.45-billion disaster relief bill, most of which will come to California. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials, with support from some lawmakers, claimed that far more 
money will be needed to put the San Francisco Bay Area and the Santa 
Cruz-Hollister regions back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer to the question is not a quarter-cent sales tax increase for 13 
months," Santa Cruz County Supervisor Fred Keeley told members of the Assembly, 
who met as a committee of the whole. "If you agree to that, you are agreeing to 
sentencing them (earthquake victims) to a continuing disaster. We are proposing 
a one-cent sales tax increase. And it is penny-wise and pound-foolish not to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata told reporters that earthquake 
damage in his county alone will total $2 billion. "We are going to need a whole 
lot more than $800 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keeley, Perata and other city and county officials spent the day in an intense 
lobbying effort to get more financial aid for earthquake-stricken areas. They 
want a total of $2.7 billion in state aid alone, not counting federal disaster 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the Legislature, Deukmejian conceded that the tax 
increase itself would not be enough to finance all the repairs and financial 
aid that will be needed. He said extra costs will be "almost certainly incurred 
as damage reports are updated and completed." He explained that other money for 
earthquake relief will come from the state's budget reserve. The nonpartisan 
Commission on State Finance has said that the reserve now contains $674 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor was in Los Angeles to attend a black-tie arts awards 
ceremony Thursday night. He is expected back in Sacramento at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost told a delegation of local officials 
Thursday that a quarter-cent sales tax increase would be sufficient. Frost said 
anything more would put the state over the restrictive spending limit approved 
by voters in 1979 and run into other political problems. 
</P>
<P>
His assessment was backed up by both Democratic and Republican legislators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said those who have asked for 
more money have yet to prove it is needed. "The governor has done his homework. 
He has come forward with a figure. He has matched that figure with a 
revenue-raising figure. The speculators ought to produce or shut up," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said one of the 
considerations in proposing the relatively modest quarter-cent increase was 
that it would not be large enough to endanger the proposed gasoline tax 
increase that voters will be asked to approve next June to finance a 10-year, 
$18.5-billion transportation program. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should do anything to jeopardize its passage," Roberti told 
members of the Senate at the start of the special session. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville), the GOP vice chairman of the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said he was not convinced that even a modest 
sales tax increase is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do all that needs to be done," he said, "but we don't know how much 
money is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Jesse R. Huff told the Assembly that he expects the state 
responsibility for matching federal assistance to come to about $855 million. 
Tax relief associated with the quake should total another $150 million at 
least, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) accused the Administration 
of planning to shift funds from health and social service programs to 
earthquake relief even as it was saying that the sales tax increase will be 
sufficient to cover the damages. 
</P>
<P>
Speier released a Health Services Department internal memo that listed about 
$20 million in programs that she said were being put on hold by Administration 
officials. The programs ranged from AIDS prevention and prenatal care to 
pesticide regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want to hold the rest of the budget hostage to deal with the 
earthquake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Huff conceded that he favors delaying expansion of some social programs and 
redirecting the money toward earthquake relief. But he emphasized that the 
Administration is still debating the question. "No decisions are final until 
the governor makes them final," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Assembly Democrats complained that the quarter-cent tax increase is too 
low. Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee, described the governor's plan as "cheap and chicken." 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Sen. Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland) said the quarter-cent increase 
"is far too low. We ought to at least go to half a cent." 
</P>
<P>
But even as some Democrats were pushing for more funds, Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) proposed that the state freeze increases in 
spending for the first 12 weeks of the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
He said this move would produce a saving of $800 million, equivalent to the 
amount that would be collected by the proposed sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the proposed tax increase, Deukmejian is asking the Legislature to 
approve a package of 11 bills. 
</P>
<P>
The governor is asking for both the money and legal authority to finance the 
state's share of repairs to highways, roads, bridges and buildings. He also 
wants legislation that will make nonprofit agencies and higher education 
facilities eligible for state matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal is for the state to "ease the financial burden facing local 
government" by picking up their costs of repairing roads, highways and public 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the package are proposals for low-interest loans for homeowners who 
suffered damage in the quake and a plan to provide temporary housing to 
displaced renters and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the table is a proposal to provide cash grants of up to $10,000 each 
"to those disaster victims in the greatest need," and a request for the legal 
authority necessary to put highway and freeway repair work on the "fast track" 
by exempting contractors from certain government permit requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Deukmejian said he wants the Legislature to approve a special 
damage compensation fund for victims of the earthquake who were killed or 
injured in the collapse of a stretch of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also came up with many of their own proposals. 
</P>
<P>
About three dozen earthquake-related bills were introduced in the Senate alone. 
Many of the bills would add to the financial aid package proposed by the 
governor. One of the bills, drafted by Roberti, would make it a felony to do 
earthquake repair jobs while acting as an unlicensed contractor, architect or 
structural engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The special session is expected to last until Saturday. Two years ago, the 
Legislature met in similar extraordinary session, also in November, to approve 
a $91-million package of benefits to aid victims of the Southern California 
earthquake. Many of the bills are redrafted versions of the legislation passed 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
When California lawmakers left the Capitol in September, they did not 
anticipate returning until January, when the legislative session was scheduled 
to resume. However, Gov. George Deukmejian called the legislators back to 
Sacramento this week to find ways to pay for destruction left by the Oct. 17 
earthquake that shook Northern California.

HELM'S FAMILY PLANS LAWSUIT, SORTS FILM OFFERS

<P>
The family of Buck Helm, who survived four days in the rubble of the collapsed 
Nimitz Freeway after the Bay Area earthquake, has retained an attorney to file 
a claim against Caltrans -- and a press agent to deal with reporters and "sort 
through" a plethora of offers from movie and television production companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking all the offers," said Gary Frischer, the Beverly Hills public 
relations man who was hired by the Helm family's attorney, Vasilios B. Choulos 
of San Francisco. "We are sorting through all the offers at this time," 
Frischer said. "Some are lucrative." 
</P>
<P>
But Choulos, in an interview, insisted that the family was not trying to cash 
in on Helm's instant status as a folk hero. "I want to deny and scotch that 
before it gets started," Choulos said. 
</P>
<P>
Choulos said he hired Frischer, who is not well known in the Hollywood 
community, "to interface with the media." 
</P>
<P>
Choulos said it is "premature" to discuss the sale of rights to the Buck Helm 
story. "Buck could take a turn for the worse," Choulos said. "He is a tough 
bird, (but) he is under heavy medication and has a tube down his throat." 
</P>
<P>
Helm, 57, who spent 90 hours pinned in the Nimitz rubble and was rescued after 
officials had given up hope of finding more survivors, was transferred Thursday 
from Highland Hospital to Oakland's Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, where his 
condition remained "serious but stable." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney first said the family had received "at least 50 phone calls" from 
television and film producers seeking rights to the story, though he later 
scaled the number back to 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Their interest is noted, and they're told that at a later date, we'll get back 
to them," Choulos said. He declined to name the companies that made approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Choulos said he was retained by Helm's former wife and their children "to look 
after his interests when a claim is made against the state" and "to sort out 
various problems." He also said he welcomes the state to set up a compensation 
package that would avoid taking the Helm matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer told an Oakland press conference Thursday evening that the family 
intends to set up a charitable foundation that would receive contributions from 
the public "to help victims less fortunate" than Helm. He was vague about how 
the funds would be disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Robb Rothman, a partner with Leading Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, said the 
"feeding frenzy" among Hollywood types is typical for such a high-profile 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of ways to tell this story: from the point of view of the 
family, from the point of view of the rescuers," he said. "In a true-life story 
like this, (producers) will go out and try to buy up as many peoples' rights as 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
The agent, who is not involved in the Helm story, said that typically "a lot of 
marginal players" come out of the woodwork to bid for participants' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman said the Helm saga is best suited to movie-of-the-week treatment and 
estimated that the rights to the story could bring a total of $75,000 to 
$100,000 to all the major participants. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, an independent producer would secure the rights to the story and 
then approach a television network. 
</P>
<P>
An official at NBC said the network has not yet been approached. "Obviously, 
this is a very uplifting and heartwarming story, but that doesn't automatically 
make it a TV movie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look at the whole package," he added.

ABUSE OF FEMALES AT ACADEMY UNCOVERED

<P>
Students at the state-supported California Maritime Academy in Vallejo, 
especially female students, have been subjected to flagrant sexual harassment 
and discrimination, the National Maritime Administration has concluded in a 
scathing report. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the incidents occurred during annual three-month cruises aboard the 
training ship Golden Bear, especially during a ritual known as the "Equator 
crossing ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Maritime Administration investigators found these examples of misconduct: 
</P>
<P>
* During the 1988 cruise, midshipmen defecated in the hat of a female student, 
who then received demerits for appearing at formation without a hat. 
</P>
<P>
* Students called "polliwogs" (those who had not crossed the Equator before) 
were forced to engage in "acts of mock sodomy" with "shellbacks" (those with 
previous Equator crossings). 
</P>
<P>
* Polliwogs found guilty of "crimes" by what the report described as a 
shipboard "kangaroo court" were ordered to slide down an inflated escape slide 
filled with rotten food. 
</P>
<P>
* During the 1988 cruise, skits were presented that were so "malicious or 
vindictive" that "one female midshipman featured in a skit left the room in 
tears." 
</P>
<P>
* Two women told investigators they "hid in their berthing area for hours" to 
avoid participating in the Equator crossing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
* Women who complained about the Equator ritual told investigators they were 
given "unfair work assignments" such as cleaning up the kitchen or eight 
consecutive weeks of guard duty. 
</P>
<P>
The events that took place aboard the Golden Bear and at the Maritime Academy 
were due to "a breakdown in leadership and discipline by senior California 
Maritime Academy officials and a general lack of understanding by all 
midshipmen of what behavior constitutes sexual harassment and discrimination," 
the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the actions were not only discriminatory but also dangerous, 
investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, "polliwogs" were forced to crawl through torrents of water from 
fire hoses and "it is quite foreseeable that a midshipman could be washed 
overboard" in such a situation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Merchant Marine Capt. Warren G. Leback, the Federal Maritime Administrator, 
sent the findings to Bruce Johnston, chairman of the Board of Governors of the 
Maritime Academy, which is one of half a dozen institutions in the country that 
train students seeking to become licensed officers in the U.S. Merchant Marine. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors will meet in Vallejo on Nov. 15 and is expected to 
discuss the report. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy has 410 students this year, of whom 51 are women, and a faculty of 
40. The annual budget is more than $9 million, most of which comes from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Federal Maritime Administration, which is part of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, investigated the allegations of sexual harassment 
because it gives $100,000 a year to the school, subsidizes 215 of the students 
and also pays for the operation and maintenance of the Golden Bear, a World War 
II troop transport that was given to the school for training exercises in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The investigative team recommended that the school do away with the Equator 
crossing ceremony and "prohibit any further irresponsible and violent behavior 
on board the training vessel." 
</P>
<P>
The team also recommended that Merchant Marine Adm. John J. Ekelund, the 
school's president, and his aides take action to, among other things, create a 
"non-discriminatory environment," improve discipline procedures and student 
counseling and add at least one female to the permanent faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kilpatrick, dean of students at the Maritime Academy, acknowledged that 
there have been instances of sexual harassment and discrimination at the 
academy and on board the Golden Bear, but said, "we're doing what we can to 
keep proper controls over it." 
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick said students who were guilty of such behavior on the 1989 cruise 
were identified through a videotape shot by one of the midshipmen and were 
punished. Faculty members also were seen on the videotape, he said, but 
"unfortunately not at the time of the incidents" so none was punished. 
</P>
<P>
He called the Equator crossing ceremony a tradition "as long as there have been 
sailors at sea," but said the Board of Governors already has voted to abolish 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the report, Kilpatrick said, there are three women on the faculty 
now and a fourth will be added in January. There are also female counselors, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been a leader in programs for women," Kilpatrick said, noting that 
Lynn Korwatch, the first woman to become a merchant ship commander, was a 1976 
graduate of the academy. 
</P>
<P>
There have been allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at the 
Maritime Academy for several years. In 1988 an internal investigation at the 
academy confirmed many of the charges but little was done, according to the 
later Maritime Administration report, and the officer who conducted the 
investigation was demoted. 
</P>
<P>
After press reports and complaints from the office of Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), the Maritime Administration sent a six-member 
investigative team to Vallejo last June.

CALTRANS STUDY FAILED TO CHECK NIMITZ PILLARS; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKE: TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE SPOTTED FLAW, BUT COLUMNS WERE NOT A PRIORITY.

<P>
Caltrans never conducted a complete seismic study of the double-decked Nimitz 
Freeway, even though computer technology available for more than a decade could 
have uncovered flaws that contributed to its collapse, a top department 
official acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
State engineers conducted a partial seismic study of the Cypress viaduct in 
1977 as part of a program to strengthen the freeway structure in the event of 
an earthquake. But they never examined the design of the expressway's columns, 
which gave way in the Oct. 17 earthquake, said James E. Roberts, chief of the 
department's structures division. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not looking at columns at the time," Roberts said. "That was not our 
high priority." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Roberts said the 1977 analysis had shown that the freeway would 
withstand a major earthquake -- but that state officials could not find a copy 
of the study. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, however, he said the missing seismic analysis only 
examined how to strengthen the roadbed portion of the Cypress structure and was 
not a comprehensive earthquake study. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' disclosure is significant because Caltrans officials have repeatedly 
said they had believed the Nimitz, with its two-level, double-column design, 
would stand up in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one people were killed in the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
James H. Gates, a Caltrans structural mechanics engineer who headed the 1977 
study, lamented in an interview this week that he and his staff did not 
discover the danger in the columns when they conducted their analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"The disturbing thing from my point of view is that I didn't spot that 
problem," Gates said. "The disturbing thing from the point of view of the guys 
working for me is that they didn't spot the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying since 1986 to identify those vulnerable structures. We don't 
have any excuse. We just weren't able to do it. When you're looking at 15,000 
bridges, it's like finding a needle in a haystack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first warning the state received that such columns might be unsafe came 
about 2 1/2 months before the earthquake struck, when a committee of four 
engineers working as consultants to the department alerted the state that three 
freeways in San Francisco with a similar design were vulnerable to quakes. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Nimitz, these freeways were supported by columns that were fastened to 
the roadway with "hinges," which were designed to provide flexibility. In the 
case of the Nimitz, however, the columns were not strong enough to withstand 
the 7.1 earthquake that rocked the Bay Area. The three San Francisco freeways 
were damaged but did not collapse in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 analysis of the Cypress structure was conducted as part of the 
department's earthquake retrofit program, in which older bridges and highways 
were upgraded to meet new earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
For a freeway such as the Nimitz, that meant tying together sections of the 
roadway with steel cables so they would not come apart in a quake. But 
strengthening the roadbed may have put even greater stress on the columns and 
contributed to the collapse of the structure, state engineers have said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said a computer program developed in 1978 made seismic analysis much 
easier and could have helped spot the flaw in the Nimitz structure. But by 
then, he said, department engineers had moved on to other work. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the quake, the department will now conduct a complete seismic study 
of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge at a cost of several hundred thousand 
dollars, he said. One section of the bridge collapsed in the quake and is 
undergoing emergency repairs that are scheduled to be completed by Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said it is unlikely that the 1977 analysis will ever be found, because 
such records are frequently destroyed after four years. Rather than a formal 
study, he said, the seismic analysis was a series of calculations for 
strengthening the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, in a memo to Roberts earlier this week, said it is not possible to 
"guarantee" that there will not be fatalities on highway bridges in the event 
of another major earthquake. But he said the program to upgrade structures had 
been effective in reducing casualties in quakes during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to the best of our ability to anticipate the potential damage 
from future events and feel badly that we did not foresee the collapse at 
Cypress Avenue," he said in the memo.

Lin's design -- a curved black wall fronted by a circular black granite table 
with water gently flowing over both -- seeks to symbolize both the pain of the 
segregated old Dixie and the hope of an integrated New South. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as the memorial prepares to open, echoes of old racial battles 
resound here: 
</P>
<P>
A former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan says he wants to protest the "hideous 
memorial." Also, the governor has declined an invitation to attend the opening 
ceremony, leading some here to accuse him of racism -- a charge he denies. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial dominates a plaza near the church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
preached during the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and near the state Capitol, 
where the Confederate flag still flies under Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
The table contains the names of King and 39 others -- black and white -- 
murdered during the civil rights movement. It contains also a chronology of 
significant civil rights events between the May 17, 1954, Supreme Court 
decision banning school segregation and the April 4, 1968, murder of King. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall is a part of King's "I Have a Dream" speech. "(We will not be 
satisfied) until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty 
stream," the memorial vows, recalling King's 1963 address during the March on 
Washington and an earlier speech during the bus boycott, which was the catalyst 
for the nonviolent protest movement. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activists say that, although justice and righteousness remain 
largely unrealized, they have been brought closer by the numerous people who 
died struggling. The $700,000 memorial, paid for by the Southern Poverty Law 
Center, is viewed as a way of preserving history and teaching new generations 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Dees, executive director of the center, a nonprofit group that monitors 
and combats racist activity, gestured toward the memorial plaza, which adjoins 
his office building, saying: "I hope the memorial will educate young people to 
a small degree and spark their curiousity to get more information" about civil 
rights. "There's a lot of racial violence going on today." 
</P>
<P>
Lin said in a telephone interview from her home in New York that her new 
project will "let us remember how bad it's been and how far we have to go." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Vietnam memorial in the nation's capital, the names here sear the 
consciousness, silently testifying to the terror and brutality that divided the 
nation and to the cause that united it. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the names and descriptions that explain their murders: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rev. George Lee. "Killed for leading voter registration drive" in 
Belzoni, Miss., in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Emmett Louis Till. "Murdered for speaking to white woman" in Money, Miss., 
in 1955. He was 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Viola Gregg Liuzzo. "Killed by Klan while transporting marchers" on Selma 
Highway in Alabama in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Samuel Younge Jr. "Student civil rights activist killed in dispute over 
whites-only restroom" in Tuskegee, Ala., in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The names include the well-known, such as James E. Chaney, Andrew Goodman and 
Michael H. Schwerner, three civil rights workers abducted and murdered by the 
Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964. Their slayings were the subject 
of the movie "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are Oneal Moore and Willie Brewster, less well known, both "killed 
by nightriders" the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Benjamin Brown, Samuel Ephesians Hammond, Delano Herman Middleton 
and Henry Ezekial Smith, were killed while protesting racism when law 
enforcement officials fired on them. Others, such as Birmingham schoolgirls 
Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, died in 
racist bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally comes King's name, in the year 1968. The description accompanying it: 
"Assassinated Memphis, Tn." 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam memorial, which was opened in 1982, confronted bitter controversy 
as some Americans criticized its design as a "black gash of shame." However, 
early criticism was swamped in an outpouring of emotion and national catharsis 
generated by the slabs of polished granite containing the names of more than 
58,000 Americans killed in the war. 
</P>
<P>
The new memorial has escaped early condemnation, but already there is 
controversy here as well because Republican Gov. Guy Hunt, one of 15,000 people 
invited to Sunday's dedication, has said he will not participate. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott, said that the governor "has been very 
positive about the memorial and thinks it will be good for the state and good 
for tourism." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said that the governor could not attend the weekend activities, 
including a dinner Saturday, because "he's a Baptist preacher and has services 
all day Saturday and all day Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Raymond Payne can't wait for the unveiling of the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Here, he said, the names will "bring back a lot of memories. That's something 
that shouldn't be shut out of people's minds."

Six senior East German government and political officials resigned Thursday as 
the new East German leader, Egon Krenz, conferred with Polish officials in 
Warsaw about the political reforms that have been undertaken there. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN reported that more than 50,000 
demonstrators marched in various cities Thursday evening, calling for political 
and economic reforms -- which the news agency characterized as a "social 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The latest to fall from the Communist firmament, according to the official news 
agency, were Margot Honecker, minister of education and wife of ousted leader 
Erich Honecker; labor boss Harry Tisch, two regional party leaders and the 
heads of two minor political parties. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, thousands of additional East Germans crossed into 
Czechoslovakia hoping to escape to West Germany. About 8,000 people reportedly 
have taken this route in the past two days, since travel restrictions to 
Czechoslovakia were removed. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz flew to Warsaw to meet with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of 
Poland's new, Solidarity-led government, and with Communist President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski and Communist party chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz arrived in the Polish capital after spending two days in Moscow, where he 
discussed with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the economic and social reforms 
Gorbachev is pressing on his country. 
</P>
<P>
Of his talks in Warsaw, Krenz told reporters, "I can take a lot of good from 
this experience back (to East Germany)." 
</P>
<P>
PAP, the official Polish news agency, quoted Krenz as saying: "I think that all 
socialist states must learn from each other, and by learning and enriching our 
experience we can all move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Krenz visit indicates that the new East German regime 
desires to maintain close ties with Poland, even though Warsaw has introduced 
dramatic reforms of the sort that were rigidly resisted by Krenz's predecessor, 
Honecker -- who resigned last month under increasing popular pressure for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish government newspaper Rzeczpospolita offered Krenz the following 
advice: "Only a wide opening of activities for opposition parties, letting 
young people speak out, and clear changes of the political system can calm the 
situation and start a new stage in the history of this state." 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN announced the resignations of 
Margot Honecker, as minister for higher and technical education, and Tisch, a 
member of the party Politburo, as head of the Confederation of Free German 
Trade Unions. Both had been expected since mid-October, when Erich Honecker was 
forced out as national leader, and Tisch's resignation was announced in advance 
by the official news agency Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, who was accused of ignoring workers' rights, is expected to be expelled 
soon from the Politburo as well. To replace him as leader of the confederation, 
the news agency said, the Central Committee of the ruling Socialist Unity 
(Communist) Party, named Annelis Kimmel, head of the confederation's East 
Berlin division. 
</P>
<P>
The other four officials whose departures were announced include the heads of 
two parties allied with the Communists in the National Front and party leaders 
in two of the 15 East German bezirke, or counties. 
</P>
<P>
They are Heinrich Homann of the National Democratic Party, Gerald Goetting of 
the Christian Democratic Union, Herbert Ziegenhahn of Gera and Hans Albrecht of 
Suhl. No official reason was given for their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency produced another jolt with news that the board of 
the official union of composers and musicians resigned Thursday after coming 
under pressure to produce more openness in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Czech sources said that as many as 8,000 East Germans have flooded 
into Czechoslovakia since travel restrictions were removed Wednesday. About 
1,300 of them were said to have applied at the West German Embassy for 
documents that will enable them to travel to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans must go first to their own embassy in Prague, where they 
renounce their citizenship, and this step apparently has developed into 
something of a bottleneck. According to West German officials in Prague, the 
East German Embassy can process only about 100 applications a day. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this, West German officials have asked Czechoslovak authorities to 
designate sheltered places where the East Germans can wait. 
</P>
<P>
Also in East Berlin, the news agency ADN on Thursday quoted retired spymaster 
Markus Wolf as saying that the state security apparatus must be responsible to 
the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, who retired in 1987 after directing the East German espionage service for 
29 years, said in Leipzig that "it is wrong to believe that the Ministry for 
State Security stands above the state and can be considered independent of 
developments in society." 
</P>
<P>
A rumor circulating in East Berlin has it that Wolf will come out of retirement 
and take a top government job. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, meanwhile, French President Francois Mitterrand arrived for two days 
of discussions with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The situation in East Germany was 
said to be high on their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn sources said Kohl had been persuaded to drop his insistence on visiting an 
ethnic German church in Silesia during his visit to Poland next week.

SOVIET CITIZENS CAN NOW SUE GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: UP UNTIL NOW, PEOPLE WITH COMPLAINTS COULD ONLY SUE INDIVIDUAL 
OFFICIALS, NOT THE BUREAUCRACIES.

<P>
Soviet citizens won the right Thursday, for the first time, to sue government 
agencies to seek redress of their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, enacted the law as part of a 
sweeping reform of the Soviet legal system. The law will permit people to bring 
complaints against state organizations into independent courts for a hearing 
and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Artem M. Yakovlev, a member of the Supreme Soviet's Legal Affairs Committee, 
described it as one of the most important and practical measures to protect 
individual rights and to transform the country into a society governed by law 
rather than bureaucratic regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, people with complaints against the government could only sue 
individual officials, charging them with violating regulations, bias or 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful, faceless bureaucracies that control so many aspects of Soviet 
life could not, even under a law adopted in 1987, be taken to court to answer 
for their decisions or actions. Many complaints were turned over for 
investigation and resolution to the very agencies that brought on the 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet legal system, the classic European concept of "sovereign 
immunity" under which the state could not be sued was reinforced by such 
socialist principles as the "dictatorship of the proletariat." This made all 
government decisions unchallengeable except within the country's political 
forums, where the bureaucracy has a strong voice. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Soviet citizens have been able to turn only to legislative bodies, 
such as the Supreme Soviet, for review of their complaints, and these are now 
recognized as incapable of investigating and assessing the thousands of 
grievances brought to them. 
</P>
<P>
The main grievance -- unlawful dismissal by a state-owned enterprise -- could 
not be heard unless a worker could argue that an enterprise official fired him 
out of malice or in violation of law. Most cases simply never got to court 
because the official could not be identified or his wrongdoing proved. 
</P>
<P>
With other legislation under consideration to broaden civil rights here, 
Yakovlev told his colleagues that the courts had to be authorized to review 
complaints of infringement. Among the pending legislation is a bill ensuring 
"freedom of conscience," particularly religious belief, another establishing 
press freedom and still others protecting the rights of free speech, political 
assembly and association. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies called for the effective date of the new law to be brought 
forward to Dec. 1 from next July, but Yakovlev told them the courts need time 
to prepare for the expected flood of cases, especially those certain to be 
brought by dismissed workers. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the Supreme Soviet gave preliminary approval to a law that 
will increase state pensions to the retired, who number nearly 60 million, a 
fifth of the population, by an average of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the equivalent of $46 billion a year at 
official exchange rates will be needed to pay the higher pensions. But he 
described the move as essential to lift the elderly and disabled out of their 
deepening poverty.

DOZENS OF BRITISH CULTURAL CAUSES LOOKING FOR U.S. MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Wanamaker's New Globe Theater project is only one of dozens of causes 
seeking U.S. money to help preserve Britain's cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"They all seem to think there's a lot more money here than there is," 
complained Ann Webster Smith, chairman of the Washington-based American Friends 
of English Heritage. "A lot of them think Americans are just going to sit down 
and write checks," she added in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Among the newcomers is Oxford University, which launched a U.S. campaign for 
the first time a few weeks ago. And the Church of England has begun a 14-city 
U.S. effort to raise $3 million to help save the crumbling spire of the 
600-year-old cathedral in the town of Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
These join such veteran organizations as New York's Royal Oak Foundation, an 
affiliate of England's National Trust. The charity is Britain's largest private 
landowner, sworn to preserve hundreds of thousands of prime seacoast acres, 
gardens and about 240 historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no comprehensive figures available here, it is believed that 
American giving to such causes amounts to millions of dollars a year. All of it 
is tax deductible so long as the British recipient registers as a nonprofit 
organization under the appropriate section of the U.S. tax code. 
</P>
<P>
The private U.S. contributions are becoming more important during what the 
experts here describe as a transition period from mostly public to more private 
funding of museums, the arts and other cultural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, noted Anne Collins, a former U.S. cultural attache here who is 
now an arts consultant, Britain has been like most European countries, with the 
government heavily subsidizing what is sometimes called the "heritage 
industry." There was little tradition of individual giving, and there are still 
no U.S.-style tax incentives to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Thatcher government has begun trimming subsidies, in effect, by 
holding budget increases to a figure lower than the rate of inflation. But the 
practice of individual and corporate giving continues to lag. As a result, some 
British institutions are growing desperate. 
</P>
<P>
"My own particular territory, the subsidized theater, now seems to be as much 
under threat as the Amazonian rain forest, and there are as sound reasons for 
preserving the one as the other," Richard Eyre, director of the financially 
strapped National Theater, complained in an Arts Advocacy Day speech recently. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it's probably only a surprise that there aren't more 
British cultural institutions seeking U.S. financial support, especially since 
Americans have the reputation of being unreconstructed Anglophiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are just crazy about England," agreed Smith. "They're really 
interested in their English heritage." 
</P>
<P>
But while one J. Paul Getty or Armand Hammer can admittedly solve the problems 
of a cash-strapped British cause, finding such benefactors "is not easy," she 
said.

Judges and court workers began a series of nationwide strikes Thursday after a 
judge and a congressman were murdered, apparently by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In Medellin, where the judge was killed, federal justices walked off the job 
indefinitely until they receive more protection. It is the third time that 
judges have gone on strike in the last three months to protest assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest slayings, federal Judge Mariela Espinoza was killed by submachine 
gun fire from two speeding cars as she arrived at her Medellin home Wednesday 
night with two guards. A guard and a bystander were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza, 43, was one of 42 federal appellate judges in Medellin, the cocaine 
capital of Colombia. It was not immediately known if she had handled drug 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Bogota, federal Rep. Luis Francisco Madero, 62, was killed 
with a pistol shot to the head Wednesday night by a man outside his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Madero, a 27-year veteran in Colombia's House of Representatives and a former 
ambassador to the United Nations, had supported extradition of Colombians to 
the United States to face drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for either slaying, but security forces blamed 
drug traffickers.

Labor unrest and nationalist protests spread in the Soviet Union. Coal strikes 
grew in the Arctic, Azerbaijanis joined the country's growing draft-resistance 
movement and thousands of Georgian demonstrators refused to leave Tbilisi's 
main square. The persistent labor strikes and nationalist rallies follow a 
tumultuous summer of unrest and show the government's inability to stem the

A growing proportion of East European refugees coming to the United States will 
be from countries other than Poland and Hungary under a new policy based on the 
danger of persecution, Bush Administration officials said. Officials told a 
House subcommittee that the governments of Poland and Hungary are growing more 
liberal -- so that the danger of persecution there is receding -- but that is 
not true in Czechoslovakia and Romania.

<P>
Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko was not in a good mood. He had just returned to his 
City Hall office from a candidates' forum at a nursing home where, he said, his 
Republican opponent in Yonkers' mayoral race -- three-term Councilman Henry 
Spallone -- had been up to his usual political tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"He got in there as if he were talking to a regular audience and started 
pounding the table and ranting about constitutional rights," Wasicsko fumed. 
"These people are 80 or 90 years old. They're about ready to drop. You should 
try to cheer them up and win them over with a little pleasantness. But he is 
fixated in his crusade on this one issue." 
</P>
<P>
The one issue, as no one in this Hudson River community of 190,000 needs to be 
told, is public housing desegregation. It is an issue that thrust Yonkers into 
the national spotlight last year when defiant members of the City Council 
refused to accept a federal court-mandated consent decree to build integrated 
public housing in predominantly white neighborhoods. Eventually, bludgeoned by 
heavy contempt-of-court fines that threatened the city treasury with 
bankruptcy, a majority of the seven-member council voted to go along with the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Wasicsko (pronounced wah-SIS-koh), a supporter of compliance with the housing 
plan, easily captured the Democratic mayoral nomination in September's primary 
election. "There is a silent majority out there ready to put the issue aside 
because there are things that are more important in the mayoralty race," he 
crowed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the housing controversy has overshadowed other issues in the general 
election, such as mounting fiscal ills, lagging economic development and 
growing crime and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Spallone, 63, a retired New York City police detective and Yonkers' vice mayor, 
accuses Wasicsko of selling the city's right of self-determination down the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a housing question; it's a constitutional question," said Spallone, 
who is campaigning as "The People's Choice." "Consent decrees are striking at 
the very heart of communities. If we go with this (housing desegregation) 
program, we'll destroy and bankrupt this city." 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign leaflet, Wasicsko retaliated by charging that "Henry Spallone 
voted to destroy us. Now, he wants to lead us." 
</P>
<P>
Wasicsko, 30, was first elected to office two years ago in a campaign opposed 
to placing public housing in white neighborhoods. But he characterizes 
Tuesday's election as a vote for Yonkers' future and contends that attempts to 
overturn the court-ordered housing plan are futile and costly. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city has paid more than $25 million in legal costs to fight public 
housing desegregation in the eight years since the U.S. Department of Justice 
first filed suit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wasicsko has picked up the endorsement of the local Westchester County 
newspaper, as well as those of the Daily News and the Times in neighboring New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Spallone seems to have a sizable body of support among Yonkers' largely 
Democratic electorate. Most political experts say that the race is too close to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
At a forum Monday on Yonkers' predominantly white East Side, Wasicsko was 
greeted with boos and catcalls while Spallone met with enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
Spallone was one of the two holdouts in the final City Council vote to approve 
the court-ordered housing plan. The vote came as the city reached the 
$1-million mark in fines levied by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand in 
Manhattan for the city's defiance of the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
Spallone is also one of the four council members who tallied individual fines 
totaling $3,500 each under the judge's punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court will 
decide during this term whether the fines violated the four council members' 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
A victory on the question of the fines against the council members, Spallone 
argues, eventually could lead to the unraveling of the entire housing 
desegregation plan, which calls for the construction of a total of 1,000 units 
of low- and moderate-income housing at scattered sites on Yonkers' East Side. 
</P>
<P>
The city has not progressed very far in fulfilling the housing plan. Seven 
sites have been selected for the first 150 units, Wasicsko said, but no 
construction is expected to take place until spring at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Black Yonkers residents, who make up less than 10% of the city's registered 
voters, are overwhelmingly opposed to Spallone's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"If Spallone wins, there's going to be a continuation of the squandering of the 
city's money to fight public housing desegregation and a continuation of 
Yonkers' poor public image," said Henry Joseph, first vice president of the 
local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.

LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE STRIKES 16 AT REUNION IN COLORADO; 3 DIE

<P>
An outbreak of legionnaire's disease at a 50th high school reunion was blamed 
Thursday for the deaths of three elderly celebrants and the pneumonia-like 
illness of 13 others. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials contacted 250 other people from 21 states who attended 
the Lamar High School reunion for the classes of 1937 through 1941 but found no 
new cases, Dr. Ellen Mangione, a Colorado Department of Health epidemiologist, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the disease has a four- to 10-day incubation period and the reunion was 
held in late September, Mangione said it is "not likely" that the outbreak will 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, she said, the health department recommended but so far is not 
enforcing temporary closure of the hotel where the reunion was held. 
</P>
<P>
However, the owner of the Cow Palace Inn in Lamar, about 200 miles southeast of 
Denver, said the facility would close voluntarily on Monday, while a team of 
health investigators tests the hotel's ventilation, heating and water systems 
in an attempt to trace the bacteria which causes legionnaire's disease. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials are consulting with the federal Centers for Disease 
Control, and the CDC is assisting in testing. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials are also contacting 12 other groups which held conventions at 
the Cow Palace in September and early October. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a potential for continuing risk, but we feel it's relatively small," 
Mangione said. "We're reevaluating it hourly and it's possible that we'll tell 
them to close before Monday." 
</P>
<P>
One of the 13 surviving victims remained hospitalized Thursday. Although 
laboratory results are back on only one of the 16 cases, Mangione said it is 
"exceedingly likely that all the others are legionnaire's disease." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has reported 37 individual cases of legionnaire's disease in the past 
five years but this is the first outbreak. Nationally, the disease is fatal in 
about 15% of the cases and can be effectively treated with antibiotics. 
Symptoms include high fever, headaches and loss of appetite. The disease is 
most common in men over 50, smokers and people in frail health. The Colorado 
victims were in their 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Lamar, Nancy Turner, told Denver's KUSA-TV Thursday night that "we 
don't think they caught it in Lamar . . . . They could have brought it with 
them. At least two of the people who were sick in Lamar had been very ill for 
several months." 
</P>
<P>
Mangione noted that there had been several outbreaks of legionnaire's disease 
across the country since the 1976 American Legion convention at the Bellevue 
Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in which 34 died, and the current Colorado 
outbreak "isn't one of the biggest."

The railroad engineer blamed for the deadliest train wreck in Amtrak history -- 
16 dead, at least 175 injured -- is seeking a reduction in his five-year 
sentence for manslaughter. Lawyers for Ricky Gates, the Conrail engineer who 
smoked marijuana shortly before his string of three locomotives strayed into 
the path of a speeding passenger train near Baltimore on Jan. 4., 1987, asked a 
Baltimore County circuit judge to reduce his time because of good behavior and 
to allow him to begin serving concurrently a three-year federal sentence for 
lying to investigators.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has split along partisan lines on the issue of 
whether to restore former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's $23,000 annual 
retirement pay, lost after he was convicted last May of shredding government 
documents. Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and six of his 
Democratic colleagues filed a report contending that Congress should take no 
action in North's case and leave it up to the Navy and the courts. But the 
committee's six Republicans dissented, saying the law that led to revocation of 
North's retirement pay was not intended to have such an effect.

ANGRY JUDGE IN MONTOYA CASE BERATES PROSECUTION

<P>
Preparing to preside over the political corruption trial of Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier), an angry federal judge on Thursday berated prosecutors 
for waiting until the last minute to amend the charges against the lawmaker and 
his former aide, Amiel A. Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Milton L. Schwartz accused the U.S. attorney's office here 
of being unfair to both defendants in the case when it asked for and got a 
revised grand jury indictment against the defendants last month, less than two 
months before their scheduled Dec. 4 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz pointed out that prosecutors led by U.S. Atty. David F. Levi have had 
since August, 1988 -- when federal agents raided the Capitol offices of Montoya 
and others -- to file their charges. 
</P>
<P>
"After all this time, we have some new ideas, we want some more," the judge 
said, referring to the revised indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think I'm angry, that's such an understatement, it's almost a lie," he 
said, adding, "We are playing games, folks, and you're not going to play games 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the amended indictment, Jaramillo's attorney asked for a delay in 
the start-up date for the trial. But Montoya and his lawyer have repeatedly 
said they want the case settled so that the senator can run for reelection next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz complained, "I am going to have to try this case twice," before 
agreeing to grant Jaramillo a delay and a separate trial. Montoya's case will 
stay on a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said in a brief interview with The Times that he was anxious to get the 
case behind him so he can mount an effective political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in my district support me," Montoya explained. "But the opinion 
makers want to see how this turns out." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and Jaramillo have been charged with a total of 16 counts of extortion, 
racketeering, bribery and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Montoya centers on a $3,000 honorarium he accepted in June, 
1988, from undercover FBI agents who were posing as businessmen and seeking 
support for special-interest bills that would benefit their phony company. The 
undercover agents were part of a 3 1/2-year federal sting operation called 
Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest).

<P>
LAKERS: THERE ARE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW THE TEAM WILL DO THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One popular view: 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are in trouble. They no longer have reliable Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and, essentially, they have not replaced him. They have about as much depth as 
a music video. Vlade Divac would have been more productive in the Yugoslav army 
reserve than as a Laker reserve. They will be lucky to win the Pacific 
Division, much less reclaim the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 Earvin (Magic) Johnson shakes his head and disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, people think we're going to fold it up and pack it in," the Laker 
guard said. "But that's not the case here. You can't count us out." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular view: 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers may never look better, as evidenced by their 8-0 exhibition record. 
They no longer have aged Abdul-Jabbar clogging the middle, meaning they can 
resurrect their fast break and offensive versatility. They are so deep Coach 
Pat Riley might even use his bench. Divac loses nothing in the translation or 
transition. Another NBA championship is probable. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson again shakes his head and disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to predict things like that," he said. "We know we are one of the 
best teams. But we have to go out and play hard every night. If we work hard, 
the wins will come." 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, no one is sure what to make of the Lakers this season, their first in 
15 years without the looming presence of Abdul-Jabbar at center. 
</P>
<P>
This uncertainty adds some mystery to the Lakers' regular season, which 
traditionally has been little more than an 82-game tuneup for the playoffs. 
Starting tonight in Dallas, the Lakers will start discovering what type of team 
they have become entering the post-Kareem '90s. 
</P>
<P>
While the Lakers could go either way, they most likely will fall somewhere 
between those two extreme predictions as the season unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
They will not be a physically imposing team, not with Mychal Thompson as the 
starting center and Yugoslav import Divac as his backup. Unless the Lakers 
acquire another aggressive big man -- the team's salary-cap limitation 
precludes most deals -- even Mark McNamara may see meaningful minutes against 
bigger opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers will be as quick and as versatile as any team in the league. 
Johnson can, and probably will, play point guard one minute, then power forward 
or center the next. Michael Cooper is now almost exclusively a forward. A.C. 
Green will play some time at center. 
</P>
<P>
When Riley finally accepted that the Lakers would not acquire Rick Mahorn or 
sign Wayne Cooper or find any other "true" center to replace Abdul-Jabbar, he 
set out to redefine the Lakers' style and substance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the team we've got," Riley said. "I'm maybe a little 
disappointed we didn't get Ricky Mahorn, but I'm satisfied with our players." 
</P>
<P>
Riley has reintroduced the five-man fast break -- no hanging back at midcourt 
for the center -- and restructured the offense so that each player is involved 
and most of the low-post plays are set up for James Worthy and Johnson. 
Defensively, the Lakers promise to trap the player with the ball more 
aggressively than before and to take more chances. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely made things different," Johnson said of Riley. "He's 
maximizing the talent we have now. He's trying different things. He's put in a 
whole different defensive scheme. He's taken advantage of our quickness. I 
think he took a long hard look at what's going on, what the change is going to 
be in the '90s and adjusted to that." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Lakers had begun to prepare for Life After Kareem while 
Abdul-Jabbar was still around. Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged a career-low 10.1 
points a game last season, was the third or fourth offensive option most of the 
time, and sometimes was waved out of the post altogether. Thompson averaged 
more minutes and almost more points than Abdul-Jabbar last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley said the Lakers will definitely miss Abdul-Jabbar in certain 
situations, such as when the 24-second clock dwindles below 10 and that 
reliable sky hook is no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
"Kareem was always the last leg of our offense," Riley said. "We can't rely 
anymore on just putting the ball above our heads, standing around and throwing 
it inside to him. But we're working on that." 
</P>
<P>
Laker scoring this season figures to come from the same players who provided it 
last season. Johnson averaged 22 points a game on his way to becoming the 
league's most valuable player. Worthy averaged 20.5 and off-guard Byron Scott 
19.6. 
</P>
<P>
"The only conscious thing I'm working on without Kareem is posting up," Worthy 
said. "I have to make sure we have that scoring from down there. But A.C. and 
Earvin will post low, too." 
</P>
<P>
More shots figure to be available with Abdul-Jabbar gone and the Lakers pushing 
the ball instead of grinding out the clock, so Riley said he expects more 
offensive production from Green and Thompson, as well as from Orlando Woolridge 
(once he returns from a knee injury, probably in early December), Cooper, point 
guard Larry Drew and Divac off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not get that many more shots than last year, but more of a distribution 
of shots," Scott said. "There's more people to go to now. A.C. will take more 
shots. Mychal, too. So, we don't need Magic, James and myself to each score 22 
(points) every game. 
</P>
<P>
"If we really run like we want to, then we'll all be scoring. But like Riley 
told us, we can't run with people, we have to run by them." 
</P>
<P>
Riley has run the Lakers ragged in the 11 days between the end of the 
exhibition season and tonight's first game. He said the Lakers need to be in 
better cardiovascular shape than before to maintain the brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want is five guys always moving and working together," Riley said. 
"Everybody has to develop the skills to get us a good shot. We can't get caught 
in a grinding type of game. As soon as I see them get lethargic on offense, I'm 
going to put them in a different defense and generate offense off the defense, 
a switching and trapping defense." 
</P>
<P>
Against teams with a tall, bulky and talented center, such as the Houston 
Rockets' Akeem Olajuwon and the New York Knicks' Patrick Ewing or even the 
Mavericks' James Donaldson, the Lakers still will be at a disadvantage. Riley's 
answer is to play hard-nosed team defense, send as many players as possible to 
rebound and hope to wear teams down. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "What we have to do is put a lot of pressure on teams, stay up in 
their chests and use our quickness to our advantage. We aren't as big as a lot 
of teams, so we can't let their size get to our quickness. Our quickness has to 
get to their size first. Dallas is going to be the start of that. They are big, 
so we're going to have to get after people, trap a lot, do things to disrupt 
teams' offense." 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, though, Johnson believes that the Lakers need another "big 
body," as he terms it, off the bench for rebounding and defensive muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"Vlade doesn't fit that bill," Johnson said. "He's long (7-foot-1), but he's 
not big. Mel (McCants, a 6-foot-9, 250-pound rookie) would be great if he were 
three inches taller. All I want is someone who can give us size and some 
boards. If we don't get anyone, we go with what we got. Mel can still play, and 
Vlade can do some good things for us." 
</P>
<P>
Divac's role is not fully defined. But he will have a role, which is more than 
Riley thought at the start of training camp. Although he is 7-1, Divac's play 
resembles that of a power forward. He is a sure ball-handler, possesses a fine 
shooting touch and has good inside moves. But he is weak on defense in the low 
post and positioning for rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Because Divac has developed into more than just a new cult figure for Forum 
fans, Riley has expanded his substitution pattern from eight to nine players. 
</P>
<P>
Drew, the 31-year-old veteran free agent, will play significant minutes at 
point guard, so Johnson can either rest or play on the front line. The addition 
of Drew also allows Cooper to switch from point guard, where he is shaky, to 
small forward. Once he rehabilitates his right knee, Woolridge will spell 
Worthy at small forward. Until then, rookie Steve Bucknall will play some 
minutes. And Divac will replace Thompson or Green. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we can go to nine (players)," Riley said. "But I still don't 
like to roll over too many guys. It's better to give one guy 12 minutes than 
two guys six. You know what they say -- use seven, play six and trust five. I 
think Vlade will play significant minutes. Of course, it depends on his 
performance. He's still learning." 
</P>
<P>
Riley figures to learn more about the Lakers, and perhaps alter his tactics on 
the fly, as the season progresses. But Riley still likes his team's chances, 
because of what he calls the Lakers' "core of four," consisting of Johnson, 
Worthy, Scott and Green. 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as Magic is breathing, you still have the Lakers to beat," Phoenix Sun 
Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said it is his goal this season to breath new life into the Lakers by 
being a different kind of MVP -- most versatile player. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning all four or five positions," Johnson said. "My game will change 
in that aspect. I'm going to have (the ball) a lot, but I'm not going to have 
it a lot, too. It's going to be a big change for me. In practice (one day last 
week), Riley didn't allow me to touch the ball. I just played forward. I have 
to learn that. It makes us more effective as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Just how effective the Lakers, the so-called Team of the '80s, will be at the 
outset of the '90s should start to become apparent tonight.

CLIPPERS: IT'S HARD TO TELL JUST HOW THEY WILL DO, AND NOBODY IS MAKING ANY 
PREDICTIONS.

<P>
Still the Clippers after all these years, they've apparently grown tired of 
great expectations, even the young players who have known only one last-place, 
multi-coach season. 
</P>
<P>
So this time will be different, in approach if nothing else. What happens after 
that happens. The time for bravado and ticket-selling proclamations passed 
months ago, probably about the time the 21-61 season of 1988-89 was finishing. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say things like, 'We're going to do this,' and 'We're confident,' 
like people do before every season," said forward Charles Smith, an NBA 
all-rookie selection in 1988-89. "I'm tired of saying it as much as people are 
tired of hearing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes real repetitious saying the same thing over and over. I'd just like 
to remain quiet and just play and let people watch us and decide how things are 
for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the most impressive Clipper during training camp, is not alone in his 
sentiment. The closest any player will stray near a bold statement is to say 
that they plan to be in contention for a playoff spot. Coach Don Casey, who saw 
the high hopes of last season turn into another in a long line of disasters, 
refuses even to speculate on that goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I make no predictions," he said. "All we can promise is effort and 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
So, for the team that always seems to have more questions than answers, here 
are a few more at the dawning of 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Who are the starters? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Gary Grant and Reggie Williams at guard, Smith and Ken Norman at 
forward, and Joe Wolf at center. When -- if? -- Benoit Benjamin shows, he'll 
replace Wolf, providing some much needed depth on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the additions to a team that recorded a third consecutive 
last-place finish and four road wins? 
</P>
<P>
A: Two second-round draft picks (Jeff Martin and Jay Edwards) and three free 
agents (Carlton McKinney, Michael Young and Torgeir Bryn). Edwards will open on 
the injured list, where he may remain for a while, and another free agent, 
Andre Turner, has been brought in. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is expected? 
</P>
<P>
A: Danny Manning. The target for his return from knee surgery remains the end 
of December or early January, which, if true, would work out nicely. The 
Clippers open a marathon eight-game trip on Jan. 2, and having Manning in tow 
would be a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to that point we have to play strong without him to be in position when he 
does come back to make the playoffs, or at least make a run," said Grant, who 
last season led all rookies in assists and steals. "As soon as he gets back, 
we'll win a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who else might show? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ponce de Leon. That is the Fountain of Youth hidden somewhere inside the 
Sports Arena, right? 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly maturing to where they one day will be a group of veterans, the 
Clippers are instead getting collectively younger. The opening-day roster last 
season had an average of 2.25 years NBA experience, while this team enters at 
1.42, and that's with the late addition of Turner in place of Edwards and 
giving Young credit for two full years when he actually played only a pair of 
games each season. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who are the veterans? 
</P>
<P>
A: Benjamin has four years' experience, but he's not in much of a position now 
to provide leadership. Ken Bannister has three years of NBA experience, but 
only nine games in the last three seasons. Take away Turner, and nobody else is 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So what of Benjamin? 
</P>
<P>
A: What appeared to be a done deal of a contract after his return from Italy 
has turned into anything but. It's turned into a process so slow that one of 
the negotiators said, "It's like stirring cement with an eyelash." 
</P>
<P>
The holdup appears to be over incentives, with the Clippers pushing for more 
contingency money and Team Benjamin looking for more guaranteed dollars. The 
proceedings have dragged on long enough for the players' union to get involved 
in the background, making itself available to Benjamin's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA Players Assn. views Benjamin in his official status, as a restricted 
free agent. But since he has not signed an offer sheet from another team, the 
fifth-year center remains Clipper property, which means if he plays anywhere, 
he plays here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is someone who has caused his team so much frustration really worth all 
this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, to the Clippers. Beyond the fact that he can be one of the dominating 
centers in the league, Benjamin is all they have. If Manning were healthy or 
Danny Ferry a Clipper, it might be full-speed ahead with a three-forward 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
But since he isn't and he's not . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: There is no first-round draft choice. The No. 1 pick from last season is 
still mending. Quintin Dailey is gone, and his average of 16.1 points a game 
has not been replaced. Why, then, is there any optimism, not to mention a 
realistic chance to step up from the cellar? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several reasons: Smith's exhibition season and his showing while 
healthy last season. Norman coming off a season when he emerged as the team's 
most consistent player. Grant's performance down the stretch, when he stopped 
trying fancy highlight-film passes and settled down and played well without so 
much glitter. Casey being pleased with the exhibition play of Williams. Backup 
guard Tom Garrick, a fine defensive player as a rookie, becoming more 
aggressive on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Having won over the players long ago, who else does Casey plan to get 
excited about the Clippers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Put it this way -- the Clippers have 2 1/2 days in Washington before playing 
the Bullets Feb. 8, and an invitation will be going to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll invite him," Casey said. "I'll make him a Clipper fan." 
</P>
<P>
Are you listening, President Bush? 
</P>
<P>
Heck, they're old friends. OK, one-time acquaintances. Casey, then a Clipper 
assistant, and former Clipper Coach Don Chaney met the then-vice president 
three years ago during a similar East Coast trip, having coffee and talking 
with Bush for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The connection went back to Casey's first coaching job, at Bishop Eustace Prep 
in New Jersey. A student manager there became part of Bush's Secret Service 
team, and through him Casey met an assistant to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
And they have something in common. Casey's first day in charge of the Clippers 
last season as interim coach was Jan. 20, the same day Bush was inaugurated. 
So, of course, the president will have time for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What Clipper is getting the most attention back home? 
</P>
<P>
A: Bryn, a 6-foot-9 forward from Oslo, by way of MiraCosta College in Oceanside 
and Southwest Texas State. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone interested in sports in Norway has been rooting for him," said Aud 
Berggren, the Los Angeles correspondent for VG, the country's largest daily. 
"His name has been all over the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it has been his dream to play pro basketball since he was 15. But you 
don't go around in Norway saying how you are going to be great some day. You 
will get a bang on the head." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any guarantees that this season will be different from the past? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. For the first time in six years, the Clippers open at home, tonight 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, no guarantees.

NEWSWIRE: NEWSPAPER SAYS PINIELLA TO MANAGE CINCINNATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lou Piniella, an adviser with the New York Yankees, has accepted the managerial 
position with the Cincinnati Reds, according to the Dayton Daily News in 
today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying Piniella, 46, has agreed to a 
two-year, $350,000-a-year contract, $50,000 less than he would have earned had 
he stayed with the Yankees where he twice served as manager. He also was the 
team's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella would replace Pete Rose, who was forced to leave the team in midseason 
when he was suspended from baseball by former Commissioner Bart Giamatti.

Mary Jane Visser testified in Lincoln, Neb., that she took confidential 
information on athletes from the University of Nebraska files before she was 
fired as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Visser, who claims she was fired because she was investigating student 
athletes' records, told a U.S. District Court jury that she began keeping track 
of items that seemed irregular. She said some players who participated in the 
1988 Fiesta Bowl had flunked out of school the previous semester. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit against the university, Visser is seeking damages for lost wages 
and emotional distress along with reinstatement to her job. 
</P>
<P>
University officials contend Visser was fired after 19 years on the Nebraska 
payroll because of poor job performance. They contend she began to investigate 
student records only after her work habits were criticized.

BREEDERS' CUP: ENGLISH HORSES HAVE MADE DISMAL SHOWINGS.

<P>
The British are coming, the British are coming. This has frequently been the 
cry in the Breeders' Cup, but it has largely been a study in frustration for 
them. Riders such as Jose Santos and Ray Sibille, rather than Paul Revere, are 
now getting there ahead of the British. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Pebbles, that stout-swilling filly, won a Breeders' Cup race once, at 
Aqueduct in 1985, but Santos beat Dancing Brave, England's 1-2 favorite, with 
Manila at Santa Anita in 1986, and Sibille rode Great Communicator to victory 
last year at Churchill Downs, where Indian Skimmer, at 6-5, finished third. And 
the crowning blow to Britain's hopes came in 1987 and 1988, when that French 
filly, Miesque, beat two of their highly regarded milers in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
These demoralizing losses have made the English understandably gun-shy as they 
go into the sixth Breeders' Cup Saturday at Gulfstream Park, even though they 
have Zilzal, an undefeated 3-year-old colt, running as the favorite in the Turf 
Mile. In the other grass race, the 1 1/2-mile Turf, the British are running 
three horses, the best of which is Ile de Chypre. 
</P>
<P>
"With the sole, unforgettable exception of Pebbles . . . the British record at 
the (Breeders' Cup) meeting has been a catalogue of flops," English reporter 
Greg Wood wrote. "Dancing Brave, Indian Skimmer and Warning have all failed to 
live up to their hype, to the poorly disguised glee of the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Warning, now a 4-year-old, was a 19-10 favorite when he finished ahead of only 
one horse at Churchill Downs last year, as Miesque won the Mile for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Guy Harwood has Warning entered in the Mile again Saturday, but the 
presence of Zilzal, Warning's poor recent form and the colt's unsettling trip 
here compromise his victory chances severely. In fact, there was a good chance 
Wednesday that Warning would be scratched, but after looking at the horse after 
his release from quarantine Thursday, Harwood said he would not make a decision 
until today. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood was not happy with the pilot who flew seven horses from England into 
Miami International Airport Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He revved up the engines just as they were landing," he said. "He must have 
thought he was flying a passenger plane instead of a load of horses." 
</P>
<P>
Warning was jolted, and his legs wound up going over the front of his stall. 
With little balance, he badly skinned his right foreleg, which was bruised and 
swollen. The injury improved Thursday and the lameness was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood is running Ile de Chypre, another 4-year-old colt, in the Turf. Ile de 
Chypre, who has two wins, three seconds and a third in his last six starts, 
lost a race under mysterious circumstances last year at Royal Ascot. With the 
lead about 100 yards from home, he suddenly veered to the left and threw his 
jockey, Greville Starkey. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark, who rode Ile de Chypre to victory in the Juddmonte International, a 
major 1 5/16-mile race in England in late August, has the mount Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony this week in London, a car dealer was said to have used an 
ultrasonic gun, which looked like a pair of binoculars, to send a high-pitched 
sound from the grandstand, causing Ile de Chypre to duck in and unseat Starkey. 
Betting on the race was alleged to have been part of a million-dollar scheme to 
launder drug money at racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Harwood was reluctant to discuss the strange Royal Ascot race, 
because it is not relevant to the Breeders' Cup. He did say, however, that 
Starkey couldn't explain Ile de Chypre's behavior, and a post-race examination 
of the horse showed nothing physically wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood epitomizes Britain's failures in the Breeders' Cup. Besides Dancing 
Brave and Warning, he has started three other horses in the rich races, and 
that trio's best finish has been a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a learning curve as far as the Breeders' Cup is concerned," Harwood 
said. "What I've learned, for one thing, is to bring horses over here closer to 
the race. In Florida, for instance, there was no hurry to get them here, 
because they're going to be subjected to enough heat as it is." 
</P>
<P>
When the English horses left home, the temperature was in the 50s, but when 
they arrived in Miami, it was a humid 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Timing has everything to do with winning a Breeders' Cup race," Harwood said. 
"Miesque was at the height of her game both times here. One of the differences 
between our racing and the American game is that the horses here run faster 
earlier. A lot of times, the first two quarter-miles will be run faster than 
the last two. Our horses lose a lot of the races here coming out of the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood thought Warning did badly at Churchill Downs because of the soft turf. 
"That was terrible ground," Harwood said. "It was diabolical." 
</P>
<P>
Zilzal, trained by Michael Stoute, is the 9-5 morning-line favorite in the 
Mile, but he has these negatives to overcome -- the heat, an outside post 
position (No. 10 in a 13-horse field), a grass course with no banked turns, and 
a tendency to lather up before his races, even in temperate weather. 
</P>
<P>
Stoute has had seven Breeders' Cup starters, with only a pair of thirds to show 
for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this horse washes out, but I take no notice of it," Stoute said of 
Zilzal. "He's just a free-sweating horse, and it hasn't affected his races. 
Rather than say he's sweating, I'd like to say that he's just leaking. I know 
the atmosphere will be electric, and we've got the humidity, too. And our horse 
has only trained, but never run, on a course with left-handed turns. So there 
are a lot of things against him, but we're still going to give it a go." 
</P>
<P>
None of the European trainers are mentioning it, but their horses usually run 
without medication, which is banned over there but partially legal in Florida, 
where analgesics and diuretics are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The English press might be apologetic about the way their horses run here, but 
they wear their medication policy on their sleeves. "Many of the American 
horses," Wood wrote, "will have enough drugs coursing through their veins to 
arouse the attention of the Miami Vice, a situation that casts a cheapening 
light on what should be a glorious celebration of racing." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Dancer, 20-1 in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, will run for new owners 
Saturday, and there's been a trainer switch from Jerry Robb to Darrell Vienna. 
. . . Only three jockeys -- Laffit Pincay, Angel Cordero and Gary Stevens -- 
will have mounts in all seven Breeders' Cup races. . . . France's Lashkari paid 
$108.80 to win in the 1984 Breeders' Cup Turf, which is still a record mutuel 
for the series. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite has won only one of the five races in the Mile and the Sprint. 
Favorites have won all but one of the five Distaffs. Favorites have won twice 
each in the Classic, the Turf, the Juvenile and the Juvenile Fillies. . . . 
There was no rain Thursday, and after a 30% chance of showers today, the 
forecast for Saturday is partly cloudy, with temperatures in the mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
Zilzal will be ridden by Walter Swinburn. . . . Michael Stoute, Zilzal's 
trainer, said he would like to switch post positions with trainer Wayne Lukas, 
whose Steinlen is No. 2. Steinlen finished second to Miesque last year. . . . 
Pat Eddery, who won with Pebbles, has the mount on Warning. . . . Steve 
Cauthen, who has a commitment to ride in England Saturday, was supposed to ride 
Green Line Express in the Breeders' Cup Mile, but now the assignment goes to 
Craig Perret. Cauthen is winless in seven Breeders' Cup races.

STICKY WILE EQUALS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sticky Wile equaled an American record of 1:32 3/5 for one mile on the turf in 
recording a 5 1/2-length victory in the $42,000 allowance feature at Oak Tree 
meeting at Santa Anita Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sticky Wile, a 3-year-old filly, was ridden by apprentice Corey Nakatani under 
109 pounds and paid $4.60 to win as the favorite. The time equaled the American 
turf record set by Royal Heroine in the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1984 at Hollywood 
Park. The clocking was two-fifths of a second off the world record of 1:32 1/5 
for one mile set by Dr. Fager on the dirt at Arlington Park in Chicago in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Sticky Wile, third much of the way, forged to the lead around the far turn and 
drew off in the stretch. Thanks Tissar finished second, a head in front of 
Attend To Detail, in the field of eight.

SAN DIEGO RELIEVER MARK DAVIS IS CARRYING AN ADDED BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly four months, Mark Davis had kept this grim secret to himself. His 
teammates had no clue. His manager, Jack McKeon, never knew. Not even his best 
friends were told. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want people feeling sorry for me," said Davis, the Padres' star 
relief pitcher. "I knew if it ever came out during the season, everyone would 
be consoling me and asking me about it. And I just didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with reporters, agents and attorneys telephoning his house at all hours 
since Monday night, when he filed for free agency, Davis has asked to have his 
privacy respected. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he wants to trivialize the importance of where he will pitch next 
season, but at this particular time, Davis couldn't care less if he throws 
another ball the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that his father is dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
And after months of praying and hoping that these new experimental treatments 
would work, Davis has acknowledged reality. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, I refused to believe it," Davis said, his voice cracking, 
"but now I know he's going to die." 
</P>
<P>
The tumor in Kenneth Davis was discovered three years ago. It was diagnosed as 
prostate cancer. The family was told not to be alarmed, and after radiation 
treatments kept the tumor from enlarging, the Davis family was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We always kept a positive outlook, believing it would go away," Davis said. 
"My mother is deeply religious, and I think we all had faith everything would 
be all right." 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this year, the cancer began spreading. It raced through his 
father's thighs, chest and finally, to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark and I really didn't know how bad it was," said Candy Davis, Mark's wife, 
"because they really downplayed it. When we saw him in April, he looked good, 
sounded good and felt good. When he had his bad days, they always told us he 
had a cold or he had the flu or something else like that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they didn't want Mark to know; they wanted to spare him." 
</P>
<P>
Davis indeed pitched as if he didn't have a care in the world. He recorded a 
save in each of his first 11 appearances and had 22 saves by the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
When he was informed in July that he was selected to the National League 
All-Star team by Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, he immediately was on the phone to 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make the All-Star team more than anything I've ever wanted," Davis 
said, "because I knew it might be the last time my dad would ever see me pitch 
in one. Since the All-Star game was in Anaheim and my folks live in Sacramento, 
I thought my dad would feel strong enough to make it." 
</P>
<P>
But it was at the All-Star game that Davis learned just how ill his father had 
become. He had lost 25 pounds since Mark had last seen him in April, and the 
cancer had stripped away most of his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him a day before the All-Star game," Candy said, "and I couldn't believe 
it. I was shocked. He had gone so far downhill in just two months. I really 
didn't know if he could even make it to the game." 
</P>
<P>
With the All-Star workout during the day Monday and festivities at night, Mark 
never had the opportunity to see his father until Tuesday, after the game. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Candy had been able to prepare him for the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Mark, your dad's been sick lately,' "Candy said. " 'He's lost a lot 
of weight. He's very weak.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis, 63, was so weak, in fact, that he nearly missed the chance to 
see his son pitch. He was taken to a first-aid station after the first inning 
and lay on a cot for several innings until he regained his strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the excitement, the heat and everything just got to him," Candy said. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Davis, ignoring the advice of the nurses and first-aid attendants, 
refused to be detoured now. He did not travel nine hours to listen on the radio 
as his son pitched in an All-Star game. If Mark was going to be pitching, he 
was going to be right there watching him. 
</P>
<P>
When Mark entered the game in the sixth inning, there his father was, sitting 
on the edge of his seat. There could not have been a prouder father, either, 
when Mark pitched a one-two-three inning, including a strikeout of Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, to this day, he still talks about the time Mark struck out Bo 
Jackson," Candy said. "It just thrilled him so much." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, when Mark saw his father, and the deterioration that the cancer 
had caused, his eyes watered but he kept himself from crying. It wasn't until 
later, after he was alone with his wife, that he broke down. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I never had anyone close to me die before," Davis said. "I had a 
grandmother who died when I was young, but I really didn't know her too well. I 
think she was 94 or 96. 
</P>
<P>
"But my dad, he's only 63. He hasn't had a chance to see my daughters (ages 3 
years and 7 months) grow up, develop their own personalities. It just doesn't 
seem fair." 
</P>
<P>
The original plan this off-season, Davis said, was to spend as much time as 
possible with his father, allowing his daughters time to know their grandfather 
before he no longer is around. 
</P>
<P>
Last week changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
His father was admitted to intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
Davis took the first flight to Sacramento and stayed with his father until 
Tuesday morning. He took a flight to Phoenix to be with his kids for Halloween 
and then returned to Sacramento to be with his father for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I even saw one inning of these last two games of the World 
Series," Davis said, "it's just been so hectic. The whole family was there, and 
I spent a lot of nights with my dad in the hospital. There's so much to do now, 
a lot of business that needs to be taken care of. I've got to . . . " 
</P>
<P>
His voice broke off. 
</P>
<P>
All of the baseball experience in the world doesn't teach one how to prepare 
for death. "That's the hardest part," Candy said. "We all know it's inevitable 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis was given permission to go home Wednesday. A hospital bed was 
awaiting. The family has gathered by his side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through," Mark Davis said. "All of 
the pain my father is going through right now, I just wish I could take some of 
it away from him." 
</P>
<P>
During the season, it seemed so easy. All his father had asked was for Davis to 
concentrate on being the best relief pitcher in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Davis did just that, posting a major league-leading 44 saves. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very hard time for Mark," Candy said, "because he was constantly 
worrying about his dad. But it was like the game was an outlet for him. When he 
crossed that white line, he was able to concentrate on baseball and forget for 
a little while about the other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, of course, no one's thinking about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Davis apologized to the Padres and their fans, who are anxiously waiting for 
him to decide where he'll pitch next season. But they'll have to wait a little 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the people of San Diego understand," Davis said, "but I'm really not in 
the mood to think about that stuff right now. I'd like to see something worked 
out between us and the Padres, but there are a lot of things that will enter my 
decision. Money definitely will not be the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time, and maybe the only time, I'll ever be a free agent. I 
just want to be able to explore all my options and see what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that right now, I don't have time to think about it. It's just not 
that important to me right now."

HENDERSON OPTS FOR FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickey Henderson filed for free agency Thursday, five days after leading the 
Oakland Athletics to their first World Series championship in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, the A's left fielder, who was the most valuable player of the 
American League playoffs, returned to his hometown of Oakland on June 20 when 
the New York Yankees traded him for pitchers Eric Plunk and Greg Caderet and 
outfielder Luis Polonia. His agent, Richie Bry, said Thursday that Henderson's 
first choice was to re-sign with the A's, the team he began with in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other players filed Thursday, increasing the number of free agents to 55. 
Also filing were Bob Brenly, Mike Krukow and Candy Maldonado of the National 
League champion San Francisco Giants; Bob Forsch, Greg Gross and Dan Schatzeder 
of the Houston Astros; Frank DiPino of the St. Louis Cardinals; Sal Butera of 
the Toronto Blue Jays; and Don Aase of the New York Mets. A total of 116 
players are eligible for free agency and they have until Nov. 13 to file. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson rejected a $7.2-million, three-year offer from the Yankees before 
they traded him to Oakland. He is believed to be asking for more than $3 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a meeting scheduled with Sandy Alderson on the 15th of November in San 
Francisco," Bry said. "I would say that all things being equal, Rickey 
certainly would like to stay in Oakland and finish his career there. His home 
is there and his family is there. This may be his last major contract and so he 
has to capitalize on it for his family." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson hit .247 with the Yankees with 25 stolen bases. With the A's, he 
batted .294 with 52 stolen bases in 58 attempts. He stole eight bases in the 
playoffs and three more in the World Series, batting nine for 19 against San 
Francisco with a double, a triple and a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a starting figure, which I'm not going to disclose, and I have a rather 
set pattern of dealing with free agents, which I think is extremely fair to the 
home club if the player wants to go back," Bry said. "I do not try to create a 
bidding war. That's not my philosophy of doing a free-agent contract. "Once you 
begin discussions with other clubs, it's not shopping. If some club meets a 
predetermined figure, which may be higher and which may not be, then the player 
signs. You don't run back and forth trying to run one club against the other." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said two weeks ago that he might go back to the Yankees for the right 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time in New York," he said. "I would consider going back, but I 
hope I'm back here." 
</P>
<P>
Bry said Thursday that Henderson would deal only with Oakland for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned," Bry said, "I'm glad to give Sandy whatever time he 
feels he needs."

French May Aid British Rail Link: France might consider subsidizing a 
high-speed rail link in Britain to ensure that the Channel Tunnel is a success, 
French state-owned railway SNCF said. A spokesman said SNCF was prepared to 
consider financial support for the building of the 68-mile upgraded line, which 
is considered crucial to cutting rail travel time between London and Paris to 2 
1/2 hours.

Tracor to Sell Units: Tracor Inc., an Austin, Tex.-based defense electronics 
company owned by Westmark Systems Inc., said it will sell its instruments and 
aviation systems units as part of a restructuring plan approved by its debt 
holders. No sale price was disclosed. Proceeds will be used to reduce the 
company's outstanding debt of $747 million. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will 
manage the sale. Much of the debt was incurred when Westmark, a holding 
company, acquired Tracor in a leveraged buyout in October, 1987. If the 
divestiture is completed, Tracor will be left with the components group.

Fine Proposed for Drexel's Spanish Unit: Spain's National Securities Commission 
has recommended the Spanish unit of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. be fined the 
maximum amount for fraudulent trading practices. The watchdog agency 
recommended that DBL Capital Markets Espana SA be fined $556,725 (65 million 
pesetas) or five times the amount of the operation's gross profits, which is 
the maximum fine under law. The Spanish branch of the U.S. securities firm was

Help-Wanted Ads Level Off: The volume of help-wanted ads appearing in the 
nation's newspapers is holding steady, an indication that job growth is not 
likely to fall in the near future, according to a Conference Board report. In 
September, the board's help-wanted advertising index registered 145, down 1 
point from August and 8 points lower than the year-earlier period. The 
Conference Board tracks want-ad volume in 51 major newspapers and contends that 
want ads are a proven barometer of changes in the supply of jobs.

PRODUCTIVITY RATE MAKES A FEEBLE GAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's manufacturing productivity improved at an anemic 1.4% annual rate 
in the third quarter, with output gains at a three-year low and unit labor 
costs rising at the fastest rate since the 1982 recession, the Labor Department 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy 
was up at an annual rate of 2.1% in the July-September period, nearly double 
the revised 1.1% annual rate gain posted in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But that improvement was overshadowed by other data in the report suggesting 
that the manufacturing slump is far from over and that wage inflation remains 
stubborn despite a recent moderation in consumer price increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing is clearly soft," said David Wyss of the DRI-McGraw Hill 
forecasting firm. "The economy is slowing down, and that is going to be felt 
disproportionately by manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
Added Merrill Lynch's Donald Straszheim: "Manufacturing is not likely to 
improve much until well into next year." 
</P>
<P>
The 1.4% annual rate gain in manufacturing productivity in the third quarter 
was off dramatically from the revised second-quarter improvement of 3.7%. The 
third-quarter number represented the smallest productivity increase since the 
fourth quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Output in manufacturing was up just 1.3% at an annual rate in the third quarter 
-- its smallest gain since 1986 -- and hours worked in American factories 
declined 0.1% at an annual rate after falling a revised 0.2% in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
September unemployment data showed a 103,000 drop in manufacturing employment, 
a sign to analysts that manufacturers were trying to cut costs and boost 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
But the outlook remains bleak for the next several months, the analysts said, 
because rising unit labor costs will exacerbate the already unfavorable 
position most U.S. manufacturers find themselves in in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Labor Department said unit labor costs rose at a rapid 4.5% annual 
rate in the third quarter after falling at a revised annual rate of 1% in the 
second quarter. It was the largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in 
manufacturing since a 9.7% annual gain in the first quarter of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The overall numbers for the non-farm sector were somewhat more encouraging but 
still underscored the recent economic slowdown and the persistent upward 
pressure on wages. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.1% annual-rate non-farm productivity gain resulted from a 3.1% rise in 
output and just a 1% gain in hours worked. The increase in hours worked was the 
lowest in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly compensation in the entire non-farm sector rose at an annual rate of 
5.3% in the non-farm sector, down from the second quarter annual-rate gain of 
5.6% but still evidence of underlying inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is still a very serious problem," said Elliott Platt, a senior vice 
president at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
The productivity gain helped offset the impact of wage gains on unit labor 
costs in the overall non-farm sector. They increased at an annual rate of 3.2% 
in the third quarter after rising at a revised 4.5% in the second quarter.

CHEVRON STOCK DIPS AS TRADERS TIRE OF RUMORS;

TAKEOVERS: RECENT HEAVY TRADING SET OFF SPECULATION ABOUT POSSIBLE SUITORS. BUT

Shares of Chevron Corp. dipped Thursday as skepticism grew about takeover 
rumors spurred by weeks of heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of hard information on who has been buying up Chevron shares had 
prompted analysts and traders to speculate that everyone from Pennzoil Co. to 
British Petroleum to the Kuwaitis was snapping up Chevron shares. 
</P>
<P>
The buzz drove up the stock's closing price as high as $68.375 on Wednesday. 
But on Thursday, the stock fell 37.5 cents to $68 a share on volume of 
1,692,300 shares, making it the fifth most heavily traded issue on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

The rumor with the most credibility, at least among analysts, held that 
Pennzoil was buying Chevron's undervalued shares through third parties, with 
$2.5 billion in cash from its settlement with Texaco Inc. in the battle for 
Getty Oil Co. Analysts had speculated that Pennzoil might be girding for an 
all-out takeover or a forced restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, analysts were doubting that relatively small Pennzoil 
could muster the wherewithal to make a full-fledged run at the West Coast 
energy giant -- a proposition that would cost as much as $35 billion or $40 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a minnow trying to swallow a shark," said one trader. 
</P>
<P>
Marc D. Cohen, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, agreed. 
"For analysts who deal with Pennzoil, none of them seem to believe it," he 
said. "That's not to say realistically that Pennzoil did not build a position 
in the thing to play stock market. . . . (But) they could have already got 
out." 
</P>
<P>
So far, no one knows for sure who has been buying Chevron shares, and Chevron 
and Pennzoil have declined to comment on the activity. No one has bought more 
than 5%, which would trigger Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts haven't discounted the possibility that Pennzoil could find a partner 
-- possibly British Petroleum, which has said it wants to increase its West 
Coast presence. But even that would require substantial financing, hardly a 
sure thing in the current market. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, British Petroleum executives last month told analysts in New York 
that the company was entering a period of consolidation and would probably hold 
off any acquisitions that would strain the company's debt-equity ratio. A BP 
spokesman declined to comment on Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ting, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., offered the newest twist on 
the Pennzoil rumor: The company is likely to buy just enough Chevron shares to 
protect it from paying as much as $800 million in taxes on the Texaco 
settlement, making use of an as-yet untested interpretation of tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid paying taxes on the settlement, which arose from an abortive bid for 
Getty, Pennzoil must invest it in assets of "like kind" by the end of 1990. He 
pointed to Pennzoil's earlier purchase of shares in Burlington Resources as an 
example of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
What is unclear is whether Chevron stock would qualify, Ting said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pennzoil spokesman acknowledged that the company had considered investing in 
assets similar to Getty to avoid tax liabilities. But he declined to go into 
details or say whether the company had been buying Chevron shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts such as Cohen doubt such a gambit would work, particularly since a 
minority stake in Chevron would not compare to the major interest Pennzoil had 
sought in Getty. "A company could own 20% of (Chevron) stock and still not have 
a board position . . . so the validity of that in tax court would not hold very 
much water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for any restructuring by Chevron, the company may not have enough cash for a 
major stock buyback or dividend payment, especially since it paid mostly cash 
in its $2.6-billion deal to buy Tenneco oil and gas reserves last year, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron stock remains attractive to investors, analysts said. Most place a 
breakup value of more than $100 per share on Chevron stock, which began 
climbing last month. Chevron has traded as low as $43.125 in the last year.

RETAILERS' SALES UP MODESTLY IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's large retailers on Thursday reported modest to good October sales 
with apparel stores doing better than general merchandise chains that depend 
heavily on sales of expensive durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Sack, a retail analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., summed up the 
month this way: "It was OK. It wasn't a disaster, but it wasn't great." 
</P>
<P>
Clothing retailers rang up better results than general merchandisers, such as 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., that have a large proportion of their business 
devoted to "big-ticket" durable items, ranging from refrigerators to sofas. 
</P>
<P>
But even apparel stores suffered in some parts of the country where unusually 
mild weather discouraged shopping for heavy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
On a positive note, analysts said consumers probably postponed purchases of 
winter things last month, which should help sales during the crucial Christmas 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The shift that has been taking place in consumer spending patterns -- toward 
apparel and other soft lines such as linens and away from durable goods -- 
should continue into the peak holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Loeb, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said consumers are 
becoming more cautious spenders given the weakness in the economy, particularly 
on the manufacturing side. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers' results are watched closely for clues about consumer spending, which 
accounts for about two-thirds of total U.S. economic output. 
</P>
<P>
Loeb said sales of men's wear, furs and automobiles are among the categories 
performing poorly. He said those categories are early indicators of the 
national spending mood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a slowdown in consumer spending in the Christmas season," Loeb 
said, noting that retail sales gains will be "meager." 
</P>
<P>
Store owners might have to slash prices to entice reluctant consumers -- which 
would be good news for shoppers hunting for bargains on gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for a very promotional Christmas," said Loeb. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, sales gains in November and December likely will not look great 
because the tallies will be compared to last year's robust sales. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's results varied widely among the types of retailers, and for this 
reason analysts said it was difficult to generalize. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said general 
merchandise sales rose an average of 4.3% in October for stores open at least a 
year, compared to September's 5.9% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, the largest U.S. retailer, said its sales edged up 0.7% in the four 
weeks ended Oct. 28, but sales at Sears stores open at least a year, called 
same-store or comparable-store sales, were flat. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better measure of a 
company's performance than tallies that include newly opened stores. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears Merchandise Group, said 
revenue has been hurt by a decline in demand for durables and by the shift in 
the company's pricing and merchandising strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The shift to "everyday low prices" that began in March and the discontinuation 
of major sales promotions, such as super Saturdays, has made comparisons 
between sales this year and last year difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said at a meeting with financial analysts in New York that Sears is in 
good shape for Christmas. Inventories are in line to meet expected demand.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOME NURSING FIRMS TACKLE AIDS CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, David Kessler, a registered nurse, tried to interest the home 
health-care companies for which he was working to establish a special group of 
nurses devoted to helping patients with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
When his supervisors scoffed at the idea, he founded his own company, 
Progressive Nursing Services in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I created this company from a nurse's viewpoint," said Kessler, who treated 
his first AIDS patient in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive Nursing is one of a handful of Southern California small businesses 
dedicated to treating AIDS patients at home. Together, the companies are 
providing care for many of the 7,993 AIDS patients in Los Angeles County and 
hundreds more in adjacent areas. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives say their greatest challenges are finding competent, 
compassionate nurses to meet the demand and pressing the state and private 
insurance companies to reimburse them in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
Their businesses are thriving for two reasons. The primary one is that most 
AIDS patients prefer to remain at home with friends and relatives if at all 
possible. Staying home also makes financial sense. A week in the hospital for a 
seriously ill AIDS patient can cost up to $15,000, compared to $700 to $800 a 
week if visiting nurses can provide the same care at home. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of home nursing firms has been fueled by new technologies and 
portable medical equipment. Treatments once limited to hospital settings, such 
as intravenous antibiotics and liquid nutrition, can now be administered safely 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Companies providing home care for AIDS patients and those considering a move 
into the field recently received an incentive from the state of California. 
Starting this month, California's medical insurance program, Medi-Cal, will pay 
for certain home health-care services for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"The state will pay for attendants, nurses and some housing renovation costs 
for things such as wheelchair ramps and grab bars," said Rob Peterson, program 
manager for the AIDS Project L.A.'s community health pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are limits on the coverage, but it is an important first step 
toward better home care for Medi-Cal patients with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson is familiar with local health-care companies because he is supervising 
a three-year, state-sponsored study comparing the cost of home care to hospital 
care for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always room for more companies to treat AIDS patients," said 
Peterson. "I wish there were more nurses, too. The ones who are doing it are 
very dedicated and thorough, but the burnout rate is quite high." 
</P>
<P>
Founders of the companies treating AIDS patients at home said they started 
their own businesses because they were unhappy with the way their employers 
were doing the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Our founders were nurses who worked for another company," said Renee 
Ryan-Johnson, director of nursing for Comprehensive Nursing Services in Los 
Angeles. "They were quite dissatisfied and unhappy with the service given to 
AIDS patients." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan-Johnson said companies providing AIDS care are different than most nursing 
registries because they must be very involved in managing insurance benefits 
and acting as a patient advocate. She said most insurance policies are "just 
not suited to the kind of care AIDS patients need." By working closely with 
insurance providers, Ryan-Johnson said comprehensive has "conserved a lot of 
insurance dollars for patients wanting to be treated at home." 
</P>
<P>
Integrated Care Systems opened in March, 1988, and has seven offices around the 
state. About half of its patients have AIDS, according to Bruce Borggreve, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at ourselves as a complete care company," said Borggreve. "We provide 
a composite of services surrounding the IV (intravenous) patient." 
</P>
<P>
Integrated Care Systems, with its 175 employees around the state, is a 
subsidiary of a publicly held health-care company in Boston. Borggreve, who 
formerly worked for American Hospital Supply Co. and Caremark, said his 
greatest challenges are recruiting good staff members and dealing with 
Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"An inexperienced company should approach it cautiously if they are trying to 
build a new business around AIDS," said Borggreve. "You've got to be here 
tomorrow to continue the service." 
</P>
<P>
David Kessler, the former actor now considered a pioneer in AIDS care, said he 
thought AIDS would be a short-lived malady like Legionnaire's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the need for the specialized care Progressive Nursing provides has 
soared and Kessler finds himself at the helm of a company that has doubled in 
size in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hard for me to deal with the business side," admits Kessler, who 
hired a business manager early on to help him with the nuts and bolts of 
running a company. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has learned to delegate more and more responsibility to his 
22 staff members. And he has joined a group of top executives who meet 
regularly to discuss common problems. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he expects sales to exceed $3 million. He said he is talking with 
hospital executives who are interested in setting up a joint venture with 
Progressive to treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I never set out to start a business," he said. "It really kind of happened out 
of the blue." 
</P>

COMPUTERS: THE FIRM'S PREDICTION FOR THE 4TH QUARTER IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES 
OF ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT UPSET WALL STREET.

Compaq Computer Corp., which has enjoyed years of stellar growth, became the 
latest victim of the computer industry's woes Thursday when it announced that 
fourth-quarter earnings will be less than a year ago due to a slowdown in U.S. 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
The news represents the first time in five years that the personal computer 
maker's quarterly profits have failed to exceed those of the prior year's 
period. Last year the Houston-based company posted profits of $91.9 million on 
sales of $667.6 million in the final three months, and analysts had generally 
been estimating that this year's fourth-quarter earnings would top $105 
million. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the wake of Thursday's announcements, analysts lowered their 
projections to between $62 million and $80 million for the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq's disclosures sent its stock tumbling more than 15%, dropping $16.875 to 
close at $89.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively 
traded issue. Other technology stocks, including International Business 
Machines, Apple Computer, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, also fell, as fears 
that the forces behind Compaq's problems would affect a wider range of 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was the second in two weeks from Compaq to stun Wall Street 
and send its stock skidding. Last week the company posted disappointing 
third-quarter profits and revealed that a flaw in the microprocessor for its 
top-of-the-line personal computer would probably delay shipments. In the last 
two weeks, Compaq's stock has dropped $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an amazing fall from grace," said Peter Rogers, a technology analyst 
at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage. "As far as Wall 
Street is concerned, the bloom is off the rose." 
</P>
<P>
Although the industrywide sales slowdown has affected a wide range of computer 
makers throughout most of the last year, Compaq had seemed immune from the 
problems to many analysts. The tightly managed and sharply focused company has 
traditionally made the hottest-selling products in today's market: high-powered 
desktop models and portables. 
</P>
<P>
However, in its announcement Thursday, the company said sales last month were 
10% below its expectations, with no sign of immediate improvement for the 
remainder of the year. Still, the company said it expects the problems to be 
resolved by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fourth-quarter issue and when that's over, these problems should be 
gone," said Michael Swavely, president of Compaq North America. 
</P>
<P>
Swavely listed three primary causes of the company's current problems: slower 
growth of personal computer sales in the United States; the current transition 
in Compaq's product line, and uncertainity about the availability of Intel's 
486 microprocessor needed for Compaq's new top-of-the-line PC scheduled for 
unveiling Monday. Intel acknowledged last week that two design flaws will delay 
volume production of the chip until late this month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Swavely acknowledged that aggressive price cutting by IBM on 
certain PC models has cut into the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scoreboard, a Dallas market research firm, IBM has moved ahead of 
Compaq in sales of high-powered desktop machines containing the Intel 386 
microprocessor. IBM's share of this market, which Compaq has dominated for the 
last year, climbed to 38% in the third quarter, compared to 35% for Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive competition among PC makers has been sparked in large part by 
the falling rate of sales growth in the United States. According to Scoreboard, 
sales growth in the first three months of 1989 was 26% above that of the prior 
year's quarter. In the second quarter, the rate was 11% higher, but in the 
third quarter it was just 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, nothing has changed for Compaq," said Richard Shaffer, 
editor of an industry newsletter. "The technology still favors the type of 
machine that Compaq produces. But this news just shows that the slowdown has 
finally caught up with Compaq, and that even the strongest companies in the 
industry aren't immune."

Eastman Kodak Co.: The Rochester, N.Y. photographic, chemicals and plastics 
firm, which also owns Sterling Drug Inc., reported that third-quarter net 
income dropped 25% from a year ago to $329 million. Sales totaled a record 
$5.11 billion, up 2%. The results were attributed to higher operating costs and 
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rate changes.

Coastal Corp.: The Houston diversified energy company said third-quarter 
earnings totaled $3 million, down 67% from the 1988 period. Revenue rose 5% to 
$1.9 billion. The firm said the results reflected a $6.5-million operating loss 
for its trucking segment and an $8.4-million increase in interest and debt 
expense "largely due to our emphasis on capital expansion and other investments 
that will contribute to future profits."

FLASH! THAT'S HOW FAST THE LAST HERALD WENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Adolph Botello, Thursday's newspaper run should have been just another trip 
to the coin box: Drop in a quarter, grab the paper, go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it became a protracted hunt for the city's latest treasure -- the last 
edition of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been driving up and down the streets, trying to find a copy of the 
newspaper," said Botello, sliding the last four copies out of a coin box across 
the street from the newspaper's nearly deserted office building. "The racks 
were all empty. There aren't many left." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, almost as soon as copies of the elusive edition hit the streets 
Thursday morning, souvenir seekers from Los Angeles and Orange counties were 
snatching up stacks of the papers from local newsstands and coin boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 copies were sold before noon, said Bob Martin, circulation 
manager for the Herald Examiner. In some parts of Los Angeles, readers and 
vendors said, racks had been emptied as early as 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said today's newsstand sales total was the fourth-largest for a single 
day in the history of the paper. The coveted edition is expected to sell more 
than any other copy of the paper in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sold everything we've put out," said Martin, whose paper announced 
Wednesday that it would publish its final edition Thursday. "People have been 
calling us all day looking for a paper. Our dealers and newsstands are calling 
us because they sold out as well. People expect this to be a collector's item." 
</P>
<P>
Newsstand vendors said they were happily stunned by the skyrocketing sales of 
the final edition. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually sell about 40 or 50 a day," said Nirmal Singh, a vendor in 
Westwood. "We sold 200 today, but we could have used 500." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sudden sales increase, Singh said, his business would suffer 
slightly in the long run from the closure of the Herald Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good paper and people would buy it," he said. "We're going to lose 
money. Of course, we're going to stay in business, but it'll still be a loss." 
</P>
<P>
Some readers were aggravated by the scarcity of the last edition. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the Herald Examiner? Don't you have the Herald Examiner? Doesn't 
anybody have a Herald Examiner?" growled Robbie Hubbard at two vendors in front 
of a Wilshire Boulevard newsstand. "This is the second place I've gone, and 
nobody has a copy. I can't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
While buyers like Hubbard scrambled to find just one copy, others hoarded and 
hawked stacks of the papers as fast -- and for as much -- as they could. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kid on Fraternity Row flagged down the Herald truck when it got here this 
morning and bought six bundles" of 50 papers each, said Gary Pine, a sports 
information official at USC. "The last we heard, he'd sold three bundles -- at 
$20 a copy." 
</P>
<P>
One veteran newspaper collector questioned whether the edition was worth such a 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to collect papers for world events," said Rick Brown, founder of 
the Newspaper Collectors Society of America. "Papers with headlines and stories 
about the (recent Bay Area) earthquake will be worth a lot. A newspaper's 
folding may have an impact on the community, but it's not a world event. The 
last edition probably won't be worth much." 
</P>
<P>
But many readers said they cared little for profit margins. They said they 
planned to hold on to their copies in remembrance of the paper that was once 
America's largest afternoon daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss the Herald," said Valerie Doby, 28, an accountant at 
Transamerica Insurance Co. "I've been downtown for 10 years and they have 
always been there for me. All we can do is keep (the employees of the daily) in 
our prayers."

'LIFE GOES ON' FOR SUDDENLY JOBLESS WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: HERALD STAFFERS ARE ALREADY PICKING UP THE PIECES AND GETTING ON 
WITH THEIR CAREERS. FOR MOST, THIS MEANS STARTING A JOB SEARCH.

Herald Examiner account executive Kevin Mallett wasted little time. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning found the 30-year-old newspaper executive filling out a job 
application at a competing paper the day after the Herald announced it would 
close forever. 
</P>
<P>
"Life goes on," said Mallett, who had been with the Herald seven months. "I 
have a wife, two kids and a mortgage. You have to lick your wounds. Then you've 
just got to get up and get going." 
</P>
<P>
After an evening of emotional get-togethers at local bars and restaurants, many 
of the Herald's roughly 750 employees had already taken some steps Thursday to 
find new jobs and begin new lives. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a trio of Los Angeles investors whose bid for the Herald Examiner 
was rejected Thursday said they will make a new offer that includes more cash, 
according to United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard R. Hopkins told the news service that the investment group, 
which includes entrepreneur Peter A. O'Neil and former Herald controller John 
Reid, wanted to convert the paper to a tabloid, rename it the Los Angeles Post 
and rehire most of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
The offer apparently had no impact on plans to shut down the Herald for good. 
The Herald's owner, Hearst Corp., said employees will continue to receive 
paychecks and health benefits for the next 60 days, and a firm will be hired to 
help employees find news jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Employees dropped by the Herald's downtown Los Angeles office Thursday to 
collect their belongings, visit with colleagues, gather job tips and pick up 
plans for a wake this Sunday evening at the Los Angeles Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
But many were still shaking their heads in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been sort of numb since all of this started," said David Limrite, 31, 
feature section art director. "I haven't had time to deal with it. The first 
day I don't walk in here will be when it really hits." 
</P>
<P>
If some employees weren't ready to start looking for jobs, several companies 
had already launched recruitment efforts aimed at Herald workers. Reporters and 
editors said newspapers from across the nation had begun calling up prospects, 
and faxed job notices had been posted on bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters from the Orange County Register occupied a room in a downtown hotel 
to interview applicants, and other newspapers were reportedly flying in their 
headhunters. The Times has already hired a few Herald staff writers, who began 
work immediately. 
</P>
<P>
On the sidewalks around the Herald's offices, officials from financial and 
insurance firms were handing out flyers. "I came down here to get the last 
issue, and while I was here I thought I might as well headhunt," said Dick 
Compton, an insurance and financial sales executive. 
</P>
<P>
Several Herald employees said they believed that the paper's demise was 
inevitable and had begun searching for new jobs long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the process of interviewing for another job," said entertainment 
listing editor Barak Zimmerman. "If anybody didn't see it coming, they were 
playing ostrich." 
</P>
<P>
But many Herald employees were in no rush to find jobs -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be tight for a while," said television and film writer Nancy Randle, 
but "it's been five intense years and I need a little breathing space."

FOR SPRING, IT'S FABRIC COMBINATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK DESIGNERS DISPLAY SUBTLE BUT CLEAR CHANGES IN THEIR READY-TO-WEAR 
COLLECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As designers continue to show their spring ready-to-wear collections this week, 
the clothes on the runways don't look all that unusual, yet fashion is subtly 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
There were clear indications of it from Oscar de la Renta and Carolyne Roehm in 
their Wednesday shows. 
</P>
<P>
Fabric combinations are what it's all about. Roehm styled strapless evening 
dresses in formal silk crepe, topped with sporty linen pea coats. And others in 
silk chiffon with linen. De la Renta showed dinner suits with silk Charmeuse 
blouses, with more casual, light wool jackets and sweater knit skirts. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, he didn't skimp on the ball gowns. This time, they had enormous soft 
skirts in palest pink or peach taffeta and beaded, pastel tapestry jackets. 
Roehm's formal wear featured gold lace sheaths with sheer gold tulle wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Most other collections have played with fabric mixes as well. 
</P>
<P>
Ronaldus Shamask, a young, spirited designer, tossed dressy washed-silk blazers 
over industrial-strength khaki pants. He showed elongated washed-silk jackets 
over leggings cropped at mid-calf, in colors such as salmon with rose. 
</P>
<P>
There were few mistakes in this collection but the wide-weave fishnet sweaters 
were one. Shown over bare, very visible breasts, they looked too nude. One 
model wrapped her arms across her chest as she walked the runway in playful 
protest. The audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
This was Shamask's last collection for the company that carries his name. He 
and his partner, Murray Moss, split up just before this show. Shamask will 
start his own company soon; Moss is looking for a new designer. Whether Shamask 
must leave his name behind is not yet decided. Technically, Moss owns the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kors, whose clothes are close in spirit to Shamask, mixed big 
seersucker shirts with sequined seersucker pajama pants. He picked up on other 
trends too, showing bra tops over sarong skirts and long, all-fringe skirts 
with longer, shaped, linen jackets. 
</P>
<P>
These cross-over clothes, in a mix of evening, daytime and active-wear fabrics, 
come across like tamed versions of the wild and wacky combinations of 
Paris-based Christian Lacroix, whose couture collections have been a powerful 
influence on all of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix was showing evening gowns in pony skin and taffeta and suits in 
tapestry with tartan plaid when most designers were still showing mostly black. 
Now, the practical, mass-market-minded Americans are translating Lacroix into 
English. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the only trend in town. Adrienne Vittadini's collection featured 
several others. She showed long over short, a leading trend for spring. Her red 
plaid jackets are so long, in fact, that they all but cover the matching shorts 
underneath. It's a provocative look. At first glance, it seems there is nothing 
beneath the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Henderson, a promising newcomer, showed long jackets over miniskirts. 
And in his tribute to the Southwest, Ralph Lauren put serape jackets over short 
skirts made of white cotton petticoat fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Lauren traveled to his own drum. His best works were his 
admiral-stripe pants suits, coat dresses and evening sheaths. He showed them in 
ivory and navy blue, with brass buttons and gold braid on the sleeves or 
collars. The sparely shaped sheathes had gold braid halter straps. 
</P>
<P>
His '30s golf ensembles -- linen plus fours, argyle sweater vests and foulard 
bow ties -- missed the mark as street wear. Too costume-y. But since golf has 
emerged as the unlikely preferred sport among Century City lawyers and Sunset 
Strip rock 'n' rollers alike, there may be a place in Los Angeles for the 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
For summer '90, almost every designer here has switched from black to white as 
the color of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Shamask showed skimpy, backless ivory evening dresses with slim strings holding 
them in place at the neckline. Lauren showed wide-leg trousers and jackets, 
silk pants suits and Southwestern petticoat dresses in white. 
</P>
<P>
Pants have all but replaced skirts in most collections, and pant suits are the 
leading look for working women. Long skirts never looked more out of place. 
Lauren shows mid-calf or longer skirts and dresses as he did for fall and 
winter. But so far, he is the only big name designer to do so.

A MAINE VERSION OF 'TOBACCO ROAD'

<TEXT>
<P>
Once Upon a Time on the Banks by Cathie Pelletier (Viking: $19.95; 369 pages) 
</P>
<P>
This is a novel about lowlife in upstate Maine, set in the same benighted town 
that provided the bleak venue for Pelletier's first book, "The Funeral Makers." 
Forget Winslow Homer, Kennebunkport, L. L. Bean, blueberries and lobster rolls. 
There's nothing here you'd want to hang over the sofa, visit, order by mail or 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
If you went to Mattagash, you'd be staying in the Albert Pinkham Motel, a 
four-cabin establishment where guests must rent a radio from the proprietor. 
You'd dine at Henri Nadeau's Quick Lunch and Gas Station, and while you were 
filling up, chances are the Gifford brothers would strip your car of everything 
but the paint job. By the time you got to Mattagash, their work would be half 
undone by the pot holes and frost heaves in the road, deep and high enough to 
loosen even welded parts. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason to go to Mattagash would be an invitation to Amy Joy Lawler's 
wedding, the social event of the season, heralded by a photo in the Watertown 
Weekly of Amy Joy and her betrothed, Jean-Claude Cloutier, posed against the 
refrigerator in someone's kitchen. Though Amy Joy's family has come down in the 
world since her missionary grandfather perished in China and her schoolteacher 
father committed suicide, her mother, Sicily Lawler, is so horrified at the 
thought of her daughter marrying a person of French-Canadian background that 
all her internal organs rebel simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Even to a disinterested outsider, Jean-Claude hardly seems a prize. He works as 
a grease monkey, has a low tolerance for alcohol and considerable difficulty 
with the English language. Then again, since Amy Joy isn't exactly the deb of 
the year either, the reader may not quite see what all the fuss is about. 
Still, this is 1969, and the Catholic-Protestant tension in northern Maine is 
as acute, if not as bloody, as in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding, planned for three weeks after the beginning of the novel, affords 
us the opportunity to meet the invited guests as well as those residents of 
Mattagash, population 456, who will probably show up anyway. Coming all the way 
from Portland will be the Ivy family, owners of the imposing Ivy Funeral Home, 
where the deceased are known as "house guests," and the founder's son reminds 
his employees to think of themselves as "hosts." "We are not a parlor," he 
tells his staff, "because we don't give massages." 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Ivy's wife, Thelma, is Sicily Lawler's sister, so the Ivys must tear 
themselves away from the sophistication of Portland to attend the rural 
nuptials, a prospect that contributes significantly to the plot, providing the 
chance to know Thelma, hooked on Valium; Randy Ivy, the heir apparent, who 
prefers non-prescription chemicals; and make the acquaintance of the luscious 
Monique Tessier, a secretary at the funeral home and Marvin Ivy's mistress. 
</P>
<P>
We see and hear a lot about the feudin' and fightin' Gifford family, who have 
turned their stretch of Mattagash into a Down East and less sexy version of 
Tobacco Road; follow the diminishing fortunes of Albert Pinkham, the 
motel-keeper; and watch in helpless horror as Jean-Claude, the 
bridegroom-elect, disgraces himself. When an Ivy family disaster upstages, 
preempts and ultimately obviates the imminent wedding, we rejoice right along 
with Sicily Lawler. 
</P>
<P>
Herself a one-time resident of northern Maine, the author obviously knows and 
may once have loved the quirky setting of the novel. She can be lyrical when 
describing the coming of spring, when you hear "the ancient sound of water 
dripping from eaves, of car tires finally touching tarred roads, of rips 
rattling again in the Mattagash River," and the whole town is pervaded by the 
smell of Pike Gifford's stack of stolen automobile tires thawing out in the 
warm sun. Now that Pelletier has moved away to Tennessee, there's a lot more 
knowing than loving in this municipal portrait of the town and its denizens; a 
grand place for a writer to be from, and terrific people to remember from a 
distance of 2,000 miles and 20 years.

STOP DA MUSIC! IS THIS THE REAL DURANTE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
"Let's do a musical about Jimmy Durante." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah -- but who could we get to play him?" 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, that's not the reason "Durante" is a bust at the Shubert Theatre. 
Lonny Price plays the Schnozzola, and he's pretty good, once you get over being 
offended by the very notion of someone being allowed to imitate the great 
Durante. Is nothing sacred? No, but that's not Price's fault. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Blum and Evan Pappas aren't bad, either, as Jimmy's old partners Lou 
Clayton and Eddie Jackson. When the three pals are doing the old 
strutaway-in-their-cutaways, we may not literally see Clayton, Jackson and 
Durante, but we get the sense of what they offered audiences of their time. 
Hot-cha! 
</P>
<P>
As a retrospective of Jimmy Durante routines then, the show has some 
entertainment value. We purists might not see the point of it -- why not watch 
Jimmy himself on videotape? -- but there's no law against it. An hour of 
"Durante" would make a nice cabaret show, especially if the cabaret was decked 
out like the speakeasies where Clayton, Jackson and Durante used to play. 
</P>
<P>
A full-length Broadway musical, "Durante" is not. "We gotta come up with some 
sort of story here," it keeps saying in effect. But it can't find one. The 
notion of "story" implies the notion of trouble, and Jimmy never got into any. 
</P>
<P>
He did, it seems, rather neglect his first wife, Jeanne, for his pals. She died 
in the early 1940s, and some people suspect that she was the "Mrs. Calabash" to 
whom he used to say good night on TV -- a notion that librettists Frank 
Peppiatt and John Aylesworth could have done something with, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
They do see that there's some drama to be found in Jimmy's insistance that 
Jeanne stay home rather than the join the act. (She was a singer, and actress 
Jane Johanson suggests she was a good one.) But the show bends over backward to 
avoid the suggestion that there was any meanness, sexism or jealousy in Jimmy 
-- it was all Lou Clayton's fault, really. Jimmy was just too loyal to him. 
</P>
<P>
These scenes work so hard to be tactful that they avoid any chance to be 
dramatic. Yet they don't make us think well of Jimmy or his wife. He comes off 
like a wimp, and she comes off like a crybaby who won't speak up. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Johanson does present Jeanne's case to the audience in a soulful ballad 
that contains a line which would have immediately qualified the real Jeanne for 
a place in Jimmy's act: "I want him to be the most possible man he is capable 
of." Absotively! 
</P>
<P>
Forget "Durante" as a story then -- a piece of advice the show's creators might 
well take to heart, if this is the best they can do. Maybe what the show really 
wants to be is "Sugar Babies." It has the same director, Ernest O. Flatt, and 
the same razzmatazz milieu -- lots of gals, trumpets, plinking pianos, flyaway 
scenery and cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
And comedy, some of it the real stuff from the Durante vaults, some of it 
imitation. Standing in the middle of it, Price never touches Jimmy's sublimity, 
but it's a decent and respectful impression, with plenty of energy and a 
certain sensitivity, too. 
</P>
<P>
He's particularly interesting when Jimmy is young and just starting out. We 
think of Durante as the quintessential old salt, but he was once a raw kid with 
a big nose, and Price is able to touch a bit on the pain that went with that. 
There is a play in Jimmy Durante, but this one isn't it. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays at 2020 Avenue of the Stars, Century City. Closes Nov. 19. Performances 
Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays at 2 p.m. and Sundays at 3 
p.m. Tickets $20-$45; (800) 233-3123.

Snyder on KWNK: Tom Snyder is back on the Los Angeles air waves, heard nightly 
from 7 to 10 on KWNK-AM (670), a San Fernando Valley-based talk station. 
Snyder's nationally syndicated radio show was dropped by KABC-AM last spring 
because of excessive pre-emptions during the baseball season. KWNK is also 
starting a new magazine-format news and entertainment morning show that will 
feature Dick McInnes from 6 to 9 a.m., replacing Randy Kerdoon who went to 
KFWB. McInnes, who got his start working for Rona Barrett and co-authored the 
autobiography of Dorothy Lamour, also interviews soap opera stars Saturdays 
from 12 to 1 p.m. on a KWNK show called "S.O.A.P." ALEENE MacMINN

Almost Banned in Boston: A practitioner of shock art, who lit fireworks on his 
chest during an appearance in Boston, has touched off a swirl of comments on 
how much is too much in this genre. Joe Coleman, appearing before a small 
audience at the Boston Film and Video Foundation, bit off the head and front 
legs of a white mouse and hugged one spectator after he poured a bucket of 
blood over himself. When he ignited fireworks on his chest, some burning shards 
landed in the audience, endangering spectators. Fire officials said they would 
press for charges. Patrons, animal-rights activists and some arts leaders all 
said Coleman went too far. ALEENE MacMINN

Coming Attractions: Producer David Wolper, the force behind TV epics such as 
"Roots" and "The Thorn Birds," is developing a movie about the Northern 
California earthquake for ABC. Wolper is in the early stages of research and 
will focus on acts of heroism connected with the devastating temblor. CBS and 
NBC said they have no plans to produce movies based on the Oct. 17 tragedy. . . 
. The Universal Pictures comedy "Uncle Buck," which has grossed $61 million so 
far, is headed for life as a CBS sitcom. Writer-producer Tim O'Connell is 
developing the project. ALEENE MacMINN

Cassini Starts Talking: Fashion master Oleg Cassini makes his debut as a 
talk-show host Sunday at 2 p.m. on Arts &amp; Entertainment cable, but the 
venture doesn't mean he has designs on a whole new career. "My philosophy is, 
if it's there, why not try it," Cassini said in a telephone interview from his 
office in New York. On "Conversation with Cassini," he talks informally "with 
people I know well, at my house or their house, so their personalities come 
though." Bob Hope is on the first program. ALEENE MacMINN

BENITEZ DANCERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Flaring nostrils, creased brows and heel-stamping drama may be enough for other 
Spanish dancers -- not Maria Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
When she and her chamber-sized company began a three-night stint Wednesday at 
the Japan America Theatre, they banished any notions of cliche. To be sure 
their show had the de rigueur intensity and allure -- a cantaor cried his song 
of anguish, two guitarists strummed a mighty roar and the dancers boasted 
commanding personalities. 
</P>
<P>
But none of what they did was 2-dimensional. For the art of the dance as 
defined by Benitez involves utmost subtlety -- the kind that comes from the 
full employment of the body, not just authoritative carriage, picturesque 
profiles and rhythmic vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Her hands, for instance, do not simply punctuate the air overhead, they swivel 
from the wrist in stunning, voluptuous rotations. Nor are any movements 
isolated; instead there is a fluid ever-evolving line. And her locomotion is so 
smooth that she seems to glide cross-stage while executing heel-work of 
incremental variety. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benitez's company falls into a traditional category, her dances are 
somewhat stylized. Low lights and dim spots on the four women and one man 
projected a mysteriously somber opening scene. During a solo the others become 
a ghostly chorus. In the final number, a flamenco suite, she abandons feminine 
dress in favor of high-waisted black pants. 
</P>
<P>
A zarzuela excerpt (taped music by Albeniz) rounded out a program high in 
virtuosity. DONNA PERLMUTTER

GEORGIAN STATE DANCERS OPEN AT SAN DIEGO FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What comes to mind when you think of Russian folk dancing? Ballet and 
Broadway's strapping fellows in tunics and boots, arms folded across their 
chests, doing squat-kicks and knocking back the vodka? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's Innocent Ivan and his two brothers at Aurora's Wedding in Marius 
Petipa's choreography for "The Sleeping Beauty," or the cossacks at the local 
tavern in Jerome Robbins' "Fiddler on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
Well, that kind of saltation pales next to the leaping, sword play and male 
pointe dancing (without block shoes, no less) of the Georgian State National 
Singing and Dancing Ensemble, which opened at the Spreckels Theatre on 
Wednesday for a five-day run as the key dance entry in San Diego's 
predominately Georgian and Russian "Treasures of the Soviet Union" arts 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
Yet astounding as the feats of these Georgians were, much of the program was 
spent on unremarkable group formation dancing that downplayed the male dancers' 
abilities and used the women only as decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Like Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, their Georgia is a place where all the 
men are strong, all the women are beautiful and all the children (if there were 
any) would be above average. Stone Age patriarchy rules the roost, with the men 
cavorting and battling one another, while the women skirr silently and 
expressionlessly across the floor, demurely lowering their eyes in the presence 
of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that's all the 10 women of the troupe ever do. And while their gliding 
is ornate, propelled by itty-bitty steps hidden by floor-length gowns, it can't 
compete with the flashy male athletics. The women are primarily accessories for 
the men and even in the pair dances, the women and men don't touch each other. 
</P>
<P>
When the men take the floor alone, however, they forbid inattention, bounding 
in from the wings, twisting, turning, diving to their knees and whipping around 
on the ground like dervishes. 
</P>
<P>
In the show's opener, the "Khandjluri," the warriors threw daggers into the 
stage floor and danced around them. Later, in a Highland saber-and-shield dance 
called the "Paricaoba," sparks flew as pairs of dancers combined pirouettes 
with sword fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the finale, "Mkheduli," did we really see what the men could do. Leaps, 
pointe dancing, turns and staccato movements were combined to suggest 
cavalrymen and horses in battle. 
</P>
<P>
The well-rehearsed 16-member choir, conducted by artistic director Jemal 
Chkuaseli, sung several a cappella hymns and labor songs ranging from dirgelike 
to spritely and dating back as far as the 10th Century. Rich and robust tones 
came forth from faces that were often beguilingly melodramatic. 
</P>
<P>
A standing ovation encouraged several of the leading male dancers to fly into 
the air, whir and prance on pointe with even more vivacity than before. JAN

DENTIST MAKES A BID FOR FAME WITH HOLLYWOOD MEMORABILIA; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: GEORGE REEVES' 'SUPERMAN' SUIT AND A PAIR OF MUNCHKIN SHOES FROM 
'WIZARD OF OZ' WILL BE AMONG 840 ITEMS OFFERED IN THE BIGGEST HOLLYWOOD AUCTION 
IN NEARLY 20 YEARS.

Barry Vilkin, a dentist who specializes in root canals, purchased his first 
movie poster 18 months ago. This weekend, his auction company, Camden House 
Auctioneers, is conducting the largest movie memorabilia auction since the MGM 
sale nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday and Sunday at the Ebell Club in Los Angeles, Vilkin will take bids 
for 840 items, ranging from George Reeves' "Superman" costume from the '50s TV 
series with an estimated price tag of $50,000, to a rare pair of Munchkin shoes 
worn in 1939's "The Wizard of Oz," valued at a more modest $3,500. What's 
unusual about the auction is that every item that goes up on the block is 
genuine Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer in specialization," the 34-year-old Vilkin said, who still 
maintains his dental practice three days a week. "In the medical field, I 
specialize. I saw the same need in movie memorabilia. It bothered me that 
auction houses across the country were throwing movie memorabilia in with other 
collectibles, like dolls, toys and plates." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Vilkin was collecting California fine art. When the prices 
soared too high for his pocketbook, he began searching for an alternative art 
form to collect. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved movies, so I started collecting movie posters," he said. "Almost 
immediately, I began meeting people who collected posters and other 
memorabilia, and I kind of detected this undercurrent of energy that seemed to 
be building. I found out about different trade publications devoted to people 
who collect movie memorabilia. You open them up and there's thousands of ads in 
there of people buying and selling." 
</P>
<P>
Sensing that he had stumbled upon a hot market, Vilkin took a week off from his 
dental practice and went to California Auctioneers School in Los Angeles to 
learn about the business and obtain an auctioneer's license. Next, he took out 
ads in trade and movie magazines asking people for movie memorabilia to sell in 
an upcoming auction. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, I ran the ads to see if anyone would call," Vilkin said. "I didn't 
even know if the phone was going to ring. But in the first week it rang about 
50 times. The next week, it rang probably 200 times. Then the word of mouth 
started, and pretty soon I couldn't keep up with the people who were contacting 
me." 
</P>
<P>
This is Vilkin's second auction. His first was in May with 550 lots. 'Barry is 
becoming extremely popular," said Michael Shaw, a former MGM childhood actor 
whose memorabilia collection includes one of the five pair of ruby slippers 
from "Wizard of Oz." "He's being taken seriously by collectors. What he is 
doing right now is establishing credibility and building a reputation in the 
world of Hollywood memorabilia, which is becoming bigger all the time." 
</P>
<P>
It was in the early '80s that lost and forgotten Hollywood bric-a-brac began 
surfacing in public auctions, after being sold and traded privately for years. 
The Hollywood artifacts were culled largely by collectors who salvaged them 
from studio dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for financial windfall was first realized in 1982, when Steven 
Spielberg paid $61,000 at a Sotheby's auction in New York for one of the 
Rosebud sleds from "Citizen Kane." But the floodgates opened wide in June, 
1988, when a pair of ruby slippers was auctioned off by Christie's New York for 
$165,000. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Sotheby's sold one of the two pianos from "Casablanca" for 
$154,000; a 1938 radio script from Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" for 
$143,000; and a black-and-white animation cel from the early Walt Disney 
cartoon "The Orphan's Benefit" for $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little afraid of the market right now," said Beverly Hills dentist Gary 
Milan, the seller of the "Casablanca" piano. Milan still owns a second piano 
from the film, as well as the leaden statuette from "The Maltese Falcon," which 
he claims is worth more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to buy, not to sell," Milan said. "The economy is pretty flat 
right now. I think when there's another jump in inflation and people have 
dollars that they don't know what to do with, this stuff is going to take off 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Items Vilkin has up for auction this weekend include the Marx Brothers' 
personal family photo album, with photos from 1876 to 1925 (estimated value: 
$6,000 to $8,000); Leslie Howard's script from "Gone With the Wind" ($8,000 to 
$10,000); what is believed to be the only surviving theater display banner for 
the 1937 release of Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" ($3,000 to 
$5,000); a photo album from the Hal Roach Studio Archives that contains dozens 
of test photos of early screen stars ($2,000 to $3,000); and more than 500 
vintage movie posters and lobby cards dating back to 1910. 
</P>
<P>
"With each auction, more things kind of get finessed out of the woodwork, which 
is great, " Vilkin said. "Because a lot of people who have these items don't 
look at them as historical artifacts. The 'Superman' costume was donated to Cal 
State Fullerton by the director of the television show and held there for 10 
years. They didn't take care of it, and now it's moth-eaten. These items should 
be preserved and shared." 
</P>
<P>
Camden House has scheduled a public exhibition today from noon to 9 p.m. at the 
Ebell. Poster and lobby cards will be auctioned Saturday beginning at noon, 
with the rest of the items going on the block Sunday at noon. 
</P>
<P>
The Ebell Club is at 4400 Wilshire Blvd. Information: (213) 476-1628.

KELLAWAY'S WAY AT LE CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortunately for a local gathering of admirers, Roger Kellaway decided to 
celebrate his 50th birthday Wednesday (with a follow-up Thursday) at Le Cafe in 
Sherman Oaks. It was a double celebration, since his drummer, John Guerin, had 
reached the big Five-0 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kellaway belongs to a rare breed of piano virtuosi who can be said to defy 
classification. He blends the lyricism of a Bill Evans with the energy of McCoy 
Tyner. He may open unaccompanied with a series of chordal speculations, then 
ease unpredictably into some familiar song -- "Just Friends" or "If I Were a 
Bell" -- to which he will bring, at various points, sumptuous harmonic ideas, 
coruscating cascades of two-handed runs and crashing dissonances. 
</P>
<P>
Chasing down more stylistic avenues than a rainbow has hues, he may reach the 
end of the last chorus, then keep going with a series of hard-cooking tags, 
like a letter with a hundred postscripts. At all times he is sensitively 
followed by Guerin and by his longtime bassist Chuck Domanico. 
</P>
<P>
Kellaway's way with the blues was twice demonstrated. The contrast between 
"Blue Monk" and "All Blues" was striking, since the former is your basic, 
melodically jejune blues tune, yet he was able to bring everything to it from 
atonality to deep indigo funk, whereas "All Blues" is an inherently fascinating 
Miles Davis masterpiece on which the trio elaborated, doubling and halving the 
tempo, building the tension while Domanico's ecstatic expression underlined the 
mutual jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
That Kellaway is a gifted composer was illustrated in "Love of My Life," which 
he recorded recently with Yo-Yo Ma. That he works no less compellingly 
unaccompanied was shown in his solo version of the 60-year-old "I'll Never Be 
the Same," to which he brought his personally graceful touch. Here as 
everywhere, he demonstrated that for him improvisation is not only the art of 
creation, but the art of sublimation. Roger Kellaway is an authentic 20th 
Century genius. LEONARD FEATHER

'OUR MICHAEL' FEINSTEIN SERENADES JEWISH HOME RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabaret-singer Michael Feinstein was at the piano Wednesday night crooning the 
romantic Irving Berlin melody "Always." The lights were dim. The audience 
huddled around tables, holding drinks, some wistfully humming along. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a typical scene for Feinstein, the cabaret star who has 
performed at San Francisco's Plush Room and the Algonquin in New York, in 
addition to the Hollywood Bowl, the White House and Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
But this was no regular nightclub. The white-haired members of the 200-plus 
audience -- average age 75 -- sat at big round tables on a linoleum floor 
drinking water out of Styrofoam cups. This was the dining hall at the Jewish 
Home for the Aging's Victory Village residence in Reseda, decorated with 
streamers and signs saying "Welcome Back Michael." 
</P>
<P>
It was here that Feinstein got his start 13 years ago, performing weekly as a 
20-year-old volunteer. He last played there more than eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be back," he said with emotion in an interview after the hourlong 
performance. "It's a life-affirming experience for me, to come back here and 
see these older people so alive and vital." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein admitted that the feeling in the room was different from a cabaret or 
nightclub. "It's rare to get a feeling of unconditional love at a nightclub," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of the private retirement home love "their Michael," especially 
those who remember the skinny kid in sneakers who used to played for them. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's core fan club, three women sitting together during the show, ogled 
him. "You're my Michael," Rose Tammer, 86, called out. "He belongs to all of 
us. We're all his grandmothers," corrected Rae Cohen, also 86. Cohen, who takes 
18 pills a day for a heart condition, said, "It's amazing what Michael can do 
for a person like me." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see? He kissed me," Tammer said. "I tell people he's my boyfriend. I 
wish he would sing to me as his sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
Her wish was granted. While Feinstein sang "Makin' Whoopee," he glanced over at 
the three with an impish grin. They blushed and giggled like schoolgirls. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Shapiro, 82, the third of the die-hard Feinstein fans, glowed. "It's a 
blessing he's able to come back to us," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said it was unique to play to a crowd so familiar with his repertoire 
of tunes from the '20s, '30s and '40s. "They can appreciate the songs more. 
This music sparks strong memories for them; something special and different 
happens when I play it here. 
</P>
<P>
"And I better not make a mistake, because they know all the words," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said that his music is the best way for him to communicate with the 
elderly. "It helps me to feel a strong connection with these people." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein started playing at the home when his family moved to Canoga Park from 
Columbus, Ohio. In Ohio, Feinstein had played at the home where his grandmother 
lived. "Playing in a nursing home became a habit for me," he added. "It was 
great to see people, who were often quiet and withdrawn, come back to life." 
</P>
<P>
When he played at the Jewish Home for the Aging regularly, he would perform for 
not just for the ambulatory patients but for the seriously ill as well. "That 
was the most gratifying for me. People who could barely talk would open their 
mouths and start singing." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Schnell, 85, president of the Victory Village residents, determined to 
have Feinstein return for a concert. Schnell called Feinstein's office at least 
twice a week for almost two years. "When his secretary called to say he could 
play here again, I was overjoyed," said Schnell. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said he won't wait another eight years for his next visit: "I've been 
away for too long."

A TRADITIONAL FRENCH KITCHEN AT MARINA BISTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Let's get the scrambled eggs with caviar," said the tiny cookbook author who 
writes the big huge books. 
</P>
<P>
Touche. We were in the patio of the Marina Bistro, a gentle, dainty, 
old-fashioned French restaurant -- its symbol is a violet orchid -- and the 
tiny cookbook writer was out-ordering me something fierce. 
</P>
<P>
Her "scrambled" eggs, for instance, were technically "blurred" (oeufs 
brouilles), stirred continuously to get a fine-grained texture but cooked over 
water so they stay creamy instead of drying out. In fact, these could have been 
a shade creamier, but they were much better with caviar than the usual chopped 
hard-cooked eggs, and a shrewder appetizer idea than anything I'd thought of. 
</P>
<P>
I liked the idea of snails in red wine, but tiny person plumped for a special 
of snails in puff pastry. They turned out to be -- of course -- plump snails, 
among the tenderest I've ever had, in a simple but impressive sauce of cream 
boiled down a little with garlic and sprinkled with chives. Touche again. 
</P>
<P>
My best suggestion was zucchini soup, just because I happened to know the 
Marina Bistro makes excellent vegetable soups with no cream, nothing but pureed 
vegetable enriched with a bit of butter and a characteristic dose of black 
pepper. This is a kitchen that likes its black pepper. 
</P>
<P>
This is also a very traditional kitchen, with a chef who used to work in Paris 
at Petrus and the Plaza Athenee. Very few of his dishes couldn't have been 
found on any French menu 20 years ago. The only nearly trendy things are 10 
years old: funny-colored peppercorns in one dish, raspberry vinegar in one 
salad, and a bit of the mania for pureed and/or stuffed vegetables. Little 
cylinders of zucchini filled with winter squash puree, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Other parties were having their own fun in the plants and latticework 
environment of the dining patio, laughing and holding hands and that sort of 
stuff, but at our table serious food discussion raged. The cookbook writer 
surprisingly suggested that somebody have jambonnette de volaille au homard, 
which is about the cheapest entree on the menu. This is simply a stuffed boned 
chicken drumstick in a sauce of cream and reduced lobster broth, but it was 
unusually good, the stuffing a light and refreshing hash of chopped leeks 
instead of the usual ground meat. 
</P>
<P>
I had a grilled prime rib, but it was simply bravado on my part to order meat. 
Mostly, I know the fish entrees on this menu: say, a grilled tuna steak with 
beurre rouge, which is a strong reduction of red wine plus butter and plenty of 
black pepper. Fortunately, my prime rib was very good in its strong, 
old-fashioned Cabernet sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, when it came to her own order, the tiny cookbook writer picked 
the bouillabaisse (available only on Fridays and Saturdays). She had just been 
talking about how one of the differences between bouillabaisse and Italian 
cioppino is that the former isn't supposed to include shellfish when the 
bouillabaisse came, in a showy shell-shaped bowl . . . and it was mostly 
shellfish. Furthermore, there was a bitter, iodine taste in the broth, possibly 
the fault of some mussels that seemed past their prime. 
</P>
<P>
Her luck was running out. The chocolate souffle -- not my suggestion -- was the 
kind we expect in this country, slightly overdone and faintly rubbery so the 
waiter can pour chocolate sauce and whipped cream into it, although this is 
hard on its souffle quality. The tiny cookbook writer herself got stuck with a 
creme brulee (which, as she pointed out, the French consider an English dish) 
with a sugar crust that, as she also pointed out, was crystallized but not 
quite caramelized. 
</P>
<P>
I had started feeling an ignorant bystander, but I actually got the best of the 
desserts: a cylindrical pralin tart with caramel frosting and a hidden charge 
of chocolate in the bottom. There is a certain justice in this world; wisdom, 
or even better, the appearance of wisdom, comes to anyone who waits long 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Bistro, 3100 Washington Blvd., Marina del Rey; (213) 822-2020. Open for 
dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Parking lot in rear. All major credit 
cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $48-$73.

FRIENDLY WARNS AGAINST NEWS AS ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Broadcast pioneer Fred W. Friendly warned a crowd of 400 journalism 
professionals and students at the Biltmore Hotel that journalism is "in danger 
of becoming an amusement industry." 
</P>
<P>
Friendly, former president of CBS News, was honored Wednesday night at the USC 
School of Journalism' 30th annual Distinguished Achievement in Journalism 
Awards Dinner. Also honored were Eugene Roberts, executive editor of the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, and syndicated columnist Carl Rowan, who was unable to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly, 74, professor emeritus at the Columbia University Graduate School of 
Journalism, criticized ABC News and programs such as CBS' "Saturday Night With 
Connie Chung" for using dramatic re-enactments to simulate news events. 
</P>

ETHNIC EATING: TRADITIONAL TASTE AT INDIA HOT 'N' FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bidiwala brothers -- Barkat, Siraj and Minas -- opened India Hot 'n' Fast 
Food six months ago. Although it is a clean, spare little place with an 
emphasis on takeout, and although all the food is served in plastic containers, 
Barkat can't restrain himself from waiting on tables. 
</P>
<P>
He is, you see, a former manager of the upscale Gaylord India Restaurant in 
Beverly Hills. Brother Siraj was also a manager. As for Minas -- he was the 
maitre d'. This is hardly your usual fast-food business. 
</P>
<P>
The food is not what you would expect either. Instead of shortcut adaptations, 
it serves full-blown Indian cooking so traditional that two chefs are needed to 
produce it. 
</P>
<P>
Deep Singh, a Punjabi from New Delhi, mans the tandoor oven. He excels with his 
seekh kebab. The finely ground lamb is strongly seasoned with spices, garlic 
and onion, formed into long sausages and plunged on skewers into the tandoor. 
This is one of the best versions in Los Angeles, perfect for anybody who likes 
powerful flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Singh also produces fine chicken tikka. There is an art to cooking these small 
chunks of meat in the tandoor without drying them out, an art that Singh has 
mastered. He knows just when to pull out the skewers. The chicken is marinated 
first with yogurt, cumin, cayenne and the Indian spice blend called garam 
masala. Lemon juice and vinegar add an interesting tang. 
</P>
<P>
His tandoori breads are best eaten at once. Take them home and they'll be limp 
upon arrival. (I revived the garlic naan in a toaster oven and it emerged with 
a new, crisp texture that was quite acceptable.) 
</P>
<P>
Soman Mahalingam, a Tamil from Madras, does the saucy dishes and chutneys. He 
deserves high praise for his chicken makhani -- chicken chunks in a vibrant yet 
mellow sauce of tomatoes, butter, cream and spices. His spicy spinach, saag, is 
wonderful -- aromatic with seasonings but smoothed out with cream. Try it 
combined with chicken saagwala, with lamb (saag gosht) or panir (Indian-style 
cheese). 
</P>
<P>
Karahi chicken and karahi gosht -- stir-fries of chicken and lamb with green 
peppers, onions and tomatoes -- take their name from the karahi, the Indian 
wok. Rogan josh, a lamb curry, was rather oily, but Indians tend to cook with 
generous amounts of oil and ghee. (If you don't like oil, order rogan josh to 
go and let the container stand for a while. The oil will rise to the top and 
you can spoon it off.) 
</P>
<P>
The dish I liked the least was the South Indian dosa, a large pancake made from 
a fermented rice-and-lentil batter. In India, where dosas are as common as corn 
flakes for breakfast, they are usually browned and slightly crisp. This one was 
pale, thick and wet in the center. 
</P>
<P>
There are also sturdy meat and rice briyanis, nice mango lassi to drink and 
several desserts. I liked best a circle of milk fudge called peda that is 
flavored with cardamom and saffron and sprinkled with pistachios. Gulab jamun, 
a fried-milk sweet that looks like doughnut holes in syrup, came decorated with 
glittering flakes of edible silver leaf. Many non-Indians often mistake the 
fragile leaves for aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
If you are among the non-Indian customers, you'll be happy to know that 
photographs of the dishes are mounted on the walls to make ordering easier. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: seekh kebab, $4; chicken saagwala, $3.75; saag panir, 
$2.75; chicken makhani, $3.75, and chicken tikka, $3.50. For $2.20-$2.50 more, 
entrees come with salad, a vegetable, dal, rice and naan. Weekday lunch 
specials include these accompaniments and a main dish for $4.25-$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 India Hot 'n' Fast Food, 10200 Venice Blvd., Culver City; (213) 559-1123 or 
559-1232. Open Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday and 
Sunday from noon to 10 p.m. Shopping center parking. Cash only.

There has been so much attention to conceptual and abstract art in Germany that 
folks forget the consistent strain of Expressionist representational art ebbing 
and flowing right alongside it. A first West Coast show for German 
representational painter Klaus Fussmann introduces us to one painting (sadly, 
not nearly enough) and a handful of smaller gouaches, watercolors and pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Fussmann, a respected teacher and highly regarded painter in Germany, is so 
fresh and unacerbic in small views of California poppies, gardens and meadows 
that we hardly recognize a Nordic hand. His palette is atypically bright, 
unmixed and luminous. He drives colored pigment deep into the pulp with quick, 
controlled strokes so that objects, though thoroughly able to capture the 
physical and affective essence of a scene, are on close inspection no more than 
well-placed abstract marks. (Wenger Gallery 828 N. La Brea Ave., to Nov. 25).

The history of modern art in America includes such signposts as the hard-edged 
work of the American Abstract Artists group in the '30s and the Pollock, 
Rothko, Motherwell generation of the '50s. Italian born abstract artist Giorgio 
Cavallon is firmly planted in both of those artistic crucibles. He immigrated 
to the United States in the '20s, worked with Gorky in the WPA, was a charter 
member of the American Abstract Artists and showed his work in the pivotal 1951 
exhibition of American abstraction at the Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
In this first West Coast exposure to Cavallon, it's difficult to evaluate his 
significance because the abstract idiom he doggedly pursued for more than 40 
years has been mined and hyped to the point of banality. In that context, 
Cavallon can't help but look a little dated and weather worn. 
</P>
<P>
His career shows that as early as the '40s, Cavallon was already using 
landscape and still life as a springboard for watery, expressionistic 
arrangements of color that remotely recall the washy geometries of Diebenkorn. 
His native Venice inspires the bright, light drenched patches of transparent 
color fitted together flatly like a free-form quilt. 
</P>
<P>
One large untitled piece builds a loose abstract infrastructure, covers it over 
with just enough white to let the paint below show through, then slashes a band 
of red and a small counterpoint of yellow across the surface. Few can argue 
with the work's consistency and place in the development of American 
abstraction. (Manny Silverman Gallery, 800 N. La Cienega Blvd., to Nov. 25.)

Kevin Larmon's still-life paintings come complete with a tidy little bowl of 
fruit, but are at heart abstract, conceptualist attacks on the vagueness of 
art. The images, which suggest bird's-eye views of table tops, are flat 
rectangular layerings of washy color or dark varnish that lay like a 
semitransparent tablecloth over Old Master's art reproductions that peek out 
along the edges. 
</P>
<P>
In the center is a small bowl of fruit -- pure shapes occasionally leaning 
toward trompe l'oeil exactness. Spotting the "cloth" are rings from coffee cups 
and paint cans, spills and pencil scribblings that mimic the canvas as 
repository for happenstance and veiled art history. Not surprisingly, this 
painting-on-a-soiled-napkin approach to image-making has a stubborn, subversive 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the points Larmon makes are fresh. He replays some of modernism's 
favorite old tunes about paintings being objects as he balances canvasses on 
blocks of wood or lets them recline on the floor like sloping, truncated desk 
tops. All the posturing seems a little forced and obvious when the point is 
made more simply by the overhead perspective of the image. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Larmon's paintings noteworthy is their solid art historical 
vocabulary. Like the dinner guest whose parody of elaborate table manners mocks 
the cultured refinement of the host, these works play upon historical 
still-life painting to assert how unfulfilling and meaningless painting can be. 
Larmon dishes up innuendo masquerading as mark and makes obscurity the point of 
all the fuss.

Apparently one of the first feminist artists in these parts, Nell Brooker 
Mayhew moved to Los Angeles in 1908, opened an art school and gallery, 
pioneered methods of color etching, lectured extensively and traveled alone by 
car to paint the West Coast's missions, mountains and natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
What comes out of an exhibition of oils and etchings culled from her estate is 
not the discovery of some unsung genius, but it is Mayhew's love of nature and 
her knack for seeing a vital pulse running through all its manifestations. She 
conveyed this by applying paint in nervous pockets and defining views of trees, 
the ocean and mountains in deep blue serpentine outlines. In "Sycamore in 
Mountain Field," a temperamental sky of violet-gray ribbons swirls over 
strident blue peaks and a distant meadow where quick sketch trees look like 
little yellow toadstools. Mayhew is most memorable in paintings of flowers: 
"Zinnias" has an electricity we don't easily forget. (Turner/Dailey, 7220

O.C. REGISTRAR ACTS TO SETTLE POLL GUARD CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney has agreed to pay a $20,000 settlement 
and retrain poll workers nearly a year after six Latino voters filed federal 
suit, contending that they were intimidated during the 1988 general election by 
uniformed guards posted at polling places by the Orange County Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana showed that Tanney, while 
admitting no wrongdoing, will train poll workers to be more sensitive to ethnic 
and racial issues and to bar harassment of voters. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement must be approved by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts. A hearing is set for Nov. 27. And because Tanney was functioning in his 
official capacity, the money will come from taxpayer funds upon approval by the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The revised training instructions outlined in the settlement are already being 
given to the approximately 1,900 people who are preparing to work in the 
county's 957 polling places Tuesday, Assistant Registrar of Voters Rosalyn 
Lever said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a text of the new instructions filed in court records, voter 
officials will now tell trainees, "As precinct officers, you must be sensitive 
to the racial, ethnic and cultural makeup of your precinct voters and the 
vulnerability of some voters to intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
The six individual plaintiffs, joined by several Latino civil rights groups, 
contend that the county and state GOP organizations conspired with Garden Grove 
Republican Curt Pringle to scare away voters by placing 20 guards at 20 
predominantly Latino polling places in Santa Ana during the Nov. 8, 1988, 
election. Pringle narrowly defeated Democrat Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach for 
the 72nd Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting controversy sparked state legislation forbidding armed or 
uniformed guards at polling places. The measure was signed into law by Gov. 
George Deukmejian on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The guards carried signs in Spanish and English, warning that non-citizens 
cannot legally vote. Saddleback Security Services Corp., which provided the 
guards, settled its portion of the lawsuit for $60,000 in July. Among the 
remaining defendants are Pringle, his campaign, the county Republican Party's 
Central Committee and the state Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, David J. Brobeck Jr., said 
that Tanney was not responsible for the actions of the guards, but he agreed to 
settle the case as "a matter of economics," to save the time and expense of a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd done something to intimidate someone or favor the guards or help them 
intimidate people, we wouldn't be settling for so little money," Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney believed, Brobeck continued, that precinct workers were getting adequate 
training, but he agreed to revise the instructions because he wants the poll 
workers "well-trained and prepared for whatever happens out there." 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Finley, one of the attorneys for the six Latino voters and the civil 
rights organizations, said evidence uncovered in the case showed that the 
county registrar of voters had information that there might be "trouble" on 
Election Day and did nothing to alert precinct workers that there might be 
attempts to challenge or intimidate voters. Some workers also aided the guards 
by permitting them to enter voting places with their signs, Finley added. 
</P>
<P>
The new training instructions tell precinct workers that if they see someone 
challenging a voter at the polling place, they should "ask them to leave," and 
if they refuse, the workers should call the registrar of voters office 
immediately. They are also told that no signs except those of the registrar may 
be posted within 100 feet of the polling place. 
</P>
<P>
"Poll watchers have a right to be in your polling place, however they should 
not, in any way, be involved with polling-place operations and they may not 
interfere with your operation of the polling place," the new training material 
says. "They also may not remain if they interfere with or intimidate voters. If 
you believe that the presence or activity of a poll watcher may be intimidating 
voters, please call our office immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said he hopes the new instructions will "sensitize the precinct workers 
to the potential problems" of voters who belong to minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
Of special concern, he said, are recently naturalized citizens who are 
"sensitive to insults" and who have been "subjected to the fears of encounters 
with immigration authorities." Such people are especially vulnerable to a 
tactic such as the posting of uniformed guards at a polling place, Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Fuentes, chairman of the county Republican Party and also a defendant 
in the lawsuit, said the guards were hired because GOP workers had heard a 
rumor that the Democrats might try to bus immigrants in from Mexico to bolster 
Thierbach's position. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said the guards were not hired to intimidate or harass anyone, merely 
to "observe and detect" any illegal voting and report it to the proper 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Finley said the $20,000 will go to the six voters, but they have not yet 
decided how it will be divided or spent.

DANA POINT RESORT PLAN APPEARS DEAD

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bid by the Australian concern Qintex to develop a major seaside resort in 
Dana Point appears to have failed after the financially troubled company said 
Thursday that it would not complete purchase of a key 115-acre tract. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex said in July that it would build a $1-billion resort on the property, 
known as the Headlands, and another nearby tract in the small southern Orange 
County beach town. The two properties are among the last large undeveloped 
sites on Southern California's coast. 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to buy the highly prized property comes in the wake of several 
other setbacks for Qintex, including its recent failure to complete the 
acquisition of the MGM/UA film studios. That $1.5-billion deal fell through 
when Qintex could not complete the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems also appear to be behind the company's decision not to acquire 
the Headlands parcel. A company source said Qintex's Australian lenders refused 
to advance more money for the Dana Point resort project pending a review of the 
company's financial status. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's action disappointed Dana Point officials, who learned about the 
collapse of the land deal from company officials late Thursday. The city, which 
was formed Jan. 1, was anticipating that the project would soon generate 
millions of dollars in tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're watching this with a great deal of interest," said Mayor Eileen Krause, 
who was attending the dedication of Dana Point's new city hall. "It would be 
nice to know what's going to happen. But obviously we will have to deal with a 
change of players." 
</P>
<P>
Qintex agreed earlier this year to buy the Headlands property for $115 million. 
But Qintex took an option on the land that did not require most of the purchase 
price be paid until 1991, by which time the owner was to have obtained 
permission from Dana Point to build on the land. 
</P>
<P>
By missing a $3-million installment payment on the Headlands property, Qintex 
loses its claim on one of the choicest pieces of real estate in Southern 
California. It also loses an additional $12 million it had already paid 
Chandler-Sherman Corp., the owner of the property. Company spokesmen could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex said in a terse release that it would "continue to maintain" ownership 
of the other Dana Point property, at Monarch Beach, on which the purchase was 
completed last summer. The company also said it would continue to operate a 
tennis and golf club there. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials in Los Angeles and in Brisbane, Australia, did not return 
phone calls seeking additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Qintex said earlier that the resort would be hard-pressed to succeed if it 
didn't encompass both properties, which are less than a mile apart, and local 
developers familiar with the project agree. The company had planned to build a 
posh hotel and expensive houses and condominiums, all overlooking the Pacific 
Ocean, on the properties. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the company said it was "far less likely" now that 
Qintex would develop the resort at all. A more likely scenario, he said, was 
that the company would sell the Monarch Beach land to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex paid $132 million for the 232-acre Monarch Beach parcel, acquired from 
Hawaii hotel developer Hemmeter Corp. and local developer Stein-Brief Group. 
</P>
<P>
The two owners had paid only $32 million for the land less than two years 
earlier, fueling speculation that the Australian concern had overpaid and 
didn't understand how costly and time-consuming development in Southern 
California can be. 
</P>
<P>
Stein-Brief and Hemmeter had already spent months getting permission for an 
elaborate 1,100-room resort modeled after Hearst Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex announced that it would probably change the Hemmeter plans and build a 
smaller resort more akin to the exclusive Ritz-Carlton nearby. That in turn 
worried local officials, who were concerned that the smaller hotel might bring 
in less tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
They also worried about Qintex's other plans. In order to bring in some money 
while the hotel was getting on its feet, Qintex was likely to ask permission to 
build and sell houses nearby. The land, however, came with permission to build 
only a hotel, and local officials opposed building houses because they said it 
might aggravate traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Krause said the Qintex proposal seemed the best use of the land. She also 
said the City Council will look strictly at future proposals to make sure that 
they are resort-oriented and that they minimize traffic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point City Manager William O. Talley said it is too early to gauge the 
effect of Qintex's action on the city. "It would be foolish to speculate on the 
impact of this," he said. "The city is not in any position to control the 
events." 
</P>
<P>
If Qintex also sells the Monarch Beach property, it is likely to be bought by 
Japanese interests, sources said. When Qintex was again overburdened with debt 
earlier this year, it sold half its interest in three resorts -- two in 
Australia and one in Hawaii -- for $350 million to two Japanese companies, 
Mitsui &amp; Co. and Nippon Shinpan Co. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when Qintex announced that it was selling the rest of its interest 
in those resorts as part of a major restructuring, stock analysts said it was 
likely that Mitsui, Nippon and perhaps other Japanese companies would be among 
the bidders. The Japanese are avid investors in resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Dana Point property is sold depends largely on how soon Qintex can 
sell its other three resorts and what it can get for them, according to one 
source. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui and Nippon are already familiar with the Dana Point properties, since as 
part of their March deal to buy Qintex's resorts they got first crack at 
becoming partners with Qintex in the Dana Point resort. They have been talking 
to Qintex about investing in Dana Point for months, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
The development announced Thursday was the latest in a series of mishaps that 
have tarnished Qintex's once golden image. A U.S. subsidiary, Qintex 
Entertainment Inc., recently filed for bankruptcy when it failed to meet a 
$5.9-million payment to MCA Inc.

Map, Dana Point Deal Crumbles -- The Australian company Qintex has given up its 
option to buy a 115-acre property in Dana Point, a move that will probably kill 
its efforts to develop a luxurious beach resort. In July Qintex agreed to buy 
the property, known as the Headlands, along with a 232-acre parcel at Monarch 
beach. Qintex said Thursday it planned to keep the Monarch Beach property, 
which it bought outright. But company officials said earlier it would be hard 
to develop a successful resort if it did not encompass both properties.

OPRAH: It's billed as "An Afternoon With Oprah Winfrey," but no one -- not even 
Winfrey -- knows exactly what the TV talk show queen will do on stage Sunday at 
Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre. . . . A press release mentions "an inspiring and 
uplifting mix of stories, anecdotes and dramatic interpretations" but her 
spokesman says Winfrey never knows in advance what she is going to talk about. 
. . . Fans don't seem to care: the 2,500-seat theater sold out three weeks ago.

ROHRABACHER ASKS DRUG TESTS FOR U.S. HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher called on Congress Thursday to open a 
Capitol Hill front in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher introduced legislation that would allow members of the House of 
Representatives to use money set aside to run their offices to pay for drug 
tests for themselves and their congressional staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress is not exempt from the war on drugs," said Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
"Drug testing is a way that we can prove we have personally joined the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said he saw no conflict between the drug initiative and his 
political background as a Libertarian. The Libertarian philosophy calls for 
minimal government regulation of citizens' private lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to sneak up on people and put them in jail," Rohrabacher 
said. "What we're trying to do is provide incentives in our system to people 
who might be susceptible to drug abuse and give them an incentive not to use 
drugs." Despite endorsements by eight other congressmen who attended a Capitol 
Hill press conference, Rohrabacher's suggestion to test staff members did not 
meet with universal approval. 
</P>
<P>
"How about testing for typing? Let's start with that," said Rep. Andy Jacobs 
(D-Ind.). "There is the doctrine of probable cause before we start searching 
and seizing people's blood. . . . I'm getting a little tired of spending 
taxpayers' money for political grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said 
random drug testing is "a terrible waste of money as well as a dreadful 
invasion of privacy, often casting suspicion on innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
"The way to detect drug or alcohol problems," Edwards added, "is for members to 
closely supervise their staffs and their work, which they should always be 
doing anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires all federal agencies, including the offices of individual 
congressmen and congressional committees, to establish policies to keep drugs 
out of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
However, the House Committee on Administration has ruled that House members 
cannot use funds from their office budgets to pay for drug testing because 
there are no provisions for it in federal law. Rohrabacher's legislation would 
reverse that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We are specifically prohibited from using our office expenses to promote a 
drug-free environment through the use of random drug testing," Rohrabacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's irresponsible for Congress to encourage one policy through laws 
in the public and private sector and then make that policy unworkable for our 
own offices." 
</P>
<P>
Aides said at least three congressmen -- E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), Joe Barton 
(R-Tex.), and Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) -- already test staff members for drug 
use, apparently paying for it with their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
In Rohrabacher's office, staff members are required to sign a letter pledging 
to avoid drug use and agreeing "to submit to drug testing, when and as deemed 
appropriate by Congressman Rohrabacher." 
</P>
<P>
If a staff member were to test positive, a second test would be performed, 
according to the terms of the letter. If the second test were positive, 
Rohrabacher said he would reserve the right to fire the employee or refer him 
to a drug counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
If his funding bill is enacted, Rohrabacher said, he will contract with a 
private testing company to periodically test his staff and himself for drug 
use. (During his 1988 election campaign, Rohrabacher, 42, declined to discuss 
whether he had ever used marijuana as a college student.) 
</P>
<P>
Among those joining Rohrabacher at Thursday's press conference were Reps. C. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). 
Dannemeyer said he had conducted drug testing among his staff several years ago 
at his own expense. All the staff members passed, a Dannemeyer aide said later. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to convince the American people that we, the political leaders 
of this country, are serious about stopping drug use in this nation, we have to 
set an example," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for passage are uncertain. The Rohrabacher legislation is 
co-sponsored by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and a dozen other congressmen, 
Rohrabacher aides said. They said the bill probably would be referred to the 
House Committee on Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"If it gets to the floor, it would pass so that in the next election members 
would not be accused of being pro-drugs," Edwards said. "But we hope it does 
not reach the floor because it would be a serious constitutional violation." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher noted that "once these funds are available, the public will be able 
to determine who's serious and who's not about the war on drugs by what policy 
they've instituted in their own offices."

<P>
You never know unless you ask. So I did. 
</P>
<P>
"What's B&amp;D?," I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Bondage and Discipline," came the response, a bit surprised, in that 
oh-come-on-where-have-you-been tone. 
</P>
<P>
OK, guess this is the time for a little context. It was sex we were talking 
about at the offices of the Lifestyles Organization, an average, plain-brown 
wrapper kind of place in Anaheim. Sitting across the table from me were the 
experts, or at least they claim to be, and who was I to challenge their 
credentials? 
</P>
<P>
"Bondage and Discipline?" I said. "What's that mean? You tie someone up and 
tell him he's been a bad boy?" 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't bad, the experts thought. But it was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Friend, the director of educational research at the Lifestyles 
Organization, gave me a friendly, educational explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say a couple goes out somewhere and one of them forgets to hold the door 
open for the other and let's say that this was a breach of the rules of their 
relationship," she said. "When they get home, the one who broke the rule would 
be punished." 
</P>
<P>
Well, forgive me all you readers who can't believe where I've been either, but 
I thought that was a little funny. Fact is I laughed out loud when I heard 
Jenny Friend's friendly explanation and OK, I may have used the word weird. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, let's examine why you think that's weird," said Dr. Robert McGinley, 
president of the Lifestyles Organization and the North American Swing Club 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor (he has a Ph.D. in psychology) was very serious when he said this. I 
think he may have been stroking his beard. 
</P>
<P>
But I wasn't interested in examining my own fetishes. It was their fetishes I 
was interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Which is how we got to talking about B&amp;D in the first place. B&amp;D was 
just one of the many fun offerings at the recent Lifestyles '89 convention, the 
15th annual, in Las Vegas. About 3,000 people with so-called alternative life 
styles showed up and as usual, the experts reported, they had a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
(At least a G-string was required at the Erotic Masquerade Ball, but other than 
that, the rules of the two-day convention were pretty flexible.) 
</P>
<P>
Now since I missed the convention myself, McGinley was kind enough to supply me 
with a program, similar to a college course catalogue, except that this one has 
helpful illustrations and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
I confess that I was rather intrigued by one seminar, "The ABCs of Swinging," 
but then again, I would have been intrigued with "Motorcycle Maintenance Made 
Easy," if it were taught by someone named Honey Bear Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
After checking out Honey Bear's photograph, the one where her husband, John, is 
clutching her knee to a place well above his own, I wouldn't be surprised if 
Honey Bear knew something about motorcycles as well. 
</P>
<P>
That was the point that McGinley and friendly Jenny were trying to make about 
people with "alternative life styles" in general. These are people in touch 
with the world and with themselves. They are sensual explorers, with a strong 
sense of curiosity and wonder, people who have thrown off the shackles of the 
so-called "traditional life style." 
</P>
<P>
These are people who are really into sex. 
</P>
<P>
Not that sex is all they do, mind you. (I mean, people have to sleep, don't 
they?) 
</P>
<P>
Jenny wanted to make sure that I understood this point. 
</P>
<P>
"People have this idea about swingers, that all we do is trade off sexual 
partners, go into separate rooms and have sex. It's not like that. It's not a 
bartering system. There is a whole social interaction. I know my husband and I, 
for example, we never go into separate rooms. It's a group of people 
interacting with each other." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you mean an orgy?" I said, rather knowledgeably I thought. 
</P>
<P>
That was when McGinley jumped in. There I went, the media, using one of those 
"very biased words" like orgy. Fleshpot was another one that McGinley 
mentioned, but I'll have you know, it never crossed my own lips. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a respectable community," McGinley said. "Your neighbor, your lawyer, 
your policeman, the kindergarten teachers; these are the swingers of America!" 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County alone, he claimed, there are "thousands and thousands" of 
swingers. The active mailing list for the Lifestyles Organization -- "there's 
no other organization like it in the world" -- stands at 16,000. There are an 
estimated 3 million swingers in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
"And Orange County probably has more swingers in it than any other part of the 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This got me to thinking -- about my neighbor, my lawyer, my policeman and all 
those kindergarten teachers. I mean, what do I really know about these people? 
How much do I really want to know about these people? 
</P>
<P>
I decided that I didn't really want to know that much. After all, it was a 
professional interview I was conducting here. 
</P>
<P>
"What about AIDS?" I asked, professional-like. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is not a problem," McGinley said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
So on my way out, I asked if the doctor would mind parting with a few more 
pieces of educational literature on the North American Swing Club Assn. and the 
Lifestyles Organization. It was the scholarly approach I was after. 
</P>
<P>
But as long as I've got you this far, I'll pass on a little practical 
information as well. 
</P>
<P>
There's a one-hour photo shop in Buena Park that will develop all your 
"personal erotic photography" with no questions asked. Make sure to mention 
Lifestyles for a discount.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MODJESKA CANYON;

<P>
RESIDENTS CHALLENGE PLANS FOR HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what some members of this sleepy canyon community called the largest show of 
civic unity in years, Modjeska Canyon residents on Thursday challenged county 
plans to renovate the historic house once owned by renowned Shakespearean 
actress Helena Modjeska. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that a county proposal to build a 14-acre historic park around the 
century-old home would shatter the pastoral calm of Modjeska Canyon, more than 
100 residents of the 180-home tract filled a community center to object to the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Modjeska house would be a centerpiece in county plans to create a historic 
park in Modjeska Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to planning guided tours of the historic home, the county wants to 
install a nature trail, picnic grounds and exhibit hall on the site. Special 
events, such as music recitals, poetry readings and art exhibits, could be held 
at night under the county proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, alcohol and amplified music would be banned, said Kathie Matsuyama, 
senior landscape architect for Orange County and project coordinator for the 
Modjeska home. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Modjeska settled in Orange County more than 100 years ago, and the 
Polish native entertained internationally known luminaries in the sprawling 
bungalow's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Stanford White, one of America's finest architects, the building is 
said to emulate architecture of the East Indies, most notably in its open 
porches at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
The county plans to open the home to the public in 1991, when structural 
repairs are expected to be finished. The county may allow weddings, receptions 
and other events to take place on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the village under Modjeska Peak fear increased traffic and 
boisterous wedding parties would destroy the solitude they enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the house when it was severly decayed in 1986 for $1 million. 
In addition to the purchase price, the county invested $320,000 to do emergency 
repairs, which are still under way. 
</P>
<P>
The county has several plans to hold down traffic when the home opens to the 
public, such as free on-site parking intended to keep visitors from leaving 
their cars along public streets and an off-site parking lot served by shuttle 
buses. The county may also require buses for wedding parties or other groups 
that receive permits to use the grounds. FRANK MESSINA

NO STATE OPINION IN CITY ATTORNEY LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office has declined to give an opinion on whether 
four City Council members have the power to put City Atty. Edward J. Cooper on 
a 60-day administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Assistant Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill recommended that the city ask the 
state for a special quo warranto proceeding, a method of settling disputes over 
the rights and procedures of a public office. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that under state law, the attorney general's office is not authorized 
to provide a legal opinion to a city council. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who refuses to leave his post, said he had advised councilmen John 
Acosta, Ron May, Richards L. Norton and Miguel A. Pulido that the quo warranto 
proceeding was the proper procedure, rather than seeking a formal opinion from 
the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
The four councilmen could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 17, the four council members voted to put Cooper on a 60-day leave of 
absence without saying why they wanted him removed from his post. But Mayor 
Daniel H. Young has said they are retaliating against Cooper for previous legal 
battles three of the four men have had with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has refused to step aside, saying that the city charter requires five 
votes on the seven-member council to put him on administrative leave. The four 
councilmen counter that Cooper is disregarding the wishes of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who along with council members Daniel E. Griset and Patricia A. McGuigan 
support Cooper, has called for a grand jury investigation of the attempt to 
have Cooper removed. LILY ENG

COUNCIL BEEFS UP VICIOUS ANIMALS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted unanimously to strengthen an existing law defining 
vicious animals and the responsibilities of their owners. 
</P>
<P>
The update to a 1983 ordinance creates an appeal process for the owner of a pet 
declared vicious by city animal control officers. Allowing an appeal could 
prevent the city from destroying an animal that is wrongly declared vicious, 
said Capt. Tom Dailey of the city Fire Department, which oversees animal 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The stronger wording also says that an animal owner can be found negligent if 
the pet attacks someone while in the owner's control. 
</P>
<P>
If an animal is declared vicious, based on previously reported attacks on other 
animals or against people, it must be muzzled when taken out in public, and 
must be kept in an enclosure at the owner's home. New wording adopted Wednesday 
defines the enclosure as a four-walled area that the animal cannot escape.

PROSECUTOR DEFENDS ARSON ARREST DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside County prosecutor Thursday defended his decision to wait 2 1/2 
years in arresting a former Israeli beauty queen on charges of arson and 
insurance fraud involving her Palm Springs home. 
</P>
<P>
Orly Hadida, who was married to Santa Ana surgeon Ron Lapin and acquitted in a 
highly publicized Orange County child-stealing case in 1988, was arrested by an 
investigator of the Riverside County district attorney's office during a 
monitored visitation with her two children Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Hadida's attorney, John Horwitz of Santa Ana, criticized the location and 
timing of the arrest and said it occurred 10 days after she filed for increased 
visitation time. 
</P>
<P>
But Riverside County prosecutor David B. Downing rejected any notion that her 
arrest was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about the status of her, her husband or her kids, and I 
couldn't care less," Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to take some witnesses' statements and had to wait. We had heard 
that she never gave a sworn statement to her insurance company, and then we 
heard otherwise and had to wait and get the statement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest stems from an arson fire at Hadida's Palm Springs home the night of 
June 2, 1987. The home, with an estimated value of between $200,000 and 
$300,000, was awarded to her as a part of her divorce agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who did not have exact figures, characterized the damage as 
"substantial" to the structure and its contents. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, she was separated from her husband, but the home was in her name 
and not her husband's, Ron Lapin," Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Hadida had been living at the home, which was unoccupied at the time of 
the fire. No one was injured in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs fire investigators said that flammable liquids were used to set 
the house on fire, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"She made a claim to the insurance company, but they didn't pay her anything," 
Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
Hadida pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of arson and insurance fraud 
during an arraignment in Palm Springs last month. A preliminary hearing has 
been scheduled in Palm Springs Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz said he took exception with the decision to arrest his client in view 
of the long period after the incident, and that Downing had been quoted in a 
newspaper as saying that no new dramatic evidence had been uncovered in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the catalyst is," Horwitz said. "The deputy district 
attorney in the case says he really hasn't gotten any new evidence, and then 
she's arrested 2 1/2 years later." 
</P>
<P>
Hadida remains free on $10,000 bail. DAVID REYES

RECREATION PANEL OKS 15-ACRE PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Seal Beach Recreation and Parks Commission unanimously approved the latest 
plan for a 15-acre park that Mola Development Corp. has agreed to build for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will cost Mola an estimated $1.4 million to build and allows for all 
but two of the commission's nine revisions to the original $1.1-million 
proposal, which was conditionally approved by the Seal Beach City Council in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed park would be adjacent to the wetlands on the Hellman Ranch 
property in southwest Seal Beach, where Mola has plans for a 355-unit 
residential project. Mola is developing the park and is dedicating an 
additional 50 acres of nearby property to Seal Beach as part of the company's 
development agreement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The park plan, which will now be submitted to the City Council for 
finalapproval, includes eight tennis courts, two basketball courts, a sand 
volleyball court and a 2,000-square-foot community center. Also included would 
be a gazebo, a raised viewing area near the wetlands, a picnic area, playing 
fields and modest landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will not begin on the residential development or the park until 
the company's plans receive final approval from the state Coastal Commission, 
which will meet to review the proposal on Nov. 14. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

BUILDING INSPECTORS RETURN FROM S.F. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton building inspectors Jim Lace and Nick Lopez have returned from San 
Francisco where they aided in the earthquake relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 26, Lace, Lopez and 88 other building inspectors and structural 
engineers from Southern California boarded a National Guard transport plane for 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, coordinated by the Office of Emergency Services and the Orange County 
Management Agency, was an effort to help meet the flood of building-inspection 
requests by San Francisco residents. 
</P>
<P>
Lace and Lopez spent two days examining buildings in the Richmond District and 
flew back on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond District consists largely of Victorian homes but did not suffer as 
much damage in the Oct. 17 quake as did the Marina District because it was 
built on natural, compacted soil rather than uncompacted soil, Lace said. 
</P>
<P>
Lace and Lopez worked 12-hour days in San Francisco and examined 40 buildings, 
going over the structures, plumbing, and whatever else needed inspecting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly it was a lot of hand-holding and we saw some basic cracking," Lace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pair saw a lot of cracked walls, stucco and bricks, they did not 
have to declare any buildings unsafe for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we got there, the really severely hit areas had been inspected and 
cordoned off already," Lace said. 
</P>
<P>
But they saw many buildings demolished in the Marina District, where the 
inspection team met each morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They would make piles after demolishing the buildings, and people came and 
looked through the piles for their belongs," Lace said. "It was really sad."

<P>
Nathan Hashbarger was not thinking about drugs or the problem of teen 
pregnancies when he arrived at the school district's headquarters for a meeting 
early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But Hashbarger, 13-year-old student body vice president at Isaac L. Sowers 
Middle School in Huntington Beach, and two dozen other middle school students 
were shortly to confront those issues and other difficult questions. 
</P>
<P>
They started by meeting Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President John F. 
Kennedy. They then were whisked off to a daylong workshop aimed at improving 
each student's sense of self-worth as a way of grappling with tough teen 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, after an accidental encounter with Huntington Beach City School 
District Supt. Diana Peters at a January statewide superintendents' conference 
in Monterey, offered to help set up a self-esteem program in Huntington Beach 
through the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The temptations of drugs and sex for young people can be overcome only through 
a healthy sense of self-esteem, said Shriver, who is well known for her work on 
mental retardation and for the Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is picking up the $6,000 tab to get the Community of Caring 
program started. The Long Beach Unified School District is the only other 
school system in the area to have such a program. 
</P>
<P>
After attending initial workshops, teachers and students will develop 
activities to carry back to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Hashbarger and the other students who attended workshops Wednesday and Thursday 
are not problem children. They will become role models to others later, back at 
their home schools. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver mingled with about 100 guests, including program co-sponsors from the 
Huntington Beach Chamber of Commerce, over coffee, juice and rolls before 
Thursday's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Shriver said the Kennedy Foundation started the program after 
finding that teen-age mothers give birth to more retarded children, 
proportionally, than do adult mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the business of trying to prevent retardation, and there was 
evidence that some parents of retarded children lack parenting skills -- they 
don't take care of their own health, getting into drug abuse and alcohol, and 
so the health of the fetus becomes impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear that giving young mothers and fathers a sense of values and 
responsibility in order to make choices was something we needed to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't inflict any values," Shriver said, "but we ask the participants to 
examine their own values and see how they apply to difficult situations." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students did not fully appreciate who Shriver is. So Robert E. 
Anastasi, a former school principal from Maryland who directs the Community of 
Caring program for the Kennedy Foundation, told them that Shriver is the 
mother-in-law of actor-muscleman Arnold Schwartzenegger and mother of TV news 
anchor Maria Shriver -- in that order. There was instant recognition and 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
In one of several videotapes shown during the day to challenge the students to 
be critical thinkers, two teen-agers were shown arguing about sex. The boy is 
pressuring his girlfriend to sleep with him, using arguments such as "If you 
really loved me . . ." and "You can't get pregnant the first time anyway." The 
girl's mother refuses to talk about sex. 
</P>
<P>
Hashbarger was in a group of two girls who, by the expressions on their faces, 
were obviously skittish. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," one girl said when asked whether she would feel comfortable asking 
her mother or a trusted teacher about sex. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he has heard any "smoothies" in the videotape that he would use 
on girls, Hashbarger replied: "If you really love me." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking up with a boy who is too insistent "isn't very easy if you're going 
with somebody," said Shelley Caplan, a student at Ethel Dwyer Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
Hashbarger said, "What this program is striving for is getting people to talk 
and plan, and not to deal only with the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Nervously fingering a ring she had removed, Caplan said: "Yeah, he (the boy in 
the videotape) should think about the future. . . . They should talk to each 
other and decide whether they're ready to have a family." 
</P>
<P>
There was no happy ending. Restarting the videotape, the students saw that the 
girl gets pregnant and her boyfriend splits. 
</P>
<P>
"Hsss!" "Boo!" said the kids.

SUPERVISORS ASK PLAN FOR S. COUNTY AGENCIES;

Citing rapid growth and the "piecemeal" approach to providing government 
facilities, two county supervisors Thursday called for a new plan on how the 
county will provide services for the more than 500,000 people now living in the 
southern part of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the board, Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley said 
that more and more of the time of county staffers is being taken up by a 
35-mile-plus drive between the government civic center in Santa Ana and 
locations in the South County. 
</P>
<P>
"With the rapid growth of South Orange County, it is imperative that the county 
provide more accessible government services in that region," the letter said. 
"South Orange County now includes more than 500,000 people, covering an expanse 
of land up to 35 miles from the County Civic Center in Santa Ana. More and more 
residents and county staff time is consumed by traversing these 35 miles on a 
daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
The two supervisors continued: "In light of ongoing budget constraints and an 
ever-increasing demand for efficiency, the county needs to develop a long-range 
plan for providing services for that region well into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
Various facilities are under discussion, the letter said, including a new, 
expanded south court, a sheriff's substation and a social services office. 
</P>
<P>
The board is expected to make a decision in January on financing a full-service 
office in Laguna Hills to serve welfare recipients in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Financing the office became a heated issue recently when county officials 
closed a small welfare office in San Juan Capistrano, forcing many welfare 
clients to go instead to an office in Costa Mesa. Because of strong public 
reaction, the office was reopened less than a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and Vasquez, whose districts cover South County, pointed out that in 
addition to the need for a court, sheriff's substation and social services 
facilities, the county for the last two years has been unsuccessful in 
negotiating space in South County for the public defender and probation 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Building or leasing one facility at a time piecemeal-fashion may preclude our 
option to deliver the best services in the most cost-effective manner 
possible," the letter to the board said. " . . . We believe that the time has 
come to develop a well-planned approach to providing services to South County." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said in an interview that developing a mid- and long-range plan may be 
overdue, noting that the cost of land in South County is rising. He said there 
should be permanent county government facilities "that don't move from place to 
place." 
</P>
<P>
He agreed it is possible that some land could be set aside for courts, 
substations or county government buildings through agreements with developers 
who plan to build projects in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Riley had a similar proposal aimed at looking for building sites for government 
facilities in South County four or five years ago, according to Christie 
Mcdaniel, his executive assistant, but it did not receive much support. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez and Riley are expected to direct the General Services Agency and the 
county administrative office next week to assess the needs based on population 
projections in South County and the type, size and location of facilities and 
the resources available to pay for them.

RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE SHOT IN HOLDUP

<P>
Armed bandits shot a restaurant employee and then locked him and the manager in 
a walk-in freezer before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Wednesday night after the Seafood Show Restaurant, on 
Centerpointe Drive, had closed for the day. Police said the bandits, who wore 
hooded sweat shirts, entered the restaurant around 11.45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During the ordeal, one bandit shot dishwasher Ismael Castillo Aguillon, 20, of 
La Palma, in the back. 
</P>
<P>
After grabbing some money, the robbers pushed the bleeding Aguillon and manager 
Jerome Albert Aguirre into a walk-in freezer and fled, police said. The two 
restaurant employees, however, were able to escape within minutes. Police and 
paramedics took Aguillon to the La Palma Intercommunity Hospital, where he was 
treated for a gunshot wound and released.

When the Laurel Futurity was run two weeks ago, it figured to be a dreary 
event. Not a soul -- not even the trainers of the horses or the most optimistic 
members of the track's management -- could have dreamed that the future winner 
of the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile might be in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain forced the transfer of the Futurity, one of the events in the 
International Turf Festival, from the grass to the dirt. Virtually all of the 
horses in the fields had been racing principally on the grass; the European 
horses in the lineups had never set foot on a dirt track before. Whoever won 
the Futurity was likely to do it by default. 
</P>
<P>
Instead an invader from Ireland, Go and Go, and a Maryland-based colt, Robyn 
Dancer, waged a stirring duel. Robyn Dancer opened an early lead, but Go and Go 
fought relentlessly to wear him down and ended up winning in a photo finish. 
Yet the most stunning aspect of the Futurity was not the drama of the stretch 
run, but the time of the race. 
</P>
<P>
When I sat down with the Laurel charts to make my normal speed-figure 
calculations, I had trouble believing the results. The Futurity had been the 
fastest race for 2 year olds in America this year. Both Go and Go and Robyn 
Dancer had earned a figure that would normally be good enough to win the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile and an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
I know that speed handicapping sometimes produces figures that have to be 
dismissed as aberrations. If the winner of a daily-double race at Timonium 
should run as if he were the second coming of Secretariat, I would dismiss the 
result as a fluke -- possibly created by the electric timer or a sudden change 
in the racing surface. 
</P>
<P>
But there was nothing freakish about the Futurity. The Laurel racing surface 
seemed to be consistent all day. Sweet Roberta had won the Selima Stakes that 
afternoon in 1:46 for 1 1/16 miles, and she must have delivered an excellent 
effort to win by 10 lengths. An hour later Go and Go won the Futurity at the 
same distance in 1:44 -- a performance vastly superior to that of Sweet 
Roberta. 
</P>
<P>
If several horses had been clustered together at the finish of the Futurity, I 
still might have distrusted the time, since it would have been implausible for 
so many horses to run so well. But Go and Go and Robyn Dancer finished 10 1/2 
lengths ahead of the third-place finisher. The conclusion was inescapable: Both 
colts had run brilliant races, and they are the two best horses in the $1 
million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But this remains a minority opinion. Go and Go and Robyn Dancer are listed, 
respectively, at 15 to 1 and 20 to 1 in Gulfstream Park's morning line, and the 
trainers of both are talking as if they are taking a long-shot flyer by running 
in the country's richest and most important race for 2 year olds. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jerry Robb doesn't know quite what to make of Robyn Dancer -- whether 
his good showing in the Futurity was due to an exceptional effort or to the 
weakness of the field. He did make note of the fast time and the big gap 
between his colt and the third-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
But he is clearly not convinced that Robyn Dancer is a budding champion, since 
owner John E. Owens sold the colt Wednesday to a California-based stable. The 
price was believed to be in the vicinity of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said he would continue to prepare Robyn Dancer for the Breeders' Cup but 
will turn him over to trainer Darrell Vienna after the race. He thought the 
colt ought to run better here with the addition of blinkers, and with the 
acquisition of Angel Cordero Jr. as his jockey. Cordero actively solicited the 
mount, telling Robb he wasn't impressed by the favorites in the race, 
Adjudicating and Rhythm, both of whom he has ridden.

LUCAS HELPS RUN CORONA DEL MAR OFFENSE OUT OF ITS SLUMP

Boosted by a record-setting performance by running back Brian Lucas, Corona del 
Mar High School pulled itself out of its mini-slump and back into position for 
a Southern Section playoff berth Thursday night with a 25-8 Sea View League 
victory over University at Newport Harbor High School. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas rushed for 234 yards in 26 carries to surpass the school record of 227 
set in 1966 by Tom Westgate against Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The linemen blocked real well; I'll be taking them all to breakfast Saturday 
morning," said Lucas, who also scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave two-time defending league champion Corona del Mar (6-3 
overall, 2-2 in league play) renewed hope. Especially after last week's 24-7 
loss to Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lucas gained 96 yards in the first half, his most dazzling runs came 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
On Corona del Mar's first possession of the third quarter, Lucas had 
consecutive gains of 17 and 34 yards, then scored on a 16-yard sweep, giving 
the Sea Kings a 18-8 lead. Corona del Mar extended that lead late in the fourth 
quarter as sophomore quarterback Todd Kehrli hit Weston Johnson with a 16-yard 
scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Until that play, though, Corona del Mar's passing offense was barely 
noticeable. Kehrli completed four of 12 passes for 55 yards with a touchdown 
and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play good last week. We weren't as intense as we should have been," 
Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland said. "We got to beat (Newport) Harbor to get 
to the playoffs. We got to win next week to make sure we get in." 
</P>
<P>
Although University (2-7, 0-4) already had been eliminated from playoff 
contention last week, the Trojans didn't give Corona del Mar much slack. That 
was especially evident in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
On Corona del Mar's first possession, Lucas set up his team's first touchdown 
with a 27-yard run, before scoring on a one-yard dive. Weston Johnson faked a 
punt snap and ran in for the two-point conversion, giving Corona del Mar a 8-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But University (2-7, 0-4) matched that performance in the second quarter as 
Jerry Apana, who led the running game with 89 yards in 16 carries, dove in for 
a three-yard scoring run, and Victor Davis ran in for the conversion, tying the 
score, 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
Although Corona del Mar drove as far as the University four-yard line in the 
closing seconds of the first half, penalties and a sack forced the Sea Kings to 
the 29. With time running out, Jerrott Willard kicked a 45-yard field goal to 
give Corona del Mar a 11-8 lead going into halftime.

JULIAN RUNS LA QUINTA PAST LOS AMIGOS

<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Tom Julian of Garden Grove High School was one of the 
top running backs and sprinters in Orange County. Two decades later, his 
youngest son, Trent, is following in his father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Julian rushed for 132 yards in 13 carries and caught six passes for 62 
yards to lead La Quinta High School to a 37-3 victory over Los Amigos Thursday 
night at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved La Quinta (5-4 overall, 4-2 in league play) a half game ahead 
of Bolsa Grande, Kennedy and Rancho Alamitos in the race for second place in 
the eight-team league. Los Amigos is 2-7, 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
Julian utilized his exceptional cutting ability to repeatedly burn Los Amigos 
for long gains, but he scored only once. La Quinta intercepted two passes and 
recovered two fumbles, setting up an easy score in the second quarter and two 
in the third to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Julian was impressive considering torn cartilage in his right knee has reduced 
his speed and forced him to miss La Quinta's opening three games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's running at about 85% capacity," said Roger Takahashi, La Quinta's coach. 
"If he was running with the speed he had this summer, he'd really be 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Julian injured the knee in La Quinta's night scrimmage before its season opener 
against Westminster and didn't play until midway through La Quinta's league 
opener against Santiago three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors think he might have injured his knee a long time ago and then 
aggravated it in the scrimmage," Takahashi said. "He's going to need 
arthroscopic surgery after the season, or he might wait until after basketball 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Equally impressive for La Quinta was quarterback Richard Weaver. Weaver 
completed 11 of 15 passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns. Weaver connected 
with wide receiver Jason Cherms on a seven-yard scoring play and teamed with 
tight end Todd Harvey on an 11-yard touchdown pass as La Quinta opened a 14-3 
lead in the second quarter and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
The victory avenged a 13-10 loss to Los Amigos last season that kept La Quinta 
from advancing to the playoffs.

The timing seemed perfect for San Clemente High School's football team Thursday 
night against El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, the No. 1 ranked team in Orange County, defeated Mission Viejo last 
week. Next Friday, the Chargers take on No. 2 Capistrano Valley, in a game that 
likely will decide the South Coast League championship. 
</P>
<P>
So the Chargers could have been excused for looking at Thursday night's game 
against San Clemente, winless in league play, as a respite. 
</P>
<P>
But not this time. Showing no signs of looking ahead, El Toro (9-0 overall, 4-0 
in league) took a 28-0 lead at the half and held on to win, 34-7, at Mission 
Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said his team realized that despite the last-place 
standing of San Clemente (3-6, 0-4), it wasn't a team to be overlooked. Johnson 
admitted, however, that his players probably had some thoughts about next 
week's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to be in the back of their minds," Johnson said. "I'm just glad that's 
where it stayed." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro quarterback Steve Stenstrom was steady as always, completing eight of 
10 passes for 116 yards and two touchdowns before leaving the game late in the 
second quarter. By that time the Chargers were ahead, 21-0, and Stenstrom's 
replacement at quarterback, Rob Johnson, had caught six passes for 91 yards and 
a touchdown. The Chargers soon made it 28-0 on a 36-yard touchdown run by 
Jerome Oakman, who finished with 108 yards in 10 carries and also scored on a 
20-yard run on the third play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente gained a semblance of respect in the second half by outscoring the 
Chargers, 7-6. The Tritons, who only had 29 yards in total offense and two 
first downs in the first half, moved the ball much better in the second. Juan 
Maldonado broke through the El Toro line and scored on a 61-yard run in the 
third quarter.

Los Alamitos High School came into Thursday's Empire League game against El 
Dorado with seven victories, seven more than El Dorado. So it came as no 
surprise that the Griffins, ranked fourth in Orange County, defeated El Dorado 
at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
What was a bit odd was the score: 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-eight points, I think that's enough." Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes 
said. But this was a game that heavily favored Los Alamitos led only 14-0 at 
the half, against an El Dorado team that had been outscored 269-19 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (4-0, 8-1) gained its yards, 398 of them in total offense, but 
usually was stopped either by itself or the El Dorado defense. Barnes admitted 
that the game was, "not one of our best," and placed some of the responsibility 
on a lackluster team attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first week of practice that we weren't screaming and yelling," he 
said. There was really never any doubt about the game's outcome. Los Alamitos 
was clearly the better team, but it didn't score its first touchdown until 14 
seconds were left in the first quarter. That came off a 24-yard drive that was 
set up by a Sean Hooker interception. LaQuan Beckton capped the drive with a 
three-yard scoring run. Beckton replaced starting tailback Erik Mitchell, who 
injured his ankle in the first half. Beckton gained 87 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' next two drives got into El Dorado territory, but both ended -- 
one on an interception and the other when a fourth-down play failed. Los 
Alamitos got the ball back with 1:10 remaining and on its second play 
quarterback Todd Gragnano, who completed 13 of 23 passes for 181 yards, 
completed a 60-yard pass to Chad Millan for a touchdown.

2 IRVINE FIRMS FAILED TO DISCLOSE RECALLS, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>

<P>
Manufacturers of medical devices ranging from pacemakers to pediatric cribs are 
failing to notify federal officials of potentially dangerous defects and 
deciding for themselves whether to recall the faulty equipment, according to 
two new congressional studies. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly half of the highest-risk equipment recalls of the last five years, 
the Food and Drug Administration was not aware that manufacturers had begun 
removing them from the market until after the process had begun, the General 
Accounting Office found. 
</P>
<P>
Although manufacturers are not required to report recalls to the FDA, a 1984 
law requires them to notify the agency when devices may have contributed to a 
death or serious injury or when a malfunction could prove extremely hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, a research arm of Congress, found in its analysis of 1,635 medical 
device recalls in 1983-88 that manufacturers had provided the required 
notifications in just 16 of 31 high-risk recalls since the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
In 17 cases -- involving replacement heart valves, dialysis units, anesthesia 
machines and other devices -- the products were pulled from the market after 
their shortcomings were linked with patient deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the companies involved in the most serious recalls are in Southern 
California, including two Irvine companies: Shiley Inc., a manufacturer of 
artificial heart valves and respiratory and cardiopulmonary products, and 
Cooper Vision Inc., which makes tubing used in the administration of 
anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley, which has had several recalls of its valves because of manufacturing 
defects, in at least one instance in 1983 did not notify the agency of a recall 
until it was already in progress, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Cooper Vision did not give the FDA prior notice of a 1984 recall of 
defective aspiration tubing, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the GAO's companion reports, one of which contains an overview of the 
issue while the other looks at specific recalls in detail, were obtained by The 
Times in advance of their scheduled release today. 
</P>
<P>
"FDA became aware of the great majority of device problems associated with a 
recall in some other way than through (reports from the manufacturers)," the 
GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that the reports have not served as an effective 'early warning' 
of device problems serious enough to warrant a recall," the oversight agency 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA learned of the majority of recalls through inspections of company 
records and notification by users or competitors, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO also found that the FDA has failed to establish performance standards, 
as required under a 1976 law, for devices involved in nearly three-quarters of 
the recalls. 
</P>
<P>
That law established three categories of medical devices based on their 
potential safety risks. Manufacturers are required to submit premarketing 
documentation to prove the safety and effectiveness of devices deemed high 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is supposed to establish performance standards for medium-risk devices, 
while less stringent safety requirements apply to the least risky devices. 
Ironically, moderate-risk devices were responsible for a majority of the 
recall-related defects that the FDA said posed the greatest danger. 
</P>
<P>
The medical equipment industry generates sales of nearly $14 billion a year and 
produces more than 1,700 products, including virtually every device used by 
health-care professionals to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries, 
excluding medications. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDA had not yet seen the GAO reports, spokesmen said Thursday that 
the agency feels that the information it is receiving from medical device 
producers is sufficient to safeguard consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"We think manufacturers are complying with the reporting requirements, and 
we're looking at the incidents that happen with the products and coming to our 
own conclusions about when something needs to be done," said Walter Gundaker, 
acting deputy director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
</P>
<P>
The center is receiving 15,000 reports annually about malfunctioning medical 
devices, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said. In about 15% of the cases, the products 
are ultimately determined to have caused serious injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
Gundaker said no performance standards have been adopted for 800 devices deemed 
of medium risk when they entered the market because the formulation process is 
lengthy and "we don't have the people to put on that project." 
</P>
<P>
He said the only performance standard being developed is for apnea monitors, 
respiratory devices intended to prevent crib deaths. A number of infant deaths, 
possibly caused by failures of the machines, have attracted widespread 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO studies, which were based on FDA computer records and interviews with 
agency officials and staff, are expected to provide new ammunition for 
congressional critics who are seeking to strengthen the medical devices law and 
FDA oversight. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews were requested by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of 
the subcommittee on health and the environment of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee. Waxman's panel has scheduled a hearing Monday on the FDA's 
regulation of medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
The reports "show that manufacturers who profit from the sale of these products 
often act without FDA oversight in deciding whether to keep their products on 
the market when problems begin to surface," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
"When FDA doesn't even know about deaths and injuries from products that the 
manufacturers recall, how can the FDA even pretend to know about the safety of 
the thousands of other medical devices that remain on the market?" 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency is hamstrung by budget cuts and its desire to accommodate 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman and Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, have introduced legislation to toughen the 1976 medical devices law. 
A similar measure passed the House in 1987 but died in the Senate in the face 
of industry opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require hospitals and other health-care providers to begin 
informing the FDA of deaths or serious injuries that may have been caused by 
medical device malfunctions. The measure would also streamline the process 
under which the FDA can initiate recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA already has the authority to seek court-ordered recalls of medical 
devices. But the agency must show that, in addition to being dangerous, the 
devices failed to meet "the state of the art as it existed at the time of 
design and manufacture." The FDA has never initiated such a recall, agency 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no need to force a company to recall a product because the company has 
liability problems and wants to get the product off the market as well once a 
problem has been discovered," FDA spokesman Grigg said. He said the public is 
best served by persuading the company to undertake a voluntary recall. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Allen, general counsel for the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn., which 
represents the device makers, said the FDA's reporting requirements are 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain amount of discretion that is given to a company," he said. 
"The problem with the (medical device reporting) regulation is that 
well-intentioned companies interpret the same facts and the same regulatory 
requirements differently than the FDA does." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the GAO reports found that cardiovascular and anesthesiology devices 
accounted for more than a quarter of all medical device recalls. Suntanning 
booths, beds and lamps were recalled 33 times, more than any other single 
product category. Problems with design and production were the cause of nearly 
three fourths of all recalls. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shiley and Cooper Vision, the Southern California companies and 
the products they recalled are: Pacesetter Systems Inc. of Sylmar, cardiac 
pulse generators; Primary Medical Products of Los Angeles, vaporizers; 
Intermedics Intraocular Inc. of Pasadena, intraocular lenses, and Bear Medical 
Systems Inc. of Riverside, ventilators. 
</P>
<P>
Under the FDA classification system, 1,203 of the recalls, or 74%, involved 
devices considered medium risks. Another 278, or 17%, were considered least 
serious risks. A total of 153, or 9%, were in the high-risk category. 
</P>
<P>
But the GAO said, "Our analysis showed that all classes of devices -- including 
some devices that are considered relatively innocuous -- can be associated with 
problems potentially leading to serious health consequences or death."

MEDSTONE NAMES NEW PRESIDENT IN WAKE OF $1.65-MILLION LOSS 
</P>

Medstone International Inc. said Thursday that it lost $1.65 million on only 
$1.2 million in sales for the fiscal third quarter and named a representative 
of its largest stockholder as president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the helm is Jack Olshansky, a founding partner of Montgomery Medical 
Ventures, a venture capital firm which owns a 12% stake in Medstone. Medstone's 
president and vice president of regulatory affairs had both resigned in August. 
</P>
<P>
An analyst said Medstone's loss was not unexpected, and the company's stock 
moved up 75 cents to close at $7.25. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Medstone lost $1.5 million on revenue of 
$9.8 million compared to a profit of $5.8 million on revenue of $17.6 million 
in the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter last year, Medstone 
earned $2.6 million on revenue of $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"No fund manager is going to want to sit and watch his investment head south," 
said an analyst who asked not to be identified. "His appointment indicates the 
seriousness of Medstone's problems." 
</P>
<P>
Vice President David Radlinksi said: "That's certainly one interpretation. The 
other interpretation is the position has been vacant for a while and Mr. 
Olshansky is filling that." 
</P>
<P>
Medstone blamed the third-quarter loss on the fact that it had voluntarily 
stopped selling its lithotripters -- which use shock waves to crush kidney 
stones -- until it could address some concerns the Food and Drug Administration 
had about recent changes to the machine. The company said it resumed sales in 
early October. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it would pursue regulatory approval of its lithotripters for 
treatment of gallstones. Medstone recently failed to win a critical 
recommendation from an FDA panel to market the lithotripter for the gallstone 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone also announced Thursday that it had sold two lithotripters to an 
Iowa-based health care concern.

JANET JACKSON SPENDS ANOTHER WEEK AT NO. 1

Janet Jackson seems fairly secure in the No. 1 position on the Billboard pop 
album chart with "Rhythm Nation 1814," which is in its third week on top. The 
big news on the pop singles chart is that those torrid teen idols New Kids on 
the Block now have two singles in the Top 10 at the same time -- "Cover Girl" 
(No. 3) and "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)" (No. 9). This is one of rarest -- and 
most impressive -- feats in all of pop chartdom. 
</P>
<P>
* Linda Ronstadt's "Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind" is headed for the 
pop Top 10. This album, featuring Aaron Neville, shot up to No. 20 in four 
weeks, a rapid rise for a collection of ballads. The album's first single, 
"Don't Know Much," is No. 18 and also Top-10 bound.

INBAL CONDUCTS FRANKFURT RADIO SYMPHONY TONIGHT AT ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Conductor Eliahu Inbal enjoys being a wanderer. Although for almost 16 years he 
has been the principal conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony in West 
Germany, he announced his retirement from the post earlier this year in order 
to continue a Gypsy career that he began back in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always refused positions in the past because I did not feel like sitting 
in one place for too long -- I wanted to keep moving," he recalled in a phone 
conversion from New York City, a recent stop in the current tour with his 
orchestra. "But in 1974, my first child had come along and so, wanting 
something more permanent, I took the position." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Inbal will conduct his 
110-member orchestra in a program of Ravel's "Sheherazade" and "Rhapsodie 
espagnole" along with Mahler's Symphony No. 4, assisted by local soprano Arlene 
Auger. On Saturday, he undertakes Mahler's mammoth Symphony No. 6. Their 
appearance is presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I do lots of Mahler because I am asked and pressed to do Mahler," he said, 
with a sense of both humor and regret. "People consider me an authority on 
Mahler because I did a recording of his complete symphonies last year. Now I 
have a recording coming out of the symphonic works of Berlioz, so I guess I 
will become an authority on him now. 
</P>
<P>
"There are similarities and contrasts between Mahler and Ravel. What Mahler 
communicates in a macrocosm, Ravel says in miniature. They both have the same 
cosmos of conflicting ideas, ambiguity, fear, hope and lyricism." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Jerusalem 53 years ago, Inbal looks back on his career with the 
orchestra with pleasant memories and a sense of accomplishment. But now that 
his three children have grown to a comfortable traveling age, he wants to leave 
the orchestra to pursue other goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a seriousness about their work that attracted me," he replied, when 
asked about the only permanent music post he has ever held. "They were always a 
good orchestra, but I thought their potential had not yet been realized. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I want to do more opera and traveling. I will still be with the Frankfurt 
Radio Symphony as a guest conductor with concerts booked up to 1993, but I want 
the freedom to explore new things." 
</P>
<P>
But for a wanderer, Inbal has been seen very little in the Southland. In 1967 
he made his Southland conducting debut at the Hollywood Bowl with the Israel 
Philharmonic, but hasn't been seen here since. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago he brought the Frankfurt Radio Symphony to the United States for 
the first time, but tonight will be the orchestra's first (and only) West Coast 
appearance. From here it moves on to an extensive tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1928, the Radio Symphony has taken on the role of being 
an alternative to the more conservative musical societies in Frankfurt, such as 
the Frankfurt Opera and Museum. Under founder Hans Rosbaud, the orchestra has 
premiered works by Schoenberg and Bartok as well as many other 20th-Century 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
Inbal himself has premiered works by composers such as Hans Werner Henze, as 
well as several contemporary Israeli composers. The orchestra also often 
collaborates with the famous summer-school courses in new music at Darmstadt. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the avant-garde is concerned, I am very much an enthusiast," he 
insists. "The audience in Stuttgart is like any other audience around the 
world. About 5% of the public is extremely interested, 10% go along with what 
they hear, 20% are indifferent and about 60% find it disturbing to them. That 
is a very unfortunate situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those composers who are revolutionaries remain actual today. That is why I 
consider both Mahler and Ravel, as well as Beethoven, contemporary composers. 
What they say is still relevant." 
</P>
<P>
But also an unusually progressive stance is the orchestra's recent tradition of 
being led by non-Germans. Afro-American conductor Dean Dixon led the orchestra 
before Inbal, a Jew, took over. In a country still scarred from rampant racism 
during World War II, this sign of healing is refreshingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course when I first started out I was a German opponent," Inbal admitted. 
"It was very hard to forgive what some of them did. And for a while in my life, 
every thing I did was approached with this attitude. But I learned to forgive 
and go on with things. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I get along with all my students and the people in Germany. I guess the 
best proof of that is that my wife. I ended up marrying a German." 
</P>
<P>
 The Frankfurt Radio Symphony will appear tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. Tickets: $12 to $35. 
Information: (714) 556-2787.

AFTER HIS OPERA, COPELAND POPS BACK INTO ROCK; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: FORMER POLICE DRUMMER'S DEBUT ALBUM WITH ANIMAL LOGIC TRIO HAS JUST BEEN 
ISSUED. 'I DON'T LOOK AT CLASSICAL BEING BETTER THAN POP,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
After hobnobbing with the fine arts upper crust by composing an opera, "Holy 
Blood and Crescent Moon," that the Cleveland Opera premiered last month, 
Stewart Copeland has his pop shoes on again. 
</P>
<P>
The former Police drummer now devotes time to his new pop-rock band, Animal 
Logic, which features famed jazz-rock bassist Stanley Clarke and a newcomer, 
singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. The trio's debut album, "Animal Logic," has 
just been released by I.R.S. Records. 
</P>
<P>
The group will begin a series of Southern California dates Saturday at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. The band will also appear Sunday at the 
Ventura Theatre in Ventura, Tuesday at the Bacchanal in San Diego and Wednesday 
at the Palace in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In the living room of his Beverly Hills home, Copeland -- lanky, aggressive, 
hard-boiled and very authoritative -- bristled at the thought that part of the 
pop audience might consider him a snob. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because I've composed an opera doesn't mean I'm condescending toward pop 
music," said Copeland, 37, who has also written a ballet score for the San 
Francisco Ballet production of "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
"People who say that are revealing their own insecurities about pop music. I 
don't look at classical being better than pop. They're just different worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Copeland has been active in yet another world. He also composes movie scores, 
his credits including "Wall Street" and "Talk Radio." 
</P>
<P>
"I love all these different forms of music," said Copeland, who also explored 
African music in his 1985 album "The Rhythmist." 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to music, I'm the adventurous type. I'll try just about 
anything. If I don't know enough about it, I'll learn. I'm a very disciplined 
person. I do what I set my mind to." 
</P>
<P>
What is remarkable about Copeland's two-hour opera is that, before taking on 
the task, he knew absolutely nothing about the music form. Still, Cleveland 
Opera Director David Bamberger, eager to experiment with a new composer, 
commissioned him to compose the work. (Susan Shirwen wrote the libretto.) 
</P>
<P>
Some critics maintain that he still does not know what opera is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some bad reviews, but there were some good ones too," Copeland 
said. "But the opera is not perfect by any means. It needs some fine tuning. 
Some scenes need to be cut, and some need to be added." 
</P>
<P>
Copeland, who last worked with Sting and guitarist Andy Summers in the hugely 
successful Police band in 1986, started the Animal Logic project while he was 
still working on the opera. "I wanted to get back into pop music because I 
missed it," he said. "I've worked in pop for so many years, whatever else I do, 
I'll always come back to it." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Copeland was craving a pop fix. He and Clarke decided to form a 
band centered around a female singer. After an extensive search, they settled 
on Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"A publisher sent in her tape," Copeland said. "She has this depth, this 
honesty of delivery and this slight country sound that was very impressive. For 
the concept we had, she was just what we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
That concept is straight-ahead pop, with Copeland and Clarke taking a back seat 
to Holland, whose high, country-tinged vocals suggest early Linda Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, 35, is a New Jersey native who migrated to Los Angeles 10 years ago. 
She taught piano and played in piano bars for survival money, waiting for a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
But the break, Holland said, almost did not happen. Copeland and Clarke 
financed the "Animal Logic" album, then went looking for a deal: "I thought 
we'd get a record deal right away -- on the strength of their names. But we 
didn't get a deal in this country until early this year, maybe a year after we 
started. We did shows in Brazil and Europe. We showcased the band in L.A. too, 
looking for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some labels were leery of Animal Logic because they thought it was a 
one-shot project. Or maybe they didn't think it would be commercial. There was 
also another complication. Stanley and Stewart had other commitments, and they 
needed a deal that wouldn't restrict them." 
</P>
<P>
I.R.S. Records, headed by Copeland's brother, Miles, eventually offered the 
right deal. 
</P>
<P>
Animal Logic is Holland's lifeblood, but Stewart Copeland, though committed to 
the trio, has a head full of projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do everything to make this project work," he said. "But my mind 
drifts to other possible projects too. There's always other projects, some in 
other musical genres. That's what keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Animal Logic plays Saturday at 9 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $22.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

STOP-GAP WON'T LET A COMEDY BLUR ITS 'VISION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Talk to Don Laffoon about the Stop-Gap Theatre Company's latest project, Steven 
Tesich's farcical "Division Street," and the word "vision" keeps coming up. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit, Santa Ana-based drama therapy group, which Laffoon co-founded, 
is committed to vision -- it's many productions over the years have attempted 
to clarify various social concerns, including AIDS, drugs, racism and date 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
But "Division Street," a wild blow-up of aging '60s radicals trying to get 
excited about causes once again, wouldn't seem, at least on first glance, to be 
significant enough to satisfy Stop-Gap's manifesto. Those accustomed to the 
heavy stuff might wonder what happened to the relevance, the drama. 
</P>
<P>
It's in there, it's in there, Laffoon counters. Laffoon, who directs the show 
-- which opens at the Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach tonight -- maintains 
Tesich's comedy is just right for Stop-Gap. "Division Street's" vision comes 
from its inherent activism, its reminder that we all have a responsibility to 
do what we can to make the world better. 
</P>
<P>
"This play has a lot that we can relate to now because (many of the concerns 
that are brought up) are still affecting us today, like cleaning up the 
environment and the like," Laffoon explained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely within our guidelines. Usually, you can describe our plays 
with one word, like incest, but we don't want to be pigeonholed (always doing 
serious material). We don't usually get involved in politics, but we do put 
vision at the forefront, and this play has a message." 
</P>
<P>
"Division Street" centers on Chris, a former radical now living in Chicago and 
trying to make it in the establishment world. He may become an insurance agent, 
but maybe he won't. Chris, in a comic but deep way, can't really extinguish the 
blaze that made him a firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
Laffoon has updated the play, originally set in the '60s, to 1989 to make it 
more accessible to a contemporary audience and emphasize the need for social 
awareness in our time. In fact, he sees Chris as sort of a Tom Hayden character 
"trying to put his past behind him and get a real job with a future but torn by 
the need to do something." 
</P>
<P>
"Division Street" further satisfies Stop-Gap by using laughter as therapy, 
Laffoon noted. Although drama has been the group's focus, it has also staged 
Christopher Durang's black comedy "Beyond Therapy." 
</P>
<P>
"We do comedy every now and then. We believe that laughter is healing, and, I 
think, there's plenty of laughter in 'Division Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stop-Gap's "Division Street" opens tonight and plays Saturday, Thursday and 
Nov. 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 12 at 2:30 p.m. At the Forum 
Theatre on the Festival of Arts grounds, 650 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
Tickets: $10 and $12. Information: (714) 648-0135.

BIKERS REVVED UP OVER RELIGION ATTEND CHURCH LED BY EX-CON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Belly bulging, beard flowing, Bert Aguilar turns the throttle on his 
Harley-Davidson and just for a second the scream of his bike has the sound 
stream all to itself, belching out a roar that curls the eardrums. 
</P>
<P>
But then another dozen bikers hit the ignitions on their motorcycles and the 
day shatters into a bellowing, deafening cacophony of noise enveloping men and 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
The leader pulls out onto Anaheim Boulevard, and the followers trail. The black 
leather vests emblazoned with the chopper gang's "colors" portend menace, as do 
the gleams on the cycles' chrome and in the bikers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
When you see them coming, better step aside; a lot of men didn't and a lot of 
men. . . . Well, they didn't die, actually. What they did was get religious 
tracts shoved into their hands. 
</P>
<P>
These men on the two- and three-wheelers aren't Hells Angels, or Vagos, or 
Hessians. They're members of a motorcycle group called "Christ's Sons" -- it 
says so right there on the back of their vests -- and they think of themselves 
more as "Heaven's Angels," riding forth to save souls. 
</P>
<P>
The "motorcycle ministry" is part of a distinctly unconventional church in 
Anaheim known as Set Free by Christ. Its pastor, Phil Aguilar, is a 42-year-old 
ex-convict who found Jesus behind bars, went through Bible school and emerged 
to found Set Free in a friend's home nearly eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now the church operates out of a building on Anaheim Boulevard that looks like 
a warehouse, holding Sunday services outdoors in a concrete open space behind 
the structure. By 9 a.m., an hour before services start, churchgoers have 
already begun gathering. Most are in their 20s and 30s, dressed informally. 
They exchange hugs and greetings. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the building, tail-to-sidewalk and snout-to-street, the choppers start 
to line up. The pastor's is closest to the courtyard; beside it is his 
brother's; a dozen more fill out the line. Churchgoers chat about motorcycle 
suspensions and carburetors as easily as about heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Which is just the way the pastor wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"The value of having a motorcycle ministry is this," Aguilar said: "No. 1, it 
reaches out to bikers; No. 2, but just as important, it gets people who come to 
church who normally have been intimidated by bikers to get to see they're real 
people who love Jesus, too. No. 3, it goes into the subculture to where 
punkers, surfers, lowriders, everybody else says, 'Man, if they can get saved, 
I can get saved.' " 
</P>
<P>
Set Free members have a number of 1940s cars and lowrider automobiles to 
attract people favoring such vehicles. The church also rents several houses in 
Anaheim to shelter homeless families and has a ranch near Hemet that it uses as 
a detoxification facility for alcoholics and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to beat the motorcycles for grabbing attention, especially when 
they roar down the road in a pack. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar's brother Bert, 40, was a charter member of Christ's Sons when it was 
founded about seven years ago, just a few months after Set Free itself opened 
shop. Now a minister himself, Bert Aguilar figured he'd been riding motorcycles 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode with all the 'outlaw' clubs," Bert Aguilar said one morning before 
services started. "I rode with the Hessians, the Hangmen, the Hells Angels. . . 
. I was a drug smuggler 18 years," running the contraband from Mexico back 
north across the border. 
</P>
<P>
"Three or four felonies before noon was natural," he said. "It also meant I 
probably overslept." He said he'd been arrested scores of times, yet always 
dodged a felony conviction. But when brother Phil found God in Chino state 
prison and emerged to spread the gospel, brother Bert eventually was saved, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Bert said, "Biking was my hobby and smuggling was my life. 
Now, instead of selling dope I'm sharing hope." 
</P>
<P>
The Christ's Sons have appeared on the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, a religious television network, and have roared up the highway to 
Bakersfield and down to Escondido for church revivals. 
</P>
<P>
Members also tell of visiting "biker swap meets," often in Costa Mesa, and of 
handing out their religious tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their swap meet targets are "outlaw" bikers, Bert Aguilar said. "Some 
of them are in clubs, but they don't wear the colors. Guys with colors, they 
don't really wear them. It's like a target, especially for other outlaw 
bikers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the history of motorcycle gangs is replete with incidents of 
club-against-club violence with distinct similarities to the gang warfare so 
visible today, right down to drive-by shootings. And even when bikers wearing 
their colors aren't hassled by other bikers, they are rousted by police. 
Sheriff's deputies who have worked undercover to infiltrate motorcycle gangs 
tell of being pulled over six and seven times in an evening by city police in 
their black-and-whites. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Giles of the Orange County Sheriff's Department special investigations 
division said deputies "started putting the hurt" to outlaw bikers a dozen 
years ago, and as a result Orange County is just about the only Southern 
California county without a Hells Angels chapter. The Hessians, founded in 
Orange County, have also been quiet since one of their founders was jailed five 
years ago on murder charges, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
Outlaw bikers "are still around," Giles said, "but they're not high profile 
like they were." A spokeswoman for the state Justice Department said that many 
outlaw motorcycle gangs in California are involved in manufacturing and 
distributing drugs, especially methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
But the Christ's Sons don't cause any problems, according to Anaheim Police Lt. 
Marc Hedgpeth. 
</P>
<P>
"We see their motorcycles parked on Anaheim Boulevard," Hedgpeth said. And 
although police have had their troubles with other motorcycle gangs in years 
gone by, "I've seen nothing that involves those people (Christ's Sons). I think 
their intent is very different. It's centered around their beliefs and the 
activities of that church." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Aguilar and other church members said that while bikers from other 
motorcycle groups or gangs might be wary when they see the Christ's Sons show 
up, they listen because fellow bikers are doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
Christ's Sons members said they have won bikers to their church, though they 
had no numbers on how many might have been swayed by the combination of black 
leather and silver crosses. 
</P>
<P>
"If I went around bikers with a suit on, I'd scare them, because they might 
think I'm a narc or something like that," said John Robinson, a 39-year-old who 
recently went to Texas to help run a ranch the church plans to operate as a 
detoxification facility for alcoholics and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people we win because of the clothes we have," Robinson said. "Sometimes 
we might scare people off a bit, but once they realize that we're Christians . 
. . they realize we're there representing the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
"Our bikes are nothing but an instrument," Robinson said. "Of course it's used 
to win more bikers. We let bikers know that 'hey, you don't have to be an 
outcast or some radical heathen in order to ride a motorcycle. You can be a 
born-again Christian and ride a motorcycle.' " 
</P>
<P>
In other words, you can be someone like Richard Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
A 52-year-old father of eight and grandfather of seven, Eaton retired his 
motorcycle when he and his wife started having children. "I didn't want to go 
down (crash) and not have anyone to take care of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his children were grown by the time he met a church member ready to sell a 
Kawasaki. "She needed some money and I had a bunch of cash in the closet and I 
liked what I saw, so I told my wife, 'I'm getting on my bike again.' " Eaton 
later traded up to a Suzuki and then to a Harley. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton called the church "a second family." Members of other churches probably 
would "get a little schizo" at the appearance of the congregation, he said, 
"but here at Set Free, they look at the inside, not what you look like. They 
don't care how you dress, what you look like or anything else. That's why 
everyone's so comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
Eaton said he rides a motorcycle "because it's, first of all, very enjoyable. 
You're not part of a herd. It's sort of like a cowboy and his horse kind of 
thing. You're doing your own thing and you have no strings attached, no sitting 
in the parking lot on a freeway; you just go through (traffic)." Plus, "I like 
the feel of the power." 
</P>
<P>
But he almost got off his bike for good in August, when on a Christ's Sons run 
northward his 19-year-old son, David, and another Christ's Sons member on a 
motorcycle were hit by a car driven by a motorist that Eaton said was drag 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
One youth was in a coma for three weeks; David Eaton had part of his leg 
amputated. Richard Eaton said that judging from the accident scene, both young 
men should have been dead. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting at the hospital, Richard Eaton said he asked the Lord, "Do you want me 
to get off my bike?" He said the answer was no. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton figured that the answer stemmed from the club's work to bring people to

"She remembered!" 
</P>
<P>
Orangewood is what First Lady Barbara Bush remembered on Wednesday during the 
dinner honoring Team 100 -- donors of $100,000 to the Bush campaign -- at the 
White House. "She is just incredible," said developer Kathryn Thompson Owen, 
who gave Barbara Bush a tour of the Orangewood home for abused children last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Owen, attending the fest for about 300 with her husband, Gus, was among five 
Orange County developers -- including Donald Bren, William Lyon, George Argyros 
and Jim Baldwin -- who dined on chicken fricasee, beef tenderloin, apple tart 
and pumpkin mousse in the flower-filled East Room. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bushes are absolutely wonderful," said Owen, who wore a pearl-studded 
black silk chiffon by Galanos to the affair. "She is just the warmest human 
being I think I've ever met. She walks in and says: 'Here I am! Hello 
everybody, my friends! 
</P>
<P>
"Then, at dinner, she spoke before the President spoke, and when she introduced 
him she went: 'dooooo do dooooo!' -- created a little fanfare. She is 
absolutely darling." 
</P>
<P>
Before dinner, the mega-donors enjoyed a cocktail reception at the home of 
social cyclone Georgette Mosbacher and her husband, Secretary of Commerce 
Robert Mosbacher. "Their house is beautiful," said Thompson, who noted 
Georgette -- an international fashion trendsetter -- wore a chic black suit 
with vivid pink and lemon lapels (and a huge lemon enamel pin shot with 
diamonds). 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween night, Team 100 partied at the home of Vice President Dan Quayle 
and his wife, Marilyn. "The house was decorated beautifully," said Willa Dean 
Lyon (who wore a smashing black velvet and lace dress by Oscar de la Renta to 
the White House). "Gorgeous flower arrangements and lots of pumpkins. The 
youngest Quayle children were all set to go trick or treating, and, when we 
left, a busload of children pulled up to visit the Quayles. The Quayles had 
invited them, but the Secret Service looked uneasy." 
</P>
<P>
William Lyon called the chance to dine at the White House "a special 
opportunity to be part of history. The White House is a wonderful, exciting 
place, a place for everyone, not just for a chosen few." 
</P>
<P>
Did he invite the President to visit him at his white home in Coto de Caza? 
"No, but he'll be out there sometime," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions, decisions: It's been a socialite's dream -- the chance to sweep into 
New York's Plaza Hotel to attend an uppity ball chaired by society queen Ivana 
Trump and the chance to soar off to Saudi Arabia to be wined and dined by 
royalty. Such has been life in the faster-than-the-speed-of-sound lane for Lois 
Aldrin, wife of former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, recently. But there was one 
little hitch: "I don't know what to pack!" Lois wailed earlier this week. "All 
of my formal dresses are a little see-through, and the Saudi prince (Prince 
Sultan Bin Salman al-Saud) has told me I must be covered, be opaque from head 
to toe! Oh, I'll figure out something." 
</P>
<P>
Before the ball at the Plaza on Thursday, the Aldrins popped by Malcolm Forbes' 
New York office to present him with an autographed copy of Buzz's new book, 
"Men From Earth." ("I'd sure like to get on his party list!" Lois piped.) 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Aldrins convened with pals aboard John Crean's yacht at 
the Balboa Bay Club to film a segment of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." 
</P>
<P>
"I told them," Lois said, "we may be famous, but we're only trying to get 
rich!" 
</P>
<P>
Start spreadin' the news: "Ruta Lee said it all at the Thalians Ball in Los 
Angeles last week," said Fortune 500 entrepreneur John Crean on Monday. "Wealth 
is like manure. It doesn't do any good unless you spread it around!" Crean is 
spreading it around, all right. His and wife Donna's donations in theater-arts 
circles are legend. And so is the 45,000-square-foot, Tara-esque compound 
they're building in Santa Ana Heights. You see, the Creans plan to live in but 
1,800 square feet of it. The rest is strictly for family and friends. Which 
brings us to our point: The Creans have decided to formally open their manse 
next spring to benefit a charity. "But we don't know which charity yet," John 
said. "We've received sooooo many requests." Meanwhile, the couple will move 
into their new digs in time to celebrate Christmas. And there's talk that Buddy 
Ebsen, Donald O'Connor and George Murphy will show up to christen their 
polished maple dance floor soon. 
</P>
<P>
Morsels: Hamburger mogul Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.) and his wife, Margaret, 
returned Tuesday night from a whirlwind Roman holiday with Forbes 400 developer 
Don Koll and his wife, Dorothy. The highlight of the trip, arranged by 
Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles: attending a Mass celebrated by Pope 
John Paul II in his private chapel. On Nov.11, the Karchers will celebrate 
their 50th wedding anniversary with family and friends in their Anaheim home. 
On Nov. 17, the couple plan to fly to Cabo San Lucas -- where the Karchers are 
building an 8,000-square-foot dream pad (they purchased the property from Koll) 
-- to spend Thanksgiving with their family at the Palmilla Hotel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Actor William Devane of television's "Knots Landing" will be best man Saturday 
when Arabian horse broker Phil Hatfield marries Christine Pavlo at Moss Point, 
the lush Laguna Beach estate once visited by President Woodrow Wilson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They want me back!" says socialite Suzanne Pierce, who appeared recently as an 
"atmosphere person" on an episode of television's "Golden Girls." Pierce, who 
lives in Newport Beach, won the chance to appear on the popular sitcom at a 
charity auction last year. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Pierce has been in New York, kicking up her heels at Hotel Pierre 
(where, incidentally, billionaire Don Bren and his step-mum, Claire Trevor, 
have apartments). Pierce sure knows how to get there: For her flight to New 
York, she boarded the equipped-to-the-nines Boeing 727 owned by MGM. "The MGM 
plane is heavenly," Pierce said. "I always take it to New York. It has fat 
swivel chairs, food served on tables, carpeting, indirect lighting, 
compartments for sleeping, a beautiful bar, cooked-to-order food, two baths -- 
one a huge powder room." The price tag? "Nineteen-hundred-and-something round 
trip," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce zipped back from the Big Apple on Wednesday so she could attend a 
birthday bash held Thursday for Kitty Kobrin at Carmelo's Italian bistro in 
Corona del Mar. Among those helping Kitty blow out the candles on her birthday 
cake: hubby Jerry, and nears and dears Pilar Wayne, Jolene and Tom Fuentes, 
Carolyn and Vick Knight, and the restaurant's owner and namesake, Carmelo 
Manto, and his wife, Judi.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for September.

MALLARD 
</P>
<P>
(Anas platyrhynchos) 
</P>
<P>
Description: The male is readily identified by metallic green head and neck, 
yellow bill and narrow white collar, with chestnut-colored breast; black 
central tail feathers curl up. Both sexes have white tail, white underwings, 
bright blue speculum with both sides bordered in white. Females have orange 
bill with black markings. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Can be found in shallow ponds, lakes, marshes and flooded fields. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Seeds and shoots of sedge, grass and aquatic vegetation, grain, acorns, 
insects and aquatic inverts. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Displays are frequent, but subtle and brief. Males swim with heads 
and tails shaking, with breast clear of water with necks outstretched. They 
also raise their wingtips, heads and tails briefly. Females often incite 
displays to provoke males to attack other males or females. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually near water; of cattails, reeds, grass, concealed by vegetation. 
Most nest on ground. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Females usually lay eight to 10 dull yellow or greenish eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Mallards are seasonally monogamous, switching mates each 
year. Male territorial defense is centered on female. Male deserts after first 
week of incubation to join male flocks. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society member Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.

Photo, Tall Tales Some of the children showed up in their pajamas, but it 
didn't turn out to be the kind of story hour that would put anyone to sleep. 
Carolyn Steidinger brought her tales to life with a variety of puppets that 
delighted the youngsters in her audience at Fullerton Public Library. 
Steidinger doesn't stand behind a puppet stage. Instead, she brings her 
colorful characters close to the audience to encourage the children to 
interact. Above, Steidinger and Pete the Pelican, who only eats things that 
begin with the letter P, entertain the children. At left, Marc Whipple, 5,

Biltmore measures -- An Oct. 27 story about the Biltmore Hotel ballot measures 
in the Hermosa Beach city election described the area that would be zoned open 
space under Proposition C as three blocks long. However, the open space area 
would be one block long, from 14th to 15th streets, while the remaining 
property adjacent to the Biltmore site would be zoned for restricted commercial

Herald Examiner -- A Times story Thursday on the legacy of the Los Angeles 
Herald Examiner incorrectly reported that a Herald editor sang the lyrics from 
the 1977 tune "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue?" to Louella Parsons after the 
Hollywood columnist once mixed up the eye color of an actress. The lyrics 
actually came from the 1925 song "Brown Eyes -- Why Are You Blue?"

An Assembly committee today speedily approved a quarter-cent sales tax increase 
to finance the state's share of earthquake relief efforts, as lawmakers 
convened in the Capitol in a special legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee approved the bill by Assemblyman 
Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) which would raise about $800 million from the 
13-month tax increase beginning Dec. 1. The bill was sent to the Ways and Means 
Committee on a 7-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, along with a dozen other panels from both houses, met in the 
Capitol in an atmosphere of confusion as lawmakers scrambled from hearing to 
hearing and considered hastily introduced bills.

BUSH STUMPS FOR GOP IN VIRGINIA, N.J.

<P>
President Bush, stumping today for underdog GOP candidates for governor in 
Virginia and New Jersey, talked of everything but abortion, the lightning-rod 
issue in those and other off-year contests. 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of campaign appearances for Republican J. Marshall Coleman, who 
trails Democrat Douglas Wilder -- who would be the nation's first elected black 
governor -- Bush sounded themes familiar from his own presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He said Coleman would be the state's best hope in dealing with crime, drugs, 
taxation, environment, education and a strong military. He even dusted off an 
issue that mired his 1988 campaign in controversy -- prison parole procedures. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the President campaigned on those issues, the divisive abortion 
question promised to figure in voters' calculations at the polls on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit came a day after an anti-abortion group accused four TV stations 
of refusing to air its pro-Coleman ads. Also on Thursday, Wilder was confronted 
by angry hecklers who called him a "baby killer" for his pro-choice stand on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion question also figured as an issue in the New Jersey governor's 
contest. Bush was heading there later today to try to boost Republican Rep. Jim 
Courter's long odds against Democratic Rep. James J. Florio. 
</P>
<P>
In Richmond, Bush called Coleman "the right man to lead Virginia in the battle 
against drug abuse. The war on drugs isn't a war of words. Anyone can talk 
tough -- but talking tough doesn't keep dealers off the street." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Norfolk, Bush said Coleman "understands that the Old Dominion 
doesn't need old ideas -- like the liberal creed which blames everyone except 
the criminal." 
</P>
<P>
"He wants the end of a hit-or-miss parole system that lets hardened drug 
dealers prey on society," Bush said.

U.S. REJECTS PLEA TO MEND ITS TIES WITH NEW ZEALAND; 
</P>
<P>
OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR ARMS CITED 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, reaffirming the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence, 
rebuffed an Australian call for a resumption of close political and military 
ties with New Zealand, senior officials of both countries said today. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it is time for Washington to 
consider repairing the relationship with New Zealand that was downgraded two 
years ago after the Wellington government refused to permit nuclear armed or 
nuclear-powered U.S. warships to call at New Zealand ports, an Australian 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
replied that nuclear deterrence remains a key element in U.S. policy despite 
the recent relaxation of superpower tensions. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Bush Administration official said the breach was caused by New 
Zealand's anti-nuclear policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They made the decision on this issue," the U.S. official said. "They will have 
to live with the result." 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's new prime minister, Jeffrey Palmer, has reaffirmed his nation's 
anti-nuclear policy. But he complained that President Bush is prepared to meet 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev while retaining a policy that prohibits 
high-level political and military contacts with New Zealand, one of 
Washington's oldest traditional allies. 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. official said, "We live in an age where the United States plays an 
important role in terms of deterrent capabilities around the globe. Those in 
part depend on our ability to project force with our Navy. Our Navy relies in 
part on nuclear propulsion as well as nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.S. government has expressed concern that a growing worldwide 
abhorrence of nuclear weapons might upset the global military balance which, 
officials argue, has prevented a new world war for almost 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement over New Zealand, combined with a somewhat similar rift over 
Washington's continued coolness toward an Australian-backed South Pacific 
Nuclear Free Zone, marred otherwise harmonious U.S.-Australia security talks at 
a naval base in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, Cheney, Evans and Australian Defense Minister Kim Beazley attended the 
annual meeting to set policy for the alliance, which is still known as ANZUS 
(for Australia, New Zealand and the United States) despite New Zealand's 
suspension in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Australian officials said they gained "the very strong impression" that the 
United States will abstain from a U.N. General Assembly vote endorsing the 
recently signed compact that prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons in the 
South Pacific although it does not ban the passage through the region of 
nuclear-armed ships flying the flag of an outside nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it," one Australian official said of a U.S. abstention in the United 
Nations. "We like it a lot more than if they voted no." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said, however, that no decision has been made concerning 
Washington's position on the U.N. vote. But they left little doubt that the 
United States opposes creation of nuclear-free zones anywhere in the world.

An elephant entering her third year of pregnancy apparently has set a world's 
record for a pachyderm gestation, but doubts are growing about the health of 
the 200-pound fetus, anxious zookeepers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jean, a 19-year-old Asian elephant at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, was due 
to give birth to her first calf in August, after what would have been a normal 
22-month pregnancy, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 days later, the 2 1/2-ton pachyderm is showing no signs of labor and 
park officials have little hope of a healthy birth, Hanscom said. "At this 
point, we doubt there is a live fetus."

The Canadian government unveiled an abortion law today that allows a woman to 
end her pregnancy at any time if a doctor believes her life or health is 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited legislation will fill the void created when Canada's Supreme 
Court struck down a more restrictive law last year but will end what has become 
a practice of abortion on demand that resulted from the lack of an abortion 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government had promised new legislation since 
the previous law was declared unconstitutional in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill introduced today establishes that the question of abortion is a 
medical decision to be made between a woman and her doctor, based on health 
grounds," Justice Minister Doug Lewis told reporters.

French President Francois Mitterrand, ending talks here with West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today, said he is not afraid of a reunified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a two-day meeting that concentrated on the rapid 
changes under way in Eastern Europe, Mitterrand described the question of 
German reunification as a dominant issue in Europe at the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not afraid of reunification," Mitterrand said. "I think the desire for 
reunification is legitimate for the Germans. What counts above all is the 
determination and will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he thought there would be real self-determination for people in both 
German states, Mitterrand said he would be surprised if there was not some 
movement in the next 10 years.

BUSH TO BACK CONGRESS MOVE TO HIKE ITS PAY

The White House today said President Bush will support a new attempt on Capitol 
Hill to get a pay increase for members of Congress, federal officials and 
judges who saw a 51% pay hike go down in flames earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting for them to give us a package," press secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said. "We'll be supportive if the Congress produces any reasonable 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush would like to see any raise tied to a package of ethical 
standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honorariums -- fees for 
speeches, public appearances and writing. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) met with Bush on Wednesday to discuss pay hikes, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley and Michel both back a raise proposal, made by a bipartisan task force, 
that would phase in a 35% salary boost over two years, according to 
congressional aides. The plan would also include changes in Congress' ethics 
rules, including new restrictions on members' speaking honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic leadership aide said today that "no final decision has been made" 
on moving a pay increase this year, but the meeting with Bush was sought 
because "presidential support would be essential" if lawmakers go ahead with a 
salary plan. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't leave the implication the package is finished and agreed to," said 
the aide.

A public uproar caused Congress earlier this year to kill a pay proposal that 
would have raised salaries by 51%. 
</P>
<P>
A House task force has suggested a 10% increase in 1990 and the rest of the 
raise following the year after. That would give congressmen a salary of about 
$127,000 a year.

Supporters of abortion rights announced plans today for 1,000 demonstrations in 
150 cities Nov. 12, which will begin with a "thousand points of light" sunrise 
service near President Bush's vacation home and be highlighted by a massive 
rally at the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most single ambitious human rights activity ever taken in the 
United States," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, 
told a news conference held to publicize the event. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before have so many groups come and converged on so many points yet also 
had a massive demonstration, which we think will hit record proportions in 
Washington itself," Smeal said. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, which organized the coalition of groups staging the protests, said the 
events would kick off a campaign to elect state legislators in 1990 favoring a 
woman's right to choose an abortion.

Vanessa Vadim, the daughter of actress Jane Fonda and French director Roger 
Vadim, agreed today to three days of community service in exchange for the 
dismissal of misdemeanor charges stemming from her arrest near a building known 
for its drug location. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim, 21, a student at Brown University in Providence, R.I., rushed smiling 
from the courtroom in the glare of television cameras after the ruling, 
refusing to answer questions shouted by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
She clutched the hand of her sister, Natalie Vadim. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim was arrested Oct. 6 on Manhattan's Lower East Side when police nabbed her 
and Thomas Feegal, 22, as he allegedly passed heroin to another man. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim may complete her community service at a hospital either in New York or 
Rhode Island, law enforcement sources said.

CONISTON PARTNERS TO SEEK CONTROL OF UAL CORP.'S BOARD 
</P>

<P>
The New York buyout firm Coniston Partners, which two years ago forced a 
restructuring of the parent of United Airlines, said today it plans to seek 
control of UAL Corp.'s board. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston partner Paul Tierney said the group, through a vehicle called Condor 
Partners LP, has made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
stating that it has spent roughly $333 million in recent months amassing 2.1 
million UAL common shares, representing 9.7% of the total outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to seek control of the board," Tierney told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
With control of the board, Coniston would be able to steer the company toward a 
sale, restructuring or recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
The statement followed rumors on Wall Street this week that an investor might 
try to force the company's board to boost the price of UAL shares. The stock 
has dropped sharply since the pilots and management failed last month in a 
$6.75-billion takeover bid for the parent of the nation's second-largest 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
UAL declined to comment on the Coniston statement. 
</P>
<P>
UAL stock rose sharply on the news and traded at $183.50 at midday, up $10.50 a 
share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The stock had traded as high as $294 in September after the company's board 
agreed to the employee-management group's $300-a-share bid, but skidded to 
around $145 after the effort fell apart last month. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston said it would seek to remove all current UAL directors except Frank 
Olson, chairman of Hertz, and UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf. It said its nominees 
to the board are Keith Gollust, Augustus Oliver and Tierney, the principal 
partners of the New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
It said that if elected, its board members would seek to push up the value of 
UAL stock. This is normally done through a sale of all or part of a company or 
a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"If elected, Condor's nominees will seek to execute a transaction that 
maximizes value for stockholders, provides job security and, if desired, an 
opportunity for equity ownership for unionized and non-unionized employees, and 
provides the company with a stable base for long-term growth," the group said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders said the disclosure puts tremendous pressure on the UAL 
board. "If the vote were held today, Coniston would be a landslide winner," one 
trader said. He added, "there is no chance of the board's beating Coniston 
without some alternative." 
</P>
<P>
"The board has to respond fast. All Coniston needs is signatures for 51% of the 
shareholders and it's over," said another trader. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston is believed to have held a stake in the company since 1987, when the 
partnership was instrumental in forcing a restructuring of Allegis Corp., the 
former parent of United that also owned hotels and Hertz, the rental car 
company.

China announced today the discovery of a new oil field in a remote western 
desert region, calling it a "major breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily said the first well to produce oil in the center of the 
Tarim basin in Xinjiang yielded 576 cubic meters of light high-grade oil and 
360,000 cubic meters of gas Tuesday, its first day of production. 
</P>
<P>
One European oil company official said that oil is already being produced from 
the north of the Tarim but that this would be the first find in the center of 
the 210,000-square-mile basin. He said it will take much more work to know how 
large the total reserves are. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the arid region can exceed 150 in the summer.

Foreign sanctions imposed on South Africa have cost the country 500,000 jobs 
and billions of dollars since 1985, a leading economist said. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Chris van Wyk, chief executive of the Bankorp banking group, also 
said foreign investment and trade bans have hurt blacks the most. "The harshest 
burden of sanctions has fallen on them," he said, adding that 80% of new 
job-seekers are black. 
</P>
<P>
The study said sanctions and the pullout of foreign investment since 1985 cost 
$16 billion in foreign exchange, resulting in production losses of about $32 
billion and total spending loss of about $45 billion, based on the average 
value of the country's currency, the rand, during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sanctions, South Africa's economy still is considered the strongest 
and most diversified on the continent.

2-HOUR DELAY IN 911 RESPONSE INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officials Thursday were investigating what was apparently a nearly 
two-hour delay in responding to a 911 call from a Brentwood restaurant manager 
who was reporting the robbery of a customer. 
</P>
<P>
Although the manager of the Hamburger Hamlet on San Vicente Boulevard maintains 
that he called 911 three times -- including one call during the Wednesday night 
robbery -- officers were not notified and dispatched to the restaurant until 
almost two hours later, long after the suspect had fled with the victim's 
watch, which reportedly was worth $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Hall, commanding officer of detectives at LAPD's West Los Angeles 
Division, admitted that a faster response might have resulted in the arrest of 
the robber, who was briefly detained by other restaurant customers after the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to determine how many calls were made, what the subject of each 
call was and why there was not a sooner response," said Los Angeles Police 
Cmdr. William Booth, who added that investigators are combing through phone 
records and interviewing police detectives to find out what happened. "It 
certainly appears that the call we responded to was not the first call." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials did not wish to speculate on what may have caused the delay 
although police Sgt. Rick Walker suggested that information typed into the 911 
computer by the dispatcher who took the initial call may have been accidentally 
erased. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, a 911 dispatcher receives a call at the Police Department's 
Communications Division, inputs information from the caller into a computer and 
requests a unit response either by radio or through the computer, according to 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 7:15 p.m. The robbery victim, Juran Miklas, 41, had 
agreed to meet the suspect at the restaurant after the suspect, responding to a 
newspaper ad, expressed interest in buying Miklas' watch. 
</P>
<P>
After Miklas gave the suspect the watch so that he could get a closer look at 
it, Hall said, "the suspect stuck a stun gun in the face of the victim. ... He 
apparently hit him with it too, causing him to fall out of his chair and hit 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
At least two customers grabbed the suspect, and the manager said he quickly 
dialed 911 and told them he needed police help. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was able to break free within the next few minutes and fled, along 
with the woman who had accompanied him. Thirty minutes later, police still had 
not arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I called 911 again, was put on hold and then disconnected," the manager said. 
"I called again and was put on hold for five minutes, then I said, 'The hell 
with this. I'm calling the West Los Angeles Police Department."' 
</P>
<P>
Police received a call at 8:52, and officers arrived at the restaurant shortly 
after 9 p.m., Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Miklas was treated at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center for cuts to his face and 
right hand and released.
