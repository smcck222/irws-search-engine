WHAT WORKING CLASS?; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: TO LOOK AT OUR NEWS MEDIA, YOU'D NEVER KNOW AMERICA STILL HAS A 
BLUE-COLLAR MAJORITY. THIS INVISIBILITY LEADS TO PREJUDICE AND HURTS US ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA EHRENREICH, Barbara Ehrenreich's latest book is Fear of Falling: the 
Inner Life of the Middle Class (Pantheon). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may not have noticed it, but American coal miners have, for more than six 
months, waged one of the largest and most dramatic strikes in recent history. 
That's right, American miners. But their strike has been so thoroughly buried 
by the media that it's possible for even a diligent news-watcher to believe 
that only the Soviet Union -- or Poland -- still has an assertive working 
class. 
</P>
<P>
America's working-class majority has never received publicity in proportion to 
its numbers. It enjoyed a brief modishness following its "discovery" by the 
media in 1969. This discovery was in many ways parallel to the "discovery" of 
poverty six years earlier: A previously invisible group was unveiled, with 
great fanfare, on the covers of the national newsmagazines, examined in 
television specials and seized upon by academics. For a few years at least, the 
working class enjoyed the attention of Hollywood ("The Deer Hunter," "Blue 
Collar") and of journalists and academics who produced dozens of books and 
articles on the "neglected majority." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the 1980s, the working class dropped from sight. Hollywood lost 
interest, and on television, aside from "Roseanne" and "Married, With 
Children," there is almost nothing to remind us that not every family is 
supported by a doctor-lawyer team. In the newspapers, there has been a steady 
decline of labor coverage, leaving the labor reporting that does go on 
increasingly in the hands of the business section. In academia, as a professor 
friend reports to me, "class is out of style." 
</P>
<P>
So it is possible for a middle-class person today to read the papers, watch 
television, even go to college without suspecting that America has any 
inhabitants other than white-collar professionals and, of course, the 
thoroughly demonized "black underclass." 
</P>
<P>
The producers of public-affairs talk shows do not blush to serve up four 
upper-income professionals to ponder the minimum wage or the need for a 
national health program. Working-class people are likely to cross the screen 
only as witnesses to crimes or sports events, never as commentators or -- even 
when their own lives are under discussion -- as "experts." 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the working class reflects the longstanding cultural 
insularity of the professional middle class. Why did the working class, or the 
poor, have to be "discovered" in the first place? From whose vantage point were 
they missing? If anything, the natural solipsism of the professional middle 
class has increased with the class-polarizing trends of the '80s. Compared to, 
say, a decade ago, the classes are less likely to mix in college (due to the 
decline of financial aid), in traditional residential neighborhoods (as 
speculation drives the working class out to new towns far on the fringe) or 
even in the malls (with the accelerating segmentation of the retail industry 
into upscale and downscale components). 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of real contact or communication, prejudices easily substitute 
for knowledge. The most intractable stereotype is of the white working class as 
a collection of reactionaries and bigots -- "hard-hats" or "Archie Bunker 
types." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the working class is far more reliably liberal than the 
professional middle class. It was more, not less, opposed to the war in 
Vietnam. It is more, not less, disposed to vote for a Democrat for President. 
Also, in decrying the racism of blue-collar whites -- as in Bensonhurst or 
Howard Beach -- we should not forget the recent epidemic of campus racism by 
thoroughly affluent whites. 
</P>
<P>
Even deeper than the stereotype of the hard-hat bigot lies the middle-class 
suspicion that the working class is dumb, inarticulate and mindlessly loyal to 
archaic values. In the entertainment media, for example, the working class is 
usually a setting for macho exhibitionism (from "Saturday Night Fever" to, in 
cameo, "Working Girl") or mental impairment (as in "Married, With Children"). 
Sociologists have reinforced this prejudice with theories of working-class 
"parochialism" and "authoritarianism." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a level of prejudice that is usually disguised as a matter of 
taste. In middle-class stereotypes, the white working class, for example, is 
addicted to cigarettes, Budweiser, polyester and network television. 
Furthermore, in the middle-class view, polyester is "tacky" -- a common code 
word for "lower class." Health concerns, plus a certain reverence for the 
"natural" in matters of food and fiber, infuse these middle-class prejudices 
with a high-minded tone of moral indignation. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class prejudices are real and hurtful to working-class Americans. But 
they also add to the parochialism of the professional middle class itself, 
which is increasingly isolated in its own social and residential enclaves, 
condemned to hear only the opinions of its own members (or, of course, of the 
truly rich), and cut off from the lives and insights of the American majority.

HE TURNED NEW JERSEY AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can one person still make a difference? You bet. Consider Thomas H. Kean and 
New Jersey, for example. When Kean was first elected governor eight years ago, 
New Jersey was one of the nation's most maligned states, and perhaps with some 
reason. Always overshadowed by neighboring New York and Pennsylvania, the 
Garden State was viewed as anything but garden-like. It was a place known 
mostly for political corruption, urban decay, toxic dumps and such tourist 
highlights as the rest stops on the New Jersey Turnpike, named for famed New 
Jersey natives like Clara Barton and Grover Cleveland. The state did not even 
have its own VHF television station. 
</P>
<P>
One man cannot take credit for all of New Jersey's impressive economic, social 
and cultural renaissance. Some of the work was begun by Kean's predecessor, 
Brendan Byrne. But New Jersey has come into full bloom in the past eight years 
and much of the image change can be credited to the energy of the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Republican has mixed free market economic policies with 
moderate to liberal social positions on subjects that include the environment 
and public education to be an effective and popular leader. His appeal 
attracted considerable numbers of black votes, and he has given the Republican 
Party real status in New Jersey. It's been a long time since we heard New 
Jerseyites apologize when they explain where they are from. 
</P>
<P>
The Almanac of American Politics says Kean has been New Jersey's most popular 
governor since his ancestor William Livingston was elected in 1776. But New 
Jersey is one of the few states that limits governors to two terms. Kean could 
not run for reelection if he wanted to, and aides claim he didn't want to 
anyway. Nor has he considered challenging the popular Bill Bradley, the 
Democratic U.S. senator whose seat is up in 1990. Kean will be succeeded by the 
winner of the Nov. 7 election, either Democratic Rep. James J. Florio or 
Republican Rep. Jim Courter. 
</P>
<P>
When he leaves his Trenton office next Jan. 16, Kean will become president of 
Drew University, a small liberal arts institution in Madison, N.J. And don't be 
surprised to be hearing from Drew University in the future.

A TOUCH OF CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush showed rare political class when he abandoned his campaign for a 
cut in the capital gains tax, something he wanted very much, in order to keep 
the federal government solvent, something everybody else wanted very much. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the tax is imposed on profits from the sale of stock, homes and 
other assets at the same rate as ordinary income. Bush originally wanted to cut 
it by about half. But as we see it, he did not lose much by deciding to wait 
until next year. The capital gains bill had been politicized to the point where 
it would have amounted to nothing more than a two-year tax amnesty for wealthy 
Americans. It needed work, and Bush's move makes time for more careful study of 
the tax cut as a way to encourage productive investment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made it clear that he still hopes to get the reduction he promised during 
last year's campaign, but it seems clear he did not think that getting it this 
year was important enough to prolong a fight over the tax that has stopped 
every important piece of legislation in its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stalled bills alone made it worth Bush's while to call off the 
fight. It raises the ceiling on the national debt. If it does not clear 
Congress by next week, the federal government would have to start defaulting on 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The move also frees Bush to concentrate on lashing the Democratic leadership in 
both the House and Senate to produce budgets that meet the targets set by the 
Gramm-Rudman act for reducing the federal deficit. He may not get his tax cut 
this year, but the the move is bound to lead to a capital gain of his own.

SCHOOLS FAIL, NOT OUR CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PUBLIC CLASSROOMS ARE A MONSTROUS BOONDOGGLE, SEPARATING PARENTS 
FROM THE EDUCATION OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN. BIG BROTHER WOULD BE PROUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GEHL, Robert Gehl, of Sacramento, plans to be a candidate for state 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public, government-controlled education is a troubled and all but moribund 
system that, in the private sector, would have been bankrupt and out of 
business long ago. Its effect on everyone involved is parallel to the classic 
stages of mourning, defined so well by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross: Denial, Anger, 
Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators, superintendents, principals and all those within the 
schools who make excellent salaries outside the classrooms are firmly in the 
Denial stage. For them the system works, the status quo is fine, and all that 
is needed is more money, always more money, and a higher caliber of teachers 
and parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kids 10 and older, smarter than adults, recognize that "compulsory education" 
is an oxymoronic idea; they move from an unconscious Denial during the fifth 
grade to a semiconscious Anger in the sixth and seventh, rejecting a government 
(grown-ups) that forces them to the water and insists that they drink. The 
administrators react by dropping both academic and behavioral standards 
surprisingly close to zero. The kids, realizing that they're being warehoused, 
meander through the latter stages of mourning, to Bargaining, to Depression and 
to Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Anger is the condition of the few knowledgeable taxpayers who are aware that it 
costs more than $150,000 per year to keep 30 kids sitting in a 
government-operated first grade. Those parents scheming to get their kid 
transferred to a "better" school are Bargainers, as are those who take flight 
to a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, when new, Accept everything, including the powerlessness of the 
classroom instructor who dares not give more than a handful of low grades and 
who isn't trusted to dismiss any kid who is disrupting the education of others. 
They do not realize that their low status is necessary to the higher salaries 
and status of the non-teaching people. Their initial Acceptance turns to almost 
simultaneous Denial and Depression, usually seen as burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Government (public) schools in America are a mournful, socialized failure. 
Everyone who wants more from them than "free" child care knows this. Among all 
the industrialized nations our kids come in dead last in just about any test or 
comparison. As 30% of our precious raw material is wasted and "dropped out," 
many of the remainder are given counterfeit diplomas with no guarantee that 
they have mastered the essential skills or developed the proper values to make 
this nation competitive in the world or us safe in our own streets. We are, as 
we dolefully agree, a nation at risk. How come? 
</P>
<P>
We have collectivized our schools, just as the Soviet Union collectivized 
farms, and the results have been equally disastrous: mismanagement and waste, 
disaffection and dehumanization. Ralph Waldo Emerson said that nothing great 
was ever accomplished without enthusiasm. In my 30 years of public school 
teaching, I sensed that the only real enthusiasm came from the inevitable 
"blue-ribbon" commissions set up year after year to meet "the crisis in 
education." With enthusiasm, but also with a hopelessly naive arrogance and 
conceit, they always imagined that they could plan the use of educational 
resources better than the millions of individuals who actually provided the 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Soviets, who didn't trust the farmers to make their own decisions and 
control their own lives, our public school lobby convinced government that 
education was too important to be left to the people, that the people did not 
really want to trust themselves with the education of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"Self-trust is the essence of heroism," quoting Emerson again. But we the 
people, not being heroic enough, have acquiesced in probably the most 
monumental boondoggle that could befall us. We have education by civil servants 
and curriculum planning by career bureaucrats who preach hypocritical cant 
equating government thought-control with national unity, equal opportunity and 
"the American Way." They have forced us to think of education in terms that Big 
Brother would approve. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson's famous line is rarely quoted in its entirety: "That government is 
best which governs least, because the people discipline themselves." When 
government gets involved with minds and controls how, what, why and where its 
citizens think, it is governing not least but most, not best but worst, and it 
is robbing those citizens of the will to discipline themselves and the trust 
they would have in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In a brave and freedom-loving society, government ideally would get out of the 
mind-altering business, limiting itself to welfare-type "education stamps" for 
the poor. The rest of the citizens, relieved of most of the education taxes 
that they now pay to government middlemen, would happily contract for 
educational services, becoming personally involved to a far greater degree than 
is possible today. 
</P>
<P>
Other solutions of honesty and merit are tuition tax credits or a simple 
voucher system, both of which recognize that the schools will never improve 
until the public school monopoly is broken and all schools can compete on an 
equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
For government to "relieve" parents of the responsibility for education is to 
do great injury to the familial relationship, depriving parent and child of the 
sense of bonding and mutual appreciation that is the deepest principle of human 
existence and the ultimate form of self-esteem. The breaking of this bond, I am 
convinced, has done incalculable harm to the American nation.

RONALD REAGAN'S $2-MILLION SPEAKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial on the travesty of Ronald Reagan hiring himself out for PR work 
in Japan will, hopefully, call a halt to this tacky, tasteless behavior by our 
former President. The Japanese, and the rest of the world too, must be 
laughing, sniggering and chortling over this gambit, buying the President of 
the U.S., and for only $2 million! 
</P>
<P>
It highlights the avarice and the money-grubbing aspect of U.S. politics. We 
have no honor, no decency and everything is for sale -- the land, companies, 
the Congress, and now the former President. What must our uniformed servicemen 
and women think, seeing the spectacle of their former commander-in-chief doing 
day work for the Japanese empire. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan disgraces himself and our country with his hustling.

Zsa Zsa Gabor must go to jail for three days, pay $13,000 in fines, do 120 
hours of community service for a misdemeanor.

Oliver North was convicted of three felonies, walked away with a slap on the 
wrist, a small fine and 1,200 hours of public service. He too manipulated the 
legal process and remains unremorseful.

<P>
When the judge insists on psychiatric evaluation as part of the parole that was 
the final slap in the face for Miss Gabor. I do not condone Miss Gabor's

WORLD WAR II MINORITY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to applaud the effort to obtain justice on the part of Hayao 
Shishino and the other Japanese Americans from Los Angeles High School who were 
denied diplomas in 1942 (Part A, Oct. 25). It is shocking that they were 
prevented from graduating then, but no less sickening was the way that Japanese 
Americans in general were deprived of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
As a fellow alumnus (Los Angeles High, winter, 1943), I can recall the sorrow 
that many of us felt, some time after Pearl Harbor, when classmates and their 
families were being sent off to a camp for no other reason than that of ethnic 
prejudice, not felt, for example, toward Americans of German or Italian 
ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who were Jews (and we did know what was happening in Germany), were 
perhaps particularly sensitive to their plight, but felt helpless to do 
anything. I remember with great sadness the weeping of embarrassment of many of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, when I was invited to lecture in Japan, I was pleased to 
mention some of my classmates by name (Yuki Mishima, Kimiko Naruse, Ruby Okubo, 
Louise Yamazaki), in the land of their ancestry, and to ask their forgiveness 
for what my/our country had done to them. 
</P>
<P>
It is a source of satisfaction and healing for me to know that our government 
now recognizes our error and has agreed to rectify it. It is equally rewarding 
to see Shishino and the others standing up for their rights with both dignity 
and forbearance.

RONALD REAGAN'S $2-MILLION SPEAKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read that Ronald Reagan wants to return decency and morality to U.S. movies, 
and that he thinks Japanese movies are better than ours. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it interesting that he, of all people, would talk about "decency and 
morality." Isn't he the one who robbed the poor to cut taxes for the rich; who 
created a nation of homeless by cutting housing money by 90%; who reduced food 
programs and left us with 20 million hungry; who said homeless people like to 
sleep on grates in freezing weather; who forced the minimum wage to remain 
$3.35 all during his reign; who created a national debt and deficits so huge 
that we Americans must pay $600 million in interest alone, every day (much of 
which goes to Japan); who made it possible for cronies to milk HUD for 
millions; and who year after year poured billions into military expenditures 
while proclaiming that human needs problems can't be solved by "throwing money" 
at them; who kept 30% of our best engineers tied up producing military 
equipment so we couldn't compete in world markets; and who made sure that Japan 
always had the better deal on trade? You mean he's the one talking about 
"decency and morality"? You're kidding! 
</P>
<P>
After getting $2 million from Japan for his appearance there, and for all he 
did for them in Washington, he should star in a new movie called "Mr. Greed 
Goes to Tokyo." Think of the message on morality and decency our children would 
receive! 
</P>
<P>
Instead of milking the ex-presidency to the extent no other President has done, 
why doesn't he just look at the want ads and get a respectable job. That's what 
he always advised everyone else who was unemployed!

For those who think cops hiding behind mustaches and mirrored sunglasses, 
giving traffic tickets to commuters for minor infractions of questionable laws 
to fill city treasuries is the biggest racket of all . . .

For those who laugh upon hearing Judge Rubin piously reprimand Zsa Zsa Gabor 
for likening America's (and his) justice to the communists and Nazis -- and 
then deny her constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech by forbidding her 
to discuss his actions (the sentencing) with the press . . . 
</P>
<P>
For those who can see the difference between petty jealousy of Zsa Zsa Gabor 
and the real issue -- governmental money-making schemes in the name of law, 
propaganda and governmental incursion into our lives . . . 
</P>
<P>
For those of us, Miss Gabor's was far from "A slap in the face of all 
Americans;" it was more like the slap heard 'round the world.

ARTLESS REPORTING OF RAIDERS TOO MUCH

<P>
Well, here they go again, continuing the unfair, slanted reporting that many 
reporters seem to practice unconsciously. 
</P>
<P>
I found it absolutely impossible to believe that nowhere in either Mark 
Heisler's or Chris Baker's stories on the Raiders last Sunday was the name of 
Coach Art Shell. Not once. 
</P>

That's OK as long as they do the same next season after the Raiders lose five 
of their first six or seven games.

The only consistency that Coach Terry Donahue and his staff seem to have is 
their inconsistency. They fail to motivate their teams, fail to effectively 
alter game plans, and fail to win games when they are overwhelming favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for that field goal, which left the team vulnerable to a one-point 
loss, tells it all. Don't tell me about the seven straight bowl wins. Tell me 
about two straight USC losses, leading to losing the Rose Bowl bid.

Too bad "our" Giants couldn't do what "their" Giants did ("Yomiuri Giants Win

If our Giants feel bad, they should phone the Kintetsu Buffaloes and hear their

Once upon a time, UCLA had a good football team. They won three of four Rose 
Bowls, and seven straight bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
And with that success, Terry Donahue had the golden opportunity to recruit the 
nation's top players for future Bruin greatness. Today, those recruits are 
starting. I don't think Donahue knows what he's doing. He recruited five of the 
nation's top running backs. Please tell me what you need with five running 
backs? How about recruiting just one or two, and maybe some linemen to block 
for them!

<P>
Call me crazy, but I thought only one player at a time could carry the

Sour grapes? Stupidity? I guess it's a little of each. Jim Murray's column on

their coaches now to lose, so they won't have a bad impression of their 
schools? Come on. 
</P>
<P>
Give Notre Dame credit, they came back in the second half and beat a good USC 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Murray was rooting for USC. Better luck next time or maybe Notre

GRANADA HILLS RUNS DOWN KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How undermanned did Kennedy High appear to be as it headed into its intracity 
showdown with Granada Hills on Friday night? Consider the one-liner dispensed 
by Kennedy assistant coach Tom Sams, who looked down the sideline moments 
before the North Valley League game and noticed a particularly beefy Kennedy 
graduate: 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to get a uniform on," cracked Sams as he nodded toward Jeff Bregel, 
who now plays for the San Francisco 49ers and who had dropped by to watch his 
younger brother, Troy, against the undefeated Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, even the elder Bregel couldn't have helped much, since he was 
booted off the sidelines along with a mob of other former Kennedy players who 
saw Granada Hills defeat the Golden Cougars, 17-0, at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's win gave the Highlanders their best start of the decade. Granada Hills 
was also unbeaten after eight games in 1986, when the team started 7-0-1. The 
Highlanders (8-0, 5-0 in league play) will play host to San Fernando, also 
unbeaten in league play, next Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills moved the ball most effectively on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders rolled up 338 yards in offense, all but 71 on rushing plays on 
a blustery evening. The running game was especially effective in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Brett Washington gave Granada Hills a 7-0 lead with 5:49 left in the 
first quarter when he ran in untouched from 11 yards. Washington, who gained a 
game-high 176 yards in 23 carries, set up the score with a 12-yard burst. 
</P>
<P>
Backfield mate Leon Glasgow, who finished with 77 rushing yards, was next in 
the point parade, scoring from eight yards with 10:22 left in the half to give 
Granada Hills a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills quarterback Bryan Martin completed only one of seven passes in 
the half, although he was victimized three times by dropped balls. He didn't 
fare much better in the second half, completing just six of 21 for 71 yards -- 
with eight drops. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's offense was unable to establish itself, netting just 70 yards. The 
Golden Cougars (3-5, 2-3) fumbled the ball six times, losing it twice. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Ontiwaun Carter, who entered the game as the Northwest Valley 
Conference's leading rusher, was held to 55 yards in 12 carries. Granada Hills 
has yet to allow 100 yards to any ballcarrier.

RECRUITING INQUIRY CLEARS MONTCLAIR PREP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep was given a clean bill of health Friday after Southern Section 
officials had paid a surprise visit to the private school in Van Nuys to 
investigate the possibility of recruiting violations involving the school's 
football program and its undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, Southern Section administrators Bill Clark and Dean Crowley 
arrived at the campus Friday to investigate the living arrangements of Derek 
and Leland Sparks, cousins who had transferred to Montclair Prep this fall. 
Derek, from Banning High in Wilmington, is the Valley area's leading rusher. 
Leland, from El Campo, Tex., is the team's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The two players live in an apartment on campus with their uncle, Eric Sparks, 
and Donovan Roy and John Goldbaum, fellow juniors on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Had the players lived off campus in an apartment owned by the school that 
wasn't available to all students, the Southern Section could have invoked the 
anti-recruiting statute of the California Interscholastic Federation rules. 
That rule forbids schools from securing or retaining students through use of 
"undue influence." Providing special living arrangements for athletes would 
constitute undue influence. 
</P>
<P>
But because Montclair Prep is a licensed boarding school, the living 
arrangement of the four athletes satisfies Southern Section regulations. 
</P>
<P>
V. E. Simpson, the school's principal and founder, provided financial records 
that show the athletes pay rent for the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Sparks has been hired by the school as the boarding school supervisor, 
campus caretaker and an assistant coach with the football team, according to 
Crowley. The four football players are the school's only boarders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a legit deal," Crowley said. "They (Montclair Prep) didn't have anything 
to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of recruiting violations at the school had abounded since the start of 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section investigation of Montclair Prep is the second in the past 
four years. Crowley investigated the eligibility of eight athletes Oct. 7, 
1985, but no violations were found.

5 SCORES BY PEERY POWER CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school-record streak was snapped Friday night, but a different school record 
was established and a remarkable record grew even more lustrous. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High receiver Clint Beauer, who had caught a touchdown pass in each of 
the Cowboys' first eight games to set a school record, was shut out by 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Chris Peery picked up the slack, however, scoring a school-record five 
touchdowns to lead Canyon to a 42-6 Golden League victory over the Falcons at 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"He was major league tonight," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the Cowboys' 37th in their past 38 league games and secured at 
least a share of the league championship, Welch's seventh in eight seasons as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Peery, who gained only 21 yards in the first half, exploded for 118 in the 
second and finished with 139 in 20 carries. He scored on runs of 13, 18, 19, 
one and one yards. 
</P>
<P>
Beauer could have used just one of those touchdowns to keep his streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We sacrificed him the whole game," Welch said. "He didn't complain a bit. 
That's what kind of team player he is." 
</P>
<P>
Beauer caught just one pass, but he fell one yard short of the end zone when he 
hauled in a 47-yard pass from Chris Spahr on a fake punt. One official raised 
his arms, indicating a touchdown, but another marked the ball at the one. Peery 
scored on the next play for the Cowboys (5-3-1, 4-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale tailback LaShante Parker scored on a one-yard run in the first quarter 
to give the Falcons (3-6, 2-2) a short-lived 6-0 lead. Parker finished with 99 
yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon also won the passing battle. Quarterback Tim Beidle completed six of 11 
attempts for 104 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of Palmdale passers completed only seven of 39 for 102 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons outgained the Cowboys, 131-118, in the first half, but still 
trailed at the half, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale took the opening kickoff and marched 65 yards. Parker, who gained 70 
yards in the half, finished the drive with a one-yard run for the 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Falcons had to play defense, and it proved a chore. They were called 
for encroachment six times in the first half, including three times on Canyon's 
first drive. 
</P>
<P>
Peery returned the ensuing kickoff to the 50, then Palmdale defenders jumped 
early on three of the next six plays. Fullback David McDivitt eventually scored 
from 14 yards and Chris Wilson's point after gave the Cowboys a lead they would 
never relinquish.

Thousand Oaks 34, Warren 13 -- Thousand Oaks scored three unanswered touchdowns 
in the first quarter and cruised to an easy win at Warren (3-6) in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks quarterback Scott Peterson, who completed three of eight passes 
for 29 yards and threw one interception, scored on a 28-yard run. Tailback Mike 
Lindsay, who finished with 69 yards in 13 carries, ran 14 yards for a touchdown 
to give the Lancers a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A third-down quick kick by Warren's Rick DeLeon was blocked by Thousand Oaks 
(8-0-1) and recovered at the Warren two-yard line by Nick Ochoa. Cory Bowen, 
who rushed for 51 yards in seven carries, ran for the touchdown on the next 
play, the last of the first quarter, to make the score 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay ran 23 yards around the left side to give the Lancers a 27-6 lead after 
a blocked punt midway through the third quarter. ANDY MEYERS

ROSSELLI, ALEMANY RALLY TO DEFEAT ST. FRANCIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Unfazed by Alemany High's slow start in a Del Rey League game at home Friday 
night, Joey Rosselli threw four second-half touchdown passes to lift the 
Indians over St. Francis, 32-17. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli, a left-handed senior, found Richard Dice on touchdown passes of 33, 
45 and 33 yards and Brian Brison on one of 44 yards to erase a 17-7 halftime 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we would score," said Rosselli, who entered the week with a Valley-area 
high 1,584 yards passing. He completed 18 of 26 for 301 yards. "The line gave 
me that split second I needed to get the ball off. I got whacked afterward but, 
hey." 
</P>
<P>
Alemany (5-4 overall, 2-1 in league play) kept alive its hopes for a 
second-place finish. St. Francis dropped to 1-8, 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Dice, a sophomore, made adjustments and was able to get behind the Golden 
Knights' secondary on each scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense was the opposite of what we were practicing this week," Dice 
said. "Their corners would go back and stop and I would go right by them." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it appeared as if St. Francis was poised to cruise right by the 
stunned Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Morales charged in from the two on fourth down with eight seconds to play 
in the first half. Kevin Hurley added the extra point to give the Knights a 
surprising 17-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring drive was kept alive when John Willis connected with Mike Torres on 
a 38-yard pass to the Alemany 18. On the following play, Torres caught a 
10-yard pass to put St. Francis in scoring range. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a 6-foot, 205-pound senior, gained 100 yards in 18 carries before 
intermission.

Running back Joey Tushnet rushed for 166 yards in 20 carries and scored two 
touchdowns to lead Reseda High to a 46-0 win over host Monroe on Friday night 
in a Mid-Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet, who had rushed for at least 200 yards in each of his past two games, 
outgained the entire Monroe offense, which was held to 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet has rushed for 586 yards in his past three games. Reseda (5-1-1, 4-1 in 
league play) rolled up 321 yards in offense, including 286 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
After exchanging punts with Monroe (1-5-1, 1-3-1) to open the game, Reseda 
marched 85 yards in 10 plays for a touchdown. Tushnet accounted for 80 yards in 
eight rushes, including a one-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet, who also scored on a 12-yard run, rushed for 121 yards in the first 
half. With Reseda leading after three quarters, 32-0, Tushnet left the game. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe quarterback Jesse Wallace completed five of 16 passes for 39 yards. 
Chris Garcia led Monroe with 63 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe moved deep into Reseda territory with less than a minute remaining, but 
Regent defender Erik Ferguson stepped in front of a pass by Ramey Antoun and 
raced 92 yards for the final touchdown. TIM MARTINEZ

FAURIA MATCHES HARVARD'S TOTAL OFFENSE IN 28-6 CRESPI VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE BARNATHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
See if this sounds familiar: A team enters a game heavily favored, plays 
indifferently, disappoints its coach, but still wins. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Crespi fit the description. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Celts defeated Harvard, 28-6, in a nonleague game at Harvard, it 
was less than a memorable day for the victors. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (6-3) started strongly, scoring on the first possession of the game, 
then remained nearly dormant until the fourth quarter when two touchdowns gave 
the Celts a 22-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
Celt tight end Christian Fauria finished with nine catches for 113 yards, 
matching Harvard's total offense. Sophomore quarterback Cody Smith, making his 
second start, completed 18 of 32 passes for 174 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi ate up most of the first quarter, fashioning an 85-yard drive in 18 
plays that was capped by Lucas Freeman's four-yard scoring run. Freeman led all 
rushers with 44 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
However, that was the last peep out of Crespi until the final 23 seconds of the 
half when linebacker Frank Romano batted an Adam Rowins pass to Joe Mahoney for 
an interception at the Harvard 23. On the last play of the half, Smith 
completed a nine-yard scoring pass to Fauria for a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He made good plays when he had to," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said of Smith. "He's 
only a sophomore, so he'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi snoozed through the third quarter, making only two first downs. 
Harvard's Mike Chumo picked up a Smith fumble and ran 17 yards for a touchdown 
at the start of the fourth quarter to cut the lead to 14-6. Crespi responded as 
Smith threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Mark Hollenbeck on the next 
possession. Reserve running back Rich Carranza added a 15-yard touchdown run to 
complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard (1-8) had 20 yards in total offense in the first half and 113 for the 
game. Adam Rowins passed for 70 yards (eight of 23) and Jeremiah Aguolu rushed 
for 31 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We were outmanned and we knew it," Coach Gary Thran said. LEE BARNATHAN

Pathon Rucker, was limited to 27 yards in 11 carries. Glendale (4-5, 2-2)

Burroughs 23, Burbank 19 -- Danny Suarez rushed for 70 yards and two touchdowns 
in 10 carries to lead Burroughs over its cross-town rival at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs (3-6, 2-2) built a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, scoring two 
touchdowns within 19 seconds. After Suarez, a senior running back, scored on an 
11-yard run with 4:43 to play in the period, Cliff Parker recovered a Burbank 
fumble on the Bulldogs' next offensive play and returned it seven yards for a 
score at the 4:24 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank (1-7-1, 0-4) cut the lead to 14-7 in the second quarter when 
quarterback Jason Chandler scored on a one-yard run. But Burroughs put the game 
away in the third period when running back Randye Rand of Burbank was tackled 
in the end zone by Roberto Vasquez for a safety. NAOMI TWARD

Ventura 28, Rio Mesa 27 -- Running back Danny Taylor rushed for 205 yards in 33 
carries and scored three touchdowns, including the go-ahead score on a 30-yard 
run in the second quarter, to lead Ventura (4-4-1, 2-4) at Rio Mesa. All the 
scoring came in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa tailback Gordy Abellera cut Ventura's lead to 28-27 with a 63-yard 
touchdown run with 4:19 left in the second quarter, but kicker Matt Zarit's 
extra-point attempt to tie the score sailed wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Henry Wilson had touchdown runs of one yard and 20 yards for Rio 
Mesa (4-5, 2-4) as the Spartans were eliminated from the playoff picture. PAUL

San Fernando 19, Chatsworth 8 -- Michael Wynn completed seven of 11 passes for 
72 yards and one touchdown and ran for another score to lead the Tigers in 
their 75th homecoming game. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's 28th career touchdown pass leaves him one shy of tying the school record 
held by Anthony Davis, the former USC star. 
</P>
<P>
LaKarlos Townsend scored on a three-yard run in the second quarter for San 
Fernando (5-3, 5-0). Townsend gained 27 yards in six carries. San Fernando 
running back Johnny Carter led all rushers with 91 yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth's lone score came on Kyle Beck's seven-yard touchdown in the fourth 
quarter. Beck rushed for 50 yards in 16 carries. Chatsworth (2-4-2, 1-4) was 
limited to 30 yards in total offense. Quarterback Brandon Ruedy had minus-42 
yards in nine carries. TODD JACOBSON

KURT SANDERLING BRINGS TRADITION OF OLD WORLD TO THE PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are many Los Angeles Philharmonmics these days. 
</P>
<P>
There is the blank, eminently professional ensemble that cranks out concert 
after concert for a numbing variety of hastily departing guest conductors at 
Hollywood Bowl. There is the neat and efficient orchestra that gives its 
dutiful best, even in lackluster repertory, for Andre Previn. There is the 
super-precise community of musicians that responds so alertly to the baton -- 
or is it a scalpel? -- of Pierre Boulez. There is the heartily generous 
Philharmonic that produces fastidiously exciting sounds at the urging of Simon 
Rattle. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot be quite sure what sort of a Philharmonic will emerge when Esa-Pekka 
Salonen finally comes to town and takes over. In the meantime, those who value 
warm, spacious, sensitive music-making that springs from a nearly extinct 
Old-World tradition can take comfort in the continuing visits of Kurt 
Sanderling. 
</P>
<P>
His, admittedly, is a strange case. German born and trained, he sidelined what 
might have become an international career when he emigrated to the Soviet Union 
in 1936. In 1960, he became a semi-secret weapon of the East German regime, 
focusing his activities on the inaccessible side of Berlin and in distant 
Dresden. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, he began to travel better-beaten paths. London has seen a lot 
of him. He has served as guest conductor with several American orchestras, most 
notably San Francisco and New York. Now 77, he earns decent respect wherever he 
goes, but in this age of monstrous egos and quirky personality cults, he is 
hardly considered a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he has commanded -- and deserved -- all-out reverence in Los 
Angeles since 1984. There must be something special, and something elusive, in 
the chemistry between this pensive, no-nonsense maestro and the collection of 
receptive, versatile players at his command here. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences and musicians in other centers regard Sanderling as a solid 
practitioner of his craft. Southern Californians cherish him, with good reason, 
as the most enlightened exponent of the mellow Germanic tradition to regularly 
grace our podium since the golden days of Bruno Walter. He belongs to an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he opened the concert with a 
festive yet fervent performance of Mozart's "Zauberflote" overture, the hints 
of charm counterbalanced by muscular solemnity. After intermission, he presided 
over a monumental reading of Beethoven's "Eroica." 
</P>
<P>
It began with agitation that took the Allegro con brio marking quite literally, 
slowed for a profoundly moving funeral march, flexed muscles without 
compromising grace in the Scherzo, and capped the closing passages of the final 
Allegro with a daring ritard -- a liberty that added romantic majesty to the 
inherent heroism. Under his gentle urgings, the Philharmonic mustered the 
breadth, the unanimity of phrasing, the dynamic flexibility, the balance of 
choirs and delicacy of nuance that identify a great orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
In the centerpiece of the program, Haydn's C-major Cello Concerto, Sanderling 
enforced poise and intimacy as a frame of reference for the solo exertions of 
Ronald Leonard. The principal cellist of the orchestra played with passionate 
fluency, commanding bravura and lean, elegant tone, all of which made the 
nearly inevitable pitch problems seem nearly irrelevant.

NO NEWS FOR THE DEAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Bay Area earthquake, television was accused of being slow to inform 
viewers of what was transpiring in Northern California. If desperation was 
suffered by viewers with hearing ability, think of the suffering of the deaf 
and hearing-impaired viewers. At least the hearing were able to obtain snatches 
of interviews and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
Not one Times writer mentioned the situation of the deaf and hearing-impaired 
viewers. No one seemed to give a thought to this significant portion of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC, the television stations and the networks refuse to give the deaf and 
hearing-impaired full access to the television media, even in cases of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The technology is available and in the possession of the stations. They should 
use it or lose their rights to broadcast. The airwaves belong to all the 
people, not just those who can hear. 
</P>
<P>
ABRAHAM GOTTFRIED, Century City

Spokesmen for several of the major television stations in Los Angeles said the 
stations do not have the capability to broadcast captioned news in emergencies.

The Joe Eszterhas/Michael Ovitz flap ("How One Letter Has Divided Hollywood,"

ridiculous: Ovitz, whom the film writer accuses of saying, "You'll never work 
in this town again" . . . or Eszterhas for believing him.

STAGE WIRE: THE NEW YORK CRITICS MEET 'ST. LOUIS' WITH MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember "Meet Me in St. Louis"? Remember Judy Garland on the trolley? Remember 
"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"? and "The Boy Next Door"? 
</P>
<P>
A $6-million stage version of the classic 1943 MGM musical opened Thursday 
night at Broadway's Gershwin Theatre. Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane have 
supplemented their original score with 10 new songs, and the cast likewise 
mixes familiar faces (Betty Garrett as the Irish maid) and fresh ones (Donna 
Kane as the girl next door). 
</P>
<P>
The critics issued a split report. They agreed that it was an old-fashioned 
show, and some of them enjoyed it for that very reason. "Maybe it's the onset 
of middle age, but I found 'Meet Me in St. Louis' an unexpected delight," wrote 
Howard Kissell in the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
"If the show doesn't charm you, your heart must be even harder than a theater 
critic's." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press was uncharmed. He liked Donna Kane's 
"perky" performance, but found the songs and the book "second-hand and as 
emotionally involving as a saccharine greeting card." 
</P>
<P>
"It's reminiscent of those undemanding, undistinguished shows of yore, the kind 
that had big, expensive sets, pretty costumes, athletic dancing, maybe a star 
or two and a couple of hummable tunes. But what may have been, let's say, the 
best musical of 1953, has a tougher time on Broadway 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich of the New York Times was ready to meet "Meet Me in St. Louis" 
halfway. It succeeded in "spreading the good will earned by the overture," he 
thought. But it also displayed certain slight defects: "insipid acting, an 
inane book and a complete lack of originality." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Winer of Newsday was not persuaded. "This is a bankrupt idea with a major 
bankroll -- a contradiction that amounts to very, very fancy summer stock." 
</P>
<P>
Will "Meet Me in St. Louis" celebrate Christmas on Broadway, or will it be gone 
by Thanksgiving? Stay tuned.

Kevin Dillon says he doesn't really mind being thought of as Matt Dillon's 
younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected it from the start," says the 23-year-old actor with an air of 
laid-back good grace. "I'm proud to be Matt's brother. I think he's a great 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, "Wanting to get out from under that makes me fight to work even 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon's fight to work ("I'm still an auditioner") has put him squarely in 
front of the public in recent weeks, with the back-to-back film releases "War 
Party" and "Immediate Family" -- in addition to his role as a sympathetic 
friend in "When He's Not a Stranger," a date-rape TV movie airing Monday night 
at 9 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
He is especially proud of "Immediate Family," in which he plays the teen father 
of Mary Stuart Masterson's baby, scrutinizing potential adoptive parents Glenn 
Close and James Woods. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends who've been in situations like that -- getting a girl pregnant 
-- so I used some of what these guys went through. It's a very tough thing," 
says Dillon, who won critical praise for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Making the movie also taught the single actor that "I myself am not ready for 
fatherhood. Some day, but not now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the way they cry all the time," he complains with a laugh. "He 
ruined some of my best takes, that baby!" STACY JENEL SMITH

PIANIST SHURA CHERKASSKY RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quirky, old-fashioned, highly personal and brilliantly colored, the pianism of 
Shura Cherkassky reminds us of an age when keyboard celebrities actually had 
distinct personalities, and none of them sounded like another. 
</P>
<P>
Those days -- the early decades of this century -- are gone, but Cherkassky, 
now 78, remains. Returning to Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on Thursday 
night, the Odessa-born musician demonstrated again the glory of old times. 
</P>
<P>
It was not as deep, stormy or kaleidoscopic a demonstration as one might have 
hoped, or as Cherkassky himself has given here in the past. The petite pianist 
limited his repertory to one masterpiece and four charming trifles, adding two 
more miniatures as encores after the program proper. He did not deal in 
revelations this time around. Or in startling insights into the post-Romantic 
era. 
</P>
<P>
For all the wealth of detail and the touching moments Cherkassky brought to 
Schumann's massive Fantasy, Opus 17, his cherishable performance fell far short 
of the monumental. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of creating dramatic heights, martial thunder and poetic self-communion 
in these contrasting movements, the pianist settled for intimations and 
indications of such. He did not conquer the territory so much as he walked over 
it. Not surprisingly, our handkerchiefs remained unused. 
</P>
<P>
But he caressed the living daylights out of Tchaikovsky's exquisite Theme and 
Variations in F, Handel's "Harmonious Blacksmith" (the odd program-opener), 
Rachmaninoff's G-minor Barcarolle, and his two encores, a sexy and insinuating 
Tango in D by Albeniz-Godowsky and a straight-faced Tarantella of Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
And he romped gamely, if with more than a fair share of clinkers, through the 
innocent rhetoric and naive charms of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody.

'GARY COOPER' DETAILS LIFE, LEGENDS OF ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Cooper, the blue-eyed cowboy from Helena, Mont., was without question the 
most beautiful of all the great American actors, the most genuinely modest and 
one of the most unselfconsciously graceful. Like Henry Fonda, he became the 
perfect image on whom we could project our feelings of what a right-thinking 
American should be: a man of few but telling words, of unquestioned integrity 
and deep-rooted values. 
</P>
<P>
If you doubt that, take a look at "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" 
(Sunday at 7 p.m. on TNT cable), a powerful and nostalgic summing-up of the 
Cooper life and emerging myth. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike recent film biographies (John Huston, George Stephens or William Wyler), 
this one has no interviews with cronies or co-stars to give it supporting 
ballast or insider insights. Instead, author and critic Richard Schickel has 
created a narrative, entrusted it to Clint Eastwood -- not a bad choice to 
comment on another laconic American legend -- and picked the film clips that 
most closely support Schickel's own theories. 
</P>
<P>
The results may be a bit skewed, because they slight most of Cooper's urbane or 
sophisticated characters and much of his deft light comedy in favor of his 
Capra-Everymen and his Westerners, Virginians or Plainsmen. Nevertheless, it's 
a literate, compulsively watchable hour. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, an hourlong program with breaks for commercials isn't long 
enough to explore how Cooper, the consummate screen actor, learned how to use 
the camera so potently, or from whom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for a biography whose consultant was the star's only child, Maria Cooper 
Janis, this film is relatively frank about the affair that created the greatest 
upheaval in the actor's life: his romantic involvement at the age of 47 with 
his co-star in "The Fountainhead," 22-year old Patricia Neal. Their 2-year 
affair, during which he left his family, is introduced as the moral conflict of 
Cooper's life, although to understand anything about emotions on either side, 
you'd have to turn to other biographies or autobiographies. Clips from "The 
Fountainhead" aren't quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
Schickel finds in Cooper's last, restorative films -- "High Noon," "Friendly 
Persuasion," "They Came to Cordura," et al. -- a man returned to his best self, 
as well as to his family at the end of the Neal affair. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably "High Noon" and "Cooper's public defense of the writer when he was 
attacked by witch hunters" washes away the image of Cooper's disingenuous 
performance as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities 
Committee. Certainly, it is more healing to close, as the biography does, with 
the Cooper of Frank Capra and with a final legacy of images of the shiningly 
handsome, quintessentially American young man, at a time in which everything 
seemed to lie before him, and us, "so various, so beautiful, so new."SHEILA

ORDINARY 'LAKE WOBEGON' WEAKENED BY SIGHT GAGS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new 90-minute special -- "Lake Wobegon Loyalty Days," showing at 9 p.m. 
Sunday on the Disney Channel -- we find Garrison Keillor in a ribald Viking 
costume, with a staff topped by a fish. These are the ancient habilaments of 
the Sons of Knute. He inducts the audience in Minneapolis into the order by 
reading the sacred creed, concluding with six "oh-yahs" and two snorts, 
"signifying the clearing of the head." 
</P>
<P>
To true Keillorians, we reject sight gags (though amusing), including the use 
of the Minnesota Orchestra as straight men and women for Keillor parodies 
(though amusing). 
</P>
<P>
These are essentially impure. 
</P>
<P>
What we need is the news from home, that the school board has decided not to 
fire Lyle: "Poplar trees on the south side of the school will be bare on 
account of the fact that the caterpillars that hatched out in his 11th-grade 
biology class unit on larvae turned out to be tent worms. A lot of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Krebsbach reported an amazing event on the plane back from Phoenix, that 
the male attendant asked him if he liked gay men. Sent him into trauma. But the 
guys at the Chatterbox figured out that he was really asking if Carl liked game 
hen for supper. Carl remembered, "Yah, we did have little chickens."

'GLORY' A STRONG DRAMA ON SCIENTIFIC SLEUTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Glory Enough for All" is such a singularly strong television drama that you 
hesitate to report that it's about the discovery of insulin, lest heads start 
to nod. 
</P>
<P>
This Canadian-produced, true-life, medical research adventure story set in the 
1920s is a "Masterpiece Theatre" plum. The two 90-minute parts (Sunday at 9 
p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24; concluding Nov. 12) 
will deeply touch anyone who has had to confront diabetes. More broadly, the 
production implicitly signals contemporary topics ranging from AIDS to animal 
medical research to Nobel Prize squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
The parallels are all there in material rich in period detail and, 
particularly, the irascible performance of Canadian actor R. H. Thomson. He 
stars as later-Nobel winner Dr. Frederick Banting, whom we meet as a World War 
I front-line surgeon sewing doughboys together, a "MASH"-like scene that 
establishes his gritty texture. 
</P>
<P>
Once home, this irascible, socially awkward and almost-failed doctor, dumped by 
his fiancee, pitches his bloodied tent in a primitive University of Toronto 
lab. There, in the hot summer of 1921, swatting flies and going through 91 dogs 
whose carcasses pile up, he and his young colleague (an engaging performance by 
Robert Wisen) inject an experimental extract into a dog with a diabetic 
pancreas. The moment becomes a medical milestone. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, once the insulin is purified for humans and a cure is out there, 
victims are turned down because there's not enough of it. At the same time, 
petty jealousies and politics among rival doctors who want the credit for the 
breakthrough consume an egotistical establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness and backbiting is topped off when the Nobel Prize Committee 
commits a gross miscarriage of honor. Banting wins but refuses to go to 
Stockholm to collect his prize because his Nobel co-winner and Banting's 
longtime nemesis at the University of Toronto, Dr. J.J.R McLeod (John 
Woodvine), didn't earn the honor. (Years later, in 1950, the Noble people 
rectified the mistake and awarded the co-prize for discovering insulin to 
Banting's colleague, Charles Best.) 
</P>
<P>
As "Masterpiece Theatre" host Alistair Cook cautions at the top of the show, 
"Rarely is there a single hero (in medical discoveries)." And rarely does 
medical history make such telling drama. The production was directed by Eric 
Till and written by Grahame Woods. RAY LOYND

'PROFESSOR'S' CHANNING DARINGLY COMIC ON KCET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge Reinhold is "The Sad Professor," the title character in the fourth 
installment of this season's KCET comedy series "Trying Times" (Sunday at 8 
p.m. and Tuesday at 10 p.m. on Channel 28). 
</P>
<P>
This professor starts crying at unexpected moments. Although barely 30, he's 
going through a premature mid-life crisis. He's tired of his perfectly 
supportive wife (Linda Purl). Suddenly his salvation becomes clear in a dream 
-- he casts his eye on an English department colleague, the slatternly Hilde 
Bundt (Stockard Channing). Call him crazy, but he falls for her. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour, written by Richard Greenberg and directed by Christopher Guest, 
is most notable for Channing's bitter, blowzy Hilda, a daringly comic 
performance. Reinhold and Purl are fine, but the writing doesn't have the 
resonance of the opening two episodes of this year's "Trying Times." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's an improvement over last week's episode, Albert Innaurato's "Death 
and Taxes," a laborious fantasy about an orthopedic-shoe salesman (Peter 
Scolari) who runs into trouble with the IRS. DON SHIRLEY

UNITED CABLE FINE MAY GO TO IMPROVING ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Cable, fined $300,000 for delays in establishing service to the east San 
Fernando Valley, may end up applying its fine directly toward improved public 
access services at the station. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Telecommunications Commission voted Friday to review a proposal 
for spending the money on either additional full-time staff or interns to work 
on providing improved public access broadcast quality. Public access channels, 
on which the public can appear free of charge, are required of local cable 
franchises by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission decides to make the proposal official at its next meeting 
Nov. 17 and if the plan is ultimately approved by the council, it will be the 
first time that the city has applied fines against a cable television company 
directly to improving that company's service. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, fines have gone to a general fund used citywide at the discretion 
of the Department of Telecommunications. But the council decided earlier this 
fall to make sure that East Valley residents who suffered because of the cable 
delays would benefit from the fines. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal was to offer rebates to customers. But David Hankin, chief of the 
regulatory bureau of the telecommunications department, said commissioners 
expressed a desire Friday to do something with lasting impact. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt a one-time rebate really wouldn't have an impact," he said. "It 
would just go away." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined Nov. 17 is whether the money would add people to United 
Cable's staff or whether an independent public access corporation would be 
formed to augment public access at the station. 
</P>
<P>
United Cable promised to complete the Valley system within two years when it 
won the franchise in 1983. But lines were not extended into all of the East 
Valley until May. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, United Cable has been fined more than $1 million for delays, 
nearly half of which was waived after company officials persuaded council 
members that they had misunderstood some of the city's regulations. So far, the 
company has actually paid $236,200.

COURT LETS SALVATION ARMY KEEP STREET-CORNER GOSPEL; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: DAILY SERMONS CAN CONTINUE ON AN OFFICE BUILDING'S PRIVATE FRONTAGE 
BUT MUST BE QUIETER. BUILDING OWNERS HAD SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE 
PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Van Nuys Municipal Court commissioner ruled Friday that the Salvation Army 
may preach and solicit contributions outside a Sherman Oaks office building -- 
as long as members turn down the volume. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Manly D. Calof said the religious and charitable organization may 
continue to exhort passers-by at the corner of Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards 
to repent, rejoice and contribute to its cause. But the proselytizing must be 
inaudible inside the nearby Trans World Bank Building, Calof cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Calof's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the building's owners, 
United Properties Co., seeking a preliminary injunction to oust the 
organization from the privately owned open space. 
</P>
<P>
Since July, attorneys and accountants laboring through their lunch hours inside 
the 13-story building have been distracted daily by fluegelhorn music, 
tambourines, hymn singing and amplified readings of Leviticus from the pavement 
below, the building's owners claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Brand, an attorney on the third floor of the building, said he is 
bothered each day by the group's "singing, preaching, ranting and raving from 
12 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army officials said they are not sure exactly what Calof's order 
means but they'll stop using amplifiers while they study it and decide whether 
to contest the matter in court. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I allowed to use a megaphone?" Capt. John Purdell, 57, head of the group's 
San Fernando Valley operations, wondered aloud after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army officials say amplification of some sort is necessary to be 
heard above the traffic, and moving to another spot is out of the question 
because the intersection is the busiest in the Valley, perfect for exhorting 
the populace. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, they have pledged to God to read the Bible from start to finish at 
that spot, Purdell said. The group entered a Bible into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has sporadically used the site for six years without 
objections, said Alan L. Rosen, an attorney representing the building's owners. 
Rosen said he was satisfied with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the army would come for a day and then leave, three or four times 
a year," he said. But in July, the organization stepped up its schedule to 
one-hour sessions seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The army balked at informal requests from the building's owners to move. When 
building maintenance workers erected makeshift barricades with sawhorses and 
strands of nylon ribbon, Purdell ceremoniously cut the ribbons and resumed 
preaching. The owners then filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Calof did not address lawsuit allegations that the army was "accosting" some 
tenants and their clients in an attempt to get contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed with the court, attorney Benjamin Felton, who works in 
the building, said he was asked for a donation twice on Oct. 17 as he left for 
and returned from lunch. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rosen, one passer-by was told that a homeless family could be fed 
for the cost of a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Purdell denies that verbal solicitations are made. 
</P>
<P>
"We never asked people for money. Talk to anybody who's seen us," he said in a 
pleasant, clipped British accent. "I personally abhor buttonholing, accosting 
and intimidating. If any comment was made, perhaps it was by an overly 
enthusiastic worker." 
</P>
<P>
Purdell also denied another allegation: that Salvation Army workers dance 
during the daily proselytizing sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's referring to the fact that when I sing an up-tempo gospel song, I 
have difficulty keeping my feet still," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Purdell said the organization has received letters from people who say they 
have seen and heard the group at the Ventura Boulevard site. Some say they have 
been moved to tears. Others enclose money and urge the group to keep up its 
good work, Purdell said. 
</P>
<P>
Money collected by the organization goes toward operating shelters for homeless 
men in Van Nuys and Canoga Park, feeding the homeless, and providing hotel 
rooms for homeless children and their parents, Purdell said. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that private property open to the public can 
be used by charitable, political and other groups. In the 1980 case of 
Pruneyard Shopping Center vs. Robins, the court upheld a California Supreme 
Court decision that the state had a right to require a mall near San Jose to 
serve as a public forum. But the court said the mall may impose reasonable 
rules and restrictions.

HOTFOOTING BY SNOWSHOE; 
</P>
<P>
OUTDOORS: 2 MEN CONQUER DEATH VALLEY'S TREACHEROUS SALT BOGS WITH ODD FOOTGEAR, 
THEN ASCEND MT. WHITNEY. 
</P>

<P>
Two Antelope Valley men have succeeded in a pioneering attempt to cross Death 
Valley's blazing hot salt bogs in snowshoes during a trek from the lowest point 
in the contiguous United States to the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoorsmen Lee Bergthold and Jerry Freeman used snowshoes to cross the eight 
miles of salt bogs during a grueling 14-day hike from Death Valley to Mt. 
Whitney, said Chief Ranger Dale Antonich of the Death Valley National Monument. 
Bergthold and Freeman completed the journey a week ago, five days behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Forest Service rangers said Friday that they will begin using snowshoes 
for rescues in the Death Valley salt bogs. Previously hikers have died, been 
rescued or turned back from the bogs, which have a treacherously thin crust 
above quicksand-like salt brine. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed us it could be done," said Antonich, who joked in a telephone 
interview that Bergthold and Freeman had served as guinea pigs. "We figured it 
would work. We have snowshoes here, but we didn't have any we wanted to try 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Bergthold, 54, a survival instructor at Antelope Valley College, and Freeman, 
47, a self-employed businessman, spent the week resting and relishing their 
success. The 125 miles hit them with extreme heat and cold, dehydration, minor 
injuries and rough terrain. And a blizzard unexpectedly turned the climactic 
Mt. Whitney climb into an ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were worried about the salt bogs," said Freeman, who sprained a hand while 
climbing a rock face. "Mt. Whitney should have been reasonably easy." 
</P>
<P>
Others have made the Death Valley-Mt. Whitney hike, but Bergthold and Freeman 
wanted to be the first trekkers to cross the salt bogs. They believed that 
snowshoes would allow them to slide across the delicate surface without 
breaking through. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
Antonich said rangers will follow their lead during rescues. "That's the only 
reason we go out there," he said. "It's not like we do a lot of pleasure hikes 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
After the salt bogs, temperatures of 110 degrees made eight days of desert 
walking an inferno, Bergthold and Freeman said. Dehydration and almost 
impassable canyons put them behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some of the hairiest climbing I've ever done," Bergthold said. "And the 
lack of water was a problem. Jerry had cotton mouth so bad his mouth was 
hinging shut." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's brother furnished the men with water and winter gear at Keeler, the 
beginning of the mountain leg. During the ascent of 14,495-foot Mt. Whitney, a 
sudden blizzard "nearly blew us off the mountain," Freeman said. 
</P>

The expected two-day climb took four days, according to rangers who tracked the 
pair's progress. Bergthold and Freeman spent a triumphant night at the top of 
Mt. Whitney in a meteorological hut, with temperatures outside dropping to 50 
below with the wind chill. 
</P>
<P>
Bergthold said: "We were tired, haggard and we lost weight. But we felt we were 
in darn good condition after all the work we'd done" during the 14-day odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Lancaster Museum and Art Gallery have tentative plans to 
feature Bergthold's photos of the trip when the museum schedule permits, 
probably in 1991. Bergthold and Freeman hope that the exhibit will also feature 
their gear -- particularly the snowshoes.

SHERIFF ENDORSES TAX MEASURE FOR SANTA CLARITA VALLEY ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying he considers a $285-million tax measure to build roads in the Santa 
Clarita Valley important for safety, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block 
has endorsed the measure and is urging voters to approve it when they go to the 
polls next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Roads Now Committee, which has attempted to portray Measure P as a safety 
issue, announced Block's endorsement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee already had the backing of the Los Angeles County Firefighters 
Assn. and this week announced the endorsements of the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department Assn. of Chiefs and the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Roads Now Committee, Block wrote: "I usually do not take an 
active role on local political issues, but I view Proposition P on the November 
7th ballot as a safety issue. The road projects funded by Proposition P are 
critical to emergency vehicles' ability to get to their destinations quickly 
and safely." 
</P>
<P>
The Roads Now Committee concedes that it will not be easy to win the two-thirds 
vote needed to pass the measure. An opposing group says developers and 
government, not homeowners, should pay for roads.

AGOURA HILLS COUNCILMAN LOSES ALLIES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FOR AGOURA '89 HAS ENDORSED CHALLENGER ED KURTZ OVER COUNCILMAN JACK 
W. KOENIG. IN 1985, A SIMILAR GROUP HELPED ELECT KOENIG. 
</P>

<P>
A political action group largely credited with electing Darlene McBane, Fran 
Pavley and Jack W. Koenig to the Agoura Hills City Council in 1985 endorsed 
McBane and Pavley for reelection Friday but dropped its support of Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
The group, For Agoura '89, endorsed challenger Ed Kurtz instead of Koenig in 
Tuesday's election. Koenig has been feuding with the rest of the council for 
months. The group had made no secret of its discontent with Koenig, who last 
month was accused of participating in a failed attempt to recall the other four 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig has vehemently denied involvement in the recall. But For Agoura '89 
spokesman Tom Yacovone said the group was influenced by a sworn declaration 
from a former recall activist who said Koenig had helped plan recall strategy. 
The statement by Paul Foote was taken as part of a libel lawsuit filed by City 
Councilwoman Louise C. Rishoff against two recall proponents. 
</P>
<P>
Yacovone said Koenig's involvement in the developer-backed recall was a 
betrayal because Koenig was "somebody who in 1985 ran on a slow-growth 
platform." Even if Foote's charges are not true, Yacovone added, Koenig should 
be faulted for publicly staying on the sidelines and not supporting the other 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, who insists that he was supportive of the others, was the only council 
member not targeted by the recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a group of 14 people met at an Agoura Hills pizza parlor and formed 
For Agoura '85 to oppose several council members they viewed as 
pro-development. The California Commission on Campaign Financing, in a report 
on Agoura Hills this year, credited the group with launching a grass-roots 
campaign that reelected Pavley and installed McBane and Koenig. For Agoura '89 
boasts a membership of more than 250 in the city of 20,200 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said Friday that the group is much smaller and not the same as the one 
that supported him in 1985. He called the endorsements a joke and called on 
Kurtz to denounce them. He said the organization is Kurtz's "dirty tricks 
committee, his hit group" because six members are Kurtz supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz would not comment on Koenig's statements except to say that he is not a 
member of For Agoura '89. 
</P>
<P>
Yacovone said For Agoura '89 has many of the same leaders and is basically the 
same community-based organization as For Agoura '85. 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed in Agoura Hills since the council's pro-growth majority 
was deposed in 1985. The 1987 and 1989 campaigns were less charged because the 
city has had fewer development controversies. 
</P>
<P>
Also, For Agoura '85 raised about $8,000 four years ago, which it used to 
campaign on behalf of McBane, Pavley and Koenig. But in this campaign, For 
Agoura '89 had raised just $695 through Oct. 26, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz and Koenig differ most significantly on their political allegiances. 
While Koenig's critics say he cannot work with the rest of the council, Kurtz 
has emphasized that if elected, he would be a team player. 
</P>
<P>
Three seats are up for grabs in Tuesday's election, with Koenig, McBane and 
Pavley running in a field with three challengers -- Kurtz, Paul G. (Gary) 
Mueller and Barry S. Steinhardt.

MAN GIVES UP AFTER BARRICADING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 75-year-old man apparently despondent over medical problems barricaded 
himself in his Castaic house for 4 1/2 hours and fired at least two shots 
before surrendering Friday afternoon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Neely was taken to Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for a 72-hour 
psychiatric observation after he walked out the front door of his house with 
his hands above his head about 4:30 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Martha Neely, left the house in the 31600 block of Cherry Drive about 
noon to call for help after he fired a handgun at the ceiling, Lt. Dennis Burns 
said. No one was hit, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly afterward and called for the sheriff's 
Special Weapons Team and Crisis Negotiation Team, which arrived about 2 p.m., 
authorities said. Neely gave himself up after a negotiator asked him repeatedly 
over a loudspeaker to come out of the house, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop said Neely was depressed over heart problems and a 
recent bout with emphysema. He has no history of violent behavior or run-ins 
with law enforcement, Roop said.

CLASS SIZE, ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS DOMINATE CONEJO VALLEY SCHOOL ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TUESDAY'S VOTING FINDS 12 CANDIDATES, INCLUDING THREE INCUMBENTS, 
VYING FOR FOUR SEATS ON THE BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Reducing the size of classes, expanding anti-drug programs and finding the 
money to accomplish both are top issues in the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District's Board of Education election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The district encompasses Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and the Ventura County 
portion of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve candidates are seeking four seats on the five-member board. The trustees 
are elected to four-year terms and are paid $4,800 a year plus medical 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Two candidates are vying to complete the unexpired term of George Hatcher, who 
was elected to the board in 1987 and moved out of town last year. His term ends 
in 1991. Dorothy Beaubien, a retired teacher who was appointed to Hatcher's 
seat, is running to retain the position. She is being challenged by Thomas M. 
Murphy, a small-business owner. 
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are competing for three full terms on the board, including 
incumbents William H. Henry Jr. and Mildred C. Lynch. Board member Ellen 
Wilkins is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the candidates cited community concern over class size, especially 
the combining of first- and second-grade and second- and third-grade students 
in elementary school classes. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. William Seaver said primary grades have been combined in recent years in 
an effort to meet state limits on the numbers of students in each class. The 
number of students entering elementary schools has been climbing at about 200 
per year because of an increase in the birth rate, he said. Yet, he said, the 
district has not had the funds to hire more teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Seaver said the district is beginning to bring in new teachers and is reducing 
the number of combined classes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 21% of elementary school classes were combined, while that figure 
dropped to 7% this year, he said. The average class size in the Conejo district 
-- about 30 in elementary schools and 32 in high schools -- was similar to 
those in neighboring school systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district hopes to use about $1.2 million in state education funds from 
Proposition 98 to add 11 teachers. Under the district's present labor 
contracts, however, teachers and other school employees are entitled to a 
portion of that money for salary increases. Negotiations are under way with 
three unions that represent teachers, school psychologists and support staff. 
</P>
<P>
Seaver said the district hopes to receive an estimated $50,000 from a new 
tobacco sales tax to expand drug education programs. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates for full terms, in alphabetical order, are: 
</P>
<P>
* N. (Chuck) Castaing, 51, owner of a dental supply company. A political novice 
whose three children have graduated from the school system, he said seeking 
office was a natural progression from his volunteer work in the district and in 
the Optimists and Elks clubs. Castaing said the school board should "have a 
little more backbone" on tough issues. He cited class size as a crucial issue 
and said Proposition 98 funds should be used to hire more teachers, not to give 
instructors salary raises. 
</P>
<P>
* Martha deBurgh, 40, who has children ages 9 and 11 in the school system and 
is a volunteer at Acacia Elementary School and Redwood Intermediate School. She 
said she is running for the school board, her first attempt at public office, 
because she views the job "as a logical extension of what I've been doing." She 
said she is concerned about improving academic standards for all students. She 
said she is concerned about class size but believes that it is a statewide 
issue that ultimately must be solved on that level. 
</P>
<P>
* Henry, 62, director of training and development for Lockheed Corp. who is 
seeking a second term. He served about three years on the school board in 
Plainfield, N. J., before he was transferred to California seven years ago. 
Although his three children are grown, he said he is running because he has a 
doctorate in education and considers it his business. He acknowledged community 
concern about class size but said, "I worry we're focusing all our attention on 
that, and feel we need to be careful we're not overlooking other things we can 
do to maintain and improve upon educational excellence generally." Henry said 
he wanted to raise expectations of students, teachers and parents, and 
suggested that could be achieved by reducing permissiveness and "not tolerating 
poor work by those who are capable of doing better." 
</P>
<P>
* Lynch, an incumbent and retired high school English teacher who taught for 35 
years in Los Angeles County. She said she is seeking a second term to finish 
projects undertaken during her first four years -- mainly the strengthening of 
the English honors program in the district's three high schools. 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Sean Markey, 34, a detective in the Compton Police Department's 
traffic division. Although this is his first attempt at elected office, Markey 
serves on a traffic safety committee in Compton and was a member of a citizens 
general plan advisory committee in El Segundo, where he lived prior to moving 
to Thousand Oaks a year ago. He recently served on a community development 
grant-allocation committee in Thousand Oaks. Markey has children ages 4 and 1 
and said he is running because he wants to improve the district for his own 
children and others. He said the two issues that concern him most are drugs and 
crime in the schools, particularly a recent vandalism attack on Newbury Park 
High School that caused an estimated $30,000 in damage to a home economics lab. 
</P>
<P>
* Richard F. (Dick) Newman, 61, a retired Simi Valley police lieutenant and a 
seven-year member of the Conejo Recreation and Park District board. He said he 
would resign from the parks board if elected to the school board. Although his 
three children are grown, Newman said he considers himself a district parent 
because he and his wife are foster parents who have taken in 42 children over 
23 years. A volunteer drug-abuse counselor at Sequoia Intermediate School, 
Newman said providing a quality education is his top priority, especially to 
children who are neither gifted nor disabled. 
</P>
<P>
* Ken Penchos, 46, director of information systems for Superior Industries, a 
maker of cast aluminum automotive wheels. Penchos has children ages 10 and 6 in 
Banyan Elementary School, where he serves as chairman of the school site 
council, a committee that decides how to use state funds for improvements. He 
said he decided to run because he believes that the district has made poor use 
of computer technology, a field he considers essential to graduates entering 
the job market. He also said the district could run more efficiently and ease 
overburdened student-teacher ratios by increasing its use of computers. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles E. Rittenburg, 38, an operations research and systems analysis 
engineer for Northrop's Ventura County division. He said he is running because 
he has four children, three in the school system, and because, as a West Point 
graduate, he has been imbued with the ethic of service to nation and community. 
A political novice, he cited efficient financial management as the key to the 
district's problems, whether expanding drug-abuse education programs or hiring 
more teachers to reduce class size. One way for the district to save money 
would be to take better advantage of volunteer organizations' contributions and 
labor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Vance (Skip) Rodgers, 36, a construction company owner. A political novice, 
he is running because he has two sons, ages 12 and 7, in the school system and 
has been "personally dissatisfied with overall test results and the way the 
schools have been slipping in overall ratings." Rodgers said the school board 
should be more aggressive in getting funding from the state. He said he 
believes that many students are using illegal drugs or alcohol and could 
benefit from a program geared toward teen-agers but similar in approach to 
Alcoholics Anonymous. He said teen-agers could talk with peers, rebuild 
self-esteem and receive treatment referrals. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeanie Mortensen Savage, 34, a computer program analyst who has children ages 
12, 9 and 5. She said the chief reason for running is her concern that none of 
the board's present members have children enrolled in the district. Her first 
priority would be reducing class size because "parents feel it's extremely 
important and have been promised it for years and years and not seeing anything 
being done." She favors using Proposition 98 money to hire more teachers. She 
also wants to expand drug education programs, especially in elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
For the unexpired term of George Hatcher, the candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
* Beaubien, 57, the incumbent appointed last year to replace Hatcher. She is a 
retired teacher with 26 years in the district. She was chairman of the English 
department at Newbury Park High School, a work experience coordinator at 
Westlake High School and now teaches part time at Cal Lutheran University. 
Beaubien favors using Proposition 98 funds to hire more teachers and reduce 
class size. Her top priority would be strengthening the district's vocational 
program. 
</P>
<P>
* Murphy, owner of a small business who provided neither a work nor home phone 
number in public records and could not be reached for comment.

The Senate voted on Friday to issue gold and silver coins to mark the 50th 
anniversary in 1991 of the presidential memorial at Mt. Rushmore in South 
Dakota's Black Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which now goes to the House, calls for the minting of 500,000 
gold coins bearing a face value of $5 and 2.5 million silver $1 coins. Both 
would be sold at a premium, with half of the profits being used to reduce the 
federal budget deficit and half to go to improve, enlarge and renovate the 
monument and its facilities and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 2.5 million half-dollar Mt. Rushmore coins would be struck as 
legal tender.

Cal State Fullerton's Mike Pringle needs 17 yards against New Mexico State 
today at Santa Ana Stadum to become only the fourth Titan to rush for 1,000 
yards, and Dan Speltz needs 195 yards to become the school's career passing 
yardage leader. 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton, 3-4-1 overall and 2-2 in the Big West Conference, must win its 
final three games in order to post its first winning record since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State is winless this season and 4-37 over the past four seasons 
under Coach Mike Knoll, who is in the final year of a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Phil Vinson, the Aggies' quarterback, has struggled in recent games, and 
Knoll said that junior Phil Maloof possibly could start and probably will play.

ENCINITAS COMPOSER'S SCORE LEAPS FROM MOVIE TO STAGE, BUT CRITICS SCORN MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encinitas composer Hugh Martin waited for 30 years for his "Meet Me in St. 
Louis" score (with Ralph Blane) to make the transition from the 1944 MGM movie 
classic, starring Judy Garland, to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Martin hoped a warm reception for this $6-million musical about a 
turn-of-the-century middle-class Missouri family would signal a renewed 
interest in the kind of songs he still writes. But those hopes have not been 
born out by the New York critics. The reviews for the show, which opened 
Thursday night at the Gershwin Theater, found most New York critics carping 
that, despite lavish, no-expense-spared sets -- complete with a trolley and a 
real skating rink -- the trip down memory lane was not worth the effort. The 
now classic songs by Martin and Blane -- "The Trolley Song," "The Boy Next 
Door," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" -- escaped censure, but the 10 
new songs composed by the team were put down as "no patch on the original 'St. 
Louis' score" by Frank Rich of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rich had kinder words for Martin's music -- "consistent with the 1940s' 
Tin Pan Alley sound that is so endearing in Mr. Martin's output" -- than he did 
for the lyrics, which he called "laughably silly." 
</P>
<P>
Rich and Clive Barnes of the New York Post both praised the good will generated 
by the show, but with reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Rich conceded that "Meet Me in St. Louis" is superior to the other latter-day 
Broadway adaptations of MGM musicals, like "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" 
and "Singin' in the Rain," but added, "It's not high praise to say so." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes put the show down as "old-fashioned rather than classic, ancient rather 
than antique." 
</P>
<P>
Only Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News reacted in just the way producers 
Louis Burke and Joan Brickhill might have wished, calling the show "an 
unexpected delight." 
</P>
<P>
Kissel described the actors as having "a middle-American innocence I thought 
had been banished from the musical theater by its grandiose pretensions in 
recent years. It was all I could do to keep from crying. . . . There are dull 
stretches, songs that don't really pay off, a bit too much moving of scenery, 
but if the show doesn't charm you, your heart must be even harder than a 
theater critic's."

NBA HAS FINALLY BECOME A NAME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael? 
</P>
<P>
Yep. 
</P>
<P>
Michael wins the NBA title? 
</P>
<P>
Over Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Pro basketball has crashed the big time. It's a shorthand, one-name kind of 
game now, like baseball always has been and the NFL became when Johnny U. beat 
Sam and Frank in '58. 
</P>
<P>
Pay-per-dunk finally reached nonsensical money parity this summer, when the 
rampantly non-productive Jon Koncak was given a $13.2 million contract spread 
over six years. 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize the glut of teams in our team sports, circle Sunday, Dec. 10. 
That's when Orlando (Woolridge) and Magic are scheduled to play the Orlando 
Magic. In Orlando. (If the Lakers win big but their front court sub plays 
badly, imagine the headline: Magic Disappears; So Does Orlando.) 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with the Bullets is that they have only one one-name player. And 
Bernard no longer is Bernard. Make the Bullets as plucky as last season but not 
quite so lucky, winners 37 times, down three from last season. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, including a statistical being called TENDEX, expects John Williams 
to emerge as a major force in the NBA. In truth, TENDEX insists Williams 
approached that last season. 
</P>
<P>
TENDEX is a percentage that involves the vital basketball statistics, positive 
and negative, divided by minutes played. Also factored in is the pace at which 
a player's team plays. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know the third-best NBA power forward last season, according to TENDEX? 
The Bullets' Williams, right behind Utah's Karl Malone and Philadelphia's 
Charles Barkley, and immediately ahead of Boston's Kevin McHale. Eighth was the 
Lakers' A.C. Green, No. 16 former Marylander Buck Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think John really raised his game a few notches last year (his third in the 
league)," said Bullets General Manager Bob Ferry, "not only in his play but his 
leadership. He took a lot of responsibility for the outcome of games, winning 
and losing. I thought that was a real big change in him last year." 
</P>
<P>
No Bullet was listed among the top 20 centers by TENDEX -- and the center of 
Bullets' attention early this season is the former eating machine, Mel Turpin. 
Bernard King was the 10th-best small forward, Jeff Malone the 15th-best 
shooting guard and Darrell Walker the 16th-best point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Our two position (with Malone and Ledell Eackles combining for an average of 
33.2 points per game) was more solid than any in the league," Ferry said. 
"Eackles is a great offensive rebounder for a two-guard." 
</P>
<P>
In 1,100 fewer minutes, Eackles had just 33 fewer offensive rebounds than King. 
</P>
<P>
TENDEX also had Wes Unseld as coach of the year, insisting the Bullets won 12 
more games than their talent indicated. The surprise was who finished second: 
Chuck Daly, coach of the league champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons might go 79-3 during this regular season and win every playoff game 
by more than 15 points; going in, I still don't think they're anything special. 
Deserving of last season's title, but the worst champion since '78-79 Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
TENDEX said Daly meant 11 games to the Pistons last regular season; I say 
several teams are capable of easing by his gang in the Eastern Conference 
playoffs -- and if one of them doesn't, the Bulls will. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most-improved team might be Indiana," Ferry said. "Cleveland opens 
the season devastated by injuries (to Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance). The 
Knicks are somewhat of a mystery team, with a new coach (Stu Jackson) and Kiki 
Vandeweghe out for a while (with a back injury). Injuries are part of the game, 
but they can destroy the best of teams. Boston proved that last year." 
</P>
<P>
Birdless, the Celtics only avoided the lottery on the last day of the regular 
season. And Magic Johnson's hamstring injury assured the Pistons of the NBA 
title they may have deserved a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 seasons, counting college, basketball still belongs to Magic and Bird. 
Until Michael Jordan and a much-improved cast of Chicago Bulls overtakes them 
at the start of a new decade. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bulls have going for them is lots of young talent and time to get it 
accustomed to Jordan and the league (the regular season ends April 22). B.J. 
Armstrong is good enough to allow Jordan to move from point to shooting guard 
and Stacey King should become an inside presence. 
</P>
<P>
With Bird, the Celtics might rise to first once more in the Atlantic Division. 
Without him last season, the Celtics were winless in 23 road games against 
teams that finished .500 or better. 
</P>
<P>
A team that also commands attention is San Antonio, with David Robinson finally 
starting to earn the $26 million that ownership began paying him two years ago. 
Robinson gets to bang six regular-season times with the best center -- by a lot 
-- in the NBA, Akeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
A most appealing player is the Soviet sharpshooter for Golden State, Sarunas 
Marchiulionis, who was among the first to volunteer his services to earthquake 
victims in his new home. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets' ad in basketball personals would be: "Desperately Seeking Center." 
Theirs would not be the only one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's always been that way," Ferry said. "I think there's always been a 
scarcity of big people with above-average talent. If you can get a big person 
who can even play a role, he's worth a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to the 7-foot Koncak with the Hawks. And the stunning 
reality that to the 76ers the former Bullet with a troublesome back, Rick 
Mahorn, is worth a first-round draft pick and two No. 2s.

TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
In the showdown between Garden Grove League's premier running backs, county 
rushing leader Dana Riddle rushed for a school-record 374 yards and two 
touchdowns in 52 carries, the third best rushing total in county history. Chris 
Shockley gained 109 yards in 24 carries. But Shockley's Pacifica team prevailed 
over Rancho Alamitos, 41-14. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pizula rushed for 146 yards and scored on runs of 10, 11 and 30 yards to 
lift unbeaten Sunny Hills to a 40-0 Freeway League victory over Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana quarterback Jesse Rosas outgained the entire Foothill offense, 
passing for 105 yards and rushing for 62 in a 21-6 Century League victory. 
Foothill had only 153 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica defensive back Derrick Nicholson returned a fumble 90 yards for a 
touchdown and returned an interception 83 yards for another score in a 41-14 
rout of Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Cicero had three sacks to help Newport Harbor rally from a 10-point 
deficit in a 27-17 Sea View League victory over Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ODDS AND ENDS 
</P>
<P>
Out Go the Lights: Two weeks ago, Bishop Amat's homecoming game against Bishop 
Montgomery was spoiled when newly installed lights short circuited the 
stadium's electrical system, canceling the game. Fans were given rain tickets 
and the game was rescheduled the next night. "We thought it was going to be a 
disaster, but we actually made another $1,700 in ticket receipts the next night 
in addition to the tickets we sold on Friday," said Mark Paredes, Bishop Amat 
athletic director and football coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
One losing streak ended, another continued when Laguna Beach met Costa Mesa in 
a battle to avoid last place in the Pacific Coast League. Laguna Beach's Sean 
Mallet rushed for 153 yards and two touchdowns in 27 carries as the Artists 
won, 23-13, for their first victory of the season. Costa Mesa dropped to 0-9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man, I'm happy. When I got here they told me I had 10 kids on my team, no 
weight room and no coaches, because they all quit. We got our butts kicked for 
two years, we went two and 18. But in the last two seasons we've gone 16-3-1, 
and it's because these kids did the work, they ran and pumped weights when all 
their friends were at the beach and having fun. It wasn't fun for them back 
then, but this, this is fun." -- John Liebengood, Estancia coach, after his 
team's 17-12 victory over Tustin clinched the Sea View League championship, its 
first league title in football in 10 years.

SANTA ANA'S DEFENSE HUMBLES FOOTHILL

<P>
With a share of the Century League lead on the line, Santa Ana and Foothill 
high schools played a rough and tumble game Friday. Santa Ana got rough and 
Foothill tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
The Saint defense was in top form, while the offense picked its spots in a 21-6 
victory in front of 3,000 at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept alive the Saints' hopes of a fourth consecutive league 
championship. They will be no worse than tied for first place with either Villa 
Park or Santa Ana Valley, who play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the fourth consecutive year that Santa Ana (7-2 overall, 3-1 in 
league play) had defeated Foothill. Only a week ago, the Knights (4-5, 2-2) 
were on top of the league with a 2-0 record, but back-to-back losses to Santa 
Ana Valley and Santa Ana have left their playoff hopes in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was secured by a fierce defense, which limited Foothill to 20 yards 
passing and 153 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Knight quarterback John Shanahan completed only four of 19 passes. But, in his 
defense, he had little time to throw. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan did pick up 60 yards rushing, but most of that was gained while 
running away from pass rushers. He was sacked three times, twice by Oswaldo 
Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
The Saint defense gave the offense time to right itself after a sluggish start. 
Santa Ana let a couple of opportunities get away early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints finally took the lead just before halftime on a 16-yard touchdown 
pass from Jesse Rosas to Gus Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting nowhere running the ball," Rosas said. "I told the coaches we 
should throw more. Going into the game, I was expecting to throw more. Once we 
started doing that, everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas loosened up the Foothill defense. He completed 7 of 13 passes for only 
105 yards, but threw for 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Rosas also rushed for 62 yards, including a crucial 46-yard run that set up the 
Saints second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Foothill's Nick Sanfilippo recovered a Rosas fumble on 
the 17 and, six plays later, Shanahan scored on a 6-yard run to cut the Saint 
lead to 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill appeared to have the Saints stopped on their next possession. But, on 
third down, Rosas burst up the middle on a quarterback draw for 46 yards to the 
Foothill 32. Rosas capped the drive with a 10-yard fade pass to Octavio Medina, 
who made an over-the-shoulder catch in the back of the end zone.

Keith Gapusan caught two touchdown passes to lead Mission Viejo High School to 
a 38-6 victory over Irvine Friday at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>

of 20 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns for the Mission Viejo (7-2 
overall and 2-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (3-6, 1-3) was led by Chad Vickers, who rushed for 70 yards in 18 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, ranked sixth in Orange County, took a 7-0 lead when Snowden 
connected with Terry Kesner for a six-yard touchdown pass with 4 minutes 56 
remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo took a 14-0 lead when Mark Gaw scored on a three-yard touchdown 
run with 2:12 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>

in the first half. 
</P>
<P>

touchdown pass with 7:15 left in the third quarter.

Trainer John Sadler was in the Breeders' Cup limelight last year with Olympic 
Prospect, a top contender in the Sprint. The big chestnut gelding ended up 
finishing seventh on a muddy track he did not like, about four lengths behind 
Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the same horse and same trainer are back for a second try, yet 
they have spent most mornings this week in virtual anonymity, stabled in an 
almost empty barn in the far corner of the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind at all," Sadler said Friday. "Last year he deserved the 
attention. This year, let's face it, he's a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope they ignore him for the first eighth of a mile," the trainer 
added. "If they let him go early . . . Well, let's just say there may be a 
pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
With only two starts this year -- one impressive win and one dismal loss -- 
Olympic Prospect presents a difficult handicapping challenge. Sadler, however, 
said the key to his chances may be the lack of racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I might have pushed him a little hard," the trainer said. "He's 
always run best when fresh off a layoff, like right now." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham will get a police escort to and from the race track today. 
Highway patrolman Lester Marder has volunteered his services this week to the 
Sunday Silence camp, and he wants to make sure everything goes smoothly for 
Whittingham on the big day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this on my own time," Marder said as he watched Sunday Silence in 
the paddock Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody bothers these people or gets near the horse, I ask them politely to 
stop. I have to ask a second time, they go for a ride in my car." 
</P>
<P>
For his unusual moonlighting, Marder will be getting a photograph of him 
feeding Sunday Silence a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, just being around this horse is a once-in-a-lifetime thing," Marder 
added. "I haven't been to a Kentucky Derby yet, but spending time with a Derby 
winner is the next best thing." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer was the early 1-5 favorite for the Classic, and Sunday Silence was 
second choice at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Other early favorites include Caltech in the Turf at 4-1, the entry of Rhythm 
and Adjudicating in the Juvenile at 7-2, Steinlen in the Mile at 2-1, Bayakoa 
in the Distaff at 3-2, Trumpets Blare in the Juvenile Fillies at 2-1 and Mr. 
Nickerson in the Sprint at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Among the obvious early overlays were On the Line, 8-1 in the Sprint; Ile de 
Chypre in the Turf at 22-1, and Present Value at 70-1 in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris McCarron was asked if he had any advice for Kent Desormeaux, the 
Maryland-based rider who has dead aim on McCarron's single-season mark of 546 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I could tell him would be: 'Don't stop,' " McCarron replied. 
"When he hits 546 -- and I'm certain he will -- he should run it up as high as 
he can." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux got his 503rd winner of the year when he rode Nefario Cable, at odds 
of nearly 103-1, to victory Friday at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, was being pumped for the umpteenth time by 
a network television staffer looking for an interview angle. 
</P>
<P>
"What hasn't been touched on that you'd like to tell people about the horse?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I have no idea," McGaughey said. "But for goodness sakes, don't 
ask me 'How's he doing?' And please don't ask what kind of personality he's 
got." 
</P>
<P>
Sabona, one of two horses in the Breeders' Cup Mile for trainer Neil Drysdale, 
will be running for a different owner today. A half interest in the son of 
Exclusive Native was sold this week to William O. Reed of Mare Haven Farm in 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Sabona, a 21-1 shot in early Breeders' Cup betting, will run in the names of 
Sir Ernest Harrison and Mrs. Audrey Reed.

ONE TREND SURVIVES AND ANOTHER ENDS AS BISHOP AMAT DEFEATS SERVITE

One tradition came to an end while another was extended Friday night in Bishop 
Amat High School's 27-6 victory over Servite in front of 5,000 in Kiefer 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat (6-3, 3-0) clinched at least a tie for the Angelus League title 
with one game remaining against St. Paul. It was Bishop Amat's fifth 
consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Servite's streak of qualifying for the playoffs 18 consecutive years, the 
longest run in the Southern Section, is over. Servite (3-6, 1-2) has one game 
remaining with Mater Dei, but its loss to St. Paul last week means the Friars 
are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one gets better," said Mark Paredes, Bishop Amat coach. "It got a little 
hairy when we lost (Jeremy) Smith because our whole game plan was to get the 
ball to him." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who moved from wide receiver to tailback, left the game midway through 
the second quarter with a concussion and his team leading, 14-6. Smith made the 
most of his playing time, gaining 72 yards in 8 carries and scoring on a 
92-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also had a 70-yard touchdown run nullified by a clipping penalty on the 
first play of the game. Smith's replacement, Motu Ili, also posted some big 
numbers, gaining 122 yards in 13 carries and scoring twice. 
</P>
<P>
"They were by far the best team we've played," said Larry Toner, Servite's 
first-year coach. "They were bigger, faster and stronger than us. They're 
powerful and well-coached. A fine team." 
</P>
<P>
Servite surprised Bishop Amat by opening a 6-0 lead in the first quarter when 
tailback Kent Weiss capped an 80-yard drive with a two-yard run. But Servite 
never came close to scoring again. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rob Walker, benched last week after throwing three interceptions in 
the first half against St. Paul, was inconsistent once again. Walker completed 
only 12 of 28 passes for 144 yards with most of the yardage coming against 
reserves in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat's defense, led by linebackers Jason Patterson and Alex Pacheco, 
sacked Walker four times and limited Weiss to 56 yards in 14 carries.

Sean Mallet's running and Aaron Scheid's passing led Laguna Beach High School 
to a 23-13 Pacific Coast League victory over Costa Mesa Friday night at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Mallet, who plays both ways and was an All-Pacific Coast League linebacker as a 
junior, gained 153 yards and scored two touchdowns in 27 carries. Scheid, a 
6-foot-3 senior, completed 10 of 14 passes for 92 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (1-8, 1-3) also got some offensive help from wide receivers Eric 
Spraker and Eric Fegraus. Fegraus, a sophomore, caught a 22-yard scoring pass 
form junior halfback Morgan Lanchantin to put Laguna Beach up, 13-6, with 4:34 
left in the third quarter. Spraker had four receptions for 35 yards and also 
kicked a fourth-quarter field goal. Costa Mesa fell to 0-9 and 0-4. LEN HALL

Josh Ireland rushed for 107 yards and three touchdowns to lead Santa Margarita 
High School to a 42-0 Olympic League victory over Orange Lutheran Friday night 
at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
The victory clinches third place in the league for Santa Margarita (6-3 
overall, 4-3 in league play), and improved the Eagles' chance of gaining an 
at-large Division IX playoff berth. Santa Margarita concludes the regular 
season with a nonleague game against Centennial next week. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland, a sophomore tailback who carried 17 times, scored twice on one-yard 
runs in the second quarter to give Santa Margarita a 13-0 lead. Quarterback 
Trevor Yankoff's 25-yard touchdown pass to David Shearer with 1:21 remaining in 
the half extended the lead, with Yankoff's conversion run making the margin, 
21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland got his third touchdown on a 13-yard run on Santa Margarita's first 
possession of the third quarter. The Eagles went to Ireland on all three plays 
of the 47-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (0-5, 2-7) was without standout halfback Gil Greene, who had an 
injured leg.

WESTERN HOPES TO EXTEND ITS GOOD FORTUNE AGAINST VALENCIA

In the past eight years, Western High School is the only Orange League team to 
avoid a losing record against Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Western has split eight games with Valencia, the six-time defending 
league champions. The teams play at 7:30 tonight at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Western (7-1, 3-0) has won seven consecutive games since a season-opening 29-19 
loss to Loara and is seeking its third league title in 11 years under Coach Jim 
Howell. Traditionally, Western has won with a strong defense. This year is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Dan Byun and defensive end Robert Southern have led 
Western's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our defense is as good as any I've coached in 11 years here," 
Howell said. "Our secondary is the quickest group I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (7-0-1, 2-0-1) counters with the passing of quarterback Richard Wells, 
who has completed 67 of 116 passes for 957 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the high-quality running back they've had in the past, but 
Wells is one of the better quarterbacks they've had," Howell said. "They've 
been the team to beat for eight years, and nothing's different this year." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia has won or shared six consecutive league titles and has advanced to 
three consecutive Southern Section title games under Coach Mike Marrujo. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's only other high school game, Santa Ana Valley meets Villa Park in 
a Century League game at El Modena.

TONIGHT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL;

FULLERTON VS. RANCHO SANTIAGO FEATURES TWO STELLAR DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Gonzalez would do just about anything for an interception. Orlando Robbins 
seems to get them without really trying. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, a cornerback from Rancho Santiago College had five interceptions last 
season as a freshman, but hasn't had one in seven games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, a free safety from Fullerton, had six interceptions last season and 
has eight already this season. Three times this season Robbins has intercepted 
two passes in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (5-2 overall and 4-2 in conference play) travels to Santa Ana Stadium 
tonight to play host to Rancho Santiago (6-1, 5-1) in a Mission Conference 
Central Division game starting at 7 p.m. Fullerton is 2-0 in the division and 
Rancho Santiago is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Fullerton was 7-0 and Rancho Santiago 6-0-1 when the two teams 
met. Fullerton's 24-17 victory has memories, good and bad, for Robbins and 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and a teammate combined on a tackle at the Fullerton two-yard line to 
stop Rancho Santiago in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's memory is more painful. He was beaten by wide receiver Tim Imperiali 
for a 66-yard touchdown pass that gave Fullerton a 17-0 lead in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so mad. I couldn't believe I let him get behind me," Gonzalez said. 
"That was the only time the whole game he lined up on my side. I looked for him 
the whole second half but he never came to my side again." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, an all-conference player last season, is equally strong against the 
run and the pass. According to his coaches, his true talent is how quickly he 
"reads" plays. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you can't coach," said Alex Henderson, Rancho Santiago's 
defensive backfield coach. "I can't remember him making a mistake reading. He's 
the best defensive back I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez came to Rancho Santiago from East Los Angeles, where he grew up and 
played football at Salesian High School. He went to Glendale College, but said 
he didn't get a fair chance to start or play. A coach at his high school, Brett 
Daily, knew of Rancho Santiago and suggested he try there. 
</P>
<P>
He has had to alter his life style somewhat to make the 80-mile round trip each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes for some long days," he said. "But I think I made the right decision 
to come here, no matter home long it takes." 
</P>
<P>
It seems most of Robbins' collegiate football career has happened by accident. 
</P>
<P>
He was recruited in 1986 from Buena Park High School, where he was a wide 
receiver. The Colorado State coaches were watching film of another player but 
saw Robbins and offered him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
His first year of college, he was moved to cornerback and redshirted. Neither 
change fit very well with Robbins, and he left after a year. He worked the next 
year, and didn't go to school. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after repeated calls from the Fullerton staff, he decided to go out 
last fall as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
But the staff moved him to free safety on a hunch, and he excelled. He played 
mostly as the fifth defensive back on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to go in and just go after the ball," Robbins said. "I'll still 
doing that. I really have to credit the other defensive backs. They all do 
their jobs, which allows me to roam around." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins started slowly this season because of a knee injury suffered in 
practice last spring. When the knee didn't heal all summer, Robbins had 
arthroscopic surgery in early August and was slowed at the start of the season. 
But now he says he has recovered fully. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a true free safety," said Al Feola, Fullerton's defensive backfield 
coach. "He has deceptive speed. He closes on the ball very quickly and has 
great hands. That's how he gets so many interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's other games, also at 7 p.m.: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast (5-2, 4-2, 1-1) at Riverside (7-0, 6-0, 2-0) -- OCC is allowing 98 
yards a game on the ground, but Riverside is averaging a conference-best 268 
yards rushing. Daryl McChristian of Riverside leads the conference with 1,131 
yards and has run for 456 yards in his past two games. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (1-6, 1-5, 0-2) vs. Golden West (3-4, 3-3, 0-2) at Orange Coast 
College -- Both teams are trying to stop losing streaks. Saddleback has dropped 
three in a row, Golden West two.

STATION'S NEIGHBORS RAP ITS WRAP-AROUND SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Silver Lake and Echo Park say they are being bombarded by rap 
music that mysteriously booms from their telephones, televisions, stereo 
players, bedroom walls and bathroom toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The music is being beamed 24 hours a day from a Los Angeles radio station's six 
tall towers atop a hill between the two neighborhoods. The signal is so strong 
that some neighbors don't need a radio to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful. It's unbelievable. At night it's unbearable," said Tanya Busko, 
who has lived in the Silver Lake area for 27 years. "It's even worse in wet 
weather. You can walk in my yard when it rains and hear the 'rap, rap, rap' 
music on the chain-link fence." 
</P>
<P>
When guests visit, they sometimes believe that they're going crazy, Busko said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the bathroom, you can hear it coming through the toilet plumbing," she 
said. "I can go in my bedroom, which has no appliances or radio, and hear the 
rap music coming from the wiring in the walls." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents grumble that the station, KDAY-AM, crows about the way its sound 
travels. 
</P>
<P>
Between songs by such rap artists as Run DMC and Tone Loc, the station 
frequently airs a promotional announcement that brags that radio is everywhere 
-- "in cars, at the beach, in living rooms, even in the shower. It reaches more 
people than you might imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of KDAY say they are getting a bum rap, however. 
</P>
<P>
They blame the problem on inexpensive, poor-quality telephones being widely 
sold and on the proliferation of electronic gadgets such as answering machines, 
cordless phones, fax machines and video recorders. Such gear often does not 
contain shielding that keeps electronic parts and wiring from serving as a 
receiver for stray radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
Station officials say they have spent tens of thousands of dollars buying radio 
interference filters and installing them at irate neighbors' homes. 
</P>
<P>
So many complaints have poured in that the station has hired a full-time 
technician to fight the interference problem, station President Edward J. Kerby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over in the artsy Silver Lake area, every time somebody puts in a new home 
recording studio I can count on losing my guy for two or three days," Kerby 
said. "We get deluged with calls every January and February, when people want 
to use their Christmas gifts -- the new VCRs and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls from people who are absolutely hysterical. They say, 'I hear your 
radio station all the time.' They threaten you with the FCC and the mayor and 
the governor. But we can only do so much about it." 
</P>
<P>
Kerby said his station has broadcast from its 3 1/2-acre Alvarado Street site 
for 24 years, focusing its 50,000-watt signal in a narrow path toward downtown 
and South-Central Los Angeles. The directional beam keeps it from interfering 
with commercial broadcasters in Oxnard and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, KDAY's rap music -- which it has featured since 1982 -- can 
sometimes be heard in Hawaii and Japan. Its reception in the hilly Silver Lake 
and Echo Park areas can be just as unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"I can turn the volume on my stereo all the way down and I still hear KDAY," 
said Silver Lake resident Maria Noriega-Petti. "I can't play records without 
hearing it. On one of my phones, you can't hear the person you're talking to 
because of it. On the other, I can put my hand on the phone and hear the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year Echo Park resident Herman Marquez said the rap music started blaring 
from his phone and television set about two years ago. "But we've never 
complained because we thought it was just us . . . hearing it." 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lake resident Francisco Duarte said he first suspected that his sister 
was listening in on an extension phone when the rap music began drowning out 
his calls. Then he found out that callers couldn't hear the music -- only he 
could. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd ask them if they heard it and they'd say, 'Oh? You hear music? Ooookaaay.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Eva Torres, who has lived in her hillside home for 25 years, thought that her 
son was telephoning her from a night club the first time the music emerged from 
her phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You're in a bar.' He kept saying, 'No, I'm home! I'm home!' Everybody 
up here has the problem. The lady across the street says she can't even hear on 
her phone," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell officials said they are fielding increasing rap music complaints 
from the Silver Lake-Echo Park area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting worse," said Ray Kilgrow, phone company maintenance supervisor 
for the area. "We get from two to 10 calls a day. We have to send people out at 
night, when a lot of the interference happens. But they can only handle so many 
cases of trouble. It is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials say inexpensive telephones built since 1984, when 
federal regulations on phone service were loosened, are most susceptible. Many 
of those new phones do not contain built-in interference filters. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission officials say KDAY fully complies with all 
regulations, however. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very good," said Katherine Deaton, an FCC specialist in charge of 
interference complaints at the agency's Long Beach office. "KDAY is one of the 
best, in terms of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Deaton said FCC technicians have conducted random checks of KDAY's 
transmissions in response to suggestions that the interference may be the 
result of illegal power boosts. No violations have been uncovered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deaton, few actual complaints about KDAY have been lodged at her 
office. Those who do call are referred directly to the station, she said. 
</P>
<P>
KDAY chief engineer Ron Russ said he buys boxes of Toroid Ring filters to 
attach to complainers' phone lines. The $8 gadgets are doughnut-shaped ceramic 
rings containing ferrite dust that absorbs the 1580 kHz radio signals produced 
by his station. 
</P>
<P>
He said an AT&amp;T "Z-100" filter also works well, although it costs $18. 
Radio Shack radio frequency filters likewise work "with some degree of 
success," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ said those most bothered by interference are Echo Park and Silver Lake 
residents -- although the station's signal "blanketing area" extends three 
miles to the south of the station, 1 1/2 miles on either side and half a mile 
to the north. 
</P>
<P>
To play it safe, people living in that area should purchase telephones that can 
be returned or exchanged if there is rap music interference. "We've had people 
with $100 phones that didn't work, but the cheap phones are usually the 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his technician will continue to filter out complaints -- which 
in the past have poured in at the rate of 250 a year.

PAKISTAN WATCHES KARACHI DECLINE INTO 'KIDNAP CITY' 
</P>

Farooq Sumar leaves the Mercedes-Benz locked up in the garage these days. The 
splendid house he worked his life to afford is now surrounded by armed guards. 
And he no longer allows his 16-year-old son to walk the one block to the local 
tennis club. The boy is driven by an armed guard instead. 
</P>
<P>
Ghulam Ahmed, another wealthy industrialist here, keeps a gun in his car. For 
his daily prayers, he used to drive to the local mosque twice a day. Now he 
goes only once a week, and with the pistol on his lap. As for Ahmed's kids, 
they are told simply to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
And Razzaque, whose Younus Brothers Textile Mills has won him Karachi's coveted 
Businessman of the Year award -- along with its 1-million-rupee prize money 
(about $45,500) -- every year in the recent past, vehemently declined the honor 
in September. So did every other big businessman in town. Thank you very much, 
he told the city's textile association, but, after all, it cost him 10 times 
that much in ransom a few months ago to get back his eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to "kidnap city." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several months alone, dozens of businessmen and their children have 
been snatched from their cars or whisked off the streets of this port city and 
held for weeks or months by kidnap-for-profit gangs, who have used the ransom 
money to further expand their illegal arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling of oppression, worry and tension all of the time," 
industrialist Sumar said recently. "The kidnapings have restricted all of our 
movements. They've turned happy people into desperately concerned people." 
</P>
<P>
Already, hundreds of millions of dollars in ransom have been paid. Millions 
more have been spent on private security guards and sophisticated alarm 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
And, with the kidnaping craze reaching epidemic proportions, Karachi's 
beleaguered police admit that they are powerless to stop it. They are 
outnumbered, outgunned, undertrained and underpaid, and the city's most senior 
police official conceded that many of his officers actually are getting a cut 
of the booming trade, leaving victims' families far more willing to await the 
kidnapers' ransom demand than to call the police for help. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, concern is quickly replacing commerce in Pakistan's largest city. 
And among Karachi's rich, who have built this sprawling metropolis of 9 million 
people into one of Asia's most important commercial centers over the last 
several decades, fear has overrun the desire to flaunt their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"The crux of the problem is the arms," said Sumar, the owner of a large Karachi 
textile firm who last month formed a citizens' organization "for the 
restoration of law and order" in Karachi and its province of Sind. "There are 
more unlicensed arms in the hands of civilians now than are issued to all the 
army and police combined in Karachi." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roots in Afghan War 
</P>
<P>
For Khawar Zaman, the city and provincial chief of police, the weapons problem 
-- and, in turn, the kidnaping campaign -- ultimately have their roots in what 
he calls "this damn Afghan war." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the decade-old civil war in neighboring Afghanistan, Karachi has 
been the key link in a U.S.-financed covert arms pipeline to the Afghan rebels, 
known as the moujahedeen. More than 1 million AK-47 assault rifles have moved 
through Karachi en route to the rebels. And many have been siphoned off for the 
local market. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, thousands of tons of heroin processed from opium grown along 
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and destined for markets in America and Western 
Europe have flowed back through Karachi, bringing huge profits for more guns 
into the city and the province. 
</P>
<P>
These profits have also helped Karachi's booming economy, but most of the guns 
and drugs have found their way into the hands of traditional, centuries-old 
gangs of bandits known as dacoits, for whom kidnaping has long been 
second-nature but confined to Sind's remote interior villages. And the rest 
went to help arm increasingly militant ethnic groups in a city that one 
longtime observer once described as "a melting pot where no one has ever really 
melted together." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the staple crime in this province used to be cattle-lifting," police 
chief Zaman said. "But now, suddenly, they found there was something far more 
profitable to steal -- and easier too. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some damn good cattle tracers. But people are a lot harder, 
especially now with all these guns everywhere. And there is now a new dimension 
of politics in these kidnapings, because there is no question some of these 
ethnic groups are indulging in it." 
</P>
<P>
Zaman said that he is certain that the kidnaping gangs are using the huge 
ransoms they have collected -- as much as $700 million in the last six months 
alone -- to buy more and more arms, creating a vicious cycle of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Already we're outgunned by the kidnapers," he said. "And the kidnaping is 
mostly because of the helplessness of the police. We are no longer feared or 
respected. We're so undermanned that we have just one policeman for each 520 
residents -- less than half of the ratio you have in New York City and even New 
Delhi. Every day, a policeman is getting killed or beaten up. 
</P>
<P>
"And there is no motivation for the policeman," Zaman added. "He is paid 1,100 
rupees (about $50) a month, and with a family of five, he can't even eat on 
that salary. So bribery is very much there. As for the kidnaping, some of the 
people serving in the police are involved. I confess that. But then the 
question is, what can I do? 
</P>
<P>
"So no one trusts the police when their loved one is kidnaped. They'd rather 
trust the kidnapers and just pay the ransom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sikander Africa Wala is a case in point, and his kidnaping last August also 
illustrated the brazenness of the gangs, as well as their method of selecting 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Sikander, who was virtually unknown in Karachi society five years ago, suddenly 
emerged as one of the city's wealthiest men, buying so many imported 
Mercedes-Benzes that he became the city's principal Mercedes-Benz dealer as a 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
None of Karachi's government or police officials will state on the record just 
how Sikander acquired his wealth, only that the tycoon has "something of an 
aversion to police in general." 
</P>
<P>
So, when Karachi's kidnaping craze began in earnest last June, Sikander hired 
four armed bodyguards to protect him. Two of the guards were standing right 
beside him when he was kidnaped near his home by a dozen men. 
</P>
<P>
No one even reported the kidnaping to the police until after the family secured 
his release, reportedly for hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom. And 
afterward, Sikander reportedly refused to give police any information about his 
captors, asserting that they had vowed to kill him if he revealed their 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
Even more worrisome than the initial effects of fear among Karachi residents, 
though, is the long-term impact that the crime wave is likely to have on a city 
where bank robberies and home burglaries also are increasing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Recent clandestine wiretaps by Pakistani military intelligence agents of 
conversations between kidnapers and victims' families have disclosed that the 
city's university students often are used by the kidnapers. Acting without the 
permission of the victim's family, the agents traced one ransom call to a 
college dormitory, where they later learned that the kidnap victim had been 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Karachi's college campuses have become virtual armed camps, where students 
openly carry firearms. Now there is concern that, with the enormous profits in 
kidnaping, an entire generation of criminals may be coming out of the 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are also the long-term economic effects," said industrialist Sumar. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the investment climate in Karachi as "very, very bad," Sumar said 
that 80% of the new factories built in the last three years in Pakistan's 
textile industry, the nation's largest exporter, have been located in the 
already prosperous northern province of Punjab -- not in Karachi, where 
unemployment has traditionally been the biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
Many more major corporations that were based in Karachi have fled the country 
entirely, moving to Canada, Australia, England and Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years down the line, you'll be able to compare Punjab to a lot of 
developed countries. Sind and Karachi will be like Bangladesh," Sumar said. 
</P>
<P>
And that economic factor has a political consequence. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiary of the exodus has been Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's 
most powerful foe, opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, who is the chief minister of 
Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic power is certainly going to help Nawaz," said Sumar, who has been 
an avid supporter of Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very complex for Benazir. . . .," he added. "Here comes 
Benazir with little power and little experience. She is trying to undo 11 years 
of martial law, and she doesn't have the tools to do so. The police have been 
ignored for a decade in favor of the army, so she cannot stop the spiraling 
crime, and the crime is hurting her badly. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly," said Sumar, "I don't see a way out for her." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, perhaps, for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sumar says he knows that he has set himself up by assuming the presidency of 
the new citizens' group to help restore law to Karachi. But he said he had 
little choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I became chairman of this committee by default," he said. "No one else would 
do it. Everyone was afraid. And, of course, this high profile is not good. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "someone had to do it."

EAST BLOC: 'TRUST OUR POLICY OF RENEWAL,' KRENZ PLEADS. HE ALSO PLANS TO OUST 5

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East German leader Egon Krenz, in a nationally televised speech Friday night, 
appealed to disillusioned young people not to join the growing exodus to the 
West and promised "far-reaching reforms" in the troubled Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz also said that five older members of the ruling Politburo will be retired 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
His surprise prime-time speech came after quick trips to Moscow and Warsaw this 
week and on the eve of an expected massive demonstration for political and 
economic reforms today in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
To East German citizens who are causing a national crisis by leaving their 
homeland, Krenz said: "Trust our policy of renewal. Your place, dear fellow 
citizens, is here. We need you all." 
</P>
<P>
He urged them to "please turn full of trust" to Communist Party leaders, and 
added, "We will not disappoint you." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz said reforms are needed in East Germany's constitution, economy and 
educational system -- all targets of reformist-minded East Germans who have 
staged street protests in unprecedented numbers in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no going back," Krenz said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reforms being considered, he said, are to allow East Germans 
conscripted for military duty to choose alternative service in hospitals, 
child-care centers and community programs. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz indicated that the new leaders are prepared to discuss reforms with every 
element of society, even "new movements," but he made no reference to any 
specific group. He said state information should be "true to reality" and that 
a "variety of opinion" is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, 53, once a hard-line security chief, has taken an increasingly reformist 
stance since he came to power Oct. 18. He succeeded Erich Honecker, 77, who had 
resisted the kind of changes taking place in other East Bloc nations, including 
the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The five Politburo members soon to step down, Krenz said, are Kurt Hager, Erich 
Mielke, Hermann Axen, Erich Mueckenberger and Alfred Neumann. 
</P>
<P>
Hager is the hard-line ideologist of the ruling Socialist Unity (Communist) 
Party, and Mielke is the minister of state security. Neumann is a deputy to 
Prime Minister Willi Stoph, whose days are also said to be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz's address came just a day after the resignation of half a dozen other 
officials, as a political party allied with the Communists called for the 
entire Cabinet to step down, and as the flight of East Germans to the West grew 
to new levels. A health official in East Berlin said the departure of doctors 
and nurses has placed a severe strain on health services. 
</P>
<P>
ADN, the official East German news service, said Mayor Bernd Seidel of Leipzig 
resigned Friday because he had lost the confidence of the people. In recent 
weeks, Leipzig has been the site of regular Monday night demonstrations for 
political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also announced the resignation of Herbert Bischoff, head of the 
official artists' union, a post he had held for 14 years. ADN gave no reason 
for his departure, but people in the arts have taken a leading role in the 
demand for reform. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the old guard after another has stepped down since Honecker was 
forced out as party leader and head of government. On Thursday, Honecker's 
wife, Margot, resigned as the minister of education, along with labor boss 
Harry Tisch, two regional party leaders and the heads of two minor political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
More changes are expected. According to the West German newspaper Bild, Prime 
Minister Stoph is also expected to go. It was Bild that forecast the downfall 
of Erich Honecker last month. 
</P>
<P>
The call for the entire Cabinet to step down appeared in the daily Der Morgen, 
the publication of the Liberal Democratic Party. This is one of the four 
minority parties allied with the ruling Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Der Morgen article made no attack on Communist rule. According to analysts 
here, it could be the forerunner of a purge of elderly and unpopular officials 
who stand in the way of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Another East German newspaper, the National Zeitung, said it is regrettable 
that so many East Germans are fleeing to the West at a time when the new 
national leadership, installed only last month, is coping with the problems 
that caused these people to flee. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt," it said, "we are only at the beginning. There is mistrust 
and a thousand things still to be done. But we are dealing with this matter 
here, not in Bonn or Frankfurt." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz had already signaled his willingness to take at least some steps toward 
reform, loosening controls on the press, lifting travel curbs and declaring an 
amnesty for people who have fled the country or have tried to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in West Berlin announced Friday that more than 167,000 East Germans 
have arrived in West Germany this year, more than a third of them illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothee Wilms, the West German minister of inter-German relations, said she 
expects the number to rise to 190,000 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
She said these numbers "show that many people in East Germany still do not 
trust the new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, said Friday 
that about 5,000 East Germans had crowded into the embassy and the surrounding 
grounds, more than doubling overnight the number on hand seeking to emigrate to 
the West. Late Friday, East Germany allowed the refugees to start leaving for 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin's city health administrator said the flight of doctors and skilled 
medical technicians is putting a severe strain on health services in East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Dr. Geerd Dellas, told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung that 1,100 
doctors and nurses have left East Berlin and that "the situation is so 
difficult that an emergency system of aid" has been set up.

E. HARLEM MAKES ITS 'CHOICE'; 
</P>
<P>
INNOVATIVE INNER-CITY SCHOOLS WIN WIDE PRAISE. BUT CRITICS CHARGE THEY AREN'T 
THE WHOLE ANSWER.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Harlem is inner-city America: where crack sells in rubble-caked lots, guns 
sound in the night, public housing darkens under graffiti, abandoned tenements 
rot on decrepit streets and tattered men just hang around. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't walk around here at night," said Allister Whitman, who supervises 
the speech programs in East Harlem's public schools. "If you walk around 109th 
Street," said Leslie Moore, director of a junior high school on that street, 
"you will see lines forming for crack. Parents are slowly dying of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, here is where the Bush Administration has embraced the public schools as a 
model for the rest of the country. The Administration looks on East Harlem as 
the shining example of the educational reform known as "choice" -- a 
tradition-shattering grant of authority to parents to select public schools for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
On close inspection, however, East Harlem appears to be a flawed model. 
Although the schools have instilled a new exuberance and spirit of learning, 
the claims about the impact of choice on educational achievement may be 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
East Harlem school officials, in a boast frequently echoed by the Bush 
Administration, say that reading scores have improved sharply in the last 15 
years. They do not say what the statistics also show: that the improvements in 
reading scores seem to result from other factors -- a citywide improvement in 
reading levels, for example, and a switch to a different standardized test -- 
that have nothing to do with choice. Nor is there any evidence that choice has 
dented the dropout and illiteracy rates of the school district in any way. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the elementary and junior high schools of East Harlem are in fact 
a cluster of oases in the inner city of New York. A near-wondrous pride has 
infused the schools since the district started 15 years ago to institute a 
series of reforms, including giving parents some choice as to the school their 
children will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best school in the world," shouted a youngster to a visitor the 
other day in front of Junior High School 45 on First Avenue. The spirit is 
determined and infectious. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, frequently citing East Harlem, has called choice "perhaps the 
single most promising" idea for reforming education in America. Education 
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, once lukewarm about the idea, now proclaims that 
"choice is the cornerstone of educational change." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, opening a nationwide campaign to sell choice, held a 
two-day conference in East Harlem in mid-October that turned into an emotional 
celebration of the neighborhood's schools. The Administration has already held 
a second regional conference in Minneapolis, and it plans additional sessions 
this month in Charlotte, N.C., Denver and Richmond, Calif. -- all areas where 
schools allow choice. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other school districts has had as much experience with choice as 
East Harlem. Nor has any offered quantified documentation of its educational 
results. 
</P>
<P>
In the most extensive experiment, the state of Minnesota allowed all students 
beginning this school year to transfer to any school in the state so long as 
the move did not upset the racial balance of schools under court desegregation 
orders. So far, 3,500 students -- 0.5% of all children in Minnesota's public 
education system -- have chosen to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, which has conducted California's most extensive experiment, has 
encouraged parents since 1987 to choose schools best suited to their children. 
To attract children this school year, Richmond transformed 48 of its 50 schools 
into specialty schools concentrating on such fields as international affairs or 
classical studies. 
</P>
<P>
For some years, Los Angeles and other California school districts have also 
provided "magnet schools" designed to attract students citywide into an ethnic 
mix -- a kind of precursor of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives favor choice because, apart from not costing any money, it seems 
to apply the rules of free markets to public education. Thomas Sobol, who as 
New York state education commissioner is skeptical about the concept, says the 
conferences on choice "have the air of revival meetings." 
</P>
<P>
In a passionate plea at the East Harlem conference, Republican Gov. Thomas Kean 
of New Jersey likened traditional American school systems to the meager goods 
on the shelves of groceries in the Soviet Union. After describing his glimpses 
of dispiriting shops on a recent Soviet visit, Kean asked: "How different is it 
from the way we run the most important government-run industry in this 
country?" 
</P>
<P>
Choice's opponents are just as ideologically fervent. Barbara Dandridge, 
administrative assistant to the House Education and Labor Committee, accused 
the Education Department of "going around the country selling snake oil. Do we 
really want to subject our children to the dog-eat-dog atmosphere of the 
marketplace?" 
</P>
<P>
Sobol warned: "We must not simply think that an open market alone will create 
quality -- unless we believe that MTV and shopping malls are the highest 
quality that we can produce." 
</P>
<P>
No American school district has practiced choice longer than East Harlem. And 
no one can accuse the officials, teachers and parents of East Harlem -- a 
liberal bastion of the Democratic Party -- of blinding themselves with their 
fervor for conservative philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The schools of District 4, as the East Harlem area is officially designated, 
were in a woeful, depressing state two decades ago. Leslie Moore, who came from 
Buffalo as an art teacher in 1968, recalled: "It was not uncommon to see chairs 
go out the window. It was not uncommon to refuse to turn your back on the 
children. It was not a safe environment. I was totally upset, frustrated and 
discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
John Falco, now assistant superintendent of the district, said absenteeism was 
rampant, not only among students but teachers as well. "If we had 80% 
attendance by pupils on any day, we were ecstatic," he said. "We had a junior 
high school with 120 teachers. If we had as few as 20 absent on any given day, 
we were excited." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Moore and a few other teachers persuaded Anthony Alvarado, 
the young, dynamic superintendent of the district, to try a few new programs 
that might attract youngsters and infuse the system with some creativity and 
discipline. "We took risks," recalled Bernard Diamond, now principal of Public 
School 117, "because we had nowhere to go but up." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado started three alternative schools in the 1973-1974 school year: a 
performing arts school, a school for difficult students and what teachers call 
an "open education" school, where students work at their own individual pace in 
an environment that looks less structured than the traditional classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, teachers were encouraged to propose different kinds of schools 
that might interest the district's torpid youngsters. Seymour Fliegel, who was 
deputy superintendent during much of this period, said: "Our message to 
teachers was: 'Come forth with your ideas. Tell us what your dreams are. We'll 
put you into business.' Well, they did." 
</P>
<P>
The district also started "magnet" schools with specialized, high-quality 
programs that could attract bright students from all over the city. By 1982, 
district officials felt there were so many good junior high schools with so 
many different programs that parents could choose the one most suitable for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have much less choice about where to send their children to elementary 
school. There are five magnet elementary schools for bright children, but 
children not admitted to these schools are assigned to the closest of the 28 
regular schools. 
</P>
<P>
The East Harlem school board now runs 52 small elementary and junior high 
schools in 20 school buildings in the district, which extends from 96th Street 
to 125th Street on the east side of Central Park. All the schools are small, 
and the massive old junior high school buildings house as many as five separate 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14,000 students, 60% are Latino and 35% are black. Those living in East 
Harlem come from families with a median income of $8,300 a year, the lowest in 
Manhattan. More than one-third of the families are on welfare. There are 1,500 
students who travel to East Harlem from outside the district to attend the 
magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
At the junior high school level, students choose from a menu of 19 schools, 
which include not only traditional schools but also an academy of environmental 
science, a maritime school, two schools with private college prep atmosphere, a 
college for human services, a school for health and biomedical studies, a 
technical school, two performing arts schools, a school for math and science, a 
school for science and humanities, a school for underachievers, a music school, 
a technical school for communication arts and computer science and a bilingual 
school with Spanish and English classes. 
</P>
<P>
Not all students get their first choice. Several schools have more applicants 
than places and select students after interviews and examination. Elementary 
school teachers look for underachievers who have potential and push them to the 
Key School, a small junior high with a staff trained to help such children. The 
district has 1,000 other children -- classified as "at risk" -- who have fallen 
so far behind that they cannot attend regular classes but must be enrolled in 
what New York officials call "special education." 
</P>
<P>
These innovations have set off giddy changes in the mood of District 4. 
Assistant Superintendent Falco says student attendance is now well over 90% and 
teacher morale is so high that teachers throughout the city are trying to 
transfer to East Harlem. The atmosphere is warm and vibrant. 
</P>
<P>
Pride abounds. Sharabee Briscoe, a ninth-grader at the Key School for 
underachievers, brassily showed off her classrooms recently, tossing off glib 
judgments, mostly favorable, about her teachers. "I used to be failing, getting 
60s," she said. "Then I came here. I got 75s, then 85s. Now I'm doing 90s." 
</P>
<P>
Isidore Bernstein, the principal of Junior High School 45 on First Avenue, 
which houses a regular junior high school, the East Harlem Center for Health 
and Bio-Medical Studies, the Communications Arts Center, the East Harlem 
Maritime School and the Rafael Cordero Bilingual School, says some students are 
so happy to be in their school that they walk 20 blocks to reach it every 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty blocks isn't a big thing in terms of Abraham Lincoln," Bernstein says. 
"But when you walk across East Harlem, you walk across turfs. Five blocks is 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
Parents in inner cities usually pay scant attention to schools. They are too 
busy trying to struggle for a living or too uninterested or too frightened of 
government and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
But choice has encouraged the parents of East Harlem to take extraordinary 
interest. They feel so possessive about the schools that they seem to hover 
over them, often helping out teachers as volunteer aides. 
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Cavazos discovered the intense interest of the parents 
rather unexpectedly one uncomfortable evening at the recent conference when 
parent after parent, some speaking English and some speaking Spanish, berated 
him and the federal government for refusing to give East Harlem a $1.4-million 
grant for magnet schools this year. 
</P>
<P>
But, while the mood is easy to sense, the academic achievement is harder to 
document. 
</P>
<P>
Every federal government publication describing the East Harlem schools cites a 
single dramatic statistic to prove the worth of choice. In 1974, only 15.3% of 
the students in District 4 could read at or above the norm for their grade 
level. In 1988, the proportion had quadrupled to 62.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, although true, are misleading. District 4 achieved its largest 
increases in reading in 1975 (13 percentage points), when the choice program 
was just barely getting under way, and in 1986 (9.5 percentage points), when 
New York City changed its reading test. All schools in New York achieved 
similar increases in reading level in those same years. 
</P>
<P>
If reading levels are measured from 1981, the year before choice was officially 
inaugurated in East Harlem, the results are still favorable. In that year, 
44.3% of the pupils of District 4 were reading at their grade level or better. 
</P>
<P>
The 62.5% of 1988 represents substantial improvement. But the percentage of all 
students of New York City public schools who read at grade level or better 
increased from 50.8% in 1981 to 65% in 1988, a nearly equal increase. The 
somewhat better results achieved by District 4 could be accounted for by the 
large numbers of students -- more than one out 10 -- who attend East Harlem 
magnet schools from outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, District 4 officials have no records about what happens to their 
students once they go on to high schools, which are run by the citywide board 
of education. They can offer no documentary evidence that they have reduced the 
dropout rate in East Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
Scandal has tainted the district. Alvarado's record as superintendent was so 
impressive that New York named him chancellor of the entire city school system 
in 1983. A year later, however, he had to resign when accused of financial 
impropriety -- mainly borrowing money from people working under him when he 
headed the schools in District 4. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Medina, Alvarado's successor as superintendent of District 4, was forced 
to resign last December when he and other officials were accused of using a 
school fund to pay for personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these scandals have evidently not diminished the ardor of parents for their 
"schools of choice" in District 4, a measure of the extraordinary popularity of 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Principals and teachers have turned around a system that would have gnarled the 
spirit of even the brightest of youngsters. Choice may not be so responsible as 
the intimacy that the small schools have achieved and the soaring spirits that 
they have spawned among both students and teachers. Regardless, the reforms 
have encouraged the potential of students who might have been intimidated by 
the chaos of the old schools. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent school day, Nelda Rios, director of the Rafael Cordero Bilingual 
School, hugged a young boy who came from the Dominican Republic a year ago and 
has now graduated to the highest English class. "We are here to serve people 
like Maximo," she said. "They are very bright, and we don't want children like 
him to fall by the way."

<P>
But they could never be accused of being unpatriotic for making the flags of 
the Islamic Republic's No. 1 enemy, the United States. 
</P>

One hundred and sixty U.S. flags are due to be ritually burned in Tehran today 
during celebrations to mark the 10th anniversary of the seizure of the American 
embassy in the Iranian capital.

"Burning U.S.flags has become a national pastime," said a Middle East-based

<P>
Ten years after Islamic militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and made 
hostages a cruel symbol of Middle East politics, Iran will mark the anniversary 
today with an orchestrated outpouring of anti-American rage. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, as on previous anniversaries of the takeover, radicals will march 
down Taleghani Avenue to the iron gates of the embassy compound, now a military 
school of the Revolutionary Guards, chanting, "Marg bar Amerika" -- "Death to 
America" -- before invited representatives of the foreign press. 
</P>
<P>
"The dismay and shame resulting from this humiliation will always remain on the 
face of the oppressor ringleaders of the United States," the Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei declared this week as the radical fervor moved toward crescendo. 
Khamenei was named Iran's spiritual leader last summer after the death of the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic revolution and the man who 
branded Washington "the Great Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstrations will include the burning of American flags and the 
opening, on the former embassy grounds, of a five-day exhibition of documents 
and other purported evidence of U.S. espionage in Iran. Military men accused of 
taking part in a U.S.-organized spy ring will be presented to the foreign 
press. 
</P>
<P>
The 160 flags put to the torch will commemorate 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Muslims 
beheaded two months ago by Saudi Arabia on charges of planting bombs in 
connection with this year's pilgrimage to Mecca. The Saudis accused Iran of 
ordering the terrorist incident, and Tehran authorities have labeled it a 
U.S.-Saudi plot. 
</P>
<P>
Seizure of the embassy created a political gulf between Washington and Tehran 
in the first months of the revolution that drove U.S.-backed Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi from power. The remaining year of President Jimmy Carter's term was 
scarred by the takeover of what student captors called "a den of spies." 
</P>
<P>
Iran Television released a steady barrage of film clips of the 52 captive 
diplomats and military men. A U.S. rescue raid collapsed in disaster at the 
staging point called Desert 1, and a spiritual leader deepened the wound by 
gleefully poking at the remains of American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages were finally released after 444 days of captivity, on the day 
Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as President. Iranian leaders still crow over the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
"Its main thrust was that the colossal empire of wealth, might and deception 
which pushed around nations and their leaders . . . was itself humiliated," 
Khamenei declared in remarks monitored in Nicosia. "The world was shown that 
the power of the bullies is not absolute." 
</P>
<P>
However, the embassy takeover served to ostracize the Khomeini regime among 
Western nations, and Khomeini's pledge to export fundamentalist Islam raised 
opposition in neighboring Muslim states. Iran's decade-long war with Iraq saw 
Arab nations, with few exceptions, pledging solidarity and providing funds to 
their brother government in Baghdad in the struggle against non-Arab Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Khomeini left the Iranian leadership in rival camps of pragmatists 
and radicals. Today's activities at the embassy are a radical show. The 
Militant Clergy Assn. of Tehran has taken the lead in organizing the program, 
which it said in a statement would be conducted "more fervently than in the 
past so that the last hopes of our enemies are crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, a major speaker will be Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the hard-line 
former interior minister dropped by pragmatist President Hashemi Rafsanjani 
from his new government. Mohtashemi had not been seen in recent weeks and was 
once rumored to be under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview made public Friday by the official Islamic Republic News 
Agency, Mohtashemi said he had been on a visit to Lebanon. He did not disclose 
the reason for his trip or his itinerary, but the bearded cleric is known to 
maintain close relations with fundamentalist Shiite groups in Lebanon, 
including Hezbollah, the umbrella organization whose radical factions are 
believed to hold foreign hostages there, including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In the news service interview, Mohtashemi denied reports of a power struggle 
between the two leadership camps, saying: "Conservative or extremist in the 
Western sense of the words are just alien expressions in Islam. When a common 
enemy is concerned, a Muslim has just one single outlook." 
</P>
<P>
While no Iranian leader speaks ill of the embassy seizure, Rafsanjani, in a 
Tehran press conference two weeks ago, commented on today's anniversary with 
less fervor than has been heard from the radicals this week in Tehran. He 
called the takeover "an important incident . . . an important decision." 
</P>
<P>
In his evident desire to improve relations with the West for help in rebuilding 
Iran's war-devastated economy, Rafsanjani has found himself dogged by the issue 
of hostages -- in this case those held by pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiites -- and a 
legacy of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy. In response to the takeover, 
then-President Carter froze Iranian assets in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In last summer's hostage crisis in Beirut, Washington sent word to Tehran 
asking for Iranian help. Rafsanjani responded positively but sent signals back 
that the Bush Administration should offer a sign of good will, mentioning 
specifically the impounded funds.

COUP LEADERS LEFT NORIEGA WITH PHONE, WEBSTER SAYS 
</P>

CIA Director William H. Webster said Friday that last month's abortive attempt 
to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega failed because its leaders, 
thinking that they could have "an old-fashioned coup where people don't have to 
be hurt," left Noriega alone in a bedroom where he telephoned his mistress and 
other supporters to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say . . . maybe that's what went wrong," he said. "They planned to 
do it themselves. They wanted a Panamanian solution. It was kind of an 
idealistic approach to their problems where people don't have to get hurt, 
where you go in and take over the headquarters. They did not want anything to 
happen to Noriega. They wanted him to be able to retire in dignity." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with journalists at the Washington Post on Friday, Webster said 
there had been no "intelligence failure that would have affected (President 
Bush) or denied him something that he needed to know" before the Oct. 3 coup 
attempt by dissident officers of the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The plotters gave U.S. officials 24 hours' notice of their intentions, he said, 
although there initially was some doubt among U.S. policy-makers about whether 
the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, could be trusted. Giroldi, who was killed 
after Noriega's rescue by loyalists, had been instrumental in foiling a 1988 
attempt to depose the Panamanian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega's very crafty, and (U.S. officials) thought they might be getting set 
up for some kind of embarrassment, and they wanted to proceed very slowly," 
Webster recalled. "So there's naturally some anxiety about who we are dealing 
with." 
</P>
<P>
However, Webster continued, the CIA's people in Panama reported to Washington 
that they believed Giroldi "was sincere and that he had a less than even chance 
of succeeding because his plan wasn't very well thought out." 
</P>
<P>
As described by Webster, Giroldi's plan essentially involved seizing Noriega at 
the defense forces headquarters and forcing him and other senior officers to 
accept retirement. Noriega's retirement would have been retroactive to August, 
1988, the date he had completed 25 years of service in the defense forces. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said the plotters were so determined to give Noriega a safe and 
honorable exit from power that they rebuffed a U.S. request that he stand trial 
in this country where Florida grand juries have indicted him on 
drug-trafficking charges. According to Webster, U.S. Army officials who met 
with two Giroldi emissaries "asked whether they would turn Noriega over, and 
they said no." 
</P>
<P>
"(Giroldi) wanted to treat them as retired people, and I gather he sent Noriega 
into the bedroom where there was a nice telephone, and Noriega called his 
mistress and asked her to place a call or two, and he placed a few calls 
himself, and they were very good calls," Webster said in succinct description 
of how Noriega summoned units loyal to him to put the headquarters under siege 
and reverse the coup. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a four-hour event," Webster said. He added that by noon when two of 
Giroldi's fellow plotters went to the U.S. Army headquarters to inform American 
officials of the coup's apparent success "the thing was flipping. . . . They 
were losing, but the two officers didn't know that . . . Then he went back home 
and got executed. The other one placed a phone call and got the wrong guy on 
the phone. . . . He decided he would not go back under those circumstances. So 
he escaped."

AOUN BLOCKS LEBANON PARLIAMENT FROM MEETING ON REFORM PROPOSAL

Christian strongman Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun blocked the Lebanese Parliament from 
meeting today in a villa on Beirut's Green Line battlefront, but an Arab League 
mediator said plans are being made to hold the crucial peacemaking session 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies needed for a quorum were still abroad, and the meeting was unlikely to 
be convened until Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The session -- the next stage in an Arab League effort to end 14 years of civil 
war -- would ratify political reforms reducing the entrenched powers of 
Lebanon's Christian minority. It would also elect a president after more than a 
year without a clear-cut leader. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, who is vehemently opposed to the plan, reiterated Friday that he would 
dissolve Parliament if it attempts to meet to consider the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Christian and Muslim deputies agreed on the Arab-sponsored peace plan last 
month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and Arab mediators asked them to endorse it in 
Beirut no later than Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation for days that because of the likelihood of mass 
demonstrations by Aoun's Christian supporters, the session would be moved to a 
safer location in the two-thirds of the country under the control of the Syrian 
army.

ISRAEL EXPECTED TO SEEK MORE U.S. PLEDGES BEFORE DIALOGUE

Israeli leaders agreed Friday to seek additional pledges of American support as 
a condition for accepting a U.S. proposal for Israeli-Palestinian talks in 
Cairo, political sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his three most powerful ministers agreed to 
seek the guarantees but would not ask that they be incorporated in a five-point 
proposal that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has already modified at 
Israel's request, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
PLO leaders, with whom Israel refuses to negotiate, were due to discuss Baker's 
latest proposals at a meeting in Cairo today. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks would be intended as a prelude to Palestinian 
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Sources on both sides of Israel's divided coalition government said Israel now 
wants separate U.S. assurances that the Palestine Liberation Organization would 
have no role and the Cairo talks would deal only with the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Vice 
Premier Shimon Peres discussed Baker's unpublished proposals for an hour Friday 
and said later that their search for a common position would continue. 
</P>
<P>
"This effort will continue and hopefully succeed, and a joint formula will be 
submitted to the Cabinet," the four men said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin told reporters after the meeting that the final vote on whether to accept 
Baker's five-point plan will be taken in the 12-member Inner Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the Cabinet will not meet before Arens 
leaves for Japan on Sunday for a weeklong visit, leaving unclear when a final 
government position might emerge.

BRAZILIANS FASCINATED BY TV'S MAKING OF PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: IN THE ERA OF ELECTRONIC POLITICS, A GAME SHOW HOST JOINS THE 
RACE AND TAKES AN IMMEDIATE LEAD.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brazilians are fascinated by a spectacle never before seen in Latin America's 
biggest country: the making of a president in the electronic age. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the last time Brazilians elected a president, in 1960, televised 
political propaganda and computerized survey results are key elements of the 
current campaign for the Nov. 15 voting. 
</P>
<P>
And in a dazzling development this week that underlined the new role of TV and 
lightning polls, a popular television entertainer stole the political show by 
announcing his candidacy and seizing the lead in the latest opinion survey. 
</P>
<P>
Silvio Santos, 58, owner of Brazil's second-largest television network and the 
star of a game and variety show that sweeps audience ratings on Sunday 
afternoons, entered the presidential race Tuesday night. A Gallup Poll taken 
Wednesday and published Thursday showed him ahead of all other candidates with 
a 29% preference rating. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Collor de Mello, previously the front-runner in polls, sank from 28% 
to 19% of the preferences, according to Gallup. 
</P>
<P>
Santos' big advantage is television charisma, especially among Brazil's poor 
majority, which is the target audience of his Sunday show. The program runs for 
several hours, with a generous flow of contest prizes and happy chatter by the 
ever-smiling host, who is a former street vendor and self-made millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates have access to free television, but nothing to match the TV 
exposure Santos has enjoyed for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Privately owned networks, including Santos', give up 70-minute "free hours," 
every day at 1 p.m. and 8:25 p.m. for presidential campaign propaganda. 
Prime-time soap operas have been rescheduled since the free hours began Sept. 
15, and there are no business commercials between political spots, although 
networks get some tax breaks in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Time for each of 22 candidates was allotted according to the number of 
congressional seats held by his supporters, varying from 30 seconds to 22 
minutes a day. 
</P>
<P>
Political parties are playing minor roles in the campaign. And money is less 
important than in a U.S. presidential race because national television time 
costs the candidates nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily who's got the most money who gets the most attention," 
said Ian McCluskey, editor of Brazil Watch, a political and economic analysis 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The television spots generally emphasize the personal traits and popular appeal 
of the candidates, many with state-of-the-art advertising techniques such as 
computer-designed graphics. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly opinion surveys, ranking the leading candidates by voter preference 
within hours after polls are taken, lend to the campaign the immediacy of a 
horse race in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The polls are important," McCluskey said. "That's new to Brazil. It's kind of 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian television and opinion surveys were undeveloped in 1960 when Janio 
Quadros won the last direct presidential election. Only one in every 20 
Brazilian homes had a TV set then, and candidates received no free broadcast 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional, state and municipal elections have been held since the armed 
forces seized power in 1964, but no office has been filled by a nationwide 
ballot. Jose Sarney, the interim civilian president, took office in 1985 as the 
result of an electoral college vote. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the great majority of Brazil's 145 million people have television, which 
reaches every corner of the sprawling country. After a month and a half, it is 
clear that the candidates with the most time on the tube do not necessarily do 
the best in opinion polls. Former congressional chairman Ulysses Guimaraes and 
former Vice President Aureliano Chaves have the most minutes, but they are 
favored by a combined total of less than 6% of the voters, according to the 
latest opinion surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian analysts agree that the most polished TV personality in the campaign 
before Santos entered was Guilherme Afif Domingo, a 46-year-old businessman 
with a warm smile and strong stage presence. One commentator called Afif "an 
actor in search of an author," because apparently his lines have not proved 
convincing to most Brazilians: In the latest poll this week Afif had dropped to 
seventh place with 4% of voter preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Another accomplished TV performer is Collor, 40, a handsome former governor who 
delights rally crowds with flailing arms and hoarsely shouted vows to fight 
official corruption and cut the salaries of overpaid bureaucrats. But Collor's 
poll ratings had dropped from more than 40% to less than 30% even before Santos 
bumped him to second place. 
</P>
<P>
Before Santos, the latest rising star in the polls was leftist Luis Inacio da 
Silva, known as Lula, who had been dueling with populist Leonel Brizola for 
second place at around 15% in recent polls. Both Lula and Brizola dropped to 
around 10% in the new Gallup Poll that included Santos.

2 BLACKS FIGHTING TO BECOME CLEVELAND MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE CAMPAIGN IS CALLED THE DIRTIEST IN MEMORY. WHITES ARE A MAJORITY, 
AND THE TWO WINNERS IN THE PRIMARY WERE A SURPRISE TO MOST.

<P>
When Carl B. Stokes stepped down as mayor in 1971 to become a television news 
anchorman in New York, he said he thought he was leaving behind a political 
organization that would ensure that blacks would remain in power. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland, the first major city to elect a black mayor when Stokes was 
elected in 1967, became also the first in which the promise of black political 
power faded. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland hasn't had a black mayor since Stokes. Until this year, no serious 
black candidate had even run for the office since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Tuesday's mayoral election has stirred higher than usual passions 
here. For the first time ever, this racially polarized city, in which whites 
barely make up a majority, will choose their next mayor from between two black 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"This city has made some history," school board President Stanley E. Tolliver 
said after last month's primary election, in which City Council President 
George L. Forbes and state Senator Michael R. White were the top vote-getters 
out of a field of five well-known candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Like nearly everyone else, Tolliver had considered such an outcome next to 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, too, was stunned by it. "Anyone who tells you he wasn't surprised isn't 
telling the truth," said Stokes, now a municipal judge here. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the prospect of two blacks facing each other for mayor here may 
be historic, the campaign has been no less rancorous because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most observers say this has been the dirtiest, most acrimonious mayoral 
campaign in memory in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, for instance, Forbes ran a full-page ad in the Cleveland 
Plain-Dealer branding White, a former protege, a slumlord. White, who is 
married to his third wife, has also had to repeatedly deny accusations that he 
beat two former wives. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes has been attacked throughout the primary and general election for 
allegedly using his political office for personal gain. White has accused him 
of using his wife as a "front" for his myriad business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been low-down and dirty," said Frank Adams, assistant director of 
Cleveland State University's black studies department. "I don't remember an 
election like this in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The bitterly fought campaign has divided the black community to such an extent 
that Stokes said he fears it might impair the ability of either man to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Until the last weeks of the primary election, when White won the endorsement of 
the Plain-Dealer, he was not taken seriously as a candidate. The common wisdom 
had been that the vote would split along racial lines, with blacks supporting 
the better-known Forbes and whites supporting Municipal Court Clerk Benny 
Bonanno. 
</P>
<P>
But White, the most charismatic and eloquent of the candidates, confounded that 
notion. He was the only candidate who received substantial numbers of votes 
from both racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuyahoga River, which snakes through downtown, divides the city between 
wards of blue-collar descendants of Eastern Europeans on the west and the 
predominantly black neighborhoods on the east. 
</P>
<P>
White received 52% of his vote on the east side and 48% on the west side. 
Forbes, who came in first in the primary, got only 7% of his support from the 
west side. 
</P>
<P>
A Plain-Dealer poll published on Oct. 22 showed White leading Forbes 46% to 27% 
citywide with 28% undecided. The poll shows White getting 66% of the white vote 
against 9% for Forbes. Among blacks, the two men were nearly tied, with Forbes 
receiving 26% and White 25%. 
</P>
<P>
To a large degree, the outcome of Tuesday's election will depend on white voter 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing that's happened for the last 10 years will happen in this 
election, in reverse," Adams predicted. "White people won't feel they have a 
choice, so they'll stay home. That's what black people have been doing. A lot 
of voters White is counting on won't be there because they won't come out to 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
Others predict just the opposite. Forbes is considered such anathema to so many 
whites, that some predict whites will turn out in record numbers to oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, 58, is an old-style political boss. He has been a member of City 
Council for 26 years and, since 1973, he has been president of the council. 
Because of his domineering personality and his control of the city's purse 
strings as finance committee chairman, he has been a more powerful political 
personage than the last three Cleveland mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes has also provoked the enmity of many white voters because of his fiery 
temper and his use of racial appeals to galvanize black voters. During the 
primary, he was criticized for calling one of his white opponents "a racist and 
a pimp." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, though, he has spent more time campaigning on the west side 
and has tried to soften his image. He has been aided by a big campaign budget 
and by guest appearances by such national figures as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 
Atlanta mayor Andrew Young and heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
White, 38, has sought to portray himself as a unifier. He won much white 
support through his opposition to school busing. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins, the new mayor will govern a radically different city from the one 
that elected Stokes over two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Cleveland was the nation's eighth-largest city, with a population of 
800,000. Now it ranks 23rd, with 546,000 residents. Much of the middle class 
has fled to the suburbs and, as its industrial base eroded, many people have 
fled to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city went into bankruptcy in 1978, its downtown has bounced back. 
Working in close cooperation with the business community, Forbes and George 
Voinovich, the current mayor, who is stepping down to run for governor next 
year, take much of the credit for the rebound. But they also have been accused 
of ignoring the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
And many charge that Forbes, more than anyone, has been responsible for 
suppressing the growth of new black leadership. 
</P>
<P>
James Barrett, a one-time city public safety director with whom Forbes has 
feuded, accuses Forbes of "co-opting" black ministers and other leaders through 
manipulation of block grant funds. And many in the black community charge that 
Forbes, a wealthy attorney, used his connections as council president to enrich 
himself and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes denies the charges, although he doesn't deny that he has done well 
financially while in office. 
</P>
<P>
After Stokes stepped down, Arnold Pinkney, a black man who now supports Forbes, 
ran twice for mayor unsuccessfully, in 1971 and in 1975. Later, he said he lost 
because Stokes had increased racial polarization in the city during his terms 
in office. "Carl Stokes opened the door and closed it behind him," he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes maintains, though, that blacks fell out of power in Cleveland because 
their leaders became "co-opted" by the Democratic political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I left them with the only black political organization in the nation," he said 
recently in his municipal court office. "I put them each in positions of power 
-- Forbes as minority leader on the council, Pinkney on the board of elections, 
and I elected my brother (Louis Stokes) to Congress." 
</P>
<P>
He complained that prominent black leaders all left his organization to return 
to the machinery of the Democratic Party and so lost much black support. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of that era of the city's history, Adams agreed that there was much 
divisiveness, not only between blacks and whites, but also within the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
A bloody shoot-out between a black nationalist organization and the police in 
1968 in which 10 people were killed proved to people that the election of a

After Stokes' two terms in office "there was a realization on the part of a lot 
of black folk in Cleveland that a politician was a politician, no matter what 
color he is," Adams said.

A federal magistrate Friday refused to dismiss a felony charge against a former 
Cornell University computer whiz accused of planting a "worm" program that shut 
down about 6,000 computers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni claimed federal prosecutors broke an 
agreement with defendant Robert Tappan Morris Jr., 24, of Arnold, Md., by 
telling reporters that the government might allow Morris to plead guilty to a 
misdemeanor, instead of facing trial on a felony charge, and he argued that the 
"blanket indictment" was not specific enough in its charges. 
</P>
<P>
Trial lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department argued that, even if a prosecutor 
erred in releasing information, there were not sufficient grounds to throw out 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Morris pleaded not guilty on Aug. 2. He could face five years in prison, a fine 
of up to $250,000 and an order to make restitution to anyone adversely affected 
by the incident.

NEEDLE ATTACKS ON WHITE WOMEN IN N.Y. BY YOUNG BLACK GIRLS SET OFF AIDS PANIC 
</P>

Groups of teen-age girls have jabbed dozens of Upper West Side women with sharp 
pointed objects in recent days, laying bare the racial tension that is never 
far from the surface here and setting off a panic that the gang may be 
spreading the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The wounds, such as they are, have been minor. But the impression is spreading, 
with no apparent grounds, that the instruments being used in the attacks are 
AIDS-infected hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, 39 women, ranging in age from 14 to 50, had reported being jabbed 
since Oct. 24. All the incidents occurred on Broadway, between 95th and 110th 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police have stepped up patrols of the area, and late Friday they arrested 
several teen-age girls in connection with the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman, said that the suspects were all under 16 
years old and their identities would not be announced because of their ages. He 
would not say how many were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood youths have alleged that the girls involved in the attacks are 
members of a gang called the Deceptinets. 
</P>
<P>
The girls are reported to be black, and all but one of their victims have been 
white. As a result, police say they believe racial motivation may lie behind 
the incidents, and they have assigned the case to the Police Department's bias 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest victims, who asked not to be identified, said the incident 
occurred early one evening as she was walking past "a group of teen-agers, all 
impeccably dressed. Before I knew it, one of the girls was coming at me with 
what I thought was her fist." She felt a "stinging, burning sensation" and ran 
away screaming, as the girl continued to swing at her face. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is racially and economically diverse, but some residents said 
they had not thought it to be particularly tense before the incidents began. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Joseph Gallagher said the jabbings have happened quickly, with 
the attackers disappearing almost instantly. In some cases, he said, the 
victims have not even noticed the wounds until later. 
</P>
<P>
He also downplayed the widely circulated speculation that the "unknown sharp 
instrument" being used as a weapon is a needle infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in the Police Department has said anything that would further that 
theory," Gallagher commented. "Your fellow journalists have drawn that 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't freaking out at all, but the whole media hype made it into a monster 
that has its own life," agreed the victim, who said she has been assured by her 
doctor that her chances of having contracted AIDS are virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
Nightly news shows have featured interviews with victims who have expressed 
concern that they might have contracted AIDS -- a possibility that health 
professionals say is very remote, even if the weapon had been dipped in the 
virus, because the virus cannot live long outside the body. 
</P>
<P>
Women who live in the neighborhood say they are terrified. "It is no 
coincidence that I've worn my leather jacket every day this week," said one, 
who added that she is taking taxis even for the shortest outings. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents have occurred toward the end of a year when New York has been 
wrenched by sensational crimes that have had racial overtones, including the 
brutal attack on a white female jogger in Central Park by a group of black 
youths and the murder of a young black man by whites in the Bensonhurst area of 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe the panic is more reflective of the city's mood than of the actual 
seriousness of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The puncture attacks have churned up all the barely suppressed hysteria of New 
York in the late '80s, from racial tension to AIDS paranoia," wrote Gail 
Collins, a columnist for the New York Daily News.

HOMELESS GETTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: COURTS ARE ORDERING REGISTRATION. SHEER NUMBERS COULD CREATE A 
FORMIDABLE CONSTITUENCY.

<P>
The closest thing that Martin Wright has to a home is the subway train he 
aimlessly rides most nights. Robin Rickard lives under the United Nations 
Building. Lazaro Falu stays with friends when he can. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, these three citizens of New York would have been denied the 
right to vote simply because they are homeless. How can you register people, 
the city argued, if all they have to offer for an address is a park bench or a 
steam grate? Where would you send their voter registration cards? What precinct 
would you put them in? 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere in the Constitution does it limit the most basic democratic right 
to those who pay rent or mortgages, so the courts have ordered New York and 
other cities to allow the homeless to register as voters. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless still have to provide a mailing address, but often they can list 
the residence of a friend or relative, a social service agency or a post office 
box. The same system applies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a lot for us to vote," Rickard insisted. "Even though we are 
homeless, we aren't helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Rickard, Wright and Falu are among thousands of homeless who are adding their 
names to the voter rolls. In sheer numbers, the homeless could present a 
formidable constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, depending on how one defines the homeless, there may be as many as 
3 million. The Coalition for the Homeless estimates that New York alone has at 
least 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big bloc of votes," said Will Daniel, director of Homeless Voter '89, a 
year-old independent project that claims to have registered more than 2,250 in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the registration deadline for Tuesday's mayoral contest has passed, 
Daniel continues to recruit new voters, setting up registration tables at the 
city's food lines and passing out information on candidates and polling places. 
</P>
<P>
Although he receives support from many of the city's homeless advocacy groups, 
Daniel's is virtually a one-man operation. He has only a few hundred dollars of 
funding and says he is living on his savings and running Homeless Voter '89 out 
of his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard enough for most people to find the time and enthusiasm to get to the 
polls, as evidenced by the fact that voter turnout in the 1988 presidential 
election was only 51%, the second lowest in the 20th Century. Voting is an even 
lower priority for those who find mere survival a tremendous daily struggle. 
</P>
<P>
No figures are available, but most agencies agree that the homeless have not 
made much of a dent in voter registration, or in election results. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I think homeless people are turning elections around? I think not," said 
Robert Hayes, the attorney who filed the 1984 lawsuit that won New York's 
homeless the right to vote. "But there is tremendous symbolic significance in 
making clear that homeless people are not invisible." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila King, who is living with her three teen-age daughters in a shelter, 
said: "The politicians is what makes us. We have to vote for things, rather 
than just complain about them." King cited crime as her biggest concern. That 
is why she plans to vote for GOP mayoral nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former 
U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, a homeless man who registered for the first time several months ago, 
said: "I just recently started getting serious about voting." He added: "When I 
was younger, I felt it didn't affect me. But who's in office does affect me." 
</P>
<P>
He wants to vote for Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins for mayor on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not wishy-washy like some people. People like that don't need to vote," he 
added, with evident disdain for those more apathetic than himself. 
</P>
<P>
But even those homeless who are eager to vote sometimes are discouraged by 
paper work and logistics. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, for example, has moved three times since he registered, and he was 
concerned that his voter registration card had not arrived. After finishing his 
lunch at the Holy Apostles soup kitchen in Manhattan one day last week, he 
stopped by the little table that Daniel had set up outside and explained his 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony could vote even without the card, Daniel explained, and showed him 
where his polling place would be. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's wife, Tina, had a trickier problem; her first card had been returned 
by the Board of Elections because she had not filled it out completely. That 
meant she could not vote in Tuesday's election, but a Homeless Voter '89 
volunteer helped her fill out another so she would be eligible next year. 
</P>
<P>
"You be sure you put me down as a Democrat," she reminded him.

Israel Spira, 99, said to be the oldest living Hasidic rabbi and the senior 
member of the Council of Torah Sages of Agudath Israel. Spira, who was 
descended from a line of rabbis, led congregations in several Polish towns and 
survived Nazi concentration camps in World War II, including Bergen-Belsen. He 
came to this country in 1946 and played an important role in the development of 
Agudath Israel of America, a broadly based Orthodox movement founded in 1922. 
Its chapters in the United States and Canada support child welfare and projects 
for the young here and overseas. In New York City on Tuesday.

JOHN FORD CLYMER, 82; WESTERN ARTIST AND ILLUSTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western artist John Ford Clymer, who painted nearly 100 covers for the Saturday 
Evening Post and commanded five-figure prices for his sweeping historic scenes, 
has died in Bellevue, Wash. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Clymer, who lived for many years in Wyoming, died Thursday after a long 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ellensburg, Wash., on Jan. 29, 1907, the popular painter studied at the 
Vancouver School of Art, the Ontario College of Art, the Wilmington Academy of 
Art and the Grand Central School of Art. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, he was a successful commercial artist, illustrating stories for 
numerous magazines in Canada and the United States. He painted the Post covers 
between 1942 and 1963. 
</P>
<P>
From that time until his death, Clymer devoted himself to painting North 
American game animals and historic scenes of the American West. He had his 
first one-man show in 1964 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Clymer, whose works were favorites at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 
Oklahoma City, and at the annual Cowboy Artists of America show in Phoenix, was 
known for painstaking historical research, including visits to the location of 
each of his scenes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, when Clymer was in his 70s, 282 people took part in a drawing at the 
Phoenix show for the privilege of paying $30,000 for his "Water, Water -- 
Overland Astorians 1811," a 30-by-40-inch oil painting of an expedition 
financed by John Jacob Astor. The only other painting Clymer did that year was 
snapped up for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Clymer's "Roast Rabbit" was sold in the Phoenix drawing for $40,000, 
only to be resold a few minutes later to a losing bidder who paid the winner 
$55,000. 
</P>
<P>
Clymer received the Franklin Mint Gold Medal for Western Art in 1973 and the 
Gold Medal in Oil from the National Academy of Western Art in 1974. He was 
named to the New York Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1982, and was 
featured on the PBS program "Profiles in American Art" in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Doris, of Teton Village, Wyo.; his son, David; his 
daughter, Jo Lorraine Tatum, and five grandchildren.

A whistle-blowing engineer has lost his lawsuit against Rockwell International 
stemming from his firing from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near 
Boulder, Colo. Jefferson County District Judge Kenneth Barnhill dismissed the 
suit without submitting it to the jury, although the jury had listened to a 
week of testimony. Barnhill had ruled that engineer Jim Stone had not 
established that Rockwell violated Stone's employment contract when he was 
terminated in 1986. Stone is credited with supplying some of the information 
that led to an FBI raid on Rocky Flats in June and a subsequent grand jury 
investigation into alleged waste storage and disposal violations. He said he 
would appeal the judge's decision.

Two hundred students at Santa Clara University have made history at the 
138-year-old Jesuit school with a rally supporting legal abortion. The 
demonstration was the first of its kind at the university, where students 
cannot receive birth control at the student health center. Other Catholic 
universities have banned similar rallies. The university's president, the Rev. 
Paul Locatelli, wrote in a letter to the university newspaper that school 
should support the expression of different viewpoints.

BOGUS COPIES OF NEWSPAPER BEING SENT TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to deliver forbidden news to a China muted by censorship, the L.A. 
Weekly has joined in an international press campaign that is trying to break 
through government restrictions by sending bogus copies of the official 
Communist newspaper via the fax machine to support the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the L.A. Weekly said the Nov. 9 issue will contain excerpts 
from what appears to be the Communist newspaper People's Daily, the Chinese 
government's official publication. Headlines declare in Chinese, "We Must 
Unequivocally Oppose the Unrest," but a closer reading reveals a pro-democracy 
message. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly will also publish 6,500 phone numbers to facsimile machines located 
inside China. Readers will be encouraged to transmit the pages that include 
photos of the Chinese government's bloody military crackdown in Beijing in June 
and articles that provide eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Weekly's way of demonstrating its support for China's struggling 
democracy movement, spokeswoman Julie Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The fax machine has been a prime tool in efforts to circumvent censorship in 
China. The "globalization of communication" is forcing China to be more 
accountable, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Weekly in the campaign is New York-based Spy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a wonderful new form of protest," Spy magazine editor Graydon 
Carter said. Spy, known for its biting satire, is planning to devote four of 
its pages to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly and Spy are to date the only U.S. publications that have agreed to 
participate in the campaign organized by the French magazine Actuel, a monthly 
that editor Christophe Nick likens to such U.S. publications as Rolling Stone 
and Mother Jones. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Nick coordinated the publication of the bogus People's Daily with 
articles written by Chinese journalists in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The counterfeit imitates the original's red-colored logo, but in the upper 
right-hand corner, the name is translated into English as "Peking's Daily." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the headlines, the articles blast the government's suppression. Along 
with accounts of the crackdown are jokes and an editorial cartoon mocking the 
Chinese leadership, plus a doctored photo suggesting that Deng Xiaoping should 
be put on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Nick and two compatriots in September smuggled 600 copies into China. 
</P>
<P>
"They loved it very, very much when they read it," Nick said in a phone 
interview from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The French editor said that while in China he met some students who had 
witnessed the bloodshed, but after a barrage of government propaganda, they 
found themselves doubting their own memories. 
</P>
<P>
One student, Nick recalled, said: "I don't know anymore what is true and what 
is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The experience, Nick said, confirmed the need for alternative newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
In a real overseas edition of the People's Daily on Oct. 24, the Chinese 
government attacked the phony People's Daily that had been published by the 
French, describing it as a "clumsy" copy containing lies and decadent language. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel indignant," said Ye Dabo, vice consul in the Chinese Consulate in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a despicable way of expressing one's view through forgery, which we 
believe even the American public would not accept," Ye said. 
</P>
<P>
Other bogus copies of the People's Daily published here in Los Angeles by the 
pro-democracy movement apparently have succeeded in fooling even some employees 
and guests of the consulate at an Oct. 1 rally. Demonstrators passed out copies 
of both the counterfeit Daily and the Alhambra-based Press Freedom Herald, a 
Chinese language opposition newspaper that was started in June. The Press 
Freedom Herald was typically refused, but the bogus Daily was accepted by some, 
said Herald Editor Cao Changqing. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the Herald have been smuggled into China -- sometimes by fax machine. 
One Beijing journalist was recently arrested for distributing the 
"counter-revolutionary" Herald, Cao said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Weekly and Spy, participants in the international campaign 
include such publications as Face in Great Britain, Pratt in Sweden, Klik in 
Greece and Caos in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
One campaign objective is to establish a radio station that would broadcast 
pro-democracy news into China from a ship that would be stationed in 
international waters. Nick said his magazine has raised $80,000 toward the 
estimated $1-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
After Actuel began sending the pro-democracy newspaper to China, the Chinese 
government lodged vehement protests with the French government, demanding that 
it halt the magazine's activities. The protests failed. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of similar Chinese protests has not deterred the U.S. 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
"So they protest. I don't care," said Jamie Malanowski, a senior editor at Spy.

SANTE FE UNVEILS APARTMENT PLAN FOR DOWNTOWN; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: THE 387-UNIT COMPLEX WOULD BE BUILT OVER TWO BLOCKS 1,000 FEET 
FROM THE BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of downtown San Diego's largest property owners, the Santa Fe Pacific 
Realty Corp., unveiled plans Friday to build its first residential project in 
the center city, a striking, 387-unit apartment complex spread over 2 blocks 
across from the 13-story Embassy Suites hotel. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by Centre City Development Corp., the agency in charge of downtown 
redevelopment, the $25-million project, called Seabridge, would be about 1,000 
feet from the bay, the closest such residential development to the water 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Revival architecture of the building, similar to the former police 
station nearby, won praise from several CCDC board members, but the board 
refused to endorse the project outright because of concerns about the 
structure's 500-car parking garage and the lack of street-level activity around 
the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
But an upbeat Pam Hamilton, CCDC's executive director, said afterward that she 
expected the problems to be easy to resolve and that she will return the 
project to the board in two weeks, on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Among Seabridge's most palatable aspects to redevelopment officials are that it 
would be the first rental residential project in the agency's domain to be 
built without public subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
As now designed, Seabridge would cover about 2 acres bounded by G and F 
streets, Pacific Coast Highway and the railroad tracks. It actually consists of 
two buildings separated in the middle by California Street. But the street 
would be closed to motor traffic and left as a minimum 40-foot-wide pedestrian 
walkway, allowing people to stroll through the project. 
</P>
<P>
The two buildings would be joined near the roof by a pedestrian bridge, a byway 
allowing tenants to reach facilities such as a rooftop swimming pool. Sizes of 
the mostly one-bedroom apartments would range from 515 square feet to 875 
square feet and rent in the neighborhood of $630 a month, a modest enough rate 
to attract young singles working downtown, according to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Parking would be provided on two levels, with the bottom partly underground. 
Rising on top of the garage would be four floors of apartments reaching about 
60 feet in height. Seabridge's most striking design feature would be two 
84-foot-tall towers flanking the G Street entrance to California Street. 
</P>
<P>
Although both CCDC board members and the agency's staff like Seabridge's 
overall design, it will require exemptions from design guidelines in place for 
the Marina Redevelopment Area. And that is where the project stumbled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There are two main concerns. One is that some board members think that more of 
the parking garage should be placed underground, thus reducing the height of 
the street wall and placing first-floor tenants closer to the street than the 
current 14 feet. Second, Seabridge has fewer entrances on its perimeter and no 
street-level retail space as required by the Marina design standards. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe and its development partner, JMB Realty Corp., maintain that it will 
cost at least $1 million to lower the garage in the ground, in part because of 
added construction costs but also because a deeper excavation will expose the 
underground water table. 
</P>
<P>
The problem then would be possible toxic pollution, according to Alan I. 
Jaffee, JMB's senior vice president. He said there are gasoline and possibly 
other contaminants underground. CCDC is familiar with underground pollution due 
to a perplexing hydrocarbon plume of several hundred thousand gallons lying 
under several blocks the agency is trying to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said he is not only concerned about cleanup costs but also with the 
delay that would be involved. He said his company experienced a significant 
delay because of underground pollution at a Huntington Beach project and would 
avoid a repeat at almost all costs. 
</P>
<P>
It is for that reason, he said, that the garage occupies the entire first level 
of the project, though it will be screened from view. 
</P>
<P>
But some board members, such as Patrick Kruer, say they must be persuaded that 
lowering the garage is so expensive as to make the project economically 
unfeasible. Kruer said it would be hypocritical of CCDC to criticize others -- 
such as the Port District and Seaport Village -- for not building underground 
garages, and then not follow its own advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue is one of sending the wrong message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the lack of enough entrances into the project from its perimeter 
-- there are 10 instead of the required 14 -- and its absence of retail space. 
Jaffee and his architect said they have tried to design the complex so that it 
isn't a continuous blank wall. Providing more entrances would require removing 
several apartments and redesigning the parking garage. Having the garage at 
street level is what removes any retail space. 
</P>
<P>
CCDC's staff says Santa Fe can meet the retail space requirement by adding 
ground-floor shops at the Embassy Suites across the street. CCDC chairman John 
Davies, who called the proposed exemptions minor, said it is "ridiculous" to 
require retail space when there is no demand and in the face of much vacant 
retail space in new downtown buildings. Davis also said that Seabridge is 
smaller than what Santa Fe could legally build on the site.

FAMILY IN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE LEAVES TRAIL OF BETRAYAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrest of Luis Fernando Mejia Pelaez last week in a La Jolla motel room is 
the latest chapter in a four-year U.S. investigation of a Colombian 
money-laundering family whose members surprised investigators with their 
cunning, aplomb and double-crossing. 
</P>
<P>
From 27 volumes of court documents and interviews with government officials, a 
picture emerges of family members who did not hesitate to drag their mothers 
and elderly grandmother into a life of crime and just as quickly turn on them 
if it meant avoiding a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The reputed ringleaders were so brazen that one suspect who fled the United 
States waved goodby at two frustrated government agents who followed her but 
were helpless to stop her. Another family member who was arrested avoided 
deportation and a lengthy prison sentence by offering to testify against a 
central figure in the case, and, if need be, against his mother and 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Mexican authorities have implicated him in a second 
money-laundering ring with ties to the Medellin drug cartel. The Tijuana-based 
ring is allegedly run by Mejia, Mexican police said. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, Mejia, 50, had been a fugitive since 1986, when he was named 
in a 194-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in San Diego. Also 
indicted for currency violations with Mejia were his three sisters, his 
then-81-year-old mother, a brother-in-law and a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the investigation, U.S. officials expressed astonishment at the lack 
of family loyalty sometimes displayed by the suspects. Officials familiar with 
the case, who requested anonymity, called Cecilia Mejia, Luis Mejia's sister, 
the brains of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe that Cecilia Mejia dragged her sisters and mother 
into a scheme to launder Colombian drug money through several San Diego-area 
banks and a San Ysidro currency exchange. 
</P>
<P>
After months of investigation, frustrated agents from the U.S. Customs Service 
and the Internal Revenue Service followed Cecilia Mejia to Miami, flying in the 
same plane, and watched her board a flight to Colombia. The woman, who knew she 
was under surveillance, waved goodby to the agents, who did not have an arrest 
warrant, as she boarded. She remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Marguerite De Coninck, the Mejias' mother, paid a $500,000 fine and pleaded 
guilty to two felony counts for her role in the laundering scheme. At one time, 
an affidavit filed by prosecutors claims, the Mejia sisters made De Coninck 
sign 36 blank checks that were later filled in and paid to Panamanian 
corporations owned by Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
De Coninck, now 84, was deported to Colombia and given credit for time served 
at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. De Coninck was born in South Africa, 
and is a citizen of Belgium, but lives in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest case, investigators received cooperation from one of De Coninck's 
daughters, Beatriz Mejia, and Mejia's son. The pair testified against other 
members, and in affidavits implicated Cecilia Mejia. 
</P>
<P>
Beatriz said she and her sister, Cecilia, used their mother to open several 
accounts in the name of Sefanie Denis. On several occasions, customs agents 
said they followed the sisters when they took their mother to Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, where they would meet people in parking lots and pick up 
grocery bags full of cash. In one transaction alone, the Mejia sisters returned 
with a single grocery bag stuffed with $300,000 in cash, attorney Barton Sheela 
III said in an interview this week. Sheela defended a suspect indicted in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
When they were arrested, the suspects insisted that the cash came from the sale 
of gold and emeralds that came from a family-owned mine in Colombia. Christian 
Galindo, Beatriz Mejia's son and a defendant in the case, reminded the trial 
judge that Colombia is the world's biggest producer of emeralds. Although 
prosecutors speculated that the money came from the sale of drugs, they were 
not able to prove that it was drug proceeds that the family was laundering. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge John Rhoades, who sentenced several of the suspects 
on conspiracy and currency violation charges, made it clear that he did not buy 
the mine story. There was "a strong aroma but no proof" that the money came 
from drug sales, Rhoades said in sentencing one of the ring members. 
</P>
<P>
Dora Mejia, a third sister who officials said played a minor role in the 
scheme, is also a fugitive and is also believed to be in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Galindo Cabrere, Beatriz Mejia's former husband, pleaded guilty to one 
count of conspiracy to violate currency laws and was sentenced to six months. 
He lives in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A central figure in the conspiracy was Guillermina Watson, a former bank 
official who was convicted of helping the Mejia family launder $36 million. 
According to court statements made by Watson, 57, to investigators, she lived 
in Germany during World War II and claimed to have been persecuted there 
because of her "non-Aryan" appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 57, was convicted in 1987 on 206 counts of currency violations for her 
role in laundering the funds through the now-closed Bank of America branch in 
Coronado, the California Commerce Bank in San Diego and the Blue House 
Financial currency exchange in San Ysidro. Watson, who is serving a five-year 
prison sentence, was an officer at the Bank of America branch. 
</P>
<P>
The case took another twist this week when Mexican Federal Judicial Police 
arrested 12 people in Tijuana and charged them with working for Luis Mejia in 
laundering up to $70 million of drug profits a month for Colombian drug lords. 
Mexican authorities also charged the group with smuggling a ton of cocaine to 
Southern California each month. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mexican investigators, the ring laundered the money through three 
auto dealerships in Mexico, two currency exchanges in Tijuana and banks in 
Miami, Tampa, Fla., New York and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
One of those arrested by Mexican authorities was Christian Galindo, Mejia's 
nephew. Like his mother, Beatriz Mejia, 46, Galindo cut a deal with U.S. 
prosecutors and testified against Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo served about 18 months of a two-year prison sentence for a conviction 
on two counts, was fined $100 and was put on three years' probation. In 
exchange for his testimony, prosecutors also agreed not to push for Galindo's 
deportation to Colombia. In April 1987, Beatriz Mejia pleaded guilty to two 
counts, paid a $250,000 fine and was put on five years:' probation. She is out 
of prison and living in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo, 25, represents perhaps the best example of the family's 
double-crossing character, authorities say. A U.S. official familiar with 
Galindo's prosecution, who requested anonymity, described him as "someone who 
would snitch on his mother and grandmother to avoid going to prison." 
</P>
<P>
Galindo was a fugitive when he was arrested in June 1986 in Santa Ana. 
According to court documents, Bernard Voldhuizen, who was sharing a motel room 
with Galindo, hit him on the head with a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne, 
sending him to the hospital. Galindo gave authorities a false name, but his 
true identity was established and he was sent back to San Diego. Santa Ana 
police found $42,000 in cash during a search of Galindo's car, a government 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Once in San Diego, Galindo quickly cut a deal with federal prosecutors and 
agreed to testify against Watson. Now, he is once again charged with money 
laundering, this time by Mexican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It always happens this way. The government cuts a deal with these guys, and 
then they go back into business," said Sheela, Watson's trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official who worked on Galindo's case said he could be guilty of 
parole violation if the Mexicans convict him of money laundering and extradited 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Before his sentencing in the earlier case, Galindo pleaded for a lenient 
sentence from Judge Rhoades. In a letter to Rhoades, Galindo assured the judge 
that "I am sure that this tragedy will make me a better person. . . . I have 
learned my lesson, no doubt about it, the very hard way, now I am ready to 
re-enter society, I am willing and able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. official familiar with the Mejia case, "When he offered to 
testify against Watson, he made it clear that he would also testify against his 
mother and grandmother if it would help his case." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luis Mejia will have several court hearings before he goes to trial 
next year. U.S. officials remain hopeful that Cecilia and Dora Mejia will 
eventually face trial in San Diego.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAUGUS TEACHERS, DISTRICT DRAFT TENTATIVE 
PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers and administrators in the Saugus Union Elementary School District said 
Friday that they have drafted a tentative agreement to end their contract 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached late Thursday with the aid of a state mediator, 
apparently ends a tense six weeks in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers staged several protests during the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the current contract was not scheduled to expire for two years, 
passage of a statewide school funding initiative last fall prompted the 
teachers to return to the bargaining table. Jo Ann Pryor, president of the 
Saugus Teachers Assn., said the contract allows negotiations to reopen when new 
state funds become available. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give the teachers a 4% raise this year and a 1% raise for 
the 1990-91 school year, Pryor said. The increases will be in addition to a 6% 
raise that the teachers were to receive this year and a 6% raise set for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The 214-member union is scheduled to vote on the agreement Wednesday.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SNOWSHOES PROVIDE EDGE FOR DESERT-TO-PEAK 
TREK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Antelope Valley men have succeeded in a pioneering attempt to cross Death 
Valley's blazing hot salt bogs in snowshoes during a trek from the lowest point 
in the contiguous United States to the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoorsmen Lee Bergthold and Jerry Freeman used snowshoes to cross the eight 
miles of salt bogs during a grueling 14-day hike from Death Valley to Mt. 
Whitney, said Chief Ranger Dale Antonich of the Death Valley National Monument. 
U.S. Forest Service rangers said Friday they will now use snowshoes for rescues 
in the Death Valley salt bogs that have a thin crust above quicksand-like salt 
brine. 
</P>
<P>
Bergthold, 54, a survival instructor at Antelope Valley College, and Freeman, 
47, a self-employed businessman in Pear Blossom, were hit with extreme heat and 
cold, dehydration, minor injuries and a blizzard on the 125-mile trek. 
</P>
<P>
Others have made the Death Valley-Mt. Whitney hike, but Bergthold and Freeman 
wanted to be the first trekkers to cross the salt bogs. They believed snowshoes 
would allow them to slide across the delicate surface without breaking through; 
they were right.

'CREATION SCIENCE' -- AN ELUSIVE THEORY; 
</P>
<P>
EVOLUTION: FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET SCHOOLS TO OFFER 
'COMPETING' IDEAS TO THE TEACHING OF LIFE'S ORIGINS, BUT THE ALTERNATIVE WAS 
RARELY DISCUSSED OR DESCRIBED. THE CAMPAIGN SEEMS HEADED FOR FAILURE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the last year, fundamentalist Christians have waged a dogged campaign to 
persuade California's public schools to offer "competing theories" to the 
teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But in all the months of arguing, "creation science" -- the alternative being 
proposed -- was hardly ever discussed on its own merits or even described. 
Anti-evolutionist Christians rarely provided looks into that cosmos of 
mind-boggling ideas, all linked to sharply differing interpretations of the 
Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Although the strategy was carefully designed, the campaign seems headed for 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
At its meeting Wednesday and Thursday, the 11-member state Board of Education 
is expected to approve new guidelines for science teachers (and ultimately 
textbook publishers) that would strengthen earlier vague wording and treat 
evolution as a factual basis for the development of life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing on the evolution issue in Sacramento last month, board 
President Francis Laufenberg told an emotional audience that many of the 
anti-evolution arguments were useless. He cited a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that struck down a Louisiana law which had required the teaching of 
evolution to be accompanied by instruction in creationism. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Laufenberg's warning, ultraconservative Christians are still hopeful, 
however, that wording of the new guidelines will give them an entree into the 
schoolroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the board will support the right of the teacher to bring up 
competing theories voluntarily," said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the 
Traditional Values Coalition, who contended that the Louisiana ruling allows 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of the debate shows why neither side has wanted to talk about 
creationism. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, scientists, educators, mainline clergy and civil libertarians 
summarily dismiss creationism as religious speculation inappropriate for 
science classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Creationism should not be offered in biology classes for the same reason that 
we don't want children taught that the Earth is flat or that spirits cause 
measles," declared a brochure of the National Center for Science Education in 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, fundamentalist leaders advised letter-writers not to ask 
that creationism be given equal time with evolution but instead to focus on 
alleged "flaws" in evolution theory. Scientific elites were accused of 
ridiculing beliefs and hampering freedom of inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"Creation is the basis of all real science, of true Americanism . . . and of 
true Christianity," wrote leading creationist Henry M. Morris. His Institute 
for Creation Research in Santee says the Earth is only a "few thousand" years 
old. "Evolutionism, on the other hand, can be shown to be only a pseudoscience 
masquerading as a science," Morris added. 
</P>
<P>
Accusations also fly between conservative Christians. Those who disagree with 
fundamentalist scenarios of earthly origins are said to be deviating from 
biblical faith. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying what kind of creationism we want taught," Sheldon said in an 
interview. While he said he personally supports the "young Earth" scenario 
promoted by the Institute for Creation Research, he added "I know that a lot of 
churches don't understand all the (variations). I don't want to get caught in 
the flak." 
</P>
<P>
Among the variety of theories within creationism is the "young Earth" scenario, 
in which the universe, Earth and its life forms were abruptly created in less 
than a week 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. Fossils and geological layers, which 
conventional science sees as evidence of Earth's age in millions of years, is 
in reality the catastrophic result of a worldwide flood that would have killed 
most species were it not for the pairs of living things preserved by Noah in 
his ark, according to the theory. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the "gap" theory, that the Earth is indeed millions of years old, 
claim that there was an enormous gap of time before God began creating life on 
Earth. The time-gap theory was based on a translation of the first two verses 
of Genesis that biblical scholars now say was erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
In a "geocentrist" theory of creation, the Earth is the center of the universe 
-- as surmised from Bible verses. One argument advanced is that there is no 
preferred point in the universe by which motion can be judged absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
In "theistic evolution," the general framework of evolution theory is accepted 
but still requires a Creator. Most proponents regard the "days" of creation as 
long periods of time, but many also insist that science fails to show how life 
could have advanced to higher stages at crucial junctures without divine 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"Advocates of each position insist that they, and they alone, interpret the 
Bible according to proper . . . principles. Each accuses those on their left of 
denying some aspect of God's revealed truth," said Tom McIver, whose 
dissertation on anti-evolutionist ideology was recently accepted by UCLA's 
anthropology department. Likewise, the strictest fundamentalists are charged 
with being unscientific, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The leading evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, concluded a year ago that 
although a "unified evangelical position" on evolution and creation would be 
"desirable, even urgent, (the solution) seems particularly elusive." 
</P>
<P>
Falling outside those church circles are countless numbers of Protestants, 
Catholics and Jews who say evolutionary theory explains the "how" of earthly 
life while Scripture suggests the "why" of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles reiterated its opposition 
to "any attempt to interject religion and religious precepts" into California's 
science guidelines. The council said that not only would it violate 
church-state separation principles by favoring a particular religious tenet but 
also would harm the state's efforts to "combat the alarming trend toward 
scientific illiteracy among our students." 
</P>
<P>
Many conservative evangelical leaders are unsympathetic as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I have no problem with evolution," editor Herb Hollinger recently 
wrote in the California Southern Baptist newspaper. "It seems to me to be a 
valid scientific phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
At the evangelical Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, for example, "it 
would be hard to find any of the biblical studies or theology faculty who would 
hold to a creation science interpretation of Genesis," said Frederic Bush, 
associate professor of Old Testament. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to get creationism into science "misunderstand the literary nature and 
intended teaching of Genesis," Bush said. "The biblical narrative signals that 
it is largely symbolic (when) it names its two principal characters Adam and 
Eve," Bush said. "In Hebrew, Adam means humanity, a generic term, and the name 
Eve is chosen because it is similar in sound with the Hebrew verb 'to live."'

BISHOPS WILL ADDRESS AIDS, MIDEAST ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony will be the point man for two new policy 
statements on controversial subjects -- AIDS and the Middle East -- when the 
nation's Roman Catholic bishops meet in Baltimore next week. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony chairs a bishops' committee that has drafted a statement on the Middle 
East that calls for creating an independent Palestinian homeland and "limits on 
Palestinian rights" to ensure the security of Israel. And he heads a committee 
that has issued a paper rejecting the use of condoms, instead urging chastity 
as the only real solution to the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Both topics have been hotly debated, but Mahony said this week that he expects 
the documents to be approved without major change. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nation's 300 bishops usually hold their November policy-making 
session in Washington, the meeting will be in Baltimore this year because it is 
the 200th anniversary of the Diocese of Baltimore. John Carroll was installed 
there in 1789 as the first bishop in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to presenting the two position papers, Mahony will be one of 10 
candidates for the office of president of the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops. However, the present vice president, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of 
Cincinnati, is considered likely to succeed Archbishop John L. May of St. 
Louis, whose three-year term as chief spokesman for the U.S. hierarchy is 
expiring. According to the conference regulations, May cannot be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
May said in a telephone interview this week that the proposed statement on the 
Middle East was "a hot topic" that has relevance outside the religious field. 
</P>
<P>
While the American Jewish Committee has called the working draft "an honorable 
and compassionate attempt to represent the various parties' concerns for 
justice, recognition and security," the Anti-Defamation League has called it 
"fundamentally flawed." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Jacobson, ADL's director of international affairs, said a 
recommendation in the proposed paper that the Palestinians be granted " 
'territorial and political sovereignty' runs counter to American policy and can 
only retard the chances for peace." 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS statement is the most recent effort to resolve confusion that began in 
1987, when the bishops' administrative board released a paper that, while not 
promoting the use of condoms, expressed tolerance for educational programs that 
included information about prophylactics. 
</P>
<P>
The document to be voted on next week says: "It is not condoms which lead to 
good health but appropriate attitudes and corresponding behavior regarding 
human sexuality, integrity and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Some Protestant leaders who work with AIDS programs have criticized the 
proposed Catholic statement, saying it is an unrealistic and ineffective way to 
prevent the spread of the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
Other major items at the bishops' four-day meeting, which begins Monday, 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* A resolution on abortion and public policy that calls abortion "the 
fundamental human rights issue for all men and women of good will" and urges 
Catholics to "redouble their efforts" to achieve constitutional protection for 
unborn life and advance "morally acceptable alternatives to abortion." 
</P>
<P>
* A recommitment by the bishops to their 1987 plan for evangelization among 
black Catholics and concern about rising tensions over the roles and 
expectations of the 2 million blacks within the 56-million-member U.S. church. 
</P>
<P>
* A plan of action on food and agriculture that focuses on world hunger, the 
problems of U.S. farmers who have lost their land in recent years, deplorable 
living conditions among farm workers and the increasing environmental impact of 
some farming practices. 
</P>
<P>
* A speech on Monday by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of 
state, who will attend the anniversary celebration as the personal 
representative of Pope John Paul II.

AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES PACIFIC RIM INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Jewish Committee announced Friday that it has established a 
Pacific Rim Institute in Los Angeles to promote better understanding of Jews by 
Asian-Americans and the economically strong countries of the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed manifestations of anti-Jewish sentiment in such nations as 
Japan, China and Korea, among others," said Bruce M. Ramer of Los Angeles, 
national board chairman of the American Jewish Committee who was appointed the 
first institute chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Asia is supplanting Europe in economic importance and as a leading source of 
immigrants, Ramer said during the meeting of the American Jewish Committee's 
National Executive Council this week in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of changes in U.S. immigration and refugee policy," Ramer said, 
"there are now just as many people of Asian background living in the United 
States as there are Jews." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Sandberg, the longtime Western regional director for the American Jewish 
Committee in Los Angeles, was named the institute's director and will assume 
the new job full time in March.

BEAVERS MAY PROVIDE USC WITH A TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC, the front-runner in the Pacific 10 Conference's three-team battle for a 
Rose Bowl berth, takes on one of its two pursuers today at the Coliseum-- 
Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Stifle that yawn. Hold that chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Word travels slowly out of Corvallis, Ore., but the Beavers have returned. 
After years of serving as the conference's punching bag, they are finally 
fighting back. Here it is November, and they are still in contention at 3-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
It has been awhile. The Beavers are 4-3-1 overall, which may not seem like 
much, but it's their best start in 21 years. They haven't played in a Rose Bowl 
game in a quarter-century. They haven't even finished in the top half of the 
Pac-10 in 20 years. They haven't had five victories in a season in 18 years. 
And they haven't faced USC with a winning record in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is a school that didn't win a game in the first season of this 
decade and won only four more over the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kragthorpe became Oregon State's coach in 1985, but progress was slow. His 
first season, the Beavers improved from 2-9 to 3-8. It was the first step on a 
journey of a thousand miles. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Oregon State was up to 4-6-1. Few were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were picked to be 10th in the conference this year," Kragthorpe said, "and 
that's no change. That's the same as it was in 1985. It's a very slow process. 
People get you categorized. When they start to rate the teams in the 
conference, they say, 'SC is always at the top, and Oregon State is always at 
the bottom. Now let's fill in the blanks.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers opened the season with a 20-16 victory over Stanford, a team headed 
for a dismal season of its own. But it was wins over UCLA (18-17) and 
California (25-14) the past two weeks that have made at least some people take 
Oregon State seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The oddsmakers haven't been swayed. The 10th-ranked Trojans, 4-0 in the 
conference and 6-2 overall, are favored by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've been able to change opinions in Corvallis," Kragthorpe said. "I 
think the other coaches respect our program a great deal more than they did 
five years ago. But I don't think other areas of the populace respect us. I 
don't worry too much about the respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only concerned with turning this program around and having a winning 
season. I won't be satisfied until we get to that first goal." 
</P>
<P>
The key to that is fullback Pat Chaffey. When the Oregon State offense has been 
on the move this year, Chaffey has usually had a hand in it. Or a foot. He is 
both the team's leading rusher with 580 yards, an average of 3.7 yards a carry 
and nine touchdowns, and its leading receiver with 34 catches, a 9.4-yard 
average and another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith is a fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Take one guy like that," Smith said, "and you can turn something around. I've 
seen it in high school. When I first started high school coaching, I went into 
a program that had never won. We had one kid. The guy was a great player. He 
got the ball rolling, starting a winning program for the next 10 to 15 years. 
Sometimes it takes one guy." 
</P>
<P>
There's no argument from Kragthorpe. 
</P>
<P>
"(Chaffey) is the catalyst of our football team," he said. "When you have 115 
guys practicing, it's hard to bring it down to one, but he sort of epitomizes 
this team." 
</P>
<P>
How good is the 6-foot-2, 214-pound Chaffey? He may find out today when he'll 
run into people like Junior Seau, Tim Ryan and Dan Owens. Leaders of USC's 
dominating defensive front, they are not so easy to impress. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Reggie Pitchford from Compton has won the starting tailback job for 
Oregon State, and if the Beavers elect to go to the air, the offensive load 
falls on quarterback Matt Booher. 
</P>
<P>
The junior has started the last three games, of which Oregon State won two and 
tied the other. Booher has completed 61.7% of his passes for 842 yards and a 
pair of touchdowns. But he has also thrown seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The top receiver is Phil Ross, who has caught 24 passes this season and 141 in 
his career, the most of any tight end in conference history. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 75,000 is expected for the 3:30 p.m. kickoff. . . . The Beach 
Boys will play an hourlong concert after the game. . . . USC defensive lineman 
Randy Hord and receiver Marlon Washington are out with ankle injuries.

SACRAMENTO BID LOOKS STRONG; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: CITY OFFICIALS AND MAIN FINANCIERS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE NFL TEAM 
WILL MOVE TO THE STATE CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LePAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations between Al Davis and Sacramento officials made substantial 
progress last week toward moving the NFL team to the state capital, say some of 
the city's biggest financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best indications came when Sacramento City Council passed a 
$93-million bond issue that included $50 million for Davis to relocate and the 
city's finance officer was dispatched to New York to get a rating on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Riordan, president of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, said he was 
asked Wednesday to make new overtures to Davis, but has not spoken with the 
Raider owner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy who likes to keep you on edge," Riordan said. "We're developing 
more land around the Coliseum to make it safer and prettier. We have a master 
plan on security. But there's only one chance in a hundred the Raiders will 
stay here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sacramento is going to get them -- if they can pay Davis the $50 
million they promised. They've got the land and are planning a brand-new 
stadium. It's an affluent, growing area, and he'll sell out to the highest 
bidder. He may keep talking to us, of course. He'll be here for a while yet, so 
he might as well make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin said the finance chief returned Wednesday with a 
lot of questions, and she did not expect to know the bond rating for a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rudin said she and another council member had reservations but agreed to join 
in a unanimous vote demonstrating a mandate to Davis in exchange for assurances 
that the public would not be taxed to support the franchise if projected 
revenues fail to meet expenses. She said the Sacramento Sports Assn. was asked 
to guarantee any default up to about $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and other community leaders acknowledged that Joe Benvenuti, a 
prosperous Sports Assn. member who owns most of the land for the proposed 
stadium, and developers, Angelo Tsakopoulos and Fred Anderson, are the keys in 
those assurances. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz Oates, formerly a partner of Benvenuti's, was skeptical of such a 
guarantee when first interviewed last week, but after discussing the issue with 
Benvenuti and Tsakopoulos he was more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Tsakopoulos said: "Joe will sign (the guarantee); it will benefit him to 
develop the property -- it'll go sky-high. Davis will come to a wealthy area 
where there's only one other pro team to split the loyalty. It's a great 
opportunity for Sacramento and the Raiders, so it'll happen." 
</P>
<P>
Benvenuti later said: "We haven't refined it yet, but it's getting there. I 
think Al (Davis) is ready to do what's fair. He has been in it more years than 
we have, but he realizes he personally needs fan support, not just the Raiders, 
and this area will make him a hero.

MONTH MIGHT BE MEANINGLESS FOR UCLA 
</P>

The wife of an official in the UCLA athletic department, lamenting the fate of 
the Bruin football team, told her husband this week: "We're three plays from 
being 6-2." 
</P>
<P>
Replied her husband: "We're one play from being 2-6." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if UCLA hadn't rallied in the last few minutes to beat San Diego State, 
Coach Terry Donahue might be found climbing the Golden Gate Bridge today at 1 
p.m. instead of standing on the sideline at Stanford Stadium, where the Bruins 
will play the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, UCLA (3-5) still has an outside chance for a bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bruins, losers of three consecutive games for the first time since 1979, 
can avoid losing four in a row for the first time since 1971 and close out the 
regular season with victories over Stanford, Oregon and USC, they might extend 
their season. 
</P>
<P>
On a more realistic note . . . 
</P>
<P>
In all probability, this will be UCLA's most meaningless November since 1980, 
when the Bruins were banned from postseason play by the Pacific 10 Conference 
for academic transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
If USC beats Oregon State today and Arizona next week at Tucson, the USC-UCLA 
game Nov. 18 at the Coliseum will not even have a bearing on the Rose Bowl 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue's task is to find a way to motivate the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you do is, you play for fun and you play for pride," he said. 
"You play because you're at UCLA and you have a work ethic and a standard of 
excellence that you accepted when you came here." 
</P>
<P>
That's probably a lot easier said than done, of course. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, a 42-7 loser at Arizona three weeks ago, followed that with a pair of 
one-point losses to Oregon State and Washington, allowing both the Beavers and 
the Huskies to drive almost the length of the field to the game-winning points. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 28-27 defeat by Washington, the Bruins squandered a 21-0 
second-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are we kidding?" said Donahue, again addressing the subject of motivation 
as UCLA heads into its last three games. "Our players are obviously very 
disappointed and upset right now. So are the coaches and everybody who follows 
UCLA football. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are lots of teams that play every week without any opportunity to do 
anything (beyond playing out the regular season) and they play hard and they 
play well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual for us, but we have to learn to do it. It's my hope that we can 
do it well." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, though, the Bruins' confidence might be shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like all these teams know it's their year to beat UCLA, and we know it, 
too," one player said. "It's like we know we (stink)." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine how Stanford must feel. 
</P>
<P>
If not for an improbable rally against Oregon, in which the Cardinal turned a 
17-point fourth-quarter deficit into an 18-17 victory by scoring all of its 
points in the last 7 minutes 19 seconds, Stanford would be 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal has lost five consecutive games, including a 19-0 defeat to USC 
last Saturday, when it managed only 140 total yards, including minus-six on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't what Stanford had in mind last January when it hired Dennis Green to 
succeed Jack Elway as head coach, but the Cardinal has been beset with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Brian Johnson, listed as probable for today's game, has made 
only one start because of shoulder and knee injuries, giving way to redshirt 
freshman Steve Smith, who has completed 56.3% of his passes for 1,347 yards and 
seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal running game has been hampered by the absence of all-conference 
halfback Jon Volpe, who ran for 1,027 yards last season. Volpe has missed six 
consecutive games with a knee injury but is listed as probable for today. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're disappointed," Green said of Stanford's worst start since 
1983, when the Cardinal was 1-10. "We're not necessarily frustrated or 
discouraged, but we're disappointed because we felt going into the season that 
we had an opportunity to play some pretty decent football and get more wins 
than we have right now." 
</P>
<P>
So is UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wills is expected to start at tailback for UCLA in place of freshman 
Kevin Williams, who is out with an ankle injury and did not make the trip. . . 
.Linebacker Meech Shaw, who missed three games with a pinched nerve in his 
neck, is listed as probable. . . .UCLA has won its last three games at Stanford 
Stadium, including a 49-0 rout two years ago. . . . Stanford Coach Dennis Green 
is 11-52 in more than 5 1/2 seasons as a head coach, including a 10-45 record 
in five seasons at Northwestern. . . . Stanford quarterbacks have been sacked 
38 times in eight games. . . . UCLA is a slight favorite.

SCHRADER PROVES HE'S VERSATILE; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: VETERAN OPEN WHEEL DRIVER EASILY WINS THE POLE POSITION IN 
500-KILOMETER STOCK CAR RACE AT PHOENIX.

Ken Schrader, who has won six races at Phoenix International Raceway in 
open-wheel cars, took the pole for a stock car race when he lapped the mile 
track in a Chevrolet Lumina at 124.645 m.p.h. Friday during qualifying for 
Sunday's Autoworks 500. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen drivers bettered Geoff Bodine's year-old record of 123.203 m.p.h. on an 
ideal racing day. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader's record run makes him eligible for the $197,600 bonus that will be 
awarded to the next driver who wins a Winston Cup race from the pole. The purse 
has been accumulating, at $7,600 a race, since it was last won 26 races ago. 
</P>
<P>
If Schrader does not win Sunday, the prize will increase to $400,000 for the 
final race, Nov. 19 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Rick (car owner Rick Hendrick) if he wanted us to go after that 
$197,600 or just wait and go for the big one at Atlanta," Schrader said. "But 
he said to just go ahead and go for it here, that it would be good interest 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader, one of the most versatile drivers in racing, has won four midget 
races on the Phoenix mile track -- in 1979, '81, '82 and '84 -- and two in 
championship dirt-track cars -- in 1987 and last February. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of the four midget races were won in different makes of cars, and that's 
what makes the deal neat," Schrader said. "I don't know that it makes much 
difference if you're driving an open-wheel car or a stock car. What's important 
is getting laps on the track, and I've been driving out here since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea's the same, no matter what you're driving, and that's to get around 
the race track as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader will chalk up some more laps when he runs today in the AC-Delco 500, a 
Southwest Tour race. He qualified a Chevrolet at 124.783 m.p.h., faster than 
his Winston Cup car but good for only 13th position. Southwest Tour cars are 
about 800 pounds lighter than the Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Martin qualified sixth for Sunday's race, but he clinched the $30,000 
bonus for winning the most poles during the season when Alan Kulwicki, last 
year's Autoworks 500 winner, did not post the quickest lap. Martin has won six 
poles this year. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Labonte will start alongside Schrader in the 500-kilometer (312-mile) 
race. He qualified Junior Johnson's Ford at 124.559 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Only the top 20 qualified Friday, with the remainder of the entries having 
another chance today to make the 42-car field. 
</P>
<P>
Competition was so tight that six positions were determined by less than 
1/100th of a second. 
</P>
<P>
"These (mechanics) work on these cars all year and they keep getting faster 
everywhere we go," Schrader said of the record-breaking spree. "The only thing 
that can slow them down is deterioration of the track, and that doesn't seem to 
happen out here." 
</P>
<P>
The championship contenders qualified in inverse order of the point standings. 
Rusty Wallace, who has a 109-point lead over defending series champion Dale 
Earnhardt, qualified ninth. Earnhardt was seventh, and Martin, who is only 19 
points behind him, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Chase of Bakersfield won the pole for today's AC-Delco 300 with a lap at 
127.995 m.p.h. in his Buick. It was also a track record, bettering the mark of 
126.240 m.p.h. set by Mike Alexander last year. Jim Thirkettle of Sylmar, last 
year's winner, who is retiring after today's race, will start second in a Chevy 
after a lap at 126.778 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Press of Frazier Park, who qualified 18th in the 41-car field, needs only 
to start the race to clinch the series championship. Press' Chevrolet has won 
eight races this year. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Waltrip, Butch Miller and Dick Trickle, all qualifiers for the Winston 
Cup race Sunday, will also be in today's race.

Several University of Miami football players have told school officials that a

with him, the Miami Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
The agent, Mel Levine of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Levine became the focus of a university investigation into why four

companies owned by Levine. Linebacker Winston Moss was suspended for one game 
as a result of the investigation.

BOXING: UNBEATEN EVANDER HOLYFIELD MUST DEFEAT ALEX STEWART TO REMAIN IN LINE 
FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE FIGHT WITH MIKE TYSON. 
</P>

<P>
Evander Holyfield will risk what is shaping up as boxing's richest fight, his 
match against Tyson, when he enters the ring against undefeated Alex Stewart 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The bout at the Trump Plaza Hotel is a matchup of unbeaten heavyweights, but 
the word on the boardwalk is that one of them, Stewart, has fought 24 
journeymen and is in over his head against Holyfield, perceived as the only 
credible opponent for Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, light-heavyweight bronze medalist in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, 
weighed in at 212 pounds Friday. He is 22-0 as a pro, with 18 knockouts. 
Stewart, 223, is 24-0 against no-name opponents. He stopped all of them in four 
or fewer rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is most commonly pegged as a 10-1 underdog tonight, but the Caesars 
Palace sports book posted Holyfield at 13-1 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That news drew only a growl from Lou Duva, Holyfield's 70-year-old trainer. In 
the hotel coffee shop Friday morning, he pointed to his platter of sausage, 
eggs and hash browns and said: "This is my third breakfast. About three days 
before a fight, for any of my guys, I turn into a compulsive eater. Sure, we 
expect Evander to win and we know Stewart hasn't fought anyone who's great. But 
I've been around long enough to know there's no such thing as a pushover in 
boxing, particularly (among) heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
"With heavyweights, the biggest bum in the world can take you out with one 
shot. I've watched tapes of a dozen Stewart fights, and he's a young, 
aggressive guy who has a good right hand. If Stewart comes out there loose, 
figuring he's got nothing to lose, and decides to make it the fight of his life 
. . . That's what makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
If Duva eats three breakfasts before Holyfield fights a 13-1 shot, the thought 
of his coffee-shop tabs before a fight against Tyson staggers the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is a little jumpy this week in the Holyfield camp except the fighter. 
Duva's son, Dan, is Holyfield's promoter and he is in preliminary negotiations 
with Shelly Finkel, a New York boxing-rock concert promoter, for a June date 
for the Tyson-Holyfield showdown -- all contingent, of course, on Holyfield 
defeating Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's handlers seem to agree that Stewart is something like a 10-1 shot 
against their boxer, but they nonetheless see danger in the shadows -- a 
possible threat to boxing's biggest potential payday. 
</P>
<P>
Some boxing observers see Tyson-Holyfield as boxing's first $100-million fight. 
Donald Trump has the final refusal rights, negotiated as part of the deal in 
which he paid $11 million for the Tyson-Michael Spinks bout. It's estimated 
that the site fee could go as high as $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
To put that figure in perspective, Trump paid $350,000 for the 
Holyfield-Stewart match. 
</P>
<P>
But all that goes out the window if Holyfield loses to Stewart, a Brooklyn 
resident by way of Jamaica by way of London. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 24, was born in London to Jamaican parents, who moved their family to 
Jamaica when Stewart was 15. When he was 18, the family moved to Brooklyn. He 
boxed for Jamaica in the '84 Olympics and was eliminated in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Turning pro in 1986, Stewart scored a series of early TKO victories in New York 
and signed a promotional contract with Madison Square Garden. Relying 
principally on a good right hand, he developed a Garden following by stopping 
everyone put in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garden promoter Bobby Goodman, it isn't Stewart's fault that he 
hasn't fought name heavyweights. In his most recent fights, he stopped Terry 
Armstrong in three, Fernando Montes and Jack Johnson in two each, stopped 
Arthel Lawhorne in four, and Dave Jaco in one. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to the point with Alex where he needed credible opponents, we 
couldn't find any who wanted to fight him," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We offered Tim Witherspoon $50,000, and he turned us down. So did Trevor 
Berbick. We called George Foreman and he asked us to send him some tapes of 
Alex. We did. George never called us back." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose previous biggest purse was $13,500, will earn $225,000 tonight. 
Holyfield will get $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's regular trainer is Edwin Viruet, but the fighter's manager, Mike 
Jones, hired the veteran Eddie Futch to fine-tune Stewart for this fight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good athlete, but he had a balance problem," Futch said. "He was 
standing six inches too far away from everyone and having to lunge too much. 
I've brought him in closer. Also, he wasn't trying to punch through people. He 
was aiming for surfaces, instead." 
</P>
<P>
Futch first saw Stewart when he hired him as Michael Spinks' sparring partner 
before the Tyson-Spinks fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked him then, and I still do," he said. "He's a good fighter. He doesn't 
have a true knockout punch but he can batter you pretty good because he's 
aggressive and confident." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's trainer, George Benton, indicated that his man would crowd Stewart 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"(Stewart's) big punch is the long right hand, so we've done a lot of jab work 
to offset that," Benton said. "We want Evander to stay close to this guy, to 
smother him." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's last fight was on Aug. 10; Holyfield's was on July 15, an impressive 
second-round, one-punch knockout of Brazilian Adilson Rodrigues. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield said Friday that he expects to get his chance with the champion in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"From what everyone tells me, it looks good for June," he said. "But I'm only 
thinking of Stewart right now. And I'll probably have another fight before 
June, too."

PHOTOGRAPHY: SMALL CAMERA STORES FEELING ECONOMIC SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small, full-service neighborhood camera stores are a much needed resource to 
the photography enthusiast because they offer service and knowledge along with 
cameras, accessories, darkroom equipment, books, paper and film. 
</P>
<P>
These full-service stores seem to be diminishing in number, while one-hour 
photo-finishing franchises are popping up on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
Basic economics is behind this switch from traditional service to quick sales. 
The one-hour stores specialize in printing pictures, a high-mark-up item. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a tough battle for the full-service stores because they must compete 
against discount appliance outlets that offer cameras at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
Camera sales boomed in the early '70s with the introduction of the Canon AE-1 
and other affordable, easy-to-use, 35-millimeter single-lens-reflex cameras. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the sale of a camera also meant the sale of several accessories. 
But now, most automated point-and-shoot cameras come with built-in flash and 
multiple lenses. They are complete units, making sales of additional 
accessories minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The cameras are easy to carry and operate, and they produce good results for 
consumers who rarely have a print blown up larger than 8 by 10 inches. Even 
many professional photographers use this style of camera for home use. 
</P>
<P>
This trend has had a negative impact on the neighborhood store, shifting the 
business to one-hour finishing shops. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Shepherd, owner of Foto-Hall camera store in Fullerton, has seen a lot of 
camera stores go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very narrow profit margin in camera sales, virtually no profit," he 
said. "You sell a $500 camera and make $15. You can't count on the cameras only 
to carry you." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd started his business 15 years ago as a combination photo-processing 
lab and Hallmark card store. Five years later he phased out the cards for 
cameras. Today, photo processing is still a major portion of his business. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a standing joke among camera salesmen: 'Sell it at cost and make it 
up in volume.' But you can't do it," Shepherd said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the New York mail-order operations created this dilemma by their use 
of money. They could get the money in and sell the cameras at cost. They got 
the money in advance so they could use the money for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do a high enough volume and you're sharp enough in investing, you can 
turn some bucks. Some of the operations in New York are sharp enough to do it. 
They created low-ball camera sales. I don't know of any other business like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd had a problem about five years ago with people who would come to his 
store for information but buy at cheaper prices at discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Most consumers can't be shipped a box and know how to work it properly," he 
said. "Without the service camera store, the camera industry will flounder, but 
by the same token, it's the catalogue and high-volume discount stores that are 
killing us." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ventura, owner of Bill's Camera in Huntington Beach and San Clemente, says 
small camera stores haven't prospered because they can't make enough profit 
over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
"Your mass merchandisers use cameras as a loss leader," Ventura said. "The 
camera manufacturers cater to them. The bottom line is if you can sell 100,000 
cameras to one supplier. I don't care who you are or what harm it causes, other 
distributors are going to do it. I think that's basically why a lot of these 
small shops can't compete." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura also owns a photo-processing lab and a repair facility to complement 
his retail outlets. He believes this keeps him competitive on the retail end. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that has never changed is that people come in for service," Ventura 
said.

MINGLING AT THE WORKS' INAUGURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
Small private dinner at the Works Gallery South, a new art shop in South Coast 
Plaza's Crystal Court. The gallery's inaugural exhibition features work by L.A. 
artist Billy Al Bengston -- who showed up at Wednesday's fete fashionably late, 
fashionably dressed, lean, tan, relaxed. Bengston's arrival sent a frisson 
through the business-suited group of 60 or so art collectors and aficionados 
tipping back bubbly. "People like to get near the source," explained Charles 
Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Perspective 
</P>
<P>
Gallery owner Mark Moore (who bears a striking resemblance to Newport Harbor 
Art Museum chief curator Paul Schimmel) has been dealing art to locals from his 
gallery in Long Beach for six years. "They came to Long Beach, but they'd 
rather not," said the 32-year-old Irvine native of his southern expansion. 
"People who live in Orange County are more convenience-oriented than in other 
markets." Browsing the brightly colored exhibit, guest Norma Glover dubbed the 
new space "the best contemporary art gallery in the county." The competition 
being? "Well, um, let's see," Glover said, brow furrowing. "Oh yes, I can think 
of one other -- but I'm not naming names." Early arrivals Lori and Mike Paselk 
hovered near a small gold-toned piece called "Telegraph Trail," the newest 
addition to their personal collection. "This one came out of the box and into 
my hands," said Paselk, a friend of Moore and the commercial contractor who 
built the gallery space. "Our little prize," said his wife, gazing adoringly at 
their $28,000 purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Motif 
</P>
<P>
She's the boss. Ask Herb Brownell, a retired Laguna Beach architect, about his 
art collection: "My wife is the collector. Aesthetically I'm thrilled. 
Financially I bleed." Ask Newport Beach lawyer Philip Gold: "I had a couple of 
Bengstons when I was married, formerly, a couple of nice pieces. (My ex) got 
them. But I have a good sense of humor, so I'm here tonight." Ask Larry Deane, 
a Newport Beach developer: "Talk to the boss over there," he said, nodding 
toward his wife. "I enjoy what I enjoy, but when it comes to the decisions, I 
just snap and salute." 
</P>
<P>
Notables 
</P>
<P>
The hot spots at dinner went to Jack and Marion Shea and David and Margarita 
Steinmetz -- the Sheas seated to the left and the Steinmetzes to the right of 
Bengston and his "goodest friend," as he put it, Christi Bach. Asked if he 
collected Bengston, Shea laughed. "I gave the best one we had to the (Newport 
Harbor Art Museum), and my wife's never forgiven me." ("Absolutely right," said 
Marion, casting a glance at the next table, where Paul Schimmel sat with his 
associate curator, Lucinda Barnes. "Paul's loaning it back real soon -- like on 
Monday.") Artist Ed Ruscha and his wife, Danna, and L.A. gallery owner Jim 
Corcoran flew down with Bengston and Bach. (Yes, globe-trotters, that's Santa 
Monica to John Wayne by air, then a limo to the gallery. And still an hour late 
-- thanks to a pilot who headed north for 25 miles and a limo driver who took 
"back roads," according to Bengston, who clocked the last leg of the journey at 
18 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Edibles 
</P>
<P>
Dinner was catered by mall neighbor Bangkok Four, an elegant presentation that 
included Belgian endive appetizer, green salad, baked prawns, fresh fruit and 
pineapple sorbet. Washed down with Chardonnay and Thai coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted 
</P>
<P>
Of mingling with patrons, Bengston said: "You just have to relax and see what 
happens. Sometimes it's a good time and sometimes it's hell. I can name a 
couple of parties that were worse than hell." PAMELA MARIN

HUNTER ENJOYED 'JOY RIDE' WITH DOMINELLI, U.S. PROSECUTOR CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter was intimately involved in the giant fraud perpetrated by 
the failed La Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co., knew about it at every 
step along the way, and created false documents to lure investors, a federal 
prosecutor argued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter enjoyed a "4 1/2-year joy ride" with J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, the 
founder of J. David, Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo said, adding that the 
ride was fueled by money they had gotten from investors who had been "enticed 
by false track records." 
</P>
<P>
Once enticed, about 1,500 investors were lulled into believing the $80 million 
they had invested in J. David over those 4 1/2 years was earning fabulous 
returns because they were mailed "monthly, fictitious, non-existent trading 
results," Hugo said. 
</P>
<P>
"That joy ride came to a screeching halt in 1984," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That summary of the case, meanwhile, was about all that Hugo got to tell jurors 
Friday as she began her closing argument in Hunter's 197-count federal 
tax-evasion and fraud trial. Hugo ran out of time as she began to go over what 
she called the highlights of eight months of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Hunter stem from her role as a top executive in J. David 
from 1979 until February, 1984, when company checks began to bounce and nervous 
investors forced the firm into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have contended since the trial began in March that Hunter played an 
active role in the J. David affair, a huge Ponzi scheme. Her defense attorneys 
have maintained that she was blinded by her love for Dominelli and was unaware 
of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and income-tax evasion 
and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments in Hunter's case had been scheduled to begin early Friday 
morning, but last-minute witnesses testifying to minor details delayed the 
start of Hugo's argument until late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo began with her summary of the case, then described Hunter, saying she was 
"sophisticated, well-traveled and intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a woman who, when she sets her mind to something, she accomplishes 
it," Hugo said of the former Del Mar mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Hugo began her review of the sets of charges against Hunter. But U.S. 
District Judge Earl B. Gilliam Jr. called court to a close after Hugo had 
gotten through her claim that prosecutors had proven that Hunter, or someone 
acting at Hunter's direction, used the mails to send investors the statements. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the mails must be shown to prove mail fraud as well as fraud by a 
commodities pool operator, two of the sets of charges against Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam ordered that Hugo resume her argument Tuesday. Defense attorneys will 
follow Hugo, then the jury will get the case. 
</P>
<P>
Because of court scheduling, however, only two days of trial are set for next 
week. Jury deliberations are not likely to begin until the week after. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said Friday that he had decided not to sequester the jury, though he 
had "seriously considered" such a move because of press attention to the case.

URBAN CORPS INTRODUCES FIRST GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Urban Corps, a newly formed organization designed to provide jobs 
for unemployed San Diegans from 18 to 23 years old, introduced its first 25 
inductees to the public Friday in a ceremony in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Sam Duran said the goal of the corps is not just to provide 
jobs to young adults but to involve them more extensively "and more 
meaningfully" in the community as a whole. Duran said he hopes the corps will 
serve as a deterrent to drug abuse and lawlessness but added that it "is hardly 
limited to the underprivileged." 
</P>
<P>
"We took in three homeless people," he said, "but is the corps open to a rich 
kid from La Jolla who needs a job? Certainly. We'll take people who have 
anything ranging from an eighth-grade education to a college degree. If, for 
some reason, they're stifled, maybe we can help them. We want these kids to 
learn the experience of the work ethic. We want them to know the experience of 
going to work at a certain hour and doing so clean and sober." 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran with 12 years in the conservation field, Duran said he was hired 
by the board of directors with the aim of placing some in jobs related to 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Duran said that $93,000 had been collected from individuals and charities as 
"start-up" money. He said the corps' headquarters are at 13th and Market 
streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Wes Pratt, a member of the corps' board, said, "Now we're able 
to put unemployed youth to work on conservation projects that benefit all San 
Diegans. This is truly an investment in our natural resource, the youth of San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Duran said none of the members has a job yet, "but we hope to be placing some 
real soon."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office made its recommendation 
Thursday to the county Probation Department on the 12-year-old Mira Mesa boy 
who was playing with Barbara Pacheco when she was fatally shot in October. 
</P>
<P>
The Probation Department should reach a decision in two to three weeks on how 
to prosecute the boy, said Carlos Armour of the district attorney's office. 
Armour said the boy will either be put in a probation program to avoid standing 
trial, or he will be criminally prosecuted by the district attorney's office. 
Armour declined to say what action his office had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"We have ruled out that it was an accident, but that doesn't mean it was 
intentional," Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco, a 13-year-old Challenger Junior High School girl, was found in the 
home of the classmate she was visiting, with a gunshot wound in her face.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside police officer shot a Vista man Friday after the officer was 
dragged by the victim's vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Joseph Ballard, 32, was stopped about 2 a.m. in a car he was driving on 
Mission Avenue near Clementine Street by Officer Carl Regalado, Oceanside 
police spokesman Bob George said. 
</P>
<P>
When the officer discovered that the vehicle was stolen, Ballard tried to flee. 
After a struggle, Regalado, who was dragged several feet by the fleeing 
vehicle, shot Ballard once in the neck, George said. He gave no further details 
on how the officer got into a position to be dragged by the car. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard was taken by helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where 
he was in serious but stable condition Friday afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Regalado, a three-year veteran, suffered minor injuries and was placed on 
administrative leave until an investigation of the shooting is complete, George 
said.

HEED ADVISORIES, SCIENTIST WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boaters and coastal residents should pay special attention to weather 
advisories during November and December, when higher than usual tides will 
occur, a Scripps scientist advises. 
</P>
<P>
The highest tides of the 1989-90 winter season -- some up to 7.7 feet -- will 
occur Nov. 10-16 and Dec. 9-15, according to Dr. Reinhard E. Flick, a Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography oceanographer who also works with the California 
Department of Boating and Waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Although not considered dangerous by themselves, the high tides combined with a 
storm or high winds could create hazardous coastal conditions, Flick said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tides are predictable, but storm conditions cannot be predicted with accuracy 
until at most a few days before the event," he said. "Beachfront residents and 
communities should be especially aware of local weather reports during these 
periods." 
</P>
<P>
Flick said morning tides in San Diego will peak at 7.7 feet Nov. 13 and Dec. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
During recent winters, when higher than average sea levels coincided with 
coastal storms, some Southern California cities have suffered severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a warning that 
the higher than usual tides may add to the threat of coastal flooding and 
navigation hazards along the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts.

PRINTS SHOW ANIMAL SEEN BY GOLFER PROBABLY A BOBCAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The animal a golfer spotted earlier this week in Mission Valley was probably 
not a mountain lion but a smaller, "much less ferocious" bobcat, a spokeswoman 
for the State Department of Fish and Game said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Ginny Boas said that, after a thorough investigation near a fairway 
of the Stardust Country Club golf course, fish and game agents had "determined 
that the animal in question is a bobcat. Or rather, let's say, because of the 
footprints and the markings, we suspect that the animal was a bobcat." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robinson, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Police Department, said the 
golfer called police after he thought he had seen "a small mountain lion" 
during a morning round of golf on the course near Hotel Circle South. 
</P>
<P>
"We dispatched officers and a helicopter but had no luck in finding the 
animal," Robinson said. "The golfer indicated the cat had gone into a large 
drainage pipe that runs adjacent to the course. Fish and game then took over 
the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Both the State Department of Fish and Game and the San Diego County Department 
of Animal Control determined that a mountain lion was loose in a Tierrasanta 
neighborhood in early October. Residents on Mission Village Drive near San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium have claimed to have seen one, and investigators 
agreed that the tracks -- 3 1/2 inches in diameter -- as well as the signs left 
behind, indicated they were right. The animal is believed to have killed a 
house cat belonging to a couple on the street. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Sept. 27, civil engineer Peter J. Pountney told police he had 
seen two mountain lions near his office on Murphy Canyon Road near Balboa 
Avenue. Each of the recent sightings -- whether of bobcats or mountain lions -- 
has occurred in roughly the same area, near or in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ken Maehler of the fish and game department said mountain lions and bobcats 
are common in and around Julian and Descanso -- the more mountainous areas of 
the county -- and come down to the city after unusually dry weather, which San 
Diego has had most of this year.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD BEATS AUSTRALIANS IN OPENER

The University of San Diego men's basketball team began its season with a 91-81 
exhibition victory over Australia's Eastside Melbourne Spectres Friday at the 
USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Senior John Jerome, who red-shirted last season, led USD with 21 points. Senior 
Craig Cottrell added 10 points. Shawn Hamilton, a community college transfer 
from Mesa, Ariz., had seven rebounds, and freshman Pat Holbert had eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
USD took an 8-2 lead and never trailed. It took its biggest lead of the half, 
42-26, with a 10-0 run with four minutes remaining. The Toreros, who 
substituted freely, had a 27-point lead five minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 7:35, Jerome (6-feet-8) scored 14 of the Toreros' first 23 points, 
including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
USD shot well from the floor -- 58% (38 of 66) -- but converted on just 10 of 
17 free throws, three of seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Eastside Melbourne was led by Steve deLaveaga's 22 points. DeLaveaga normally 
plays for San Diego's High Five America, but Melbourne was permitted to use two 
American players. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International opens its season tonight (7:30) at Serra High against the 
same Eastside Melbourne team. JIM LINDGREN

<P>
Santana High School knew it was in trouble when Grossmont's Erik Weichelt 
returned the opening kickoff 69 yards to set up a two-yard touchdown run by 
Keith Price 2 1/2 minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sultans may have readied themselves for a Grossmont offense that had 
outscored its previous three opponents, 153-10. But Santana was not prepared 
for what happened on its first offensive play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Penwarden, the second-leading rusher in the county, was gang tackled after 
a two-yard gain. Penwarden went back to the huddle, but when the second play 
started, he just stood in the backfield, holding the right side of his back. 
</P>
<P>
Two yards was all Penwarden would end up with for the night, as he was 
eventually taken to the hospital with a possible kidney injury or fractured 
vertebrae. And the Sultans did not fare much better as No. 6 Grossmont (8-0-1) 
scored on its first six possessions for a 41-0 victory that virtually decided 
the Grossmont 2-A League championship. 
</P>
<P>
With Penwarden out, Santana (5-2-1) not only lost its leading rusher but also 
its leader. Santana never seemed to recover emotionally, and a dominating 
Grossmont defense became even more so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think more than anything it was an emotional let down for Santana," 
Grossmont Coach Judd Hulbert said. "But it's awful hard to run against our 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont proved that point by holding Santana, which was averaging 387 yards 
rushing per game, to 87. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to shut down every team we play," said defensive lineman Dave Park. 
"We wanted to prove we could do it to any team, anywhere, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Price finished with 168 yards and four touchdowns on 23 carries to lead 
the Grossmont offense. The Foothillers scored on their first six drives and 
looked as if they would score on its seventh when Price fumbled at the Sultan 
five. RICK HAZELTINE In another Grossmont 2-A game: Valhalla 7, El Cajon Valley 
0 -- Chris Wyse gained 116 yards on 16 carries, scored the only touchdown on a 
25-yard run and had two interceptions to lead host Valhalla (4-4-1, 2-2) 
against El Cajon Valley (1-8, 0-3). Grossmont 3-A League Monte Vista 34, El 
Capitan 0 -- It was Ernie Reyes' night at Monte Vista: He carried seven times 
for 102 yards and one touchdown, caught a 25-yard pass from Deron Claiborne for 
another touchdown, kicked field goals of 30 and 45 yards and kicked three extra 
points. Charles Whitehead added 96 yards on 13 carries for Monte Vista (5-4, 
2-2). El Capitan is 0-8-1, 0-3. Helix 37, Granite Hills 7 -- Helix quarterback 
Rob Ippolito completed 12 of 24 passes for 216 yards and a touchdown, and 
teammate Jarrett Parr carried 19 times for 220 yards and two touchdowns, 
including runs of 74 and 54 yards. Chris Masilon caught three of Ippolito's 
passes for 71 yards. City Eastern League Point Loma 35, Madison 21 -- The 
county's leading passer, Danny White, completed 17 of 28 for 302 yards and

quarterback Teddy Lawrence ran five times for 54 yards and completed seven of 
eight passes for 93 yards and one touchdown. Henry's Luke Lowrey was 19 of 31 
for a season-high 318 yards. Mira Mesa 38, Serra 14 -- J.J. Rowlette competed 
six of nine passes for 120 yards, and Wayne Pittman ran for 91 yards and a 
touchdown on 16 carries for Mira Mesa (6-3, 2-2). Serra's Tom Cotner completed 
11 of 20 for 248 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions. City Western 
League University 29, La Jolla 7 -- Anthony Hill completed seven of 13 passes 
for 118 yards and one touchdown. His primary receiver was Jerome Price, who had 
five catches for 95 yards. City Central League Crawford 27, San Diego 0 -- 
Peter Ervin gained 117 yards and scored two touchdowns on seven carries for 
visiting Crawford (7-2, 3-1). Quarterback Phil Parker added 68 yards and a 
touchdown on seven attempts. Crawford held San Diego (3-6, 0-4) to 49 yards in 
total offense. USDHS 54, Clairemont 7 -- Doug Abts ran for 155 yards and three 
touchdowns on 13 carries, and Bryan Duplessis had 149 yards and a touchdown on 
12 carries for USDHS (5-3, 2-2), which rolled up 550 total yards to 
Clairemont's 40. Avocado League San Pasqual 23, Oceanside 7 -- Cullen Owen had 
87 yards on 20 carries and Andy Bacon had 56 yards on 13 carries, including a 
28-yard touchdown run, for No. 9 San Pasqual (8-1, 4-1). Terry Vaughn, the 
county's leading rusher, had 133 yards on 36 carries for Oceanside (4-4, 3-2). 
Metro Conference Sweetwater 16, Southwest 7 -- Sophomore Javier Garcia kicked 
second-half field goals of 42, 40 and 43 yards at Southwest to lift Sweetwater 
(4-5, 4-2) to its fourth victory in five games. Southwest, searching for its 
first Metro title, fell to 5-3-1, 4-1-1. Andy Quinn's eight-yard touchdown pass 
to David Sewell gave Southwest a 7-0 second-quarter lead. Sweetwater's Tana 
Lepule scored on a one-yard dive with 26 seconds left in the half. Mar Vista 6, 
Castle Park 0 -- Richard Vega scored on a 67-yard punt return in the third 
quarter for Mar Vista (3-6, 1-5). Vega had 25 carries for 147 yards. Castle 
Park dropped to 4-5, 1-5. Chula Vista 28, Bonita Vista 6 -- Trennell Hicks

KEARNY'S SCOTT UPENDS MISSION BAY

Mission Bay's Big D -- its county-leading defense and proudest accomplishment 
this season -- ran head on into a Big D of another kind Friday night at Mesa 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny's Darnay Scott, a transfer student from St. Louis, had four catches for 
55 yards and two touchdowns, one on a 92-yard kickoff return, to help silence 
Mission Bay, 30-10, in a pivotal City Western League football game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no substitute for speed," said Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh. "And he 
(Scott) obviously has it." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's explosive kickoff return had a stunning effect on the Buccaneers who, 
with less than a minute to play in the second quarter, trailed the Komets by 
just 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
"That touchdown before the half really hurt us," said Pugh, who had enough 
problems with his top utility player -- running back/receiver/defensive back 
Pat Betancourt -- out of the game with a bad ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"They relied a lot on (quarterback Andy) Guyader's arm," said Kearny Coach 
Willie Matson, whose Komets improved to 8-1, 4-0 and have only University City 
to play next week. "Dennis told me before the game that Betancourt was out. I 
thought he was kidding. With someone like him out, that hurt them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Guyader, a sophomore, was four for 18 for 74 yards and threw three 
interceptions, two of which Kearny was able to capitalize on. Derrick Hardwick 
intercepted a Guyader pass in the third quarter, and the Komets took over on 
their own 28 with just over six minutes remaining. Eight plays later, Larry 
Thurman kicked an 18-yard field goal to make it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Munchie Brown picked off a pass intended for Caprece 
Pressley to set up Kearny's final touchdown. Quarterback Tommy Rawlins (10 of 
15, 107 yards, three touchdowns) found Scott wide open and lobbed him a 10-yard 
pass to make it 30-10. The extra point failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just found a lot of holes," Scott said, "I'm very happy, but this wasn't my 
best game." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay's only touchdown came early in the final period, when Schearon 
Stewart ran 16 yards up the middle. Brent Kirsten's kick made it 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins hopes the victory, coupled with a victory next week against University 
City, will give the unranked Komets some credibility when playoff seeding time 
comes. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't too many teams in the county that are 8-1 with a one-point loss 
(to Serra)," Rawlins said.

GTE, Home Shopping Settle Suit: GTE Corp. accepted an undisclosed sum in cash 
to settle its 2-year-long legal battle with Home Shopping Network Inc. The GTE 
Florida and GTE Communications units won the libel and slander award in August, 
after a circuit court jury in Florida rejected a $1.5-billion lawsuit in which 
Home Shopping accused GTE of supplying inadequate telephone equipment and 
service. The two companies agreed to end all litigation and claims against each 
other. While the amount of the settlement was not disclosed, company officials 
did say it was negligible in comparison to the $100-million jury award.

Crazy Shirts Lawuit Settled: A San Francisco Superior Court judge approved 
settlement of a statewide lawsuit against Crazy Shirts, a Tustin-based chain of 
T-shirt stores accused of illegally requiring store management applicants to 
take lie detector tests. Jocelyn D. Larkin, who represented the plaintiffs in 
the class-action suit filed last year, said that under the settlement, Crazy 
Shirts employees and job applicants who were required to take polygraph tests 
will be awarded damages ranging from $800 to $7,000 each. An estimated 30 to 40 
persons are affected, she said.

GAP TO SHUT ITS HEMISPHERE RETAIL CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gap Inc. will shut down its nine-store Hemisphere chain by the end of January, 
bringing to a close a money-losing experiment in upscale attire, company 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We said this is an experiment and we would only expand it if it met the 
returns we require of any of our businesses," said Warren R. Hashagen, vice 
president and treasurer of the San Bruno, Calif.-based clothing chain. "It was 
not profitable." 
</P>
<P>
Hashagen refused to disclose how much money the Hemisphere chain had lost in 
its short life. But closing the Hemisphere stores, he said, will allow Gap to 
route its resources back to its core businesses: Gap Stores, GapKids, Gap 
International and Banana Republic. Hemisphere's first three stores opened in 
August, 1987. The chain had outlets in pricey malls such as the South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa and the Watertower in Chicago and offered casual wear for 
well-heeled women and men. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, both Banana Republic and Hemisphere were starting to target the 
same market, admittedly with a different product line," said Thomas Tashjian, 
retail trade analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. "Eventually 
they would have been borrowing from each other. . . . Hemisphere was an 
upscale, name-brand Gap." 
</P>
<P>
Tashjian said Friday that Gap was wise to shut down the tiny Hemisphere chain 
before it lost any more money in a market that the company wasn't even sure it 
wanted to be in. Closing down early in the year will allow the company to 
liquidate Hemisphere's merchandise during the busy holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
News about Gap isn't all bad, however. Even though the troubled Banana Republic 
chain is not out of the woods yet, Hashagen said his company has signed leases 
to open 15 new Banana Republic outlets within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tashjian, sales in Banana Republic stores open more than one year 
were up in September and "respectable against a very strong performance a year 
ago when the company was aggressively promoting." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gap has tightened overhead and upper management costs in the Banana 
Republic division, he said, and it should be profitable in 1990, for the first 
time in three years.

SECURITY PACIFIC TO INCREASE ARIZONA LOAN-LOSS RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp., stung by Arizona's continuing real estate woes, said 
Friday that it will substantially increase loan-loss reserves for its bank 
there and put the unit's problem loans into a separate holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The loan-loss reserves -- money set aside to cover future losses -- will be 
boosted by an unspecified amount in the fourth quarter, but earnings in the 
period are still expected to be higher than a year earlier, Security Pacific 
said. That is because the move will be offset by gains from sales of assets, 
including an office in Singapore, said John F. Kooken, Security Pacific's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Los Angeles-based banking company said its Security Pacific 
Bancorp Northwest subsidiary has reached agreement to buy Mountain West Savings 
Bank in Idaho for $31.5 million. The bank would be Security Pacific's first in 
that state, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific, parent of Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, is 
one of a number of banks hurt by Arizona's soft real estate market. Last month, 
for example, First Interstate Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based parent of First 
Interstate Bank, reported a loss of $15.5 million stemming from problem loans 
at its Arizona bank. 
</P>
<P>
Kooken said in an interview that Security Pacific's Arizona bank has lost $50 
million after taxes through the first nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Kooken said Security Pacific has $465 million in non-performing loans in 
Arizona, about 40% of its portfolio there. Putting those assets into a separate 
company will allow Security Pacific to deal more easily with its problems in 
the state, he said.

THE RED ARMY CHORUS -- A SHOW OF STRENGTH INSIDE, OUTSIDE SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be an evening of cultural exchange -- the famed Red Army 
Chorus making its much-ballyhooed Los Angeles debut on this first American 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
But who could have known that exchange would take place on the street outside 
Shrine Auditorium? Or last there for three hours? Or include the rousing, 
spirited songs of an Armenian homeland under siege, as performed by more than 
1,000 protesting emigres from that Soviet Republic? 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators -- carrying signs that declared there was famine, disease and 
massacres of their people at the hands of the Azerbaijanis -- thronged the area 
and blocked the entrances with bodies 20 deep on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care if the Red Army sings and dances," said one demonstrator, "but 
we must bring attention to the fact that their comrades-in-arms have not acted 
to protect the citizenry in Karabakh" (a disputed territory on the border 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan). 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the scheduled 8 p.m. curtain, the doors to the Shrine remained 
closed. The protesters, generally peaceful and bursting into song from time to 
time, still lined the blocklong sidewalk in front, while the remaining audience 
members crammed the narrow pavement across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those with tickets, angered by the blockade, began singing "America" 
and yelling taunts. But by 10:20 p.m., ticket-holders filed past a parking lot 
to the rear entrance of a hall adjoining the Shrine. Inside, with the remains 
of a banquet still on tables, they were kept waiting there for half an hour and 
finally led into the auditorium as soon as the crowd outside was dispersed by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes later the curtain rose to vigorous applause by about 300 
determined spectators. And the Red Army Chorus and orchestra, with 
hammer-and-sickle and stars-and-stripes as a backdrop, applauded in return. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing khaki uniforms in the style of airline pilots, the 80 singers and the 
orchestra launched into the American anthem followed by their own. And 
throughout the next hour and a half they did not disappoint those who thrilled 
to their recordings from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
True, the program was a hokey potpourri of songs and ethnic dancing in the best 
show-biz style. It included such international concert pops numbers as 
"Granada" and "I Got Plenty of Nothin," as sung by a positively stentorian 
Barseg Tumanyan, as well as the de rigueur "Dark Eyes" ("Otchitchornye") and 
"Kalinka." 
</P>
<P>
But the sound of those massed male voices -- a deep, cataclysmic roar that 
comes, seemingly, from across the steppes and falls to a hush -- could not be 
mistaken for any other. 
</P>
<P>
All the more reason to decry the odd amplification. But basso Eduard Labkovski, 
for one, rose above it for a doleful peace-making number called "Do the 
Russians Want War?" And Leonid Pshenichny in a rafter-ringing "Amapola," sang 
with an extrovert's sense of romantic Spanish grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
The balalaikas in this excellent orchestra strummed, the whiz-bang solo 
whistlers embellished stanzas here and there, the perfectly drilled dancers 
performed their maneuvers (as well as a jitterbug and square dance) with 
virtuosic gusto and in a final gesture to its American hosts the company sang 
"God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Surely some would have added Armenia to the title.

THE HOUSE IS DIVIDED OVER TV SERIES ABOUT A NEWCOMER IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one has asked for a roll-call vote or suggested a filibuster, but the new 
CBS series "Top of the Hill," about the adventures of a freshman lawmaker, is 
sparking lighthearted debate in the halls of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a marvelous idea," said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), an 
attorney who is a first-term lawmaker from Newport Beach. "If television can 
make a show about cops and robbers and cowboys and Indians, they can certainly 
make a show about the war zone here on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
The show, from Stephen J. Cannell Productions, features a handsome young 
California surfer named Thomas Bell Jr., played by William Katt, who arrives in 
Congress to fill the seat of his ailing father. Needless to say, Cox -- who 
maintains that his congressional district has some of the best surfing -- was 
curious about a television show focused on a freshman lawmaker representing a 
similar area. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe that real life in the Capitol is more exciting and dramatic 
than the show gives it credit for," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints were voiced by two members of the House of Representatives 
who have appeared in television series. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Fred Grandy (D-Iowa), who played Gopher on "The Love Boat" and is now in 
his second term in Congress and a member of the House Agriculture Committee, 
watched the first episode Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the obvious inaccuracies and cliches, it was boring," Grandy said. "I 
was debating whether to watch the whole show or finish a report on crop 
insurance. Crop insurance won." 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look like Congress and it didn't feel like Congress," said Rep. Ben 
Jones (D-Ga.), who appeared in "The Dukes of Hazzard" and is serving his first 
term in Congress. "It struck me that what they were doing was pretty silly. 
</P>
<P>
"The real experience has been much more interesting and substantive and more 
compelling that what they were doing on the show," Jones said. "I don't 
understand why they didn't try to present a more thoughtful and realistic 
portrayal of life in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting a congressional audience on Thursday night, when the show airs, is 
difficult because that is the night when many of the lawmakers leave Washington 
for their district offices. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Jill Long (D-Ind.), 
say their schedules leave little time for television. "As a freshman member of 
Congress, I don't have time to watch situation comedies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Glen Browder (D-Ala.), a former secretary of state in Alabama, came across 
"Top of the Hill" by accident when he happened to be watching television. He 
said he found it "entertaining from a personal standpoint -- being a new 
congressman (watching) a show about a new congressman." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's like everything else on TV," he said. "If they made it realistic, 
not even I would watch. No one wants to watch someone for 30 minutes to an hour 
signing papers or going over reports. It is a typical entertainment treatment 
of a government institution. 
</P>
<P>
"It may even improve the image of Congress," Browder said. "I've got a 
14-year-old daughter who comes down to the office a good bit and I don't think 
sees me running off to rescue any hostages. Maybe it will raise my status in 
her eyes." 
</P>
<P>
While Cox found the Katt character believable, he agreed that the show has 
skimped on realism. 
</P>
<P>
"For Washington insiders, the show lacks verisimilitude," he said. "As amply 
pointed out by reviewers, there were glitches from a roll-call vote to an L.A. 
Federal Building in place of the Capitol." (In the House of Representatives, 
members vote electronically and not as depicted by a voice roll call.) But Cox 
disagreed with the critics who charged that the gallivanting adventures of a 
freshman lawmaker, including a rescue attempt of a constituent in a foreign 
country, are far from the reality of day-to-day life in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think that was so far off the mark," Cox said of the rescue 
episode. "I think members of Congress do things like that, but they may not get 
into such physical difficulties." He recalled a trip to observe elections in El 
Salvador where he and other members found themselves donning bulletproof vests 
for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect the show was modeled after our boss," said David Eisner, press 
spokesman for freshman lawmaker Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), with a laugh. 
"He surfs all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, an avid bodysurfer and a writer with a screenplay currently under 
consideration, said: "I think it's good to have a show about Congress as long 
as it tries to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried that because you basically have people from the (political) left 
writing the scripts, you may end up with a show where the only heroic people 
are liberals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher also said that "coming up with good ideas that are interesting and 
entertaining about politicians is very difficult. Most people want to turn the 
TV off when a politician's face comes on." 
</P>
<P>
Then, lightheartedly, he added, "It might have been better to make this a 
cartoon instead of a dramatic series. Having worked in Congress now, it looks 
like the Mad Hatter's tea party." If not a cartoon, he said with a laugh, then 
maybe an episode of "The Twilight Zone."

MOVIES: BLUE-COLLAR FILM MAKER'S "ROGER &amp; ME," A SAGA OF GM LAYOFFS, HAS 
CAPTURED HOLLYWOOD'S INTEREST. 
</P>

<P>
Consider the case of Michael Moore, a rumpled 235-pound Flint, Mich., native 
whose first directorial effort, "Roger &amp; Me," has catapulted him into the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Three years in the making, this darkly humorous documentary about General 
Motors layoffs in his hometown has emerged as the unlikely toast of the film 
festivals -- setting attendance records at Telluride, voted "most popular" in 
Toronto, eliciting a seven-minute standing ovation at the New York Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Five major studios have courted him. Agents are banging down his door. After 
announcing a $2.5-million to $3-million distribution deal with Warner Bros. on 
Monday, he flew out to work out the details. And, not so incidentally, to 
ensure that he "goes Hollywood" on his terms. 
</P>
<P>
Reality soon intervenes. It took years of personal fund-raising for Moore to 
come up with the $260,000 that the film cost to make. He got $50,000 from 
Tuesday-night Bingo games, $27,000 from the sale of his home, $5,000 from a 
couple of yard sales, plus every dime he had, and he still had to borrow 
$100,000. He arrived at the Registry Hotel in Universal City this week with 
about $60 in his wallet. He was $60 short of the $150 the hotel required for 
people without credit cards and he had to call the studio for help. 
</P>
<P>
"The Warner driver passed me a (business) card and asked if he could cater my 
next film," the 35-year-old director recalls. "I didn't tell him that my idea 
of catering is driving through McDonald's as fast as I can, picking up a sack 
of MacNuggets." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's sardonic wit (which has led to comparisons with Garrison Keillor and 
Andy Rooney) is central to the success of "Roger &amp; Me," which is scheduled 
to open Dec. 22 in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. Over footage of an ailing 
Flint, the writer-producer-director describes deadpan-style his futile quest to 
bring General Motors CEO Roger Smith to Flint for one day to observe the human 
toll of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Following a "trail of three-martini lunches," we watch the defiantly 
working-class Moore lumber into the venerable halls of the Grosse Pointe Yacht 
Club, the Waldorf-Astoria, and GM corporate headquarters in Detroit. He turns 
up large doses of Theater of the Absurd on the way: Ronald Reagan treating a 
dozen unemployed workers to pizza, suggesting they move to Texas to find work; 
a $100 million-plus Auto World designed to promote tourism to the beleaguered 
town; society couples paying $100 apiece for a night in the newly constructed 
jail -- with free fingerprinting and Breathalyzer test thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy with an interesting way of looking at things, which I find very 
refreshing," says Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, the 
first major studio to fly the film maker out. "For someone right out of the 
box, he shows tremendous promise." 
</P>
<P>
"My film is much closer to 'Pee-wee's Great Adventure' than to 'Hotel 
Terminus,' " says Moore. "It was made, after all, by someone who can't stand to 
watch 'Nova,' a guy who'd rather see 'Lethal Weapon' than 'Wings of Desire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as "populist" rather than "left wing," Moore is a man on a 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Flint is a microcosm of what's going on in the country," he says. "Coming to 
your town soon . . . and I don't mean the movie. 'Roger &amp; Me' is a small 
attempt to get America to pay attention to the face behind the corporations, to 
pull back the curtain -- just as they did in 'The Wizard of Oz.' " 
</P>
<P>
General Motors claims Moore is giving the auto maker a bum rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Moore showed up unannounced with his cameras rolling '60 Minutes'-style," 
says Jim Crellin, director of corporate media relations for the company. "If 
he'd called or written asking for a formal interview, it would have ruined his 
film. From what I've read, 'Roger &amp; Me' is less a documentary than a social 
commentary, one individual's perspective. Mr. Moore certainly didn't stick to 
the facts. If you go to Flint, you won't find a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
Moore has strong personal ties to Flint and to the company. His father toiled 
on GM'S A.C. Spark Plug assembly line for 33 years. Uncle Laverne was one of 
the original "sitdowners" whose 1937 strike led to the recognition of the 
United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Young Michael was political, too, memorizing Kennedy's inaugural address by the 
age of 6 and waging a successful campaign for the school board during his 
senior year of high school. In 1976, he founded the Flint Voice, which became 
the Michigan Voice, an alternative newspaper that often monitored the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for "Roger &amp; Me" surfaced in 1986, shortly after Moore was fired 
as editor of Mother Jones, a progressive San Francisco-based monthly. Moore 
clashed with the publisher over both cultural and political subjects and four 
months after arriving there, he says, "they offered me a U-Haul home." (Moore 
says sarcastically that he should have thanked Mother Jones in the film's 
credits; he poured the $58,000 he got from his settlement with the magazine 
into his movie.) 
</P>
<P>
In Flint, GM's announcement of plant shutdowns put Moore's depression in 
perspective. That night he came up with the narrative thread for his film and, 
shortly thereafter, he called on the director of "The Atomic Cafe" -- a film 
that took a sardonic view of the nuclear age -- to give him a one-week crash 
course in film making. 
</P>
<P>
It was Warner's "passion" for the film, says Moore, that made the difference. 
While others wanted to lure him into three-picture deals, Warner executives 
viewed the film as the star. "They promised to show it in Hayes, Kan.," Moore 
says. "Just the attitude I was looking for. I want the film to reach not only 
the art-house crowd but the working-class people who don't normally go to 
movies . . . the people for whom this one was made." 
</P>
<P>
Moore says he also likes Warner's clout as a buffer against potential GM 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"The power structure is real uptight about this film and a smaller outfit might 
not be able to take the heat," he says. "If this film becomes a hot potato, I 
need my titan to go against their titan. The bigger the better to protect me 
and this film." 
</P>
<P>
Though General Motors denies any suggestion that it might interfere with the 
release of the film, one member of the Warner contingent isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"If General Motors bitched, that would be the best thing that could happen to 
us," says Joe Hyams, senior vice president of special projects for the studio. 
"If you look at the movie, though, they're dumb enough to do just that. Smith's 
advisers, I'm sure, told him to ignore this . . . but they're probably the same 
people who told him not to worry about the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Moore says things are going well in his relationship with Warner. The 
studio agreed to donate $25,000 to rent or buy housing for the four families 
shown being evicted in the film and to oversee the distribution of 20,000 free 
tickets (to be paid for out of Moore's advance) to unemployed auto workers 
nationwide. The studio also guaranteed a minimum of $3 million in advertising 
and prints to assure the director the movie won't be buried. 
</P>
<P>
Moore will match the Warner contribution and channel 30% to 40% of his share of 
the profits into a nonprofit foundation supporting other socially oriented 
films.

A SIMPLE TRIBUTE TO SCREEN LEGEND BETTE DAVIS ON STAGE 18; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: FRIENDS GATHER AT BURBANK STUDIOS TO HONOR STORMY ACTRESS WHO "REVELED" 
IN HER STARDOM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bette Davis was in a class by herself, and so was the invitation-only memorial 
tribute to her Thursday evening at the Burbank Studios on Stage 18. It was the 
sound stage where she filmed six of the pictures she made for Warner Bros. 
during a long tenure marked by legendary battles with Jack Warner over the 
worthiness of material he chose for her. 
</P>
<P>
It was, as David Hartman announced, a "no frills" occasion and in perfect 
keeping with Davis's no-nonsense, let's-get-on-with-it Yankee spirit. Stage 18 
was barren except for neat rows of folding chairs for the guests, some old 
props, a camera and a couple of spotlights, and was all the more moving a 
setting for being so unmistakably a workplace. No photographers were permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Above a platform where Hartman, James Woods and Angela Lansbury spoke of their 
friend and colleague, hung a screen for projecting film clips prepared for last 
April's Lincoln Center tribute to Davis. To either side of the screen were 
suspended three blowups of stills from some of her Warner films: on the left, 
"Hollywood Canteen" and two from "All This, and Heaven Too"; on the right, 
"Now, Voyager," "Jezebel" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" 
</P>
<P>
Several superstars previously announced as attending were nowhere to be seen, 
but that was all right too. Most of the people there actually knew and worked 
with Davis and cared enough about her to come and pay their final respects. 
Among those from Warner's -- and Davis' golden era -- were writer Julius 
Epstein, director Vincent Sherman, editor Rudi Fehr, actresses Janis Paige and 
Joan Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, those involved in the one-hour-plus tribute staged by director George 
Schaefer were concerned with trying to live up to the high standards Davis set 
for herself. There was none of the easy, impersonal sentimentality or the 
self-congratulation that marks so many Hollywood tributes to its own. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman observed that Davis unabashedly loved being a star: "She reveled in it, 
she trumpeted it and she celebrated it." She admitted that to accomplish her 
goals she had "to have the guts to be hated," he added. He noted that a wise 
man once said that the most a person can hope to say of himself or herself is 
that "I was here, and I mattered." There could be no doubt that Bette Davis was 
here and that she mattered. Lansbury spoke briefly and informally of Davis' 
"bravura acting of the first order." 
</P>
<P>
Woods recalled the transforming impact of seeing "Now, Voyager" for the first 
time and of experiencing the "naked emotion" that Davis brought to her acting. 
He spoke of her compulsion to go beyond the horizon, of her ability to touch 
"the fat lady in the fourth row" -- a borrowing from J. D. Salinger's "Franny 
and Zooey" -- and make her -- and us -- say to ourselves, "I thought only I 
felt that." He surmised that her "great power was that she knew who she was." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Woods invited those who knew Davis to look beyond the 
often-imitated trademark mannerisms -- the clipped speech, the punctuations 
with cigarettes, the nervous gestures, the popping eyes -- and to respond to 
the sheer honesty and unapologetic intelligence of Davis' portrayal of such 
diverse characters as the middle-aging Broadway star Margo Channing, the hearty 
but merciless Queen Elizabeth I and "Dark Victory's" ill-fated, gallant Judith 
Traherne. Never before have Davis' heroines seemed so timeless. 
</P>
<P>
The tribute climaxed with that enormously touching silent montage of Bette 
Davis' face from countless films prepared for her 1977 American Film Institute 
Life Achievement Award. It was followed by a recent color still of Davis, 
accompanied by her off-key half-singing, half-talking of "I Wish You Love," the 
one mawkish note she herself might have edited out. As the recording ended, 
Robert Wagner got up and turned on a work light, signaling the conclusion of a 
worthy celebration of an unforgettable woman.

FLOOD OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS TIED TO MEASURE M EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A record number of absentee ballots for an off-year election -- about 20,000 -- 
is flooding Orange County Registrar of Voters Don Tanney's office, apparently 
in response to heavy targeting of residents by those who support Measure M, the 
proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, as the absentee ballots piled up in Tanney's office, county employees 
scrambled to verify that the signatures on them were valid. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it in an off-year election," Tanney said. "I 
expect a few thousand more will come in over the weekend, and, of course, we'll 
get another few thousand on Election Day at the polling places." 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for an off-year election was 10,856 absentee ballots cast 
in November, 1987. Tanney cautioned, however, that no comparisons with 
Tuesday's election can be accurate because this is a special, countywide tax 
election that is occurring at the same time as some previously scheduled voting 
in several cities -- elections in school, water and community service 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney said that absentee ballots traditionally are excellent predictors of the 
final election outcome. One notable exception occurred in 1986, however, when 
Newport Beach residents defeated the proposed expansion of Newport Center even 
though absentee balloting went the other way by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Yes on M, which has raised and spent more than $2 million so 
far, mostly money from developers, mailed more than 50,000 absentee ballot 
applications to people identified in surveys as likely supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I obviously don't know how good their targeting is, but I'd guess their effort 
has been pretty successful," said Jerry Yudelson, a key opponent of Measure M, 
adding: "But the result really depends on who gets out and votes on Election 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is happening in a vacuum," said Measure M campaign chairman 
Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor who serves on the California 
Transportation Commission. "It must be paying off." 
</P>
<P>
Nestande said that, since last week, 8,000 people returned cards to his 
committee saying that their names could be used for endorsement purposes or for 
other campaign-related work. In addition, a bank of telephone callers and a 
team of precinct walkers has been identifying about 4,000 voters each day as 
definitely favoring Measure M, an effort that serves as the foundation for a 
get-out-the-vote drive on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
VOTER MAIL IT IN 
</P>
<P>
The use of absentee ballots in Orange County's off-year elections has increased 
in the past decade as campaign managers fine tune their ability to target 
specific voters and send them absentee ballot request forms.

GOVERNOR STANDS FAST ON 1/4-CENT; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKE RELIEF: AN ATTEMPT TO BROADEN THE SPECIAL SESSION IS SQUASHED. THE STAGE 
IS SET FOR QUICK LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders Friday squashed attempts to 
broaden a special session of the Legislature beyond plans to raise the sales 
tax by a quarter-cent for 13 months and pass a dozen bills directly related to 
the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and legislators met privately at midday and then put an end to 
efforts by some lawmakers to raise the sales tax by at least half a cent and 
pass nearly 100 quake-related measures not considered crucial at this time. The 
action prompted one senator to angrily resign his chairmanship of an 
influential committee. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he is prepared to raise more taxes later if needed. But he said 
such talk now is "premature." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is what is needed at this time," the governor told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials confirmed Friday, however, that Deukmejian plans to 
take as much as $197 million from other state programs to help fund the 
earthquake relief effort. Some of the money now targeted for quake victims had 
been destined for other housing programs unrelated to the temblor. One 
Democratic lawmaker, Assemblywoman Jackie Speier of South San Francisco, 
denounced the Administration's move as a "shell game." 
</P>
<P>
But the signal having been given by Deukmejian and legislative leaders, 
committees in each house quickly approved separate versions of the sales tax 
measure, setting the stage for the Senate and Assembly to complete the special 
session as soon as today. But the action did not come without rancor. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, there were fireworks when Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) told members of the Revenue and Taxation Committee not 
to bother pushing a half-cent sales tax increase because Deukmejian would not 
accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) dramatically resigned his coveted 
chairmanship of the Revenue and Taxation Committee when it became clear that 
the panel would not pass a tax increase greater than a quarter-cent on the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that precludes us from doing what is right is our own lack of 
courage," Garamendi said as he relinquished the gavel. 
</P>
<P>
The committee then voted 7 to 1, with Garamendi the only dissenter, to pass the 
quarter-cent increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile, passed its own version of the 
tax measure on a strictly partisan 12-5 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came shortly after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
entered the Ways and Means hearing room and told the committee chairman, 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), that he wanted the tax bill 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
"Send it out. I want it out," Brown asserted loudly enough to be heard beyond 
the railing that separates the committee members from the public gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) led the GOP opposition. "I don't understand 
the rush," Nolan said. He called the earthquake relief legislation "a cynical 
manipulation to raise taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan argued that the state, with at least $674 million in reserve, had enough 
to finance short-term earthquake aid through January, when lawmakers return for 
their regular session. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic author of the tax bill, Assemblyman Rusty Areias of Los 
Banos, pointed out that the proposal came from Deukmejian, the ranking 
Republican in the state and a longtime opponent of tax increase measures. 
</P>
<P>
"George Deukmejian has never been known as a big spender," Areias said. "This 
proposal was crafted between the Administration and the leadership of the 
Legislature. We need to get about the process of rebuilding. This is a first 
step." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County legislators offered mixed views on the need for the quarter-cent 
sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) called the rush to pass the measure 
"political posturing." 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what the cost figure (for repairs) is, we don't yet know what 
funds are going to be forthcoming from the federal government," he said. "I 
believe this is not the kind of problem that requires urgent attention in 24 
hours or 48 hours. There is plenty of time to address the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson endorsed a proposal by Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) 
that the state freeze spending for the first 12 weeks of the next fiscal year, 
which begins in July. The move would produce a savings of nearly $800 million, 
the same amount that would be collected by the proposed sales tax, Ferguson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) suggested that the Legislature hold off on the 
sales tax vote until January or February, when more accurate quake damage 
estimates are made. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid we are being placed in a position of voting for something with 
incomplete data and information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Senator William Campbell (R-Haciena Heights), said he supports the 
proposed tax increase "because I believe it is necessary to provide funds 
immediately. . . . We may come back in January and say we need more or less, 
but it is a reasonable amount to ask for at this point." 
</P>
<P>
In testimony to the committee, state Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said the 
state needs to spend just over $1 billion to match federal grants and provide 
financial assistance to local governments. He said the governor's plan is to 
use roughly $800 million from the sales tax increase. Huff said another $245 
million would come from the budget reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But the sales tax revenue and emergency reserve will not be the only source of 
money for earthquake repairs and relief. As part of its program, the Deukmejian 
Administration plans to use as much as $177.5 million from two bond measures 
approved by voters last year to help the homeless and to quake-proof buildings. 
</P>
<P>
One measure is Proposition 77, a $150-million seismic safety bond issue that 
provides $80 million to upgrade masonry buildings considered unsafe in 
earthquakes and another $70 million for rehabilitating low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The second measure is Proposition 84, a $300-million bond issue aimed at 
providing housing for the homeless. Up to $27.5 million would come from this 
measure, including $25 million earmarked for upgrading residential hotels used 
by people with very low incomes and another $2.5 million destined for emergency 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of bond money actually spent on earthquake relief will depend on how 
much is sought by local governments and property owners, said Maureen Higgins, 
director of the state Department of Housing and Community Development. "We 
picked the programs that would be most relevant at this time for earthquake 
relief," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the homeless in Southern California are concerned that using the 
bond money for earthquake relief would deplete resources for people who lost 
their homes long before the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said Deukmejian has expressed a willingness to 
replace the money by increasing the amount of a $150-million bond measure 
planned for next year's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the bond money, Deukmejian's Finance Department has put on hold 
another $20 million needed to fund legislation previously passed by lawmakers 
and signed by the governor. Assemblywoman Speier released an internal 
Administration memo showing the intention to withhold the money from programs 
for AIDS victims, pregnant mothers and pesticide detection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is becoming pretty transparent," Speier said in an interview. 
"There is an effort under way to use existing general fund money and money 
appropriated for other state purposes to respond to the earthquake issues. It 
is a ripple effect from the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian spokesman Kevin Brett acknowledged that these funds might go to the 
earthquake relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The reserve and the funds that will be received from the sales tax increase 
are the primary methods of funding the earthquake relief," he said. "But that 
does not mean we aren't going to explore other methods as well. The bottom line 
is that we want to do whatever we possibly can to help the victims as quickly 
as we possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase, as now proposed, would cost Californians an extra 25 cents on 
every $100 of purchases -- or a nickel for every $20 spent. The statewide sales 
tax now stands at 6%. The increase would be in effect from Dec. 1, 1989, until 
Dec. 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the governor and legislative leaders to stick to their script 
-- a modest quarter-cent sales tax hike and a tightly written relief package -- 
left dozens of measures proposed by rank-and-file lawmakers on the cutting-room 
floor. It was not clear Friday whether those bills would be taken up even in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
One proposed bill, by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), would hold 
up work on double-decking the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles until the 
Legislature receives assurances from Caltrans that the structure could 
withstand an 8.3-magnitude earthquake. Waters said she wants to avoid a 
calamity comparable to the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Waters also made an effort to use the gathering of lawmakers to win back $24 
million cut by Deukmejian from family planning programs. Roberti and Brown 
agreed to Waters' request to convene a regular session of the Legislature 
concurrent with the special session. But it was unclear when that session would 
begin. It appeared, in any case, that Waters lacked the votes late Friday to 
restore the family planning money. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the battles over the sales tax measure, political skirmishes 
erupted on other parts of the leadership package Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One major battle involved the question of whether private, nonprofit 
institutions, including Stanford University, should be eligible for grants of 
taxpayer dollars to repair earthquake damage. A proposal moving through the 
Senate would give the private groups the same eligibility for funding that 
local public agencies have under current law. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal drew fire in the Senate Toxics and Public Safety Management 
Committee from Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who said there is so little money 
available that Stanford "shouldn't even be standing in line." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sen. Art Torres: "The quake has created a lifeboat situation. Right now, 
we have to serve as the captain in deciding who stays on and who gets off." 
Stanford and other private institutions, he said, would have to be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the committee voted to give private agencies a chance to obtain 
state aid only after public agencies have received all they needed. The 
committee also put private universities behind private hospitals on the 
priority list and established a $1-million cap on public aid to private 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY TAX LEVELS 
</P>
<P>
The California sales tax now stands at 6% on each dollar of sales, but voters 
in 13 of the state's 58 counties have voted additional levies for local 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Eight counties have added an additional half cent, bringing them to 6 1/2%. 
They are Fresno, Inyo, Los Angeles, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San 
Francisco and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Five other counties have added a full cent, bringing their sales tax to 7%. 
They are Alameda, Contra Costa, San Diego, San Mateo and Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in six counties will decide Tuesday whether to add half-cent sales tax 
increases for transportation projects: Monterey, Nevada, Orange, San 
Bernardino, San Francisco and Santa Barbara.

Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has fired the planning chief for the 
state-run economy and the foreign minister in yet another shake-up of top-level 
jobs, Romania's news agency said. Radu Balan was "released from his functions 
as president of the State Planning Committee by a presidential decree," 
Agerpres said in a report from Bucharest, monitored in Vienna. It later 
reported that Foreign Minister Ioan Totu was replaced by Ion Stoian.

ELECTIONS WILL BE WATCHED FOR ATTITUDES ON ABORTION, RACE

L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia bids to become the nation's first elected black 
governor and David N. Dinkins seeks distinction as New York's first black mayor 
in off-year voting Tuesday that will be watched for shifting sentiment on 
abortion as well as race. 
</P>
<P>
In another abortion-tinged contest, Democratic Rep. James J. Florio is heavily 
favored to break an eight-year Republican hold on the governor's office in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The heightened concern over abortion stems from a Supreme Court ruling last 
summer permitting states to impose greater restrictions on women seeking to 
terminate their pregnancies, and already the two parties are debating the 
political fallout. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic Party, said abortion has had an impact on 
the Virginia, New Jersey and New York races and added that Democratic 
candidates with their pro-choice views "are on the right side of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (President) Bush has dug himself a big hole that he's going to be 
unable to extricate himself from. He is taking a lot of Republicans down with 
him," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, without referring to any individual GOP 
candidate, "Where you get into trouble on abortion is when you do not clearly 
define your position, when you appear to be all over the lot on it." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who managed Bush's successful 1988 campaign, noted that Bush's 
opposition to abortion did not damage him last year. 
</P>
<P>
In other balloting Tuesday, 11 candidates are vying to replace Rep. Mickey 
Leland of Texas, killed last summer in a plane crash in Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
The line-up of big city elections includes Detroit, where 71-year-old Democrat 
Coleman Young seeks a fifth term, and Cleveland, where Democrats George Forbes 
and Michael White are staging a bare-knuckled political brawl for city hall. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Daniels is favored to win office as the first black mayor in mostly 
white New Haven, Conn., while Norm Rice is out for the same honor in Seattle 
against Republican Norm Jewett. 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign prelude to 1990 elections with 34 Senate seats, 36 governorships 
and 435 House seats, abortion has become a prominent issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue was cooler before" the Supreme Court's ruling, Atwater said, but 
added: "I maintain it is not going to be a national driving issue in 1990. It's 
going to be an issue on a race-by-race basis." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has campaigned personally for GOP candidates J. Marshall Coleman in 
Virginia, Rudolph Giuliani in New York and Rep. Jim Courter in New Jersey, 
including a swing into New Jersey and Virginia on Friday. He talked of drugs, 
crime and other "challenges of tomorrow" but steered clear of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is abortion more clearly -- or more surprisingly -- an issue than 
Virginia, where race was scarcely a factor until the campaign's final days. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder challenged a decade of political wisdom by taking the offensive with 
commercials on abortion on television, where pro-choice and right-to-life 
groups have both spent heavily on commercials as well. The issue has spilled 
over to at least one other race. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder launched television commercials more than a month ago, telling women 
that Coleman wanted to "take away your right to choose. . . . He wants to go 
back to outlawing abortion, even in cases of rape and incest." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sabato, University of Virginia political scientist, said Wilder's 
approach permitted him to gain support from voters who oppose government 
intervention in their lives and combine "the anti-government conservatism with 
his liberal base." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman declined to respond at first, instead charging his Democratic rival 
with trying to "spread fear." 
</P>
<P>
But Wilder surged to a lead in public opinion polls within a few weeks, leaving 
Coleman, a former attorney general who lost a gubernatorial bid eight years 
ago, to play catch-up in the final weeks of the race. He hit back with 
commercials questioning Wilder's suitability to serve, and on Friday, raised 
the issue of race by implication when he said Wilder was benefiting from a 
"double standard" in press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion has surfaced in greater and smaller degrees in other races: 
</P>
<P>
* Courter has softened his anti-abortion position in New Jersey and thus 
alienated the National Right to Life Committee, which hasn't given him its 
backing. Democrat Florio has a solid pro-choice position. 
</P>
<P>
* Giuliani softened his position as well in the New York race, arousing the ire 
of Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor. The GOP candidate issued a 
clarification last summer that said he accepted a woman's right to choose and 
would oppose making abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
* The issue spilled over to the lieutenant governor's race in Virginia, where 
Republican Edy Dalton aired a television commercial saying she was in favor of 
a woman's right to choose -- in cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
* OFF-YEAR DELUGE

SUSPECT DESCRIBES ATTACK ON JOGGER;

The teen-agers suspected of raping and beating a woman jogger in Central Park 
whooped with laughter and leaped into the air to celebrate the attack, one of 
the suspects said in a videotaped confession played Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was laughing," recalled Kevin Richardson, 15, one of six youths 
indicted for rape and attempted murder in the April 19 attack. 
</P>
<P>
In the 35-minute videotape, played at a pretrial hearing in state Supreme Court 
in Manhattan, Richardson described the woman -- nude, unconscious and sprawled 
on the ground -- and the youths cavorting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They was running around, leaping and stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer, the prosecutor questioning him on the 
videotape at the 24th Precinct, then asked him: "They felt pretty good about 
what they'd done?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," answered Richardson, a hulking teen-ager who has been described by 
other defendants as one of the leaders of the attack on the 29-year-old woman 
and one of the rapists. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street investment banker was left for dead in the wooded gully in 
Central Park. At the time, doctors feared that she would not survive and said 
her severe head wounds gave her only a slim chance of fully regaining her 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
However, a doctor familiar with the case now says that the woman has made a 
"remarkable recovery." The physician said she will likely have a "100% 
recovery" and is considering an offer to eventually go back to her job at 
Salomon Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said she will be a witness at trial this winter, although she has 
said that she has no recollection of the attack. She has been told what 
happened to her and understands how she became injured, investigators said.. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's left cheek was scratched by the woman, which authorities say is 
evidence of the struggle she put up when attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, however, denied taking part in the incident. He contends that he 
became involved only in an effort to stop the violence and, in the process, was 
scratched by her. 
</P>
<P>
He said he tried to intervene while another youth, Antron McCray, 15, was 
having intercourse with the woman as the others stood around watching. 
</P>
<P>
"I came over there and I was like trying to stop it. I got in the way and she 
scratched me," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he grabbed the woman's arm, claiming that the action was meant to stop 
the rape. 
</P>
<P>
A doubtful-sounding Lederer questioned him about the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"You grabbed her arm when you tried to stop it?" Lederer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Richardson replied.

NEWPORT-MESA RACE COMES TO A BOIL AT FORUM

<P>
One of the most contentious board races in the history of the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District continued Friday with a volley of heated charges 
exchanged over breakfast in the main ballroom of the exclusive Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Sherry Loofbourrow, documents in hand as her proof, charged that 
her challenger, Jo Ellen Allen, belongs to an extremist group that tried to 
have the novel "Of Mice and Men" and the movie "Romeo and Juliet" banned at 
school districts across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, she knows nothing," Allen shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Leece debated incumbent Rod MacMillian as to whether his 24 years on the 
board was long enough. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the challengers accused the incumbents of being a cozy club that has 
kept the public at arm's length on important issues; not so, responded the 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session, the six candidates discussed a 
variety of issues, including sex education, censorship, reassignment of 
principals and how much say parents have had in running the district's 26 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 to 150 people were at the forum, whose host was the Newport Harbor 
Area Chamber of Commerce. Lawyer Jim Parker moderated the event, one of the 
last before the at-large election Tuesday in the district. About 16,000 
students from Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Corona del Mar attend district 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
At the forum were incumbent MacMillan, 62, of Corona del Mar and challenger 
Leece, 41, of Costa Mesa; incumbent Judith A. Franco, 52, and challenger Karen 
Evarts, 48, both of Newport Beach; incumbent Loofbourrow, 48, and challenger 
Allen, 43, both of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action Friday, the 700-member Newport Mesa Federation of Teachers 
cast its support to incumbents Franco, Loofbourrow and MacMillian. It was the 
first endorsement in the teachers union's 21-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"It was felt that because of the affiliations of some of the opposing 
candidates with organizations which advocate censorship of textbooks, class 
content and libraries, that the interests of students, teachers and the 
community will best be served by the incumbents," the association announced in 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
During the Balboa Bay Club forum, Loofbourrow said Allen is a member of Eagle 
Forum, a national political organization that the California Congress of 
Parents, Teachers and Students Inc. (now the proper name for the state 
organization still known as the PTA) has labeled extremist. Allen is state 
president of the conservative women's organization founded by Phyllis Schlafly, 
a proponent of traditional roles for women. 
</P>
<P>
According to the PTA, Eagle Forum has tried to persuade school districts to ban 
districts John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men," director Franco Zeffirelli's film 
version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and Shel Silverstein's poetry book, 
"A Light in the Attic." The PTA also contends that Eagle Forum has worked 
closely with Citizens for Excellence in Education, a group based in Costa Mesa 
that argues that public schools are dominated by an atheist ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said that neither she nor the state branch of Eagle Forum participated in 
any attempt to censor books or films. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not an extremist, no matter what the PTA says," said Allen, who 
emphasized her 15-year teaching career and who is now a lecturer at USC. 
"Censorship is not my job. I have no hidden agenda, and sex education is not 
the reason I am running. Academic excellence is." 
</P>
<P>
Allen and also Leece have said, however, that they want abstinence to be the 
chief focus of the district's sex education programs, and they contend that 
some films and books are not appropriate for some schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Both are backed by the Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education, 
a group that supports "traditional values" and that wants to ban such films as 
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Breakfast Club" from classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Board and the Public 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the matter of parents' relationship with the district, Franco denied 
charges by Evarts, Leece and Allen that the board always votes unanimously and 
that it neither considers nor respects public opinion on major policy 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a tremendous amount of input from teachers, parents and students," 
Franco said. "Our decisions are reached after lengthy deliberation. It takes 
time to be conversant with the issues before we vote." 
</P>
<P>
According to a high-ranking district official, the district has stressed 
parental involvement for years, and parents have been heavily involved in 
advisory councils for developing a sex education curriculum. Parents can also 
review class materials and keep their children out of certain courses, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything we are accused of not doing," Loofbourrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Leece: "I would like to go back to the Founding Fathers of this country, 
when parents were the primary teachers of their children. We have gotten away 
from this, and it has caused teen-age pregnancy, promiscuity and drugs. We need 
to work with parents." 
</P>
<P>
Leece, who describes herself as a fundamentalist Christian, teaches two 
offspring at home and sends a third to Calvary Chapel High School in Santa Ana. 
She says she represents thousands of parents who are dissatisfied with public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"You must take part in the system if you want to run," MacMillian said. Leece 
"has never taken part." 
</P>
<P>
Franco faces a strong challenger in Evarts, a Newport Beach library board 
member who has raised the most campaign contributions -- $12,000 -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Evarts said she would like to replace Superintendent John Nicoll 
and put fresh blood in the administration. She said Nicoll and the board were 
especially rude in their dealings with parents and students when they decided 
to swap principals at two high schools in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents said some mistakes were made but that the principals, who were 
looking for jobs outside the district before the swap, are now satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how district expansion could be accomplished in light of the public's 
aversion to taxes, Allen said she would have to meet with parents to see what 
they would like. 
</P>
<P>
Loofbourrow said the board is now researching ways to accommodate rising 
enrollment, that it is looking at land management methods, refurbishing schools 
and working with the Irvine Co. to develop new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the subject of MacMillian's 24 years on the board, Parker asked him 
whether he has served long enough, as Leece contends he has. MacMillian 
responded that he has been involved with youth organizations, schools and 
sports since 1947 and that he has no intention of losing the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not tired," he said.

<P>
Orange County teachers, having honed their political skills in several recent 
elections, are gunning for incumbents in three elementary and high school board 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapters of the California Teachers Assn. are pumping in dollars and 
volunteers to unseat incumbents in the Anaheim City School District and the 
Orange Unified and Santa Ana Unified school districts. A fourth district, 
Huntington Beach Union High School, features the union in strong defense of the 
incumbents it helped elect four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teachers are out there and working," said Norma Potter, an Anaheim High 
School special education teacher and chairwoman of the CTA's service center in 
Orange. "There's a long history of this, of people working for their candidates 
and succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
Recent Orange County school board elections reflect the increasing 
aggressiveness of local teachers' organizations, and the CTA has proven that it 
can deliver votes. Just ask members of the Huntington Beach school board who 
were tossed out in 1984, or trustees in Santa Ana Unified who in 1986 were 
swept out of office in Orange County's largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
In those races, unions gave thousands of 
</P>
<P>
dollars to the successful candidates. But even more important, they gave their 
endorsed challengers a guaranteed pool of volunteers to help canvass 
neighborhoods and work telephone banks. School board elections tend to produce 
low turnouts, so volunteer efforts, if they can muster even a few hundred 
votes, can have a decisive impact. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Richards, a Santa Ana Unified trustee who watched as three of his 
colleagues were defeated in 1986, is seeking a third four-year term. He said he 
has never received the union's endorsement, and he proudly shuns it, refusing 
even to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly feel it's a conflict of interest," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other officials who did not receive union endorsements, Richards said he 
does not believe the union will play a decisive role in this year's Santa Ana 
campaign. "Orange County is not a union county or a union society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders, while denying that Orange County voters rebel against organized 
labor, carefully stress that teachers have been able to distinguish themselves 
from most organized labor groups in terms of their popular support. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most observers acknowledge that a union endorsement comes with risks as 
well as benefits. Some voters do not like unions, and in districts where labor 
disputes have prompted strikes or other work actions, even otherwise neutral 
voters are often antagonized by the union's role. 
</P>
<P>
That may be the case in Orange Unified, where a seven-day teachers' strike last 
year frayed relations with district officials and tested parents' patience. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of backlash from that strike," said Jane McCracken, an 
incumbent trustee who was named to the board in February to fill an unexpired 
term and must run for election to complete the term's remaining two years. 
McCracken, in fact, is counting on that backlash, as she joins other incumbents 
seeking reelection in that district who are opposed by the union. 
</P>
<P>
The unions, however, are pouring on their influence. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve McDonald, executive director of the Orange Unified Education 
Assn., the teachers' union has actively pushed its slate in Orange and doled 
out a total of $14,000 among its four candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the union representing other school district employees is backing three 
of the same challengers on the teacher-endorsed slate. That union, which is 
affiliated with the local chapter of the California School Employees Assn., is 
protesting a breakdown in salary negotiations with the district and 
demonstrated outside a recent board meeting. Several members spent Friday 
stuffing mailers for one of their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent school board President Sandy G. Englander bristles at the power of 
the organized labor groups and acknowledged that it has made some school board 
races too close to call. Englander was not endorsed by either union, but her 
opponent, college instructor John Hurley, didn't get the nod either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are going to be some very, very close elections," Englander 
predicted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, the union's position and its support of two challengers boils down 
to a relatively straightforward disagreement with incumbents. For several 
years, despite union urging, the Anaheim school board has refused to allow an 
election to create an "agency shop." Under such an arrangement, all district 
teachers, whether or not they choose to join the union, would be charged dues 
to support the union's collective bargaining work. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an important issue to us," Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
Two incumbents are seeking reelection in the Anaheim district, the county's 
largest elementary school district. Those incumbents, Celia Dougherty and Betty 
Patterson, are facing off against four challengers for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those challengers, Anaheim Police Officer Lou Lopez and realtor-educator 
Barbara C. Gonzalez, are receiving union support. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers welcome the high-profile role assumed by the union, but that 
feeling is not always shared by school administrators. Several high-ranking 
school officials in various districts said the unions have made it difficult 
for boards to govern objectively and have turned salary debates into hot 
political confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
While the unions have as many passionate opponents as they do defenders, the 
fact that they prompt such strong reactions is evidence that they are a force 
to be reckoned with. And both sides agree that they are not about to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they're teachers doesn't prevent them from being citizens," 
Anaheim City School District Supt. Meliton Lopez said. "They're intelligent, 
and they know how to set up a campaign. I expect they'll keep doing it."

GROUP SUES TO BLOCK PROJECT ON WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Seal Beach environmental group filed suit Friday to block construction of a 
long-debated 355-home development planned in the city on the old Hellman Ranch, 
a stretch of degraded wetlands that once teemed with bird and plant life. 
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands Restoration Society, a grass-roots organization of about 150 that 
formed to oppose the 149-acre housing project, hopes to limit construction to 
far fewer units on just 20 acres overlooking the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using any legal means we can to protect the wetlands," said Galen F. 
Ambrose, co-founder of the group. "We'll fight it as far as we have to." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Mola Development Co., the Newport Beach-based firm planning the 
development, could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed 
in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But city leaders in Seal Beach, which was also named in the suit, expressed 
confidence that the legal challenge could be rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the city attorney's public conversations with us, I have a lot of 
confidence that the city would prevail," said Councilman Joe Hunt, who voted 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The housing project, which is north of Pacific Coast Highway and just west of 
Seal Beach Boulevard, has created controversy since plans were first revealed 
more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mola Development originally proposed a 770-unit project for the site. But that 
plan, which included more than 600 condominium units, was strongly opposed by 
residents and was voted down by the state Coastal Commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
The developer countered by introducing the scaled-back proposal, which includes 
plans to build a 15-acre park, give the city $1 million and restore and enlarge 
the degraded wetland. The work would include restoring tidal flow to the 
silt-choked basin, replanting native flora and expanding the wetlands from its 
present 26 acres to more than 36 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach council members reviewed the project during a special session Oct. 
14 and approved it. The development is scheduled to go before the Coastal 
Commission Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
While the Wetlands Restoration Society is concerned about the environmental 
damage the housing project would do to the remaining stretches of wetlands on 
the property, the group chose in its lawsuit to attack the development mostly 
on other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The group argues in the lawsuit that the council's approval of the development 
is inconsistent with the city's housing element and general plan, two key 
municipal blueprints for the future. In addition, the suit contends the 
development should not be allowed to go forward because the city's housing 
element has not been properly updated as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose said the group and its attorney, Los Angeles lawyer Jonathan 
Lehrer-Graiwer, decided that a legal attack over the environmental issues 
"would not be worth the paper it's written on" because the judiciary in Orange 
County is "all pro-development." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have argued that the wetlands once stretched across 100 acres 
in the area, but have been reduced to a quarter of that by illegal dumping of 
dirt in the area. Mola officials, however, dispute such claims, saying the 
wetlands never occupied that much space during this century. 
</P>
<P>
Although the wetlands have been greatly disturbed by mankind in recent years, 
it still plays host to the Belding's savanna sparrow, an endangered species in 
California, according to Audubon Society members. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose said the group hopes to restore the wetlands nearly to its original 
form. The parcel is a key link to between 300 and 400 acres of ecologically 
sensitive marshes and other habitat farther inland that the environmental group 
hopes to save, he said.

COPTER PILOT PICKED UP BOSS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach police officer who flew one of the department's 
helicopters to Riverside County went at the request of a boss -- an off-duty 
sergeant -- and the sergeant's female companion after their car broke down 
there, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, City Administrator Paul E. Cook said, the pilot will probably 
receive no more than a reprimand, while the sergeant could receive more severe 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're blaming the sergeant," Cook said. He refused to release the names of 
either of the city employees involved in the incident last week. 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, officials had confirmed only that a police pilot took an 
unauthorized flight to the desert community of Indio to pick up an off-duty 
officer and his girlfriend. They never mentioned, however, that the officer 
being picked up was one of the pilot's bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said earlier this week that the trip violated city policy on the use of 
the department's three police helicopters, which cost hundreds of dollars an 
hour to operate. Ferrying the female passenger aboard the craft gave the city 
an unnecessary insurance risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said that in the wake of the incident, the 
department has already changed the rules regarding use of the helicopter. Now, 
the bureau commander, a lieutenant, must authorize cross-county flights. 
Previously, those flights outside of the city could be approved by the chief 
pilot, a sergeant, according to Lowenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He said one of the employees involved in the incident has been placed on leave 
with pay pending outcome of the internal affairs investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot who made the trip to Indio tried to justify the trip as a training 
flight, required under Federal Aviation Administration rules in order for 
pilots to remain credentialed for flights outside of the city.

ARGUMENT ESCALATES INTO FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An argument between a barmaid and a patron escalated into the fatal shooting of 
one man and wounding of another early Friday at a Santa Ana tavern, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the two argued, fistfights broke out among the customers at the My Place 
bar on South Standard Avenue. When the bartender ordered the rowdy patrons to 
leave, one of the customers apparently opened fire on the others outside, said 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, Toribio Silva Santillan, 33, of Santa Ana, managed to stumble 
back into the bar to call police despite a chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
Santillan then went outside again, where police found both him and another man 
who had been shot in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Santillan was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he underwent 
surgery. The other man, whose identity was unknown to police, was pronounced 
dead at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.

PHONE FUND-RAISERS MISLEAD, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Police Department is warning residents to beware of people soliciting money 
over the telephone in the name of the Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
According to Andy Gonis, police spokesman, the majority of complaints have come 
from residents who have been contacted by a firm that is soliciting 
contributions for another police department. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said some people have complained that the solicitors portray themselves 
either as Newport police officers or representatives of the department. Gonis 
said they are not. The Newport Beach Police Employees Assn. does not 
participate in any type of fund-raising by telephone or door-to-door 
solicitation, according to Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis noted, however, that some police organizations do solicit by telephone 
and that people should take the time to verify that all solicitations are 
legal.

CONTRACTOR ARRESTED IN ALLEGED BRIBE TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Garden Grove electrical contractor was arrested Friday on suspicion of 
attempting to bribe a city inspector to overlook substandard wiring that led to 
a neon sign outside an unfinished jewelry store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Berhman Bert Sheidaye, 44, of Fullerton was taken into custody by Huntington 
Beach police officers after allegedly giving $50 to city inspector James 
Lawrence during an electrical inspection on Thursday, Police Sgt. Louis Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was made after Lawrence, who carried a hidden microphone, met with 
Sheidaye on Friday and recorded a conversation, during which Sheidaye allegedly 
insisted that Lawrence keep the money, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told Mr. Lawrence, 'It's yours. It's just between us,' " Ochoa said in 
recounting the tape-recorded conversation between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Sheidaye, after being released from the Huntington Beach Jail on his own 
recognizance, said that the incident amounted to a misunderstanding at best. He 
also charged that the inspector was out to discredit him because of a long 
series of run-ins that the two have had over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"This man, he does not know nothing," Sheidaye said. "All the contractors hate 
him. . . . He tried to destroy me." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ochoa, Sheidaye, owner of the Garden Grove-based Sunlight Signs, 
was told by Lawrence that the electrical work he had performed on a neon sign 
at Noal's Jewelry on Edinger Avenue would have to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just not up to code," Ochoa said. "The way it was, it could have 
started a fire." 
</P>
<P>
After Lawrence said the work would have to be changed, Sheidaye, according to 
Ochoa, allegedly tried to hand him the $50, but the inspector refused to take 
it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sheidaye continued to press the money into Lawrence's hand, Ochoa 
said. Finally, Ochoa alleged, Sheidaye slipped the money into the inspector's 
back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrence was just fed up," Ochoa said. "He came directly to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said that police officials urged Lawrence to meet with Sheidaye on Friday 
morning and to carry a hidden microphone. "We told him to just try and give the 
money back," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
During the second meeting, Lawrence told Sheidaye that he could not keep the 
money and suggested that the contractor take it back, Ochoa said. "The guy 
(Sheidaye) essentially said, 'No. You keep it. No one else will know.' " Ochoa 
related. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Ochoa said, four officers who had been listening to the 
conversation moved in and arrested Sheidaye. 
</P>
<P>
Sheidaye said that he gave the money to Lawrence for reinspection fees. He said 
that $20 was owed Lawrence for the Thursday inspection, and $30 was to cover 
the Friday morning inspection. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Lawrence what the $30 was for, Sheidaye said that he jokingly 
answered, "You can have it for a drink or for the next" reinspection. JAMES M.

1ST OF 5 SHELTERS FOR HOMELESS COMPLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Construction was completed this week on the first of five Orange County 
shelters to be renovated or built as part of HomeAid, the Building Industry 
Assn. of Orange County's nonprofit program to assist the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The project is part of Homeless Awareness Week, designated by the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors for Nov. 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lennon, Building Industry Assn. director of community affairs, said the 
$65,000 renovation of the decade-old, 36-bed Interval House in Midway City was 
done primarily by Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp.of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"They did the shelter's whole wish list and then more," he said of the building 
company. "This stuff is just contagious. It's beginning to create a groundswell 
of understanding of the homeless situation." HomeAid concentrates assistance 
efforts on the "transitionally homeless," defined as people who are 
hard-working, often middle-class members of society who, as victims of 
circumstance such as job loss or catastrophic illness, have found themselves 
without homes, spokesman Bob Albertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these are families," said Albertson, who is also president of Presley 
of Southern California, a home-building firm. "We need to take as many people 
off the streets as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The building association, a 1,100-member organization representing builders, 
developers and affiliated businesses, chose one shelter in each county 
supervisorial district for renovation or new construction. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 subcontractors, builders and consultants have donated time, labor 
and materials to the ongoing program, which started in June and will be 
completed next year, Albertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Albertson estimates that 8,000 to 10,000 people in Orange County are without 
shelter each night. Half of them are children. 
</P>
<P>
Other shelters to be renovated, most of which provide free housing for 60 to 90 
days, are the two-apartment, five-bedroom Thomas House in Garden Grove, the 
20-bed New Vista Shelter in Fullerton and the almost-completed Anchor House in 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
In El Modena, the proposed $200,000 El Modena House, to include three 
one-story, low-rent duplexes, will be completed next spring, Albertson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, all 18 shelters in 
Orange County are full and turn people away. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather, task force chairman, said the building association will add 80 
beds to the existing inventory of 600. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a breakthrough," Mather said. "Normally we only get 100 beds a year 
through all other sources. To increase capacity by this many from the 
(building) trades alone is a major step in the right direction." LESLIE HERZOG

COUNTY REPUBLICANS ARE DIVIDED ON NEED FOR MEASURE M ROAD TAX; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE SPECTRUM OF OPINIONS WITHIN THE PARTY, GOP LEADERS SAY, IS 
PARTIALLY A REFLECTION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITS TWO MAJOR FACTIONS, THE 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The prospect of a tax increase weighed against the county's burgeoning traffic 
problems has divided Orange County Republicans over Measure M on Tuesday's 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Orange County Republican Assembly, after listening to experts 
explain the measure's half-cent sales tax increase to raise $3.1 billion in 
traffic improvements, overwhelmingly voted it down, 34 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party's Lincoln Club considered the same proposal and donated 
$25,000 to the campaign for passage of the measure on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Republican Central Committee has decided not to take a position. 
But the all-Republican Board of Supervisors is unanimous in its support. And in 
Sacramento, only one of the county's legislators has come out against the 
measure, although some are taking no position. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not sure about it," said Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Fountain 
Valley). "I've had to tell people frankly, I'm ambivalent. I really am not 
prepared to say it's all good or all bad." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Measure M say they have not put any pressure on legislators to 
silence any possible opposition. But leaders of the campaign against the 
measure said they think politics is involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real obvious why they're not taking a position," said Jerry Yudelson, a 
leader of the anti-M campaign. "When you're looking at $2 million in developer 
contributions (for the M campaign) nobody who needs that money (source) for 
their (future) elections is going to go against it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the varied political opinions are not expected to have any impact on 
Measure M's success or failure at the polls, say proponents of the measure. 
Voters look to their party for advice on candidates, but not to a significant 
degree on ballot measures, said Bruce Nestande, campaign chairman for Measure 
M. 
</P>
<P>
"On a ballot measure or public policy such as this the (party's position) means 
very little," he said. "The voter out there is pretty independent." 
</P>
<P>
What the spectrum of opinions does demonstrate, say GOP leaders, is that Orange 
County's Republican Party is not a monolith. It also reveals the party's two 
major factions: the business community and the philosophical conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it highlights the fact that there are different stripes within the 
Republican Party," said Harvey Englander, a Newport Beach political consultant. 
"There's a difference between the pragmatic Republicans and the philosophical 
Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Party members usually agree on their choices for major state or national 
offices, he said. But on local issues, there are several camps. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that there are active and good Republicans on both sides," said 
Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas Fuentes. "We view it as a totally 
nonpartisan kind of issue." 
</P>
<P>
Measure M is intended to raise the $3.1 billion over the next 20 years to widen 
freeways, create "super streets," explore a public train system and improve 
congested intersections. To satisfy those who distrust government, the measure 
also has provisions that regulate development and establish a citizens' 
committee to oversee the distribution of the tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the county's Republican Party are business leaders -- including 
developers -- who fear that the economy and their ability sell products or 
houses will suffer if traffic does not improve. As a result, the bulk of about 
$1.8 million raised for the campaign was donated by developers. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of Orange County's most conservative leaders seem to be 
reading President Bush's lips. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining its rejection of the measure, the Republican Assembly said 
"members are skeptical of tax increases in general. . . . The current 
transportation mess is not due to a lack of funds, but rather to a lack of will 
and competence on the part of government officials." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has strongly endorsed the measure. Party 
leaders are rolling up their sleeves to work telephone banks, raise money and 
get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Mike Balmages agreed with his 
counterpart, Fuentes, that Measure M is a nonpartisan issue. But, he said, "I 
don't see anything inappropriate about the parties taking positions on the most 
important issue in Orange County this election. I think it's a cop-out by the 
Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Orange County's conservative legislators who have declined to state 
a position on the measure include Assemblymen Ross Johnson (R-La Havra), Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and Frizzelle. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's Assembly delegation, only Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has 
spoken publicly in favor of the measure. Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los 
Alamitos) is the only legislator from Orange County to publicly oppose the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be people who will attack me because I'm supporting the 
tax," said Ferguson, who announced Wednesday that he will run for the seat of 
retiring state Sen. William R. Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) next spring. "But 
if they knew the facts, they'd support it too. They're just sticking their head 
in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pringle: "There are certain things that your position is very valuable on 
and there's other things where I don't think it's important." He added, 
however, "I personally have a lot of problems with (Measure M). I probably will 
be voting no." 
</P>
<P>
The two Orange County senators who are competing in the Republican primary for 
the lieutenant governor's seat -- John Seymour (R-Anaheim) and Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) -- both said they support the measure. Both also supported 
Measure A, the 1984 proposal that called for a one-cent sales tax to pay for 
new roads that was overwhelmingly defeated at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"While no one likes advocating a tax, the realities are that without additional 
funding for transportation we're going to continue to sit in gridlock," 
Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour noted: "Any time you take a position in support of a tax it's 
unpopular. On the other hand, I don't look at my job here as running a 
popularity contest. My job is to take positions and make stands. I don't mind 
being counted on this."

Police have released an artist's sketch of a suspect wanted in the killing of a 
market clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Yeon Kon Chang, 49, was fatally injured in a confrontation with a man he chased 
from the J.R. Market, 2612 W. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim, on Oct. 22. Chang 
apparently caught the man trying to steal from the market, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang died at UCI Medical Center shortly after he was found about 8:20 p.m. in 
the market's parking lot. He had been hit over the head. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as being a teen-ager with shoulder-length blond hair. 
He was between 5 feet, 7 inches tall and 5 feet, 9 inches tall and appeared to 
weigh about 140 pounds, according to Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth.

ARENA'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MINIMAL, CONSULTANT DECLARES ; 
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM: CITY BEATS SANTA ANA IN A RACE TO COMPLETE A SPORTS FACILITY REPORT, 
BUT MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS FEAR INCREASED NOISE AND TRAFFIC.

<TEXT>
<P>
A consultant declared Friday that this city's proposed indoor sports arena 
would cause no major environmental problems, although nearby residents may 
object to its presence, as well as to the noise and traffic it could generate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as significant as the environmental issues, however, is the fact that 
Anaheim has completed its environmental report ahead of Santa Ana, which is 
compiling a similar document for a proposed, nearly identical, indoor sports 
arena in that city. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Santa Ana hope that building an arena will lure a professional 
basketball or hockey franchise. But backers of both plans generally concede 
that only one of the cities is likely to obtain a pro team, which experts 
consider essential if either arena is to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a surprise . . . they (Anaheim officials) are that far along," said 
Santa Ana planner Jeff Rice, who had thought Santa Ana was in the lead in 
preparing its environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Friday that Santa Ana's report probably will not be ready to release 
for public review until December. 
</P>
<P>
Most environmental concerns posed by the construction of Anaheim's 20,000-seat, 
$85-million arena can be "mitigated to a level of insignificance," according to 
the 1 1/2-inch thick report prepared for the city by Phillips Brandt Reddick of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But the report concedes that surrounding residents may regard the proposed 
100-foot-high structure, its sprawling parking lots and the attendant noise at 
the site as significantly adverse to their environment. Also, even after 
efforts to mitigate increased traffic created by the arena, "the level of 
service at some intersections will remain unacceptable," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, residents opposed to noise and traffic have been instrumental 
in defeating prior proposals for sports arenas in Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline S. Weber, a resident of a mobile home park immediately adjacent to the 
arena site near Anaheim Stadium, said Friday that she is not pleased with the 
idea of yet another sports facility in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us really like the idea (because of) the noise and the 
traffic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When there are games at Anaheim Stadium, "they park all along Douglass Road 
over here," she said. "It's quite congested even then, so I can imagine what it 
will be like when they have the arena." 
</P>
<P>
To minimize the visual impact of the towering arena and its parking lots, the 
arena project will include a 10-foot-wide landscaped buffer at the north and 
western edges of the site, which abuts the mobile home park, the report said. A 
six-foot wall also will be constructed next to the mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that there would be significant detrimental effects if the 
city failed to relocate or compensate the Phoenix Club, a German-American 
social group, and the Christian Co. Inc., a wholesale roofing business, which 
now occupy the site of the arena. However, the report points out that the city 
has agreed to relocate both. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council will conduct hearings on the environmental report 
after a public review period. Comments on the report will also be solicited 
from other interested public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's arena is to be located on 7.6 acres near Anaheim Stadium on Douglass 
Road north of Katella Avenue. The city agreed to purchase the property Oct. 20 
for $8 million from the Phoenix Club. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim hopes to break ground at the construction site in January. As proposed, 
the arena would be ready for the fall 1991 National Hockey League season. 
</P>
<P>
According to the consultant's report, the Anaheim arena could be expected to 
operate 162 days a year, 45 of them for basketball games and 40 for concerts. 
An average of 34,942 persons per week would attend functions at the arena, 
which also will feature family shows, circuses, and tennis and boxing matches. 
</P>
<P>
Parking for 2,900 vehicles would be provided on 17 acres along the Santa Ana 
River east of the arena, and 1,200 more spaces would be located south of 
Katella Avenue near Anaheim Stadium.

STEIN-BRIEF MAY BUY SITE AFTER FAILED QINTEX DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE DANA POINT DEVELOPER BEGAN TALKS REGARDING THE HEADLANDS 
SEASIDE PARCEL FRIDAY, NOT LONG AFTER QINTEX'S $115-MILLION DEAL FELL THROUGH.

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dust hasn't yet cleared from a big real estate deal that went bust in this 
southern Orange County beach town, and a local developer is already trying to 
buy the seaside parcel involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Stein-Brief Group, a Dana Point development company, is talking to 
Chandler-Sherman Corp. about buying a 115-acre bluff-top property called the 
Headlands, real estate sources said Friday. Stein-Brief is contemplating 
building a resort hotel on the choice tract. 
</P>
<P>
The talks come after an announcement Thursday that Qintex, the Australian 
resort and entertainment company, backed out of a $115-million commitment to 
buy the Headlands, where it planned to build part of a $1-billion resort and 
residential project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret we were interested in it before Qintex bought it," said a 
spokesman for Stein-Brief. "That's all we can say right now." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler-Sherman executives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The renewed interest by Stein-Brief could turn the development of the Dana 
Point resort into a real estate version of musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
In partnership with Hawaiian resort builder Christopher B. Hemmeter, 
Stein-Brief in July sold Qintex a second parcel in the Monarch Beach 
neighborhood of Dana Point for $132 million. Qintex planned to build the resort 
on both the Headlands and Monarch Beach parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex has suffered several financial setbacks in recent weeks. The company was 
unable to obtain financing to complete a $1.5-billion acquisition of MGM/United 
Artists film studios. Then a U.S. subsidiary declared bankruptcy. Recently 
Qintex announced it was drastically restructuring itself by selling assets, 
including three major resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The company bowed out of the Headlands deal when it missed a $3-million payment 
to extend an option to buy the property. Chandler-Sherman was to obtain 
development approvals by the time the balance of the purchase price was paid by 
1991. Qintex also forfeited $12 million already paid toward purchase of the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The company had to back out of the Headlands deal because its bankers refused 
to advance Qintex more money due to concerns about its heavy debt load and 
overall financial condition, a source familiar with the company said. Among 
other things, the lenders are deciding what parts of the company -- and 
possibly whether all of it -- should be sold to pay its debts, an Australian 
stock analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're selling basically anything they can get money for," said Edward 
Falkiner, head of research at Australian stockbroker Ord Minnett's New York 
office. "There's talk today they may pull the plug completely." 
</P>
<P>
In a terse release Thursday, Qintex said it would "maintain ownership" of the 
Monarch Beach property. But real estate sources doubt Qintex will go forward 
with its development plans and would likely sell the property, possibly to 
Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
There is even speculation in the real estate community that the previous owners 
of the Monarch Beach property -- Stein-Brief and Hemmeter Development Corp. -- 
may be tempted to try buying the land back cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex offered the two companies $100 million more than they paid for the 232 
acres two years ago, for a total of $132 million. Unlike the Headlands deal, 
Qintex bought the property outright instead of optioning it and paid almost the 
entire price in cash, sources said. So both Hemmeter and Stein-Brief are 
sitting on a lot of money that could be used to buy property. 
</P>
<P>
Both Stein-Brief and Hemmeter officials said it's too early to speculate on 
whether either company would be interested in buying back the Monarch Beach 
property, where they previously planned a posh resort hotel. Hemmeter once 
called the property one of the finest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always thought it was a tremendous piece of property," said President 
Tom Robinson. "But it's premature to say we'd be interested in it again." 
</P>
<P>
And Hemmeter has some problems of its own. The company is rethinking a plan to 
build a resort in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricane Hugo and because of 
the reluctance of banks to lend in the area. 
</P>
<P>
And its resort in Indian Wells near Palm Springs is tied up in red tape with 
local government and is behind schedule. Because nothing is happening with 
those two resorts, the company laid off 150 of the 350 employees in its Hawaii 
headquarters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate observers said the Japanese, who are avid investors in resorts, are 
also likely buyers. Two Japanese companies already own half of Qintex's two 
resorts in Australia and one in Hawaii, sold to them in the spring during an 
earlier financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies -- consumer credit company Nippon Shinpan Co. and the giant 
trading concern Mitsui and Co. -- also got first crack at buying a half 
interest in Qintex's Dana Point resort as part of the earlier deal. Those 
companies also could be interested in Qintex's resorts in Australia and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't surprise me if Mitsui and Nippon Shinpan are talking about buying 
it all," said a company source.

GATEWAY COMMUNICATIONS ADOPTS A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 
</P>

<P>
Gateway Communications Inc. said Friday that it has adopted a shareholder 
rights plan intended to make a hostile takeover of the company more difficult 
to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Schneider, Gateway's chief financial officer, said the action was taken 
because the company believes its stock is priced below its market value, not as 
a response to any specific takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that on a long-term basis our stock is undervalued," Schneider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway stock, which traded as high as $17 per share in 1986, has floundered 
around the $2 mark during the past year. On Friday, the stock closed at $2.0625 
per share, down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Because an undervalued stock makes a company more attractive as an acquisition 
target, it is not uncommon for firms to adopt anti-takeover plans when they 
believe their stock is bargain-priced. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schneider maintained that Gateway is not responding to an imminent 
takeover threat, he did note that a New York-based investment group, Centennial 
Associates, recently acquired a 5% stake in the company. But he said the group 
has told the company that the purchase was made for investment purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
The rights plan "will give the board the ability to negotiate" with a party 
attempting an unfriendly takeover, Schneider said. The plan gives current 
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at a set price. It would go into 
effect in the event that a party acquired 30% or more of Gateway common stock 
or announced a tender offer for at least 30% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"The board intends for the rights to enable all shareholders to realize the 
full long-term value of their shares in the event of an acquisition of the 
company," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
"The rights do not deter takeover attempts but should encourage any interested 
acquirer to negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover." 
</P>
<P>
A number of Orange County companies have adopted anti-takeover plans during the 
past year, among them Western Digital Corp. and AST Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway, whose sales were $16.8 million for 1988, manufactures communication 
products known as local area networks that enable personal computers to talk to 
each other and to share printers and other peripheral equipment. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Gateway earned $755,793 on revenue of $19.7 
million, up from earnings of $514,725 on revenue of $11.7 million for the same 
period last year.

High Occupancy: The Ramada Maingate Anaheim has ended its first year of 
operations with a better-than-expected 71% occupancy level, hotel officials 
recently announced. 
</P>
<P>
The 467-room hotel had projected occupancy would reach the 60%-65% range from 
August, 1988, through the end of this summer, spokesman Jeff Adler said. 
Location and an aggressive marketing effort combined to push the property past 
its goal, Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel caters mostly to families, offering such unusual amenities as room 
service from a nearby McDonald's restaurant. Hotel guests can have their choice 
of a conventional room service menu or Big Macs, fries and other McDonald's 
fare -- brought for an extra $1 charge.

COURT OKS SETTLEMENT OF SUIT OVER POLYGRAPH TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Francisco Superior Court judge Friday approved settlement of a statewide 
lawsuit against Crazy Shirts, a Tustin-based chain of T-shirt stores accused of 
illegally requiring store management applicants to take lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
Jocelyn D. Larkin, who represented the plaintiffs in the class-action suit 
filed last year, said that under the settlement, Crazy Shirts employees and job 
applicants who were required to take polygraph tests will be awarded damages 
ranging from $800 to $7,000 each. About 30 to 40 people are affected, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, Crazy Shirts is prohibited from asking or requiring 
employees or applicants to take lie detector tests for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, employers cannot require that workers take a lie detector 
test as a condition of being hired or keeping their jobs. Larkin said that 
although an employer can request an employee to take a polygraph test, it is 
illegal for him to take adverse action against someone who refuses. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy Shirts, operated by the Mainland Co., has 17 stores scattered throughout 
California, including outlets in Laguna Beach, Santa Ana, Newport Beach and 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mainland Co. President Steve Moder on Friday denied that the company had done 
anything illegal in using polygraph testing. He said "nobody was ever turned 
down" for employment or a raise for not taking the test. 
</P>
<P>
Moder said that although the company agreed to pay damages, "basically there 
was no admission of guilt. It was just to get the thing settled." 
</P>
<P>
However, Larkin said her client, David DeFelice of San Francisco, claims that 
in April, 1988 -- a month after he was hired as a salesman -- he was told by 
company managers that he would not be promoted unless he took a lie detector 
test. DeFelice refused. As a result, he said, he was told he would never be 
promoted. 
</P>
<P>
After filing the lawsuit, DeFelice was so harassed by management, Larkin said, 
that he quit his job at Crazy Shirts. Larkin said that in recognition of 
DeFelice's "trouble in taking on the case," he was awarded $25,000 by the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who took a polygraph in an attempt to gain employment or a promotion at 
Crazy Shirts will get $800, she said. Those who failed the test and thus were 
denied a job will receive $5,000 and those who refused to take it will get 
$7,500, she added.

FEISTY 'SOCIAL SECURITY' IS LOADED WITH GAGS, LESSON ON LOVE'S MAGIC

<P>
Andrew Bergman, the author of "Social Security," which opened at the Moulton 
Playhouse on Thursday, is a veteran screenwriter known for the big laugh. His 
scripts include "Blazing Saddles" and "The In-Laws" -- not bad credentials for 
a funny man, especially if you like it broad. 
</P>
<P>
And those who do probably won't be disappointed by "Social Security." It's 
loaded with gags, at least a handful a minute, most of them as subtle as a poke 
to the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
The jokes surrounding art world upper-crusters David and Barbara Kahn and their 
skirmishes with her sister, Trudy Heyman, and her dopey accountant husband, 
Martin, are pretty sitcomish, built more around silly situations than anything 
else. The primary situation is the arrival of Barbara's and Trudy's mother, who 
has been dumped on the Kahns when the Heymans find themselves in a family 
crisis involving their sexually adventuresome daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The Kahns (Kathleen Collins and Jerry Evans), own a trendy Manhattan gallery; 
the Heymans (Marcie Ross and Bruce T. Campbell) live on Long Island and don't 
know anything about art. They get on each other's nerves. They put each other 
down a lot. They crack wise. Then Mom (Pati Tambellini) comes along and oy vay! 
</P>
<P>
Mom comes on like Jaws but turns into quite a charmer when a famous artist 
starts courting her. Bergman, in a fairly graceless but sweet way, delivers a 
gentle comment on how love and magic can enter our lives even when everybody 
else thinks we're a step from the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the comedy isn't quite as sweet-spirited. "Social Security" can get 
a little feisty, as with its ongoing zinger at rich people who worship fine 
art, believing it to be emblematic of social standing. It's a good target -- 
all that pretentiousness and superficial thinking deserves a kick in the shins 
-- but it gets weary, old-hat, after a while. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd pleasers in director Beth Hansen's cast have to be Tambellini and 
Collins. Tambellini plays it fairly restrained, even when she's creating havoc 
for the Kahns, and she serves the role well. Her transition from dud to duchess 
is smooth; not funny, but easy to accept. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, on the other hand, is all effect and antics. Her Barbara is a nervous, 
neurotic New York mess -- the comedy comes from watching her get overwhelmed by 
every little thing. But there's not much character development. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who approaches David as the quintessence of glib, and Campbell, with his 
completely up-tight Martin, do their jobs as comic foils. In a small role as 
the old artist wooing Mom, David Paul brings in some class. 
</P>
<P>
The set is supposed to give us an idea of just how successful and important the 
Kahns are, but Gil Morales' creation is not convincing. The look is more 
medium-cost hodgepodge (would a wealthy couple use what look like clear plastic 
end tables?) than expensive chic. And the "beautiful" canvas of Mom, painted by 
her "genius" suitor and supposedly a telling symbol of her new life, is without 
style.

PHALLIC PHOTO CONTROVERSY BOOSTS ATTENDANCE IN CYPRESS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: RAFAEL SERRANO CALLED IT "CENSORSHIP" WHEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WAS PULLED 
FROM A FLYER, BUT WHEN WORD GOT AROUND, MORE PEOPLE THAN USUAL DROPPED IN AT

Nothing like a little controversy to get the public's attention. Attendance 
went up this week at the Cypress College Fine Arts Gallery after news broke 
that college officials had pulled a Rafael Serrano photograph from an exhibit 
flyer because of fears that its phallic symbolism would offend some people. 
</P>
<P>
A news story on the situation was published Wednesday; gallery director Robert 
Hardy said he saw about 30 visitors in the gallery on Thursday, a high number 
for what is normally a slow day. "I did notice that staff members from across 
the campus came by," Hardy said. "That never happens." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy added that it is "unfortunate" that it takes a controversy to increase 
gallery attendance. Robert Johnson, the Cypress College photo instructor who 
curated the exhibit, said he has noted no other fallout from the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano himself spoke at the college Thursday but mentioned the flyer 
controversy only in passing when he showed a slide of the disputed work, 
"Panorama/Day." He described the image as "quite beautiful, actually, and 
certainly not in bad taste, if you ask me." 
</P>
<P>
The work and others in Serrano's "Fertility of War" series remain on view at 
Cypress College through Nov. 16. Two other artists in the exhibit, Sheila 
Pinkel and Charlene Knowlton, also spoke Thursday before an audience of about 
70. 
</P>
<P>
"Panorama/Day" was pulled from the flyer, which was sent to the school's 
general mailing list, at the request of college President Kirk Avery. The blank 
space left on the flyer as a result of the last-minute decision was outlined in 
dashes with one sentence inside: "This work is unique, but may be considered 
offensive to some." 
</P>
<P>
Serrano, who is from Los Angeles, labeled the act censorship and an example of 
"American-style fundamentalism." (Serrano is no relation to Andres Serrano, 
whose "Piss Christ," a photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine, was a focus 
of recent congressional attempts to regulate the content of federally funded 
art.) 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Serrano said Thursday that he was trained as a painter and began working 
with photography about four years ago. He showed slides of a series called 
"Urban Caves," shots of graffiti-splattered pedestrian tunnels under freeways 
late at night. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes lit the scenes with fire, "creating a ritual as I photographed" 
and dramatizing a connection he perceives between the works and the Paleolithic 
cave paintings of France and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The "Urban Caves" series led to his "Fertility of War" photographs, in which he 
shot tiny model landscapes that combined the symbols of early cave paintings 
with images of modern weaponry and phallic symbolism, in what he calls an 
exploration of patriarchy and male aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to bring my caves home with me, so to speak," Serrano said. "To me, 
they're like movie sets -- miniature movie sets. . . . They fulfill my 
fantasies of being a film maker." He also said they made him "feel like an 
explorer, creating my own kind of archeological diggings." 
</P>
<P>
Since completing the widely shown "Fertility of War" series almost three years 
ago, Serrano said, he has returned to painting. He showed several slides of his 
recent work, which continues developing some of the themes in his photographs. 
It too is inspired in part by the ancient cave painters, and delves heavily 
into symbolic male and female imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibition of photography by Rafael Serrano, Charlene Knowlton and Sheila 
Pinkel continues through Nov. 16 in the Fine Arts Gallery at Cypress College, 
9200 Valley View St., Cypress. Hours: 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays through 
Fridays. Admission: free. Information: (714) 826-2220.

Sometimes the mountain does come to Mohammed. This week, it came to Fullerton 
and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Smithsonian Institution of Washington is presenting, through Sunday, a 
series of lectures, seminars and other events at various places in the two 
cities as part of a program designed to share its vast resources nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The institution houses about 135 million objects in 14 art, science and history 
museums and galleries. It launched the local series Thursday night with a slide 
show and lecture on a corner of the art world to which most are never made 
privy: the American artist's studio. 
</P>
<P>
"By looking into the artist's own world, we can see how he lived, how he 
worked, what inspired him," visiting lecturer William McNaught, New York 
Regional Director of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art, told about 60 
people at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
McNaught said the archives, which acquire and preserve documents and 
memorabilia, also contain hundreds of photographs that "tell us about the image 
artists wished to project," an image of themselves and their life style that -- 
like art itself -- has changed radically over the past 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Studios of the early 19th Century were modestly appointed, but as artists' 
gained prominence in the world, the idea of the "grand style of studio" was 
born, McNaught said. Artists' studios then began to reflect the change in 
social status and became "a major preoccupation" for many. 
</P>
<P>
"The consciousness of their surroundings had a lot to do with the increasing 
social standing it brought to be an artist in an increasingly richer, 
industrialized America," McNaught said. 
</P>
<P>
Paris, where American artists flocked to study with the masters, had the 
greatest influence on the new style of interior design. The "extraordinary" 
Parisian ateliers were furnished with "imported fabrics, porcelains, glasses 
from North Africa, carvings, strange and exotic furniture, potted palms, 
hanging Oriental carpets and countless objects of every sort," McNaught said, 
proving the point with several slides. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous American studio of the Parisian style was that of William 
Merritt Chase, whose ostentatious workplace McNaught showed in photographs that 
prompted his audience to gasp. 
</P>
<P>
"Determined to claim his rank as one of the nation's pre-eminent painters," 
Chase had a lavishly appointed place, as described by an art journal at the 
time, McNaught said, cluttered with huge Japanese umbrellas, a rich Venetian 
tapestry, armor and musical instruments all over the walls, a carved 
Renaissance chest, a Turkish coffeepot and myriad other items. 
</P>
<P>
Chase, who by the 1880s had set the standard for artists' studios, even gave 
out autographed photographs of his garish gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Portraitist John Singer Sargent, although he exhibited less extravagant taste, 
had an elegant high-ceilinged studio in Paris that "became the ideal for the 
successful artist," McNaught said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone adhered to these standards, however. Albert Pinkham Ryder, for 
instance, lived in a room known for its filth. Reading from another 
19th-Century periodical, McNaught said that Ryder's room was "cluttered with 
bags and barrels filled with paper, empty food boxes, old clothes, especially 
undergarments . . . and mice that had decayed in traps." 
</P>
<P>
With the turn of the century, a new generation of artists interested in greater 
simplicity rebelled against the precedent, paving the way for more change. 
</P>
<P>
Many artists before the war considered themselves "workmen," not members of the 
elite, and their sparse, utilitarian studios reflected this attitude, McNaught 
said. The large-scale works of modern art led to the popularity of the loft, 
the trend for huge, cavernous spaces launched in New York, McNaught said. 
</P>
<P>
"But perhaps it is in the field of sculpture that one can see the most dramatic 
changes in what constitutes the artist's working place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in technology in the 20th Century allowed artists to use new materials 
made of steel and other metals, thereby necessitating studios "equipped with 
welding torches and other machinery required to twist, bend and cut these 
industrial fabrics." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many factories -- which can also supply cranes and other tools needed 
to produce the large-scale works still in vogue -- now specialize in producing 
sculpture for artists, McNaught said. 
</P>
<P>
"The factory as studio is a far cry from Mr. Sargent or Mr. Chase," he said. 
But, he added, "in the end, it is the work of art, not the working environment, 
that matters and that lasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend events being presented by the Smithsonian Institution's Lecture and 
Seminar Program today include a seminar on "Photographing Nature: A Closer 
Look," 9 a.m. to noon, Ruby Gerontology Center, Mackey Auditorium, Cal State 
Fullerton, $20; a workshop for primary school teachers on "Planning a 
Mini-Museum: A Workshop for Teachers," 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Bowers Museum, 2002 
N. Main St., Santa Ana, $10; a concert, "Salute to American Popular Song and 
Jazz," 8 p.m., Wilshire Auditorium, Whiting Avenue at Lemon Street, Fullerton, 
$5. 
</P>
<P>

Museum, $4; a lecture on "Celebrating Photography's Early Years," 3 p.m., 
Visual Arts Center, Cal State Fullerton, Room 197, 800 N. State College Blvd.,

EMOTIONALLY CHARGED EVENTS FIRE 'FLASHBULB MEMORIES,' STUDIES FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK D. ROYLANCE, THE BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soon after the tremors settled down, survivors of the Oct. 17 San Francisco 
earthquake began filling the ears of friends, neighbors and reporters with 
vivid accounts of where they were, what they were doing and how they reacted 
when the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
One 73-year-old survivor recalled, "I was just sitting in my dinette, having a 
glass of wine and reading Good Housekeeping, getting really relaxed, when 
everything started coming down off the walls." 
</P>
<P>
They were the same kinds of stories that Americans old enough to remember still 
tell of where they were and what they were doing when they first learned of the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy's assassination or the explosion of 
the space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Such unexpected, emotionally charged events can trigger what some psychologists 
call "flashbulb memories" in the people who experience them. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon was first described more than a decade ago by Harvard 
researchers Roger Brown and James Culik, based on studies of people's memories 
of the Kennedy assassination a dozen years after the event. Their study 
suggested that events with powerful emotional content triggered a special kind 
of photographic memory process. 
</P>
<P>
But more recently, researchers like Michael McCloskey, professor of cognitive 
science at Johns Hopkins University, have argued that so-called flashbulb 
memories are no different from ordinary memory, only stronger, as might be 
expected for a major event. 
</P>
<P>
Fergus I.M. Craik, a memory researcher from the University of Toronto, said at 
the annual conference of the Association of Science-Technology Centers in 
Baltimore last week that some research has suggested that flashbulb memories 
tend to be most vivid in their context -- in the detail of the time and place 
of the individual's immediate surroundings and his emotions -- rather than in 
the details of the event itself. 
</P>
<P>
And that, he said, may suggest the phenomenon's evolutionary purpose -- its 
payoff in terms of human survival that has allowed it to become a part of our 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
The animal equivalent of flashbulb memories may mean the difference between 
life and death. 
</P>
<P>
An animal in the wild is more likely to survive, Craik said, if it is able to 
recognize the smell of the forest where an earlier attack by a predator took 
place, the ominous silence, the time of day, the season, the weather -- any 
details that might warn of danger if they are ever encountered again. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly affected, many earthquake survivors would be expected to find it 
difficult or impossible to go back into the house -- or the state -- that 
shook, just as air crash survivors may refuse to fly again. 
</P>
<P>
"Reinstating the context (of an emotionally traumatic event) may be very 
disturbing," Craik said. "I had a student who had been recently sexually 
assaulted. She told me that one of the very disturbing things for her was when 
she saw her car -- she had been assaulted in her car -- the next time, she 
didn't want to get back in the car." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the photographic quality their name implies, Craik said, flashbulb 
memories can be inaccurate. He recalled the case of a psychologist who appeared 
on an Australian television talk show with a local police chief to discuss the 
poor reliability of traumatized witnesses to violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the show, Craik said, the psychologist was arrested on suspicion 
of rape. The victim had been watching the TV talk show when she was attacked in 
her apartment and raped. 
</P>
<P>
In her distress, Craik said, "she had merged his face with that of her 
attacker" and provided police with a vivid description of the psychologist. The 
psychologist, of course, had an iron-clad alibi, and he was later released.

Rosa pauses in front of the bathroom mirror to study the results of her evening 
makeup ritual: Bangs, resembling peacock feathers, shoot stylishly three inches 
above her forehead; frosted lids highlight thickly lined eyes; cheeks have been 
brushed with a burning rouge hue. 
</P>
<P>
This meticulous beauty routine has made her late for the cross-town drive into 
her gang-member boyfriend's Santa Ana neighborhood. And that will make him 
angry. She is used to that, but shouts anyway at her best friend, Monique, to 
hurry up. 
</P>
<P>
"You know he hates to wait," says Rosa, 19, dabbing her dark burgundy lips with 
a piece of tissue. She checks a 12th and final time in the mirror then heads 
for the door. 
</P>
<P>
The two young women could be the girlfriends of any gang member in any 
predominantly Latino neighborhood of Orange County. Like their boyfriends -- 
who are easily identified by their khakis, T-shirts, gold chains and tattoos -- 
Rosa and Monique (not their real names) fit a mold. Their stylized hair and 
heavy makeup -- topping off a trendy wardrobe of cropped tops, miniskirts and 
high-top sneakers -- makes them easily identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
They are not typical Latinas. They have been unable to overcome the adverse 
social and economic forces that rule the barrio. They run with the wrong social 
clique, sometimes for years. Their language is rough, often laced with 
obscenities and gang slang. Their view of the world is focused on a narrow 
plane: Either you're cool or you're not worth hanging out with. 
</P>
<P>
They are also not gangsters, as gang members refer to themselves. None of the 
more than a dozen young women from central Orange County who were interviewed 
for this story claim gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
But they date gangsters, and that puts them in a category all their own. The 
county's approximately 9,000 gang members commit 35% of the felonies in Santa 
Ana and are responsible for 20% of the city's homicides. As such, the Latinas 
are marked by anti-gang investigators as gang sympathizers, a role many accept 
with a bravado matching their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The story of young women who date gang members may seem like any romantic 
teen-age adventure -- of partying all night and sleeping most of the day. But 
because a gangster's life is so consuming, his girlfriend can find the life 
style inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
It is an existence that is of growing concern to a group of professional Latino 
women in the Santa Ana area who are working to expose young Latinas to lives 
and professions that are different from the traditional roles of wife and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show girls," says Irene Martinez, president of the Mexican American 
Women National Assn., that "there are many alternatives in this life. . . . You 
don't have to (just) marry, and you don't have to have children." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez views Latinas who date gang members as strong and fiercely independent 
young women who have loyalty and leadership qualities. But, she says, they 
channel these energies into such outlets as gangs and boyfriends because they 
have not been introduced to alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 professional Latinas have volunteered as big sisters for MANA's 
Hermanitas project; hermanitas means little sister. They will be paired with 
younger women for friendship and exposure to different life choices. 
</P>
<P>
To provide an introduction to MANA and the project, the organization is holding 
a daylong orientation today at Saddleback High School in Santa Ana. Among the 
ideas for activities are trips to university campuses and outings to theaters, 
concerts and other cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole purpose as an organization is to promote the advancement of the 
Hispanic woman," Martinez says. "We want to expose (the young women) to as much 
as we can. There's so much talent and potential in these girls. There's a lot 
of bright girls out there who just need a little support and direction." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the cocaine-filled all-nighters with drug-dealing former 
boyfriends, Monique, at 22, has mellowed out. 
</P>
<P>
She still cruises. And she still drinks beer with the homeboys. But she hangs 
out with gangsters who are "down," those who are less active than younger 
members. She is looking to settle down herself. 
</P>
<P>
And like the veteranos of the gangs, she knows the way things go in gang 
neighborhoods and has advice for younger women. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing is, you don't talk, you don't pass messages," she says. "I 
know people from everywhere. I've gone out with guys from Delhi, Golden West, 
1st Street, 6th Street, 17th Street. They come up to you and they'll play 
tricks: 'So-and-so told me . . . is it true?' Because they know you know. I 
don't tell them anything." 
</P>
<P>
Such unspoken rules of being a gangster's girlfriend -- loyalty to the 
boyfriend, no passing information to rival gangs or police -- are simply known 
and abided. Most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Monique and Rosa disagree on how far that loyalty goes. 
</P>
<P>
Being the rebel and the romantic, Rosa is the one to break the rules to help 
out her boyfriend. She recalls the time her boyfriend's gang was "banged" -- 
attacked -- by rivals. He wanted to know which guy from the rival gang was 
responsible. Rosa knew. So she drove him down the street, right past the home 
of the rival gang member who was responsible for the shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
By Monique's standards, that was a crazy move. 
</P>
<P>
"I made him get down in the car, because if those guys saw him, they'd start 
shooting," Rosa says. "They don't care what they hit, they're just gonna start 
shooting at him." 
</P>
<P>
Most women who date gangsters do not see other men. But those who do say 
jealousy and possessiveness dictate that the gangsters never learn about the 
indiscretion. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa does it by never telling a boyfriend where she lives. Unusual in that she 
is mobile, with her own car, she dates gang members in different county cities. 
And she never lets any of them too close to her own life. 
</P>
<P>
"I always get their phone number. I always call them," she says. "You just 
gotta be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Seeming both proud and angry at the memory of a beating she once took from a 
jealous former boyfriend, Rosa remembers his warnings: "You better watch what 
you do, you better watch the gangs you see." 
</P>
<P>
"You get these guys who are jealous and possessive of you," she says. "When 
you're going out with them, you're theirs. That guy wouldn't let me out of his 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
She now laughs at his demands for her not to wear her trademark dark lipstick 
and not to dress in miniskirts, in fear that other guys would go after her. 
Still, when she goes out with her girlfriends now, her current boyfriend tells 
her: "You better check your rear-view mirror -- I'm watching you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their boyfriends' intense jealousy, the girls enjoy the attention a 
possessive boyfriend gives. They say they like being with someone who always 
wants them within eyesight. They are moved by the crazy, romantic passion of a 
gangster who would literally kill for his woman. 
</P>
<P>
They proudly exchange stories of jealous boyfriends and ones who slap them 
around, just as their gangsters tell tales of fighting a rival gang or fending 
off the police. 
</P>
<P>
But while they half-seriously, half-jokingly complain about their gangsters, 
most would not have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always something going on in a relationship like that. There's 
competition, and I like that," says Rosa, who can flash any local gang's sign. 
</P>
<P>
She unhesitatingly says that she will always date gangsters. "They show that 
they care about you a lot," she says. For her, life without a gangster 
"wouldn't be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
The young women who date gang members say they enjoy the married-to-the-gang 
life style. 
</P>
<P>
They say they like being at the hub of gang life. They like knowing what is 
going on in different gangs and being welcome at the houses where gang members 
congregate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always something going on, whether it's fighting or this or that," 
Rosa says. "And they always want you right there." 
</P>
<P>
Most say they would not feel safe in some neighborhoods if they were not 
hanging out with or dating a gangster. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything happens to us, they're right there with their guns," Rosa says. 
"They protect you." 
</P>
<P>
Diane, who is 15 but easily passes for 19, has been dating since she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays," she says, "the girls that are 12 look much older, and the girls 
that are 13 are all burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Most of them are looking for cocaine, and when they figure out which guy has 
it, they flirt with him until they get it. It's a two-way street, she says. 
Guys want information or sex, and girls want a line of coke. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up the party-sex scene, Monique says: "You have it all there (alcohol 
and different kinds of drugs), and he pays for everything. . . . These guys 
have been down the road and back, and if the girl is young, she'll just go for 
it. The guy is drunk and saying, 'Don't worry, I'll take care of you.' You find 
out later he's married." 
</P>
<P>
Diane says the only type of contraceptive she knows about are "those pills that 
some girls take." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the Latinas interviewed stare blankly when asked what type of 
contraceptives they use, and most laugh at the idea of their boyfriends using a 
condom. 
</P>
<P>
"Birth control? It's up to the girl," Monique says flatly. "Most girls want 
protection. Most guys don't care." 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the girls who date gang members do not use contraceptives and 
have no idea what safe sex is about, says Estela Martinez, director of 
education at Planned Parenthood in Santa Ana, which covers Orange and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Because they often ditch classes or simply never go to school, many of the 
women who date gangsters do not receive adequate sex education, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of Latino families have a problem with talking about sexuality 
openly," says Martinez, who operates a program through Planned Parenthood to 
help Latino families communicate about sexual issues. "In the family, it's 
still a taboo subject." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the young women say their pregnant friends tend to keep their babies. 
Because most Latinas come from Roman Catholic homes, they say abortion is rare. 
</P>
<P>
Also, most of the women do not have the money to pay for an abortion. And, they 
say, most of the men will not help. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in my day-to-day experience, I would say it's more likely that there are 
more women who carry through the term," Martinez says. 
</P>
<P>
Having a pregnant girlfriend has its benefits for a gangster. Fathering 
children by different women is something of a status symbol among some of the 
more irresponsible men. 
</P>
<P>
Diane says one F-Troop gang member she knows is notorious for the number of 
babies he has fathered: "That guy, I guess he thinks he's big because he's got 
a lot of girls pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
But more than status, the responsibility of a pregnant girlfriend or wife is a 
legitimate way for members to ease out of active gang participation. 
</P>
<P>
Colleene Hodges, supervisor of the gang-suppression unit for the county 
Probation Department, says a gangster can tell his homeboys that his girlfriend 
wants him at home more often. Or he can say he needs to spend more time with 
his children. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a respected way not to be active in the gang," she says. "He may be 
called upon at some point. But the members respect that. They leave him alone." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges adds that many gangsters see their girlfriend as the only person in 
their life who can help them. When they find a woman who plays a rescuer role, 
she says, they do what they can to keep her -- even if that means purposely 
getting her pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy latches onto her," Hodges says. "She's the only stable part of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the women who date gang members, marriage is the end goal. Many do 
not have high school diplomas and most do not work. 
</P>
<P>
Gangsters they hang out with -- whether a current boyfriend, a former boyfriend 
or just a gangster she is dating -- financially provide for them, although most 
of the women are too proud to admit to their dependence on boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Younger women say they save their lunch money to afford weekend nights out. But 
older ones do not think they can ask their parents for spending money, 
especially because many -- such as Monique and Rosa -- live in single-parent 
households where money is tight. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage offers the perfect transition into adulthood and the perfect solution 
to surviving in life. "The guys take good care of you," says Monique, who adds 
that her mother tells her to take her time and find herself a good man, one 
that will not beat her and who will provide for her. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a guy who isn't working, you want to leave that guy," Monique 
says. "I mean, where does it get you? Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to school, most of the women say they plan to finish high school 
and apply for college. Others are certain that they will soon return and take 
the remaining classes they need for high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'll go back," says Rosa, who is just a few courses shy of receiving a 
high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
She says she was recently in an auto accident and is taking time off from 
school and work. She talks of eventually going to college and taking business 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
But the County Department of Education says at least a third of all county 
Latinos never finish high school, and Martinez of Planned Parenthood says 25% 
of those Latino women drop out because of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Monique says she had been attending a local community college, but the 
inconvenience of not having a car and relying on buses finally wore down her 
academic enthusiasm. "It's hard," she says. "I tried it and stuff, but it just 
gets to you." 
</P>
<P>
Diane was looking for a job, but the appointment interview conflicted with a 
court date on a curfew violation, so she canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
Their high aspirations are not surprising, says Martinez of MANA: They are 
strong, intelligent and passionate young women, but they lack the skills and 
direction to fulfill their goals. And they lack alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
So, not knowing which way to turn, they turn to what they do know: how to be a 
good girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Monique mourns the sudden end to a relationship she wanted to last. She had 
given up seeing other gangsters to make a particular romance work. Still, it 
didn't. He left her for another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa comforts her friend. She says Monique will be fine: "She's such a pretty 
girl." They laugh a little together. Things will be all right. They always are. 
</P>
<P>
And their nocturnal schedule continues. So does the drinking, the parties, the 
dates, the games. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to lose her edge easily, Rosa laughs at her own romantic dreams. "I 
wanted to have a kid and be married by the time I was 19," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At not yet 20, she says with a smile: "I'm still trying. I haven't given up 
yet." 
</P>

Attendance at six county museums generally has trended upward during the last 
five years. The numbers below include all museum programs: exhibits, classes, 
workshops and tours. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers for Laguna Art Museum, Irvine Fine Arts Center and Discovery Museum 
of Orange County all represent fiscal years; the Newport Harbor Art Museum and 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center make their count by calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Museum of Orange County opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Museum Center was closed for renovation between September, 1985 
and March, 1988. Since its reopening, the count has spanned the year from 
March, 1988 to March, 1989. The 1989 figures represent the seven-month period 
from March, 1989 to October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum closed its main branch for renovation in October, 1984 
and the South Coast Plaza site opened to fill the gap. The numbers shown for 
1985 and 1986 represent attendance at the South Coast Plaza site only. The 
Laguna Beach main site reopened in September, 1986; beginning in fiscal year 
1987, the numbers reflect attendance at both museum sites.
