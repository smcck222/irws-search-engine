The Fabulous Baker Boys (Cinemax Sunday at 9 p.m., Monday at 3 a.m., Tuesday at 
10 p.m., Friday at 11 p.m.), Steve Kloves' clear-eyed look at the unpromising 
end of show biz, is as salty and sexy and unhousebroken a movie as you could 
hope to find -- and one of the most enjoyable American pictures in recent 
years. Jeff and Beau Bridges have the title roles as a stale piano-lounge act 
resuscitated by sultry new singer Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
Gorillas in the Mist (TMC Tuesday at 4:30 a.m.) This 1988 film has everything 
you could ask for in an adventure picture -- exotic locales, romance, danger 
and, finally, tragedy. The film illuminates an extraordinary and unprecedented 
communication between a human being and the world's largest primates. At its 
center is an absolutely stunning performance by Sigourney Weaver as the heroic 
and controversial primatologist Dian Fossey. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy (Channel 5 Friday at 2 a.m.) William Wellman's 1931 gangster 
classic made James Cagney a star. It contains one of the most famous screen 
moments of all -- when Cagney shoves a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Pierce (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.) Joan Crawford won a well-earned 
Oscar as a self-made businesswoman caught in a deadly competition with her 
daughter, Ann Blyth, over Zachary Scott.

In the Oct. 14-20 issue of TV Times, Shav Glick's description of Jackie 
Robinson as ". . . combative, rebellious, and provocative. . ." is totally 
uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>
At best that characterization closely follows many of the comments made by 
writers when Robinson first signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was chosen by Branch Rickey because he was an intense competitor and 
because his high school and college coaches knew that he could handle the 
humiliation that would be thrown his way by opposing athletes, spectators and 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
I knew Jackie as a teammate at John Muir Technical High School in Pasadena, as 
a member of the football and track teams of 1935-37, and as a member of the 
track team of 1938 at Pasadena Junior College. Robinson was a competitor all 
the way. Rebellious, provocative and combative he was not! As a leader and a 
competitor more often than not, he was the catalyst that kept the rest of the 
team loose and ready to play.

Paul Brickman's very funny 1983 Risky Business (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Tom Cruise, under the sway of seductive hooker Rebecca De Mornay, turning 
his handsome suburban Chicago home into a brothel while his parents are away. 
</P>
<P>
83 Hours 'Til Dawn (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie based on an actual 
incident, stars Peter Strauss as a crazed kidnaper and Robert Urich as the 
father of Strauss' victim (Samantha Mathis), whom he has buried alive. 
</P>
<P>
Three Men and a Baby (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a 1987 smash, is as likable, 
though frothier than the original, as the French picture upon which it is 
based. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson are three swinging New York 
bachelors who find a baby on their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie The Last Best Year of My Life (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) teams 
Mary Tyler Moore as a psychologist and Bernadette Peters as her reluctant 
patient, a self-reliant woman facing terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Splash (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), one of the big box-office winners of 1984, 
has Tom Hanks falling in love with mermaid Daryl Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 An Officer and a Gentleman (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a slick, 
entertaining, old-fashioned heart-tugger about a couple of naval aviation 
cadets (Richard Gere, David Keith) who become involved with two townies (Debra 
Winger, Lisa Blount) while attending the rigorous U.S. Officer Candidate School 
in Puget Sound. Louis Gossett Jr. won an Oscar for his portrayal of a 
super-tough drill instructor. 
</P>
<P>
On Thin Ice: The Tai Babilonia Story (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie 
about the world champion figure skater. Rachel Crawford stars. 
</P>
<P>
Dragnet (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a 1987 release, has fun with the old 
Jack Webb radio and TV series, with Dan Aykroyd cast as the supersquare nephew 
of Webb's Sgt. Joe Friday and Tom Hanks as his ironic foil, but it stumbles on 
the overdone centerpiece of its plot, a band of hedonistic zealots who indulge 
in virgin sacrifice and pagan ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Even more over the top is the 1986 Big Trouble in Little China (Channel 11 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a try at mock-Oriental movie magic that goes leaden about 
a third of the way through. Kurt Russell seems to be spoofing John Wayne as he 
gets caught up in subterranean Chinatown intrigue in search of his best 
friend's kidnapped fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
Running Scared (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) stars Billy Crystal and Gregory 
Hines as undercover Chicago cops dreaming of opening a bar in Key West but 
sidetracked by plenty of exploits in the Windy City. It's a stylish 1986 genre 
piece, enlivened by the stars' fine rapport. 
</P>
<P>
In Trading Places (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), that hilarious 1983 
variation on "The Prince and the Pauper," Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy decide 
to see if streetwise Eddie Murphy can run their Philadelphia commodities 
brokerage as well as insufferable WASP Dan Aykroyd has.

FRESH CORN, PEPPERS AND (FROZEN) BEANS MAKE A NEW VERSION OF INDIAN SUCCOTASH

<P>
I COULD NEVER quite figure out why I'd never found fresh lima beans. They'd 
show up from time to time in plastic bags in supermarket produce sections, 
already shelled and usually treated with preservatives, but beyond that, they 
were canned or frozen. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, I started seeing fresh lima beans at farm stands in the 
Camarillo-Oxnard area (where limas grow in profusion) and at the weekly farmers 
markets in Santa Monica and other communities. "How come the supermarkets never 
carry these things?" I asked a grower in Camarillo one day. "Too hard to 
shell," he answered. "People won't buy 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Limas do have flat, tough, dark green pods, but they aren't hard to shell at 
all -- easier than fava beans and no more difficult than peas. But are the 
fresh ones worth the trouble? Are they ultimately all that much better than the 
frozen variety? In my opinion, no. 
</P>
<P>
Lima beans survive the freezing process with a surprising amount of texture and 
flavor intact. Frozen limas do not need to be boiled or simmered in salted 
water for 15 to 25 minutes -- no matter what Birds Eye or Springfield or the 
Jolly Green Giant may tell you. They just need to be heated through. Most 
people don't like them because they're mushy. Take my word for it: They're not 
mushy unless they're overdone. 
</P>
<P>
The lima bean (Phaseolus limensis) takes its name from Lima, Peru, where it was 
widely grown, and was first mentioned in print in 1756. The "Larousse 
Gastronomique" adds that the lima is also called the Cape bean or pea, the 
Sieva bean, the sword bean, the jack bean and the Chad bean. Larousse does not, 
however, offer a recipe for the thing -- possibly because the French consider 
the lima poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
If Larousse had offered a lima-bean recipe, it almost certainly would have been 
for succotash -- a dish which, with the possible exception of ham hocks and 
lima beans, is probably the highest gastronomic use to which the lima can be 
put. Succotash is said to be an Americanized form of the Narragansett Indian 
word for an ear of corn, usually rendered as misickquatash. And whether or not 
the Indians actually ate succotash, it has certainly been a part of American 
traditional cooking for at least a couple of hundred years. 
</P>
<P>
I make a non-traditional version of succotash, with no butter and not very much 
cream but with the added flavorings of garlic, scallions and bacon. And I make 
it with frozen lima beans. 
</P>
<P>
NON-TRADITIONAL SUCCOTASH 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
3 1/4-inch slices slab bacon, cut into cubes 
</P>
<P>
6 scallions, trimmed and minced (use white and green parts) 
</P>
<P>
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 
</P>
<P>
1 stalk celery, cut into 1/4-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons mild paprika 
</P>
<P>
2 red or yellow bell peppers (or one of each) 
</P>
<P>
6 ears fresh white or yellow corn 
</P>
<P>
1 10-ounce package frozen baby lima beans 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup heavy cream 
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper 
</P>
<P>
In large skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-low heat; add bacon 
and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp. Remove with 
slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Add about 2/3 scallions, garlic, celery and paprika to oil and bacon fat, and 
saute slowly until vegetables are translucent. 
</P>
<P>
While vegetables are cooking, char peppers quickly on all sides on barbecue, in 
preheated broiler or directly on gas burner. Allow to cool, then scrape off 
charred skin, halve peppers and scrape out seeds, ribs and stem. Cut peppers 
into pieces about 1/2 inch square; add to skillet. 
</P>
<P>
Husk and rinse corn; cut kernels from cobs with sharp knife. Add to skillet, 
and cook for about 2 minutes. Add frozen limas and mix well, cooking until 
heated through but not mushy, about 5 to 8 minutes. Immediately stir in cream, 
and add salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, stir in remaining scallions. Makes 6 servings.

Q &amp; A / MACDONALD CAREY: THE MANY DAYS OF HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When NBC's "Days of Our Lives" began 25 years ago Thursday, Macdonald Carey was 
there playing Dr. Tom Horton, a role he still plays. 
</P>
<P>
Carey has received two Emmy Awards as outstanding actor in daytime series and 
received the Soap Opera Award twice as outstanding actor in a mature role. 
Besides Carey, two others remain from the original cast: Frances Reid, who 
plays Dr. Horton's wife, Alice, and John Clarke, who plays their son, Mickey. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Sioux City, Iowa, Carey began his acting career on the Broadway 
stage and has appeared in more than 50 motion pictures, including, "Shadow of a 
Doubt," "Dream Girl" and "The Streets of Lardeo." He also is an author and has 
published three volumes of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Carey talked about the days of his life with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Did you have any inkling the show would last this long? 
</P>
<P>
I always tell the classic story of Ken Corday (the producer) calling me and 
offering me the part on the show. Originally, the Hortons were the whole thing. 
It was just me and my family. He called and said, 'You may be stuck with this 
show for 10 years.' I said, "Oh, I don't care." I couldn't get a movie in those 
days. So I did it and look, here we are. 
</P>
<P>
I remember (Corday) was marvelous. He said, "I can't pay you for it, but I will 
also give you the announcing job too." Thank God he did because it kept me in 
there even when I wasn't in the plot line. 
</P>
<P>
Are you now on the series every day? 
</P>
<P>
They are always coming back to us. The show centers around the Horton family. 
But there are so many other love stories going on, you wouldn't know it 
sometimes. But they have to keep us in it a couple of days a week, that's in 
our contract. I just signed a new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Was the series live when it began 25 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
We were never live. We were a half hour. It was tough work because I was in 
every scene. I pushed every scene. I did more then than I do now when I have a 
storyline. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever have a really bizarre storyline? 
</P>
<P>
I can think of one that Frances had. She went off with Bo and Hope to New 
Orleans. They were looking for some spy. I had a story this year where I was a 
closet poet and I went in disguise and read my poetry in a sort of a beat 
place. It was nice because I had written all the poetry, but they finally 
resolved that. It was kind of fun, they called me Norm de Plum. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a lot of cast changes this year. 
</P>
<P>
You are hot for about five years. That's the limit of the run and then they put 
somebody else in. Susan Seaforth and Bill Hayes had one of the longest runs and 
she is back. Bo and Hope had a long run. Deidre Hall had long run. And then we 
were the first ones to involve a black family and that ran for quite a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Is it difficult to play the same character year after year? 
</P>
<P>
No, I'm an actor. Acting is acting. That's why there is no basic difference 
acting on a soap or a night-time drama. 
</P>
<P>
It's different with a Broadway show. I have had two hits on Broadway. I was in 
a show called "Lady in the Dark" with Gertrude Lawrence. I was the leading man 
in that. 
</P>
<P>
But then I had another show called "Anniversary Waltz," which I did with Kitty 
Carlisle. We ran for two years. It was me and Kitty and it got to be terrible. 
You feel as if a ball and chain were on you leg. You are doing the same thing, 
here (on "Days") at least you are doing something different. 
</P>
<P>
I have the best of two worlds. I am a writer. I wrote originally and I have 
time to write. I have three books of poetry published. 
</P>
<P>
Did you start writing in college? 
</P>
<P>
I started writing in high school. I wrote plays. The drama school was wonderful 
at the University of Iowa and I got sidetracked into directing and acting. 
</P>
<P>
I have my autobiography coming out in February. It's called what else? -- "The 
Days of My Life." I am very excited about it. 
</P>
<P>
Do you do poetry readings? 
</P>
<P>
I do as little of that as possible. Charles Bukowski likes my stuff. He wrote a 
nice introduction for my last book and he has been very kind to me. He said 
don't get caught up in that business. He said it throttles productivity and 
your juices as a writer. It's very bad. There are many writers along the way 
who have said as much. It's like a singer listening to the sound of his own 
voice. I do as little of that as possible and believe me, it's a great 
temptation. As an actor, I like to have an audience and people don't read my 
stuff the way I read it. 
</P>
<P>
You starred with Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright in Alfred Hitchcock's classic, 
"Shadow of a Doubt." Was that your first film? 
</P>
<P>
I had been doing starring roles for Paramount. I was about to go off to the 
Marine Corps and Paramount loaned me to Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hitchcock's favorite. Hitch was the dearest man. Contrary to what they 
say about him being hard on actors, he was so wonderful to you. I learned an 
awful lot from him, and other actors have said this. He said, "Don't act when 
you see this horrible thing, just drain your face of all emotions. Let the 
camera do it." 
</P>
<P>
He told Jimmy Stewart the same thing. Jimmy and I talked about it one night and 
Jimmy and I both agree he has got a bad name for the wrong reasons. Not that he 
should have a bad name at all. Hitch was a great family man and he took you 
into his family. Hitch was a very smart man, but he didn't let it get in the 
way of his humanity. 
</P>
<P>
"Days of Our Lives" airs Monday-Friday at noon on NBC.

TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT; 
</P>
<P>
HERE ARE THE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 14 QUESTION: WHICH SPORTSCASTER DO YOU 
WATCH, LOCALLY OR NATIONALLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I watch Keith Olbermann because I will see something I won't see 
anywhereelse-humor. That is, humor because his work is original, he has a 
clever play on words and sometimes he's just plain silly. 
</P>
<P>
More than this, he places events in historical perspective with a knowledge of 
tradition and obvious love of the games. 
</P>
<P>
He knows what really matters (i.e. the San Francisco earthquake; Jim Abbott's 
signing; the Donnie Moore tragedy) in personal as well as sports perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
And since, in all this, there is a recognition that the viewer might actually 
have some intelligence and awareness of sports and something beyond, I will 
continue to watch Keith Olbermann. 
</P>
<P>
Lulu Lewis, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Favorite sportscaster, local: Ed Arnold, KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
He is thorough, knowledgeable and straightforward, more interested in 
communicating sports news that his own notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
Tony T. Schaeffer, Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
Someone at KNBC should break the news to Fred Roggin that he has no sense of 
humor, and therefore should not try to tell jokes. Jim Hill is L.A.'s best 
sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur J. Lacher, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
My favorite sportscaster is Chris Berman on ESPN. He is articulate, fair and, 
most important, he can make us laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Eartha M. Porche, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
My answer is Todd Donoho of KABC. 
</P>
<P>
He's great on the news, his show "Monday Night Live" is great and he's also on 
radio (95.5-FM KLOS) every morning and he adds the right touch with his sense 
of humor. He knows sports backwards, forwards and sideways, and he genuinely 
seems to enjoy talking about all sports. 
</P>
<P>
Colette Barwick, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Who is my favorite sportscaster? No question-Jim Hill, KABC. 
</P>
<P>
He's knowledgeable, intelligent, articulate, no pizzas, no gimmicks or hype. 
Hegoes about his business of reporting and commenting, which conjures up two 
words: competent, professional. He's not afraid to take a stand and back it up. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Traxler, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
I don't listen to any of them. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a bonus for the sports announcer that gives all the results 
of the baseball games in the fastest time, and a second bonus to the cameraman 
who flashes the results in less than five seconds.

It is inconceivable that a major network would air a miniseries which combined 
poor writing, casting, acting, directing and even makeup all in one production. 
But NBC scored a first with "Jackie Collins Lucky / Chances. " (Oct. 7-9)

OLDEST HONG KONG EMIGRANT TO LEAVE FOR CANADA; 
</P>
<P>

OCCUPATION, SHE CAN'T FACE A TAKEOVER BY THE CHINESE.

Maria Venus Rozario has faced hunger and Japanese invaders during 100 years in 
Hong Kong. After her husband died when she was 33, she hacked a living for 
their eight children from this jungle of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rozario is leaving, lonely for the children already gone and fearful of 
China's Communist government, which takes over the British colony in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
When she steps onto the plane for Vancouver, Canada, the frail but spry 
great-grandmother will become the oldest emigrant in a mass exodus from Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
The government says 62,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people will leave this 
year, but other estimates put the number closer to 80,000. Most emigrants are 
professionals in their 30s and 40s, but growing numbers of old people are 
joining them. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's elderly, left behind by their emigrating children, often have the 
bitter choice of dying alone or leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too much to ask to be with one's family, is it?" Rozario said, 
fingering a tattered family photograph. "But I will also miss Hong Kong. My 
whole life is here with all my memories." 
</P>
<P>
Rozario, who plans to leave this month, has a daughter in British Columbia and 
a son in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Her home in Hong Kong is a small apartment in a run-down tenement in the 
teeming Kowloon section. 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs are the Steamy Steam Baths and the Chinese Happy Tattoo House. 
Upstairs, in Rozario's apartment, are fresh flowers and a small collection of 
butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Venus Gomes da Silva was born into a family of sailors from the 
Portuguese colony of Macao, 45 miles south of Hong Kong on the southern Chinese 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Her father moved to Hong Kong, where he married and started a family. Maria 
went to work at 14, teaching English grammar to the daughters of British 
soldiers stationed in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
She left the school in 1913 to marry a Portuguese businessman, and her first 
child was born in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
His death of a heart attack in 1923 left Rozario alone with eight children. She 
never remarried and supported the children by working two jobs at once, 
sometimes three, as secretary, clerk and accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know how hard hunger is to take, especially when it's your children 
who are hungry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Japan's brutal occupation during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Japanese troops lined up a group of young men on a boulevard by Hong 
Kong's harbor. A Japanese policeman moved along the rank, chopping off their 
heads with a sword. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rozario's sons, Marcos, was last in line. He had been arrested for 
resisting the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran through the crowd and pleaded with the man to save my boy," she said. 
"He gave in." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war, Rozario collected Marcos from jail. He was tortured and 
broken by the Japanese and still lives with his mother, unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
Rozario said she hopes to take Marcos to Canada, "but if we cannot get the 
visa, then he will stay here. This is what has become of my family." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, her other children left Hong Kong one by one, attracted by 
better job prospects or propelled by fear of the Communists in China. 
</P>
<P>
"The family all wanted to stay," she said, "but it was the insecurity about 
Hong Kong that made them leave. How can we live in peace here with the Chinese 
ready to grab us back?" 
</P>
<P>
Soon after China's bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing 
last year, Rozario also decided to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like in the Bible, it's really an exodus," she said. "I'm just a little 
drop of water in all this."

POLICE LOSING PATIENCE OVER ZURICH'S 'NEEDLE PARK'; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: PROPONENTS SAY EXPERIMENTAL DISTRIBUTION OF STERILE SYRINGES AND NEEDLES 
TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES IS WORKING. CRITICS SAY IT ENCOURAGES 
CONSUMPTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Late every afternoon, drug dealers and users throng around a converted public 
toilet in Platzspitzpark, an experimental open drug market by the scenic Limmat 
River. 
</P>
<P>
They cook up mixtures of heroin, cocaine and methadone, shooting them into 
arms, legs, ankles and necks. 
</P>
<P>
It is rush hour in "Needle Park," and some addicts are already slumped to the 
ground in a stupor. 
</P>
<P>
For drug users, Platzspitz, a narrow wooded peninsula jutting into the Limmat, 
is utopia. 
</P>
<P>
But police are starting to lose patience over the park. 
</P>
<P>
They say it is becoming increasingly dangerous and are threatening to withdraw 
their cooperation with a city policy that permits the open drug scene, provided 
it is small-scale. 
</P>
<P>
Platzspitz is also the scene of a city project to distribute sterile syringes 
and needles to combat the spread of AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
-- among drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"It is much better here since they started the service," said a swaying, 
21-year-old Yugoslav male prostitute who had just taken his daily cocaine 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Zurich Intervention Pilot Project (ZIPP), which distributes more 
than 8,000 syringes and needles a day, as well as about 200 condoms, say the 
park encourages drug consumption and attracts addicts from all over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of addicts mugging people by threatening them with possibly AIDS-infected 
needles are part of city lore. The tabloid newspaper Blick refers to the park 
as "Zurich's Drug Hell." 
</P>
<P>
Police have complained that the city policy means that they are powerless to 
maintain order in the park. In October, police representatives confronted the 
city government by calling a news conference and saying the policy should be 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the City Council disturbs us. We can't have a free hand down 
there," the head of the Police Officers' Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate is getting harder and harder down there," another police spokesman 
said. "The users and the dealers are getting tougher and officers have been 
attacked and threatened with needles." 
</P>
<P>
Police say they seize on average 2.2 pounds of heroin or cocaine a week at the 
park and are confiscating an increasing number of guns and knives. 
</P>
<P>
Those running the intervention program support the city government in saying 
the project is the only way to deal effectively with drug addiction and its 
inherent problem of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to live with the drug problem; nobody in the world has been able to 
eradicate it," said Peter Grob, a founder of ZIPP. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Robert Neukomm said, "The drug problem cannot be solved by 
tougher police measures, although we certainly need a police presence at 
Platzspitz. It's better to have the drug scene concentrated at Platzspitz where 
we can see it than hidden in the alleys of Zurich." 
</P>
<P>
Grob, under attack for promoting a permissive drug culture, answered: "What we 
do here is break the link between drug addiction and the transmission of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Through a window in the converted public toilet, doctors and medical students 
hand out one sterilized syringe and needle for every used one discarded into a 
large, blood-spattered vat. 
</P>
<P>
Sterile wipes, creams for damaged veins and, on request, fresh water are also 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to give them clean water than have them go to the Limmat River," said 
Regula Haeseli, a ZIPP nurse, as she turned to help a woman who burst into the 
room bleeding from a broken needle embedded in her arm. 
</P>
<P>
Grob said the project, which is funded by an annual $1.1-million grant from the 
city, the canton and the federal government, is the cheapest AIDS prevention 
program available. AIDS, which is transmitted through blood and other bodily 
fluids, strips the body of its defense against disease. 
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of August 12,198 people in 
Switzerland were AIDS carriers and 1,462 were suffering the full disease. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,000 to 2,500 people who visit Platzspitz every day, about one in four 
are "socially integrated" people with regular jobs, Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 are hard-core cases who virtually live at Platzspitz, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The addicts are not dangerous," Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
A party of schoolchildren walked by and stared at a junkie who collapsed. He 
began to shake uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
A ZIPP doctor came running, donned surgical gloves and revived him with oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens almost every day because of the cocktails they mix," Grob said. 
"Luckily we catch most of them before it's too late."

BRITISH LABOR PARTY STRUGGLES WITH IDENTITY: HAS IT LOST ITS WORKING-CLASS 
ROOTS? 
</P>

<P>
One question haunted the Labor Party's political metamorphosis here: Is it 
losing its socialist soul? 
</P>
<P>
The party of the working class has embraced moderation and modernity with a 
passion that is disturbing some old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
There is less talk of socialist struggle these days than of electoral 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
The red flag of revolution has been replaced as the party's emblem by the red 
rose of peaceful growth. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration of public ownership now takes second place to promotion of private 
industry. The welfare state cedes priority to investment. 
</P>
<P>
The trade unions that previously financed and controlled the party are being 
increasingly sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
The party of the underdog has disavowed its high-taxes-high-spending policies. 
It is now committed to living, as a government, strictly within its means 
whatever the social hardships. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders deny any retreat from the basic socialist goal of a fairer and 
more caring society. They argue that they are simply adapting to the times. 
</P>
<P>
But a new survey of 5,065 party members has reaffirmed a strong commitment 
within the ranks to traditional socialist values, feeding suggestions that the 
reforming leadership is not in tune with many members. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Roberts, a delegate attending his 45th annual Labor conference, said: 
"During those 45 years I have seen many attacks on the democracy of our party. 
. . . We must stand firm for our democratic rights to amend the policies and 
statements of our party. 
</P>
<P>
"The combined intelligence of the delegates to a Labor Party conference is 
greater than that represented on the (leadership) platform." 
</P>
<P>
Another delegate, Val Dunne, of the bakers' union, complained that middle-class 
and technical recruits to the party are increasingly dominating policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "These comrades . . . have this disproportionate influence, but above 
all they don't represent the working class and the poor people." 
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to devolve electoral tactics onto a small number of leading 
members, but quite another to devolve onto them responsibility for our 
political direction in the long term. That would be both unfair and, in the 
long term, a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Picking up the whiff of dissent, the political editor of the pro-Conservative 
Daily Mail, Gordon Greig, noted that there was "a gut feeling (among delegates) 
that it might be time to make a stand against a leadership whose star appears 
to be guided by the polls rather than principles." 
</P>
<P>
Even the pro-Labor Guardian noted that three largely symbolic votes against 
leadership plans on the conference's opening day "served as a reminder that the 
acceptance of (party leader Neil) Kinnock's reform package by many unions and 
activists still leaves Labor's heart in intermittent conflict with its head." 
</P>
<P>
If, in the midst of radical change, the Labor Party needs to be reminded of its 
deep working-class roots it could meet in no more fitting venue than Blackpool. 
</P>
<P>
This resort was built on the notion of "wake's week," when blue-collar 
industries would close for summer vacation and the workers would come here from 
the mines and mills of England's industrial northwest to clean their lungs and 
fill their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
Their pleasures were as simple as they were cheap: a walk along the pier, a 
ride on the carousels or a day on the beach when it was sunny; a gamble of 
pennies in the arcades or a sing-along in the pub when it was wet. Their diet 
was as basic as it was repetitive: fish and chips, or meat pie and mashed 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
They were from real cloth-cap-and-clogs backgrounds. They were the very stuff 
of the early blue-collar Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Today their grandchildren and great-grandchildren still come here in the tens 
of thousands from nearby industrial towns for the same simplest of pleasures.

The advisory council of the National Endowment for the Arts overwhelmingly 
approved grants for two controversial stage performers Friday, less than a week 
after Congress voted to repeal strict anti-obscenity curbs on the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment grants to two avant-garde New York theaters for performances by Karen 
Finley and Holly Hughes were approved by the National Council on the Arts on a 
voice vote, with 16 members voting yes and one abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
The presidentially appointed council's recommendation is only advisory. The 
final decision on the two grants rests with NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer. "I 
will make my decision as quickly as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous grant applications submitted by Finley and Hughes, along with 
performers John Fleck and Tim Miller of Los Angeles, were rejected by 
Frohnmayer in June on the ground that their work would not "enhance public 
understanding and appreciation of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
In September, the four performers sued Frohnmayer and the arts endowment in 
federal court in Los Angeles. They charged that their 1st Amendment free-speech 
rights had been violated because funds were denied on political rather than 
artistic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Frohnmayer was under pressure from conservative members of 
Congress to halt federal support for what they consider obscene and blasphemous 
artistic projects. Some critics have cited the NEA's previous grants to Finley 
and Hughes as evidence of a willingness to support objectionable works. 
</P>
<P>
Performance artists stage monologues and musical acts that frequently deal with 
feminism, racism, political issues and homosexual concerns, sometimes in 
sexually explicit terms. 
</P>
<P>
The two new grant applications are for performances by Finley at the Kitchen 
Theater and Hughes at the Downtown Art Company, both in New York. They had been 
unanimously approved by an NEA peer panel of outside artists and arts managers.

NASHVILLE BAR SERVES UP SUNDAY SERVICES

The preacher wears jeans and a Western shirt. The worshipers sit on bar stools. 
The offering plate is a cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Nashville Cowboy Church, which holds services in a hotel lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Yates, 47, the minister-founder of the church, says cowboys attended 
church services in saloons, so since late September he has been preaching every 
Sunday in the hotel lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been called a few names here and there about meeting in the bar and 
dressing the way we do," Yates said. "I seem to remember that Jesus was called 
a wine bibber. I think we're in good company. We're supposed to preach the 
gospel everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Yates' clerical garb for the nondenominational service is jeans, Western shirt, 
bolo tie and cowboy hat -- the collection plate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doctrinal, and I just preach a short message, 15 or 20 minutes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yates, ordained in the Independent Assemblies of God, doesn't rail against 
drinking and carousing and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't preach against things. We just preach the gospel of Jesus Christ." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of guitar players supply the music. 
</P>
<P>
When services are over, worshipers get $2 off the price of brunch at the hotel 
restaurant. "It's an incentive," Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance has averaged more than 30 even though the church is just getting 
started. Roughly half are tourists, many of whom spent the night before 
listening to cry-in-your-beer country music at the Grand Ole Opry three miles 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourists come to town and don't bring suits and ties," Yates said. "At our 
services, you can dress any way you like. We're trying to take away excuses for 
not going to church." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Darmos, a manager for a Nashville trash company, has been attending the 
church regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was skeptical at first, going to a saloon and being so casual. But you can 
relax, be yourself and worship. It puts you in the right frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go in a shirt and jeans and no one looks down his nose at me."

CLEAN POWER BLOWING IN DENMARK WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wind power is taking off in Denmark, already the world's second-biggest 
producer of wind energy after the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A major electricity company plans to build the world's first offshore 
wind-energy plant -- 11 turbines on rocks in the Baltic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Elkraft Power Co. said the plant will cost $5.8 million and, by 1991, could 
produce enough electricity to supply 4,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Clean power advocates like Torgny Moeller, publisher of a wind-power magazine, 
say wind could provide 20% of Denmark's electricity needs in the year 2000. 
That's double the government's goal for renewable energy use by that date. 
</P>
<P>
"Some communities in Jutland already are receiving up to 30% of their electric 
power from windmills," Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 turbines across the country provide only 1.5% of national 
electricity consumption. 
</P>
<P>
But the Danish Energy Ministry said power generated by wind turbines is 
competitive financially with power from oil and coal. And oil price increases, 
such as those triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, could make wind power 
more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The government began a $164-million turbine investment program 10 years ago. 
Since then, the cost of a kilowatt-hour of wind-generated electricity has 
fallen from 16 cents to 5.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of electricity produced from fossil fuels in Denmark is 5 cents per 
kilowatt-hour. 
</P>
<P>
In Ebeltoft, a string of 16 wind turbines built on a 2,600-foot pier generates 
enough electricity to satisfy needs of 600 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some call them windmills, but the old-fashioned word is too romantic for these 
three-bladed streamlined structures. The blades, like huge airplane propellers, 
swing in unison as the wind changes direction. 
</P>
<P>
From a small control room, supervisor Knud Nielsen uses a computer to monitor 
the turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen and one assistant maintain the machinery. "We've learned from 
experience that it's best to keep the design of windmills as mechanically 
simple as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities financed half the $3.4-million cost of the project in 1985. 
"One well-placed windmill park can pay for itself in five to six years," 
Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of energy that can be produced depends largely on the site. Turbines 
in built-up areas are least efficient. Wind blowing over open land provides 
power less efficiently than wind over open water. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark built three more seaside turbine parks after the success of the 
Ebeltoft project. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark will need a combination of clean-energy sources to wean itself from 
fossil fuels and from the nuclear-generated power it gets from Sweden through 
the Scandinavian grid, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best solution is a local mixed system, a hybrid of wind and solar energy. 
When there is no wind, the sun can still be shining," he said.

Major, a 1,200-pound polar bear, will lose his home this month. So will elderly 
orangutans Stanley and Betty, and a skinny Siberian tiger named Sasha. The 
85-year-old Stone Zoo is closing because of state budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't help (but) develop attachments to the animals," said Mark Goldstein, 
the zoo's director. "You think of them as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The zoo in this Boston suburb was already running on a shoestring when its 
budget was slashed 30% because of the state's financial problems. Officials 
decided to close the zoo Nov. 12 rather than keep the animals in shoddy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things worse than no zoo, like a bad zoo," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
About half the 200 or so animals will go to Franklin Park Zoo, the larger of 
the two facilities run by MetroParks Zoos. Others will be taken in by 
menageries around the country. 
</P>
<P>
But some are just too old or too big for easy relocation. 
</P>
<P>
"For some, it will take months to find them a good home," Goldstein said, "but 
we won't let them end up in private collections and we hope none will have to 
be euthanized." 
</P>
<P>
Large carnivores are expensive to feed and maintain, said John Linehan, curator 
of mammals for the MetroParks Zoos. Major, for example, eats about 14 pounds of 
meat and biscuits daily -- when he's on a diet. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha has an enzyme problem that keeps her a little skinny. And, though lions 
and tigers are increasingly scarce in the wild, they are fairly abundant in 
U.S. zoos. 
</P>
<P>
Orangutans Stanley, 31, and Betty, 30, resemble sad-eyed, red-haired Buddhas as 
they sit quietly in their separate glass enclosures. But they are more 
mischievous than tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty steals tools and you have to trade them back," Linehan said. "She gets a 
brush and starts scrubbing the walls, like we do. She won't go through doors 
she wants you to go through. She demands a lot of attention." 
</P>
<P>
The two orangutans have been together 20 years and produced four offspring, but 
they'll probably be separated when the zoo closes. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley may go back to Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, his first home. Betty's 
future is less clear, since she is old, fat and has an abdominal cyst that has 
left her unable to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think their separation will leave either ape heartbroken, keepers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty steals Stanley's toys," Linehan said. "Stanley is nice, except when he 
wants to have his way with Betty. They won't miss each other." 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he ends up, Stanley will be "happy to have females around," said 
Linehan. "He's pretty feisty for his age." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein hopes that Stone Zoo can be reopened someday. A bill in the 
Legislature would take the zoo out of state control and make it a public, 
nonprofit corporation similar to most other successful zoos nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the outlook isn't bright for the zoo's animals or its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Thelma Dennis, 69, has been a volunteer zoo tour guide for children for the 
past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm awfully sad," she said. "This is the real thing, or next to the 
real thing. Kids can't get the same feeling for an animal on TV that they can 
seeing them here." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get kids off the streets and we're taking away the zoos, the 
museums," said Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be 75 years old and want to take a 3-year-old out for the day," he 
added. "I challenge you to find something else you'd both enjoy."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peace is proving an elusive commodity in Mozambique, where a population of 15 
million is teetering on the edge of famine. 
</P>
<P>
"Every issue you discuss always comes back to the same point -- the need for 
peace," said a senior European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation 
policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the 
Mozambique government. 
</P>
<P>
"The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same 
people destabilizing Mozambique," the European diplomat said. "If you believe 
the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will 
come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned 
that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the 
population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United 
Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years 
beginning with 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area 
of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or 
early next year and we have no resources to fall back on," Simkin said in an 
interview. "We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive 
relief campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the 
Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and "donor 
weariness." 
</P>
<P>
Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September 
that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in 
Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever 
multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked 
about peace by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened 
optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all 
Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market 
economy, political pluralism and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
"You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining 
power," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from 
Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for 
further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to 
protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian 
Ocean port of Beira. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe 
troops," President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York 
recently. "All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops 
should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow 
if possible." 
</P>
<P>
Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white 
minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing 
force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas 
from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used 
primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against 
Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white 
security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it 
against Maputo. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and 
good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut 
all official links with Renamo. 
</P>
<P>
Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off 
from weapons and communications supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including 
Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique, 
continued to support the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
They believe other support came from groups within Portugal -- Renamo's 
official headquarters are in Lisbon -- and also Britain, West Germany and the 
United States.

BELLEVUE: ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF WAR-ZONE MEDICINE, IN MIDDLE OF A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Robert Hessler surveys the gridlock of gurneys cramming the emergency room 
hallways and makes a troubling diagnosis: Something is wrong beyond the chest 
pains, broken limbs and stomachaches confronting him. 
</P>
<P>
Each patient has a crisis, and has hurried here only to wait. The emergency 
room is an overstretched strand in the health care safety net, backlogged to 
the bursting point by overcrowding and social wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room is overwhelmed with patients who need to be administered 
to," says Hessler, assistant director of emergency services at city-owned 
Bellevue Hospital. "We do what we can minute to minute. We're using every 
little nook and cranny we can find to take care of these people." 
</P>
<P>
Five patients are going to intensive care; four more to the heart attack unit. 
Twenty-one have been patched up and are awaiting admission to the hospital, 
including one man with an oxygen tube in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
But the traffic doesn't stop with this batch of casualties. A cluster of 
arriving emergencies queues up for triage. The worst get seen first. 
</P>
<P>
Time passes with neither comfort nor silence in this makeshift ward. Patients 
on stretchers stare at the ceiling without so much as a curtain for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Hessler, 38, patrols the area with a stethoscope dangling from his neck and the 
pocket of his unbuttoned lab coat bulging with diagnoses on a note pad. Delays 
are more than just an inconvenience; they imperil the delivery of care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pleasant way to be sick," Hessler said. "I'm always afraid that 
somebody who's seriously ill has to wait longer than they have to for a 
physician." 
</P>
<P>
An average of 300 people a day pass through the emergency room at Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other dignitaries 
would be rushed here if something happened while they were in New York. Because 
of its quality care, city cops hurt in the line of duty prefer 264-year-old 
Bellevue, the nation's oldest continuously operating public hospital. 
</P>
<P>
It also sees the worst wounds of the city: crack addicts, bullet holes from 
drug-related assault guns, AIDS patients, the homeless who have no place else 
to go for care, teen-agers who need severed limbs reattached after being run 
over by subway cars, inmates from city prisons whose manacled ankles protrude 
from stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
At Bellevue, battlefield images fit like bandages on a wound. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of a field hospital. This is war-zone medicine. We see all the 
casualties," Hessler said. "We see everything here. We are the window to the 
world. You will never go anywhere else in the world and see something we 
haven't already seen at Bellevue." 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are found in two out of three patients who are shot, stabbed or hit by a 
car, doctors say. One-fourth of the trauma cases involve people who have mixed 
two or more intoxicants, usually alcohol and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless seek treatment for such ills as frostbite and rotted feet similar 
to soldiers who suffered trench foot, a disease caused by prolonged exposure to 
wet, cold and inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Third World situation," Hessler said. "And when it's cold, we see 
body temperatures of 66 degrees. That's almost the equivalent of hibernation. 
Their whole body is cold, not just their feet and hands." 
</P>
<P>
The river of patients creates stress and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"A patient doesn't have things people come to expect in a hospital -- a bed, a 
room, certainly not a TV. If you have to go to the bathroom, you get a bedpan," 
Hessler said. 
</P>
<P>
The clamor is a long way from the quiet calm of Hessler's hometown of Billings, 
Mont. He spent seven years at the University of Miami Medical School before 
doing his residency at New York University, one of the country's top medical 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hessler specialized in internal medicine, but opted for emergency doctoring. It 
allows him to do a little bit of everything that interests him: internal 
medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work with critically ill patients. They make you think and work the 
hardest you possibly can. You're keeping people alive," Hessler said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do the right thing in the first few hours for whatever they have. 
It puts such a stress on some people that one of the major problems is 
physician burnout. Some doctors aren't able to function with that pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Or the daily dose of death. For every rush of adrenaline that comes with saving 
a life, there are terrible pendulum swings of seeing people die. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not God. Not everybody can be saved," Hessler said. "But if you die in 
spite of everything I could possibly have done, at least I feel we delivered 
the best possible care and did everything we could have." 
</P>
<P>
He stays, even though there are better-paying jobs with less heartache. 
</P>
<P>
"People asked me why anybody from the NYU training program would want to do 
emergency medicine," Hessler said. "We're a setting of last resort, delivering 
care to people who don't have any insurance, don't have any money and don't 
have any place else to go. We're here because we want to help people." 
</P>
<P>
On call 24 hours a day, Hessler escapes the bedlam of Bellevue at his suburban 
home in River Vale, N.J. He eases the tension by clipping his rhododendrons, 
junipers and yews. 
</P>
<P>
"After a day of wild and chaotic work, I can go home," Hessler said. "I can 
trim the bushes, look at my lawn, water the plants, watch the birds flying 
around. I'm used to a more calm lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sewing up accident victims or treating kids who swallow rat 
poison, doctors care for societal ills. A Polaroid camera is kept to document 
suspected child abuse. A standard evidence kit can store specimens from rape 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
In one sweep through the room, Hessler bandages a smashed nose, takes vital 
signs on a heart patient, scalpels the bureaucratic red tape so a patient can 
get X-rays and tries to find out why a patient is waiting for attention. 
</P>
<P>
"You're doing three, four or five things at the same time," Hessler said. 
"You're working so hard you don't have time to think about what you'd rather be 
doing. You're too busy patching people's lives back together." 
</P>
<P>
Splotches of dried blood, bandage wrappings, discarded surgical gloves, 
bedpans, surgical tape, syringe cases and other medical flotsam litter the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Patients stack their shoes, coats and other possessions on the bottom of their 
gurneys as they wait to be released or admitted. Their medicine is not 
sugarcoated. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come to the emergency room, I can't give you peace and quiet and 
comfort," Hessler said. "And for people who aren't critically ill, I can 
guarantee you a very long wait."

NEBRASKA'S MYSTERIOUS SAND DUNES A HOME WHERE CATTLE ROAM; 
</P>
<P>
GEOLOGY: THE SANDHILLS MAKE UP ONE-FOURTH OF THE STATE. BUNCH GRASS KEEPS THE 
REGION FROM BLOWING AWAY AND FEEDS LARGE HERDS OF VALUABLE LIVESTOCK.

<TEXT>
<P>
The radio goes silent as stations drop out of range. 
</P>
<P>
Ghostly sand dunes with cliffs that look like the jagged end of a broken bone 
whip by the car's windows. 
</P>
<P>
Grit gets in the mouth, the hair, the eyes. Only bunch grass holds the sand 
down. There are only a few short evergreens, rolling hills, cattle, telephone 
wires and highway. 
</P>
<P>
One-quarter of Nebraska, about 19,000 square miles, is made up of this 
mysterious sand, once thought uninhabitable, now a major source of the state's 
cattle revenue. 
</P>
<P>
It's the largest sand dune area in the Western Hemisphere and one of the 
world's largest grass-stabilized dune regions. 
</P>
<P>
The Nebraska Sandhills stretch from South Dakota to North Platte and from 
Alliance in the Panhandle to Neligh in the east-central part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
There are oases. Small lakes burst out of the Ogallala aquifer, a stretch of 
underground water that spreads from South Dakota and Wyoming into New Mexico 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Niobrara, Snake, Loup and Dismal rivers cut through the land. At the edge 
of the Sandhills, the state's largest reservoir -- Lake McConaughy -- sparkles 
in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Stories abound about the sand's origins. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard everything from they were formed out of a giant lake . . . to they 
were deposited out of glaciers, out of the Ice Age," said Jim Swinehart, 
research geologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that the dunes formed out of windblown deposits from 
rivers that moved across Nebraska and then dried up 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Precipitation increased and grass stabilized the dunes until about 3,500 years 
ago, when they dried up once again. About 1,500 years ago precipitation 
increased and the dunes stabilized again, with minor periods of drought, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern that any warming of the Earth, such as from a heightened 
greenhouse effect, could return central Nebraska to a desert with moving sand 
dunes, Swinehart said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some say that in less than 50 years, we might return to dry conditions," 
Swinehart said. "Pretty soon, dunes would be over the roads, blocking the 
rivers." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Geological Survey crews are studying areas of the Great Plains, including 
the Sandhills, that are susceptible to wind erosion. Mapping and soil sampling 
should help scientists determine how dry it has to get before vegetation begins 
to die, geologist Chris Schenk said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, there is just enough precipitation in the Sandhills -- 23 inches a 
year in the east to 17 inches a year in the west -- to keep more than 498,000 
head of cattle fed. 
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled for Jan. 1 showed 1.7 million beef cows in Nebraska, fourth in 
the country behind Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma, said Jack Aschwege, a 
statistician with the Nebraska Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
Cash receipts for cattle and calves in Nebraska in 1988 totaled $4.4 billion -- 
55% of the state receipts for agriculture, Aschwege said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandhills have been over time renowned for its good cattle grazing 
capabilities," said Dennis Findley of the Texas Agricultural Statistics 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real cowboy country, there's no question about that," said Charles 
Flowerday, co-editor of the book "The Atlas of the Sandhills." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of place where you see certain hallmarks of the late 19th 
Century," Flowerday said. "Rounding up cattle on horseback, separating out 
calves and branding them. 
</P>
<P>
"But alongside these are harbingers of the 21st Century: satellite dishes, 
personal computers to manage ranches, electronic marketing." 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers are largely responsible for keeping the land alive, Flowerday and 
others said. Measures such as controlling prairie fires and avoiding 
overgrazing have even improved the land, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good ranching country -- but you have to treat it with respect or the 
sand will start to roll," said Chet Paxton, an 81-year-old rancher who lives in 
Thedford in the heart of the Sandhills. 
</P>
<P>
Paxton's parents moved to the area when he was 2 and soon learned farming 
wouldn't work. The Paxtons now own 1,500 head of cattle on 25,000 acres of 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rough," Paxton said of the early days. "Mother was used to Missouri and 
a lot of timber. She felt real bad about the barren land." 
</P>
<P>
But Paxton and others persevered. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandhills weren't always known as good ranch country. Early ranchers and 
farmers approached the forbidding edge and ventured no farther.

Larai married at 11 and almost died in childbirth at the age of 13 when she 
collapsed with a ruptured womb after two days in labor. 
</P>
<P>
She lost her baby and joined thousands of young Nigerian women made outcasts in 
their teens each year -- crippled and incontinent because of poverty, tradition 
and a lack of basic medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"When we began our work in 1985, we found 300 girls like Larai roaming the 
hospital waiting for an operation performed only 10 times a year," said Amina 
Sambo, coordinator of the Vesico Vaginal Fistula (VVF) program for the National 
Council of Women's Societies. 
</P>
<P>
She is based in Kano in predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria, where the 
frequency of pregnancy among girls not physically ready for it increases the 
incidence of VVF -- tearing of the uterus into the bladder or bowels because of 
obstructed labor. 
</P>
<P>
Victims either die or go through life with urine, feces or both leaking 
uncontrollably into the vagina. 
</P>
<P>
They are frequently sent packing by their polygamous husbands. Many turn to 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Sambo led a fund-raising campaign to build an operating theater in Kano that 
now patches up 24 VVF sufferers a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We must call on our men . . . to refuse to put immature girls in the family 
way. It may be the first and last time they will ever become pregnant," Health 
Minister Olikoye Ransome-Kuti told a conference on safe motherhood in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
An internationally recognized advocate of cost-effective, basic health 
services, he has pressured the military-led federal government to promote birth 
control and improve care for mothers and children.

Progress is painfully slow, for cultural as well as financial reasons, Sambo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We concentrate on raising awareness -- explaining the dangers of child 
pregnancy, that pregnant women of whatever age need medical care and that girls 
should stay at school until they are old enough to marry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Motherhood carries 400 times as much risk in Nigeria as in Europe or North 
America, said experts at the conference in Abuja, the country's planned future 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Nigeria accounts for a tenth -- 75,000 a year -- of all world deaths from 
motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Every few minutes a Nigerian woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth from 
bleeding, infection, obstruction, rupture, hypertension or abortion 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
Most would not die if they had the knowledge, the social status and the 
financial means to avoid getting pregnant too young, too old and too often, and 
to benefit from the advice and care of trained medical staffs. 
</P>
<P>
But few do, certainly not the 70% or more who live in rural areas far from the 
towns where this vast country's few doctors, nurses and midwives cluster. 
</P>
<P>
Clara Ejimbi, a community physician in northern Kaduna state, said she covers 
35,000 people without the help of a single gynecologist. There is not even an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of deliveries are handled at home by TBAs -- traditional 
birth attendants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
These are usually older women in the community, illiterate and without any 
formal medical training, but well able to help a healthy mother with a normal 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
It is when complications arise -- as they often do with undernourished and 
overworked mothers living without such basic amenities as sanitation and safe 
water -- that things can go badly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Thomas, one of Nigeria's first woman doctors and a veteran campaigner for 
safe motherhood, is working to educate TBAs against traditional practices that 
endanger women from different ethnic and religious groups all over Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Ritual genital mutilation -- so-called female circumcision -- leaves scars that 
obstruct childbirth. Taboos on certain foods may deprive pregnant women of a 
healthy diet. 
</P>
<P>
Women continue working during pregnancy, and signs of danger are accepted as 
normal, or as omens of another kind -- swollen feet as a sign of twins, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
If labor drags on -- five days is not uncommon -- the family is more likely to 
consult an oracle than a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Or the local barber may be called to make cuts, slashing at the vagina or 
cervix with an unsterilized blade, often damaging the child as well as the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"No scientific reasons are provided to substantiate these practices, the pain, 
trauma . . . disability and even death of the victims notwithstanding," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Women have little say in determining their own fate, having to defer to 
fathers, husbands and traditional chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if people accept that they need trained medical help, the cost of 
transport, drugs and the treatment itself may be more than the family can bear. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey Harrison, a pioneering gynecologist whose work in the northern city of 
Zaria first raised the alarm in 1985, says motherhood is becoming more 
hazardous as debt-burdened Nigeria and 100 million people sink deeper into 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Resort to traditional forms of care . . . with all its attendant risks is 
gaining ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People said that things would have to change after our Zaria study, and they 
have -- for the worse."

CALIFORNIA DOES PROTECT INSURANCE POLICYHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's column, "Insurance Won't Suffer S&amp;L-Like Collapse" (Oct. 
17), put the difficulties of the insurance companies into more realistic 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
However, Flanigan indicated that California does not have a guarantee system, a 
system in which all companies chip in to rescue the policyholders of an ailing 
member. 
</P>
<P>
California does have such a system now. One measure established a state 
guarantee fund to pay consumer claims filed against health insurance firms that 
go bankrupt, and a separate bill covers life insurance claims. The bills became 
law in September.

PRIVATE 'FEEWAYS' AN ANSWER TO FULL FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. POOLE JR., ROBERT W. POOLE JR. is president of the Santa 
Monica-based Reason Foundation and author of a 1988 study which inspired 
California's private toll road program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic congestion, smog and inadequate public funding for roads have all 
reached crisis proportions in California. In September, Gov. George Deukmejian 
approved plans that promise, for the first time, to address all three of these 
concerns. The new solution: private toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
Freeways are a California trademark. For years, travelers in the state have 
prided themselves on their ability to get to and fro freely. This free feeling, 
however, has contributed to what can safely be termed one of the world's 
greatest traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Road space and public funds to provide and maintain the roads are both limited, 
yet urban growth continues at unprecedented rates -- and experts say 
California's population growth will continue to be far above the national 
average. One solution would be to put a lid on growth. Another solution is to 
allow the private sector to participate in the management of growth, to the 
extent that it can. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision to allow four private toll roads to be developed is one 
method of getting the private sector to assist in coping with growth. And this 
idea seems to be catching on here in Los Angeles: Mayor Tom Bradley recently 
announced a plan to seek private-sector involvement to resolve the city's unmet 
transportation needs -- needs that were not addressed by the governor's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The four privately financed, developed and managed toll roads will include 
brand new roadways in San Diego County and in the San Francisco East Bay, toll 
lanes on the Riverside Freeway and a tolled extension of the Orange Freeway in 
Orange County. Most of these roads have a scheduled completion date of 1995-96, 
but the additions to the Riverside Freeway should be completed by 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
Private toll roads can do a great deal for the public. They promise freer 
flowing traffic (meaning less drive time to and from work) and less smog 
because moving vehicles produce less pollution than idling vehicles. Moreover, 
the fact that a private company builds and operates the roads and gets 
private-sector financing means that scarce public tax dollars will not be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
California's 1989 private tollways law (AB 680) provides for a 
Caltrans-sponsored process whereby the private companies were to assess and 
identify areas where the need for improved transportation is greatest. Having 
completed this process, the companies developed plans for building, financing, 
maintaining and operating their proposed projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, some policy makers were skeptical that private industry would be 
interested in providing roadways. To their surprise, 13 consortia answered 
Caltrans' plea for help. 
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in these projects include Perot Group, First Boston Corp., 
Fluor Daniel, Prudential-Bache Securities, CRSS Inc., Citicorp and Parsons 
Municipal Services. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, these "feeways" will not replace existing freeways. Rather, the 
four private toll roads represent a $2.5-billion net addition to the state's 
transportation system -- without having to raise a cent in taxes. They will be 
completely new developments. And no one will have to pay anything for these 
roads unless they deem it worth using them and paying the toll. It's not hard 
to see why this kind of deal is attractive to elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Tolls will be collected to repay the upfront lenders and to bring revenue to 
the operators. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the new roads and financial benefits are not the only gains involved. All 
four of the private toll roads will be equipped with modern technology that 
will allow for freer flowing traffic despite having to collect tolls. The days 
of stop-and-go tollbooths and the resulting lines are behind us. 
</P>
<P>
These toll roads will be equipped with electronic monitoring devices that allow 
vehicles to travel at normal speeds without having to go through tollbooths. 
This technology, referred to as automatic vehicle identification, or AVI, is 
similar to the use of a credit card. The motorist signs up with the toll 
company and receives a toll card that is placed on the car. Each time the car 
travels past a toll point, the motorist's account is debited. All four of the 
approved private toll road developers plan to employ this technology. 
</P>
<P>
In addition though, this technology makes it easy to charge higher tolls at 
rush hours and low tolls at other times -- a benefit far more important than 
just providing a means for collecting fees. Two of the private toll roads plan 
to vary their tolls according to demand. This system, referred to as 
"congestion pricing," promises to affect traffic flow like never before. 
</P>
<P>
This congestion-pricing technique has long been used by the telephone 
companies. Telephone companies price calls made during business hours higher 
than others to free up lines. These private toll road operators can use this 
pricing system to free lanes from congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the price differences, some people will negotiate altered work hours 
with their employers, while others will refrain from taking unnecessary trips 
during peak traffic periods. Others will take car pooling more seriously, while 
still others will choose public transportation. In other words, people will 
begin to assess their transportation needs more appropriately, cutting out 
unnecessary trips -- resulting in less traffic and less air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The current system, which does not permit management of traffic behavior 
through the use of market signals, is antiquated. The private tollway program 
is introducing this pricing concept in a controlled form. If it works on the 
new private tollways, we will all learn a valuable lesson in traffic 
management. If we can make two of our roads flow smoothly at rush hour, why 
can't we extend the idea to others? 
</P>
<P>
In short, what Caltrans, the governor and the private sector are doing is 
writing a bold new chapter in California's transportation history. We are -- 
let's face it -- experimenting with a radically different way, not just of 
financing and building highways but of managing them once they are in place. 
</P>
<P>
The Iron Law of Freeway Congestion -- that demand expands to fill every inch of 
freeway and bring traffic to a standstill -- has until now seemed immutable. 
California is setting out to prove that it ain't necessarily so.

TINKERING WITH TAXES WON'T BOLSTER ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's column, "Washington Fiddles, Productivity Burns" (Oct. 19), 
hit it on the nose. The pie (economic growth) is simply not big enough. 
</P>
<P>
How can we increase the size of the pie? As Flanigan pointed out, not just by 
tinkering with taxes. 
</P>
<P>
To increase productivity, an economy needs three things: increased investment 
in plant equipment, increased investment in the infrastructure and an educated 
work force that can cope in the modern workplace. 
</P>
<P>
To stimulate increased investment in plants, the government must use the 
carrot-and-stick approach. This means at some level taxing consumption while 
rewarding savings. 
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure is the responsibility of the government. More money must be 
spent on bringing our roads, bridges, and water and sewage treatment facilities 
into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult problem, however, is improving our education system. 
</P>
<P>
When a large segment of the adult population is functionally illiterate and 
lacking basic math skills, how are they going to be able to operate the 
increasingly complex machinery that is necessary to increase our productivity. 
</P>
<P>
More money is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of education must be sold to the average person. Public policy 
should encourage a change in our heroes, from athletes and rock stars to 
individuals who excel intellectually.

STORY ON KEATING'S STAY IN COUNTY JAIL ILLUMINATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The things you wouldn't know if you didn't read the Business section ("Keating 
Got Star Treatment During Stay in County Jail," Oct. 20). 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't know that Charlie Keating's stay in the Los Angeles County Jail 
was downright luxurious, compared to the accommodations offered lesser mortals, 
despite his wife's tearful letter to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
I guess it all depends on what you're used to. As I remember, my last meal long 
ago in the same jail was scrambled powdered eggs, if that is not a redundancy. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, I would not trade places with Charlie. I was released 
outright, eventually, after signing away my right to sue for false arrest. 
</P>
<P>
My more militant friends were somewhat disappointed in me, but I was very tired 
and very hungry. Caught a miserable cold, too. Ah, well, we are not all members 
of "corporate America."

ENLIGHTENED ON CALIFORNIA CULTURE

<P>
Just as I concluded that common sense, creativity, and intelligence didn't get 
printed much west of the Mississippi River, Itabari Njeri presents two great 
articles of enlightenment in one Times View issue. Why? What? Is this 
California culture -- without sand? 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 19, "A City of Poets: L.A. Emerges as a Place of Verse, Diversity" on 
the Los Angeles Poetry Festival and "The Compelling Stories of a Conquered 
Nation," an overview of the life of UCLA professor, Paula Gunn Allen, appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Alas! My East Coast snobbery and elitism can't be sustained if you continue to 
print information on Western great minds. 
</P>
<P>

DINKINS' NO-WIN MEDIA BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Dinkins Descending" (Oct. 28): If ever a public official was in a no-win 
position, it's New York Mayor David Dinkins. Because he has a low-key, 
deliberative political style, he is accused of being indecisive. Because he 
studies the issues and does not seek to inflame and polarize his constituents, 
as did his predecessor Ed Koch, he is criticized for being ponderous and 
boring. 
</P>
<P>
Because Dinkins does not immediately hire hundreds more policemen despite a 
budget shortfall in his city of more than $1.5 billion, he is said to be 
indifferent to crime. Because he did not fly to Utah (presumably at taxpayers' 
expense) to attend the funeral of a white tourist killed during a hold-up, he 
is accused of being insensitive to the victim and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the critics did not demand that Dinkins attend the funerals of the dozens 
of blacks who are murdered yearly in the city. And if he had flown to Utah, you 
can bet these same critics would have turned around and accused him of 
political grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Now, here is the final rub. Because Dinkins dresses tastefully, speaks proper 
English, likes tennis, believes in personal hygiene and is family oriented, he 
is accused of having a quirky lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't we stop all this nonsense and call the carping against Dinkins what 
it really is: racism. Dinkins inherited the reins of a bankrupt, decaying, 
crime-prone city. Like Koch before him, he cannot wave a magic wand and make 
New York's mountainous ills disappear. But unlike Koch, Dinkins is black and 
has become the convenient scapegoat of frustrated New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
My message to Dinkins is this: Ignore your detractors. Play all the tennis and 
take as many showers as you want. You're doing as good a job as anyone else 
could hope to do in a miserable situation.

ALICE KAHN: BY, FOR AND ABOUT BABY BOOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first generation to have almost universal access to higher education may 
also be the first generation to give up reading. Unless they are reading about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
If the newspaper business is in big trouble it's because it has failed to 
pamper baby boomers. Newspapers must cater to them and entertain them the way 
"Howdy Doody" did. The alternative press has figured this out. It understands 
that baby boomers are incredibly egocentric. So it has created a literature by 
the boomers, for the boomers, about the boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Look, I've been up to my ears in baby boomers since I was a baby. I'm willing 
to bet that if you are a baby boomer you are reading this simply because it is 
about you. 
</P>
<P>
A group of weekly alternative papers recently put an ad in Advertising Age 
flaunting this generational love-in. There's good news and bad news for 
newspapers, says the ad. The bad news is that newspapers are losing readers and 
"skewing older." The good news is that weekly alternatives deliver "a prime, 
targeted, upscale audience of 8.5 million young professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Put that in your pipe and skew it. 
</P>
<P>
One way these papers are attracting baby boomers is by understanding that the 
boomers are style freaks. The beautiful ads in some of these papers are often 
more attractive than the stories. If you see something in a newspaper that 
looks like a Gauguin but is actually an ad for a futon sale then you are 
reading a paper that is catering to baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers won't grow up. Only those who worshiped at the church of Peter Pan 
themselves actually understand this. (I believed in fairies! I clapped!) 
There's money to be made in the never-grow-old service sectors. Picture Marlon 
Brando as he looks today, on a motorcycle in black leather as he appeared in 
"The Wild Ones." This is where a generation is heading. 
</P>
<P>
You're either on the Jeep or you're not. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly papers that are anti-Establishment appeal to baby boomers who will do 
anything to maintain the image of themselves as young and rebellious. They 
detest the label "middle class" as much as they detest middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers are divided into three classes: those who have to earn a living, 
those who are waiting to inherit wealth and those who already have their 
inherited wealth. The last group cares the most about the environment because 
they already own it. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boomers are always looking for safe working-class neighborhoods and 
working-class hangouts for sociological field trips. If a restaurant reviewer 
describes a place as having "working-class ambience," pretty soon you'll have a 
trendy place filled with people in Levi's Dockers drinking imported beer out of 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers define art in terms of rebelliousness, not aesthetics. They will 
watch "Twin Peaks" even if it makes no sense. They will declare any junk "art" 
if it is attacked as pornography. If I were a situationalist artist, I would 
invent a situation in which some old man called me "dirty." Then I'd sit back 
and let the Village Voice make me famous. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers carry on their rebellion when they have babies by insisting that 
they are raising their children differently from the way they were raised. 
Boomers all feel they were victimized by their childhood. Someday, we will have 
ads in the back of the weeklies for Adult Children of Adult Children. 
</P>
<P>
But grow older they will, and as they do, baby boomers will become nostalgia 
devotees like generations before. Already, we have seen Woodstock replacing Iwo 
Jima as the symbol of a generation's emotional commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Ye Olde Newspaper could fit into that nostalgia craze, but only if mainstream 
newspapers indulge the indulgent baby boomers. Otherwise, they'll take their 
8.5 million marbles and go watch cable.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: NEW AIRLINE SERVICE TO HO CHI MINH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lufthansa, the German national airline, has become the sixth Western air 
carrier to offer service to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, with the 
introduction of once-a-week passenger and freight service from Frankfurt, 
Germany, to the former South Vietnamese capital. 
</P>
<P>
Flights originating in Frankfurt will depart on Mondays and land the next day 
in Ho Chi Minh City, first stopping over in Singapore. Lufthansa has taken the 
step in response to the economic liberalization measures introduced by the 
Hanoi government, an airline spokesman said.

Creepy-Crawly: Georges Brossard has 250,000 bugs in his house, but people still 
come to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Brossard is founder and owner of the Montreal Insectarium, a museum dedicated 
to creatures with six legs or eight. On view are insects -- both dead and alive 
-- from 88 countries, including such rarities as the giant cockroach of 
Madagascar and the Malaysian cicada, the biggest and loudest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Brossard's home also features a 25-foot-high butterfly aviary and an 
insect/spider breeding laboratory. There's even a special ident-a-bug service, 
for people who find something creepy and want to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits are in French and English, as is the Insectarium's recorded message: 
(514) 872-8753.

Traffic Flow: Those long traffic lines at the border between Italy and Austria 
are gone now that Italy has lifted its 12-day ban on commercial road traffic 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, imposed in retaliation for Austria's refusal to increase the number of 
monthly permits for Italian trucks, had caused major traffic problems along the 
border.

OREGON SHEEP RANCHES OFFER A BIT OF NEW ZEALAND IN THE NORTHWEST

ROSEBURG, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a warm, late-summer afternoon, and lazy cloud shadows are drifting across 
the emerald hills. A border collie waits for a signal from its master, then 
cuts a tight circle around a flock of sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The air is sweet with the scent of newly mown hay. Fields are bright with 
wildflowers. There is bird song from the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The scene could be a sheep farm in New Zealand's pastoral South Island -- the 
kind of family farm that takes in visitors for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Well, New Zealand has come to southern Oregon's Douglas County. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep ranches and cattle ranches and country homes with fishing 
streams and gardens -- all offering rustic holidays for city folk. 
</P>
<P>
And now the country vacation idea is spreading from Douglas County to eastern 
Oregon, the Portland area and into southwestern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The rural properties, 21 at last count, are part of a hospitality network 
called Country Host Registry. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking dude ranches," says Evelyn Sonka, of Myrtle Creek, Ore., a 
founder of the registry. "We're offering a true picture of what country life is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
Travelers write or call Country Host Registry for a brochure that includes 
rates and descriptions of the properties. Reservations and payments are made 
through the registry office. 
</P>
<P>
Sonka and Pat Anderes, operating partners of the registry, do their best to 
match guests' interests with host families. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are many: On the Douglas County sheep ranches, visitors can 
watch lambing (usually February and March) and shearing (late March and April), 
help with chores or just relax. 
</P>
<P>
There are rural riverside homes featuring fly fishing or bait fishing for 
trout, salmon or steelhead. A host couple near Roseburg can arrange tours of 
timberlands and a sawmill. Others accent antiques, art, music and home cooking. 
For the energetic traveler, there are activities ranging from bicycle day trips 
to hiking and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
There is a llama ranch with guest facilities on two dozen acres of rolling 
pastures and woods in Oregon's Yamhill County. 
</P>
<P>
There are classy old homesteads close to Portland and Grants Pass for loafing. 
There is a quiet country cottage by a fishing hole on the Clackamas River, only 
16 miles east of downtown Portland. A bed and breakfast inn near Eugene offers 
rides in a vintage shay pulled by a grand champion donkey by the name of Black 
Bart. 
</P>
<P>
All of the hosts guarantee hearty farm breakfasts as part of the packages. 
Several serve lunch and/or dinner, at extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the country homes welcome children. A few even permit pets. 
</P>
<P>
The country-culture concept is the result of a trip by Douglas County farmers 
to New Zealand in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wilkinson, a former high-school teacher and agricultural extension agent, 
led the tour that included stays at four Kiwi sheep ranches. The group included 
Evelyn Sonka and her husband, Louis, and Virginia Wilkinson, Don's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying home, Virginia and I were talking about our wonderful experiences 
during the farm-stays in New Zealand," Evelyn Sonka recalled. "We said, 'Gosh, 
we could do the same thing here in Douglas County.' " 
</P>
<P>
There were only four members in 1986, the first season.o 
</P>
<P>
The Sonkas began taking in travelers at their Sonka's Sheep Station, a 360-acre 
working ranch on the South Umpqua River, about 20 miles south of Roseburg. The 
Wilkinsons opened the doors at Shepherd's Meadow Inn, their 900-acre sheep 
ranch in Scotts Valley, near Yoncalla, about midway between Eugene and 
Roseburg. And soon a few nearby farmers began adding their homes to the list. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a place where the air is so fresh that it gets your attention. Swift 
border collies gather snowy flocks of sheep. There are lambs for children (and 
grown-ups) to cuddle. 
</P>
<P>
You have just arrived at Shepherd's Meadow Inn, one of Douglas County's 
showplace sheep ranches. 
</P>
<P>
Put away the neckties and high heels. Slip into something comfortable. And make 
the footwear so casual that you won't mind stepping on things that sheep leave 
behind when you go stepping out on the ranch. Meet Tess, a playful border 
collie that would rather fetch Frisbees than chase sheep. "She runs the place," 
says Virginia Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Then walk into the Wilkinson's "sick bay" paddock, home to the ill and injured 
of the ranch's sheep population. There are lambs rejected by their milkless 
mothers and head-banging rams injured in combat. 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead. Pick up a lamb and have a hug. Grab a pail of food pellets and help 
feed the patients. 
</P>
<P>
Go for a drive with Don Wilkinson and learn something about sheep. They're 
productive animals, providing both wool and meat. But they need a great deal of 
care. The ranch routine is busy. No time, Wilkinson says wistfully, for winter 
vacations in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas County alone has about 300 sheep ranches, large and small, with a total 
of more than 100,000 ewes. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilkinsons have the largest flock of New Zealand Coopworth sheep in the 
United States -- about 1,100 ewes and 1,500 lambs. Coopworths are noted for 
lustrous, high-quality wool. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson wool is sold directly to Oregon's Pendleton mills. But the main focus 
at Shepherd's Meadow is not wool, it's the rearing of purebred Coopworths as 
breeding stock for other producers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson selected 14 blood lines from top ranches in New Zealand for his 
stock, then faced what he calls "a nightmare of red tape" to get the sheep into 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Back-to-basics farm vacationing reminds Wilkinson of the way things used to be 
for many families. It was the time not so long ago when sentimental Norman 
Rockwell magazine covers really did mirror life in much of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandma and grandpa used to live on a farm, and the kids went there on 
vacation," Wilkinson says. "That's not the case any more, but these visits give 
folks a chance to sample agriculture as it really is, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have a very romanticized idea of country life. Well, it's a great 
life, but there's also a lot of hard work involved." 
</P>
<P>
While travelers are soaking up the rural atmosphere, there is a happy kind of 
feedback for the ranchers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"People get excited about what we do, and that boosts our energies," says 
Virginia Wilkinson. The "inn" at Shepherd's Meadow is the Wilkinsons' rambling 
home, less than a mile from the traffic thunder of Interstate 5. There are 
bedrooms for four guests, and the high-ceiling kitchen is as cozy as the one at 
grandma's house. 
</P>
<P>
Built originally for a large Scotts Valley family, the residence covers 4,400 
square feet. The Wilkinsons bought the place about three years ago and 
surrounded it with their sheep farm. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles to the south, Louis and Evelyn Sonka took over a charming, 
50-year-old home with a wraparound porch on property that once was a Myrtle 
Creek-area dairy. 
</P>
<P>
The antique-decked main house has two guest rooms. Evelyn Sonka's artistic 
touches have created picture-book country elegance. Close by is a guest cottage 
(it used to be the dairy's bunk house) with three more rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The sheep ranch part of the operation is leased to the Sonkas' son, Joe. 
Meanwhile, Louis helps with the sheep, and Evelyn is busy with Country Host 
Registry. 
</P>
<P>
Ask just about any visitor of any age to cite his or her favorite memory of a 
ranch vacation and the answer will likely be: "The dogs!" 
</P>
<P>
It's entertainment when the amazing border collies -- working by their owners' 
sparse hand signals, whistles or voice commands -- round up scattered flocks of 
sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs circle . . . crouching, stalking and locking eyes with would-be 
strays. A single dog can control dozens of sheep in a huge pasture as surely as 
if it had hypnotic control. 
</P>
<P>
"Come by," calls a rancher. His dog whirls around the perimeter of the field, 
collecting the sheep and herding them into a tight cluster. 
</P>
<P>
"Walk up, " the rancher shouts. The dog literally walks the sheep to its 
master's feet. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wilkinson has a 7-year-old border collie named Rex, a qualifier for the New 
Zealand championship before moving to Scotts Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Rex loves an audience. And, between chores, Wilkinson isn't at all shy about 
putting Rex through his paces for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Sonka's star collie is Wilkie. Wilkie is a wonder dog, too, when it comes 
to gathering sheep. Wilkie also knows some tricks, such as balancing atop 
fences like a tightrope performer when visitors are around. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie has a pal, Mel, another major talent for working the sheep. But Mel 
doesn't know any tricks. 
</P>
<P>
While Wilkie is showing off, frustrated Mel moves to the sidelines and starts 
gnawing on a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
"He always does that; I don't know why," Sonka says. "But he's real good with 
the sheep." 
</P>

THE TIMES SHOPPER: BARGAINS ON SWEATERS, SHAWLS, CRAFTS ARE PART OF ANY JOURNEY 
TO ECUADOR'S INDIAN VILLAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

IMBABURA, Ecuador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I had left the beaten track to visit Indian villages in the 
heartland of Ecuador -- a small, stable and hospitable nation between Colombia 
and Peru, where the scenery is spectacular and the bargains abound, 
particularly for top-quality woven goods. 
</P>
<P>
High in the Andes Mountains, not far from the Equator, we gazed out on old men 
trudging along, mounds of corn husks piled atop their backs, and women 
scrubbing clothes on rocks and bathing children in a secluded stream beneath 
majestic, snow-capped Mt. Imbabura. 
</P>
<P>
Otavalo Indians clad in traditional outfits of wide-brimmed black-felt hat, 
blue shirt and poncho, white pants or skirt and espadrille sandals awaited 
buses along the roadside. The men's hair was braided in long ponytails; the 
women wore layers of gold-colored glass beads, with the number of strands 
reflecting their relative wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The region is best known for its Saturday market in the town of Otavalo. This 
Saturday bazaar, located about 75 miles north of the capital of Quito, is 
deservedly renowned for its bright woven woolen shawls, hand-crafted sweaters, 
intricately designed bags and colorful folk art. 
</P>
<P>
We had visited the market the previous day and spent the night in a room with a 
roaring fire at Ecuador's oldest hacienda, built by the King of Spain in 1602. 
Now we were on our way to villages specializing in various crafts, including 
some of those sold at the market. 
</P>
<P>
Bumping along a dirt road, past men putting a thatched roof on a new home, we 
reached the village of Agato -- a small, prosperous weaving town in the 
foothills of Cotacachi. Brightly clad children with angelic, dusty faces played 
in front of substantial adobe homes. 
</P>
<P>
Luz Maria Andrango greeted us at her home, where music played, eight-grain 
alcohol was being served and a party was in full swing. The celebration had 
been prompted by the return of Andrango's husband from six months in the United 
States, where he was selling this famous family's beautifully hand-woven 
sweaters and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
Andrango's father, Miguel Andrango, is the only designated master weaver in all 
of South America. The quality of his products is reflected in the tightness and 
evenness of the weave, as well as the intricacy and originality of the designs. 
</P>
<P>
The family works together in the cluttered second-floor shop as part of a 
cooperative, Tahuantisuyo. Incongruously, a Rambo poster adorns a wall leading 
to the second-floor shop. A small television and Fisher tape deck sit amid 
rough-hewn rugs, potholders and vests. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the family works here, even the children. Many of the designs are 
created by Humberto Romero, 26, Luz Andrango's articulate and distinguished 
brother-in-law. He, too, wears traditional Otavalo colors, but his blue shirt 
is an Oxford, starched and impeccably pressed. 
</P>
<P>
Romero demonstrated for us his intensely physical technique at a finely honed 
loom of smooth, honey-colored wood. Seated on a pillow on the floor, he creates 
tension on the loom with a halter-like, cow-skin brace that slips around his 
back. After he weaves a strand, he pulls on various rods and pushes off with 
his feet against a wooden block, hoisting himself in the brace to pull the wool 
taut in the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
An apprentice to Andrango, Romero says he often travels to other Indian 
villages in search of new designs to perpetuate a culture that predates the 
Incas. He picks up an ornate, belt-like wall hanging to explain the meaning of 
the woven figures: 
</P>
<P>
A woman carrying a bird reflects the ritual of a godmother giving a gift in 
honor of a newborn. A deer recalls the tradition of sacrifices to the sun god. 
A fruit tree conjures up sustenance. A cow symbolizes nightmares because Indian 
lore teaches that dreaming of a bovine forebodes ill fortune. 
</P>
<P>
When an outsider visits an Indian's home, it is understood that prices will be 
lower than the going rate at the market. Bargaining, meanwhile, is not usually 
welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
It's also unnecessary. We bought three handsome cardigan sweaters for about $12 
each. A wall hanging that depicts four seated Indian women, one of Romero's 
designs, cost $5. 
</P>
<P>
In Sante Fe, N.M., Los Angeles and New York City, the family sells each sweater 
for $35. Retailers, in turn, price them several times higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Western influence in these villages is apparent through more than 
televisions and tape decks. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a young man clad in a New York Yankees warm-up jacket (complete with 
All-Star Game patch) as well as plastic toy cars in one home. And Luz 
Andrango's husband had just brought their son a new pair of L.A. Gear sneakers 
and other American-made clothing; we glimpsed the young man proudly admiring 
his new attire in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, as many residents were still making their way back from 
Otavalo, we had visited the nearby village of Peguche, with its rows of adobe 
homes and dusty, dog-filled plaza. A smiling woman welcomed us into her home, 
where the floor consisted of uneven stone and dirt, and corn dried above her 
stove. We bought two lovely knit scarfs for $7. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie, our guide, explained to us that even though Peguche is among the most 
affluent of Indian villages, it is considered inappropriate for Indians to 
display their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, some of those living in seemingly primitive conditions also drive 
late-model cars and pickup trucks, fruits of their growing export business. 
Indeed, we saw Indians behind the wheel of shiny new 1990 cars on the highway, 
but we never spotted one in a village. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Peguche, we visited the home and shop of Antonio Quinatoa, who 
presented us with his printed business card. From him, we bought a large, 
ornate tapestry with an original design of iguanas that was unlike anything we 
saw elsewhere. After some good-natured bargaining, we paid $28, a reflection of 
the enormous amount of work the piece entailed. 
</P>
<P>
We also bought a heavy crew-neck sweater for $9. Quinatoa said this would have 
cost $13 to $16 in the market. The going rate is far steeper when Quinatoa 
exports his work to Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
Before we departed, he showed us his bedroom, a striking site. Dogs and kittens 
abounded. And, to our amazement, there -- in a pile of straw beneath his bed -- 
were at least a half-dozen guinea pigs. Roasted and served whole, these animals 
are a national delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped at other villages as well. Cotacachi is a heavily commercial 
mountainside town that has little charm but incredible shopping. It is known as 
a center for leather goods made from goat, cow, snake and lizard skins. 
</P>
<P>
High-quality leather suitcases go for $25; a black leather jacket sells for 
$80. We bought a wallet for $5 and a woman's leather handbag with woven 
tapestry insets for $11. 
</P>
<P>
The Otavalo market itself is well worth the trip, which requires a sunrise 
start from Quito. It's open from 7 a.m. to noon, with a nearby animal auction 
that ends at about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The winding scenic drive along the Pan American Highway passes eucalyptus and 
pine trees, plus corn, onion, wheat and potato fields, and crosses the Equator. 
It takes about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Along the winding mountain roads, a visitor can see shrines erected to permit 
travelers to pray en route to their destinations. Roadside crosses mark the 
spot where ill-fated journeys abruptly ended. 
</P>
<P>
The market is a riot of colors -- blues, purples, reds and yellows of sweaters, 
baskets, scarves, hats and folk art in booths set up on the white square. 
Indians come to socialize as well as sell, sometimes over a popsicle purchased 
from the local ice cream vendor, who competes with those peddling tripe stew 
and the local equivalent of fried chitlins. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining here with the Indians -- people with high cheekbones, large brown 
eyes, wide lips, strong chins and warm smiles -- is of a gentler and kinder 
variety. The haggling is restrained compared to similar markets in Mexico or 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' native tongue is Quechua but many speak the national language, 
Spanish. If all else fails, a piece of paper passed back and forth with 
proposed prices will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
Musical instruments can be heard as well as seen. Among them is an ocarina, a 
flute-like, avocado-shaped piece with 10 finger holes. 
</P>
<P>
In small, remote villages, a young man seeking a girlfriend plays the melodic 
instrument in the village square. When eligible young women respond by 
appearing, he selects from among them. We were tempted to buy an ocarina for a 
hard-pressed friend back home, but decided it wouldn't have the desired effect 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of words of caution. Photo opportunities abound, but some of the 
Indians believe that taking their picture is tantamount to stealing their soul. 
By asking permission, you will immediately find out whether the subject 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the quality of some of the woven goods is not as high in the market as it 
is in the villages. Keep an eye out for an occasional missed stitch or 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
But bargains are plentiful. A whimsical 3 1/2-foot balsa wood carving of a 
snake chasing a bird up a tree was $8. A Panama hat -- named for where they are 
worn, not where they are made -- conveniently rolled up in an attractive wooden 
box was $7. Woolen shawls in dazzling hues of purple, blue and reds were $10. 
And we paid only $1 for five large, carved, wooden serving spoons. 
</P>
<P>
We left Otavalo and the surrounding villages concerned most about how we would 
manage to carry our treasures home and to whom we would parcel them out. 
</P>
<P>
We had followed the cardinal rule of such endeavors: We'd spent much more than 
we had planned, but undoubtedly less than we should have.

HOW TO VISIT ECUADOR'S SHOPPING MECCAS

<P>
Various American tour companies offer one- or two-day trips to the Otavalo 
market and surrounding villages, often as extensions to journeys to the 
Galapagos Islands or the Amazon. The fair is held on Saturdays from 7 a.m. 
until noon. 
</P>
<P>
A far cheaper alternative, however, is arranging such a tour directly with an 
Ecuadorian travel firm in Quito. Least expensive, particularly if you are 
adventuresome and someone in your party speaks Spanish, would be renting a car 
and doing the trip yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there: American Airlines has daily flights from Los Angeles to Quito 
via Miami. The lowest round-trip fare is $624. Ecuatoriana Airlines also offers 
direct service from Los Angeles to Quito via Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Hosteria La Mirage (Cotacachi, Ecuador; reservations handled 
through P.O. Box 11365, C.C.N.U., Quito) is a beautifully landscaped hotel less 
than four miles from Otavalo. Prices for the 14 rooms range from $40 to $60, 
double occupancy, per night, including a first-class dinner and continental 
breakfast at a covered patio looking out on mountain vistas. 
</P>
<P>
Hosteria Chorlavi (P.O. Box 828, Ibarra, Ecuador) is a 200-year-old hacienda 
with Old World charm that was known as the "Love Nest" when Inca men brought 
their wives there on honeymoons. Double rooms are $16 per night, including use 
of tennis and squash courts. 
</P>
<P>
Hacienda Cusin (San Pablo del Lago, Ecuador; reservations handled through 
Casilla Postal 428-A, Quito, Ecuador) was built by the King of Spain in 1602 as 
a large cattle farm, and is the oldest hacienda in Ecuador. Horses and ponies 
are available. Rooms are $35, including three meals. 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Hosteria La Mirage is a superb place to sample Ecuadorian cuisine 
in an attractive setting. Hosteria Chorlavi, 12 miles outside Otavalo, is 
another good choice for typical fare. Dinner for two without liquor is about 
$10 at each restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Try ceviche (shrimp or fish marinated in lemon juice), locro (potato soup made 
with cheese and avocados) and llapingachos (cheese and potatoes in a tortilla 
served with a fried egg on top). Ecuadorian beef is excellent and inexpensive. 
Mora sherbet, a cross between strawberry and grape, is a good dessert choice. 
</P>
<P>
Tour companies: Metropolitan Touring, C.P.O. Box 2542, Quito, Ecuador, or its 
U.S. representative, Adventure Associates, (800) 527-2500, is the largest tour

YOUTH BEAT: EXPERTS TELL WHAT SCAMS TO WATCH FOR WHILE SIGHTSEEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In 1972, newlyweds Tony and Maureen Wheeler set off on a journey from London 
across Asia. When they returned, friends asked them for information about the 
area. Now -- 18 years and 100 guidebooks later -- the Wheelers' company is 
considered a world leader in publishing advice for young, independent 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
What readers of the Lonely Planet series find most valuable is that the books 
not only provide detailed cultural background information on where to stay and 
how to get around in various countries, they also provide travelers with 
assurances that, yes, they, too, can do it. 
</P>
<P>
It's also reassuring that in 18 years of researching this style of travel, 
neither Tony nor Maureen has ever been seriously ill or robbed in a 
confrontational manner. "Every time we have had something stolen, we can put it 
down to being careless," Tony said. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian-based company has listened to a wide range of sad traveler tales 
from its readers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more prevalent problems faced recently by novice independent 
travelers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Malaysia, travelers have been taken in by airline ticket scams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Singapore, travelers have reported that they were approached in bars or 
hotels and told that another person is being set up. They are persuaded to play 
a roll in a complicated card game. They win a little, sign over their 
traveler's checks in belief that they are set to win a huge amount, and find 
themselves quickly parted from their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In India, problems reported are often connected with the buying of gems. 
</P>
<P>
Naive visitors are told that they can make a fortune reselling the gems at home 
and are shown "references" from hometown stores with familiar street addresses. 
Although warnings about this con game have been printed numerous times, 
travelers still get caught. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was that easy to make a fortune out of gems, there would be dealers all 
the way down the street. If you don't know gems, don't get involved," Maureen 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Although not a swindle, another common problem is connected with the purchase 
of Oriental carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers from Turkey have reported that after buying and carting carpets home, 
they discover that they could have purchased the same rug for less at home. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the problems can be sidestepped by common sense, more serious 
difficulties can be avoided by not getting into a vulnerable position in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Lonely Planet also has received a number of reports on the drugging of drinks 
on trains, on buses and in bars. 
</P>
<P>
It happens in a variety of ways in a variety of countries. Travelers are 
befriended, offered a drink and then wake up hours later to find their 
valuables missing.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: READERS FIND DISCOUNTS APLENTY IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
What's On in Las Vegas is a handy biweekly magazine that lists not only 
entertainment and other attractions around the city, but offers much helpful 
general information, too. 
</P>
<P>
In its regular feature, "What's On for the Young at Heart," it reports that 
seniors get 25% off regular rates at the St. Tropez Hotel, an all-suite, 
non-gaming hotel on Harmon Avenue off the Strip. Since the offer is subject to 
room availability, reservations are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace Station, also off the Strip on Sahara Avenue near Interstate 15, 
offers seniors a $30 rate Sunday through Thursday. And the Four Queens in 
downtown Las Vegas has a $35 rate during the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
For low-cost senior dining, the magazine suggests, among other places, the 
downtown Gold Strike Inn, which has a $1.99 senior dinner buffet from 3 to 10 
p.m. Tuesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also tells about the Southern Nevada University of Cosmetology, 
which gives a 20% discount on all services Thursday and Friday to those 60 
years and older. The Academy of Hair Design offers a similar discount on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, but sets the age at 62 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The column also tells of the Las Vegas Transit System's sizable senior offer, 
cited in this column before but worth repeating. All that's necessary is a 
Medicare card to get a 10-ride pass for $4.20. A regular Las Vegas bus ride is 
$1.10. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also informs readers of discounts on rental cars, motor scooters, 
even wheelchairs for $5 a day. Other senior deals are for bowling, shopping and 
various attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors can pick up a copy at any hotel in Las Vegas or send $2.50 to What's On 
in Las Vegas Magazine, 610 S. Third St., Las Vegas, Nev. 89101. 
</P>
<P>
Also from Las Vegas is a $2 reference guide published by the Las Vegas Advisor. 
It's not specifically for mature travelers, but has good tips for those looking 
for the best deals in meals and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The small-but-handy, single-sheet guide includes other senior-oriented data, 
such as the five casinos in town with penny slots. Other features are the costs 
of all Las Vegas production shows, plus a map and toll-free numbers for all 
casinos and other travel services. Send $2 to Huntington Press, P.O. Box 28042, 
Las Vegas, Nev. 89126 
</P>
<P>
Chandris Fantasy Cruises has announced a series of senior-saver Caribbean 
cruises for travelers 65 years and over next spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors who are the second occupant in a cabin with a full-fare passenger get 
50% off the regular cruise price, a savings that could be as high as $848 for a 
one-week cruise. That includes round-trip air fare from Los Angeles to the 
cruise departure point. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy Cruises include the Amerikanis and the Victoria. For more information, 
contact Chandris Fantasy Cruises at (800) 621-3446 or check with your travel 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers looking for Thanksgiving tours might want to check with 
Trieloff Tours, a longtime senior tour operator with STRAC. 
</P>
<P>
Trieloff will serve its Thanksgiving meals for seniors in Hawaii, Key West, 
Mexico and Australia. The meals will be served during a 10-day tour to Hawaii, 
a 13-day Florida tour, a weeklong Mexico cruise and a 22-day tour of the South 
Pacific. For more details or brochures, call Trieloff at (800) 432-7125. 
</P>
<P>
All nine Sheraton Hotels in Hawaii will repeat the chain's "Gold Guest" program 
from now to Dec. 20, offering a 25% room discount for AARP members and other 
mature travelers age 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
At check-in, guests also receive a Golden Guest card that allows additional 
discounts at selected Sheraton restaurants and shows, as well as more savings 
from local merchants and services. 
</P>
<P>
The 140 Rodeway Inns have been sold to Quality Inns, bringing the chain's 
number of hotels to more than 1,700. Quality Inns has since changed its name to 
Choice Hotels International. 
</P>
<P>
For now, no changes in senior discounts are planned at any of the hotels, which 
include Quality Inns, Clarion Hotels, Sleep Inns and Rodeway Inns.

Country properties: Country Host Registry is a reservations service 
representing 21 farms, ranches and rural homes that offer bed and 
breakfast-style lodging along with a taste of country life. All properties 
except one are in Oregon and range from working sheep farms in southern 
Oregon's Douglas County to secluded country homes near Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The only outside-Oregon property is a riverside homestead in White Salmon, 
Wash., in the Columbia River Gorge. Guest season varies from property to 
property. Some offer year-round lodging. Others are open to guests only in the 
summer season. 
</P>
<P>
Prices: Rates, with breakfast, range from about $45 to $95 per day for two; $5 
less for singles. Some hosts provide lunch and/or dinner. Adult prices for 
extra meals are $5 a person for lunch and $12.50 for dinner; $3.50 and $4.50 
for children under 12. Host families' names, addresses and driving directions 
are provided when reservations are confirmed. Payment in full to Country Host 
Registry is required with reservation requests. Drop-in traffic is not 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Restrictions: Most member properties accept children, but, in some cases, not 
small children. A few accept pets. "Restricted smoking" is the general rule, 
but there are exceptions. Because of insurance liability, not all hosts allow 
visitors to take part in farm chores. Each property sets its own policies. 
</P>
<P>

Creek, Ore. 97457, (503) 863-5168. Stanton H. Patty

Your article on New York City's friendliest small hotels was excellent, however 
you missed one that goes out of its way to be much kinder and gentler to its 
guests than many I have experienced: the Parc 51, 152 West 51st St.

of my own: the Salisbury Hotel, 123 West 57th St. -- pleasant surroundings, 
prompt room service and a staff that caters to the clientele. Also the Gramercy 
Park Hotel, 2 Lexington Ave. (at 21st Street), has Old World charm among the

Nuts! You've done it again. You just can't keep a secret, can you. 
</P>
<P>
This time it's Hua-Hin, Thailand ("A Royal Retreat," Traveling in Style, Oct. 
21). Back in the 1960s, when I discovered Hua-Hin, it was a beautiful escape 
from the then-less-crowded Bangkok. Last time I was there, it was all the 
nicer, especially after a couple weeks in the Bangkok of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
So now you tell the world about Hua-Hin. It's a great service to your readers 
and I guess that's what you strive for, but if it's overrun with tourists in 
the 1990s, I'll have to lay some of the blame on Stirling Silliphant's fine 
story.

PORGY, BESS AND UNCLE TOM; 
</P>
<P>
THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PORGY AND BESS; THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN CLASSIC BY 
HOLLIS ALPERT(ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 346 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Itabari Njeri, Njeri, a Times staff writer and former musician, is the 
author of Every Good-bye Ain't Gone, (Times Books), winner of a 1990 American 
Book Award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this. Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures allegedly proposed to George 
Gershwin: If "Porgy and Bess" makes it to the screen, "we could cast Al Jolson 
as Porgy, Fred Astaire as Sportin' Life . . . and Rita Hayworth as Bess." As 
Hollis Alpert reports in this journalistically styled survey, however, Gershwin 
by no means fancied the notion of a white cast in black face; earlier he had 
refused the same proposal from Jolson himself, agreeing with DuBose Heyward, 
the writer who created the seminal 1925 novel, "Porgy," that the story was 
meant for a black cast. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1912, "Porgy and Bess" purports to depict the harsh realities of life in 
Catfish Row, a Charleston, S.C., slum inhabited by blacks who speak Gullah, a 
Creole tongue that mixes English and West African languages. Porgy, an 
honorable, philosophical cripple on a goat-drawn cart, falls in love with Bess, 
a former prostitute kept by a murderous brute named Crown. Sportin' Life, a 
drug-peddling devil incarnate, tempts Bess from the path to salvation -- the 
love of a good man. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert's book focuses on those responsible for creating "Porgy and Bess" and on 
the behind-the-scenes struggle to stage the play and then the opera. Alpert 
sketches portraits of Heyward, his wife Dorothy, the Gershwins, acclaimed film 
maker Rouben Mamoulian -- director of the play and the first opera production 
-- and Robert Breen, the general director of the American National Theatre and 
Academy (ANTA) in the 1950s. Breen, whose life became enmeshed in the "Porgy 
and Bess" saga from the 1950s until his death in the 1970s, organized a tour of 
"Porgy and Bess" during the Cold War and fought to bring his stage version of 
the opera to the movie screen. He failed on the last score: Otto Preminger 
directed the critically unheralded motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
While succeeding generations of critics have not taken Heyward seriously as 
either a writer or dramatist, Alpert sees him as "one of the most important 
influences in opening up the American stage to black participation. The large 
casts for 'Porgy' as both play and opera gave great opportunity to a host of 
black performers, made new black stars, and gave white and mixed audiences a 
new appreciation of the talents of black performing artists. . . . It is a 
contribution that lives on." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert also acknowledges, however, that since the opera opened in New York, 
many African Americans have found it to be a kind of Uncle Tomism, a rip-off of 
black culture. Some of Gershwin's black detractors even have suggested that the 
music was stolen outright from melodies heard in black churches and then 
exploited for profit. 
</P>
<P>
There is some truth in these theories. That Gershwin culled African-American 
musical sources for "Porgy and Bess" has never been in doubt. Gershwin said so 
himself, as Alpert's book reports. But he used them as inspiration. It was not 
outright appropriation, as some still like to claim. In fact, as Alpert's book 
points out, Duke Ellington criticized the opera not only for its stereotypical 
portrayal of blacks but for its ersatz black music: "The times are here . . . 
to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms." And he complained that "the music 
does not hitch with the mood and spirit of the story. It does not use the Negro 
musical idiom." Still, Ellington thought it "grand music and a swell play, but 
the two didn't go together." 
</P>
<P>
With every generation, Alpert points out, black criticism of "Porgy and Bess" 
became harsher. Thirty-two years after the opera's New York opening, Harold 
Cruse, in his "The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual," called the work "the most 
contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World." He went so 
far as to demand that blacks never perform in it. 
</P>
<P>
Some modern-day resentment toward the play stems from the way the State 
Department exploited it during the Cold War to counter Communist propaganda 
about the virtual "enslavement" of black Americans. Breen, the American 
National Theater director, saw the tour as an "opportunity to show how blacks 
were rising in the cultural firmament," Alpert reports, "and at the same time 
to nullify propaganda about their lack of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
But while foreign audiences embraced "Porgy and Bess" casts featuring, among 
others, Leontyne Price, William Warfield, Maya Angelou and Cab Calloway, these 
artists had a tougher time at home. They were forced to use the "colored only" 
bathrooms in a suburban Washington restaurant, Alpert writes; to eat their food 
in a special basement room of the restaurant, and to use the back door of the 
Willard Hotel in the nation's capital to get to their hotel rooms -- which they 
had to find themselves once handed a key. 
</P>
<P>
Truman Capote, whom Alpert paints as a waspish and unethical journalist, wrote 
about the Russian tour of "Porgy and Bess" and shrewdly guessed that Soviet 
permission for the tour came from the "opera's message about people being happy 
when they have 'plenty of nothin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
As far as Cruse and many other critics are concerned, Jolson, Astaire and 
Hayworth should have had the starring roles. Clearly, though, Alpert doesn't 
see it that way. Playing objective reporter, he discusses the racism that 
surrounded Porgy and Bess, but he often sounds like an apologist. 
</P>
<P>
"The talented cast of 'Porgy and Bess' came from a host of schools and 
institutions," he writes. "Broadway and the New York opera and concert halls 
were still the primary lure, but it was a large country out there and its 
hunger for entertainment and culture provided opportunity for gifted black 
artists." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert seems to forget that it was not until 1955, when she was 53 and her 
vocal powers were fading, that the great African American contralto, Marian 
Anderson, made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera House. Racism had prevented 
an earlier debut. 
</P>
<P>
Leontyne Price, who first came to fame in the role of Bess in the 1952-54 road 
production of "Porgy and Bess," did not make her Metropolitan debut until 1961. 
And even though African Americans are now among the world's leading divas, 
black men still claim that they face enormous career obstacles in the operatic 
world. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that anyone purporting to play the role of historian is obligated to 
understand how people saw their own times but not obligated to adopt their 
language or point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Implicitly, Alpert suggests throughout this book that it was the largess of the 
liberal-minded whites associated with "Porgy and Bess " that gave blacks the 
opportunity to prove how talented they were. That paternalistic attitude is not 
a particularly endearing argument to African Americans or any other perceptive 
U.S. citizen in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, that's the way it was, so let's move on. Right? The problem, 
however, is that that's still the way it is -- the few exceptions only proving 
the rule. The same attitude that ticked off black people when "Porgy" was first 
staged enrages them now: that of Euro-Americans who believe they know and 
understand African American culture better than the people who created it, and, 
most important, have the social and economic power to impose their 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert misses this and other points throughout "The Life and Times of Porgy and 
Bess." "Life and Times" suggests, of course, that Alpert plans to provide 
context, but he in fact fails to examine seriously the cultural and racial 
issues that shaped the creation of "Porgy" or defined the social circumstances 
under which it has been performed. 
</P>
<P>
He tells us a little about the flowering of black literature, but his social 
history is maddeningly glib: "Ezra Pound was publishing his cantos, Fitzgerald 
telling his tales of the Jazz Age. T. S. Eliot saw it all as a 'Waste Land'. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert views much of the criticism of "Porgy and Bess" during the '60s and '70s 
as revisionist. Most African American artists weren't complaining when the show 
debuted, he points out. Well, given that it was virtually the only game in 
town, of course they weren't. How many opportunities did a classically trained 
African American singer have to perform in the United States until very 
recently, except for "Porgy and Bess"? 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, "Porgy and Bess" has helped define American culture. Its 
name conjures images of the nature of black life in America that are reinforced 
by similar contemporary stereotypes of so-called black-ghetto life in 
newspapers, films and on television. The problem, as always, is that there are 
not enough countervailing African American images in the popular media to 
balance the predominant portrayal of blacks as welfare queens, gang-bangers and 
dope peddlers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to "The Jeffersons," "Sanford and Son" and "Good Times," all of which 
Alpert cites, in a book published in 1990, as examples of shows that "carried 
their own stereotypes," just as "Porgy and Bess" does, but now with a "note of 
racial pride." Somehow it escaped him that the '80s sitcoms were not created by 
black writers but by white ones who thought they knew how African Americans 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
As a work filled with some interesting anecdotes (though most of them are from 
other writers' books), Alpert's effort offers some pleasant and occasionally 
amusing reading. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, toward the end of his book, he suggests that people just accept "Porgy 
and Bess" -- with all its outmoded sensibilities -- as a set piece. That seems 
sound. But to some people just discovering "Porgy," those sensibilities may not 
seem completely out of date. Take a real-life, 40-something-year-old man of 
color I know about, who had been passing as "white" all his life. Trying to 
impress an African-American woman, he told her he wanted to get her a new 
recording that was on sale: "You know, the Gershwin thing, Por . . . Por . . . 
Porky and Bess." 
</P>
<P>
Interpret the dynamics of that scenario, Mr. Alpert, and maybe you'll get a 
handle on the real life and times of P and B.

<P>
The drastic curtailments of modernism -- a Mies van Der Rohe tower, a Mondrian 
grid, a Beckett stage, a William Carlos Williams poem -- were a code to break 
through the proliferation of misleading messages in modern life, to an 
underlying reality. The codes of post-modernism are devised for their own sake; 
there is nothing beyond them. A smoke signal is an interesting pattern of 
smoke, a semaphore a striking collection of angles. The non-signaling signals 
tell us: 
</P>
<P>
That the world is unknowable and, if known, would be absurd. That all we can 
grasp are individual items and not what connects them. Individual cars but not 
transportation. Individual acts of love, but not love's mediation between self 
and a larger order of meaning. Individual acts of achievement: strokes of a 
jack that lifts us no higher because it rests on mud. Pearls without a string: 
We can't wear them; we pick them up one by one, and when one is picked up, 
another drops and rolls away. 
</P>
<P>
Modernism's temperature was cold, though the cold could burn. Post-modern 
temperatures are cool or tepid. Anger and violence is represented, but as 
decor. The real anger underneath comes out as a kind of passive withholding. 
The pearl is blamed for its lack of a string, but the blame is delivered all 
but invisibly. 
</P>
<P>
French writer Georges Perec, though not widely known in this country, is one of 
the great post-modernist spirits. Yet, as happens with the outsized figures in 
a style or a discipline -- generals who detest war -- he is partly a stranger 
to its purposes. Both his world and his style are in fragments, and unstrung; 
but each fragment has a sense of magical wholeness, as if the world's genetic 
code were imprinted on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Life: A User's Manual," published here in 1987, is a massive, dizzying 
collection of fictional data about several dozen tenants in a large Paris 
apartment house. Furniture, shoe laces, dust bins, a romance, a crime, a hand 
reaching out for a newspaper, are told of in equal and apparently dispassionate 
detail. Yet bit by bit, a universe of colors and emotions, of human stirrings 
and failures is created. Time moves them all, and Perec's masterpiece manages 
to make time palpable, fragrant and sad. 
</P>
<P>
There are hints of Perec's capacity for reverence amid alienating chaos in two 
of his earliest works: "Things" and "A Man Asleep." The novellas appear now in 
translations, respectively, by David Bellos and Andrew Leak. 
</P>
<P>
They are companion pieces, in a way. Written in the mid-1960s, each treats of 
the utter disconnection between people and their lives. In the first, a young 
couple long for nice things and a gracious style of living, but are unwilling 
to get into the slog and sacrifice of freedom that is required to secure them. 
In the second, a young man, similarly unwilling, turns into a recluse. 
</P>
<P>
"Things," being full of them, is the more engaging of the two, though less 
focused and ultimately, perhaps, less memorable. There is a lot of bittersweet 
fun in the story of Jerome and Sylvie and their material dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the Sorbonne, they are too taken with their grasshopper freedom to 
endure the ant-like ordeal of working for a really good degree. They go into 
market research: in those days, in France, a newly discovered, free-floating 
occupation. They interview Parisian housewives about potato-peelers or, gaining 
status, they travel around France to inquire about the potato-peelers in 
Bordeaux and Grenoble. 
</P>
<P>
They free-lance -- a full-time job would threaten their late-morning 
discussions -- and improvise midweek expeditions with equally loose-hanging 
friends. They have enough money for a young couple's initial trade-offs: a 
tiny, grubby apartment, but in a pleasant neighborhood; cheap, second-hand 
furniture, but one nice piece; scrappy, unmatched dishes for potluck feasts. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing accumulates. They come from lower-middle-class families; there is 
nothing in reserve. "They had no past, no tradition. There were no inheritances 
to wait for." And they cannot harness themselves to building anything up. Even 
at the feasts, no real pains are taken: 
</P>
<P>
"They liked the visible signs of abundance of riches; they would have no truck 
with the slow process of elaboration which turns difficult raw material into 
dishes." It was all pate, eggs in aspic and salads bought from the charcuterie. 
</P>
<P>
Bit by bit, though, the improvisation comes to seem less exciting. Their 
friends are no longer available; they have taken 12-hour-a-day executive jobs; 
they support babies and country cottages. Jerome and Sylvie hang back. "They 
could have made it, but all they wanted was to have it made . . . they wanted 
life, enjoyment, but all around them enjoyment was equated with ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, after a short-lived, disastrous effort to find the effortless good 
life in Tunisia, they drop their illusions. Like their friends, they wangle 
executive jobs, though in the provinces. They travel there by train; they dine 
in the first-class diner. 
</P>
<P>
"They will order two whiskeys. They will look at each other one last time with 
a smile of complicity. The starched table linen, the solid cutlery engraved 
with the arms of the Compagnie des Wagons-Lits, the weighty, emblazoned 
crockery will seem like a prelude to a sumptuous feast." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they too have it made. And then Perec adds: "But the meal they will be 
served will be simply tasteless . . . " The ant's store is as futile as the 
grasshopper's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the author is not simply lampooning Jerome's and Sylvie's dream-maneuvers. 
He writes with a ghost of tenderness. It is detached tenderness, like that of 
an archeologist who uncovers the ruins of a great city. That they are ruins, he 
has no doubt; that the city was beautiful is not affirmed, exactly, but offered 
as a troubled hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
"A Man Asleep" is told in the second-person singular, a device made celebrated 
by Perec's older contemporary, Michel Butor. It is the gauntest of forms. A 
solitary, speaking in the first person, has, at least, the dignity of the "I" 
and its vestigial sense of worth. To address oneself as "you" takes even that 
away; it is to approach oneself as a beggar. 
</P>
<P>
"You" is a young man tired of being a link in the chain of his own life. He was 
"a worthy son, a brave Boy Scout." Now, trying to study for exams, he is "a 
student who could have done better." He looks ahead to being a middle manager, 
an esteemed colleague, a good husband. And he refuses: "No. You prefer to be 
the missing piece of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
He drops classes and friends; he becomes "a man of leisure, a sleepwalker, a 
mollusk." Staying in his room by day, he walks at night, working to kill off 
all desire and choice. He chooses his routes by random formula. He reads every 
word in the newspaper, applying an equal and different attention to a Florida 
storm and a crossword puzzle. He goes to museums to look at pictures "as if 
they were part of the wall." 
</P>
<P>
He wants "to learn how to last . . . to want nothing." To scale down his 
requirements so that nothing can touch him. And gradually, he realizes, this 
refusal of choice is itself a choice. The realization transforms an emptiness 
which, for a reader, was becoming awfully empty. Suddenly Perec shows a beauty 
on the far side of the void; a humanity on the far side of refusal. 
</P>
<P>
"Solitude teaches you nothing . . . indifference teaches you nothing," the 
student tells himself. "It really does not matter whether you wish or you do 
not wish . . . your refusal is futile. Your neutrality is meaningless. Your 
inertia is just as vain as your anger." 
</P>
<P>
And in a final, suddenly radiant passage, he imagines thousands of Parisians 
standing in a rain-swept square, each in an individual reverie. He reflects: 
</P>
<P>
"No, you are not the nameless master of the world, the one on whom history had 
lost its hold, the one who no longer felt the rain falling, who did not see the 
approach of night. You are no longer the inaccessible, the limpid, the 
transparent one. You are afraid, you are waiting. You are waiting, on Place 
Clichy, for the rain to stop falling."

WORLDS IN COLLISION; 
</P>
<P>
MEAN SPIRIT BY LINDA HOGAN (ATHENEUM: $19.95; 370 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Kingsolver, Kingsolver's most recent books are Holding the Line: 
Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983 (ILR Press), and the novel 
Animal Dreams (HarperCollins). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Hogan, a Chickasaw writer with a fine reputation as a poet, has chosen as 
the subject of her first novel the Oklahoma oil boom of the 1920s. The Indians 
who had been forcibly resettled onto apparently worthless land suddenly found 
themselves in possession of one of the country's richest oil fields -- to their 
great misfortune. U.S. businessmen and government, as it happened, couldn't 
bear the sight of a rich Indian, and although the history of Native Americans 
since colonization is a fairly predictable story of betrayal and land theft, 
this chapter is a particular shocker. Only a poet could have made it both 
shocking and beautiful to read. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is set in Watona, where Osage and Creek families live in farmhouses 
above a great pool of oil, and one by one are turning up dead. An old 
water-diviner named Michael Horse watches his fire and tries to piece together 
the mystery. At church, the Rev. Joe Billy declares, "The Indian world is on a 
collision course with the white world. . . . They are waging a war with Earth. 
But, I say to you, our tears reach God." 
</P>
<P>
But God seems to be elsewhere when oilmen arrive unannounced to pump out the 
earth's black blood and pay the landowners as little as possible. When Moses 
Graycloud goes to collect the annual royalty payment that must support his 
family (since his land is ruined for farming), he's told that full-bloods now 
get only 10%: $200. Any who argue are declared insane and appointed the wards 
of white attorneys who handle their money. Some who can't pay their bills get a 
loan from the benevolent rancher and oilman John Hale, who secures the loan 
with a life-insurance policy on which he'll collect when they die. He never has 
to wait long. 
</P>
<P>
At the eye of the storm is Nola Blanket, beautiful daughter of the murdered 
Grace Blanket, heir to her mother's enormous oil fortune but also cherished 
progeny of the Hill People, who shun Watona's worldliness but send down four 
silent guardians to watch over Nola. 
</P>
<P>
She embodies every conflict of her time. She saw one of John Hale's men shoot 
her mother, but if she reports this it surely will end her own life. She is a 
child scarred by horror, but also a gentle, unearthly beauty who inspires love 
and fear in her oppressors. She brilliantly defies her boarding-school 
teachers, but then agrees to marry the son of her court-appointed warden 
because she knows her presence in Moses and Belle Graycloud's home endangers 
them. She spends her money on a wildly opulent wedding and extravagant gifts 
for her people. When she becomes pregnant, she talks constantly to "her 
future," the only thing left for her to trust. 
</P>
<P>
Nola's story is woven together with that of Belle Graycloud, who listens to 
bees and wears a meteorite around her neck; of Stacey Red Hawk, a smart Lakota 
Sioux who tucks his braids into his hat and goes to Washington in hopes that 
law enforcement can be made honest; of mute John Stink, who crawls from his 
grave and walks the Earth more freely as a ghost than he could in life. 
</P>
<P>
The tapestry is as well made as a good mystery novel, but equally compelling 
for its vivid language and characters. When Belle Graycloud happens on a 
truckload of sacred eagles "with the blue-white membranes of death closed over 
their eyes," shot by hunters who will sell them for souvenirs, they look to her 
"like a tribe of small, gone people, murdered and taken away in the back of a 
truck." When Nola Blanket's husband gives her an emerald-green parrot, she 
walks like an apparition to the window and sets it free. 
</P>
<P>
This is North American magic realism; in the same way Gabriel Garcia Marquez 
and Isabel Allende examine their political history with a conjurer's eye, Hogan 
has wrapped wonder and magic around some brutal American truths. Neither magic 
nor truth is diminished by the association. 
</P>
<P>
The story, though relentlessly sad, is leavened throughout with a circumspect 
humor, as when Michael Horse retreats to the hills to write a new chapter of 
the Bible: The Book of Horse. He consults a dismayed priest for advice on how 
to get it copyrighted and included in the Bible. Horse modestly tells him: "The 
Bible is full of mistakes. I thought I would correct them. For instance, where 
does it say that all living things are equal?" 
</P>
<P>
"The priest shook his head. 'It doesn't say that. It says man has dominion over 
the creatures of the earth.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Well, that's where it needs to be fixed. That's part of the trouble, don't 
you see?' " 
</P>
<P>
The stereotype of the stoic Indian who does not flinch as he's beaten was 
probably invented by a guilty conscience. The Indians in this novel aren't 
stoic. When they can, they laugh and make love; when they can't, they weep and 
lock themselves in the cellar. When their own traditions can't guide them or 
blunt their despair, they turn to liquor and Ouija boards. They aren't "other," 
they're ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan has done one of the finest things a novelist can do: She's created 
empathy. She carves a vast tragedy down to a size and shape that will fit into 
a human heart. It's an important event, because this chance to fully realize a 
point of view alien to our own -- this empathy -- is the thing that may just 
save us in the end.

SEPARATE BUT EQUAL; 
</P>
<P>
MAKING SEX; BODY AND GENDER FROM THE GREEKS TO FREUD BY THOMAS LAQUEUR (HARVARD 
UNIVERSITY PRESS: $27.95; 302 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Robinson, Robinson is professor of history at Stanford University and 
the author of The Modernization of Sex (Cornell University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You might think that the anatomy of male and female genitals is so obvious that 
there could never be much historical disagreement about them. But the chief 
virtue of Thomas Laqueur's "Making Sex" -- a study of ideas about sexual 
anatomy and reproductive physiology from the ancient world to the present -- is 
that it disturbs any such easy conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Recent scholarship has made us aware that gender is to a considerable extent 
"socially constructed," meaning that notions about the differences between men 
and women vary remarkably over time. But Prof. Laqueur's contention is more 
radical: He insists that the way people conceive of sexual organs themselves is 
also historically contingent. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two millennia, Laqueur contends, there have been two dominant 
conceptions of sexual difference. The first, which held sway from classical 
Greece until the Enlightenment, he calls the "one-sex model," while its 
successor during the past two centuries turns out to be (not surprisingly) the 
"two-sex model." 
</P>
<P>
The one-sex model was articulated by such ancient medical authorities as 
Aristotle and Galen. Its central precept was that there is, in essence, only a 
single sex, namely the male. Laqueur is not so foolish as to argue that the 
ancients could see no difference between male and female genitalia. His point 
is that when they thought about the female genitals, they interpreted them as a 
version of the male organs. To be precise, they believed that female genital 
anatomy was an involution of male anatomy. Thus they describe the vagina as an 
internal penis, the womb as an internal scrotum and the ovaries as internal 
testicles -- which, logically, lay outside the womb, since the whole male 
apparatus has been turned inside out (or, perhaps more accurately, outside in). 
</P>
<P>
From this conception followed several consequences. The most important was that 
the ancients (and their European successors down to the Enlightenment) took it 
for granted that women's sexual desire and sexual pleasure were virtually 
identical to men's. Since women had, in effect, the same organs as men, they 
naturally had the same feelings. Thus nobody would have thought to propose that 
they didn't experience orgasms. 
</P>
<P>
What led the ancients to embrace the one-sex model? Laqueur has no difficulty 
convincing us that it had nothing to do with observation. The very fact that we 
find their ideas so quaint -- if not to say preposterous -- relieves him of 
that responsibility. Instead, he speculates (for speculation is our only 
recourse when trying to answer such a question) that it reflected a broader 
conceptual scheme encompassing the whole of reality. 
</P>
<P>
That conceptual scheme held that the world is organized hierarchically, from 
God at the apex, down through animate beings and plants, and bottoming out in 
the realm of immaterial objects. In this hierarchy, women were naturally placed 
below men. More exactly, the interests of patriarchy led ancient authorities to 
conceive of women as, in effect, lesser men. 
</P>
<P>
The very legitimacy of their hierarchical social order, Laqueur believes, was 
at stake in such a conception. This imperative in turn inhibited any notion of 
female anatomy as antithetical to male anatomy, since women's subordination 
depended precisely on their being conceived of as similar, albeit inferior, to 
men. They were one rung (or link) lower on the great chain of being, and this 
assumption made possible the peculiar notion that their genitals were an 
imploded version of male genitals. 
</P>
<P>
The two-sex model, by way of contrast, holds that women's sexual organs are not 
lesser versions of men's but simply different. You might say that a vertical 
conception has given way to a horizontal one. Laqueur shows 18th- and 
19th-Century authorities explicitly rejecting the ancient notion of genital 
resemblance and insisting instead on genital opposition. To be accurate, he 
concedes that some modern authorities (such as Freud) continued to employ the 
one-sex model, but the two-sex model became the norm. 
</P>
<P>
A chief result of this change was the belief, introduced in the 19th Century, 
that women are largely passionless. Laqueur does not take sides in the ongoing 
debate about how widespread this notion was. He is satisfied to suggest that it 
could have been broached only when the two-sex model displaced the one-sex 
model and thus made it conceivable that a woman's sexual response might be 
utterly unlike a man's. 
</P>
<P>
And what accounts for the triumph of the two-sex model in the modern world? One 
thing is certain, in Laqueur's opinion: It has not triumphed because it is 
correct or because it has been championed by modern science. It is, he admits, 
on the whole closer to the truth than the old model, but he is at pains to 
discredit the Whiggish notion that we now see the genitals aright because, with 
the aid of science, we have taken a long, careful, and disinterested look at 
them. For centuries, science dutifully produced evidence supporting the one-sex 
model, and since the Enlightenment, it has produced a good deal of bogus 
physiological evidence that actually contradicts the two-sex model. Once again, 
larger cultural forces seem to be at work. 
</P>
<P>
To be frank, I find Laqueur's exposition of those larger forces among the more 
obscure aspects of his argument. If I understand him correctly, he wants to 
link the idea of radical genital opposition to the emergence of a democratic 
conception of society during the Enlightenment. That is, the 18th Century 
rejected the idea of hierarchy and replaced it, in theory, with the idea that 
human beings are essentially equal. 
</P>
<P>
If taken literally, this idea would have threatened male supremacy, since women 
could claim to be indistinguishable from men. With the idea of women's 
hierarchical inferiority discredited, men were forced to substitute the idea of 
a categorical biological divide between the sexes, from which the two-sex model 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
I am reluctant to complain that Laqueur's argument is at times overly 
schematic, or that he occasionally seems to be wrestling his evidence into 
conceptual submission. Ambitious historical constructs, particularly in the 
murky region of human sexuality, are rare commodities that need a certain 
amount of intellectual indulgence, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for 
proposing so bold and important a hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
I do wish he had been able to present it more plainly, just as I wish that his 
publisher had seen fit to supply him with better anatomical illustrations. The 
latter are so small, dark and blurry that one often cannot identify the 
telltale physical distinctions that Laqueur explicates so lovingly in his text.

CELEBRATING FIFTY By Karen Blaker (Contemporary Books: $17.95; 192 pp.). This 
collection of conversations with women who hover near 50 reads, sadly, like the 
tepid outtakes of Barbara Raskin's novel, "Hot Flashes." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Blaker's subjects suffer from an unfortunate homogeneity both of 
circumstance and attitude. Most are moms of almost-grown children, or 
grandmoms; hasn't Blaker noticed that there's about to be a generation of 
50-year-old women whose kids are still in elementary school? Most are 
economically comfortable, educated, naturally reflective women -- just the ones 
for whom turning 50 is likely to be easiest. The book suggests that a woman of 
50 needs to be her own best advocate, refusing to accept the received wisdom 
about what can, and should, be an energetic period in her life. But Blaker does 
little to empower the reader. Her subjects are too glib, her questions too 
bland. It's hard not to get angry, reading this effort. Blaker's intended 
audience deserves more than tea and sympathy.

TRIAL BY FIRE: A Woman Correspondent's Journey to the Frontline By Kathleen 
Barnes (Thunder's Mouth Press: $19.95; 256 pp.). Kathleen Barnes chases stories 
written in blood. 
</P>
<P>
Covering that kind of carnage, from Northern Ireland to the Philippines, should 
be a young person's job, but Barnes came to it in her mid-30s, fleeing a 
pleasant life as a reporter on a small-town daily in Upstate New York, the wife 
of another reporter perfectly content to cover a place she found stultifying. 
Her book is an absorbing memoir of her six years in the midst of the depravity 
born of intractable religious and political differences. If it does not cross 
the line to art -- if she fails to step back and describe events with the 
perspective available to someone not meeting daily deadlines -- it is still a 
valuable reminder of the outrages people (too much like us) commit in the name 
of God and state. Karen Stabiner

AVA: My Story By Ava Gardner (Bantam: $19.95; 315 pp.). The nicest thing ever 
said about her, writes Ava Gardner, was George Cukor's calling her "a 
gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why she liked the term; though Ava often drank into the wee 
hours, and addresses her readers as "honey," she never traded in her North 
Carolina farm-girl soul for the Hollywood model. Stardom, she writes, "gave me 
everything I never wanted," and she admits she wasn't a great actress despite 
good notices for films such as "The Sun Also Rises" and "The Night of the 
Iguana." And her love life indeed proves as interesting as her career, boasting 
an all-star cast; her three husbands were Mickey Rooney, bandleader Artie Shaw 
and Frank Sinatra. None of her bed partners comes off very well, which suits 
the mood of this autobiography (assisted by Alan Burgess and interim Los 
Angeles Times book editor Kenneth Turan): lighthearted, but with an 
undercurrent of sadness and resigned dissatisfaction. Chris Goodrich

ON EDNA O'BRIEN'S 'LANTERN SLIDES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS CAHILL, Cahill is co-author of A Literary Guide to Ireland and 
Director of Religious Publishing at Doubleday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A writer's life is filled with lies, most of them not of her own making. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor Mrs. O'Brien," says the countrywomen of rural Clare in speaking of Edna 
O'Brien's late mother. "Sure, she tried to hold her head up, but . . . (shrug) 
well, y'know, with a daughter like That Wan. Ah, the poor t'ing, didn't she 
travel all the way to London to visit That Wan and when she got there didn't 
she find there wasn't a stick of proper furniture to be found in the entire 
flat -- just pillows on the floor?" Of course, the content of That Wan's novels 
and stories lie beyond all possibility of comment. They are, literally, 
unspeakable. Far easier to pronounce authoritative condemnations on her decor. 
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, whither Edna fled her rural life, they recall her mad, shop-girl 
involvement with a prominent Anglo-Irish statesman, who, they aver, "taught her 
to be above herself, to have notions." They recall her marriage to a mild, 
reticent man ("You wouldn't know he was in the room"), who taught her to write 
("She hadn't a clue"). Note the nice balance in this analysis: He was of no 
account, yet he was wholly responsible for her later fame and fortune. From 
these years came "The Country Girls Trilogy," first novels that tore across the 
literary sky like comets whose tails we have yet to see the last of. 
</P>
<P>
In London, whither she fled her provincial Dublin life, they speak of her with 
admiration and a kind of tender pity as for one "beautiful and . . . (shrug) 
well, doomed, rather" -- a hopeless Celt who finds tragedy everywhere, 
especially in all those places where the English find reason only to titter and 
be smug. A romantic among the impervious Nigels and Beryls. And yet, the spell 
O'Brien casts does have its uses. "I always take along an Edna O'Brien to read 
on trains," confided one Beryl, "because then I'll always be picked up by the 
right sort." Quite. 
</P>
<P>
On her occasional sallies into New York, O'Brien leaves a sea of dazed admirers 
in her wake, all dazzled and bewitched by her unearthly beauty, her diabolical 
talent. Her reputation, both here and in London, almost threatens to overwhelm 
her work -- to elevate her to that High Empyrean where, with a few other living 
figures like Graham Greene, she may exist beyond criticism or reproach. 
</P>
<P>
But all these lies and half-truths cannot really disguise the permanent, 
universal value of her work. The fictional Irish village she returns to again 
and again is her village and your village. In "Oft in the Stilly Night," the 
opening story of "Lantern Slides," she tells us of a woman sacristan who goes 
mad: "Now I ask you, what would you do? Would you comfort (her), would you tell 
her that her sins were of her own imagining? . . . Would you loiter with the 
drunkards and laugh with the women gorging the white bread; would you perhaps 
visit the grave to say an Aye where Angela . . . and the errant husband lie 
close together, morsels for the maggots, or would you drive on helter-skelter, 
the radio at full-blast? Perhaps your own village is much the same, perhaps 
everywhere is, perhaps pity is a luxury and deliverance a thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
In "A Little Holiday" in the same collection she gives us a 9-year-old 
Everychild whose first holiday adventure proves an immense disappointment. She 
had thought to escape the crabbedness of her own household by visiting a 
seaside aunt and uncle, whose domestic establishment proves to be even more 
bleak than her parents'. Hysterical and forlorn, she is returned home in 
disgrace. "Part of me wanted to volunteer to go back with them, while another 
part admitted that that would be absurd. Either way, I knew that I had lost 
some part of my parents' love and God only knows how long it would take to win 
it back -- days, weeks maybe, of slaving and washing up and shining at school. 
But even then it could come up at any time, this failure of mine, an added 
incentive for an outburst, another blind grope in which my mother and father 
were trying to tell each other how unhappy they were." 
</P>
<P>
She is a storyteller, an Irish storyteller, one of an ancient tradition of 
storytellers, people who tell the truth. In old Ireland, the words of a 
truthful poet were both sought and feared: They could kill. Her best work has 
the sound of something prehistoric -- palpable, thrilling, incantatory -- about 
it. It should be read aloud, like poetry. It is, indeed, not prose, at least 
not in any modern manner. 
</P>
<P>
Her plots are devastating, not a happy one among them, though they are 
intensely full of sensuous joys. Her scenes are both archetypal and resolutely 
naturalistic -- the claustrophobic, incestuous farmhouses of Ireland, the 
soiled beds of England, the desperate pleasures of a Mediterranean holiday. 
</P>
<P>
She writes with the sureness and conviction of a priestess or prophet, one of a 
long procession of prophetic Irishwomen -- from Briget and Ita in late 
antiquity, through Dark Eileen O'Connell (whose Sophoclean "Lament for Art 
O'Leary" is one of the world's great poems), to Lady Gregory and Mary Lavin and 
Maeve Brennan -- surely the boldest tradition of women writers in all 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Edna O'Brien writes about love and death, the only two things that can ever 
matter to a great writer. She tells the truth. 
</P>
<P>
And no one should expect to be thanked for telling the truth.

1990 BOOK PRIZE WINNER: HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
ON RICHARD FLETCHER'S 'THE QUEST FOR EL CID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL McGAHA, McGaha is professor of Romance Languages at Pomona College 
and editor of the journal Cervantes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As anyone who has ever taken a course in medieval Spanish history can attest, 
the subject is nightmarishly complicated. When Rodrigo Diaz, who would later be 
known as El Cid, was born around 1043, the southern two-thirds of the Iberian 
peninsula, Al-Andalus, was still under Muslim rule, but the formerly unified 
caliphate of Cordova had broken down into a score of tiny city-states known as 
taifas. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern, Christian portion of the peninsula was divided into the rival 
kingdoms of Castile-Leon, Navarre, Aragon, and the county of Barcelona. 
Frontiers constantly shifted as the various petty rulers formed alliances that 
often cut across religious lines in their relentless efforts to conquer and 
exploit their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Although by the year 1000 the population of Spain is thought to have been 75% 
Muslim, Christians lived and practiced their religion throughout Al-Andalus, 
while many Muslims lived in Christian territory, and there were important 
Jewish settlements throughout the peninsula. Large sectors of the population 
were bilingual or even trilingual, and intermarriage and conversion from one 
religion to another were commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The great virtue of Fletcher's "The Quest for El Cid" is that he manages to 
bring some order out of all that chaos and to tell the story of those long ago, 
turbulent times in a way that is both comprehensible and fascinating to the 
modern reader. The title, which strikingly parallels Schweitzer's "The Quest of 
the Historical Jesus," is somewhat misleading. Fletcher's stated purpose is to 
strip away the layers of myth and legend that somehow transformed a rather 
opportunistic mercenary warlord who fought for both Muslims and Christians into 
Spain's national hero, "the crusading warrior who waged wars of re-conquest for 
the triumph of the Cross over the Crescent and the liberation of the fatherland 
from the Moors." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, though there may be a few laymen who still cherish the heroic image of 
El Cid portrayed in late 19th- and early 20th-century children's books and in 
the 1961 Charlton Heston film, the true facts of Rodrigo Diaz's career have 
been well known since at least 1849, when Reinhardt Dozy published his 
iconoclastic "Recherches sur L'histoire et la litterature de l'Espagne pendant 
le moyen age." Fletcher contributes no new material that significantly alters 
Dozy's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher is a sophisticated historian who knows how to read his sources -- both 
medieval and modern -- critically, probing beneath the surface for the biases 
that led earlier historians to emphasize certain events while ignoring others. 
For example, he astutely points out that Evariste Levi-Provencal, as a 
Parisian, "was culturally attuned to centralism and regarded the provinces as 
shabby and distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, his account of 10th-Century Islamic Spain needs to be balanced by a more 
thorough study of events in the provinces. Fletcher obviously does not believe 
in the possibility of truly objective history. All historical narratives, he 
insists, are filtered through the minds of historians whose writing is 
inevitably colored by their own conscious or unconscious prejudices. That of 
course raises the question: what hidden agenda was Fletcher promoting in 
writing this book? 
</P>
<P>
The answer lurks between the lines of almost every page of this book. Fletcher 
is a proponent of global culture, the notion that men and women all over the 
world are basically alike, and that the concept of uniquely national cultures 
is a dangerous and outdated idea. He loathes Ramon Menendez-Pidal's "La Espana 
del Cid" precisely because it is, in Azorin's words, "a wonderful lesson in 
patriotism." The fact that Franco exploited Menendez-Pidal's portrayal of the 
Cid as the embodiment of the unique and admirable qualities of the Castilian 
spirit makes that image all the more odious and deserving of deflation. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher cannot avoid the fact that the Spanish people have been notoriously 
resistant to the imposition of a central political authority, but he argues 
that "this is not owning to any stubborn streak of cussedness or pride in the 
Spanish character. It arises simply from the size and physical conformation of 
the Peninsula." The fact is that other, larger nations divided by more 
formidable physical barriers have in fact developed a very strong sense of 
national unity. As the tourist posters used to remind us, "Spain is different," 
and it is different in much the same ways that the Muslim world is different. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher argues that the Poema largely responsible for creating the myth of the 
Cid was written during the turbulent reign of Alfonso VIII, when the kingdom 
was imperiled by "those who put sectional interest before the common good, who 
neglected their Christian patriotism and forgot their duties to the king. The 
poet reminded his compatriots of where their responsibilities lay." If that 
were true, why would the poet have portrayed Alfonso VI in such a negative 
manner? Why the famous refrain, which Spaniards have had reason to repeat all 
too often in their later history: "God, what a good vassal, if only he had a 
good lord!" Fletcher quotes Dozy's description of the Cid as "more Muslim than 
Catholic" -- a statement which has far-reaching implications, but which he does 
not choose to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
The uniqueness of Spanish culture derives from the coexistence during seven 
centuries of Christians, Muslims, and Jews -- unlike anything that occurred 
anywhere else in Europe. Fletcher argues that "the most striking feature about 
(Spanish) Christendom's reaction to Islam was incomprehension. At least, that 
is what we would call it today. 
</P>
<P>
Early medieval Christians would have been scandalized to have their reactions 
characterized in this manner, but we live today in an atmosphere of religious 
pluralism." It is hard to imagine any other time or place history more 
characterized by religious pluralism than medieval Spain. The tragedy is that 
that rich pluralism was ultimately destroyed. Perhaps the most important lesson 
we can learn from medieval Spanish history is not that cultural differences are 
illusory or unimportant, as Fletcher seems to suggest, but rather that there is 
much of value to be gained from a unity founded on respect for diversity.

<P>
ON O.B. HARDISON'S 'DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK C. TAYLOR, Taylor teaches at Williams College and is writing a book on 
20th-Century religion, painting and architecture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a popular variation of an Indian creation story, a young boy asks his father 
what holds up the world. Well-versed in mythology, the father promptly replies 
that the world rests on the back of a very large turtle. "But what holds up the 
turtle?," the boy asks. After a moment's reflection, the father responds, "A 
huge elephant." As might be expected, the son still is not satisfied and 
proceeds to ask, "And what is under the elephant?" Now thoroughly exasperated, 
the father declares, "Son, it's elephants all the way down!" 
</P>
<P>
What the East has long known but the West has only recently discovered is that 
we all need illusions of some kind to understand and impart order to our lives 
-- turtles and elephants or other kinds of fiction that help us comprehend 
experience. So understood, the father's reply might be translated: "Son, it's 
images all the way down." 
</P>
<P>
Poet Wallace Stevens, puts it this way: "The final belief is to believe in a 
fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The 
exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe it 
willingly." 
</P>
<P>
Many people deeply resist the claim that reality is essentially a matter of 
turtles and elephants or images, fictions and interpretations. Even Stevens is 
uneasy with his conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 To discover winter and know it well, to find, 
</P>
<P>
 Not to impose, not to have reasoned at all, 
</P>
<P>
 Out of nothing to have come on major weather, 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, possible, possible. It must 
</P>
<P>
 Be possible. It must be that in time 
</P>
<P>
 The real will from its crude beginnings come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In his remarkable book "Disappearing Through the Skylight: Culture and 
Technology in the Twentieth Century," O.B. Hardison Jr., University Professor 
at Georgetown University, responds to the urgency of Stevens' questioning: "In 
fact, it is impossible." We are necessarily prisoners of our preconceptions, he 
writes; "there is no way out. . . . We know nothing that has not been invested 
with ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
As culture evolves, "reality" itself becomes increasingly artificial, 
disappearing through "the skylight," our field of vision. In the modern world, 
concepts and images "no longer seem to objectify a real world." 
</P>
<P>
Hardison traces "the disappearance of the real world" in five interrelated 
areas: nature, history, language, art and human evolution. In the course of the 
argument, he brings together an extraordinary range of material from Dada to 
quantum physics, from Bauhaus architecture to Cyborgs, from Cubism to robots, 
to create a provocative interpretation of cultural change. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Hardison's questions and conclusions at first seem utterly baffling. 
The question, "Does nature exist?," seems absurd, for example, but Hardison 
asks it because he sees "nature" as a cultural artifact, a system of laws and 
assumptions "created in part by man." 
</P>
<P>
Thus physics, chemistry and other natural sciences are similar to the turtles 
and elephants in the Indian myth. They are, in a sense, artistic creations. 
</P>
<P>
When pushed far enough, modern science and modern art arrive at the same 
conclusion. "Modern art opens on a world whose reality is not 'out there' in 
nature defined as things . . . but 'in here' in the soul or mind." In a certain 
sense, modern science and technology join modern art to realize the dream of 
the avant-garde: The world is transformed into a work of art, and life becomes 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison shifts from analysis to prophecy in the closing pages of the book. 
Man, he contends, "is in the process of disappearing into the machines he has 
created." 
</P>
<P>
He sees hope rather than despair in the disappearance of man into machine. 
Invoking Teilhard de Chardin's notion of the "noosphere," in which the earth is 
"becoming enclosed in a single thinking envelope," Hardison concludes: "This 
sounds less like a death than a rebirth of humanity. Perhaps it is the moment 
of triumph of the noosphere. Perhaps, however, it is the moment at which the 
spirit finally separates itself from an outmoded vehicle. Perhaps it is a 
moment that realizes the age-old dream of the mystics of rising beyond the 
prison of the flesh to behold a light so brilliant it is a kind of darkness." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But there is a darker side to the tendencies Hardison so ably charts. 
The erasure of differences often is repressive rather than liberating. Sameness 
is not always desirable. The search for unity can become so all-consuming that 
individual and cultural differences simply are wiped away. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison's argument is haunted by a disturbing apocalypticism in which creation 
requires destruction. Though Hardison believes his argument is radically novel, 
he has actually rewritten a very old story by reinscribing the narrative of 
death and rebirth as the disappearance of man into the machine. No longer 
created in the image of God, man now creates God in his own image. Deus ex 
machina becomes Deus est machina, or, more precisely, Machina est Deus (the 
machine is God). 
</P>
<P>
For those who do not share Hardison's startling faith that "Silicon life will 
be immortal," the future is not necessarily so bright. While there is no 
possibility of turning back to a humanism long since grown stale, it would be a 
mistake to turn toward a future in which technology is deified. This century, 
above all others, should have learned that lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison's book ends not with a word but with an image -- the image is the 
well-known photograph of earth taken from the lunar surface. In this image, 
earth does not rest on turtles or elephants or anything else. Suspended in a 
dark void, it rests on nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In this darkness, it might well be that there is no way out of the skylight. 
Indeed, it might well be that the final belief is to believe in a fiction, 
which we know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. If, however, belief is 
necessarily fictive, then can we ever be as certain of our beliefs as Hardison 
allows himself to become? To claim that there is no way out is to claim to know 
more than we can ever know. Perhaps not all things are thinkable.

ON JOHN CADDY'S 'THE COLOR OF MESABI BONES'

John Caddy, here in the second stanza of his title poem, "The Color of Mesabi 
Bones," (Milkweed Editions) gives a rich and grim description of the Mesabi 
Range of his childhood. The Mesabi Range in northeastern Minnesota is a 
100-mile string of mining towns about five miles apart from one another. The 
common link between these towns, which led to their development, was iron-ore 
mining. The color of bones found in the Mesabi Range is the color of leaching 
iron ore. Red. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting over coffee in a restaurant beneath his publisher's offices in 
Minneapolis, John Caddy explains, "What is perhaps confusing is that the Mesabi 
Range sits next to a mountain Range -- one of the oldest ranges in the east, 
some three billion years old. The mountain range is called the Giant's Range. 
Mesabi means 'sleeping giant,' and the name comes from the Ojibwa Indian tribe, 
natives of the region." 
</P>
<P>
There are no mountains along the Mesabi Range, only mining towns. It was in 
Hibbing where John Caddy was born. (The Zimmermans had a hardware store in 
Hibbing. Their son, Bob, who grew up with John Caddy, later changed his name to 
Bob Dylan.) 
</P>
<P>
Caddy is a third-generation native of the Mesabi Range, a descendant of 
hard-rock miners from Cornwall. His father was a mining engineer. Caddy's 
collection of poems is written from the experience of growing up in a tough 
family in, at times, a very tough community, and in a harsh region. There is a 
bittersweet appreciation for the place and the people of his youth that emerges 
from his work. 
</P>
<P>
There are poems and prose sketches about family: Grandma, Grandpa, a harsh 
father looked upon in terror as "the Giant" who beats his bewildered son. The 
boy perseveres. Perseverance comes naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Caddy's poems revolve about his community in the Mesabi. "Mining towns have 
always been either famine or . . . boom. Nothing in between. And when there's a 
boom there's often a strike, which means famine again. Economic fortunes are 
constantly ebbing," says Caddy reflectively. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of history is gleaned through reading the collection. Wobblies were 
members of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), a socialist movement 
strong in the mining communities and the lumbering communities that felled the 
forests before the miners stripped the land. (The derivation of the term 
Wobblie given to me by a bartender in Minnesota is that the Chinese who worked 
in lumbering and mining mumbled and mispronounced "workers of the world," 
transforming it into Wobblie.) 
</P>
<P>
The Ku Klux Klan was active in Minnesota during Caddy's youth. In his poem 
"Mine Town: Trick or Treat," Caddy writes of a young boy who secretly explores 
the forbidden drawers of his grandmother's dresser and discovers the white 
robes and hood of the Klan. The child ponders their purpose: "Sorcerer's robes, 
costumes for grownups, magic -- imagines them at the Halloween party. Exciting 
new pictures of Grandpa and Gram." When caught, he is admonished. The 
experience signifies nothing to the child, but recalled years later, it brings 
the stunning revelation of what the garments were. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most touching pieces in the book, "The Travel Collection," tells the 
story of a young boy who secretly collects free pamphlets through the mail from 
tourism offices. In his room, he pores over the brochures, dreaming of these 
places: "New Mexico, Land of Enchantment. Kachinas. Pueblos. Color. Space. 
Florida orange groves. Magic Tourist countries: Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad. The 
Caribbean. Lesser Antilles. Windwards. White sands, ocean blues, pale to azure 
to green." 
</P>
<P>
One day, while collecting on his paper route, the boy confesses to a woman that 
he has a hobby, a travel collection. She calls her aged husband to the door, 
exclaiming "the paperboy collects the same thing you do!" A toothless man in 
long johns and overalls, who must have lived his entire life in his house next 
to the mining foundry and pit, insists on showing the boy his collection. "He 
reads the headlines to the boy, sounding out the hard words: Barbados. Montana. 
Antigua. Tehuantepec. Kachinas. Land of Enchantment." 
</P>
<P>
"Children fascinate me," muses Caddy. "Their job is to survive, that's their 
only job. What they don't need to become self-aware about, they don't. You see 
in 'Mining Town: Trick of Treat!' it all means nothing to the child at the 
time. Then years later, bang! In the piece 'The Travel Collection,' the boy -- 
who in this case is me in my youth -- doesn't make anything of this old man. 
But look at the two." 
</P>
<P>
Caddy notes that most of the reviews of his new collection have stressed the 
violence of his book, and comments that he hopes the book has a greater range 
than that, which indeed it does. "One of my reasons for writing these poems was 
to explore why I don't hit my kids, as my father and his father did. How did 
that happen? Because these kinds of roles are passed on for generations. But as 
it developed, I got interested in how boys develop in that particular context 
and in those times. How do boys turn into halfway decent people?" 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who writes about family gets in trouble," Caddy reflects in closing. 
"My father just died this summer. I didn't feel comfortable publishing this 
book until it was discovered that my mother has Alzheimer's. The man in this 
book, my father, is a man in his late 20s and early 30s. God help us if we are 
all judged by who we are in our 20s and 30s, right? My father changed a lot. He 
was a good grandfather, just a horrible father." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how quickly the young boy who grew up collecting travel brochures 
got out of the mining regions of Minnesota, the author replies: "I left Mesabi 
right after high school. But in many ways I never left. What has always 
fascinated me about Mesabi is that it's surrounded by wilderness. I spent a lot 
of my childhood in those woods and that wilderness. I never left those woods, I 
left the towns."

THE CIVIL WAR NOTEBOOK OF DANIEL CHISHOLM, edited by W. Springer Menge and J. 
August Shimrak (Ballantine: $9.95). The recent PBS series has sparked a renewed 
interest in the Civil War, and these letters and diary entries by two soldiers 
in the Army of the Potomac reveal the wretched daily grind beneath the 
strategic maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
Like soldiers in any war, Daniel Chisholm and Samuel Clear were preoccupied 
with the tedious problems of daily survival: Mud, disease, weather, appalling 
food and the horrors of battle outweighed any ideological considerations. ("The 
rain is falling nearly all the time, our camp is very muddy . . . Nothing 
worthy of note today," reads Clear's entry for Jan. 9, 1865.) This grimly real 
view from the trenches balances out the dry-cleaned glamour of staged battle 
re-creations and popular novels.

TANGLED UP IN BLUE By Larry Duplechan (St. Martin's: $8.95). The well-rounded 
characters and agreeable style of Larry Duplechan's previous novel, 
"Blackbird," are sadly absent from this turgid potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
A lopsided romantic triangle involving a gay man, a heterosexual woman and her 
husband (who had an affair with the gay man but isn't really gay) unleashes 
numerous and predictable complications, which Duplechan recounts with the 
leaden superficiality of a bad soap opera. The story hits bottom around Page 
68, when the gay man is diagnosed as having AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) by a 
doctor who dismisses the idea of HIV testing and provides no medication or 
treatment. But that still leaves nearly 200 pages of stormy break-ups, tearful 
reconciliations and flaccid declarations of affection. Slogging through this 
bilge approaches an act of masochism, and few readers will care to subject 
themselves to it.

THE END OF NATURE By Bill McKibben (Anchor: $9.95). Bill McKibben argues that 
by altering the chemistry of the atmosphere with pollutants, humans have so 
profoundly changed the Earth that the natural world no longer exists: Every 
square inch of the planet has been irrevocably altered. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly but rationally, he reflects on the biological, environmental and 
psychological implications of his thesis. The greenhouse effect is causing the 
climate to change more quickly than it ever has in the past, and no one knows 
whether animals and plants (and humans) will be able to adapt to the rapidly 
rising temperatures, highly acidic rain and increased exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation. The most frightening aspect of this scenario is its irreversibility. 
The recently passed Clean Air Accord only slows the rate at which pollutants 
are added to the atmosphere. Even if the burning of fossil fuels ceased today, 
the climate would continue to warm and the ozone layer to deteriorate for 
decades (the chlorofluorocarbons already in the air will remain there for at 
least another century). Mankind has casually launched a juggernaut, and 
McKibben offers a warning of what will follow and an elegy for what has passed.

YOSEMITE: A LANDSCAPE OF LIFE, photographs by Jay Mather, text by Dale 
Maharidge, (The Yosemite Assn./The Sacramento Bee: $14.95). This handsome 
volume is being issued in conjunction with the centennial of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Maharidge's pleasant, readable essays describe the beauties and problems 
of Yosemite, especially the efforts to preserve some of its pristine glory, 
despite the presence of more than 3 million visitors each year. Maharidge takes 
an optimistic view, although it's debatable just how "wild" any area of the 
park remains. Jay Mather's splendid and occasionally vertiginous photographs 
complement the prose and vice versa, but the most inspiring section of the book 
focuses not on the beauties of the mountains and trees but on the courage of 
ranger Mark Wellman (pictured above), who, with the assistance of climber Mike 
Corbett, became the first paraplegic to scale the sheer granite face of El 
Capitan. Charles Solomon

In an interview for today's Parade magazine, Bo Jackson talked about growing up 
without his dad. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jackson: "My mom is my dad. She's the only mom and dad I know. Whenever 
she needs me, I don't care what I'm doing, I'm gonna drop it and go to her, 
'cause that's all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had enough food. But at least I could beat on other kids and steal 
their lunch money and buy myself something to eat. But I couldn't steal a 
father's hug when I needed one. I couldn't steal a father's whipping when I 
needed one." 
</P>
<P>
Bo-Derrick showdown: Jackson, who led the Kansas City Royals this season with 
28 home runs, returns to town as a Raider today. 
</P>
<P>
Bo and Chief linebacker Derrick Thomas, who played against each other when 
Jackson was at Auburn and Thomas was at Alabama, will face off again. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider-Chief game has been sold out for a month, and Thomas told Dick 
Brinster of the Associated Press: "The intensity (in Missouri) reminds me of 
the Alabama-Auburn rivalry when the whole state shuts down prior to the game. I 
get the same feeling I used to get just before the Alabama-Auburn game every 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Key figure: In his new book, "Pond Scum and Vultures," Times staff writer Gene 
Wojciechowski documents the often less-than-glamorous lifestyles of his 
sportswriting colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Wojciechowski tells the story of New York Times writer Michael Janofsky, who 
once worked for the Baltimore Evening Sun, where he covered several Oriole 
games. 
</P>
<P>
At a restaurant one evening, Janofsky spotted Oriole Manager Earl Weaver and 
his wife across the room. Both men finished eating at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Janofsky paid his check, walked outside and gave the valet his parking slip. 
Weaver and his wife soon came out. 
</P>
<P>
Wojciechowski writes: "Figuring this would be a nice time to reintroduce 
himself to Weaver, Janofsky moved toward the manager and extended his hand. 
Weaver looked at Janofsky, reached into his pocket, pulled out a ticket stub 
and said, 'It's the white Cadillac.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which NFL team holds the record for most overtime games in one 
regular season? 
</P>
<P>
Why?: From Associated Press: "New York Yankee manager Stump Merrill said Friday 
he would like to see George Steinbrenner get involved with running the club 
again some day." 
</P>
<P>
Man coverage: You remember McArthur towels, the company that contracted with 
NFL Properties to provide 2,100 terry-cloth robes and wraps for players, 
following the recent round of female-reporters-in-the-locker-room debates. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the company manufactured them in one size. Trouble is, one size doesn't 
fit all. 
</P>
<P>
Said Greg McArthur, the company's executive vice president: "The Green Bay 
Packers' equipment manager called and said the terry wrappers we sent weren't 
large enough to fit five of their 300-pound players." 
</P>
<P>
Or thereabouts. The Packer roster lists one 300-pounder, tackle Tony Mandarich, 
and five others at 285 or more.

never made it to the $1 million Arlington Challenge Cup, which had been billed 
as the race of the year, because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Classic Fame, Northern Wolf and Gorgeous also had their careers cut short by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first race, Mr. Nickerson died of an apparent heart attack. Shaker Knit 
fell over him, and was humanely destroyed that night. 
</P>
<P>
Two races later, heavily favored Go for Wand was leading Bayakoa by no more 
than a neck during the stretch of the Breeders' Cup Distaff when her right 
foreleg snapped and she fell. The filly tried to stand -- to the horror of more 
than 50,000 at the track and millions watching on national television. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear why so many famous racehorses have been hurt recently, but a 
survey of prominent racing people this week produced these theories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Longer seasons and more races than before. Instead of the good horses being 
taken out of training for the winter and brought back to the races leisurely 
each spring, they continue to race until something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thoroughbreds are bred for speed and competition. The good races provide 
the toughest tests. When the best race the best, as it was Saturday, they race 
their hardest until something gives. Go for Wand raced until she fell. That's 
the nature of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With more racing coverage than ever, more attention is given to the careers 
of the top horses. More horses are being bred. There are more than 50,000 
thoroughbreds foaled each year. Thirty years ago, there were about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hard tracks. Some people believe that some track superintendents are 
inclined to speed up their tracks when important races are coming up. When the 
speeded-up condition exists -- the tracks are harder because there is less 
cushion -- the fragile legs of racehorses can give way. 
</P>
<P>
Seth Hancock, who runs Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., agreed with several of the 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there's more injuries this year," he said. "There's so many more 
horses at so many more tracks. There used to be 5,000 horses born each year, 
and there was very little winter racing. It used to be that horses rested in 
South Carolina. They don't rest now. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's the competition. Sunday Silence and Easy Goer raced four times 
last year. Their trainers knew they had to be at their best to race, and they 
were honed to the finest edge. Something has to give sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Harthill, a nationally known veterinarian, said: "They run all year. 
Around the racetrack, people say there's two kinds of racehorses. One has 
problems, and the other will have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Said trainer Shug McGaughey: "This (all the attention) is just because they are 
name horses. No one pays any attention to a horse trained by a friend of mine 
that got hurt in an earlier race that day and had to be operated on to be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
"These are a matter of good horses taking bad steps and getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Or does the horse of McGaughey's friend merely add to the puzzle? 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Vallance, a veterinarian who practices on the Maryland circuit, says 
the extreme speed and the horses' natural desire to run fast cause the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget a trip I took to the Bahamas in the 1970s," he said. "I was 
in Nassau at the Hobby Horse track. The horses were native-bred and weren't 
thoroughbreds. But they didn't have any injuries. They were mostly all sound. 
</P>
<P>
"But the point is, they weren't fast either. They went six furlongs in 1:20." 
</P>
<P>
Fast thoroughbreds at good tracks in the United States race six furlongs in 
about 1 minute, 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Hank Allen said he didn't think the rash of injuries at Belmont was 
coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
"Northern Wolf had never taken a bad step in his life until the day (at 
Belmont) he worked so fast," Allen said. "The track was extremely fast. There 
have been several other horses, not in the Breeders' Cup races, that were 
injured up there. It seems to me that tracks in many places get faster the 
closer the time comes for a big race. That's not to say the tracks 
(managements) aren't trying to do their best. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know I've had awfully bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Joe King, superintendent of the tracks run by the New York Racing Association, 
of which Belmont Park is one, said: "There's no reason (for speeding up 
tracks). Our goal is uniformity and consistency. Nothing was changed for 
Breeders' Cup week." 
</P>
<P>
King did point out that faster times usually are produced by the better horses, 
"and they run on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
An employee of the NYRA checks the depth of the cushion each racing day at 
about 120 places on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no difference last week," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Zipf, chief veterinarian representing the Maryland Racing Commission, 
said he has not seen an unusually large number of injuries in Maryland this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the same or maybe a little less this year," he said. "Generally, we 
have 20-25 horses injured in races each year that have to be put down. I 
haven't counted them for 1990, but I think it's no more than 25. And that 
includes a larger-than-usual number this summer at Timonium. No big number in 
Maryland."

<P>
West Virginia outgained Penn State, but the Nittany Lions still continued their 
dominance over the Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
With reserve quarterback Tom Bill passing for one touchdown and running for 
another, No. 24 Penn State defeated West Virginia, 31-19, Saturday at 
Morgantown, W.Va., to give Penn State Coach Joe Paterno his 23rd victory in 25 
games against the Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia (3-5) outrushed Penn State, 176-134, outpassed the Nittany Lions, 
153-112, and controlled the ball for three more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Penn State (6-2) intercepted three passes and got a solid performance from 
Bill, who came off the bench last week and lifted Penn State to a 9-0 victory 
over Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Bill replaced Tony Sacca with 6:42 left in the second quarter and Penn State 
leading, 7-3. Bill had been the Penn State starter before withdrawing from 
school to enter an alcohol treatment program. He returned to Penn State this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't get unwound and I thought we ought to try something," Paterno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill completed seven of 12 passes for 99 yards, including a nine-yard touchdown 
pass to Terrence Smith. Bill, who also scored on a five-yard run, came into the 
game after Sacca threw a pass into the hands of defender Kwamee Smith, who 
dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 35, Boston College 6 -- Freshman quarterback Marvin Graves connected 
with Rob Carpenter on a 61-yard touchdown pass play and set up another 
touchdown with a 57-yard run to lead the Orangemen (5-2-2) over the Eagles 
(4-4) in a nonconference game at Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen padded a 21-6 halftime lead with two touchdowns -- both following 
interceptions -- on the first four offensive plays of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Army 35, Rutgers 31 -- Willie McMillian scored a touchdown on a four-yard run 
with 43 seconds left to lift the Cadets (4-4) over the Scarlet Knights (3-6) at 
West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Army's Mike Mayweather rushed for 134 yards in 25 carries and scored on a 
three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Callian Thomas had 111 yards in 15 carries for the Cadets. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell 41, Yale 31 -- Cornell's Scott Oliaro set an Ivy League record with 395 
all-purpose yards as the Big Red (5-3, 4-1) defeated the Elis (4-4, 3-2) at New 
Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Oliaro, who rushed for 288 yards in 35 carries and scored four touchdowns, 
eclipsed the mark of 281 yards set by Ed Marinaro against Harvard in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 52, Brown 37 -- The Crimson (5-3, 3-2) went on its biggest scoring 
spree since 1973 to beat the Bears (1-7, 1-4) in an Ivy League game at 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth 34, Columbia 20 -- Al Rosier rushed for 145 yards to lead the Big 
Green (5-2-1, 4-1) to an Ivy League victory over the Lions (1-7, 1-4) at 
Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton 34, Pennsylvania 20 -- Erick Hamilton rushed for 122 yards and three 
touchdowns to lead the Tigers (3-5, 2-3) over the Quakers (2-6, 2-3) in an Ivy

PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MCCAFFREY HAS FOUR TOUCHDOWNS FOR STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed McCaffrey made sure he will have plenty of fond memories of his final game 
at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's wide receiver caught three touchdown passes and ran for another 
score to lead the Cardinal to a 31-13 Pacific 10 Conference victory over 
Washington State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In winning its final home game of the season, Stanford, 3-6 and 2-4 in the 
conference, held Washington State (3-6, 2-4) to 183 total yards and looked 
nothing like the team that was shut out, 31-0, at Oregon last week. 
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey looked like the conference's premier receiver. In compiling 176 
receiving yards, he needs only 161 yards in his final two games to become 
Stanford's all-time leading receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very emotional for me to be playing my last game here and I wanted to 
go out with a win," said McCaffrey, who caught touchdown passes of 69, 34 and 
31 yards and scored on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the way I wanted to go out. I savored every minute of it." The 
Cardinal offense racked up 500 yards in total offense to end a three-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey caught seven passes for a career-high 176 yards, the fourth-highest 
total in Stanford history. His four touchdowns were also a single-game career 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed just played a super game," said Stanford quarterback Jason Palumbis, who 
completed 23 of 30 passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns. "He's a great 
receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe completed only eight of 26 passes for 
64 yards before being replaced by Aaron Garcia late in the game. The Cougars 
netted 81 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
After Washington State took a 10-0 lead on a 42-yard field goal by Jason Hanson 
and a two-yard run by Paul Carr, the disappointments began for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford scored 17 consecutive points in the final nine minutes of the second 
quarter to take a 17-10 lead. In the third quarter, Stanford increased its lead 
to 24-10 when Palumbis threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:53 left in the quarter, Palumbis and McCaffrey teamed up again, this 
time for a 31-yard touchdown and Stanford led, 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 34, Oregon State 9 -- Kelvin Fisher rushed for 121 yards and two 
touchdowns in 18 carries and safety Nathan LaDuke returned one of his two 
interceptions a school-record 95 yards for another score as the Sun Devils 
ended a five-game losing streak by beating the Beavers at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils (3-5, 1-4) avoided tying the school record for most consecutive 
losses, six, set in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (1-8, 1-4) was held to Jamie Burke's three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State led 10-6 at halftime on Paul Justin's 10-yard touchdown pass to 
Eric Guliford with 6:35 left and Steve Rausch's 50-yard field goal as time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Brett Wallerstedt's interception at the Oregon State 37 set up the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Richey's 23-yard field goal made it 13-6 with 8:03 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher scored on a 16-yard run 36 seconds later, one play after LaDuke's 
interception and 26-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
LaDuke's 95-yard return with 5:32 remaining in the game broke the previous 
school record of 93 yards, set in 1985 by Jeff Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Justin, in his second game back since suffering a separated left shoulder Sept. 
29, completed 10 of 22 passes for 97 yards with one interception.

<P>
BIG TEN: HAWKEYES ROUT NO. 5 ILLINOIS, 54-28, AND NEED TO WIN TWO OF THEIR LAST 
THREE FOR A BERTH IN THE ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has the Big Ten finally produced a team capable of blocking out the 
distractions and focusing on football New Year's Day in Pasadena? 
</P>
<P>
Stop snickering and consider the 1990 Iowa Hawkeyes, who Saturday moved into 
position to be the Big Ten's Rose Bowl representative with their third major 
upset on the road this season -- a 54-28 victory over fifth-ranked Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
If the 13th-ranked Hawkeyes win two of their last three games (against Ohio 
State and Purdue at home and Minnesota on the road), they will play in the Rose 
Bowl for the first time since 1986, when they were beaten by UCLA, 45-28. 
</P>
<P>
And if they can keep up the concentration that has carried them to road 
victories this season at Michigan State, Michigan and Illinois, the Hawkeyes, 
7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Big Ten, might actually leave California with 
something other than souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa stepped into a particularly hostile environment Saturday -- 72,714 in 
Illinois' Memorial Stadium energized by speculation that the NCAA's 
investigation of the Illini basketball program, sparked by an Iowa assistant 
coach, could bring penalties some time this week. Iowa players woke up Saturday 
to a front-page headline in the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette reading, "Bad 
Blood Boiling Over Illini-Hawkeye 'Game of the Year.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the Hawkeyes took the crowd out of the game by rushing out to a 28-0 lead 
and never looking back to win here for the first time since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Bell, Iowa's 255-pound tailback, gained 168 yards in 22 carries and scored 
two touchdowns. His backup, Tony Stewart, ran for 101 yards in 22 carries and 
threw a three-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes gained 540 yards in offense against the top-rated defense in the 
Big Ten. More telling is the fact that Iowa produced 297 yards -- 145 from Bell 
in 16 carries -- and held a 34-14 lead at halftime against a defensive unit 
that had allowed only one touchdown in 15 quarters coming into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I never in my wildest dreams thought our offense could go out against a great 
defensive team like Illinois and just chop them up," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois' senior defensive stars, nose tackle Moe Gardner and tackle Mel Agee, 
were nonfactors as the Iowa offensive line opened huge holes for Bell and 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 6-2 overall and 4-1 in the Big Ten, started the game on an upbeat 
note, with Clinton Lynch returning the opening kickoff 37 yards. After Jason 
Verduzco threw nine yards to Shawn Wax, the Illini had second and one at their 
own 46-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
But then the sky fell on them in the person of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner Lester fumbled the ball away, allowing the Hawkeyes to take possession 
at their own 49, and Bell broke a 43-yard run on the first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Iowa was in the end zone, quarterback Matt Rodgers throwing 
five yards to wingback Mike Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes quickly got the ball back after the next Illinois series went 
one-two-three punt, and they rode the running of Bell and Stewart 64 yards to 
another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fry went deep into his playbook on the scoring play -- Stewart's halfback pass 
to Danan Hughes -- catching Illinois free safety Marlon Primous moving up to 
force the run. 
</P>
<P>
"A good time for that," Stewart said. "Coach Fry made a good call. Some people 
thought I was going to overthrow Danan, he was so wide open." 
</P>
<P>
Fory Wells was forced to punt from the end zone on the Illini's next series, 
allowing Iowa to regain possession at the Illinois 43. This time, it took the 
Hawkeyes only four snaps to score, with Bell rushing the final 26 yards. The 
senior from Las Vegas made a quick cut at the line of scrimmage and ran through 
linebacker Romero Brice to break free. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick and Tony get the extra yard for us," Iowa center Mike Devlin said later. 
"That helps a lot. We open up a hole for them, and they get 10, 15 yards more 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Said Illinois Coach John Mackovic: "They were going to run the ball, run it 
right at us, and see if we could hold up. And we did not. Because of that, it 
gave them great confidence." 
</P>
<P>
When the Illinois offense again went nowhere, Iowa took over and went on a 
67-yard, 11-play scoring drive to take a 28-0 lead 4:51 into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the big deficit, the Illinois offense meshed for the first time all 
day, scoring on Verduzco's 20-yard pass to Wax. 
</P>
<P>
But the momentum remained with Iowa, thanks to another unconventional call by 
Fry. 
</P>
<P>
With the Hawkeyes lined up in field-goal position on fourth and four at the 
Illinois 14, holder Jim Hartleib, Iowa's backup quarterback, took the snap, 
sprinted right and threw to tight end Matt Whitaker for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois scored again on Verduzco's two-yard pass to Lester to narrow Iowa's 
lead to 35-14 at the half. But the Hawkeyes scored nine more points to take a 
30-point lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That was far too much for Illinois to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa was ready," Mackovic said, "they took advantage of every single 
possibility. They forced turnovers. They ran the ball hard right at us. They 
passed the ball. They picked up the blitzes when we tried (to blitz). They 
really didn't give us much of a chance to get started."

Ohio State tuned up for next Saturday's Big Ten showdown against No. 13 Iowa by 
routing Northwestern, 48-7, Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our squad to enjoy this victory tonight," Ohio State Coach John Cooper 
said, "because starting tomorrow afternoon everything will be about Iowa. We 
probably won't even look at this film tomorrow. . . . Maybe we ought to start 
working on (Iowa) tonight, as good as they are." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes will play the Hawkeyes at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State was never threatened against the Wildcats, scoring on its first six 
possessions. Raymont Harris scored two touchdowns and Kent Graham came on to 
throw a pair of touchdown passes as the Wildcats were assured of their 19th 
consecutive losing season. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about the ballgame was that we won handily, we played a lot of 
players and didn't have any serious injuries," said Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Frey sustained bruised ribs during a third-quarter sack, but Cooper said 
he expected his senior quarterback to be available for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State improved to 5-2-1 overall and 3-1-1 in the Big Ten by winning its 
third game in a row. Northwestern is 2-6 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith rushed for 128 yards in 23 attempts for the Buckeyes, who built a 
27-7 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Michigan 38, Purdue 13 -- Allen Jefferson scored three touchdowns on 
short runs, but it was the Wolverines' special teams that did the most damage 
in this Big Ten game at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Ware scored once on a blocked punt and recovered a fumbled kickoff to 
set up another score for the Wolverines (5-3, 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said and every coach will tell you, you can't overemphasize the 
importance of special teams," said Michigan Coach Gary Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's Fred Akers, whose team dropped to 1-7 and 0-5, said: "Mistakes in the 
kicking game in the first half usually are disastrous. Those really were." 
</P>
<P>
Ware went 17 yards after Dave Ritter's block and recovered a fumble of the 
ensuing kickoff that set up a 16-yard touchdown pass play from Elvis Grbac to 
Desmond Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson, who carried the ball only six times for 24 yards, scored on runs of 
two and three yards and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, who intercepted two Eric Hunter passes in the first half, led 
31-6 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 45, Indiana 20 -- Hyland Hickson ran for 170 yards and scored 
three second-half touchdowns as the Spartans overcame a shaky first half and 
beat the Hoosiers in a Big Ten game at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Tico Duckett ran for 150 yards and a touchdown for Michigan State (4-3-1, 3-2), 
and quarterback Dan Enos added two short touchdown runs. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (4-3-1, 1-3-1) took advantage of Michigan State turnovers to lead, 
20-17, at halftime. But it was Indiana's turn to blunder in the third quarter. 
Ernie Thompson fumbled at the Hoosier 46 and the Spartans were in the end zone 
seven plays later, with Hickson scoring from 13 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Hickson then capped a 64-yard drive with an eight-yard run to put Michigan 
State ahead 31-20. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by Indiana's Vaughn Dunbar was recovered by linebacker Dixon Edwards 
at the Indiana 39, and Michigan State scored four plays later on a 15-yard run 
by Duckett to lead 38-20. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's last serious comeback bid ended when, after driving 53 yards to the 
Michigan State 27, Thompson was thrown for a two-yard loss on fourth and one. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 21, Wisconsin 3 -- Tailback Mark Smith scored two touchdowns and 
Chuck Rios added a third and the Gophers held the Badgers to 36 yards rushing 
at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
The victory keeps Minnesota's Big Ten championship hopes alive. The Gophers are 
5-3 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a freshman, rushed for 73 yards in 20 carries and scored on a four-yard 
run in the first quarter and on a 16-yard shuffle pass from Scott Schaffner in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin is 1-7, 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
This was the 100th meeting between these two schools. Minnesota leads the 
series, 55-37-8.

BACKCOURT STEERS CELTICS TOWARD FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boston Celtics fans should have spent their summer thinking of Brian Shaw and 
Dee Brown in uniform, on the fly, darting about on the Boston Garden parquet. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, fans pictured Shaw in federal court, fighting to nullify his Celtics 
contract and return to Italy. They pictured Brown face down on a street in 
affluent Wellesley, Mass., surrounded by police officers, wrongly accused of 
being a bank robber. 
</P>
<P>
Would the off-season events sour Celtics fans on Shaw and-or sour Brown on 
Boston? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Shaw is winning over fans. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is living happily in Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
And on the eve of the regular season -- the Celtics open at home against the 
Cleveland Cavaliers Friday night -- it appears things have worked out for 
Celtics fans. In fact, there is a refreshing feeling in Beantown about 
basketball in general, and about the backcourt in particular. 
</P>
<P>
After a year in the minors and an eventful summer in court, Shaw is playing at 
a higher level than he did his rookie year, when he averaged 5.7 assists and 
8.6 points on 43 percent shooting. And the touted Brown, the Celtics' 
first-round pick (19th overall) out of Jacksonville University, has done 
nothing to disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
These are two quick, exciting players. Two players the Celtics have needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that Brian Shaw and Dee Brown are leaders, and I expect them to step 
forward," Celtics Coach Chris Ford said. "They breathe fire and life into the 
older guys." 
</P>
<P>
Ford is banking on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten quicker and more athletic in the perimeter positions so that 
we'll be able to do things other than banging away at half-court," Celtics 
basketball operations chief Dave Gavitt said. "Chris is committed to this." 
</P>
<P>
When camp opened Oct. 5, Dennis Johnson, 36, the Celtics' point guard through 
seven mostly glorious years, was gone. So was guard Jim Paxson, 33. Guard John 
Bagley, 30, was suffering from tendinitis of the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, in his first year as Celtics coach, moved quickly to strip away Boston's 
tired half-court offense. He began work on increasing the tempo, improving 
transition defense and establishing that Shaw and Brown are the ones who will 
make the new system go. 
</P>
<P>
Ford gave Shaw the ball and said, "I have confidence in you. Run the show." 
</P>
<P>
In his first game as a Celtic since returning from Il Messaggero-Roma, Shaw had 
12 points and nine assists; he turned Hartford, Conn., boos to cheers after 
only two trips down the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Boston was supposed to be a tougher test. Last week, in the Celtics' only 
preseason game at the Garden, Shaw was again greeted with boos. One dive into 
the stands after a loose ball changed all that. Shaw finished that game with 22 
points, 11 assists, six rebounds and a heap of support. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it's all over. It's just basketball now," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw has been nothing but confident. He averaged 13.3 points on 50 percent 
shooting and made 64 assists in eight exhibition games. Off the court, Shaw has 
faced the media in every city with his chin up, answering difficult questions 
articulately and with class. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when Coach Ford was an assistant when I was here a couple years ago, he 
always pushed me to push the ball up, play tough defense and instill a 
leadership factor," Shaw said. "When I'm out there I have to be a leader. He's 
put a lot of time and effort in, given me a lot of responsibility, and I hope 
to respond in a way to reward him for the confidence he has had in me." 
</P>
<P>
Ford is high on Brown for many of the same reasons he likes Shaw. Brown shows 
the same intelligence and leadership skills as Shaw. Brown is athletic, among 
the quickest players in the league and loves to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
But before he could display any of these attributes, Brown had to deal with a 
highly publicized off-court incident. Said Atlanta Hawks guard Doc Rivers, "I 
didn't know who Dee Brown was until I heard he couldn't buy a house in 
Wellesley." 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, Brown didn't want to buy a house in Wellesley, a wealthy Boston 
suburb, after he was wrongly accosted by police there in August. There was an 
uproar over the incident -- many accused Wellesley authorities of being 
racially biased. Since, Brown, who is black, has become something of a 
spokesman for the wrongly accused, smoothed over his differences with the 
authorities, received a ton of support mail and bought a house. In Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
Celtics fans have quickly taken to Brown. He's fun. At one moment, Brown might 
explode by Spud Webb for a dunk; he did that against the ultra-quick Hawks 
guard in a Worcester exhibition two weeks ago. Another moment, Brown might be 
flying out of bounds to save a ball with a behind-the-head heave; he did that 
last week in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Brown's exuberance. The facial expressions. The freshness he 
brings to the team, on and off the court. Just listen .. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to high school and college in Jacksonville," Brown said, "so this is 
the first time I've really been away from home. So I talk to my mom and dad 
about once a week. You've always got to talk to your parents, to see what's 
going on back home, to get that little boost. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad's only 40, he's young. When I talk to him, it's almost like talking to 
a brother and a friend to a certain extent, man-to-man. He keeps my head 
straight. He tells me, 'Hey, it doesn't end right here. You've still got to get 
to a level where guys like (Kevin) McHale and (Robert) Parish are. Then you 
still can't stop.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a long way to go, I know that. As long as I think of it like that, I 
can keep improving and I can stay in the league for a while." 
</P>
<P>
And as Brown improves, and Shaw, so will the Celtics.

SAN JOSE STAYS IN FIRST, DEFEATS FULLERTON, 44-6

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With San Jose State's 44-6 victory over Cal State Fullerton Saturday night, the 
Spartans appear well on their way to a Nov. 17 showdown against Fresno State to 
determine the Big West Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, the Titans (1-9) may be involved in another showdown of sorts -- 
a game against New Mexico State to determine the worst Division I-A football 
team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which lost its ninth in a row, is ranked 105th out of 106 Division 
I-A teams by The National, an all-sports publication. New Mexico State is 
106th. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State will be a big underdog against San Jose State next week. Ditto 
for the Titans against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Barring any upsets, Fullerton will play New Mexico State in Las Cruces Nov. 17 
-- for none of the marbles. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good coach, Fullerton's Gene Murphy refuses to look ahead to a 
possible un-championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk about New Mexico State next week," he said. "We're looking forward 
to playing Utah State." 
</P>
<P>
That sure beats looking back at Saturday night's game. The Titans were 
manhandled by a far-superior San Jose State team, which improved to 6-2-1, 5-0 
in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, behind the passing of Ralph Martini and the running of Sheldon 
Canley, had 670 total yards, including 473 in the first half, when they took a 
37-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Martini, with plenty of protection and so many wide-open receivers he probably 
had trouble deciding who to throw to, completed 29 of 39 passes for 443 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Canley, a tailback who leads the nation in all-purpose yards, carried 21 times 
for 123 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught six passes for 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
David Blakes caught seven passes for 95 yards, and Bobby Blackmon caught four 
passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Pass defense has definitely not been our strong suit this season," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State put the game away in the first half by scoring on six of nine 
possessions. Twenty first-half plays went for 10 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans finished with 29 first downs, compared to Fullerton's 13, and 504 
yards passing.

NEDERLANDER: KINDER, GENTLER YANKEE BOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since becoming the New York Yankees' general partner, Robert 
Nederlander met with the media Wednesday. He sounded like a man who had watched 
and witnessed and charted George Steinbrenner's 17-plus seasons and who had 
decided to do everything the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander must have heard those "George Must Go" chants. 
</P>
<P>
In the relaxed one-hour session also attended by General Manager Gene Michael 
and Assistant General Manager Bill Bergesch, Nederlander frequently used the 
phrase "fiscally responsible," which may mean they'll never even bid for Mr. 
Jose Canseco Numbers -- Darryl Strawberry. Nederlander also said he likes 
stability and vows to give young players ample opportunity. High on his no-no 
list is second-guessing baseball executives. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, no George II. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to comment on what he did before -- after all, he did win more 
games than anyone in the '80s," Nederlander said. "Let me just say he did 
things the way he saw fit. And I'll do them the way I see fit. Who's to say 
what's right?" 
</P>
<P>
Right away, the media gatherings are different. Steinbrenner definitely ran 
those shows. At his last press gathering-luncheon, before the 1990 season, 
Steinbrenner spoke often. When General Manager Pete Peterson or Manager Bucky 
Dent spoke, it was because Steinbrenner requested it. 
</P>
<P>
This Nederlander production was decidedly low-key. Nederlander often deferred 
questions to Michael, almost as if he were an equal. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an excellent baseball team here," Nederlander said, referring not to 
his last-place club but to his team of executives. "I'm going to rely heavily 
on their advice. I informed them that I won't be second-guessing them. Everyone 
makes mistakes. Of course, I hope we don't make too many." 
</P>
<P>
That should not be construed as a threat. Unlike Steinbrenner's now-infamous 
pre-1990 gathering at which he proclaimed Dent would manage the entire season, 
Nederlander made no headline-grabbing statements. 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to repeat Steinbrenner's mistake, Nederlander said only, "I 
don't look to fire anybody at this point. We have good people who have only 
been there a few months. You have to give people time to prove themselves. Our 
baseball people are high on (Stump Merrill). I'm sure he's going to be around 
awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander has spent most of his 57 years in the theater business, though it 
wasn't manifested Wednesday -- there were no theatrics. "Saturday Night Live" 
is unlikely to make his resume. 
</P>
<P>
On one point he did offer a nice monologue. Asked about the perception he is 
more theater man than baseball man, Nederlander responded, "It's the 
entertainment business. I've been in the entertainment business my whole life. 
I've been around stars, whether it be Phil Silvers or whomever. I understand 
stars. Baseball players are stars." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not all of them, which is why the Yankees went 67-95. 
</P>
<P>
While Nederlander said big stars deserve big money, he also said the front 
office hasn't discussed the possibility of courting Strawberry, the home run 
ball in this year's free-agent crop (though, strangely, Michael volunteered 
that Strawberry's name came up in a conversation on another matter between 
Bergesch and agent Eric Goldschmidt). Instead, the Yankees have concentrated on 
their top priorities, third basemen and starting pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even gotten to Mr. Strawberry yet," Nederlander said. 
</P>
<P>
That, apparently, is the strategy. The Yankees do not deny interest in the 
crosstown megastar, with Michael conceding, "We know he's a player and we're 
going to have to assess it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael also said, however, that before they jump in, "We want to see figures 
in the paper ... We want to know how much it's going to take." 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically about Strawberry, Nederlander chose to talk generally about 
escalating salaries. Another chance, another lost headline. 
</P>
<P>
Michael was more outspoken. In direct contrast to the Yankees' past 
free-spending, first-bid style, Michael said, "We don't want to be the first 
ones in. In the past we drove prices up, and we're not going to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to Pascual Perez, a $5.7 million lesson. "We will try to look 
at the health a little more," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
So among free-agent pitchers, the injury-plagued Ted Higuera and Danny Jackson 
may be somewhat less desirable than Mike Boddicker, Bob Welch, Tom Browning and 
even Bud Black. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, their own free-agent pitchers, Dave Righetti and Tim Leary, still 
interest them. Though neither seems particularly close to re-signing, Michael 
-- who met Wednesday with Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein -- said, "I think we 
could sign them both but we might be a little ahead with Righetti." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Michael and Nederlander insist that young players are the Yankees' 
future. "Teams have to rely on young players for stability," Nederlander said. 
Michael even said he is counting on Hensley Meulens as the starting left 
fielder and Dave Eiland as one-fifth of the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as his own future is concerned, Nederlander said he is nobody's 
caretaker. Not George Steinbrenner's, not Hal Steinbrenner's, not anybody's. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came in, I came in with no conditions to leave at any point," 
Nederlander said. "I'm 57. I will be here for some time. As to how long, that 
will depend on how long I want to do it and how the other partners feel I'm 
doing."

SAN DIEGO STATE ROLLS UP SIXES AND A WIN, 66-14;

AZTECS: POINT TOTAL AGAINST UTAH IS BIGGEST SINCE 1968. MCGWIRE PASSES FOR FOUR

A well-rested San Diego State turned three weeks worth of frustration into 60 
minutes of fury Saturday night in a 66-14 Western Athletic Conference rout of 
Utah before a homecoming crowd of 25,504 at Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State had not played a game since Oct. 13 and not one at home since 
Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
And no one, including their coach, knew how the Aztecs, 3-4 overall and 2-2 in 
the conference, would react to nothing but three weeks of practice in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs answered in the affirmative. The 66 points were the most for the 
Aztecs since they defeated Southern Mississippi, 68-7, in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire moved into second place on the San Diego State career 
passing list, completing 22 of 33 passes for 286 yards and four touchdowns 
before getting a chance to rest almost the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire moved ahead of Brian Sipe, who finished with 5,707 yards, when he 
completed a 35-yard pass to Dennis Arey two minutes into the second quarter. 
McGwire's 5,858 yards trail only Todd Santos, but by a lot. Santos had 11,425 
yards, the NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
But second-place all-time at SDSU isn't bad for someone who hasn't even 
completed his second full season. The Utah game was his 19th at SDSU after 
transferring from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
With still about 11 minutes to play in the second quarter, this is what McGwire 
had accomplished: 13 completions in 15 attempts for 181 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs outscored the Utes 28-0 in the second quarter and led 42-7 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Rowe and Arey each caught two touchdown passes. Rowe, who came into the 
game leading the nation in receiving with a 120.5-yard average, had seven 
catches for 120 yards as he passed the 100-yard mark for the fifth straight 
game. Arey also caught seven passes for 102 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Utah (3-6, 1-5) lost for the sixth time in its last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Utah's Jason Woods completed 10 of 25 passes for 147 yards. His only touchdown 
pass came late in the third quarter on a 13-yard throw to Mike Anglesey. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State became the last Division I-A team to intercept a pass as Johnny 
Walker intercepted Woods twice in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State scored 24 points in the fourth quarter.

SONICS NEED TO FIT FIVE NOT-SO-EASY PIECES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KAHN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SEATTLE

<TEXT>
<P>
The package has some interesting wrapping: style and grace, power and speed. It 
comes with a depth of skill that is comparable from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
These are the components of the 1990-91 Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
If it all fits, this will be one interesting NBA season and the Sonics could 
surprise people with their young talent and versatility. But if this wrapping 
doesn't stick together with new coach K.C. Jones' tranquil manner, the whole 
package will fall apart and they won't make the playoffs for the second year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
"The old saying of success is it's all based on symmetry," Jones said. "The sum 
of the individuals make it all come together. That's what it's all about, but 
it's hard to get. It creates a stability that Detroit, the Lakers and the 
Celtics have. That's what we're aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to get an exact read on the future of this young team. For the 
Sonics to make the playoffs as a considerably improved team over the erratic 
one of a year ago, there are five not-so-easy pieces that must mesh. And those 
pieces must nurture under the understated style of Jones as opposed to the 
fiery coaching of Bernie Bickerstaff last season. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall chemistry will come, but only if they have a belief in what K.C. 
is trying to accomplish," Sonics president Bob Whitsitt said. "He's different 
and he's giving the players room to play the game. They have to be able to 
handle that while learning a new system." 
</P>
<P>
And if that component isn't accepted, the following five pieces will fade into 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
1. The new kid: The team must grow with rookie Gary Payton as the floor leader. 
Not only physically, as the guy who brings the ball up the floor and sets up 
the plays, but as the emotional charge, with the latitude to arrange the 
players on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate key is Gary," Jones said. "We needed a floor leader and we got 
him. He's shown flashes of what he'll be -- the same presence as Magic 
controlling the show. He puts it together for us driving the stagecoach. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has to rush the ball up the floor with consistency and purpose. It's 
a sense of timing and feel. That's what we got Gary for. It's up to him to 
jump-start the offense every night, and the rest of the guys should just fall 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
2. A two-headed center: Olden Polynice must earn at least 20 minutes a game at 
center, splitting time with Michael Cage in the middle. The two should average 
between 16-20 points and 16-20 rebounds every night. That is the only way the 
team will compensate for not having a dominant, low-post center. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to throw Olden in there as a key," Whitsitt said. "He hasn't played a 
lot of minutes his first three years and this year he's going to get the 
chance. He's still a young guy with talent. We have to see if he can do the 
same thing for most of a regular season that he's done at the end of seasons 
and during exhibition games." 
</P>
<P>
And Cage has to be able to handle decreased minutes. He played less than 32 
minutes a game last season and isn't likely to get that much this season. He 
hits the open jumpers from the wing and crashes the offensive boards. Polynice 
is more of a low-post guy who rebounds and applies pressure in the trapping 
defense perhaps better than any other 7-footer in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"They're different so we need them both to be great at what they do best every 
night," Jones said. "Obviously Olden has to get more minutes than last year 
(13.7) and Michael needs minutes too. They are a perfect example of playing the 
team concept of making each other look better." 
</P>
<P>
3. The two who would be stars: More Shawn Kemp than Dana Barros, but the two 
1989 first-round draft choices need to be consistent impact players this 
season. Not just the once-every-two-weeks big games, but Kemp must be a nightly 
factor blocking shots and rebounding, and Barros needs to average double 
figures off the bench with 100 three-point goals. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to believe the upside on those guys is very good," Whitsitt said. "We 
just don't know when that will be." 
</P>
<P>
Barros was saddled with ankle and thigh injuries during the exhibition season 
and never really had a chance to show how much he has improved his ballhandling 
skills during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, who won't be 21 until the end of this month, is a different story. His 
defense and rebounding have been excellent, but put his hands on the ball, and, 
well, he has been as unpredictable. That could be expected from a guy who never 
played college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got great stuff on the defensive end already and that's the way I'd 
prefer it," Jones said. "It's hard work and desire he has with great talent. 
He's got to work on the offensive end to get better. Work hard to have a better 
outside jump shot and moves to the basket. It will all come." 
</P>
<P>
When? 
</P>
<P>
4. The Mac Attack: It's hard to figure what will happen with Nate McMillan and 
Xavier McDaniel. The two have been traded seemingly every week, but no deals 
have been consummated. They're looking over their shoulders, and have played 
fairly well in exhibition games despite the distractions. 
</P>
<P>
McMillan, despite an ankle sprain, has accepted his bench role at small forward 
with open arms. McDaniel is playing as hard as ever, but stewing over his 
status. As long as Kemp is still in the learning stage, he's OK, but when Kemp 
is ready for major minutes, a decision has to be made. 
</P>
<P>
And the biggest Mac, 6-10 Derrick McKey, has gotten his weight up to 230. But 
are they still forcing it by putting him at power forward? He's a finesse 
player, and it's a push for him to match up with the brutes up front. Even if 
he does get the ball out on the floor more this season, he's still rebounding 
against Buck Williams and Karl Malone instead of Jerome Kersey and Blue 
Edwards. He's suffered through torn muscle fibers in his thigh, a sprained 
ankle and a badly jammed thumb, and the season hasn't even started yet. 
</P>
<P>
5. The Ellis Illusion: For now, Dale Ellis isn't playing because he's got 
tarsal tunnel syndrome in his right foot, a mysterious affliction that causes 
varying degrees of numbness. Last season, he missed 27 games because he broke 
three ribs in a car accident. He was distracted and out of shape through much 
of training camp because of the subsequent trial that convicted him of drunken 
and reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team has at least one player who has problems off the floor," Whitsitt 
said. "The bottom line is how they do on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is counting on a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"He and X (McDaniel) are our scorers," Jones said. "For us to have a smooth 
sailing ship, they've got to get their shots and points. 
</P>
<P>
"No one carries this team. The team carries everyone."

THOROUGHBRED INDUSTRY DYING IN 2 STATES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Martin does not waver. His voice is steady, staid. He is not trying to 
tell a joke -- he is trying to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
There might be a tinge of humor in this tale, but few in Colorado are laughing. 
Martin, the president of the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn., 
certainly is not. 
</P>
<P>
The thoroughbred industry in Colorado is in serious trouble, closer to 
extinction than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"One horseman gave me the best example. He comes to me, tells me, 'Some guy 
just tried to sell me a horse.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking that's great, what's wrong with that? And he said to me, 'Hell, 
three or four guys have tried to GIVE me their horses.' 
</P>
<P>
"A Colorado-bred isn't worth five cents," Martin said. "A breeder selling a 
horse can't even make his registration fees back." 
</P>
<P>
That is the state of thoroughbred breeding and racing in Colorado. It is all 
but dead, existing in name only. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that way since 1984, since Arapaho Park shut its doors. And it can 
be directly related to Centennial Downs -- the home of thoroughbred racing in 
Colorado for 34 years -- which was sold to developers in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Centennial Downs had a devastating effect. The industry, which was 
in good health in the early 1980s, has never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
And ever since Longacres Race Course was sold in September, the question has 
been out there, dangling: Is Washington's thoroughbred industry headed for the 
same fate? 
</P>
<P>
The similarities between the thoroughbred breeding and racing industries in 
Colorado and Washington are striking, eerily so. 
</P>
<P>
"The parallels go right on down the line," Martin said. "At Centennial they 
sold because the land was more valuable than what the racing industry could 
bring in, same as Longacres. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sold to out-of-town investors. At Longacres, Boeing bought it. But it's 
still a corporate thing." 
</P>
<P>
The similarities do not end there. The sale of Centennial Downs sent a shiver 
through the horse-racing community in Colorado. The horsemen were sent 
scrambling, trying to come up with a long-term solution in a short period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
They had to search for a site to build a race track, for investors to foot the 
bill. They had to build a race track from scratch, starting with nothing but 
the gumption to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1983, the horsemen in Colorado were in the very same position 
their counterparts in Washington have faced since the Alhadeff family sold 
Longacres' fertile 215-acre plant in Renton to the Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the horse racing and breeding industry in Washington have 
secured one more season of racing at Longacres, but are still searching for 
viable alternatives for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, anyway, the horsemen can only hope they fare better than Arapaho 
Park did. 
</P>
<P>
When it was built in 1984, Arapaho was the Colorado horse racing community's 
answer to the sale of Centennial Downs. The track was built on 273 acres of a 
700-acre development in Arapaho County at a cost of about $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was plagued with problems from the start, everything from poor financing and 
a large debt to poor access and fan support. Arapaho survived for just one 
season. After that, it was closed. Bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
With no racing, the breeding industry shriveled. The entire industry and all of 
the related businesses went into a downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are staggering. In 1983, Centennial Downs' last year of operation, 
there were 161 broodmares registered in Colorado. Today, there are just 19. In 
1982, there were 311 foals dropped in Colorado. Last year, there were 76. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people asked, 'Why should we even be here if there isn't any racing. 
We have no place to race,"' said Ingrid Knotts, of the Colorado Thoroughbred 
Breeders Association. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our big farms are gone now," she said. "They all moved to Oklahoma, 
Texas and New Mexico. We don't have many, anymore. They all just sold out or 
moved." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could paint a better picture, but I can't," Martin said. "There's 
been a chain reaction throughout the state since then." 
</P>
<P>
The breeding industry has suffered, restaurants and hotels and motels have 
closed down. "It's hard to say how many people have been affected," Martin 
said. "I'd probably under-estimate it and I wouldn't know where to start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's affected so many people, grooms, veterinarians, feed stores, all of the 
agri-businesses ... 
</P>
<P>
"They all start looking for greener grass. And if they can't find it in state, 
they go out of state." 
</P>
<P>
It is not a pretty picture. But the mistakes made there provide valuable 
lessons for horsemen in Washington who are now trying to find a site to build a 
race track. 
</P>
<P>
The process of building a race track from scratch is not as easy as connecting 
the dots, from A to B to C. There are other letters to be considered, like E 
for environmental impact study, T for taxes, L for licensing, and S for 
shortcut, which Washington horsemen would be wise to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
There is also P -- as in panic button. Push it, and problems -- of which there 
are many -- multiply. Arapaho Park is proof of that. 
</P>
<P>
"Arapaho Park opened in May of 1984 and it was only about half completed, which 
was a bad move," said Eddie Hasley of the Colorado Racing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a bad winter, were rushed for time, and they didn't get the facility 
completed. But they needed to open because of some stock and bond issues and 
they wanted to open to try and get some of their investment back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a mistake on everyone's part. There were a lot of obstacles to 
overcome and they didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
The track suffered from inadequate funding. The facility was located in the 
country and some of the roads leading to the facility were not yet paved when 
the track opened for business, Hasley said. 
</P>
<P>
The track came in far short of projections in attendance and mutuel handle, 
averaging 1,986 patrons and $172,446 in handle for its 77-day thoroughbred 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
In its last season, Centennial Downs had a average daily handle nearly double 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disastrous," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The track folded up neatly as a pup tent and the owners filed for bankruptcy at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Arapaho Park now sits Southeast of Denver, half completed and completely empty. 
Several people have talked about reopening the facility, but nothing has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Arapaho Park crushed the momentum the horse men needed to get 
the industry back on its feet. The emotion has faded, and the future looks more 
grim as each year passes. 
</P>
<P>
That is the danger Washington horsemen face. One bad venture could further 
cripple the industry. As it is, their task is infinitely more difficult than 
the one Colorado horsemen faced. 
</P>
<P>
In today's market, analysts say a new facility could carry a price tag much 
closer to $100 million than $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
The last five race tracks built in the United States cost an average of $70.2 
million, with a high of $97 million at Remington Park in Oklahoma City and $40 
million for Prairie Meadows in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
To its advantage, Washington's thoroughbred racing and breeding is 
significantly larger than that in Colorado and may have more resources at its 
disposal. But even then, it can ill afford even a single bad step -- the impact 
of one is plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a pretty good bunch of breeders and owners," Hasley said. "The horse 
racing industry in Colorado was big, but it has been a steady decline since 
Centennial closed down. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will every get back to where it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can certainly feel for the horsemen and the community there in Washington. 
When Centennial closed, everything faded and it has not come back to this day."

A NIGHT FOR KING AS BULLETS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For one night, Bernard King was better than Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
King scored 18 of his 44 points in the fourth quarter -- including Washington's 
last 12 points -- and made a free throw with 1:03 left to give the Bullets a 
103-102 victory over the Chicago Bulls Saturday night at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked extremely hard during the off-season on my jump shot," King said. "I 
think it was obvious tonight. In the first half I struggled, but in the fourth 
quarter I didn't hesitate to shoot the ball and fortunately it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
King made 14 of 30 shots and 16 of 21 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who had 28 points, missed a 12-foot jumper with 38 seconds left and, 
after a miss by Washington, had his last-second layup blocked by Harvey Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"He leaned in trying to get some body contact, so I went to the side as he was 
going up," Grant said. "We knew he was going to drive, and luckily I was there 
to block the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Washington led, 99-95, but Chicago scored five points in a row to take the 
lead. King made a basket to put the Bullets ahead and added a free throw to 
make the score 102-100. Two free throws by Chicago's B.J. Armstrong tied the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 106, New York 103 -- Larry Bird and Reggie Lewis warmed up in the fourth 
quarter and rallied the Celtics from a 17-point deficit to a victory over the 
Knicks at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis scored 10 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and Bird had eight of 
his 21 in the final period when the Celtics took the lead for the first time. 
At halftime, Bird was two for 11 with five points and Lewis three for nine with 
six points. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing had 27 points, 20 rebounds and six blocked shots for New York. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 106, Cleveland 97 -- Vinnie Johnson's third-quarter shooting broke open 
a tight game as the Pistons defeated the Cavaliers at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had 11 points, scored seven as the Pistons opened the third 
quarter with a 21-10 run for a 75-60 lead. The Pistons outscored the Cavaliers, 
24-16, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Daugherty scored 35 points for Cleveland. Isiah Thomas had 24 points for 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 102, Phoenix 101 -- Karl Malone's two free throws with 41 seconds left 
gave the Jazz a split with the Suns in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns and Jazz were tied 33 times, including 11 occasions in the fourth 
quarter before Malone's free throws. The lead changed hands 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson and Tom Chambers missed shots for the Suns in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Malone scored 29 points, and Kevin Johnson had 28 for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 121, Indiana 120 -- Dominique Wilkins' two free throws with seven 
seconds left capped the Hawks' rally from a 15-point deficit to a victory over 
the Pacers at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, who scored 30 points, missed two free throws with 32 seconds left. But 
he stole the ball, drove the length of the court and was fouled by Chuck Person 
as he attempted a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller had 33 points and Person added 27 for Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 112, New Jersey 110 -- The 76ers benefited from a questionable 
call to defeat the Nets in overtime at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Nets' 30th in a row on the road, two short of the NBA record. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets had a 102-99 lead in the final seconds of regulation, but the 76ers 
tied the score with 1.3 seconds left when rookie Derrick Coleman was called for 
goaltending on a desperation three-pointer by Charles Barkley. Replays showed 
the shot was short and wide. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley scored four of his 27 points to give Philadelphia a 110-106 lead in 
overtime before Jud Buechler's layup got the Nets close, but Coleman's 
three-point shot at the buzzer bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Theus had 36 points for the Nets. Hersey Hawkins scored 30 for the 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 118, Houston 106 -- The SuperSonics scored nine consecutive points late 
in the game to beat the Rockets at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier McDaniel, who scored 24 points, made 11 of 16 shots as the SuperSonics 
won in K.C. Jones' first game as their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon had 26 points for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 111, Minnesota 93 -- Ricky Pierce and Alvin Robertson each scored 18 
points and the Bucks held on to beat the Timberwolves at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce had eight points in the final quarter when the Bucks, who led by 20 at 
the half, finished off the Timberwolves with a 12-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell had 30 points for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 104, Orlando 97 -- Armon Gilliam had 19 points, 13 rebounds and three 
blocked shots as the Hornets extended the Magic's home losing streak to an NBA 
record-tying 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando's last home win came last Feb. 27 against Charlotte. The defeat tied 
Cleveland's string of 15 home losses in the 1981-82 and 1982-83 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 140, Denver 110 -- Roy Tarpley had 25 points and 13 rebounds as the 
Mavericks easily defeated the Nuggets at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Harper added 21 points for Dallas. Orlando Woolridge scored 21 for 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 95, Sacramento 93 -- Jerome Kersey's four points in the last seven 
seconds gave the Trail Blazers an overtime victory over the Kings at 
Sacramento.

PHEASANT TRAPPING KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY VOET, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The instructions were all too reminiscent of failed snipe hunts of 30 years 
past. Remember the family camping outing and the nightly ritual for the 
ever-elusive -- and quite mythical -- snipe? I can still hear the words: "Get 
the rope, the net, don't talk, and bring the box in case we catch him." 
</P>
<P>
Now I was getting instructions that sounded distinctly familiar, only with a 
complex twist. 
</P>
<P>
"Your job is to take the spotlight and keep it on the bird," our leader 
lectured. "It doesn't blind them, just dazzles them. And you, with the net, you 
circle around them from the left, and make sure you are on your tip toes. Creep 
up on them, and don't raise the net. You have to be patient but aggressive. God 
makes netters, and we'll find out right away if you are a netter or not." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, sure, I figured. Little did I know how this intricate, nocturnal trapping 
technique would lead to the capture of a number of pheasants, an important 
procedure in assuring large populations of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
John Massie is assistant upland game coordinator for the state Department of 
Fish and Game. Part of his job for the past four years has been trapping wild 
pheasants and relocating them to areas where their populations are sparse. Some 
pheasants are relocated on private lands. 
</P>
<P>
But private landowners have agreed to open their land to public pheasant 
hunting on a community-hunt basis so the program benefits all. 
</P>
<P>
Massie often has trouble finding help for the all-night mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the boss comes in and says we have to do it tonight," Massie said. 
"Even when I know in advance, getting people to stay up all night pheasants is 
often a hard idea to sell." 
</P>
<P>
It's 10 p.m. Mike Grima and I are standing at a spot near the Yolo County 
landfill. We just received spotlight and netting instructions from Massie. 
Grima is a warden with F&amp;G, and neither of us had been pheasant trapping 
before. We were both intrigued and decided to volunteer. "You guys have plenty 
of caffeine in you?" Massie asked. "Let's go out and see what we can find." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Massie started a six-wheel vehicle in motion. I was in the passenger 
seat with a million-candlepower spotlight. Grima was in the back, another 
spotlight in one hand, a big fish net in the other. The star thistle and giant 
aster, some of it 8 feet high, made it difficult to clearly see any roosting 
pheasants. 
</P>
<P>
An hour went by, and nothing. Then a quick movement was seen, and some red eyes 
reflected the lights. "Rabbits," Massie said. "Pheasant eyes don't reflect." 
</P>
<P>
More movement -- a skunk -- along a bank. "That's not a good sign," Massie 
said. Not good, because no one wants to run into a skunk in the middle of the 
night, and skunks are good at eating pheasant eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find them," Massie said. "Sometimes we go along and see nothing, then 
all of a sudden 20 or 30 jump out. They bunch up." 
</P>
<P>
Just then, a pheasant jumped and flew about 30 yards and landed. Grima jumped 
out of the vehicle as Massie hit the throttle. I kept the spotlight on the bird 
as well as I could. 
</P>
<P>
When we reached where we thought the bird landed, Grima had already swung wide 
left. The plan was to herd the pheasant to Grima. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhaust is in the left front of the machine, and between that noise and 
your spotlight, Mike should be able to sneak up on the bird. One of the states 
that traps the birds has tapes of Janis Joplin blasting on the grill (to help 
shield the trapper's movement)." 
</P>
<P>
Just as I spotted the hen on the ground and saw Grima circling in behind, she 
took off again, this time about 100 yards. Massie hit the throttle, and we were 
off. Grima was left running through the thistle and aster, hoping a hole or 
small ditch wasn't between him and the pheasant. 
</P>
<P>
"She should be around here," Massie said as he slowed the vehicle. "Look for 
the tops of the thistle moving. They'll run a little and then stop. There. Over 
there about 10 yards to your left." 
</P>
<P>
I turned the spotlight and saw the top of some thistle moving. By now, Grima 
had caught up and was slowly getting in position. Massie moved the vehicle 
toward the bird, and suddenly I could see the hen looking right at me. Massie 
moved the vehicle toward at her, I kept her in the spotlight, and Grima moved 
in from behind. Grima made a leap, and the hen was in the net. 
</P>
<P>
I got out and grabbed her legs and pulled her out from the net and took her to 
Massie. He tagged the hen, and we put her in the cage in the back of the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a netter," Massie said of Grima. "Let's go see if we can find 
some more." 
</P>
<P>
Eight hours later, with Grima and me trading duties, we had 40 pheasants. The 
last two hours, between 4 a.m and 6 a.m., were hardest. The birds did not fly 
as much. They wanted to sleep, so they stayed on the ground a lot more. Problem 
was, we also wanted to sleep. Our eyelids were heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"For never having netted before, you guys did a good job," Massie said as he 
transferred all the pheasants from the vehicle to a big van. "I would have been 
happy with 20 birds. Thirty would had been great. But 40 is fantastic. I have 
to get this vehicle (the borrowed six-wheeler) back to Grizzly Island and then 
get the pheasants on a plane (for shipment to Imperial Valley in Southern 
California). I'm doing this again tomorrow night. Anytime you guys want to 
volunteer again, just give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
One reason Massie pursues this program is to show the public that F&amp;G is 
interested in doing pheasant management work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to help the pheasant population and show all those who buy 
hunting licenses that we do put their money to work," Massie said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, wild pheasant populations have dropped from 50 percent to 75 
percent. Ringnecks have virtually disappeared in some areas that had supported 
good populations. Loss of essential cover is the primary reason to the decline. 
Intensive control measures for weeds, insects and rodents, land leveling, 
cropping patterns and practices, and other recent developments in agriculture 
all contributed to loss of pheasant cover. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the relocation program featured 10 release sites, some on wildlife 
areas owned by the state, others on private land. 
</P>
<P>
"We get some criticism that we are taking pheasants off public land and putting 
them on private land," Massie said. "But -- and I want to emphasize this -- we 
do not take pheasants off land that is hunted. And by putting them on private 
land, which is open to the public for a fee, say $40 or $50, like most 
community clubs charge, it's easier to control entry. It's not a problem for 
the landowner, trespassing is cut down, and the public hunter gets a place to 
hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Massie is looking for a few good men or women to help him trap pheasants. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers are always welcomed," Massie said. "The problem is that I never 
know when I will have the chance, and it's hard for people to come out on the 
spur of the moment and then have to go to work the next day after being up all 
night." 
</P>
<P>
If Massie can find areas to trap pheasants, he plans to trap them through 
February. It is a job that requires some degree of conditioning and willingness 
to stay awake all night. 
</P>
<P>
"If people plan to help," Massie said, "they better plan to stay awake all 
night and work all night." 
</P>
<P>
Netting is more physically demanding than spotlighting. Often the spotlighter 
stays in the vehicle and watches the pheasant, while the netter is either 
chasing the vehicle and pheasant or circling to get in position to net the 
pheasant.

UPSETS THE RULE IN CALIFORNIA CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If nothing else, the first California Cup was a longshot player's delight. 
</P>
<P>
Upsets were the rule during the $1 million, seven-race series spotlighting 
California-breds. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa's Pleasure, who went wire to wire in the Juvenile Fillies, the final 
race, was the lone favorite to reach the winner' circle. The biggest surprises 
came from Great Event, who won the Starter Handicap at 19-1, and Gum, who won 
the Mile at 16-1. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bill Spawr had to settle for second with heavily favored Sensational 
Star in the Sprint, but his disappointment didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, My Sonny Boy, a horse Spawr claimed for $62,500 June 16, led 
every step of the way and won the richest Cal Cup race, the $300,000 Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Riding to instructions, Jorge Velasquez, who replaced the absent Pat 
Valenzuela, urged the 5-year-old out of the gate, was able to get over to the 
rail from his outside (No. 14) position into the first turn, and kept right on 
going to provide Spawr with his most lucrative victory. 
</P>
<P>
My Sonny Boy completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:46, one-fifth of a second off Star 
Spangled's track record -- over a track that favored front-runners all 
afternoon. My Sonny Boy finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of 15-1 shot Stylish Stud, 
who was later disqualified and placed third for coming out and bumping Rob An 
Plunder, the original third-place finisher, in the final sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
Blinkers have obviously made a difference to My Sonny Boy. Since they were 
added three races ago, he has two victories and a second and he had all kinds 
of trouble in his defeat in the Pomona Invitational Handicap at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse wants to be on the lead," said Spawr after another of his astute 
claims paid off in a big way for owner Carlton Sell. "He has no punch. You have 
to let him run out there, stride out and finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told Jorge to put him on his toes and put him on the lead. He won at 
Pomona (the C.B. Afflerbaugh) and I thought he was five lengths the best in the 
Pomona Handicap, but he got into all kinds of trouble. I've been pointing him 
for this since that race." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a huge victory for Velasquez, who is giving California another try 
after a long and successful career in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Spawr told me not to let this horse get stopped," he said. "He's a big 
horse. He told me to get him away 1-2-3 to avoid losing ground. I didn't need 
the whip to get him going, and when we got the lead, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going easy. It didn't seem like he was going that fast (22 1/5, 45, 
1:09 and 1:33 3/5 for the mile). He finished strong, too. This is my biggest 
win in California in some time." 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, who could have gone over $1 million in career earnings with a 
victory, finished sixth as the lukewarm 3-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Gum, who had won only one of his previous nine starts on the turf, outfinished 
another outsider, 7-1 shot Individualist, to win the $150,000 Mile. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional victory for trainer Mel Stute. Gum is owned by The Hat 
Ranch of Bay and the late Ken Schiffer, a longtime force in the California 
thoroughbred industry who died earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Schiffer wanted this one because her husband was so much a part of the 
California Cup," Stute said. "We were very close. It meant a lot to me to win 
on this day for him." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal's Game made it five victories in six starts by beating troubled 
stablemate Mizter Interco by three-quarters of a length in the $100,000 
Juvenile. Treated with Lasix for the first time, the Crystal Water gelding 
covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 2/5 under Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa's Pleasure's final time in the Juvenile Fillies was the same as that of 
Crystal's Game as she remained perfect in four starts. Owned and bred by 
87-year-old Lester Smith, the daughter of Greenwood Star began her career in a 
$32,000 maiden race at Los Alamitos last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant Pete, who was racing with Lasix for the first time, ran six furlongs in 
1:08 1/5 to surprise 7-10 favorite Sensational Star by a half-length in the 
$100,000 Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Julio Garcia and trained by John Sadler, the 4-year-old gelded son of 
The Irish Lord drew away after a :43 1/5 half-mile, had a 2 1/2-length lead 
after completing five furlongs in :55 1/5, then held on. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Card picked the right time to win her first race of 1990 in the $150,000 
Distaff at 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. Winless in 10 previous starts this year 
and a loser in five earlier grass appearances, she and Gary Stevens defeated 
favored Survive by 3 1/2 lengths in 1:12 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Great Event, who was claimed for $25,000 by trainer Robert St. Cyr on Aug. 11, 
outbattled Comical to win the $50,000 Starter Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile could clinch an Eclipse Award with a victory in the $400,000 Yellow 
Ribbon Stakes today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old Ile de Bourbon filly hasn't been out since beating males in 
Hollywood Park's Sunset due to a shin problem, but she has been training very 
well for Ed Gregson. Before the Sunset, she also beat the boys in the Golden 
Gate Handicap and has won three of her four U.S. starts. Corey Black again will 
ride.

Quiet American, bumped from the field in the Breeders' Cup, ran the fourth 
fastest mile ever in New York on Saturday in winning the $638,000 NYRA Mile at 
Aqueduct in 1:32 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old colt, a grandson of record-holder Dr. Fager (1:32 1/5), took the 
lead at the start, was eased back, then came on again to retake the lead 
entering the stretch. Through the stretch, Quiet American widened his advantage 
to 4 3/4 lengths, carrying 116 pounds and ridden by Chris McCarron.

MOSFILM GOES HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
NOW THAT MOSCOW'S MOSFILM STUDIO HAS WON INDEPENDENCE FROM THE KREMLIN, FILMS 
DEPICTING A DARKER SOVIET PAST ARE SUDDENLY POSSIBLE 
</P>

<P>
In the big, long, gloomy boardroom lined by dark heavy wood, the two Oscars in 
a glass cabinet catch the eye. 
</P>
<P>
They are meant to. Here at Mosfilm, the world's largest movie studio, these 
Oscars have assumed a special significance in the last 18 months. They 
represent everything Mosfilm is now working toward -- international 
recognition, worldwide audiences and, above all, money from wherever the studio 
can find it. 
</P>
<P>
Mosfilm, a huge facility on 125 acres in Moscow's Lenin Hills district, employs 
approximately 4,500 people. It operates like an efficient factory, and its 
output is remarkable. From its dilapidated office buildings and its sound 
stages bathed in a murky half-light, it annually produces 45 to 50 films and a 
dozen series for Soviet television on an aggregate production budget of $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1924, seven years after the Russian Revolution, it has 
essentially been the film arm of the Soviet Union's propaganda machine ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
This has not prevented fine films being made here -- "War and Peace" (1968) and 
"Dersu Uzala" (1975), which won the Oscars in the glass cabinet (for best 
foreign film) are just two of them. Mosfilm has been the "motherland" studio to 
a long line of great Soviet directors, Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky 
being the most recent examples. Still much Mosfilm product over the years has 
concentrated on glorifying the Communist Party in the eyes of Soviet filmgoers, 
with scant regard for what the outside world would think. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, 1989, all that changed. 
</P>
<P>
The advent of President Mikhail Gorbachev, and his policies of glasnost and 
perestroika, affected the Russian film industry as much as the rest of the 
country. Filmmakers were suddenly free to express ideas and tackle topics 
hitherto deemed unmentionable. 
</P>
<P>
"We've started to deal with the negative side of our history," says Vladimir 
Dostal, sitting down at the head of the boardroom table. Dostal is general 
director, or studio head, of Mosfilm. He's also deputy chairman of the state 
committee on cinematography -- a cabinet-level post in Gorbachev's hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to say in our films -- prostitution doesn't exist, drug abuse doesn't 
exist. That's 'over there,' in the U.S. And then three years ago, we started 
telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
That was a consequence of Gorbachev's glasnost policy, and it represented a 
vastly different way of making films in the Soviet Union. Then last year came a 
change that has proved equally profound -- Mosfilm now has a mandate to forget 
the old order of total reliance on state and subsidies, and gradually become 
financially self-reliant by taking its place in a free market economy. A law 
granting Mosfilm complete autonomy from the state-run film ministry recently 
was signed by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve self-reliance, Mosfilm has been looking to produce some films with 
worldwide commercial potential. This may sound obvious to Americans, but within 
the Soviet film community it is, well, revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step in this transitional phase, Mosfilm has entered into a number 
of "joint venture" agreements with foreign film companies that will co-produce 
films at Mosfilm and on Soviet locations. "This year there are 45 films being 
made at Mosfilm, and 20 are joint ventures," says Dostal. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of this is everywhere at Mosfilm. One hears not only Russian, but 
English, French and Italian spoken in its corridors. Outside, part of the 
backlot has been flooded to stage a stunning reconstruction of Venice, complete 
with canals, bridges, gondolas and fading, elegant waterfront buildings; this 
is for a movie called "The Siege of Venice," an Italian co-production with 
Isabella Rossellini and Tom Conti. 
</P>
<P>
Another film in production at Mosfilm epitomizes the startling new era being 
entered by the studio. Called "Assassin of the Tsar," it is part of a joint 
venture between Mosfilm and a British company, Spectator Entertainment 
International. 
</P>
<P>
The venture calls for six films ("Assassin of the Tsar" is the second) to be 
produced over two years. Each film will be shot in English and Russian, and 
will be distributed both in the West and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Mosfilm-Spectator deal truly extraordinary is the subject matter 
of the first two films. The first, "Lost in Siberia," now in post-production, 
dealt with the hideous reality of daily life in Stalin's labor camps -- the 
first time this topic has been realistically committed to film in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
For "Lost in Siberia," an exact replica of a labor camp was built in the city 
of Jaroslavl, about 200 miles north of Moscow -- complete with barbed wire, 
high wooden walls and towers armed with guns. Says its director, Alexander 
Mitta: "They had to make an announcement on the radio to tell people that it 
wasn't a real camp being built." 
</P>
<P>
The movie stars British actor Anthony Andrews (from TV's "Brideshead 
Revisited") as a British scientist working in Iran close to the Soviet border 
in the late 1940s. He is captured by the KGB, accused of being a spy and thrown 
into a camp in Siberia. Mitta used 15 consultants on the film, all of whom had 
spent a minimum of 10 years inside a camp, (as had an aunt who raised him). "It 
is a story," he says simply, "about the circumstances of slavery." 
</P>
<P>
"Assassin of the Tsar" also boasts a British star, Malcolm McDowell (best known 
for "A Clockwork Orange"), as well as Oleg Jankovsky, arguably the Soviet 
Union's most prominent movie actor. McDowell plays a schizophrenic patient in a 
contemporary mental asylum who believes he is Yurovsky, the man who killed Tsar 
Nicholas II and his family in 1918, after the Russian Revolution. Jankovsky is 
the doctor assigned to cure him. In a series of flashbacks, the killing of 
Nicholas and his family, including his young children, is portrayed in bloody 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been impossible to make this film here four or five years ago," 
says Dostal, speaking through an interpreter. "Even the mention of the word 
tsar would have stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
But even more astonishing are the views of the film's director, Karen 
Shakhnazarov, who has grave misgivings about the origin of the Russian 
Revolution. "The tsars were executed without any attempt to make it 
legitimate," he says. "In 1918, no one was very concerned about what happened 
to them (the royal family). 
</P>
<P>
"And now it's like a burden on the shoulders of the Russian people. They need 
some way to put this story into (the context of) contemporary life. Because the 
revolution was an attempt to build a paradise on the blood of children. And you 
can't. It goes back to what Dostoevsky once said: Try to build a beautiful 
building on the tears of one, it's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Shakhnazarov added that it became possible to write a script for "Assassin of 
the Tsar" last year, when the government opened official archives and documents 
dealing with the tsar's family. "There was a report by Yurovsky, who described 
all the details of the execution," he said. "There is a voice-over in the film 
taken directly from his report. Historically we are very authentic." 
</P>
<P>
Although some reports and rumors insisted that Anastasia, one of Nicholas II's 
daughters, survived the executions and escaped, Shakhnazarov says historical 
facts do not support such a theory. 
</P>
<P>
Given his views about the origins of the communist revolution in his country, 
what kind of films had Shakhnazarov made before the glasnost era? "Comedies," 
he shrugged. "Comedies and musicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Assassin of the Tsar" and "Lost in Siberia" are relatively low-budget films 
(approximately $7.3 million) in which Mosfilm has not invested heavily; about 
$300,000 for "Assassin" and only the use of services and facilities for 
"Siberia." Even if they make big profits internationally, Mosfilm will not 
share much of them and will achieve little in its move toward self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of a U.S. Mosfilm production, called "Icons," which is now 
shooting at the studio. It's the story of a young American (Frank Whaley, soon 
to appear in Oliver Stone's movie about the Doors) who visits Moscow, and on 
his last night gets involved with a young woman (Natalya Negoda, star of 
"Littel Vera") who has stolen an icon. Together, they are pursued around 
Moscow, and they encounter its seamier side. Intriguingly, film director Roman 
Polanski, in self-imposed exile from the United States since becoming involved 
in a morals case, also is in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
The film is being made by Largo Entertainment. Executive producer Lou Stroller 
said that "Icons" was the first U.S. film to be shot entirely in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We (Largo) are putting up all the money," added Stroller, "and Mosfilm have 
been hired for their facilities and services. We're still working on a budget, 
but it should be between $5 million and $7.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
To make a comparable film in the United States, he estimated, would cost at 
least $12 million. "I've had offices at Fox and Universal for some time, and to 
be honest, Mosfilm didn't mean anything to me. I came here on a scouting trip 
because I was very dubious about coming here. Russia was our enemy -- we were 
told that for years. But the people are great, we're living well, we're eating 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Mosfilm, I was flabbergasted. They have over 120 acres and the 
facilities to do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Stroller also likes the way Mosfilm is run. "At Universal, I've met Lew 
Wasserman, but if I have a problem, I can't pick up the phone and talk to him. 
Here I pick up the phone and I do talk to Vladimir Dostal. And things get 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Cheapness is a major factor in shooting here, Stroller conceded. "I produced 
'Sea of Love' and 'A New Life' in Toronto, because it was advantageous to do 
so. I made a film in London when it was advantageous to do so. Now, you have to 
be someone like Spielberg to say, 'Oh, I think I'll make my film in London.' 
Otherwise you don't, because of what the dollar is worth there. Now I'm here, 
because Americans will go anywhere to make movies." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia held a fascination for many American directors, actors and 
crew members because they had ancestral roots in the country. "There's an 
intrigue about it," he said. "Right now, it feels like opening up virgin 
territory. It hasn't been explored." He giggled. "Or exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Stroller was largely persuaded to film in the Soviet Union by Anatoly Fradis, a 
former Mosfilm executive who now runs AFRA Film Enterprises, a Beverly 
Hills-based company that represents Mosfilm in the United States, Canada and 
the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Fradis, who was visiting Mosfilm to ensure that "Icons" started production 
smoothly, said his job was to persuade American studios or production companies 
to make films in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
From his four-man office on Wilshire Boulevard, Fradis arranges meetings with 
independent producers and studio production heads to extol the virtues of his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to convince them that the Soviet Union is not as disastrous as they 
think," he said. "They have to believe that you can have normal working 
conditions here, that you can find your way around, and have decent hotels and 
food. But it's a big gap between California and Moscow -- 89 degrees to 42 
degrees, for a start. It takes a lot of publicity and advertising to promote 
(Mosfilm), to show the sound stages and recording studios. It's not easy to 
convince people." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Mosfilm was starting to gear its operations toward future 
co-productions. Dostal, said Fradis, was negotiating with the Hilton hotel 
chain to build a luxury hotel near the studio. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Icons,' " he added, is "a first experience. If it's successful, we'll be 
able to bring in more co-productions." He admitted pulling strings at Mosfilm 
to ensure "Icons" was given sound stage space at short notice after the deal 
was struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe 'Icons' is more important than "Lost in Siberia" and "Assassin of 
the Tsar," Fradis added. "This film can bring a lot of U.S. money and producers 
into this country." 
</P>
<P>
The new freedoms now being given to Soviet filmmakers induce a heady sense of 
excitement. They acknowledge they now have unparalleled scope to make films the 
way they want. But they also sense a price must be paid for such freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
"Lost in Siberia" director Alexander Mitta, for one, has a sense of unease 
about the number of co-productions originating from other countries that now 
involve Mosfilm. 
</P>
<P>
"We (Russians) feel like foreigners," he says. But he is also realistic: "It's 
a fact of life, it's additional money for technology for the creation of 
films." The glasnost era has also seen American films hitting Soviet movie 
theaters in a rush; Dostal estimates that of Moscow's 125 theaters, 60% are 
showing American films. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his misgivings, Mitta has already been a beneficiary of co-productions. 
He admitted that "Lost in Siberia" was turned down by Mosfilm as a possible 
domestic film: "I wanted to build a camp," he recalls, "and they said, no one 
is interested in camps." But when the British Spectator group invested money 
and were seen to be serious, Mosfilm decided to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shakhnazarov seems pleased as the new era of co-production with 
other countries. He also points out that the Gorbachev era has seen many 
directors who once worked regularly no longer being invited to make films. 
These party hacks, said Shakhnazarov, "got a university certified which gave 
you the right to make films. Nowadays that means nothing. Their professional 
level was too low." 
</P>
<P>
Oleg Jankovsky, a mid-40s actor with a piercing gaze, feels no ambivalence 
about co-productions. "Our acting theory is very good," he said, noting the 
Russian acting teacher Stanislavsky's influence, "but Russian actors are not 
known in the world. We can't go to the world screen ourselves because we don't 
have the hard currency. So co-productions with foreign (companies) can give us 
the money, and we shouldn't be ashamed of it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jankovsky harbors no expectations of becoming an international film star 
just because American are shooting in his homeland. "We're all governed by 
God," he shrugs, "and maybe one day Spielberg will be interested in Russian 
history, come up to me and ask me to star in a film. But I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Would he want to be a Hollywood leading man? After all, Jankovsky is a 
classically trained theatrical actor. Would he feel comfortable in Hollywood 
movies, long on car crashes? 
</P>
<P>
He grinned slyly. "Yes, I would I like that very much." 
</P>
<P>
The money would help. Jankovsky, like all Soviet actors, is paid modestly. (He 
declined to state his exact salary.) "But I would not like to have Stallone's 
destiny," he added with a twinkle. "Although he is famous and popular and earns 
$11 million for a film, I don't think he is a good actor or artist. I wouldn't 
like to be used that way. 
</P>
<P>
"But I respect Hoffman, Nicholson, DeNiro and Pacino. I might not want 
Stallone's $11 million, but Hoffman's $6 million would do," Jankovsky said, 
deadpan. "The $5 million lacking would be compensated by the audience's 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm McDowell rates Soviet actors high and finds them thorough and 
professional. "Film making is slower here," he noted. "But that's because there 
are no deadlines. We can make this film in five or six months, eight or 10, and 
who cares? It's not a market economy yet. If an actor falls sick, they just 
stop. In the West, if you're sick, you go in and work. It's just a different 
mentality." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell did concede that the Russians were hard to motivate. "They get paid 
such a pittance," he said, "that loyalty to the project can only take you so 
far." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the enthusiasm at Mosfilm, it is hard to see Soviet cinema spreading 
its wings just yet and becoming a major force in international film. In part, 
this is due to the state of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Soviets even afford to go to the movies when times are so hard? "We 
only have four TV channels," says Vladimir Dostal, "and there's no place to go. 
That is why Soviet filmmaking has to be commercial and interesting. We have to 
attract people to cinema as a primary form of recreation." 
</P>
<P>
Dostal noted that a Mosfilm documentary released in theaters, called "You Can't 
Live Like That," had drawn long lines; tickets sold on the black market for 15 
rubles (about 25 cents); the normal price is up to two rubles (three cents). 
</P>
<P>
"It was about the way of life in the Soviet Union. President Gorbachev was 
impressed by it, and praised it. He thought it proved there were big audiences 
for the right films. "Culture is a (low priority) in the state budget," he 
said. But there have been periods before when we've been optimistic, and 
stepped back. Today in film we're at our most optimistic ever." 
</P>
<P>
Mitta acknowledges that life in the Soviet Union is hard: "There's more drama 
in real life today than in our film stories," he complains. 
</P>
<P>
But he's also reveling in the freedom of a new era: "In film, we have the 
chance to express things no one else has expressed. We're on the verge of a 
Klondike." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1971 a 28-year-old photographer named Larry Clark published a book of 
photographs called "Tulsa." Comprised of 50 black-and-white photographs shot 
from 1963 through 1971, the book sold for just $5 a copy and was published in a 
small edition of 2,700 at a cost of $8,000. A lone wolf from Oklahoma, Clark 
had only the most tenuous ties to the world of fine art photography at the time 
-- he had never exhibited his work, and this, his first book, was released with 
no fanfare or promotional push. Nonetheless, it's unlikely that anyone who saw 
that book has ever forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed today as a landmark work of autobiographical photography, "Tulsa" is a 
brutally frank essay on the wasted lives of a group of amphetamine addicts who 
lived in Tulsa during the '60s. A matter-of-fact chronicle of a violent 
lifestyle that revolved around hypodermics, guns, casual sex and petty crime, 
"Tulsa" was not a detached portrait of some exotic subculture Clark examined 
with the cool curiousity of an artist -- this was Clark's life and these were 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
As he explains in the book's brief introductory text: 
</P>
<P>
 "i was born in Tulsa, Okla. in 1943. when i was sixteen i started shooting 
amphetamine. i shot with my friends everyday for three years and then left town 
but i've gone back through the years. once the needle goes in it never comes 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has spent the better part of his life struggling to free himself from 
that dismal prophesy and to break away from the poisonous involvements that 
simultaneously fueled his work and threatened to destroy him. He credits a 
combination of luck, genetics and art as being the lifeline that allowed him to 
survive an experience that killed most of his cronies. However, Clark's art has 
come slowly, and for long spells, it didn't come at all. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the better part of the '70s in a stoned stupor, and 19 months 
(1976-78) in jail for violating the parole he was sentenced to for shooting an 
acquaintance in the arm during a poker game. Perhaps the most extraordinary 
thing about Clark is that through it all, he retained a sense of himself as an 
artist and managed to transform the wretched experiences he repeatedly brought 
on himself into powerful photographs that are insightful, moving and curiously 
tender. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's recent exhibition at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Soho is a 
comeback of sorts. Just the third body of work he's completed in 27 years, it's 
also his first show of new pieces in seven years (much of this work is 
scheduled for exhibition at the Luhring Augustine Hetzler Gallery in Santa 
Monica in 1992). Lauded as a "powerful commentary on social hypocrisy" by New 
York Times photography critic Andy Grundberg, the show includes a series of 
provocative photo collages centering on juvenile delinquent boys, male teen 
idols and young hustlers on Times Square and is a further articulation of 
themes introduced in "Tulsa." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the 47-year-old artist at his gallery, one encounters a tall, 
rangy man who looks considerably younger than his years and remarkably healthy 
in light of his past. Amiable and eager to accommodate the interviewer's needs, 
he is nonetheless guarded and a bit shy. One also notes that while he seems to 
have made peace with the troubled adolescence that launched him on the rocky 
road he's traveled, those early wounds aren't completely healed -- he speaks of 
his past in a bruised and faintly wistful voice. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Tulsa in 1943, the middle of three children, Clark was a sensitive 
child who came into puberty late and stuttered severely. He saw little of his 
mother who worked long hours as a baby photographer to supplement the family's 
meager income, and his father -- a severely depressed man who spent most of his 
time locked in his bedroom eating ice cream -- ignored Clark completely but for 
occasional outbursts of criticism and rage. 
</P>
<P>
"My father never taught me anything, never hung out with me and never talked to 
me," Clark recalls. "Beginning around puberty I was totally by myself. I don't 
want to make any easy cop-outs or blame anybody, but my family did play a role 
in the direction I took in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens to you during adolescence has a tremendous impact on your 
life," says Clark, whose obsession with the theme of adolescence can be seen as 
an attempt to reconstruct his own misspent youth. "This has certainly been true 
for myself and most of my friends. I've known so many people whose lives were 
permanently ruined by the time they were 15 -- their whole mode of thinking is 
irrevocably formed by then. If they couldn't get laid, if they had acne, if 
they were made fun of, if that was the best time of their life and it's 
downhill from there on -- however you're treated marks you permanently. There 
is no ideal childhood, of course, but it's almost impossible to navigate that 
period of your life without good parenting -- and that's missing for so many 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
In his early teens Clark fell in with a tough crowd that introduced him to 
drugs. At the same time he began assisting his mother with her door-to-door 
baby photography business, so his interest in photography and drugs developed 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with my mother all the time it became a natural thing for me to have a 
camera," he recalls, "then one day I realized you could do more with 
photography than just take baby pictures. I also realized I was part of a world 
I'd never seen photographed before." 
</P>
<P>
Following high school graduation in 1960, Clark attended the Layton School of 
Art in Wisconsin from 1961-63, then in 1963 he returned to Tulsa and spent the 
next two years taking drugs and shooting the pictures that eventually led to 
"Tulsa." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking things about the people in these photographs is the 
casual way they toy with death -- they seem to have no regard whatsoever for 
their own lives or anyone else's. People overdose, pregnant teen-aged girls 
inject themselves with drugs and their babies are born dead, loaded kids suffer 
accidental gunshot wounds, and nobody bats an eye. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in 'Tulsa' had absolutely no fear of death," Clark says. "You don't 
realize you're mortal until your early 30s, so that fear comes later in life. 
They had no fear, but they did have a sense of hopelessness and that's 
something I felt too -- that started very early for me. I think we all yearned 
for another way to live, yet we surrendered to a certain kind of life and a 
sense of despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on that scene was really messed up and I always knew it wasn't good 
-- I never thought drugs were good. At the same time, I liked drugs and we had 
a lot of fun. People like to get high -- it's just part of human nature that we 
like to play around with our minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Another reason people get into this lifestyle is boredom -- it's a pretty 
exciting lifestyle comparatively speaking," he adds. "Say you've got a young 
girl who works in a bank and lives with her parents. It's a pretty boring life, 
then one day she meets some character like someone from 'Tulsa' -- someone into 
drugs and wild kicks. That looks pretty attractive at first. Within six weeks 
her money's gone, she's lost her job, she's using hot credit cards -- and it's 
exciting for a while. I've known countless girls like that." 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Clark took his pictures to New York hoping to generate some interest 
in his work, but he was drafted before he got his foot in the door of the art 
world. After a two-year stint in the Army, he returned to New York where he 
spent the next two years immersed in the then-burgeoning hippie scene, taking 
drugs and pictures and partying. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was influenced during those years by the photography trends of the 
early '60s, Clark says "I don't think I was influenced by people like Robert 
Frank, but I was certainly inspired by them. The movies probably played the 
biggest role in shaping my sense of aesthetics, but basically I've always had 
my own sense of the way my work should look and don't like to be influenced by 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, however, that I was influenced in the early '60s by Bob Dylan and 
Lenny Bruce. Those guys told the truth and I felt they were doing something 
important. The photographer Eugene Smith was also important to me for that 
reason. Smith worked for Life magazine and he made a big stink about their 
approach to photojournalism, which he felt didn't go deep enough. He eventually 
resigned from Life and went on to write these long diatribes about truth and 
photography. More than Gene's photos, I think his philosophy was important for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Clark traveled through Mexico, then returned to Tulsa for a brief 
spell during which he lived with several prostitutes and shot more pictures 
that would eventually turn up in the book. In 1969, he moved to Santa Fe with a 
girlfriend, then in 1970 he returned to Tulsa, and with the financial aid and 
encouragement of photographers Danny Seymour and Ralph Gibson, finally 
completed the book. 
</P>
<P>
"The publication of the book affected me lots of different ways," he recalls. 
"Some people were frightened by it, others were sympathetic and thought it was 
some big anti-drug statement, and lots of girls in black leather jackets came 
around wanting to date me because they thought I was a Hell's Angel or 
something. My reaction to it all was just to keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, people told me I should get on the lecture circuit and give talks 
at colleges and so forth, but I thought that was the worst thing I'd ever 
heard. To think I'd take my life and my friends lives and run around speaking 
about it like that was the biggest put-down in the world -- I wanted to punch 
the people who even suggested it. I wasn't into promoting myself or trying to 
make money off the book, which I never did. The important thing has always been 
just to do the work and get it out there." 
</P>
<P>
After the publication of "Tulsa," Clark received an NEA grant for his next 
book, which took him 12 years to complete. The positive response "Tulsa" 
elicited did little to quell his appetite for drugs and wild living, and he 
spent the next five years involved in various run-ins with the law, as his 
friends from the early days in Tulsa died one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"By the mid-'70s my life really derailed," he says. "I was totally out of 
control and doing lots of drugs. Basically, I took on the combined persona of a 
lot of the people in the book and had begun acting out the sorts of scenarios I 
hoped to photograph. I was conscious of what was happening to me but it was 
such a crazy time I couldn't control it." 
</P>
<P>
This increasingly chaotic period didn't end until Clark was thrown in prison in 
1976. After his release in 1978, he returned to New York, where he met his wife 
of 12 years. The Clarks and their two young children live in Princeton, and 
Larry commutes into Manhattan every day to work in his Soho studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped getting high when I was 35 because I finally just burned out," he 
says of that turning point 12 years ago. "Lots of friends were dying then -- 
really tough men and women were just cracking -- and my body totally broke down 
and I was forced to clean up. It's good it happened because my spirit and mind 
were pretty shot by then, but nobody knew how to quit drugs in those days. 
People understand how to quit drugs now, but in those days it was assumed you 
either committed suicide or kept going until you died." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Clark published his second book, "Teenage Lust," which was a further 
exploration of adolescent rites of passage. Focusing on sex this time rather 
than drugs and violence, it was every bit as powerful as his first book -- in 
fact, some consider it the better of his two books. Structured as an 
autobiography, the book includes pictures of Clark from throughout his life, 
and concludes with an autobiographical text so nakedly honest that it's painful 
to read. 
</P>
<P>
"With 'Teenage Lust' I really thought I'd gone too far, particularly with the 
text," he says. "I figured I'd lose all my friends and my wife and nobody would 
ever speak to me again, but I knew I had to do it because it was a strong piece 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
"And with this new work I feel I've gone too far again. It's funny, but it 
seems that when I get scared and think I'm showing too much, that's when I know 
it's time to show. It's hard on a person working this way, but I'm from 
Oklahoma and the philosophy there is run with the ball," he adds with a rueful 
laugh. "That's the only explanation I've been able to come up with for the life 
I've led." 
</P>
<P>
Like "Tulsa" (which went through a second printing in 1982), "Teenage Lust" was 
a big critical success and a second edition came out in 1987. Both books are 
currently out of print, and if you manage to find one the price tag can be as 
high as $750. Clark himself owns just two copies of each book, so they hardly 
made him rich -- in fact, it wasn't until 1979 that he began being able to make 
a living from his work, which is still modestly priced: A black-and-white print 
goes for $1,200, while his large new collages which go up to 4 x 5 feet, sell 
for around $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Presently at work on a new book to be published next year by Thea Westreich, 
Clark describes his new work as an extension of the early stuff in its 
preoccupation with the loss of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all fascinated by the loss of innocence because we have a deep need to 
believe in something and innocence is tied to that need. I feel less and less 
innocent as I get older, but I still continue to be surprised when something 
happens to shatter the bubble and I'm forced to look at the fact that you can 
count on almost nothing. Still, none of us ever really wise up. Something new 
comes along and we fall into that same naive mode of perception." 
</P>
<P>
As with his early work, Clark's new pieces -- which include news accounts of 
teen-age murderers and members of satanic cults -- involve an element of 
sensationalism. One could make the case that this is the lazy man's way to 
powerful art -- that anyone dealing with such volatile subject matter could 
turn a few heads. Clark disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people photograph subject matter that's potentially very powerful and 
they just don't know how to do it. It often happens that photographers shoot 
people involved in disturbing things and they make them look so horrible that 
the viewer can say this has nothing to do with me. I depict the people I shoot 
as real human beings so people relate to them regardless of what they're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's photographs are indeed much more accessible than most work of this 
genre, but his portraits of the young and the restless are still subtly 
horrifying. Asked to explain the human compulsion to look at disturbing images, 
Clark says "people like to live vicariously through images of other people. But 
I think the reason people are drawn to my pictures is because I'm a good 
photographer -- although a lot of people think I'm a total primitive. When 
'Tulsa' came out, people said 'the photography's no good, but it's a real good 
book anyhow.' I think the reason people perceive the work that way is because 
the subject matter upstages the technique." 
</P>
<P>
Clark is admittedly conscious of the technical composition of his pictures; how 
conscious is he of his attitude towards the people he depicts? Does he intend 
that his pictures convey any judgment? 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a moral person, but my photographs aren't calculated to 
address those issues. Sure, the pictures comment on social hypocrisy and the 
ways disfunctional families affect kids, but I'm not trying to make some grand 
statement on human nature -- I'm just trying to show things the way they are. 
These are simply pictures of my life, as I lived it."

To some observers of the new television season, the infamous philosophy of 
revered soul poet Gil Scott-Heron may appear to be coming true: The revolution 
is being televised. And it's something of a laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
The language and rhythms of young inner-city life are moving from the boom 
boxes of teen-age cruisers into the square boxes of America's living rooms. 
Sparked mostly by the growing crossover popularity of rap, the staying power of 
NBC's youth-oriented "A Different World" and the popularity of Arsenio Hall's 
syndicated talk show, television comedy is increasingly becoming more black -- 
and white -- and rap all over: 
</P>
<P>
* Fox's "In Living Color," the first network comedy-variety show with an 
African-American perspective, has earned critical acclaim and an Emmy Award. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air," a comedy about a teen-age rapper transplanted 
from the mean streets of Philadelphia to a Bel-Air mansion, was hailed during 
the preseason by NBC program executive Brandon Tartikoff as the show that the 
top-ranked network felt would secure its No. 1 status. 
</P>
<P>
* "True Colors," a new comedy about an interracial family on Fox, features a 
black teen who bewilders his white grandmother with rap lingo. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the soft-edged "The Cosby Show" is featuring new teen characters that 
network executives admit reflect a more street-wise attitude than the regular 
Cosby family members. 
</P>
<P>
Hip-hop has gone High Concept. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers eyeing the new trend say network television is trying to hook 
young audiences reared on MTV while offering adults a unique, fast-paced 
cultural perspective. It's another way to try to stop viewership from further 
erosion, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, said that his network and 
others are tapping into what's current and happening. "We're always trying to 
push ourselves and be relevant -- that's what television has to be," he said. 
"I think all these shows are trying to pick up on this urban sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
But the question has also been raised by media experts, sociologists and some 
entertainment industry executives about whether viewers are actually getting a 
raw deal with the raw comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Network television has taken something current and hot, and is trying to wring 
all the value out of it," said Sherrie Mazingo, a USC journalism professor 
specializing in social aspects of the mass media. "But they haven't put enough 
thought and substance into it. It's just one-line premises." 
</P>
<P>
She and other critics contend that television, because of its commercial 
nature, is just skimming the surface of the young and vibrant African-American 
culture, and has largely watered down or diluted the dynamics of the material 
it hoped to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a step forward when television goes beyond Jack Benny's Rochester 
or Stepin Fetchit, but it's difficult for television to reproduce an accurate 
sensibility," said Gerald Horne, chairman of the black studies department at UC 
Santa Barbara. "Perhaps the writers of these shows have problems getting 
certain perspectives past the standards and practices committee. Perhaps that 
accounts for the inability to accurately capture that sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
Some watching the urban-tinged shows say they are pleased to see African 
Americans depicted in a more realistic and favorable light than they were in 
such 1970s and 1980s shows as "What's Happening," "That's My Mama," "Sanford 
and Son" and "The Jeffersons" -- or even in current series such as ABC's 
"Family Matters." 
</P>
<P>
"In Living Color" is cited by several sociologists and academicians as the most 
accurate and effective in reflecting the diverse attitudes and culture of 
Africa-Americans. But they added that the improvement in the general images 
presented is not enough, and could, in fact, be sending a dangerous message to 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"We still live in a segregated society, and the images on television don't 
always represent a broad spectrum," Horne said. "Maybe it should. I know that 
there was a certain environment that produced Rochester and 'Birth of a 
Nation,' and that environment still exists. There could come a time when all we 
have is distorted images or no images at all. It would be naive to rule that 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Charges of the perpetuation of negative racial and sexual stereotypes have been 
leveled against "In Living Color." "Fresh Prince"' has been criticized for its 
attempt to squeeze a rapper into a conventional "fish out of water" sitcom 
format. "True Colors" has been knocked as not going far enough in dealing with 
the obvious tensions of such an interracial union. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some TV viewers feel that some of the rap-tinged humor has 
already gone too far. James Carrey, the only white male member of the "In 
Living Color" troupe, said that he was once approached by a white fan who said 
that he wished the show would "knock off the black (stuff)." Rosie Perez, who 
choreographs the show's "Flygirls," said that a major record company executive 
warned her when she was first hired that middle America would not cater to 
hearing rap music during the frenetic dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment industry insiders and outsiders say the timing of the new trend 
probably has more to do with economics than social awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of 'In Living Color' made it obvious to network executives that 
blacks on television can make money," said Franklin Ajaye, a comedian and actor 
who wrote for the show during its first season. "It also has a lot to do with 
Madison Avenue. When they started putting rappers in ads, that sealed it." 
</P>
<P>
Herman Gray, associate professor of sociology at Boston's Northeastern 
University, pointed out that the networks were establishing the shows "at a 
time when there is a decline in viewership. They need a new market. And the 
clothing and music of young urban African-Americans has a proven crossover 
appeal to suburban white kids, so there is definitely a move by the networks to 
get a new audience." 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince" creators Andy and Susan Borowitz said that the new hip-hop trend 
was also a response by network executives to the deteriorating popularity of 
the standard family-oriented comedy that reached its peak in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a white, middle-class kind of comedy, but it's losing share points," 
Susan Borowitz said. "If it wasn't skewed for older audiences, it was being 
written by older people for younger audiences, and that doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
NBC programming chief Littlefield had said in a previous interview that the 
network had been inspired to produce a rap-oriented show by cover stories about 
rap in Newsweek and Time magazines, and by "Yo! MTV Raps." "I was . . . feeling 
waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams of 
culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we 
looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented,' " he 
recounted. 
</P>
<P>
Many rappers appear to be happy with the dawning of the hip-hop TV age. Popular 
rap artists hang out at tapings of "In Living Color" and "Fresh Prince." They 
beg to have their records played during "In Living Color's" dance segments. The 
tapings have a party-like atmosphere. Audience members rap in their seats and 
dance in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
One person who is not surprised by the emergence of "hip-hop" comedy, and the 
breakthrough success of "In Living Color" in particular, is Keenen Ivory 
Wayans, the show's creator, executive producer, co-writer and co-star. He 
believes that even though his program has a black perspective, the appeal cuts 
across several age and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Following its debut on Easter Sunday last April, "In Living Color," which airs 
Sundays at 8 p.m. on Fox, earned mostly high praise -- and an Emmy Award for 
best comedy/variety series -- for its pointed, irreverent sketches. The show 
has also been praised for its biting, sometimes brutal parodies of celebrities 
such as Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson and Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would catch on," Wayans said. "I always had a good feeling about it. 
It was different, but I knew people would watch it if it was funny. It has the 
same appeal as hip-hop or rap. It's hip-hop TV, but it's something that reaches 
the masses." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what message the masses are getting, however, is the subject of an 
escalating debate. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is the most-hyped and most controversial -- 
attempt by network television to get into the groove. It premiered with what 
many felt were admirable credentials. Music producer and composer Quincy Jones 
is a co-executive producer. Noted African-American playwright and actor 
Samm-Art Williams is a producer and writer. Actress and choreographer Debbie 
Allen directed the pilot and other episodes. 
</P>
<P>
The show revolves around Will, an inner-city teen from Philadelphia (played by 
real-life rap star Will Smith of D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) who 
moves in with his stuffy, wealthy relatives in Bel-Air to escape from getting 
into trouble with the homeboys back home. 
</P>
<P>
Will's street smarts frequently clash with the country-club values of his 
family, who, for the most part, seem to have lost touch with their cultural 
roots. The family and butler are mystified, bewildered and, at times, horrified 
by Will's antics and lingo. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main targets of Will's barbed wit is his pompous, Ivy League 
college-bound cousin Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), whose main enjoyment in life 
appears to be a good game of golf: 
</P>
<P>
Carlton (offering the Prince a snack): What do you say to an Oreo? 
</P>
<P>
Will: I say, 'Whassup, Carlton?' 
</P>
<P>
Will's new environment and his enrollment at the fictional Bel Air Academy also 
puts him into conflict with his old street-wise friends. During a recent 
episode, Jeff (Jeff Townes, a.k.a. D.J. Jazzy Jeff) interrupted Will, who was 
working on a poem for the poetry club: 
</P>
<P>
Jeff: Man, I got this new Ice Cube tape. It's dope. 
</P>
<P>
Will: I ain't got time for that. I've got to finish this poem. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff: Poem? Then what you gonna do? Bake some cookies? Hem a dress? 
</P>
<P>
What sold NBC on the show, Littlefield said, was Smith. "When I was looking at 
a tape of the Fresh Prince and his music video, there was just something 
electrical that was jumping out," he said. "It was his personality, it was his 
attitude. It was a hip character attitude of the kind that had not been on 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought, 'How do we package that sensibility? The sensibility was so wildly 
entertaining.' We thought to put it in a world that didn't understand it." He 
noted that the program was not so much a showcase for rap as it was a showcase 
for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Fresh Prince" has not been the critical or ratings hit that NBC 
executives had predicted. Critics of the show have included some in the cast 
and crew of "In Living Color," who felt Smith was appealing, but that the 
concept had more gloss than substance. 
</P>
<P>
They are not the only ones blasting the show. 
</P>
<P>
Other media watchers have attacked the Fresh Prince character as a barely 
disguised version of the "J.J." character on the 1970s "Good Times" television 
show. J.J. (Jimmie Walker) was the focus of heavy criticism by blacks, who 
described the depiction of his cartoonish demeanor and mock bravado as 
insulting and unrealistic, especially in a show about a struggling family 
living in a housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Gray, who is working on a book dealing with African Americans in 
commercial television, said that "Fresh Prince" reflects an unfortunate dulling 
of the rap culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It really does tame much of the very rap sensibility it wants to celebrate," 
Gray said. "I think they lost courage. This was a grand opportunity to take rap 
seriously, to see what the internal sensibility was. But once a concept like 
that gets into the machinery of television, it just gets too hard to combine 
the two elements." 
</P>
<P>
USC's Mazingo said of "Fresh Prince": "It's dumb. It's stupid. It's insulting 
and demeaning, idiotic and flimsy." She said that it represents "the 
perpetuation of the classic stereotype throughout literature and popular 
culture of the black as buffoon, as the comedic clown." 
</P>
<P>
Mazingo, a former NBC News editor and producer, considers the show's premise to 
be its main problem. "The premise is unbelievable," she said. "It says you can 
take a kid of the ghetto, plunk him in Bel Air, and the values will fit 
together comfortably. That is not real." 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield disagreed with the critics who charged that the show had watered 
down rap. "We're really presenting this character in all forms of his life -- 
in his school life, in his social life," he said. "I don't think we've 
compromised there. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is in its early stages, and is still evolving. But the essence is 
that this family can learn something from him, and he from them. That tension 
makes it entertaining. He's not all right, and they're not all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Borowitzs insist that they are hearing nothing but praise from viewers 
about the show's point of view and realism. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people who are unhappy with what we're doing? They're not writing us," 
Susan Borowitz said. "But we have received lots of letters from viewers for 
addressing intercultural class awareness. We've also received letters praising 
us for having Will being interested in education." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Borowitz added, "Teen-agers can smell a fake faster than anyone, and this 
has become the hottest show in America with teen-agers. That's a key to how 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, presenting a gritty picture of an inner-city youth is not the object 
of "Fresh Prince," the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
"This show will not be just one thing," Susan Borowitz said. "There will be 
moments where we will address racial issues. Then there will be other weeks 
when we just have a great time." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Borowitz added, "This show will do more if there is a broad-based appeal. 
You can't be angry all the time. Otherwise, 'The Life and Times of Sylvia 
Plath' would be the No. 1 show." 
</P>
<P>
Another new show with a hip-hop element, Fox's "True Colors," has drawn 
basically a "thumbs down" from critics and media observers, despite its 
breakthrough premise as television's first comedy series about an interracial 
family. 
</P>
<P>
In the show, Ron Freeman, a widowed black dentist (Frankie R. Faison) with two 
teen-age sons, confronts life in Baltimore with Ellen Davis (Stephanie Faracy), 
a divorced white kindergarten teacher, her teen-age daughter and her grouchy 
mother, Sara (Nancy Walker), who doesn't care for her new son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis character summarized the family's problems in the pilot episode: 
</P>
<P>
Ellen: We've got two different families, three generations and two races, not 
to mention a woman who hasn't smiled since the Dodgers left Brooklyn. One day 
we just said to these people, "Surprise, you're a family." . . . It's a wonder 
the house is still standing. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the humor on the show, which airs Sundays at 7 p.m., comes from the 
interaction between Lester, the hip-talking youngest son (Adam Jeffries), and 
Sara: 
</P>
<P>
Lester: Yo, Grandma. Check this out. Yesterday, I was shootin' some hoop over 
in the project, right? And this dude come up to me and say, 'My main man, let's 
do for some change,' y'understand? So I say, 'Homes, let's go.' So we're 
mixin', right? And WHAM! BAM! Man walks home with his jive and I walk home with 
his five. Can ya dig that?" 
</P>
<P>
Sara: That's very nice. (Turns to Ron.) What the hell did he say? 
</P>
<P>
The show is languishing near the bottom of the ratings. Michael J. Weithorn, 
the creator of "True Colors" and a former producer of "Family Ties," said that 
the new awareness of hip-hop culture had changed expectations of what his show 
should be, and, ironically, has hurt it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past few years, America has become more comfortable with a more honest, 
edgier presentation of black culture," he said. "Before, television executives 
were concerned that blacks had to be unthreatening. Anything else was 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Weithorn said he had basically just wanted to make "True Colors" a comedy about 
conflicts between personalities, not racial tension. But he said that he may 
have made a mistake in making his new family too comfortable with each other 
and their situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I want to bring in more of a raw edge, but I don't want it to be 
gratuitous," he said. "I don't want the viewer recoiling." 
</P>
<P>
But it may already be too late. Mazingo said that many conservative viewers 
would already be turned off by the program's premise, and that the rap element 
would not bring in younger or more liberal viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Although many inside and outside the industry are predicting imminent 
cancellation of "True Colors," the verdict is still out on how effective "The 
Cosby Show" -- often criticized by blacks as presenting what they feel is a 
homogenized and sugar-coated view of African-American family life -- will be in 
pumping up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Cosby" a few weeks ago introduced Cousin Pam (Erika Alexander), a 17-year-old 
inner-city youth who is a niece of Claire Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad). 
</P>
<P>
Her first brush with the Huxtable lifestyle came when she tried to persuade 
Cliff Huxtable (Cosby) to allow her to go visit her "homies . . . uh, friends" 
in the Bronx at a late-night party. Cliff raised his eyebrows when Pam said 
"homies." 
</P>
<P>
Pam's friends attempted later in the program to get Pam to break curfew and go 
to the party. But everyone wound up spending the evening with the Huxtables, 
happily drinking cranberry juice. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to make "Cosby" a tad grittier was not lost on the writers of "The 
Fresh Prince." A recent episode showed Will remarking on the development as he 
scanned a TV Guide: "Ooooooooh!!! Bill Cosby has a street-wise niece coming on 
the show. That should be decent!" 
</P>
<P>
A one-hour episode scheduled to air last Thursday focused on Pam, her friends 
and the community center where they hang out. "It's fresh territory we haven't 
been in before," Littlefield said. "Pam has friends who are clearly more 
street-oriented than the Cosby family is." 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the new urban emphasis was a natural one for "Cosby," and 
was not inspired by criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
"Every successful series, when it's in its senior years, develops and expands," 
Littlefield said. "It's just a natural place to do this now." 
</P>
<P>
The depiction of young inner-city culture in future network television shows 
will be largely determined by the success of the current programs, academicians 
and media experts say. But some added that they do not foresee future efforts 
being significantly more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more rap-oriented shows, but I think they will eventually 
disappear," Mazingo said. "They are a fleeting phenomena. The way they are now, 
they are not substantive enough to hold the attention of the target audience, 
which is young black adults, or other segments of viewership. So the networks 
will move to something else." 
</P>
<P>
"It can go either way," Gray said. "But I think there's a movement towards 
diversity, particularly in the state of California, where the television 
industry is based. To the extent that climate gets stronger, television may put 
forth more positive images." 
</P>
<P>
The worst-case scenario, he said, would be if the shows continued to be 
"watered down and normalized. But the culture will keep moving, it will always 
keep moving. It is dynamic. And television will not be able to deal with that 
until the medium is much more open."

ALONG WITH ITS EMMY AWARDS AND ENVIABLE RATINGS, 'IN LIVING COLOR' HAS 
ATTRACTED CRITICISM THAT THE SHOW DEALS IN NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES

<P>
It's midafternoon, and Keenen Ivory Wayans is in his office at Fox's Hollywood 
studios, frowning. A visitor with a 3 p.m. appointment has been waiting to 
speak to him for nearly an hour, but Wayans has other things on his mind, other 
phone calls to make. And other things to be steamed about. 
</P>
<P>
On the desk in front of him is a New York magazine that has just hit the 
stands. He is pictured on the cover with his sister Kim and his brothers Shawn 
and Damon, who all star with him on "In Living Color." The headline on the 
magazine reads, "Color Them Funny," and they are all smiling. 
</P>
<P>
But Wayans, the guiding force behind Fox's feisty comedy series, is not smiling 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like this," he says, thumbing through the article. "I don't like this 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
The article told how "In Living Color," which premiered last April to mostly 
rave reviews, has offended some African-American leaders with negative 
stereotypes. It also said that gay organizations were protesting the show's 
most notorious regular segment, "Men On . . . ," a takeoff on 
Siskel-and-Ebert-type review shows featuring two outrageously dressed and 
effeminate men, Blaine Edwards (Damon Wayans) and Antoine Merryweather (David 
Alan Grier), who employ sexual double-entendres while discussing films, art or 
books. 
</P>
<P>
"This article is just trying to create controversy," Wayans said. "It's 
dwelling on the bad things too much," adding that the story, in his opinion, 
distorted the amount of opposition by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning the Emmy Award in September as last season's best comedy-variety 
show, beating such formidable competition as "Late Night With David Letterman" 
and "The Tracey Ullman Show," Wayans and the cast have been on a roller-coaster 
of controversy and publicity. They have been besieged for interviews and 
gossip, and the same questions keep popping up: 
</P>
<P>
Did Wayans really have a falling out with Arsenio Hall when "In Living Color" 
made fun of him? (Wayans says no.) Did Wayans really have an affair with Kim 
Coles, who left the show after the first season? (Wayans says no.) Aren't gays 
offended by the "Men On. . . ." segments? (Wayans says no.) Aren't blacks 
offended by some of the images presented on "In Living Color"? (Wayans says, 
for the most part, no.) 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview, Wayans, clad in a colorful T-shirt and sweat pants, 
appeared polite but not overly forthcoming. He said that he was upset by the 
New York article, and was generally burned out by the combination of trying to 
put the weekly show together and responding to the demand for information. 
</P>
<P>
But the most bothersome questions, Wayans said, have to do with comments about 
some of the portrayals of blacks on "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
Targets have included the hosts of the Homeboy Shopping Network, two 
fast-talking hustlers (Wayans and brother Damon) who speak in rap lingo about 
getting "mo' money, mo' money, mo' money," and Anton, a homeless street 
entertainer (Damon Wayans) who disgusts onlookers with his habits of picking 
his nose and emitting body odors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a black point of view, you're damned if you show the bad side and 
you're damned if you don't," he said. "We have the same diversity as any other 
show. We don't dwell on the homeboys for 30 minutes. We also have black 
professionals, people in suits." 
</P>
<P>
When fans approach him to do more positive role models for blacks, Wayans said, 
"I ask them what they view as positive? And how do you do a positive parody? 
People expect miracles in the wrong places. This show isn't going to change the 
world. It may have an effect, but the only thing that can change the world is 
the government, and the government controls the media." 
</P>
<P>
Wayans finds the questions about "Men On . . . " more legitimate, but insists 
that he has not received that many complaints about it. And, he said, "We've 
gotten petitions from gay groups asking us to never stop doing it." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the show has been categorized as a rap show in spite of itself, 
Wayans and others say. The main mission of the show is to be funny, Wayans 
said. Much of the comedy is not racially oriented, he pointed out, and 
political satire is rare. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Perez, the choreographer of "The Flygirls," the dancers who punctuate 
each show with precision, hip-hop styled steps, said that the black or ethnic 
perspective was not a major factor of the show's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's a part, but for the most part, the show is intended to just be 
stupid and funny," she said. "This is comedy that you can do in your own home. 
It's real honest." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Franklin Ajaye, who wrote for the show during its first season, said 
that there was no order by Wayans for the writers to continually come up with 
racially based humor. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the show had a racial perspective, but we weren't told to always 
approach things with a black perspective," he said. "We were just told to get 
as many jokes into the sketches as possible. That was the mandate." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that even he felt uncomfortable with some of the African-American 
images presented on "In Living Color." That concern was shared by adult fans 
who approached him about the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Whites for the most part like the show, but there's more ambivalence about it 
in the black community," Ajaye said. "They would say, 'Hey, I like some of it, 
but I wish they wouldn't do this, or I wish they wouldn't do that.' They think 
it's a good, clever show, but they have a problem with some of the images." 
</P>
<P>
Ajaye would respond that the show was not aimed at them: "These were people in 
the 35-40 range, and I told them the show was not conceived with them in mind. 
It's aimed at viewers 14-25." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ajaye felt the show should have strived for more than just the funny 
bone. "If you're going to aim a show at urban black youth, especially when they 
are floundering in so many areas, it's not enough to entertain them," Ajaye 
said. "You have to instruct and guide them." 
</P>
<P>
Ajaye said that he and partner Barry Douglas would make attempts at writing 
relevant and topical racial humor. One skit, "Endangered Species," was a parody 
of animal trainer Joan Embrey's appearances with animals on "The Tonight Show." 
It was inspired by a talk the pair had with Wayans. 
</P>
<P>
The skit concerned an animal trainer (Kelly Coffield) who brought on an 
"endangered species" -- an inner-city teen (Tommy Davidson). During the course 
of the sketch, the trainer said that the species was endangered because of 
"homeboy poaching." "They were being killed for their sneakers," Ajaye 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The line was taken out, "because it was felt it was a downer line," Ajaye said, 
adding that he did not know know who excised it. "I got a lot of calls on that 
sketch. People felt that the idea of why the species was endangered was never 
addressed. I feel it would have been better with that line. It was frustrating. 
That was my last attempt to put a message into the skits." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his discomfort at some of the images on the show, Ajaye said he 
understood Wayans' position. "Keenen is a very committed black man who is 
trying to further the position of black people," he said. "So even though there 
were stereotypes, I give him the benefit of the doubt. Also, he has the soul of 
the comedian, and he wants to make people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Ajaye and Douglas, along with many other writers, were "released" after the 
first season. "It was felt that we were pretty much burned out, sketched out," 
Ajaye said. He said that there were no hard feelings, and that he was working 
on other projects with Wayans. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member cast has seven blacks and two whites. The director, Paul 
Miller, is white and a veteran of "Saturday Night Live." The producer, Tamara 
Rawitt, is white and ran Eddie Murphy's production company for two years. About 
half of the writing staff is minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The show is most often compared to "Saturday Night Live" in the type of humor 
and viewpoint. Some fans also noted that it shares some of that show's 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very funny and very outrageous, but just like the best years of 'Saturday 
Night Live,' they don't bat a thousand," said Warren Littlefield, president of 
NBC Entertainment. "One skit will be brilliant, then the next one will come and 
you'll think, 'How did that get on the air?' But that happened through the 
great years of 'Saturday Night Live.' Plus, this show has staked out some true, 
original characters." 
</P>
<P>
Wayans now hopes that recurring characters from the "In Living Color" 
repertoire will move into popular culture, in the tradition of "Saturday Night 
Live" creations such as the Blues Brothers, the Coneheads and the Church Lady. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely to reach star status may be Homey the Clown, a militant 
"anti-clown" played by Damon Wayans who constantly snaps about being victimized 
by society and "lies perpetrated by the Man." He whacks kids and adults with a 
stuffed black sock when they ask him to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"Degrade and humiliate myself for your amusement, huh? I don't think so," Homey 
snaps in a typical exchange. "Homey don't play that." 
</P>
<P>
Fox executives and those associated with the show say Homey's tag-lines are 
already being repeated on schoolyards and at parties. Yet even the show's 
executives seemed to have been caught off-guard by the response to Homey during 
a recent screening of an episode to a studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
The audience, composed largely of young African-Americans, almost exploded with 
cheers when a Homey the Clown sketch came on. "HOMEY!!" roared three youths. 
"Wassup?" Many chimed in when the clown declared, "Homey don't play that" after 
the clown's girlfriend tried to convince him to get a respectable job at the 
Chez Whitey restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Homey sketches and other "In Living Color" parodies are delivered with a 
knowing but sometimes bitter wink at the sensibilities that have kept edgy, 
minority-flavored comedy off the airwaves for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The humor can work on a very subliminal level, and it's saying a lot of 
unsayable things," Rawitt said. "However prevalent racism is, it's still a 
taboo topic. But through comedy, we're cleverly allowing certain things to come 
through. We're saying it still exists, and it has to be eradicated before 
progress can be made." 
</P>
<P>
Rawitt said that putting together a mainstream comedy show with a predominantly 
black point of view is not difficult: "The writing process is highly communal 
and open. Every once in a while, there might be someone who doesn't have a true 
cultural perspective of the black experience. But we take care of that. This 
show is the vision of a highly conscious black man. And we have quite a few 
black cast members. So that kind of thing can be realigned in rehearsals until 
the comedy is as funny as it can be." 
</P>
<P>
Other "In Living Color" sketches that reflect Wayans' "in-your-face, hip-hop" 
humor: 
</P>
<P>
* The Brothers Brothers, "the most non-threatening black men on television," 
starred Damon and Keenen Wayans in a musical sendup of the Smothers Brothers. 
"The networks want blacks, but they don't want them real, so Oreos like us get 
a hell of a deal," the pair sang with a smile. They were both named Tom. 
</P>
<P>
* "Equity Express," a satire of a recent credit card commercial where a black 
customer (David Alan Grier) encountered hassles from the white credit operator 
(Kelly Coffield), and was arrested when he tried to use his gold card to 
purchase clothes. "It was clear he wasn't the sort to be carrying a gold card, 
if you know what I mean," the operator said smugly to an unseen interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
* "Y. T. Guilt" starring Coffield and James Carrey as two white liberals 
talking about their guilt about their feelings toward blacks. "I called the 
cops on some black kids today who were collecting donations for the United 
Negro College Fund," Coffield's character said. "I just assumed they were gang 
members." An unseen announcer instructed them to call 1-900-Y.T.-GUILT. "Let 
one of our angry Afro-American operators put you in your place," the announcer 
said. The couple wound up talking to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan 
(Damon Wayans), who told them they felt sexually and professionally inferior to 
blacks. "C'mon, Whitey, make that call," Farrakhan/Wayans implored viewers at 
the end of the skit. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, our shows ridicule the racism that exists against blacks," cast member 
Tommy Davidson said. "The issue is there, and it seems to be an underlying 
continuum. But this is about comedy. It's not the civil rights movement."

FOLK DANCE UNLEASHES A WORLD OF ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
PRESENTING TRADITIONAL WORKS ON A CONCERT STAGE RAISES QUESTIONS FOR CRITICS, 
ARTISTS AND PRODUCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times dance writer Lewis Segal helped program the 1990 DCA 
conference. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics and audiences are trusting souls. When looking at dance that comes from 
the world outside mainstream Euro-American traditions, we usually accept it at 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
If something called the National Dance Company of China appears at the Music 
Center, we don't question its pedigree -- until a so-called Mongolian 
Herdsman's Dance shows us nomads jeteing across the stage with pointed feet, 
classical turnout and academic, Soviet-style placement. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when Tibetan monks from the Dalai Lama's own Namgyal Monastery 
perform at Royce Hall, we watch picturesque fragments of rituals that can last 
many hours, or even days, and never wonder how such drastic editing might 
despiritualize what should be a religious experience. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, dance belonging to different spatial conditions than those of the 
picture-frame stage must be adapted for our theaters, as must participatory 
dances and those that last longer than the two-to-three hours that we normally 
devote to a performance. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise of some sort is virtually inevitable, but much of the time, we grow 
so absorbed with the exotic idioms on view that we don't consider how and why 
they've been altered. 
</P>
<P>
But we should, because all too often genuine folk art becomes marginalized in 
the process, turned into diversionary spectacle. And because it comes to us so 
fundamentally trivialized, such work feeds some Americans' already inflated 
notions of cultural superiority. 
</P>
<P>
We confront or evade these problems week by week in a typical season. Indeed, 
such attractions as the recent Los Angeles Festival, "Africa Oye!" (at El 
Camino College), American Indian Dance Theatre (at the Wiltern) and Ballet 
Folklorico Nacional de Chile (at Pasadena Civic Auditorium this afternoon) have 
made the last third of 1990 into something like a laboratory for the study of 
how choreographers and impresarios tailor world dance for American audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"People will absolutely turn off from you if you do something to push them too 
far in this kind of ethnic performance experience," said Hanay Geiogamah, 
artistic director of American Indian Dance Theatre, on a panel in September's 
Dance Critics Assn. (DCA) conference at Cal State Los Angeles, the first annual 
meeting of the organization ever held in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Giving what he called a "progress report" on his company, Geiogamah spoke of 
"translating" Indian dance to the stage as "a complex challenge . . . that I 
had not really perceived." He described the process in terms of decisions about 
"editing, grouping, music choice, costume choice, intensity of mood, build, 
just so many things that I took for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Because he considers his restaged Indian dances different in function from 
their tribal originals, Geiogamah believes the shortened theater-versions have 
their own validity. Yet he recognizes the abuses that can occur: taking folk 
dance and, in his words, "tabbing it to death, because I really hate the 
tabbing and the string-'em-along little excerpts. That's a destructive, 
suffocating thing to do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In addressing the 1989 Dance Critics Assn. conference in San Francisco, Los 
Angeles Festival director Peter Sellars had attacked "Africa Oye!" as "vilely 
produced. Eight major groups of artists were slung together in a kind of 
smorgasbord treatment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine us sending to Africa a show saying 'Hello, this is Western 
Culture.' And we would send five minutes of 'Boheme' and a 15-minute excerpt of 
'Swan Lake' . . . that's the 'American Show,' and we'll take that around 
Africa. I mean, the idea is so demeaning: 'Now let's look at Africa through a 
series of 15-minute excerpts of major artists. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
"Africa Oye!" producer and co-director Mel Howard replied to Sellars' charges 
by saying, "We did not excerpt anything: Every piece in the show is complete. 
There were time constraints but we were very careful and asked the artists for 
whole pieces that did not deform a larger or longer work." 
</P>
<P>
On the "smorgasbord" issue, he said that "despite using diverse elements, my 
goal was to make a piece of theater that felt seamless. It took us two years to 
find groups that would create the proper chemistry for the evening." 
</P>
<P>
Why not longer performances by fewer groups? "I don't think that an audience 
that would be coming to see this show in huge theaters would want to sit 
through 45 minutes of most of the groups," he answered. "When we can't 
understand what they're singing, it could seem repetitive if it went on too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Sellars' own festival resorted to plenty of variety-show 
programming, both in those juxtapositions of different Native American and 
Oceanic groups at Sunset Canyon Recreation Center and in the sampler repertory 
by the Classical Dance Company of Cambodia at the Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
Although the blame for presenting ethnic vaudeville usually falls on Americans 
for not taking world dance seriously, sometimes it's a matter of what the world 
dance community thinks we can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Western attention-span is two hours," distinguished Court Art of Java 
choreographer R. Rio Sasminta Mardawa told The Times this summer, speaking as 
if citing the Koran or Bhagavadgita. Thus even the Javanese company's 
evening-long Wayang Wong dance drama "Arjuna Wiwaha" proved heavily abridged 
for American consumption: more linear or plot-bound at the festival than 
audiences find it back home in Jogjakarta. 
</P>
<P>
At least festival audiences saw the trimmed Wayang Wong at close range on the 
Arboretum's outdoor platform stage. With bleacher seating for 869, this 
performance space didn't resemble the elegant dance pavilions at the Sultan's 
palace but it proved infinitely preferable to the large proscenium theaters 
that the company encountered later on its American tour. 
</P>
<P>
Local arts writer Douglas Sadownick saw the complete Court Art of Java 
repertory in Arcadia and then caught a performance at the 2,100-seat Brooklyn 
Academy of Music some 10 days later. "It was a totally different experience," 
he says. "There was a real distance between performers and audience -- as if 
you were looking at postcards. It was dead on that stage. Everyone around me 
was sleeping and if I had seen it there for the first time, I wouldn't have 
found it interesting at all." 
</P>
<P>
On the same weekend that the Javanese opened in Arcadia, the DCA conference was 
convened, directed by the Oakland Tribune's David Gere and former 
Herald-Examiner dance critic Elizabeth Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day event included everything from an interview with modern-dance and 
ballet choreographer Mark Morris to film clips compiled by UCLA professor of 
dance ethnology Allegra Fuller Snyder illustrating how Hollywood has shaped 
American notions of world dance. Michael Blackwood previewed his film "Butoh: 
Body on the Edge of Crisis" and festival artists gave master classes that 
helped critics better understand unfamiliar idioms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the critics, Alastair Macaulay (the Financial Times, London) spoke about 
the importance of sensibility in writing about dance, Marcia B. Siegel (the 
Christian Science Monitor) on describing the experience as clearly as possible 
without cultural bias, and Joan Acocella (Dance Magazine) on how our American 
heritage offers a deep personal connection to many different traditions. "I 
don't think we can see beauty that we haven't been taught in some measure to 
see," she argued. 
</P>
<P>
Issues of cultural entitlement and colonialism inspired heated debates, with a 
number of prominent academics (some of whom moonlight as critics) helping 
clarify historical and sociological patterns. 
</P>
<P>
In his paper on the politics of international cultural exchange, Ricardo D. 
Trimillos, professor of ethnomusicology at the University of Hawaii, used 
examples from Guatemala, China and the U.S. to explore a worldwide "co-optation 
of minority culture by majority society." 
</P>
<P>
"Troubling is an often encountered majority attitude that minority dances are 
easy or less profound," he said. Trimillos also asked hard questions about the 
confusion between what he called "folklore and fakelore," and took on the 
volatile subject of authenticity. Without stating a preference, he 
distinguished between reproducing a classic form (a hula danced exactly the way 
it looked at some time in the distant past) and preserving a social function 
(creating hulas just as relevant to Hawaiians as the ancient ones used to be). 
</P>
<P>
"Who has the right to present and represent a tradition. . . ?" he asked. "Do 
we impose our standards of dance and dance presentation on others through our 
media, through our scholars, our exchange teachers and, yes, through our dance 
critics?" 
</P>
<P>
Although the theme of the DCA conference was "Critical Imperatives in World 
Dance," a number of speakers addressed unfinished business in American society: 
racism and entrenched Euro-American "norms" that define cultural value. None 
proved more eloquent than Brenda Dixon, associate professor of dance at Temple 
University, in her detailed audit of the unacknowledged debt that American 
concert dance owes to African and African-American traditions: 
</P>
<P>
"What sublimation had to be enacted by the guardians of American culture to 
erase my culture from a society that's virtually seething with its presence?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The Afrocentric legacy is not a choice, but it's an imperative that comes to 
us through the culture . . . like electricity through the wires. We draw from 
it all the time even though we're not necessarily aware of the sources. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Some conference spectators complained about "white-bashing" and fled. Others 
grew sanctimonious about their enlightenment and hissed speakers who hadn't yet 
mastered the approved multicultural terms of endearment. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in his interview with Acocella on the creative influence of his 
training in flamenco and Balkan dance, Morris reminded the most disruptive 
attendees that there was more than one way to talk about multiculturalism. 
"Lighten up!," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No chance. Right now, the matter of exactly who can -- or can't -- be described 
as "we," "us" or "the Other" in American dance translates into grants, 
commissions, media attention and, for better or worse, standards of excellence. 
The DCA spent four days and $70,000 (the largest conference budget in the 
organization's history) studying the subject and, in the end, arrived at only 
one principle that nearly everyone present might accept: 
</P>
<P>
In the '90s, world dance, like charity, begins at home.

ON THE RECORD: WHY SUCH A DEARTH OF DVORAK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the abiding musical mysteries of our time is the lack of appreciation of 
one of the most accessible, likable and consistently inspired of Romantic 
composers: Antonin Dvorak. The biggest-name conductors resolutely refuse to 
explore the prolific Czech's output beyond the barest handful of works. The 
enterprising musicians who do bother are infrequent visitors to our part of the 
world and when they do come, Dvorak isn't part of their baggage. Not even the 
touring Czech chamber groups, hardly strangers to our stages, offer much 
Dvorak, perhaps under the impression that we get as much of it as the folks 
back home do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet audience reaction to the odd gem that does slip through is never less than 
hugely enthusiastic, as it must be for any supreme inventor of melody, master 
orchestrator and the sort of canny showman who virtually builds ovations into 
his scores. It's almost comical then that when JoAnn Falletta programs Dvorak's 
marvelous Sixth Symphony with her Long Beach Symphony it assumes the 
proportions of an act of faith rather than being merely a wise and logical 
move. 
</P>
<P>
It was once the case that popular taste was reflected in what was recorded and, 
later, that recordings made a profound impression on live programming. In the 
case of Dvorak neither seems to be true since recordings of his music are 
numerous beyond what anyone could have imagined a quarter-century ago, when 
only a small minority of listeners was aware of the fact that Dvorak composed 
nine rather than five symphonies and as many string quartets as Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
All this by way of introduction to yet another batch of Dvorak recordings 
offering the listener opportunity to experience melodic revelations and for 
impresarios to bemoan the dearth of such unhackneyed, ear-catchingly glorious 
music on their programs. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Libor Pesek, who paid a brief (Dvorak-less) visit to the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic last season, is working his way through a cycle of his 
countryman's symphonies for Virgin Classics. 
</P>
<P>
The latest installments are the youthfully overreaching, Wagner-impregnated 
Third Symphony, in E-flat, Opus 10, coupled with the mature and pure-Slavonic 
"Scherzo capriccioso" and "Carnival" Overture (90797), and the Fifth Symphony, 
in F, Opus 76, one of those rowdy, dance-filled Czech marvels over which 
audiences, were they given the opportunity, would go wild with delight. Its 
companion piece is the more subdued but hardly less attractively folksy "Czech" 
Suite, Opus 39 (90769). 
</P>
<P>
Pesek leads with terrific brio as well as a loving ear for instrumental detail. 
His two orchestras, the Czech Philharmonic and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, 
respond vigorously, with a becoming touch of bucolic roughness in each 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Mariss Jansons, who has also put in appearances with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and is shortly to lead the Leningrad Philharmonic here, offers the 
Fifth Symphony as well, with the "Scherzo capriccioso" and the darkly dramatic 
"Othello" Overture, another of the composer's powerful, all-but-ignored late 
works. All are zestfully, idiomatically directed and alertly executed by the 
Oslo Philharmonic (EMI/Angel 499995). 
</P>
<P>
By way of contrast, Andre Previn seems a disinterested outsider looking in on 
the "New World" Symphony and "Carnival" in his latest recording with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic (Telarc 80238). 
</P>
<P>
While there may not be much to seek out in this hyper-familiar material, it 
remains difficult to recall a conductor who brings less enthusiasm, less 
rhythmic definition to these scores than Previn does. 
</P>
<P>
Telarc's uncharacteristically tubby sonics (the recording was made in Royce 
Hall last April) fail to capture the distinctive sound of the Philharmonic, 
excepting perhaps the dark sheen of its cellos. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based Chilingirian Quartet, recent visitors to the Southland, is -- 
one hopes -- working its way through a Dvorak quartet cycle for the Chandos 
label. Its latest release pairs the lush, endlessly tuneful and harmonically 
imaginative Quartets in E-flat, Opus 51, and in C, Opus 61 (8837) -- music that 
once experienced in such vivacious, polished and idiomatic performances as 
these should remain in the head and heart forever. 
</P>
<P>
A word, too, for the latest reissue of the celebrated interpretation of 
Dvorak's Cello Concerto by Pablo Casals and the Czech Philharmonic under George 
Szell, recorded in Prague in 1937 (EMI/References 63498). The transfers from 78 
r.p.m. project Casals' sumptuous tone and the incisive attack -- notably in 
regard to the solo wind playing -- of Szell's orchestra with a clarity and 
presence barely suggested in prior remasterings. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-minute-long, mid-priced CD further contains Casals' 1945 Elgar Cello 
Concerto and Bruch's "Kol Nidrei," recorded in 1936.

BYRDS' LEADER ROGER MCGUINN WENT THROUGH TROUBLED TIMES AFTER THE GROUP'S 
CREATIVE BURST IN THE '60S, BUT HIS FORTUNES HAVE TURNED 
</P>

<P>
The 12-string Rickenbacker guitar resting on a stand in Capitol Records' 
Hollywood recording studio is a Roger McGuinn limited edition model -- named 
after the man in the studio on this recent afternoon, working on his first solo 
album in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six years ago in January, McGuinn picked up another 12-string 
Rickenbacker -- a plain old 360-12 model -- in another Hollywood studio and 
played the classic riff that gave the guitar its name. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the Beatles, McGuinn, a Chicago native with a background in folk 
music, had put together a band called the Byrds in Los Angeles to experiment 
with a mix of folk and rock. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn fell in love with the 12-string Rickenbacker after seeing George 
Harrison play one in "A Hard Day's Night" and he wanted to see how it would 
sound on a Bob Dylan song that the group was planning to record. 
</P>
<P>
That session at the old CBS studio at Sunset and Gower not only launched the 
Byrds as a major new band, but it also established "folk-rock" as a valuable 
new strain in contemporary pop. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a magical moment," McGuinn says now, reflecting on the first 
time he heard the classic guitar riff of the Byrds' "Mr. Tambourine Man" played 
back for him. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Studio A, this huge room which had been Jack Benny's old radio 
studio, and (producer) Terry Melcher rolled these huge speakers out on this 
hardwood floor so we could listen to the record for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It just killed me. . . . What a sound. I couldn't believe that we had actually 
done that." 
</P>
<P>
Within six months, "Mr. Tambourine Man" was the No. 1 record in the country -- 
and the Byrds were being heralded as America's answer to the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we were all part of some elite movement that was going to change 
the world for the better through our music. . . . Not just us, but the Beatles 
and the rest. It was like a responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been lots of debate about what 'Mr. Tambourine Man' is all about. Was 
it a drug song, and so forth. To me, it was kind of a prayer. I had been 
reading books about positive thinking and the song reflected that. It was like 
me saying, 'Hey God, take us wherever you want us to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to identify now with the excitement of the early Byrds, whose other 
original members were Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman and Michael 
Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tambourine Man," however, wasn't an instant hit. In fact, Columbia didn't 
release the single for several months after it was recorded -- during which a 
discouraged McGuinn almost moved to San Francisco to join another band with 
Dino Valenti, who later joined Quicksilver Messenger Service. 
</P>
<P>
But he remained in Los Angeles and remembers the day he first heard "Mr. 
Tambourine Man" on the radio. "I was living in this little apartment just off 
Sunset and I didn't have a car," McGuinn recalls. "I was walking along Sunset 
when I heard it from a car radio." 
</P>
<P>
That was the start of a marvelous period -- especially the first 10-month blaze 
of creative energy that produced the Byrds' first two albums. Dylan joined them 
on stage at Ciro's and Lennon and McCartney stopped by the studio to hear some 
of their new material. 
</P>
<P>
For their accomplishments, the Byrds were named last week to the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, and the band's invigorating, jingle-jangle guitar sound remains 
alive in the music of such admired groups as Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, 
R.E.M. and England's new Stone Roses. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records has also just released an ambitious, four-hour CD box set of the 
group's material -- including 17 previously unissued recordings -- to mark the 
band's 25th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been dark times for McGuinn, the singer and songwriter most 
identified with the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
For all the acclaim and early success, the quintet had only limited commercial 
success -- just seven Top 40 singles, and none after 1967. McGuinn struggled to 
keep the band intact as the other original members left the nest. 
</P>
<P>
By the early '70s, the quality of the music had waned and McGuinn felt 
uncomfortable about still using the Byrds name, so he called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
"There was so much tension within the group at various times that it was a 
relief to have people leave," he says. "But at some point it just got too far 
away from what it had been and it felt strange just being on stage with all 
these new people." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn made a series of solo albums, but they didn't connect with either the 
old Byrds' audience or with the new generation of rock fans. Various Byrds 
reunion efforts also proved short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn was discouraged and partially beaten by 1977. After five solo albums, 
he was without a record contract, had gone through a divorce and was doing a 
lot of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, McGuinn simply withdrew from the music business -- so close to 
bankruptcy that he was almost forced to live in his van because he could barely 
pay the $400 rent on his house in Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn returned to music in 1980, but not on the earlier scale. For most of 
the last decade, he played small clubs or opened for other acts in auditoriums. 
For some artists of McGuinn's stature, such a drop in commercial standing would 
have been humiliating -- and made his old Byrds' hit -- "So You Want to Be a 
Rock and Roll Star" -- seem like a cruel reflection of how the record industry 
had bypassed him: 
</P>
<P>
So you want to be a rock and roll star? 
</P>
<P>
 Then listen up to what I say 
</P>
<P>
 Just get an electric guitar 
</P>
<P>
 And take some time 
</P>
<P>
 And learn how to play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's time to go downtown 
</P>
<P>
 Sell your soul to some company 
</P>
<P>
 That is waiting there 
</P>
<P>
 To sell plastic ware 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a Capitol Records lounge during a break from working on his new 
album, McGuinn nods knowingly when the conversation gets around to the troubled 
years. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, 48, always seemed a bit mysterious on stage behind those oddly-shaped 
mini-glasses. He didn't say much between songs and he was given to quick, 
unexpected smiles while singing -- as if reacting to some personal joke that he 
never quite explained. 
</P>
<P>
In the studio now, however, he seems relaxed and open -- an amiable, 
soft-spoken man who seems to have himself and his career in remarkably good 
perspective. It's easy to see why he cites a line from "Turn! Turn! Turn!" when 
asked a favorite line from a Byrds song: "To everything, there is a season. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
He realizes that it's easy for people to imagine him as bitter for the way the 
rock world seemed to turn its back on him for so long. And he acknowledges the 
awkwardness in recent years when people -- from fans to record industry 
executives -- asked him where he has been the last few years, not realizing he 
has been playing steadily for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a logical assumption to think there has been some sort of dark cloud over 
me for a long time, because I haven't been making records and people haven't 
heard about me," he says. "But dwelling on the bad times is not in my 
character." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn pauses and looks across the room, where Camilla, his wife of 12 years, 
is sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I might not have been making records for a long time, but Camilla and I have 
had a wonderful time. We go on the road together. It's not the Forums, but the 
audiences love the shows and I love being on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that's not (the public's) idea of what makes you happy in this 
business, but it's just such a rewarding experience that I never really felt 
the need to do anything else. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled to be making another album. It's not like I'm 
trying to pull a George Michael and say I don't want the pain of success or say 
that I can't handle it. But I have learned in the last few years that it's not 
something that I need to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
The Beatles may have been the key influence in McGuinn's decision to start the 
Byrds, but it was Elvis Presley who made him want to be a musician. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis hit me square and center," he says, retracing the steps that led him to 
the creative center of rock in the '60s. "It made me want to be like him. I got 
a guitar and slowed down the records and listened to the licks so that I could 
learn all the parts." 
</P>
<P>
During rock's first creative lull around 1960, McGuinn found a new excitement 
in the vigorous folk music scene of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He played banjo, guitar and mandolin in small clubs and went on the road after 
high school backing the Limeliters and the Chad Mitchell Trio. Known then as 
Jim McGuinn (he later changed his name to Roger during a brief involvement with 
Subud, an Eastern religion), he also played guitar for Bobby Darin. 
</P>
<P>
By 1964, McGuinn was eager to go on his own and he was intrigued by the renewed 
energy in rock. He moved to Los Angeles and experimented with folk-style 
renditions of some early Beatles tunes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few people who gave McGuinn any encouragement was a young 
singer-songwriter named Gene Clark. They began writing songs together in the 
front room of the Troubadour, where David Crosby -- another folkie who was 
eager to move into rock -- heard them one day and began harmonizing with them. 
Soon, the band was formed. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the band exhibited much of the Beatles' eagerness to 
investigate new musical and cultural horizons. The Byrds made influential 
singles, but the group's legacy rests mainly through albums -- from the early 
psychedelic explorations of "Fifth Dimension" -- which included the hugely 
influential "Eight Miles High" -- to the pioneering country-rock of "Sweetheart 
of the Rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
But the original group members -- because of various personal differences or 
career ambitions -- were only together for the first two albums. Clark left 
before "Fifth Dimension" in 1966 and Crosby and Clarke were gone by the end of 
"Notorious Byrd Brothers" in 1967. Hillman moved on following 1968's 
"Sweetheart of the Rodeo," forming the Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram 
Parsons, who had joined the Byrds just before "Sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
At first, McGuinn was relieved when he turned in the Byrds name and embarked on 
a solo career. But it never quite worked. 
</P>
<P>
If "Mr. Tambourine Man" was a rock 'n' roll prayer, McGuinn's personal prayers 
were answered in the months following what he described as his darkest period 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He went through a period of Christian reawakening that marked a turning point 
in what had been a depressing, downhill spiral in his life. He met his wife, 
Camilla, shortly afterwards at an acting class, and around 1980 did something, 
with Camilla's help, that few pop stars have ever done: He turned his back on 
the music business as he put his life back together. 
</P>
<P>
"Camilla and I were driving back from San Francisco after a vacation and we 
stopped in Morro Bay and just fell in love with the place," McGuinn recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we decided to move there. It didn't seem all that dramatic at the time. It 
wasn't like the record business was saying, 'We need you. Come back.' We rented 
this little house overlooking the bay and we just sort of concentrated on 
enjoying life. It was amazing how easy it was." 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly a year before McGuinn did another show -- at McCabe's in Santa 
Monica. He discovered during that show and a few subsequent ones that he 
enjoyed being on stage again. 
</P>
<P>
So, with Camilla acting as his manager, he booked a few dates around the 
country and settled on a pattern that has lasted almost 10 years now. The 
couple live in the Tampa Bay area in Florida and usually travel from show to 
show by car, with McGuinn doing about 100 shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
All the time, he heard echoes of the Byrds' music on the radio -- in the 
records of other artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it," he says. "I was like a proud dad. I was rooting for Petty and 
R.E.M. and the others. We'd hang out together when they'd come to a town I was 
in." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn's resurfacing started when he joined Dylan and Petty on a European tour 
in 1987. His new Arista Records contract grew out of an appearance last year at 
the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, where he opened for pop group Crowded House. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the recording studio, McGuinn stands behind the control board, 
listening to a playback of a song that Elvis Costello has written for the new 
album. There's an unmistakable echo of the Byrds in the track. Petty co-wrote 
and sings with McGuinn on another, and Crosby and Hillman also sing on the 
album, which will be released in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I just really didn't have a lot of question in my mind about it," he says 
about resuming his recording career. "It was just a matter of continuing with 
the direction I had always been going. It's just what I do happens to be back 
in vogue again." 
</P>
<P>
Before playing the track again, he turns for a final word, "You know, it is 
nice -- all that's happening now," he says. "There was a time when I wondered 
if anyone was going to remember the Byrds. I thought maybe the Byrds were just 
going to end up like another one of those bands . . . like Herman's Hermits or 
something . . . something that came and went. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt passed over . . . that people weren't really aware of what we had done. 
So I am very gratified now that it has come around now to where people do seem 
to realize there was something of value in what we did." 
</P>
<P>

BYRDS TO SMOOTH RUFFLED FEATHERS FOR INDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All five original Byrds will be on stage together for the first time in more 
than 17 years when they are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 
Jan. 16 in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the members of the classic Los Angeles rock band will pick up their 
instruments and join in the traditional jam that night remains questionable in 
light of longstanding rancor over disputed rights to the Byrds name. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really honored with the Hall of Fame thing," said Chris Hillman, who was 
bassist in the original Byrds. "It's the highlight of my life and I hope we'll 
all be up there together. . . . (But) I don't know if I'd ever work again with 
Michael Clarke and Gene Clark in the Byrds. I think it works best with me, 
Roger McGuinn and David Crosby." 
</P>
<P>
For the five of them to all even speak, let alone play, will be a matter of 
letting some serious bygones be bygones. Hillman, McGuinn and Crosby have 
fought a public battle in recent years to prevent drummer Clarke from touring 
with a band he calls the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a Florida judge ruled that Clarke had a right to continue using the 
name because he had been doing so for several years without any legal challenge 
by the others. Singer Gene Clark -- who wrote such Byrds favorites as "Feel a 
Whole Lot Better" and co-wrote "Eight Miles High" -- had also sometimes 
performed under a "Tribute to the Byrds" billing, but abandoned that when the 
others asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I always hold the hope that we could get rid of all the problems that stand 
between us, lay down our pride and just play music and enjoy it," said Gene 
Clark in a separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the five Byrds, and I hope that can really happen," added Clark, who 
left the Byrds in 1966. In the mid-'70s, he and McGuinn teamed as a duo, and 
were later joined by Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, too, is hopeful that "as far as standing up and receiving the award, 
the focus should be on the music and not the people now." But neither he nor 
the others minced words concerning the estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish Michael would stop going around being the bogus Byrds," McGuinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman was equally direct: "I have no quarrel with Mike. Why deny him making a 
living? But the rest of us went out and did other things (without using the 
Byrds name) sink or swim. Crosby and I feel . . . that without Roger there 
isn't a Byrds." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's response: "I think that's bull, and you can print that. How about: 
'Without me playing drums it's not the Byrds?' We all made major contributions 
to the music." 
</P>
<P>
But Clarke, too, is cautiously optimistic that the Hall of Fame setting will 
help them overcome the barriers between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust that we'll be friends there," he said. "But if not, then no problem. . 
. . I pretty much don't care what they think, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
While Clarke, who lives in Florida, will continue performing as the Byrds, Los 
Angeles-based Gene Clark recorded an album with singer-songwriter Carla Olsen 
and is planning a second, as well as a solo album. Crosby (who was on vacation 
and unavailable) remains active recording and touring with Crosby, Stills &amp; 
Nash. Hillman is now a country star with his Desert Rose Band. 
</P>
<P>
Only Hillman, Crosby and McGuinn are heard on the six new recordings included 
in the Byrds retrospective boxed set. Two of the songs are Byrds classics 
("Turn, Turn, Turn" and "Mr. Tambourine Man") recorded at the Roy Orbison 
tribute concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles last February. 
(Bob Dylan joined them on "Mr. Tambourine Man.") The other four selections were 
recorded in Nashville in August, including a version of Dylan's "Paths of 
Victory" and a new McGuinn song, "Love That Never Dies." 
</P>
<P>
The latter song bids a fond adieu to the past with a playful nod to two Byrds 
favorites, "Mr. Tambourine Man" and the wistful "Chestnut Mare," which McGuinn 
has kept in his repertoire as a solo artist: 
</P>
<P>
 Toss a dime to the tambourine man 
</P>
<P>
 And kiss all the horses goodby.

Israelis worried about what might happen to their pets during a

<P>
A Tel Aviv company on Friday began advertising gas-proof kennels.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post carried a front-page ad for the kennels, marketed by a 
company that already sells gas-proof tents for babies and special gas masks for 
Orthodox men whose beards and side curls interfere with the fit of a standard 
mask.

GLITCHES PLAGUE ARMY CHEMICAL WEAPONS INCINERATOR TESTS ON REMOTE PACIFIC ATOLL 
</P>

JOHNSTON ISLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mechanical glitches are plaguing a trial run of the Army's chemical weapons 
incinerator on this Pacific island, but officials expect to finish destroying 
deadly stockpiles on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a rough first few months for the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent 
Disposal System, the first of nine incinerators planned to rid the United 
States of its aging chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech incinerator, criticized by Pacific island leaders and 
environmental groups, has operated just 22% of the time since testing began in 
June, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Army conducted the first media tour of the island and the incinerator plant 
Tuesday . About 70 reporters and photographers were given a tour. 
</P>
<P>
The $240 million plant was built to destroy 300,000 aging chemical weapons 
moved here from Okinawa in 1971 and 100,000 rounds en route from Germany -- 
6.6% of the U.S. stockpile -- at this flat, wind-swept island 800 miles 
southwest of Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 people -- civilian contract workers at the plant and military 
members -- live on the island, which has no indigenous population. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency will decide whether to allow the Army to 
destroy more weapons after the test period is completed late next year. The 
operation is expected to wind up by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Baronian, deputy program manager for the plant, said officials had 
hoped to have the plant working 70% of the time during a 16-month test. 
Although the glitches won't doom the program, Baronian called them "very 
depressing for an engineer." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for a brand new plant to have these kinds of problems," 
Baronian said. "However, we're seeing more of these types of problems than 
frankly we anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
The main problem, Baronian said, is debris jamming a conveyor that carries away 
nerve gas rocket parts after incineration. Any breakdown in the system shuts 
down the entire plant. 
</P>
<P>
The glitches do not release any nerve gas and do not endanger plant employees. 
Still, Baronian said plant managers would rather err on the side of caution and 
shut down for any problem, no matter how minor. 
</P>
<P>
The Army will use what it learns from this plant at eight planned mainland 
incinerators that are to destroy all aging weapons by 1997, as required by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Those plant sites are Umatilla, Ore.; Tooele, Utah; Pueblo, Colo.; Newport, 
Ind.; Aberdeen, Md.; Anniston, Ala.; Lexington, Ky.; and Pine Bluff, Ark. The 
Army decided the safest plan was to build incinerators where the weapons are 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the breakdowns, the project has suffered from a public relations 
problem. Some Pacific leaders openly worry the plant may be used to incinerate 
hazardous waste and chemical munitions from mainland storage sites. 
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific Forum, an organization of regional governments, claims the 
use of Johnston Atoll could make the region "the toxic waste disposal center of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Walter L. Busbee, program manager for chemical demilitarization, 
said Johnston would be out of the chemical weapons business when incineration 
winds up in 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Bensing doesn't feel cheated by his brief flirtation with an 
age-reversing hormone that some fancy may be the doorway to a futuristic 
Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 72-year-old retired chemist has found his joints no longer ache 
constantly with arthritis and his skin is firmer, giving him the appearance and 
vitality of a man much his junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little more energetic," said Bensing, who relishes being called "son" 
by a friend about his age and now can spend more time gardening. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped taking the hormone more than 1 1/2 years ago, and doctors predicted 
the age-reversing symptoms of his therapy would fade within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, I lost all that, but I don't feel that I did," Bensing said 
recently at his rural Waukegan home. "Since the benefits didn't go away, I 
don't feel cheated. It was worth it. If it contributes to the advancement of 
medical knowledge, we don't feel cheated." 
</P>
<P>
For a year, Bensing injected himself three times weekly with the human growth 
hormone. Within six months of the first treatment, he could unscrew bottle caps 
with ease, mow the law without tiring easily and sit through lengthy car trips 
-- all of which would have been difficult months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Tests revealed the hormone treatments helped shrink body fat, restore lean body 
mass lost through aging and increase the thickness of Bensing's skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed right off he was doing things much faster," said Bensing's wife, 
Alice, 57. "He was more willing to go places and do things than before." 
</P>
<P>
The growth hormone taken by Bensing and 19 other older male volunteers is a 
synthetic version of one produced naturally in humans. As one ages, the natural 
production of the hormone fades and eventually stops, researchers have learned. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Rudman, an endocrinologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 
suburban Milwaukee and director of the experiment, said researchers have 
determined the hormone injections reversed aging in the body composition of 
elderly men by as much as 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rudman and his fellow researchers reported this summer in the New England 
Journal of Medicine that the hormone increased lean body mass in patients by 
9%, decreased fat tissue by 14% and thickened skin by 7%. 
</P>
<P>
It does not, however, affect failing eyesight, hearing loss or degeneration of 
brain cells. The improvements strictly involved the patient's body mass. 
</P>
<P>
Rudman, 62, was among a group of physicians in the 1960s who used human growth 
hormone to treat abnormally short children. He decided to experiment with the 
hormone on the elderly after watching his parents grow old and frail in a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
The hormone, once only available by extraction from human corpses, now is 
produced through genetic engineering. But regular treatment costs $14,000 a 
year for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Experts warn it is too soon to determine the severity of side effects or 
whether the hormone could be produced cheaper and more readily. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men in the experiment have declined to talk publicly since the 
study was published, some at the advice of the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Bensing, one of the first volunteers for the study, said the hormone lessened 
the crippling effects of arthritis, prompted a quicker recovery from a cataract 
operation and appeared to make a crushed spinal disk a bit sturdier. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a guy my age starting to call me 'son,' " Bensing said. "They said, 
'You look great.' " 
</P>
<P>
When he began treatment, Bensing was told the possible side effects included an 
increase in blood pressure or blood sugar. But his only complaint was a 
numbness in his wrists, which he attributed to pressure from skin and muscle 
growth. It stopped once the therapy ceased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bensing, who lost hearing in one ear while an Air Force engineer in World 
War II, said he was disappointed the hormone didn't help that. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bensing, who was born with cerebral palsy, said she too would like to one 
day receive the hormone. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had limitations all my life," she said. "I can see so many benefits for 
women, osteoporosis and other problems in the aging process." 
</P>
<P>
Rudman, whose research was carried out at veterans' hospitals in North Chicago 
and Milwaukee, said the hormone didn't appear to significantly improve bone 
density, reverse brain cell loss, cure failing vision or affect life span. 
</P>
<P>
Its value may lie in helping the chronically ill or older people prepare for or 
recover from major medical operations or illnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Axel G. Feller, who helped in the experiments at the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center in North Chicago, said researchers are not 
prepared to recommend growth hormones for the aged. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the whole picture," Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the experiments on the elderly, which began in 1980 and are 
continuing, may make therapeutic applications of the hormone available within 
five years, Rudman said.

SURROGATE CASE DRAWS FIRE FROM THOSE SICK AT HEART, SICK OF SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quoting The Times ("Genetic Parents Win Sole Custody in Surrogate Case," Oct. 
23): "The judge said a surrogate who is genetically unrelated to the child she 
carries does not acquire parental rights by virtue of having given birth to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Is this what Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. actually said, or is this a 
reporter's interpretation of the meaning of the decision? 
</P>
<P>
In either case, something is sadly missing here. I question whether anyone has 
the qualifications to make the judgment described in that quotation. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that the genetic parents, the Calverts, provided their fertilized 
egg to Anna Johnson to carry the child and that this was done under an 
agreement -- a legal contract, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
What were the terms of that contract? Was the issue resolved on the basis of 
those terms? I am sure that legal training includes plenty of contract law. I 
am also sure that legal training does not include the laws of genetics. And I 
am very sure that one does not become an authority in such matters after 
listening to a few minutes of testimony from genetic experts. 
</P>
<P>
I get the impression that nowadays our legal system obligates itself to decide 
matters beyond its jurisdiction. Aren't judges appointed to (and lawyers 
chartered into) our system of law, not to a "legal system" that sees no limit 
to its jurisdiction, and certainly not to courts of last resort for matters 
that are simply beyond their competence? 
</P>
<P>
I wish the Calverts and Ms. Johnson peace in the aftermath of their emotional 
experiences. Now that the agreement for custody is settled, I trust that they 
will ignore the pontificating statements of the judge, me, and anyone else.

<P>
I have always considered myself a strong supporter of UC Irvine. By and large, 
it has been one of the truly great influences on Orange County for these past 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
BUT! The idea of spending $3 million, no matter how it was raised, for a 
chancellor's residence on campus ("Whose Habitat?" Oct. 29) is almost 
indescribably obscene. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the entire nation is staggering on the brink of recession, when 
the homeless are flooding our parks, streets and sidewalks, when industrial 
layoffs are becoming a daily story, when gasoline prices, taxes, etc., are 
imposing even greater burdens on most of us, and worst of all, when health 
clinics for the poor, infants, children and the mentally ill are being forced 
to close left and right, I can't imagine the thinking behind all this. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the California gnatcatcher, rare as it might be. The truly endangered 
species here is us. Once again, it seems, the powers-that-be who run or control 
our educational system have vanished from the world of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Wake up, folks, before it is too late. I'm sure the poor chancellor and his 
guests could struggle along with a mere $1-million shanty on that hilltop. That 
would give them $2 million to do something worthwhile, like helping those who 
really need it. 
</P>
<P>
Just sign me, "Disgusted once more."

When Anna Johnson went to court to obtain parental rights to the baby she was 
carrying for the Calverts, she burned her bridges to any type of relationship 
with the child. 
</P>
<P>
If Ms. Johnson had spent more time "nurturing" a relationship with the Calverts 
rather than slapping them in the face with a lawsuit, the Calverts may have 
come to feel a closeness to Anna and would have welcomed her as a special 
person in their child's life.

PRESERVING OUR AIRPORT NOISE CONTROLS; 
</P>
<P>
* VOCAL RESIDENTS KEEP WEAKER NATIONAL POLICY FROM SUPERSEDING TOUGH LOCAL ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each night after 10 p.m., the noise level in the Newport Harbor area drops 
noticeably. After 11 p.m., residents in the Orange-Santa Ana-Tustin area 
welcome noise relief too, as the periodic whine of commercial jets flying in 
and out of John Wayne Airport ceases -- at least until 7 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that way for the last five years, ever since warring Newport Beach 
residents and city officials and the county, which operates the airport, 
resolved lawsuits seeking to block airport expansion by reaching a settlement. 
The compromise limits airport noise by controlling not only the hours of jet 
operation but the kind of aircraft that fly in and out, the routes they use, 
the way the flights are flown and even how many passengers can be accommodated 
at the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that agreement is still intact, thanks to a strong public reaction 
and some help from Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson and Reps. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). 
</P>
<P>
The problem began when a rider was attached to the complex federal budget bill 
that would establish a national noise-control policy at airports throughout the 
country. What most troubled Orange County, in addition to the obvious loss of 
local jurisdiction at its own airport, was that the proposed policy was far 
less restrictive than the one already in operation here. 
</P>
<P>
Local airports should be able to go beyond any minimum federal noise levels, 
especially when the quieter approach has the agreement of the the airport 
operator and the surrounding community. County residents and their 
representatives were loud and vigorous in pushing that point. Their outcry 
forced Congress to back off and sensibly include a "grandfather" clause that 
exempted existing agreements. 
</P>
<P>
It shows what can happen around the airport when you make a lot of noise.

SURROGATE CASE DRAWS FIRE FROM THOSE SICK AT HEART, SICK OF SUITS

<P>
I am sick at heart for Anna Johnson, and outraged by the decision handed down 
by Judge Parslow. Crispina Calvert's claim to the baby is no stronger than the 
traditional paternity suit made by a man not living with the birth mother of a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
If he could prove he had a genetic link to the child, he would be entitled to 
visitation rights. Physical custody of the infant would be granted to the birth 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Parslow clearly considered the case on a purely intellectual basis. We 
are talking about a baby here, not the sale of some commodity! He obviously has 
no understanding of the physical and emotional bonds that develop between a 
mother and her baby during pregnancy. To be physically one with another human 
being for nine months, to feed and care for it and, finally, to go through the 
birth experience with it creates an attachment unlike anything he has ever 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Having your heart ripped out would be the closest thing I can think of to what 
it would feel like to lose a child at this point. The Calverts have an 
intellectual interest in the baby; Anna has the physical and emotional bond of 
a mother. 
</P>
<P>
Why would Judge Parslow have concluded that the contribution of an egg in this 
case is any greater than the male's contribution of sperm, which has 
historically entitled the father to visitation rights, not physical custody of 
the infant!

PRINGLE, UMBERG INSPIRE 'NO' VOTE ON TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live in the 72nd Assembly District and am basically disgusted with the 
campaigns of both Curt Pringle and Tom Umberg. I am a strong supporter of the 
Democratic Party and looked forward to an intelligent and exciting candidate to 
run against a lackluster and ineffective Curt Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, day after day, I have received the equivalent of hate mail from each 
of the candidates. The issues have been ignored, the needs of the community 
have been ignored, and I'm sure the outcome will be yet another low voter 
turnout. (Maybe that's what the candidates want.) 
</P>
<P>
If these two individuals are the best candidates available in this district, 
this alone is reason enough to vote against Propositions 131 and 140 on term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Why would qualified individuals choose to run? Or where will we find qualified 
individuals? It certainly seems the 72nd has run out of candidates already. We 
have plenty of legislators who deserve to be voted out of office. (Bill 
Dannemeyer and Bob Dornan both come to mind.) 
</P>
<P>
If neither candidate has ideas or goals for his term in office, maybe they 
should remember an admonishment I learned in elementary school: If you have 
nothing nice to say, don't say it!

I could not believe my eyes as I read a profile of Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove) regarding his stand against abortion at any stage for any reason, 
including rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to dismiss this person as an old fool set in his ways. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is only 30 and in public office. My God, that scares me. His rigid, 
Dark Ages stance relegates women to the lowest form of humanity, having a 
lesser worth than even a fertilized egg. 
</P>
<P>
To choose the life of a fetus over the life of the mother was one of the 
saddest and most tragic acts a doctor had to perform in the 1940s. Husbands 
became widowers, children motherless. 
</P>
<P>
Every woman, Democrat or Republican, and every man who has a sister, daughter 
or wife, or any enlightened man should take to the polls and resoundingly vote 
this guy out of office. He's dangerous.

MEASURE M'S APPROACH TO TRAFFIC WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a practical sense, there's not one among us who cannot afford the half-penny 
sales tax in Measure M that would help finance the construction and 
installation of expanded freeways, better interchanges, transit systems and the 
myriad of other improvements dated to occur during implementation of the 
20-year transportation improvement plan. 
</P>
<P>
Not approving the half-penny to clean up the transportation mess that this 
county has gotten itself into simply means that conditions will become worse 
and worse, with all of the negative impacts heaping atop one another. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we should have passed such a transportation sales tax measure much 
earlier. Have the politicians and the bureaucrats come up with the right 
solutions this time? Are the transportation improvements that are so carefully 
spelled out in the 16-page Sample Ballot Measure M description the right ones? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes. This particular plan was written under the guidance of a 
20-Year Master Plan Citizens Committee that represented all of Orange County. 
These same people, and many others, also insisted that a Citizens Oversight 
Committee should be mandated to watchdog the full 20-year transportation 
improvement process. 
</P>
<P>
Will the dollars be shifted around at the pleasure of officials? Not a chance. 
Bucks can't budge from the allocated slot for which planned unless you approve 
it by a separate vote. That's keeping the control where it belongs -- with the 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, California voters approved Propositions 108, 111 and 116 that fund a 
lot of transportation and transit improvements statewide. The urban counties 
that have passed "self-help" sales taxes will be the ones that get virtually 
all of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Of the major urban counties in California, Orange County is the only one to not 
have passed at least a half-penny tax. The other counties don't really mind 
that much. San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties will 
split our funds among them if we let Measure M lose this time. While we wallow 
in our traffic woes, they'll be laughing all the way down the widened freeways, 
or as they grab trolleys instead of the keys to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
We owe our youngsters a decent place to become grown-ups. We also owe it to 
ourselves to do what we can, at extremely small individual cost, to make 
Measure M happen. It's time to start fixing Orange County.

TITANS CAN'T FIND A WAY TO STAY WITH SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With San Jose State's 44-6 victory over Cal State Fullerton Saturday night, the 
Spartans appear well on their way to a Nov. 17 showdown against Fresno State to 
determine the Big West Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, the Titans (1-9) might be involved in another showdown of sorts 
-- a game against New Mexico State to determine the worst Division I-A football 
team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which lost its ninth in a row Saturday night, is ranked 105th out of 
106 Division I-A teams by The National, an all-sports publication. New Mexico 
State is 106th. 
</P>
<P>
It's predicted the Aggies will lose to San Jose State next week. Ditto for the 
Titans against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Barring any upsets, Fullerton would play New Mexico State in Las Cruces on Nov. 
17 -- for none of the marbles. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good coach, Fullerton's Gene Murphy refuses to look ahead to a 
possible national un-championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk about New Mexico State next week," he said. "We're looking forward 
to playing Utah State." 
</P>
<P>
That sure beats looking back at Saturday night's game. The Titans were 
manhandled by a superior San Jose State team, which improved to 6-2-1, 5-0 in 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, behind the passing of Ralph Martini and the running of Sheldon 
Canley, racked up 670 yards, including 473 during a first half in which they 
took a 37-0 lead. That matched the worst halftime deficit in Murphy's 11-year 
tenure. The Titans trailed Florida, 37-0, at halftime in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Martini, with plenty of protection and so many wide-open receivers he probably 
had trouble deciding whom to throw to, completed 29 of 39 passes for 443 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Canley, a tailback who leads the nation in all-purpose yards, carried 21 times 
for 119 yards and three touchdowns and caught six passes for 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
David Blakes caught seven passes for 95 yards, and Bobby Blackmon caught four 
passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Pass defense has definitely not been our strong suit this season," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that Murphy's defensive line was without injured starters Dave 
Dorf, Jamal Jones and J.C. Farrow, that starting linebacker Stan Breland didn't 
make the trip because of an injury, and that several defensive backs played out 
of their natural positions. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans put almost no pressure on Martini, save for Clarence Siler's sack of 
the Spartan quarterback in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They have good receivers and have so many different plays and formations, it's 
hard to know where they're going to to," Siler said. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State put the game away in the first half by scoring on six of nine 
possessions. Twenty first-half offensive plays went for 10 yards or more. The 
Spartans finished with 29 first downs, compared to Fullerton's 13, and 504 
yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive, all-around performance by San Jose, but Spartan Coach 
Terry Shea's first order of business afterward was to lash out at the San Jose 
community for what he perceives as a lack of support. A season-low 11,256 were 
in Spartan Stadium to watch Saturday's game. San Jose has averaged 13,577 in 
four 1990 home games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the community doesn't understand how good a team we 
have," the first-year coach said. "We have, without a doubt, the second-best 
team on the West Coast, and I'm not so sure they appreciate that. 
</P>
<P>
"There's that old cry, that we're just playing Cal State Fullerton, but why not 
come out and watch San Jose play? This is an exciting team with tremendous 
class and intensity, and this community refuses to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy understands the part about San Jose being an exciting, intense team. 
That was clearly evident Saturday night. But he's not so sure about the class 
part of Shea's claim. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:44 left in the first half and a 31-0 lead, San Jose State put together 
an impressive, 79-yard, no-huddle drive that ended with Canley's 5-yard 
touchdown run to make it 37-0 with 38 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Shea deemed it necessary to race up the field for a score with a 
31-0 lead seemed odd enough. Then came the extra-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans lined up for an apparent kick but put on a fake. Holder Mike 
Jordan's pass attempt for a two-point conversion failed, and San Jose had to 
settle for a 37-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was upset by an apparent attempt to run up the score, an obviously 
agitated Murphy refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he faked the extra point, Shea claimed that his field-goal team has 
had problems this season, and he wanted to show that he could fake an extra 
point, perhaps relieving future opponents' rush on the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get teams to back off our field-goal unit," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
Shea's reasoning doesn't jibe, though. Granted, former Spartan kicker Raul De 
la Flor had his problems, but since David Bowen replaced De la Flor three weeks 
ago, Bowen is 4 for 4 in field goals and 14 for 14 in extra points. 
</P>
<P>
Asked again to comment on Shea's motivation, Murphy said, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's lone score came on Reggie Yarbrough's 2-yard touchdown run with 
6:15 remaining. That capped a nine-play, 59-yard drive engineered by reserve 
quarterback Terry Payne, who replaced starter Paul Schulte in the second 
quarter. Schulte left the game with bruised ribs and didn't return, but the 
injury is not considered serious. . . . Titan receiver Kerry Reed caught nine 
passes for 77 yards. . . . For the third time this season, Titan kicker Phil 
Nevin missed a 32-yard field-goal attempt, this one coming on the final play of 
the third quarter. It's the shortest distance Nevin has missed from in his 
college career. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State rover Anthony Washington had 2 1/2 quarterback sacks.

TURNOVERS TURN IT FOR RANCHO SANTIAGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago College realized a five-touchdown windfall because Golden West 
was careless with the football Saturday in a Mission Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago intercepted five passes and recovered a fumble in a 33-9 
victory at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West led, 9-6, early in the third quarter, when its troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Gonzales intercepted a pass by Golden West quarterback David Brunet and 
returned it 23 yards to the Rustler 10. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Estrus Crayton scored on a one-yard dive to give Rancho 
Santiago a 13-9 lead with 2 minutes 52 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales also had a second-quarter interception that set up the Dons' first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With 13:06 left, Scott Strini intercepted a Brunet pass that had been tipped. 
The turnover gave Rancho Santiago (5-3, 2-1 in the Central Division) a first 
down at its 46, and Crayton capped the eight-play drive with a 10-yard run to 
give Rancho Santiago a 20-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton finished with 106 yards in 20 carries. A 73-yard touchdown run was 
called back because of an illegal-use-of-hands call. The Dons had three 
first-half touchdowns called back because of infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton's two touchdowns give him 20 this season, tying his Rancho Santiago and 
Mission Conference records set last year. 
</P>
<P>
After Crayton's second score, Golden West (5-3, 1-2) switched to quarterback 
Steve Ramirez, but the result was the same -- only quicker. 
</P>
<P>
His first pass was intercepted by Gary Bladow and returned 10 yards for a 
touchdown with 9:02 left to put the Dons up, 26-9. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West, which has lost three of its past four games, wasn't finished 
being kind to defensive strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Brunet came back, only to fumble a snap that linebacker Richard Valenzuela 
recovered at the 11. Valenzuela also had an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Two rushing plays lost six yards, but quarterback Richard Fanti completed 
17-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Trent Julian for a 33-9 lead with 6:50 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a competitive football until those fourth-quarter turnovers," Golden 
West Coach Ray Shackleford said. "We didn't play well after that." 
</P>
<P>
Fanti had given Rancho Santiago a 6-0 lead in the second quarter on a 24-yard 
scramble, when he faked out three defenders and broke two attempted tackles. 
</P>
<P>
After completing his first nine pass attempts for 76 yards, Fanti finished 11 
of 18 for 89 yards. He also rushed for 58 yards in eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
Brunet completed 10 of 20 for 99 yards and four interceptions, two of which 
were tipped by his receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Graff scored Golden West's touchdown on a 25-yard run in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustlers rushed for 206 yards, led by Frank Vaccaro, who had 63. Doug 
Cunningham, coming back after a leg injury sidelined him for a month, had 51 
yards in 10 tries.

MULLIGAN SEES POSITIVES IN EXHIBITION DEFEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine offered something new and something old in its exhibition basketball 
game against High Five America Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McDonald, a 6-foot junior point guard, jumped center against Antwahn 
Nance, 6-9, and won the tip. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler showed off his new, leaner physique, leaping over the press table 
to save a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also clear the Anteaters still haven't worked out all of the kinks 
from a 5-23 1989-90 season, the worst in the school's 25-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine turnovers, 53.1% free-throw shooting and 49 points by High Five's 
Troy Lewis were too much for Irvine, which lost, 127-122, before 1,107 in the 
Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan nevertheless liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged," he said. "We made a million mistakes, and we know that." 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' run-until-you-drop offense looked as if it needed a little work, 
but there is still time before they open for real against UCLA in the Great 
Alaska Shootout Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's fast break and a near-total collapse by High Five, a barnstorming team 
of former college stars fighting drug and alcohol abuse, nearly wiped out a 
21-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"That (running and gunning) is what we're going to do all year," Mulligan said. 
"I'm not going to change. I don't care what anybody says." 
</P>
<P>
Butler -- who has dropped 20 to 25 pounds since last season, according to 
Mulligan -- McDonald and Dylan Rigdon led the comeback for Irvine, which 
trailed, 83-62 less than four minutes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon had a chance to bring Irvine even at 119-all with 1:14 left but made 
only one of two free throws, and that was as close as Irvine got. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who hit all manner of drives to the basket and three-point jumpers, made 
a layup and went four-for-four from the line in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was an All-Big Ten guard at Purdue. He was 16 for 22, including four for 
six on three-pointers, and made 13 of 16 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who injured his left knee in a workout last Sunday and practiced only 
lightly this week, had 24 points to lead Irvine despite playing just 18 minutes 
because of exhaustion and foul trouble. He fouled out with 5:01 left after 
making 11 of 13 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Butler, a 6-7, 245-pound senior center, was asked if he felt quicker 
having shed the extra weight. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you see me dunking out there?" he said. "I feel good about the team. I 
think we're going to be good." 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon had 23 points, McDonald 15 and Jeff Herdman 13 for Irvine, which next 
plays the Finnish National Team Nov. 12.

<P>
Edison High School's Shelley Taylor won her third consecutive Sunset League 
girls' cross-country championship, leading the Chargers to the team title in 
the league meet Saturday at Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a junior, covered the three-mile course in 17 minutes 50 seconds, 
winning by more than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's Juan Ramirez won the boys' race in 15:44. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to push myself a lot today," said Taylor, who, along with Katella's 
Martha Pinto, has been the county's top runner this season. "I was mainly going 
for a good time and wanted to break 17:30, but I'm pretty happy with 17:50." 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams with the best overall record advanced to the Southern 
Section preliminaries next Saturday at Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
Edison won the girls' meet with 31 points, and Ocean View was second with 92. 
Santa Ana finished with the same number of points as Huntington Beach (101), 
but broke the tie with a better sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley won the boys' race with 52 points for its fourth consecutive 
league championship. Santa Ana was second with 76, and Huntington Beach was 
third (78). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, which had a 4-2 dual-meet record to 5-1 for Huntington Beach and 6-0 
for Fountain Valley, advanced to the section preliminaries as the league's No. 
2 team with its finish Saturday. Huntington Beach is No. 3.

SANTA ANA WINS; HILL TIES HILL ON VICTORY LIST

<P>
For Santa Ana's football team, it was just the third victory of the season. But 
for Saints' Coach Dick Hill, it was one of the biggest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana defeated Lynwood, 23-14, in a nonleague game Saturday night at Santa 
Ana Stadium, allowing Hill to tie Herb Hill for most victories by an Orange 
County high school football coach. Dick Hill can break the record if Santa Ana 
defeats Westminster Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Hill has a 191-81-3 career record. Herb Hill was 191-114-11 from 1956 
through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (3-6) used a strong rushing attack that gained 288 yards. Kevin Pola 
had 191 yards on 34 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured we could run the ball against them," said Hill, who was more 
willing to talk about his team's play then his record. "We were certainly going 
to try to run Pola, but we thought the pass would be there if we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Saints didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana started the scoring on its first drive, 67 yards in 14 plays. Pola 
ran one yard for the score, and Gustavo Plasencia added the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
After the Saint defense forced a Lynwood fumble and recovered at the Knight 17, 
Santa Ana wasted little time running the ball in. Robert Tabile finished off a 
six-play drive from the one. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood (4-5) rallied in the second half, beginning with Jock Ingram's 97-yard 
kickoff return for a touchdown. Ingram tied the game when he ran two yards with 
7:34 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine took the lead for good on Plasencia's 48-yard field goal and sealed 
the victory when Tabile capped an 11-play, 67-yard drive by running 16 yards 
with 1:16 left. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

ON THE PREP PATH: DIABLOS' LEBRETON ON THE FIELD: 'I'D BE HONORED TO SMASH YOU, 
SIR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a certain charm in the way Beau LeBreton speaks to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, ma'am," LeBreton, a Mission Viejo defensive end, says in his slight Texas 
drawl. "Thank you, ma'am," and so on. You half expect him to bow before he 
excuses himself. 
</P>
<P>
Such niceties aren't expected from a 17-year-old who's so intense on the 
football field that the Tasmanian Devil looks like a wimp by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Suzy Lundahl, says it's all part of his natural charm. 
</P>
<P>
"Beau has never met a stranger -- he assumes everyone is his friend," Lundahl 
said. "His second-grade teacher said, 'I have never met such a natural-born 
politician. Beau can't cross the room to sharpen his pencil without saying "Hi, 
how ya doin'?" or seeing if someone else wants their pencil sharpened.' " 
</P>
<P>
Friday night against El Toro, Beau observed no niceties. His tremendously 
aggressive play (three sacks, a tipped pass) helped Mission Viejo defeat El 
Toro, 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his objective for the game, Beau turned serious. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the top-rated quarterback in the county, ma'am," he said. "That's 
what we keyed on, that's what we had to stop." 
</P>
<P>
While El Toro's Rob Johnson, the quarterback in question, wasn't shut down 
totally -- he completed 16 of 31 passes for 215 yards -- he was snuffed at 
critical moments. 
</P>
<P>
With El Toro trailing, 21-9, with less than six minutes left, Johnson faced a 
third and six on the Mission Viejo 17. LeBreton tipped Johnson's pass, and the 
fans at Mission Viejo High School went crazy. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Bob Johnson called a timeout -- his team was going for the score. 
The plan was for Rob Johnson to hook up with any of four receivers in the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
The timeout ended, and Bob Johnson jogged off the field with his fists clenched 
and held up to his chest, a la Rocky Balboa. He gazed skyward -- or at least 
toward the upper bleachers. His expression was of hope, faith and please, God, 
I'll do anything for a touchdown here. 
</P>
<P>
But Beau was ready. Rob Johnson took the snap, and Beau snapped through the 
offensive line, slamming Johnson to the ground. The El Toro players on the 
sidelines hung their heads in disappointment. The El Toro fans began to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo was elated. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the best game ever for me," LeBreton said while wrapping his mother 
in a bear hug. (Unlike El Toro's players, Beau's mom escaped without bruises). 
</P>
<P>
LeBreton said he considers El Toro the easiest game to get psyched for because 
there are negative vibes between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it seems to all be in the helmets," he said. "I'm staring across the 
line, and all I see are the colors in their helmets. . . . El Toro definitely 
gets me pumped up. It's a hate-type of thing. It's really wild. It's something. 
I mean you look at their helmets, you see the colors, and you see El Toro, you 
see the stickers and the stripes on the sides. . . . I don't know, it just sets 
me off." 
</P>
<P>
Beau wanted to wrap up his postgame interview lickety-split. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma'am, is it all right if I go now? You know, ma'am, my friends and I went to 
celebrate. OK? Thank you, ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
He ran off, jumping on every teammate along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Night of the Living Dead, El Toro style? Aside from the early moments of each 
half, El Toro seemed listless Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
And the Charger fans? Well, you know you're in trouble when the players 
practically beg for more vocal support from the crowd, as several did during 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro players started getting on each other as well. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, man!" Brooks Loughry, an El Toro reserve lineman, shouted at his 
grim-looking teammates. "You guys are dead!" 
</P>
<P>
Or at least in shock. That was the preferred theory from Mission Viejo players 
who enjoyed pointing out that the Chargers' season-long No. 1 ranking might 
have gone to their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so big on themselves," Mission Viejo's Marcellus Chrishon said. "I 
feel like they were stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Said LeBreton: "One thing I noticed was they didn't have a lot of poise out 
there. They had letdowns, and Rob was yelling at the offensive line and stuff. 
At that point, you just have to suck it up, show poise, not let things get you 
down." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro tailback Bret Sanders admitted it probably was a case of inflated 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel we became complacent -- we were 8-0, and we got used to winning," 
Sanders said. "Before the Capo Valley game, we were so fired up. But (for 
Mission Viejo), I don't think the intensity level was there in practice this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro fans bled blue and gold after the loss, but the defeat was especially 
painful for Charger senior Danny Maestas. 
</P>
<P>
Maestas, who injured a knee early in the season, then reinjured it two weeks 
ago against Irvine, watched from the sideline in a wheelchair. A six-hour 
surgery to reconstruct his anterior cruciate ligament was completed just three 
hours before game time. A banner reading "We you Danny" hung on the bleachers 
behind Maestas, who wore his letterman's jacket and a blue-and-gold blanket. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really, really tough," said Maestas, a bit dazed from the painkillers 
doctors prescribed for him to take every hour. "I really wanted to be out 
there."

<P>
The grass is always be greener on the other side -- especially if you're from 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's Davidson Field was in fine condition at the beginning of the 
season, but lately, a large section of the midfield has turned brown. Theories 
abound as to how and why. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Athletic Director Eric Tweit classifies the situation as a 
mystery of whodunit proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's pointing fingers at everyone else," Tweit said. "No one will 
officially say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Add Newport Harbor: The Sailors played their homecoming game Thursday night and 
defeated Woodbridge, 25-0. 
</P>
<P>
As in most homecomings, the elegantly dressed and coiffured princesses were 
driven around the stadium track while being introduced to the fans at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Their mode of transportation? Harley Davidson motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, comments on sportsmanship -- or lack of it -- were made in this 
column. One issue touched upon was the tremendous amount of profanity used on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
It was mentioned that Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson -- who seems to be one of 
the worst offenders in the county -- could be introduced to a few alternate 
words to express his anger. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's response? All reporters have been banned from their sideline, 
except for the final five minutes of a game. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Mater Dei's philosophy comes down to this: See no evil, hear no 
evil, but speak any &amp;! 
</P>
<P>
!!!! way you wish.

MAN DIES AFTER SCUFFLE WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man died Saturday in police custody shortly after being clubbed 
with nightsticks by Los Angeles police officers as they arrested him for 
harassing a family in his neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Mayberry, 35, stopped breathing after officers struck him on both arms 
and both legs with batons during a struggle to arrest him, said Lt. William 
Hall of the department's Robbery and Homicide Division. 
</P>
<P>
Police had been called after Mayberry allegedly forced his way into a home in 
the 400 block of Norton Avenue at about 8:30 a.m. Saturday and attacked a 
resident and her son. 
</P>
<P>
Hall added that the arresting officers had "formed the opinion that Mayberry 
was under the influence of an unknown type of narcotic," and that, as a result, 
acted "violent and bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
But several residents in the generally quiet, tree-lined neighborhood said they 
witnessed officers using excessive force in the arrest, and alleged that police 
continued to beat Mayberry after he had submitted to arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"There were half a dozen police over him while he was standing," said Mirriam 
Morales, 35, a resident on Norton Avenue for 11 years. "Then they dropped him 
down on his stomach and they kept swinging their joysticks on him hard, I mean 
really hitting him with those things." 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating the incident and an autopsy has been scheduled to 
determine what caused Mayberry's death, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the officers involved were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Mansour, 13, the older son of the family involved in the incident, said 
Mayberry, a stranger, kicked in the door of their home and told the Mansours 
that he was being chased by assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say who they were, just that they were trying to kill him," Marvin 
said. "Then he told us to call the police to have them come protect him. He 
said he was going to kill us if we didn't call the police." 
</P>
<P>
Before the youth fled the house, he said he saw Mayberry push his mother, 
Margaret, 49, into their bathtub and then grab his brother Johnny, 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like he was really trying to hurt anyone," Marvin said. "He 
seemed more like he was crazy. He kept saying that we had to call the police. 
The whole time it was like he was really scared." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, Hanna Mansour, 44, said at least seven neighbors noticed the 
disturbance and had called police by the time his son fled the house. Three 
police officers arrived within minutes of Mayberry's intrusion into the home, 
the younger Mansour said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who was contacted by Mayberry's relatives after news of the alleged 
police beating began circulating said she talked to more than a dozen neighbors 
who criticized the officers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the neighborhood knew Tracy had a drug problem," the 
attorney, Iris Johnson-Bright, said. "But the way the police decided to deal 
with it has got a lot of people upset.

CRIME: POLICE USE HAND-DRAWN MAP TO LOCATED SKELETON OF WOMAN WHO DISAPPEARED. 
HUSBAND OF VICTIM IS ARRESTED IN LA JOLLA ON SUSPICION OF MURDER.

Using a hand-drawn diagram that led them directly to a makeshift grave, police 
have unearthed the skeleton of a woman who police believe was killed five years 
ago and buried in a plastic bag in the back yard of a Canoga Park house. Police 
have arrested her husband on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jeffrey Hardy, 46, was arrested near his La Jolla area apartment Friday 
and taken to Van Nuys jail, where he was held overnight without bail, said Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Douglas Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was transferred Saturday to an undisclosed hospital because of a heart 
ailment, said Sgt. John Rygh. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives believe the remains found Friday in the 20600 block of Sherman Way 
are of Hardy's wife, Deborah Lynn Hardy, 31, who disappeared in late 1985 or 
early 1986, Miller said. A spokesman for the coroner's office said the results 
of an autopsy will be released this week. 
</P>
<P>
A tip from an unidentified informant led officers to the remains, which were 
buried three feet deep in the back yard of the house the couple rented for six 
months in 1985 on Sherman Way, Miller said. The informant gave police the map. 
</P>
<P>
The informant told detectives that the woman was struck on the head with a 
flashlight during a domestic dispute and eventually buried in the southwest 
corner of the back yard, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy did not file a missing person's report and told friends that his wife had 
run away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Cheree Coyle, the current occupants of the house, said about 20 police 
officers, including a forensics team, spent seven hours Friday digging up their 
back yard and searching their home for evidence of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Coyle, 28, a prop maker for TV and movie studios, said he returned home 
from work early Friday and spent much of the day chatting with detectives, who 
Coyle said revealed details about the crime not available in a press release 
issued Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to comment on the details given by Coyle. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle said police told him that the informant came forward after he was 
arrested on burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
Cheree Coyle, a 27-year-old church secretary, said police had a hand-drawn map 
and easily unearthed the remains using a backhoe. The body had been sprinkled 
with lime and wrapped in heavy plastic, but had not entirely decomposed because 
the plastic prevented water from activating the lime, Bob Coyle said police 
told him. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives removed all the yellow floor tiling in the Coyles' bathroom as part 
of the investigation, Coyle said. Police told him they plan to test the tile 
for blood traces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle said that when he moved into the house four years ago, there was "an 
awful smelling" foot locker, 6 1/2 feet long by 1 1/2 feet wide, in the garage 
that he washed out and used to store tools. Police also removed the foot locker 
Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle said officers also asked him to help them find a tin shed that had been 
on the property when he moved in. Coyle said detectives told him that the shed 
was erected to cover the digging of the grave and then left behind when Hardy 
moved. Coyle had given the shed to a friend in Paso Robles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Tronson, who owns the house, was out of town Saturday and could not be 
reached for comment. Bob Coyle said that Tronson told him that the Hardys 
erected a 10-foot chain-link fence and bought three Doberman pinschers two 
weeks after moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was arrested without incident about 7 p.m. Friday when a van he was 
driving was stopped in the 3800 block of Nobel Drive in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A woman and two children who were with Hardy in the van were taken to the 
Police Department's northern division headquarters, questioned and released, 
Robinson said. They were not considered suspects, he added. Police declined to 
identify the three.

SEVERAL MEASURES WILL SHAPE COUNTY BUDGET FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider the best scenario: If voters are generous on Tuesday, the financially 
strapped Los Angeles County budget could be awash in more than $1 billion in 
new funds provided by a variety of propositions. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health clinics threatened with closure could remain open. Jails would be 
built and expanded. The county's ailing trauma care system would be shored up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, consider the worst: Unless voters approve certain key tax increases and 
bonds, the Board of Supervisors will be faced with cutting $57 million from 
health and mental health programs -- only one week after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the proposed bond measures and tax increases on the ballot, if approved, 
would provide Los Angeles County with money enough to avert closing the clinics 
and upgrade beaches, parks and cultural facilities, among other things, said 
County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of just three measures in particular would contribute to the county 
budget's downward spiral and make tougher Dixon's job of running a huge 
bureaucracy beset with growing demands and shrinking resources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most critical are two measures: State Proposition 134, the so-called 
"nickel-a-drink" tax, and Proposition A, a county-sponsored half-cent increase 
in the local sales tax, Dixon said. They would provide the county with a 
continuing source of money. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in county government agrees that more money is needed. Addressing 
his colleagues' assertions that the county's budget must grow, board Chairman 
Pete Schabarum said, "Baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"This board would be better served in reassessing our priorities rather than 
seeking more revenues," Schabarum said, pointing out that the county's $10.3 
billion budget is bigger than the budget of 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
Months ago, the supervisors voted to continue funding for county health and 
mental health programs even though Gov. George Deukmejian, facing a state 
budget crisis, last summer slashed state funding for those programs. The 
supervisors decided to postpone cuts until after the election in the hope that 
voters would approve the alcohol-tax increase, which would provide Los Angeles 
County with $180 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under alcohol industry-supported Proposition 126, the county is projected to 
receive $34 million a year. But Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Supervisor Ed 
Edelman, said that Proposition 126 provides for the state to distribute the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"If Proposition 126 passes, there is no guarantee that Los Angeles County will 
get one penny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 134 is rejected, the county will be forced to cut $40 million in 
mental health programs, resulting in the closure of most of the 19 county-run 
mental health clinics and forcing 22,000 of the 52,000 mostly low-income 
patients who now receive mental health treatment to go without care, said 
county mental health director Roberto Quiroz. 
</P>
<P>
In neither alcohol tax measure is approved, the county will also cut $17 
million in health services over and above the $7 million in reductions 
implemented in September, officials said. If Proposition 126 passes, the county 
could receive enough money to avert health cuts but not the mental health cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors could cut funding in other areas. But they have been loathe to 
allocate scarce resources to bail out programs such as mental health, which the 
state requires but does not fully fund. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Proposition 134 would provide enough money to avert most of the 
mental health cuts, plus help the county's trauma care network, increase 
alcohol and drug education and treatment programs, expand the sheriff's 
anti-drug programs in the schools and fund sobriety check points, said Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 134 say it would lock into the state budget higher 
levels of spending than the increases it would raise, perhaps leading to other 
tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the county's Proposition A is critical to prevent county-run jails 
from draining funds from other programs. It would raise the sales tax half a 
cent to generate $423 million a year for construction and operation of county 
jails and juvenile detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Jail costs, Dixon said, have soared from $76 million in 1980 to $348 million 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures that would add to the county budget, as well as give cities 
money, include: 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition B, the largest bond measure in county history. It would boost 
property taxes by $817 million to pay for an array of recreational and cultural 
projects. The county would receive $336 million, and the remainder would go to 
cities and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition C is a proposed half-cent increase in the local sales tax to fund 
transit projects. It would raise $400 million annually, of which the 
supervisors would receive about $10 million to improve bus service and 
dial-a-ride service for the elderly and the handicapped. The bulk of the money 
would be distributed by the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 129, sponsored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, would allocate 
$1.2 billion in state funds over an eight-year period for drug enforcement and 
treatment. It also would authorize $740 million in bonds for building jails. 
The Los Angeles County sheriff would receive $36 million a year, which could be 
used to increase sheriff's patrols, according to a spokesman for the campaign. 
The county also would receive $24 million a year for drug education and 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon has opposed this measure, saying it would require "diversion of existing 
state funds from other programs with unknown impact." 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 133, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, is a proposed 
statewide half-cent sales tax increase to fund a four-year, $7.5-billion plan 
to put more police on the streets, expand drug education in the schools and 
provide treatment for drug users. If approved, the measure would provide the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department with $53 million a year. The county 
also would receive $9.6 million a year for more prosecutors, $9.6 million a 
year for more judges, $38.4 million a year for alcohol- and drug-abuse programs 
and $31 million for jails. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 147 is a $225-million state bond that would finance construction 
of county jails and juvenile detention facilities. No specific amount is 
earmarked for Los Angeles County, but Dixon projected that the county would 
receive up to $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 149 is a state park bond. Los Angeles County would receive $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 150 is a state bond for courthouse construction. Los Angeles 
County expects to receive $60 million to $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all the spending measures pass, that still will not solve all of the 
county's problems, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the infusion of new money, we're going to see a continued 
deterioration of our infrastructure and our services," Dixon said. "With it, 
you'll see us hold our own, and maybe improve a little."

SPURS USE A 20-0 AMBUSH TO RUN LAKERS OUT OF TOWN;

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: SAN ANTONIO, WITHOUT ITS STARTING GUARDS, GETS DUNLEAVY ERA OFF 
ON THE WRONG FOOT, 110-99. WORTHY SCORES 35.

SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gone for the moment is the joy of arriving in a city where the locals are 
whooping it up over their heroes, then going out in a jammed arena and creating 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Lakers are in transition. Saturday they found out more about what 
that means. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Dunleavy, taking over for Pat Riley, watched his team grab a 
14-point lead, turn stone cold and topple like an icicle, 110-99, against the 
ambitious San Antonio Spurs in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the Lakers have to suck it up. All that talk around here was 
about the matchup between the team of the '80s and the team of the '90s -- 
guess which was which? -- and the Spurs breaking out their "We Want It Now" 
slogan, but there's nothing the Lakers can do about it this trip. 
</P>
<P>
"They've definitely got a team people are going to have to deal with in the 
'90s," Magic Johnson said, "but so do we. So this is good. We'll be right here 
and I think people know that." 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs got it now, all right, but it wasn't quite what they expected. 
Shortly after fans filed in from a nearby pep rally, they learned they had lost 
both starting guards, Rod Strickland and Willie Anderson, with stress 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
They opened with veteran Paul Pressey and forward Sean Elliott in the 
backcourt, then held their breath and threw in rookie Sean Higgins and career 
disappointment Reggie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Just for old times' sake, the Lakers hit them with a 38-point first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Lakers went 6:07 without a point in the third quarter, looking 
unfamiliar with Dunleavy's new system, to say the least. In 12 scoreless 
possessions, they had six of them (five turnovers, one blocked shot) in which 
they didn't get the ball to the basket. They came in leading, 62-54, and came 
out behind, 74-62, before re-locating the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, you go through a lot of ups and downs," Dunleavy said. "You're going 
good, you're feeling good. They come at you, you're trying to hold 'em off at 
the pass, waiting for the cavalry." 
</P>
<P>
On this team, one man does the bulk of riding to the rescue, but he was 
breaking in a new saddle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (14 points on three-of-10 shooting) is struggling with the offense. 
When it comes time for him to take over the game, or step up to stop an 
opponent's run, he's running new plays, finding himself in different areas of 
the court and trying to figure out how he can go one-on-one from there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a learning game for us," Johnson said. "The difference, James (Worthy) 
is still getting his same shots, but the rest of us are getting different 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I said was going to happen to us. Sam (Perkins) played center the 
whole second half and Sam didn't play center with us in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have to set the table a lot more, by which I mean, get the ball in 
the post, make them double-team and then we kick it out." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers spent the rest of the afternoon in pursuit and to their credit, cut 
the lead to 96-94 on Johnson's three-point shot with 3:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, trailing 98-95, the Lakers cleared a side for Worthy (35 
points), their red-hot gun of the first half when he put Terry Cummings to the 
torch. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Spurs' defense forced him to settle for a pull-up 18-footer off 
the dribble. It missed, the Spurs got the rebound and took off with it. At the 
other end, Cummings dunked over Terry Teagle, was fouled and made the free 
throw. The Lakers were never within five points again. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers dressed in a hurry and flew home, compliments hanging in the air 
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"I look around and you're always trying to adjust to their lineup," Spur Coach 
Larry Brown said. "They've got great players. They've got new players, a new 
coach but I still think they're the team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I look out there, there's Magic, Worthy, Byron Scott, now Terry 
Teagle and Sam Perkins. That's not too shabby." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sam Perkins, the "unspectacular" new Laker, had a terrific debut: 22 points, 10 
rebounds, two of three on three-point shots, two blocks, two steals. . . . 
Perkins played 42 minutes, to starting center Vlade Divac's eight, suggesting 
that the Vlade Experiment may not have a lot of time left in it. Divac scored 
on a three-point play the first time he touched the ball but picked up two fast 
fouls and watched most of the rest of the game. . . . Hot, hot, hot: James 
Worthy made eight of 11 shots in the first period, all from 15 feet or longer. 
He finished with 35 points, so it looks as if there is no carryover from his 
slump in the playoffs against Phoenix. . . . Sean Elliott, a rookie 
disappointment with San Antonio, played guard, scored 20 points and had seven 
rebounds. . . . Elden Campbell played 19 minutes, had four rebounds and three

VIRGINIA: NO. 1 CAVALIERS SEE NATIONAL TITLE HOPES DESTROYED BY LATE GEORGIA 
TECH FIELD GOAL, 41-38.

<P>
Ashen-faced Citrus Bowl scouts filed quietly out of Scott Stadium Saturday, 
their visions of a national championship game gone the moment Scott Sisson's 
field goal sailed through the uprights, giving Georgia Tech a 41-38 victory 
over No. 1 Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-yard kick made it official: Wahoo fever is no more. Those media 
pilgrimages to tiny Charlottesville? Not to worry. Those plane reservations to 
Orlando? Don't bother. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers needed to defeat the 16th-ranked Yellow Jackets, slip past less 
dangerous North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia Tech in the coming weeks, and a 
guaranteed shot at the national title would have been theirs for the taking. In 
fact, a threesome of Citrus Bowl officials were here to tell them that very 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Problem was, Georgia Tech (7-0-1) didn't share that vision. Virginia had the 
ranking, but it didn't have the respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought Virginia was the No. 1 team in the nation because they hadn't 
been tested," Georgia Tech safety Ken Swilling said. "This was their biggest 
test." 
</P>
<P>
Said Virginia center Trevor Ryals: "We had the whole season in our hands and we 
let it slip away." 
</P>
<P>
In an afternoon's time, the Cavaliers (7-1) lost a game, an Atlantic Coast 
Conference championship -- probably, a top-five ranking, a chance to play for a 
national title and maybe as much as a $1 million in bowl money. No doubt the 
Rose and Orange Bowl people are thrilled, as are the undefeated and 
probation-scarred Houston Cougars -- all of whom stand to benefit from the 
wide-open race for No. 1. But to most of the 49,700 who crammed into Scott 
Stadium, Saturday's game will revolve around a single what-if. 
</P>
<P>
What if Virginia Coach George Welsh would have thrown caution to the winds or, 
at the very least, had quarterback Shawn Moore throw the ball to wide receiver 
Herman Moore on fourth-and-goal from the Georgia Tech six-yard line? At the 
time, the Cavaliers trailed, 38-35, with 2:34 to play. A touchdown would put 
them ahead by four points and force Georgia Tech to score a touchdown with only 
one timeout at its disposal. And if the Virginia try failed, the Cavaliers, 
with all three timeouts available, could make the Yellow Jackets start their 
drive at the six. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Welsh had Jake McInerney kick a 23-yard field goal. The tie 
accomplished, Welsh then watched in disbelief as Georgia Tech started at its 
24, drove to the Virginia 20 and kicked the winning field goal with 12 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't think you go for the touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the six," 
Welsh said. "My God, what's your chances of that? I would think 99% of the 
coaches would (kick the field goal)." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Welsh should have been spared the decision. The Cavaliers had 
six chances to score from the six-yard line, but were stopped -- or stopped 
themselves -- each time. An illegal procedure penalty nullified a touchdown 
pass from Shawn Moore to tight end Aaron Mundy. Another illegal procedure call 
pushed the ball back from the one-yard line to the six. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mistakes, Herman Moore was disappointed when Welsh pulled the 
offense on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely wanted to go for it," he said. "I say keep them down deep and 
force them to kick again. But it wasn't up to me." 
</P>
<P>
Moore has a point. He had caught nine passes for 234 yards and one touchdown 
and one two-point conversion. The cornerback guarding him, Curley Day, is 
5-foot-9. Moore is 6-5 and the ACC high jump champion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shawn Moore had passed for a school-record 344 yards, rushed for 
three touchdowns and thrown for another. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew in the back of their heads, they wanted to (go for it)," said Tech 
linebacker Calvin Tiggle, who knocked down the third-down pass that preceded 
the tying field goal. "I'm glad (they didn't). It was a relief, a big relief." 
</P>
<P>
Equally happy with the decision was Swilling, the All-ACC safety who had 
practiced twice in the last three weeks because of an ankle injury. Swilling 
missed tackle after tackle Saturday and was burned by Herman Moore on a 36-yard 
touchdown. Rather than have to defend Moore again, Swilling could retire to the 
bench and watch Shawn Jones, Georgia Tech's sophomore quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whom a defender should fear more -- Shawn Moore, the Heisman candidate, 
or Jones -- Swilling didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably Shawn Jones," he said. "He has a great ability to turn busted plays 
into something big. That's the ability that really scares me about him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tech Coach Bobby Ross: "Hey, our Shawn is a great quarterback, too." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia knows. The Cavaliers watched Jones lead the Yellow Jackets to scores 
in four of their five second-half possessions. He outrushed the more celebrated 
Shawn, and threw for two touchdowns and 257 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, Jones was three for three for 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sisson) said, 'Just get it inside the 35 and we'll take it from there,' " 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones did better than that. He moved the Yellow Jackets to inside the 25-yard 
line. He then used Georgia Tech's final timeout, allowing Sisson the luxury of 
an unhurried kick. Virginia countered with several timeouts of its own, all 
designed to make Sisson nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to stay on the field and let them freeze me, so I tried to go 
over and talk to the guys in the huddle," Sisson said. "Then I went over and 
talked to Coach Ross." 
</P>
<P>
That done, Sisson jogged back onto the field and with the swing of his right 
leg, pushed Virginia out of the national championship equation. Afterward, Ross 
gave the game ball to his father. Then he gave his team a day off. It earned 
it.

HUSKIES ACHIEVE NO. 1 GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: DON JAMES' TEAM IS GOING TO ROSE BOWL. IT ALSO HAS SIGHTS ON 
NATIONAL TITLE.

Thanks to Virginia and Nebraska, coach Don James has a new whip to use on the 
Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Virginia and No. 3 Nebraska were beaten Saturday, reducing by two 
the short list of unbeaten teams and greatly enhancing the national 
championship aspirations of once-beaten teams such as Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," Washington Coach Don James said when told that Virginia and 
Nebraska lost. "It's good to have a shot at the national championship. That's a 
big motivator not to let up." 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-ranked Huskies (8-1) clinched a spot in the Rose Bowl with a 54-10 
defeat of No. 23 Arizona. Mark Brunell passed for two touchdowns and ran for a 
third, and Greg Lewis ran for 100 yards for the ninth time this season as the 
Huskies earned their first trip to Pasadena since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a better team in the country, I'm anxious to see them," Arizona 
Coach Dick Tomey said. "They made a believer out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Washington players learned they clinched a Rose Bowl trip when No. 22 Oregon 
came back to beat UCLA, 28-24, only minutes after the Huskies' victory over the 
Wildcats (6-3, 4-3) and after most of the crowd of 70,111 had left Husky 
Stadium. Washington's band was on the field and struck up "California Here I 
Come." 
</P>
<P>
Washington earned its 11th Rose Bowl trip and fourth in James' 16-year coaching 
career. James took the Huskies to Pasadena in the 1977, 1980 and 1981 seasons. 
The Huskies are going to their 12th bowl game under James and 11th in the past 
12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It was Washington's fifth victory in a row, all in the Pac-10, since losing at 
Colorado, 20-14, on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have outscored their six Pac-10 victims, 263-64. 
</P>
<P>
Beno Bryant was another Washington standout against Arizona, scoring on a 
70-yard punt return for the Huskies' second touchdown in the first quarter and 
a 73-yard run for Washington's seventh touchdown in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell, a sophomore, completed 11 of 18 passes for 169 yards, including 
scoring pass plays of 47 yards to Mario Bailey and 12 yards to tight end Aaron 
Pierce in the second quarter. He scored on a two-yard run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a senior, gained 103 yards in 22 carries, including a five-yard 
touchdown run for the Huskies' first touchdown in the opening quarter. It was 
the 14th 100-yard rushing game of his career and gives him 2,628 yards -- 464 
shy of Joe Steele's school record. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's defense, best in the nation against the run, held Arizona to 94 
yards in 48 rushes and recovered three Wildcat fumbles.

NEBRASKA: NO. 3 CORNHUSKERS SUFFER FIRST LOSS AS COLORADO TAKES INSIDE TRACK 
FOR TRIP TO ORANGE BOWL, 27-12.

Colorado tailback Eric Bieniemy was distraught after losing his fourth fumble 
in Saturday's Big Eight showdown against No. 3 Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated, disgusted, you name it," Bieniemy said. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Bill McCartney pulled Bieniemy aside to console him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that nobody felt worse than he did, but he's got to cover up the 
football better," McCartney said. "I told him he had to rebound from that 
adversity." 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy rebounded by scoring four touchdowns in the fourth quarter as the 
Buffaloes recovered from a 12-0 deficit to defeat the previously unbeaten 
Cornhuskers, 27-12, before a sellout crowd of 76,464 at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado fans bombarded the field with oranges after the No. 9 Buffaloes (8-1-1 
overall and 5-0 in the conference) moved closer to their second consecutive 
trip to the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we played on emotion last year, but they can't say that this year," 
Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan said. "We beat them solely on talent. We 
scored 27 points in the fourth quarter. That's not emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska (8-1, 4-1) more than likely had its hopes for a national title wiped 
out. Colorado probably can't win it all, either, since the Buffaloes already 
have their fifth-down victory over Missouri, a loss to Illinois and a tie with 
Tennessee. But McCartney thinks victories over Oklahoma and Nebraska can't 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's leading rusher, Bieniemy rushed for 137 yards in 38 carries 
against the nation's No. 1 rushing defense as Colorado erupted for 27 points in 
the final 15 minutes. It was the most points scored against Nebraska in the 
fourth quarter since 1945, when the school began keeping records. Colorado had 
122 yards in total offense in the fourth quarter, while Nebraska had minus 
four. 
</P>
<P>
After gaining only 45 yards and fumbling three times in the first half, 
Bieniemy rebounded by rushing for 98 yards in the second half, including 
touchdowns of one, two, three and five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Did Bieniemy have trouble holding onto the ball because of the miserable 
conditions on a frigid, wet, windy afternoon? 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was slippery, but there's no excuse for fumbling," Bieniemy said. "It 
was my fault. I tried gloves, spit on my hands, but nothing worked. I'm glad I 
had the opportunity to make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 12-0, after two field goals and a a 46-yard touchdown play from 
Mickey Joseph to tight end Johnny Mitchell, Hagan completed two passes for 49 
yards as Colorado drove 81 yards in 10 plays to pull within 12-7 on Bieniemy's 
one-yard touchdown plunge. 
</P>
<P>
On first and 16 at his 23, Hagan hit wide receiver Rico Smith with a 30-yard 
pass to the Nebraska 47. After Bieniemy picked up 24 yards in three carries and 
Hagan added three more on a keeper, Hagan hit wide receiver Mike Pritchard with 
a 19-yard pass to the one to set up Bieniemy's first touchdown, which cut the 
score to 12-7 with 14:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over at the Colorado 47 after forcing Nebraska to punt, the Buffaloes 
drove 53 yards to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan hit Pritchard, who had three catches for 90 yards, with a 34-yard pass to 
the Nebraska 11 on the second play of the drive, but the drive stalled at the 
two. Facing a fourth-and-one situation, Colorado tried to draw Nebraska 
offside, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
After calling time out to set up a play, McCartney decided to give the ball to 
Bieniemy, who hurdled into the end zone to give Colorado a 13-12 lead with 8:37 
remaining. The Buffaloes went for a two-point conversion, but Hagan's pass fell 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's defense forced Nebraska to punt from its 28 on the ensuing series, 
but Cornhusker Coach Tom Osborne tried a gimmick play. Instead of snapping the 
ball to punter Mike Stigge, the ball went to fullback Tim Johnk, who was 
blocking for Stigge. But Colorado linebacker Rob Hutchins stopped Johnk one 
yard short of a first down, giving Colorado the ball at the Nebraska 30. 
</P>
<P>
The fake punt seemed to be an admission that Osborne didn't have any faith in 
the ability of his defense to stop Colorado's offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to see that we weren't stopping them very well," Osborne said. "I 
don't know if it was premature or not, but I felt like we could run a fake punt 
on them." 
</P>
<P>
After Colorado got the ball at the 30, Bieniemy carried four times in the 
five-play drive, scoring from three yards out to give Colorado a 20-12 lead 
with 4:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
After Nebraska turned the ball over on downs at its 10 on the next series, 
Colorado needed only three plays to score, with Bieniemy getting his fourth 
touchdown from five yards out.

Former Denver Nugget trainer Robert (Chopper) Travaglini is being investigated 
by the NBA for a possible association with an organized crime figure, a 
published report said. 
</P>
<P>
Travaglini, 58, who announced his retirement Thursday after 14 years with the 
Nuggets, was seen with Paul (Fat Paulie) Villano, the Rocky Mountain News 
reported in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Lt. Ed Hansen, commander of the Denver Police 
Intelligence Section, confirmed that the two were seen at a restaurant near 
McNichols Arena about three weeks ago. The paper said that Villano, 62, is a 
member of the Smaldone crime family and has an extensive gambling record. 
</P>
<P>
NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Hansen said Villano is under surveillance and said 
he is on parole for federal convictions that included loan sharking and 
possessing an illegal firearms silencer.

EARNHARDT SETS HIS SIGHTS ON MARTIN AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: THREE-TIME WINSTON CUP CHAMPION TRAILS BY 45 POINTS GOING INTO 
TODAY'S RACE AT PHOENIX.

<P>
Mark Martin, a quiet young man from Batesville, Ark., who has a perpetually 
puzzled look about him, and Dale Earnhardt, a tough-talking, hard-driving, 
second-generation driver from Mooresville, N.C., are the only ones left chasing 
NASCAR's $1-million champion's pot after 27 of 29 Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 31, has won three races and is after his first championship. Earnhardt, 
38, has won eight times and is after his fourth title. 
</P>
<P>
But the consistent Martin has a 45-point lead going into today's $550,000 race 
of 312 miles around the low-banked mile oval at Phoenix International Raceway. 
It is a substantial lead, but not insurmountable with the Atlanta Journal 500 
remaining on Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine what we could do differently that could help us win," said 
Martin, driver of the No. 6 Ford Thunderbird prepared by Jack Roush. "We always 
race to finish and we always race to win. We can't change anything. If we could 
we would have done it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt noted that he was 109 points behind Rusty Wallace when he came to 
Phoenix last year and lost the championship by only 12. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can pick up a point or two, or even if we stay even, I'll feel good 
about going to Atlanta," said Earnhardt, who drives the black No. 3 Chevrolet 
Lumina owned and prepared by Richard Childress. "I'm going to race him hard 
both places, and what'll happen will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt will start in the second row today, behind pole-sitter Rusty Wallace, 
last year's Winston Cup champion. Martin will be two rows back, in eighth 
starting position. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighth is fine," Martin said. "It's a lot better than 21st." He started 21st 
two weeks ago at Rockingham. 
</P>
<P>
One difference in this season from others is that there have been no harsh 
words nor battered equipment in the season-long Earnhardt-Martin 
confrontations, such as marked Earnhardt's past feuds with Darrell Waltrip and 
Geoff Bodine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've raced pretty hard all season, close enough to swap some paint, but I 
think it's been a positive fight," Earnhardt said. "Probably what set the tone 
for our racing this year was the race we had at each other last year at Dover. 
He raced me clean. He raced me hard but clean. We got through it and I've raced 
him with mutual respect since then. That racing at Dover was some of the best 
you'll ever see." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt and Martin, who was seeking his first Winston Cup race victory at the 
time, exchanged the lead seven times in the last 63 laps before Earnhardt won 
by .28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Martin: "A lot of people asked me last year, 'Why didn't you knock Dale 
off the road at Dover and get your first win?' I had some people say, 'He would 
have done the same thing to you.' Whatever, but that would have been 
short-sighted. That would have changed the complexion of what we're doing this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Both are coming into today's race after two disappointing performances. 
</P>
<P>
Two races ago, at Charlotte, Earnhardt's crew messed up a pit stop that cost 
him eight laps. 
</P>
<P>
"We miscommunicated on pit road and the crew loosened the left-side lug nuts in 
preparation for a four-tire change," he said. "They changed the right sides, 
dropped the jack and I left, without waiting for the left sides. When I got to 
the end of pit road, the left-side tires came off and there I sat. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of it was that Mark had engine trouble, running the last third 
of the race on seven cylinders. Instead of us having a solid race and gaining 
points -- maybe even taking over the lead -- we ended up losing points." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt finished 25th, Martin 14th. 
</P>
<P>
"We just missed the chassis set-up at Charlotte, and missed it again (in the 
next race) at Rockingham," Martin said. "We just guessed wrong all the way 
around. Luckily for us, and strangely enough, the exact same thing happened to 
Earnhardt in the last race." 
</P>
<P>
At Rockingham, Earnhardt finished 10th, Martin 11th. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't neat, but at least we got out of there with four points," Earnhardt 
said. "Now we've got to make sure nothing gets messed up here. We can't make 
any more mistakes if we want to keep the pressure on Mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Roush and Mark Martin are tough cookies and they won't give up. Their 
team has hardly missed a beat all season." 
</P>
<P>
Roush already has one championship this year. He owns the Mercury Cougar that 
Dorsey Schroeder drove to the International Motor Sports Assn. GTO title. That 
was Roush's 20th road-racing championship.

Martin's consistency has helped offset Earnhardt's greater victory total. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who is in only his fourth full Winston Cup season, has 16 top five 
finishes and 21 top 10 finishes thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Both feel confident about racing at Phoenix on a D-shaped oval much different 
from the high banks where they do most of their high-speed racing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Martin: "We had a good race here last year when we led three times, once 
late in the day. In fact, we ran the tires off the car trying to win but (Bill) 
Elliott and (Terry) Labonte got around us and we wound up third. We know now 
that what we had in the car at that particular race and taking into 
consideration what we have learned, that if we could run that same race over, 
we'd do much better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Earnhardt: "To me, Phoenix is a big, sweeping flat race track. I enjoy it. 
I ran pretty good here last year and the year before." Earnhardt finished sixth 
last year and 11th in 1988, the year that Phoenix replaced Riverside 
International Raceway on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Martin has tradition on his side. No driver has ever come from farther than one 
point behind in the final two races to win the championship.

NEWSWIRE: AGENT: BASEBALL OWNERS AGREE TO PAY $280 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball owners have agreed to pay players $280 million to settle the collusion 
cases, a player agent said Saturday. But the head of management's labor wing 
and a union lawyer denied a settlement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Moss, the former general counsel for the union who represents several 
dozen players, said Saturday that clubs had agreed to the payment as 
compensation for their conspiracy against free agents after the 1985, 1986 and 
1987 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moss said 16 players -- a group that includes Jack Clark, Jack 
Morris, Dave Smith and Gary Gaetti -- would be be granted new-look free agency 
as part of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connor, head of management's Player Relations Committee, would not 
discuss numbers or the new-look free agency, but said discussions had 
intensified although a deal had not been agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Fehr, a union lawyer and brother of union head Donald Fehr, said "it 
appears now that there is the possibility of a settlement" but said "it will 
probably be at least a month" until it could be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
A $280-million payment would amount to $10,769,230 for each of the 26 clubs, by 
far the largest payment made by teams to players in the history of sports. 
</P>
<P>
The collusion cases were filed by the union after teams departed from past 
practice and in October 1985 began shunning free agents. Arbitrator Thomas 
Roberts found the owners guilty of collusion following the 1985 season and 
arbitrator George Nicolau found them guilty after the 1986 and 1987 seasons.

Kudos to Bob Sipchen on "Baby Insane and the Buddha." It was a fascinating, 
insightful and emotional piece. 
</P>
<P>
Getting inside the minds and hearts of gang members is the only, ultimate 
solution to this national malaise, and I appreciate your letting us know how 
Birse did it in San Diego.

MAURICE SENDAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been a librarian in a public library for almost 20 years ("The Dark World 
of Maurice Sendak," by Paul Ciotti, Sept. 16). In my experience the only Sendak 
book that children consistently ask for is "Where the Wild Things Are." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his other work seems to attract more adult attention because the 
illustrations are puzzling and enigmatic and hint at a darker side to life. I 
have always assumed that the sexual symbolism was read into his work by anxious 
adults, but after reading this article I'm not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Sendak is, however, an entertaining and amusing speaker. When I saw him in a 
program with Dr. Seuss in San Diego and at Simmons College in Boston, he came 
across as a dedicated professional, wholly immersed in the world of art and 
music and very possibly difficult to work with because he is a consummate 
perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
Your article was particularly intriguing because he seemed to reveal more of 
himself than he usually does, and maybe even more than some of us wanted to 
know.

It's about time there has been something written to tell people how hard gang 
life is on its members and how most, if given an opportunity, a genuine 
opportunity, would not be involved. 
</P>
<P>
They are just children, most of them hardened by a life many of us couldn't 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
As an African-American, I would like to see and read more about real-life gang 
success stories. I would like to say to Baby Insane, if he should read this: 
Hang in there, little brother. Stay on the straight and narrow, and remember 
there will be many of us who are hoping and praying you continue your new life 
successfully.

<TEXT>
<P>
The latest entry in Hollywood's environmental sweepstakes: "The Day of Two 
Suns," an adventure film based on the life of Greenpeace co-founder and 
chairman David McTaggart. Seattle-based producer Rick Stevenson ("Some Girls"), 
who is raising hometown financing to make the feature, says that McTaggart "is 
almost like a true-life Indiana Jones character." 
</P>
<P>
Rupert Walters' script chronicles McTaggart's transformation from right-wing 
tycoon to eco-activist. The film would re-create a series of confrontations 
between his Rainbow Warrior trawler and the French navy, including one -- 
featuring an earlier Greenpeace boat -- that caused the French government to 
stop atmospheric nuclear testing in 1975. McTaggart has script input, but not 
approval, Stevenson says. 
</P>
<P>
Carolco Pictures has rights to another Rainbow Warrior project, "Warriors of 
the Rainbow," based on a book by Robert Hunter, a Greenpeace co-founder. 
Stevenson, who's partnered with executive producer Danny Wilson, says he's not 
concerned about competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We support any project about the environment," he says. "It's too important an 
issue to get territorial about." Patrick Goldstein

Jimmy Santiago Baca, who taught himself to read and write while in prison and 
went on to have six books of poetry published, is making his debut as a 
screenwriter. The project is "Blood In . . . Blood Out," in development at New 
Visions Pictures under producer Taylor Hackford, who co-produced the Ritchie 
Valens bio, "La Bamba" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Baca is co-writing with Jeremy Iacone. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the barrio of East L.A., "Blood In . . ." traces the lives of three 
boyhood friends, one of whom becomes a cop, the second a promising artist and 
the third a convict who becomes a powerful member of a notorious prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
Hackford, who will produce and direct, declined to discuss the project. But a 
source tells us that "Blood In" could be the first of back-to-back films -- 
with a "Blood In . . . Part II" continuing the characters' saga. 
</P>
<P>
Hackford and some of the crew members have been scouting locations in San 
Antonio, which could "double" for East L.A. (as it did in the film "Lost 
Angels"). Pat H. Broeske

BALZER ON WINE: MORE FROM ARROWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ON THE ROSTER OF WINEMAKERS enjoying international fame, there are about 10 
from Europe, one or two from Germany and about a dozen from California. And 
Richard Arrowood of Sonoma County is among this select few. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowood startled the wine world during his beginnings at Chateau St. Jean in 
the '70s by being the first to release vineyard-designated Chardonnays -- made 
with grapes from vineyards that were identified on the wine label. 
</P>
<P>
When the Japanese wine and spirits company Suntory bought Chateau St. Jean for 
$40 million in 1984, it was assumed by many observers that Arrowood would 
remain at the helm. He did. His production of the legendary, award-winning 
Chardonnays had made him one of the winery's chief assets, which Keizo Saji, 
Suntory's wine-loving president, thoroughly understood. 
</P>
<P>
Suntory and Arrowood developed a synergistic relationship, one so close that in 
1987 Suntory helped Arrowood open his own winery, Arrowood Vineyards and 
Winery. It led him to lending sources that allowed him and his wife, Alis, to 
finance their venture as sole proprietors. (Arrowood remains a consultant at 
Chateau St. Jean.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Chateau St. Jean's, Arrowood's wines are a blend of grapes from a 
variety of vineyards, not merely one. 
</P>
<P>
The Arrowood 1988 Chardonnay ($18.75) is produced from grapes of different 
clones selected from seven ranches in three Sonoma County viticultural regions. 
The Arrowood 1987 Cabernet Sauvignon ($22) is from five grape varieties from 13 
vineyards, all vineyard lots separately fermented and aged before blending. 
"Wines are not made in the cellars but in the vineyards," Arrowood says. 
</P>
<P>
The flavors in the Chardonnay are lush, supple yet crisp, suggesting ripe 
pears, vanilla and spice, with floral overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowood Cabernet Sauvignon is a brilliant, deep ruby, of almost chewy 
substance, gaining bouquet intrigue from five varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. There are suggestions of black 
cherry, boysenberry and even chocolate. It's ready to drink now, but time will 
enhance the wonders. Robert Lawrence Balzer

<TEXT>
<P>
Shearer's blast at public schools included a little throwaway line that 
teaching was once the province of women too squeamish for nursing. His 
dismissal of a generation of female teachers, as if they were the least 
ambitious career women of their time, seems to me to overlook the very heart of 
our present-day education crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Public schooling in the 1930s and '40s rested on the bedrock abilities of 
talented, intelligent and, indeed, ambitious but underpaid women who had almost 
no other career choices open to them besides teaching school. By Shearer's 
time, the standard may have been two good teachers per school, as he says. But 
I was one of the fortunate children of the earlier era. In ordinary public 
schools, in "melting pot" neighborhoods, we learned not only reading, writing 
and arithmetic but history and geography and spelling and music. In fourth 
grade, we all learned to read music as a matter of course, as part of a good 
basic education, taught by our classroom teacher, not by a "specialist" brought 
in for "enrichment." The caliber of our teachers was so high, we were all 
enriched every day, by the simple process Shearer laments: teaching something 
one knows to someone who doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we find the way and the will to deal with the appalling problems that 
swamp our public schools today, we will never restore the quality of teaching 
to that of 50 years ago, unless and until the profession of teaching offers the 
income, status and working conditions that bright, multitalented, competent and 
ambitious women, as well as men, now command in other fields.

Shearer doesn't seem to realize that a school is only as good as the community 
around it. Unfortunately, parents just don't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has been in elementary schools lately would see that the teachers 
are considered not educators but day-care providers. Children are often dropped 
off at school 45 minutes before school begins -- when there is no adult 
supervision -- and left to roam after school until parents return from work. 
</P>
<P>
In short, we do not need people such as Shearer who sit around and complain 
about public schools. We need people to get involved. Join the PTA, run for the 
school board, or vote; the choice is yours whether or not our schools will 
succeed.

Harry Shearer (Man Bites Town, " 'A' Is for Awful," Sept. 16) claims that the 
only individuals who are in our public schools today are "people who have no 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Let me correct him. Speaking for myself and many fellow colleagues, we have 
chosen to remain teachers because we care about America's future and wish to 
contribute to our nation's success. We have not given up to find work 
elsewhere. Unlike Shearer, we have chosen to stay and fight.

I took time to read this "awful" attack against the public school system and 
its teachers before I spent: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours grading papers and working on report cards. 
</P>
<P>
2. Three hours preparing weekly lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
3. Two hours filling in referrals for psychological screening of potentially 
gifted and learning disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
4. One hour writing communiques to parents. 
</P>
<P>
During my "vacation" I will attend the California Reading Assn. Conference, put 
in time at my region office and take a couple of in-service classes. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not one of two teachers in my school who are "good"; I'm one of at least 
30.

*** PET SHOP BOYS "Behavior" EMI 
</P>
<P>
"How can you expect to be . . . taken seriously?" the Pet Shoppers ask in one 
song on what is by far the British duo's most ambitious album, taking great 
care to make the tricky rhyme of be and serious-ly sound effortless. 
</P>
<P>
It's precisely that obsession with putting complex emotions into a simple, 
seductive pop framework that has made the best of this pair's witty, 
sophisticated music so exhilarating: a sort of thinking man's ABBA. 
</P>
<P>
But that same pop sleight-of-hand tends to make the Pet Shop Boys' singles more 
enticing than their albums. 
</P>

The high-tech balance of innocent, Phil Spector-inspired melodic expanse and 
icy, Roxy Music-influenced sentimental regret is a difficult one -- and the 
team of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe (who perform a mini-show on Tuesday at the 
Mayan Club) isn't always up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
A few tracks here -- notably "So Hard" and "The End of the World," two more 
dips into the sea of heartbreak -- reach for the emotional peaks of such 
earlier Pet Shop gems as "What Have I Done to Deserve This" and "Always on My 
Mind." 
</P>
<P>
But these peppy highlights also spoil us, leaving the occasional lapses and the 
forays into slower tempos flat by comparison. That's why the Boys' 12-inch 
singles are especially effective. They allow you to hear the best songs over 
and over, in various mixes, without the lapses. ROBERT HILBURN

** 1/2 GARTH BROOKS "No Fences" Capitol 
</P>
<P>
Garth Brooks' 1989 debut album was not only a hit in country circles, but 
climbed the pop charts with surprising ease -- especially for one whose sound 
is thoroughly traditional. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma native's follow-up has been doing a similar leap-frog up the pop 
and country charts. 
</P>
<P>
This one is a considerable improvement artistically, but more because of the 
weaknesses of the first -- which sank musically under the weight of one 
hopelessly melodramatic song after another -- than because of the modest yields 
of the second. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fences' " best moments, Brooks' woody baritone suggests several lifetimes 
of hard living. And he reveals a canny sense of style in a witty swing 
treatment of the Fleetwoods' sappy old hit "Mr. Blue." Still, the album suffers 
overall from as many predictable comeuppances to wrongdoers and rewards for 
do-gooders as an old Gene Autry movie. Give this sophomore effort a split 
decision for a few steps in the right direction and the promise it holds for 
its successor. RANDY LEWIS

RECORD RACK: WHITNEY HOUSTON'S DARING NEW MOVE?; 
</P>
<P>
ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

** 1/2 WHITNEY HOUSTON "I'm Your Baby Tonight" Arista 
</P>
<P>
Houston has always liked to dance -- with somebody who loves her, if we 
remember correctly -- but until now even her most upbeat numbers had more of a 
light-handed pop touch than a hard-core R&amp;B jackhammer attack. No more. 
</P>
<P>
For three key selections on her third album, Houston has hired hot producing 
team L.A. Reid &amp; Babyface to pump up her formerly less-than-formidable 
dance tracks. Houston's last album sold so well and produced such a phenomenal 
string of hit singles that any tampering with the formula has to be considered 
much more daring than desperate, to the extent that it pushes some of the 
"adult contemporary" pop aside. 
</P>
<P>
How does it work? With the lead track and first single, "I'm Your Baby 
Tonight," just swimmingly. It's a swooning ballad of complete romantic 
acquiescence, with the beat magnified to dance-floor level -- a memorable song 
charming enough to click arranged in any number of genres, but especially 
seductive done up with that energy. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else on the album quite approaches that immediate peak -- not the other 
Reid &amp; Babyface numbers, and especially not the standard ballads. The irony 
is that the dance tunes are most exciting, but could just as easily be backing 
tracks for En Vogue; the ballads show her talent off to greater effect, yet are 
written with foremost banal anonymity. Star contributions by Stevie Wonder 
(singing a duet) and Luther Vandross are engaging, if far from classic. The 
question still remains: Is Houston a great empty vessel? CHRIS WILLMAN

** 1/2 CLINT BLACK "Put Yourself in My Shoes" RCA 
</P>
<P>
Black's 2-million-selling debut album last year presented a newcomer who seemed 
more than just another wide grin under a wide brim -- though he proudly sports 
both. Not only could he sing real purdy, but he could write, with songs such as 
"Killin' Time" offering new twists on the old bar-stool philosophizing and 
straying from the Strait and narrow path. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of staking out his own niche with this follow-up, the Texan strives 
too hard to be all things to all fans. He's a honky-tonk swinger here, a 
restless balladeer there, a working stiff, a lover . . . never just Clint 
Black. He's capable of keen observations and neat turns of phrases, but often 
settles for such things as "No man is an island, but I'm still all alone" -- 
one in a sea of nautical cliches in the Jimmy Buffett-like "Gulf of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
When he hits, he hits high: "The Old Man" is an impressive meditation on 
mortality, with Black musing, "Will I ever be the old man who's too far gone?" 
But more often the album hinges on the music (expertly executed, but there's 
not a lick that's not recycled) and Black's voice (he's good, but hardly the 
pure singer that, say, Randy Travis is). And that leaves pretty much just the 
grin and the brim. STEVE HOCHMAN

The comments defining the moviemakers' primary audience as the "under-25 age 
group" seem to more reflect their decision to play to that group than the fact 
that anyone over 25 is less interested and will spend less money to go to the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the decrease in interest among those of us in that category is because 
Hollywood doesn't try for something beyond violence, motor car chases, 
bed-hopping, etc. There are some really good films, but one has to be on the 
alert and search. That's where the critic comes in.

THEY GIVE FRANKLIN LESS THAN A 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the movie critics in town whose recommendations are suspect, the worst 
offender is television's Gary Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that Franklin gave rave reviews sparingly, but it seems as though 
half the full- and double-page ads for major movies now feature a quote from 
Franklin calling some movie "a 10" or "10 plus." 
</P>
<P>
Because we all know that barely a dozen movies a year truly are that good, it 
is ludicrous to believe Franklin when he implies that so many films are among 
the greatest of all time. 
</P>
<P>
His obvious zeal for getting his name in print destroys his credibility.

Bad criticism is just disorganized thinking. The best review I ever read was 
composed of only two paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
The writer first described the film's plot, character relationships and theme, 
objectively and without judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his strong opinion of the work, I felt I knew exactly what happened on 
the screen and could judge for myself whether I wanted to pay to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Good critics should describe the film, then describe their reaction to it 
separately and completely.

SCREENING OUT THE TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some newspapers or TV network, someone, has got to have the guts to perform a 
fundamental classification even before a review is written. Films that are 
blatant in their profit motive must not be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
These would include 99% of all movies that are into their third sequel or 
beyond. It would include Steven Seagal movies, death movies, teen-age murder 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
I admit the call could be a bit complicated, particularly if we define the 
movie business as fundamentally a business. But we could at least recognize the 
semblance of an honest effort or an attempt toward integrity, and we could 
reward those efforts with a review. The others would not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Film criticism is, after all, part of the total process in the evolution of 
film art. Film critics adulterate that process by reviewing waste material.

IF OLD MOTHER HUBBARD were to go to Bobbi Robins' cupboards, she'd find them 
anything but bare. Her decorative custom-designed cabinets are painted with 
floral, folk-art and trompe l'oeil designs -- or just about anything else her 
clients ask for. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of decorating such utilitarian items as furniture has a long 
history, Robins' cabinets are often put to distinctively 20th-Century uses: 
housing for TVs, VCRs and CD players. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to take something from a secondhand-furniture shop and create 
a fabulous piece," Robins says. To provide a textured background on a new or 
stripped piece of furniture, she uses ragging, sponging, marbleizing and 
"parchmenting." She then paints on her design, using acrylic water-based 
paints. 
</P>
<P>
The one-of-a-kind finished product may feature whimsical trompe l'oeil 
bookshelves, stylized floral designs, or hearts and flowers reminiscent of 
Pennsylvania Dutch patterns. She also paints kitchen cabinets, walls and other 
pieces. Prices range from $150 for a small piece to $3,000 for a large cabinet.

UNDERWEAR OVER ALL

V. M. 18 IS ITALIAN for X-rated (vietato ai minori di 18 anni). It's also the 
name of one of burgeoning La Brea Avenue's new high-style shops. 
</P>
<P>
But the under-outerwear featured there -- inspired by Italian peasants with 
'90s panache -- is not X-rated. V. M. 18, the brainchild of Italian designer 
Pierluigi Palumbo and his partner, Eduardo Torres, presents new styles to be 
worn in the great outdoors, for exercising, swimming, bicycling or simply 
making a street statement. "You can hide them or show them to everybody," 
Palumbo says. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbo admits to receiving wide smiles from Abruzzi village housewives while 
conducting his research -- asking to view the family's undergarments. "For 
them, it (underwear) is a practical thing; they don't know how beautiful these 
items are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The garments are made of natural fabrics of cotton and linen, and colors range 
from black, gray and oatmeal to pastel blue and pink. Designed as underwear, 
the old-fashioned-shaped tank tops, boxer shorts and bodysuits are clearly 
intended as outerwear. Details typical of exterior clothing have been added, 
giving an updated twist to classic forms. One favorite is the boxer short with 
a small functional pocket sewn on the front ($26). Popular among women are the 
cotton-Lycra tank tops ($39) and shorts ($49), which come with suspenders. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to underwear, V. M. 18 presents a unique array of silver jewelry by 
Erica Courtney and Alejandro Toussier, as well as handmade leather belts by 
Eric Todd.

NRC INVESTIGATING RADIOACTIVE SPILL IN VA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigators checked the La Jolla VA Medical 
Center and the homes of about a dozen laboratory workers Saturday but found no 
evidence of dangerous radioactivity from a spill of radioactive materials in 
one of the labs. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which occurred Thursday night or early Friday morning in a 
sixth-floor research laboratory, "poses no threat to anyone who visited the 
hospital, patients there or workers in other areas of the facility," said NRC 
spokesman Greg Cook. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people we have concerns about are those who were working in the 
immediate area of the spill, and that concern exists because we do not have 
enough information as yet to say definitively that they have not been 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that the NRC team arrived about midnight Friday and has surveyed the 
laboratory where the spill occurred, but has not had a chance to interview 
workers in the area to determine just what happened and when. 
</P>
<P>
A check of public areas in the Veterans Administration hospital turned up no 
traces of the radioactive material, Phosphorus 32, which is usually used to 
trace the path of other materials in research projects. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that the San Diego Poison Control Center "was inundated with calls 
from concerned people" after the accident became public Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
NRC investigators checked hallways and elevators and found only minute traces 
of the radioactive material, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was after the hospital's maintenance crew had done a cleanup of the 
area," he explained, "and we were satisfied that there was no danger, that no 
danger exists or had existed" in areas outside the sixth floor research 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Checks of about 10 homes of researchers turned up only contamination on a pair 
of shoes, he said. He termed the contamination "very low level" and said that 
it was removed by simply washing off the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials discovered the radioactive accident when they arrived for 
work about 8:30 Friday morning and found that the entrance to the sixth floor 
research lab where the spill occurred had been sealed with tape, signaling a 
radioactive accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It got spread around the hospital quite a bit," Cook said, "but we believe 
that, based on the kind of material they were using, there is no safety 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Gray, spokeswoman for the VA Hospital, said that the hospital was "back 
to normal" Saturday following the cleanup. She said the material is not 
considered dangerous enough to require wearing masks, gowns or shoe covers, and 
said that harmful effects occur only from ingesting the material. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be about the same level of radiation as if you flew from San Diego to 
New York on an airliner at 40,000 feet," she said of the danger to hospital 
personnel, patients or visitors Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that because of the extensive interviews and other investigations, 
the NRC team may be at the La Jolla hospital "well into next week." 
</P>
<P>
The federal regulatory agency could take a number of actions against the 
hospital if it finds that there were improper procedures or lax safety 
standards at the facility, Cook said 
</P>
<P>
The most severe penalty would be revocation of the hospital's permit for use of 
radioactive materials, Cook said. Other, less severe penalties include fines, 
citations which require written answers and possible corrective action or 
orders requiring changes in hospital procedures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to look at the hospital's procedures and see whether the actions 
which were taken in this case were appropriate before considering any sort of 
action," Cook said. "Until we have a handle on what actually occurred, we have 
no way to assess whether the proper measures were taken."

SAN MARCOS' PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Marcos is at a crossroads, and the election Nov. 6 may well determine which 
direction it will take. 
</P>
<P>
The city can either continue on its pell-mell growth pattern, with no concern 
about the pleas of residents for reasonable, lower-density development. Or it 
can respect the wishes of residents by choosing the path that retains many of 
the characteristics that have made San Marcos unique. 
</P>
<P>
The only City Council member who has been dedicated to protecting residents' 
rights and quality of life is Pia Harris. I have known Pia for 21 years, and 
she keeps her word to voters. She cares about people and about San Marcos.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to your editorial ("Change in the Offing," Oct. 26), I would like 
to give you some missing information about Hope Logan, a candidate for Board of 
Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, Denise Moreno Ducheny, appears to be promoted by you partially 
for "the kind of fire needed on this board." 
</P>
<P>
Others, as you state, see her style as confrontational. A confrontational 
style, in my experience, is simply ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hope Logan, a former professor at San Diego State 
University, has been remarkably effective on boards from which she has gained 
vast experience. Your editorial states: "Either woman would make an exemplary 
trustee." 
</P>
<P>
As I have sat on a board of directors and on several committees with Logan, I 
have seen her in action. Hope Logan is impressive in her determination to solve 
problems. She is a powerful negotiator and communicator. Her reasons are backed 
by factual data. Hope Logan is persuasive in her dialogues. Her successful 
community service record is an indication of her superb leadership ability. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is fortunate to have such a caring and capable candidate as Hope 
Logan for the Board of Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges.

2 CHARGED WITH MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old San Marcos boy led sheriff's deputies to the home of two men who 
he said had repeatedly raped and sexually abused him Friday night after luring 
him away from a San Marcos taco shop to a house in a remote area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, was abducted by the two 
men about 6 Friday evening and finally released by the men four hours later 
several miles from the house where he had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
The boy found his way back home and told his parents about the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old was able to lead the deputies back to his attackers' house and 
to describe the type of car they were driving. Sheriff's investigators obtained 
a search warrant and entered the suspects' house about 8 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence seized included adult pornographic videotapes and items of clothing 
believed to have been worn by the suspects at the time of the assault on the 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and jailed on charges of kidnap, child molestation, sodomy, oral 
copulation and displaying pornographic material to children are Warren Patrick 
Derichweiler, 24, and Miguel Chavez, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Both are being held at the Vista detention facility in lieu of bail, which was 
set at $160,000.

CANYON FIRE CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civilian and military fire units contained a brush fire early Saturday morning 
that burned 1,500 acres in the Margarita Canyon area near Camp Pendleton, a 
Marine Corps spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 fire units quickly responded to reports of a fire in a remote area 
approximately 2 miles from Meadow Creek Deluz housing area Friday afternoon, 
public affairs spokesman Sgt. Rene Reyna said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters controlled the blaze around 2 a.m. Saturday. There was no 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire is well-contained," he said. "Now it's a matter of letting it take 
its course, waiting for it to die out." 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter suffered a sprained ankle and another received cuts while 
battling the flames, Reyna said. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

WHALE OF A WORK IN PROGRESS OFFERS GLIMPSE TO PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newest addition to Sea World's family of whales is also the oldest -- 3 
million years old, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
"Bony" is a nearly complete fossil of a young adult right whale that expired in 
shallow coastal waters over what is now Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary exhibit of the fossil was unveiled Friday at the marine park. The 
display will last two or three months, while a team of paleontologists prepares 
and reconstructs the whale's skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is the brainchild of paleontologist Tom Demere, who manages the 
fossil collections at the San Diego Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to a museum, you see a skeleton all cleaned and fully mounted, and 
you lose that sense that it's been buried for 3-million years," Demere said. 
</P>
<P>
This fossil is particularly interesting, he said, because it is the only one of 
its kind that has been found in California. 
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was discovered during the grading of a portion of the Rancho del 
Rey housing development in Chula Vista, when earth-moving equipment chipped off 
a piece of it, Demere said. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, McMillin Communities, offered to help fund the exhibit, in 
partnership with Sea World. The Museum of Natural History will provide the 
paleontologists. After the exhibit closes, the fossil will join many others 
unearthed at the Rancho del Rey site that are now in the museum's collections. 
</P>
<P>
"So many times we find ourselves wearing the black hat, being the land-raper," 
said Ed Elliott, executive vice-president of development engineering for 
McMillin Communities. "We're providing a free excavation for a guy like Tom, in 
order to build the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
Since grading on the development began in 1988, the team of consulting 
paleontologists headed by Demere has identified fossilized remains of "the 
largest sea cow that ever lived," a previously unknown species of toothless 
walrus, and "the largest assemblage of fossil sea birds anywhere in the world," 
Demere said. 
</P>
<P>
And lots of other whales. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been collecting different kinds of baleen whales," Demere said. "We 
collected a fin whale yesterday, without a head." 
</P>
<P>
Baleen whales, which include the right whales, gray whales, and blue whales, 
have a sort of vertical strainer -- the baleen -- where killer whales have 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Blue and gray whales trap schools of fish or bottom muck in their mouths and 
force the water out, Demere said. But right whales are "passive strainers -- 
they're constantly skimming" as they swim along with their mouths slightly open 
and water flowing out again through the baleen -- minus fish and krill. 
</P>
<P>
"Bony" is missing his or her baleen, however, as well as the lower jaw and 
flippers. 
</P>
<P>
But fortunately for paleontology, Bony's carcass sank "en masse" before it was 
further dismembered, Demere said. It landed in what paleontologists now call 
the San Diego formation, a 100-foot-thick layer of sandstone deposited in 
shallow coastal waters that once covered Imperial Beach, National City, Chula 
Vista and part of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Land animals prevalent during that time, some of whose remains are also 
deposited in eastern Chula Vista, included mastodons, horses, tapirs, giant 
camels, skunk, puma, and rabbits.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encinitas woman was allegedly kidnaped from her home by a former boyfriend 
just moments after calling 911 for help Saturday morning, a Sheriff's spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Marie Maloney, 36, of the 100 block of Phoebe Street, called 911 at 7:55 
a.m. Saturday and said "Sonny" was kicking in her door. 
</P>
<P>
The phone was then disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
The first Sheriff's deputy to the scene arrived three minutes after Maloney's 
call was placed and found the door kicked in, the telephone disconnected and no 
one inside the apartment. A witness said Wilmer "Sonny" Evans Hart Jr., 43, of 
Encinitas, led Maloney to her car, a 1984 tan over gold Dodge 600 convertible 
with license plate number 1JWM820, and ordered her to get in the back seat. 
Maloney complied and Hart drove away in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney and Hart had apparently had a tumultuous relationship over the past 
three weeks, capped last Sunday by Maloney filing a temporary restraining order 
prohibiting Hart to contact her. Maloney claimed Hart assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
The missing woman is described as white, with shoulder-length brown wavy hair 
and brown eyes, 5 foot 7 inches and 128 pounds. She was wearing a long white 
nightgown. The suspect is a white man, 6 foot 3 inches and 210 pounds with 
blondish-gray shoulder-length hair and blue eyes and a Fu Manchu-style 
mustache. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Hart and Maloney is asked to call 
Sheriff's Homicide Detail at 565-5200.

WILLIAMS BECOMES BRUINS' LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: SOPHOMORE IS MAIN REASON UCLA IS 21-1 OVERALL AND 13-0 IN THE 
PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From 1987 through 1989, the UCLA women's volleyball teams bore the hallmark of 
three-time All-American middle blocker Daiva Tomkus, who has completed her 
eligibility and is trying out for the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
This season the leadership gap seems to have been filled mostly by outside 
hitter Natalie Williams, a second-team All-American last year. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 6-foot-1 sophomore from Taylorsville, Utah, is leading the team 
with 348 kills and an average of 4.46 kills a game and has spurred the Bruins 
to a 21-1 overall record. UCLA, ranked No. 1 in the nation, is 13-0 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In an important victory over fifth-ranked Stanford two weeks ago, she set 
school single-game records for kills with 37 and digs with 18. Last week she 
had a team-high 16 kills, six digs and four blocks as the Bruins defeated 
Oregon State in four games, and she added eight kills, three blocks, two 
service aces and two digs in a three-game sweep of Oregon. The victories over 
the Oregon schools extended UCLA's Pac-10 winning streak to 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is getting plenty of help at the outside hitter position from junior 
Jenny Evans and senior Samantha Shaver. Sophomores Marissa Hatchett and Irene 
Renteria and freshman Lisa Hudak have filled in capably for Tomkus at middle 
blocker. Holly McPeak, a transfer from Berkeley, has provided experience and 
stability at setter. And there are others. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little question that Coach Andy Banachowski has looked to Williams 
to lead the attack. The offense lost a good deal when junior outside hitter 
Elaine Youngs, a first-team All-American and a second-team selection in 1988, 
was lost for the season after she had knee surgery in August. 
</P>
<P>
Banachowski said that he had planned to rely more on Williams this season by 
adding a backcourt attack, where she seems to perform best as a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the losses of Tomkus and Youngs, he said, "we're not hitting as well 
as we did as a team. Each of the other players has (improved) her hitting 
percentage, but we're still not making up for their loss in (the team's) 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot less physical and athletic without Daiva and Elaine. We're 
smaller, but we're quicker and a lot better defensively than we were in 
previous years." 
</P>
<P>
Shavers and Evans lead the team on defense with their digs. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Williams "gives us the power we need. She is right on pace with 
last year. She started slowly, but she sure is hitting a lot more balls from 
the backcourt, which is a little bit more difficult. She also has a little bit 
more terminating power, being able to put the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility, I think, is difficult for her at times. I ask a lot of her 
and expect a lot of her, but sometimes I forget she is only a sophomore and 
hasn't played that much volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was an All-American in volleyball in high school in Taylorsville, 
a suburb of Salt Lake City, the club teams she played against in Utah and 
Nevada may not have been as strong or played as many matches as those in 
California, Banachowski said. She was also a high school All-American in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"That put her a little behind in volleyball," Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that basketball was her "first real sport." That shouldn't be 
surprising since her father, Nate, was a basketball standout at Utah State and 
played for years in the NBA with the Golden State Warriors and the New Orleans 
(now Utah) Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
She averaged 30 points and 17 rebounds a game and led Taylorsville High to the 
state finals in her senior year and was named to the prep All-American teams of 
Street and Smith's magazine and USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Although UCLA women's basketball Coach Billie Moore wanted her to play for the 
Bruins last season, Williams said that she wanted to concentrate on her studies 
and volleyball. She said that she does plan to play basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Widdison, her volleyball coach at Taylorsville High, convinced her that 
volleyball should be her main sport. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me that in basketball I would just be another good player but that in 
volleyball I could be one of the best," Williams said. "She also said that I 
could go farther, there were more opportunities, in volleyball -- the pro 
leagues, beach volleyball and the national team." 
</P>
<P>
She was one of two high school players invited to train with the U.S. team, 
played for the U.S. in last summer's Canadian Cup and will probably try out for 
the national B team that will play in next summer's World Games. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, she is concentrating on improving her game and helping UCLA win an 
NCAA championship, a prize that has eluded the Bruins since they won their only 
national title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she thinks her defense has improved 100% since high school and 
that she has become a better hitter since she improved her shot placement. 
</P>
<P>
Large doses of volleyball have not soured her on the sport. She said that she 
enjoys practices and goes hard "every day because I know Andy relies on me 
more. So I push myself because I know I can make the team better." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she has to learn to block and serve better to become a better 
team player. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that the key to bringing UCLA an NCAA championship this year will be 
better teamwork. She said that when the Bruins lost to Nebraska in three games 
in the NCAA semifinals last year it seemed that she and her teammates "played 
like individuals. We played scared." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's only loss this season was to Nebraska in September in the University of 
Hawaii tournament, but Williams doesn't think that she and her teammates were 
afraid of the Cornhuskers in that match. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins extended Nebraska to four games in Hawaii, and Williams thinks that 
match will help UCLA in the NCAA playoffs, which begin Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the loss will help," she said. "We didn't lose really badly. At times 
we came back, so we proved we can be down and come back. I think we're improved 
as a team." 
</P>
<P>
This year's loss may have been a blessing for the Bruins since it came after 
three sloppy victories in the University of Wisconsin tournament. Banachowski 
said that he felt "really good about this year's loss to Nebraska because we 
played very well."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP;

EL CAMINO FLATTENS MT. SAC, 40-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The El Camino College football team kept alive its hopes for a bowl bid by 
defeating Mt. San Antonio College, 40-21, in a Mission Conference Northern 
Division game at Walnut Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino is 7-2 overall and 5-2 in league play. Mt. SAC fell to 4-5 and 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' Anthony Daigle rushed for 126 yards on 24 carries and scored 
three touchdowns, one of them on a 12-yard pass from quarterback Rod Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey completed 12 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown. He also fumbled twice 
and was intercepted once, but that didn't stop the Warriors' scoring machine. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, which usually gets off to slow starts, scored three touchdowns in 
the first half. The Warriors drove 53 yards in four plays for the first 
touchdown. Harvey's pass to Daigle gave El Camino a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC answered with a 72-yard drive that was capped by Marshawn Thompson's 
two-yard touchdown run. The score was set up by Mike Galindo's 48-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino regained the lead on its next possession. The Warriors drove 53 yards 
in 10 plays, with Daigle scoring from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior defensive back Donovan Gallatin, who missed two games this season with 
a concussion, scored El Camino's third touchdown of the half. The freshman 
intercepted a Bill Gallis' pass and returned it 34 yards for the touchdown and 
a 21-7 El Camino lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC scored with 4:21 left in the second quarter after guard Spencer Keala 
recovered a Harvey fumble. Fred Coffee scored on a four-yard run to cut El 
Camino's lead to 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Perez kicked a 41-yard field goal with 7:08 left in the third quarter to 
give the Warriors a 24-14 edge. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino marched 75 yards on 12 plays for its next touchdown. Daigle jumped 
over the Mt. SAC line for the touchdown from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties answered with a four-yard touchdown pass from Anthony Calvillo to 
Coffee with 6:52 left in the game. The play was set up by Calvillo's 45-yard 
pass to Demetrius Baptiste. 
</P>
<P>
Perez hit a 33-yard field goal with 3:28 remaining to increase El Camino's lead 
to 34-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' last touchdown was set up by Shannon Thompson's 60-yard punt 
return. Tony DaCosta scored three plays later on a two-yard run with 38 seconds 
left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield 21, L.A. Southwest 0 -- Southwest could have used a little offense 
against the nation's No. 1 team, but couldn't generate much of an attack 
against the visiting Renegades. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest did manage to hold Bakersfield 23 points under its scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't practice defense all year to have people to score against you," 
Southwest Coach Henry Washington said. "You've got to go in with the idea to 
shut the other team out." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest's defense failed in only one area -- the Cougars gave up big plays at 
crucial times. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (8-0 overall, 7-0 in the Western State Conference) set up its first 
touchdown on a 33-yard run by halfback Nathan Dupree, and capped the drive on a 
20-yard first-quarter touchdown pass from Bryan Nixon to flanker Lance Patton. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (3-5, 2-5) got burned again by the big play later in the quarter. 
Nixon passed 56 yards to Patton, which led to Shon Ellerbe's one-yard scoring 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The final Bakersfield touchdown came on a 25-yard pass over the middle to David 
Dunn, with Nixon throwing only seconds before he was flattened by Southwest 
linebacker Mark Fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could have won if we could slow down some of that big-play 
madness," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield held Southwest to only 110 total yards. Southwest quarterback Craig 
Manigo was flushed from the pocket often and completed only 13 of 31 passes for 
93 yards and was intercepted twice. Southwest's running game was also bottled 
up, held to 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 27, Harbor 0 -- Bobby Webster rushed for three touchdowns and Glendale 
(6-2) held Harbor (4-4) to only 112 yards of offense.

GRAY BEATS CRIMSON, 188-177 IN LOYOLA SCRIMMAGE 
</P>

<P>
Loyola Marymount's basketball scrimmage at Gersten Pavilion may have been as 
notable for who was missing as who was on hand Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With two probable starters injured, the Lions managed to score 365 points as 
the Gray team beat the Crimson, 188-177. 
</P>
<P>
That was accomplished with point guard Tony Walker and 6-foot-10 center Richard 
Petruska -- both expected to start -- as well as forward Christian Scott 
sitting out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Terrell Lowery and redshirt sophomore Brian McCloskey scored 54 and 41 
points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
However, with several veterans sitting out, the talented freshman class got to 
show off, with Kareem Washington matching Lowery's 54 points and Rahim Harris 
getting 45. Junior transfer Craig Holt, expected to add three-point punch, got 
34 points and led both teams with eight three-point baskets. Another freshman, 
Ross Richardson, scored 15 points and hit four of six three-point shots. 
Freshman point guard Greg Evans had 17 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"We played some guys we probably won't play (a lot)," Lion Coach Jay Hillock 
said. "I like the freshmen. . . . we've got four solid freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
The Gray team, which never trailed, led 97-94 at halftime. Senior Marcus Slater 
had 30 points and 24 rebounds for the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who had off-season wrist surgery, aggravated the wrist in practice and 
is sitting out seven to 10 days. He will then be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
Walker reported some improvement Saturday. Petruska, who has a groin injury, 
will return to practice Monday on a limited basis. Scott, who suffered a broken 
nose in practice, will return with a mask Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock, who got on his team for committing fouls when they were tired, said: 
"Were playing hard. We've got a lot of work to do. A lot of things will smooth 
out starting this week. We've got to get in better shape, and we've got to 
install an interior game. Obviously, with Petruska out, we didn't have much of 
an inside game. That will be our emphasis the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will get a better idea of where they stand when they play their first 
exhibition game Saturday against a touring Australian team. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's scrimmage, Coach Todd Corman's starting team defeated the 
reserves, 77-29, led by center Tricia Gibson's 19 points and 12 rebounds. Guard 
Lynn Flanagan and forward Jamie Jesko scored 17 apiece. Lisa Humphreys led the 
reserves with 12 points.

PEOPLE: TEACHER PUTS LOTS OF LIFE INTO A DEADLY SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Park High School teacher Richard Loya has gained quite a reputation 
for his teaching techniques, especially his AIDS classes. 
</P>
<P>
Loya has taught high school courses about acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
for many years. He also has taught AIDS classes in Guam and helped other 
teachers teach students about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is playing a central role in a film about the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington television and film production company selected Loya and three 
other health instructors from other parts of the country to appear in a film on 
AIDS, after observing them and more than 20 other teachers from across the 
country in action in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We found him to be dynamic and frank in getting the message out," said the 
production company producer, Roberta Hantgan. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are starring in "Saving a Generation," a videotape for students 
and teachers, which was produced by State of the Art Inc., a small media 
production company in Washington. The company received a $200,000 grant from 
eight public and private agencies, including Centers For Disease Control in 
Atlanta, to produce the video, which is being sold to school districts 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The three other teachers are from Tennessee, Minnesota and Maryland and 
represent a cross-section of students of various ages and ethnic groups, 
Hantgan said. Huntington Park High is a year-round school in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. About 90% of its 3,600 students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Loya discusses how AIDS is killing thousands of people each year 
and will continue to do so. He tells students that the best way to prevent AIDS 
is to abstain from sex until marriage. But for those who do have sex, he 
discusses the use of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
On the film, an AIDS patient also speaks before Loya's class on his personal 
battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Loya, 44, has taught health in high schools for 20 years. His wife, Linda, also 
44, is a counselor at the school. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Loya said he is factual and at the same time tries to be 
provocative to get the students' attention on health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching is a performing art. Every day you are on stage. You have to get 
their attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loya does not allow students to bring their books to class, which gives them an 
incentive to come prepared for discussions and tests, because they don't want 
to be embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
Loya also believes in involving students in the subjects. He has had his 
students take trips in wheelchairs around the neighborhood to find out what it 
is like to be a paraplegic. To show the dangers of smoking, the teacher will 
have students smoke in class. He measures their blood pressure and heart rates 
before and after they smoke to show the dramatic increase in both pressure and 
heart rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten more kids to quit this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents must give permission in writing for their children to receive AIDS 
instruction and to participate in smoking tests, Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he helped organize a conference on AIDS sponsored by the National 
Assn. of School Health Teachers in Long Beach to assist teachers in teaching 
about AIDS. He has taught AIDS education classes to parents, teachers and 
students at the University of Guam and has been invited to return next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach native has received many awards during his teaching career. In 
1975, he was named Outstanding High School Health Education Teacher by the 
California Assn. for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance Board. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, his alma mater, Cal State Long Beach, presented him with a 
Distinguished Alumnus Award. He has bachelor's and master's degrees in health 
education from the university, where he also teaches health classes. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Van Steenbergen, a social studies teacher at Jordan High School in Long 
Beach, is one of 36 teachers from around the country to be honored today on a 
two-hour Disney Channel program saluting educators. The program will be shown 
at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
One teacher will be selected Outstanding Teacher of 1990. More than $250,000 
will be awarded, including $50,000 to be divided between the top teacher and 
his school. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Steenbergen was named Teacher of the Year by the Credential 
Counselors and Analysts of California, a statewide organization of college 
counselors. Steenbergen, who has taught in the Long Beach Unified School 
District for 35 years, was recently appointed to Long Beach's newly formed 
Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, he has been credited with helping students with their 
studies as well as their problems. He has formed drug awareness programs and 
many student support groups. 
</P>
<P>
He has a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA and a master's degree in 
religion from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Elisaldez, a part-time employee of the Pico Rivera Recreation and Community 
Services Department since 1980, has been promoted to the full-time position of 
recreation supervisor. Elisaldez, 29, is a senior at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
He is majoring in public administration.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL VOTES TO KEEP BUT CHANGE ITS LOW-COST HOUSING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A low-income housing law, which has been under attack from various quarters 
since its inception last year, has narrowly survived another assault. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last week voted 5 to 4 to reject an effort to repeal the 
ordinance, referring it instead to a committee for revisions. 
</P>
<P>
The vote shocked a group of developers and some council members, who had 
expected a council majority to scuttle the bill after a court had thrown out a 
similar measure in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg, who led the effort to repeal the ordinance on the 
grounds that it is illegal, vowed to carry on the battle in committee. "We'll 
still repeal it," he said. "It will just take longer." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude, Tom Clark, Clarence Smith, Ray Grabinski and 
Warren Harwood voted to send the issue to committee. Kellogg, Wallace 
</P>
<P>
Harwood, who made statements favoring the repeal during Tuesday's meeting, 
shocked colleagues by voting to refer the matter to committee. Mayor Ernie 
Kell, described by Kellogg as one of the behind-the-scenes opponents of the 
law, even asked Harwood whether he was sure about his vote. Harwood said he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
During a recess called minutes later, Kellogg threw up his arms as ordinance 
foes scurried down the aisle to confer with him. "What happened?" asked Rich 
Johnson, spokesman for the Long Beach Board of Realtors. "He must have pushed 
the wrong (expletive) button!" Kellogg and Edgerton, red-faced and gesturing, 
rushed up to Harwood after the vote. They said later that Harwood had 
personally promised his support several times, including immediately before the 
council met. 
</P>
<P>
Housing activists were ecstatic, but equally dumbfounded. Alan Lowenthal, 
president of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, put his hand to his heart. "I 
don't know how it happened, but it's a victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood said he was swayed by public testimony. "Counting on my vote with much 
certainty is not the best thing to do, because I'm listening to what's being 
said," he said after the debate. "I heard testimony that said 'let's fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Housing activists told the council that the court case is being used as an 
"excuse" to destroy housing programs for the poor. Activists also argued that 
the ordinance could be revised to comply with the ruling, rather than being 
rescinding entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater," Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
The low-income housing law, also known as the city's one-for-one ordinance, was 
passed last year by the City Council and went into effect in February. It 
requires owners who demolish or convert low-income units to either replace them 
with other low-cost housing or to pay compensation fees to the city, which are 
to be put into a fund to build low-cost housing. The ordinance is the 
cornerstone of the city's low-income housing program.

UCLA STUDENTS GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT SLANG; 
</P>
<P>
LANGUAGE: A SAMPLER OF UCLA-SPEAK IS A HOT SELLER ON CAMPUS. AN EXPANDED 
VERSION IS DUE IN FEBRUARY. 
</P>

<P>
Not too long ago, linguistics professor Pamela Munro didn't know a "beauhunk" 
from a "goob." 
</P>
<P>
Then she started assigning her students at UCLA to collect slang terms. And 
last fall, after students in her Linguistics 88A seminar had collected and 
compiled an extensive list, they decided they had the makings of a book. 
</P>
<P>
The result, a dictionary called "U.C.L.A. Slang," is a hot item in the 
bookstore at "Pretty People University" (UCLA). Now, even the most uncool 
"remos" (nerds) on campus who may "jones for" (really want) popularity can use 
the dictionary to learn what's hip. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,300 copies have been sold locally. The dictionary has been so well 
received that Harmony Books, which is a part of Random House, has picked it up 
for publication and will release a more comprehensive version under the title 
"Slang U," expected to reach bookstores by early February. 
</P>
<P>
Although excited over the dictionary's success, Munro is taking the hoopla -- 
not to be confused with "brewhaha," which at UCLA means beer -- in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is interested in slang," she said. "A lot of the expressions 
in the dictionary are funny." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary is popular not just among the school's "beauhunks" (gorgeous 
men) and "bettys" (gorgeous women), "goobs" and "dweebs" (nerds of any sex), 
and "way fashionable studs." Parents are also getting in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a number of parents say they bought the dictionary so they could 
understand what their child is saying," Munro said. "Some read it and say they 
can't believe people are saying these things." 
</P>
<P>
A linguistics professor at UCLA since 1974, Munro said she was turned on to the 
richness of slang in 1981 by Connie Eble, a professor at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill who publishes papers on campus slang each year. 
</P>
<P>
The use of slang is nothing new, Munro noted. One of its functions is to help 
define distinct social groups. 
</P>
<P>
Munro said the ephemerality of slang is unpredictable. "Some slang words stay 
around and some don't," she said. "It's really hard to say which ones will 
last." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the entries in the dictionary are common to campuses across 
the nation, Munro said many are unique to "Joe and Josephine Bruins" (UCLA 
students). 
</P>
<P>
Slang, she said, comes from a variety of sources. Some terms are adaptations of 
existings words, some are compounded or come from standard vocabulary, and 
others are words picked up from television and movie characters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Munro cited a popular saying that is not listed in the campus 
dictionary but will be in the Harmony Books version: "Sally," a name given to a 
woman who is compulsive and meticulous. It comes from the movie "When Harry Met 
Sally," Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study of slang is only a small portion of her work, Munro said it 
has been enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
"If you study any kind of language, you learn a great respect for the human 
brain," she said. "There are clever minds that come up with these slangs, and 
you think, 'How did someone come up with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the students at UCLA think it's "no biggie." They come up with slang 
terms "24-7" (all the time, derived from 24 hours a day, seven days a week). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'U.C.L.A. SLANG': A SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of words and expressions found in "U.C.L.A. Slang": 
</P>
<P>
adonis -- extremely nice looking, breathtaking; used as a noun or adjective. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
filet -- cute girl. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 228 to 200, the House approved the conference report on budget 
legislation (HR 5835) aimed at slowing deficit growth by about $490 billion 
over five years. Democrats voted 181 for and 74 against, and Republicans 47 for 
and 126 against. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would improve but not cure America's deficit 
problem. For example, red ink this fiscal year is projected to top $200 billion 
even after the bill trims it by $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue side of HR 5835 is estimated at about $189 billion. Upper-income 
taxpayers will supply most of the tax yield as a result of curbs on their 
deductions and personal exemptions. Most other Americans will be touched by 
higher taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and airline tickets, 
an expansion of the wage base for Medicare payroll taxes and other revenue 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
A defense slowdown of about $185 billion over five years is the bill's major 
spending restraint. Medicare curbs are estimated at $44 billion, about $10 
billion of which will hit beneficiaries. Spending growth is curbed by $12 
billion for farm subsidies, $7.6 billion for civil servant retirement benefits 
and $3.7 billion for veterans' benefits, among other restraints. 
</P>
<P>

NAVY BASE EXPANSION DRAWS FIRE

SEAL BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The community around the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station roared like seldom 
before with the unveiling of a $200-million plan to expand the coastal base. 
Everybody, even conservative Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, seemed to agree: bad 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Surf would be ruined. Beaches would be eroded. Ocean views would be pockmarked 
by more ships. More missiles could mean greater chances of accidental 
explosions. And for the first time in years, there were even whispers of dread 
about nuclear weapons -- rumored but never proven to be stored here. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's only naval weapons depot had rarely drawn such 
large-scale ire, traditionally attracting more attention for endangered species 
on its pastoral national wildlife refuge than for safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the September derailment in Westminster of a train carrying thousands 
of rounds of live ammunition from the sprawling station, causing no injuries 
but raising concern about what kinds of explosives might be traveling through 
suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
Long the Sleepy Hollow of military bases, Seal Beach was thrust into the news 
at the same time the base's 46-year sweetheart relationship with neighbors was 
strained because of a proposed wharf expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived in harmony with the Navy and the base for decades because it 
hasn't intruded into our community," said Gwen Forsythe, one of the five Seal 
Beach City Council members who voted to oppose the expansion. Her home is 300 
yards from the depot's entrance. "Now we have something that will intrude." 
</P>
<P>
"We think the base has been a good neighbor," added Gordon R. Labedz, a Seal 
Beach physician and a leader of Stop the Breakwater, the umbrella opposition 
group representing residents, surfers, realtors, environmentalists and even a 
few developers. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hate to think what might replace this place," he said. "But if they 
approved this whole plan, I think there would be a big move to shut the base 
down." 
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Pearl Harbor that killed 3,700 people and destroyed 18 
ammunition-laden ships prompted construction of America's five naval weapons 
bases: Seal Beach and Concord on the West Coast; Charleston, Earl and Yorktown, 
the nation's busiest, on the East Coast. Their function: to store and test 
weapons, and to load and unload ammunition before ships enter the naval 
harbors, thereby avoiding a repeat tragedy when much of America's naval might 
was docked and stored in one place. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach depot was built the same year America suffered its worst 
home-front disaster of World War II, a July, 1944, blast that killed 320 
servicemen and civilians and injured another 400 at Concord. 
</P>
<P>
But Seal Beach has never had an explosives-related death or serious injury like 
that at Concord, when a peace protester's legs were torn off in 1987 by a train 
that failed to stop in time. 
</P>
<P>
That, the Navy and base detractors agree, is why the 30,000 residents of Seal 
Beach have largely lived peacefully with the military installation. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on 5,000 acres fronting the Pacific Ocean and home to 222 sailors and 
917 civilians, the Seal Beach base wraps around the heart of the city on the 
north and east. It is bounded by the San Diego Freeway at the north, Seal Beach 
Boulevard to the west, and Bolsa Chica Road to the south. At its southwest 
border, beachfront homes sit 30 yards from the base. More than half of the land 
is open space, from the 1,000-acre national wildlife refuge with its wetlands 
and endangered wildlife species, to the 2,171 acres of farmland where numerous 
crops are grown. 
</P>
<P>
It is the Navy's chief southern West Coast port for storing tons of ammunition 
and weapons -- from .45-caliber bullets to 2,700-pound projectiles fired from 
battleships -- and loading them onto vessels home ported at Long Beach and San 
Diego naval bases. The Navy won't say exactly how much is being shipped yearly 
from the base, although a 1983 General Accounting Office Report stated 42,000 
gross tons annually were then being handled there. Repair work on surface 
missiles and anti-submarine combat systems plus hundreds of weapons components 
also is done at the depot. 
</P>
<P>
There are actually two other sites under the command of the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station: The Navy's Gage and Standards Center in Pomona, and a 
Fallbrook annex beside Camp Pendleton, which stores and repairs air-launched 
weapons and acts as the chief provisioner of conventional ordnance to the 
Marine Corps. Neither has a wharf. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated two-thirds of the Pacific Fleet's ships in the continental U.S. 
are based in San Diego and Long Beach, so Seal Beach has an active loading 
wharf, servicing an average of 365 ships yearly. Operation Desert Shield has 
stepped that up, requiring "a substantial amount of overtime," according to one 
Navy source. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its ordnance is transported from the base by truck rather than by ship, 
or train, Navy officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The base also tests ammunition and weaponry delivered by makers like General 
Dynamics before the Navy accepts ownership, then issues it to the Pacific 
Fleet. Like a warranty service, the ordnance is also periodically tested at the 
base during its life span. 
</P>
<P>
So how safe is the base? 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Dane LaJoye , a spokesman for the Navy in Washington, Seal 
Beach's safety record, like the country's other four naval weapons stations, 
has been judged "excellent." 
</P>
<P>
Obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, parts of inspection reports by 
the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board from 1986 through 1989 
indicate there have been violations, although none considered by experts to be 
alarming for an ammunition depot. 
</P>
<P>
The reports summarized findings, many of them with partial omissions. A 1986 
inspection, for instance, cites a leaking roof near a testing cell on a 
building used for Standard missile maintenance; improperly stored paint and 
solvents; testing of anti-submarine missile motor control circuits in a 
windowed building within 100 feet of a lightly traveled street, and outdoor 
storage at the Fallbrook annex of 21 million pounds of Vietnam-era napalm, some 
of it leaking from canisters. 
</P>
<P>
By spring of 1989, however, when inspectors visited the Seal Beach base, it got 
a clean bill of health, the safety reports indicate. This year's study was not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's LaJoye said there have been no injuries resulting from ordnance 
accidents in the past two years at any of the nation's five naval weapons 
depots, and overall accident rates were deemed by the Navy to be "consistent" 
with those in private industrial-type work. 
</P>
<P>
The last time an employee was severely injured by a detonation at the Seal 
Beach Naval Weapons Station was in July, 1969. A fuse prematurely fired, 
injuring a worker's hand. In 1987, a container carrying a rocket motor slipped 
off the tines of a forklift, pinning a worker to the wall of a bunker and 
fracturing his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
Even with strict safety rules, handling the sheer volume of deadly weapons and 
explosives poses a potential danger, as the Navy itself illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing a 1988 review of all railroad operations at the country's five 
Navy weapons depots, Naval Sea Systems Cmdr. Robert Ailes said the Concord 
tragedy, in which the peace protester lost his legs, and a December, 1987, 
train-truck crash at the Seal Beach station prompted the examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I am becoming increasingly concerned with our railroad operations. The 
accident investigation information provided to me from the Concord and Seal 
Beach mishaps shows that several basic operational procedures were violated," 
the admiral wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators' report, dated July, 1988, revealed a variety of 
inconsistencies in policy and operational safety of the railroads, from lack of 
posted speed limits to an absence of guidelines for where to permit operation 
of radios that create electromagnetic fields that might detonate ordnance. The 
findings, however, were not linked to specific bases. Whether the problems have 
been corrected remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Seal Beach, which has 65 miles of railroad track, the accident 
involved a security guard who inadvertently backed his truck onto the tracks. 
Fog was heavy and the guard pulled off a base road until it was safe to drive 
again. He told investigators he did not hear the train's horn until it was too 
late to move his truck, which was struck and dragged about 30 feet. The guard 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Stephen Holl, commander of the Seal Beach depot, and other base officials 
say trains are seldom used to transport cargo from the base -- perhaps no more 
than six times a year and that trucks are used to move cargo and ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
But with increased demands on trucks during the Persian Gulf crisis, some of 
the load has been shifted to trains, said James Grill, director of the base's 
explosives safety division. 
</P>
<P>
As for nuclear weapons, the government's longstanding policy is to neither 
confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at its installations. However, 
the Navy said seven years ago that it lacked the storage capability for nuclear 
warheads and only anticipated keeping such weapons in the event of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Even Greenpeace, the international environmental organization currently 
involved in a large-scale campaign to rid the seas of nuclear weapons, says 
there are none at the Seal Beach site. 
</P>
<P>
If the nuclear issue has failed to spark interest locally, it has been just the 
opposite with the ambitious expansion plan, which many Seal Beach residents 
view as no less than the beginning of the end to tourism and property values, 
the environment and small-town charm of their community. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for building a 4,000-foot extension of Anaheim Bay's east jetty, 
where large warships that presently won't fit in the port could load and unload 
ammunition. Holl has argued that the new breakwater will act as a barrier 
against sand erosion in the Sunset and Surfside beach areas, plus offer limited 
storm protection. 
</P>
<P>
There are three alternatives to the $200-million project, the most extensive of 
which would create an L-shaped jetty in front of the Surfside Colony 
beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
That configuration, the most staunchly opposed, would allow much larger ships 
to unload, thus potentially doubling the number visiting the base, base 
spokesman Tom Thomas said. A bigger port would also accommodate three new 
rapid-load supply vessels, the huge AOE-6s, only one of which has been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Navy now shares its Anaheim Bay ocean entrance with Huntington 
Harbour pleasure boaters, for years it has been granted waivers allowing 
shipment of explosives closer to populated areas than otherwise allowed by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the Navy's plan to change the mouth of Anaheim Bay would provide a 
separate, more secure entrance for naval ships. The Navy also argues that it 
would be a more efficient way to operate by allowing entry for ships that now 
have to be loaded and unloaded by barge three miles offshore, because they are 
too large to safely enter the bay. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report is now under way studying effects the expansion 
might have, and if Congress approves it, construction would start in 1993, with 
completion by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), a surfer who rides the Sunset Beach waves when 
he's in the district, has already vowed to oppose the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact on the whole coastal area is just too great compared with the 
benefits to the Navy that would slightly improve their operation," Rohrabacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Holl admits the plan is a hard-sell locally and he recently faced a hostile 
crowd of 100 people with normally disparate interests who turned out at a 
public hearing in late August. 
</P>
<P>
An unlikely coalition of environmentalists, peace activists, rich homeowners, 
surf riders and local merchants have banded together to fight the project. 
Sometimes their only shared interest is their opposition to the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists believe the shoreline will be altered by sand erosion and 
lack of waves that ordinarily cleanse the beach of debris carried to the sea by 
the San Gabriel River. No one argues that the surf would be eliminated because 
the jetty would create a protected bay. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors believe property values would plummet with the sight of big warships 
floating at the jetty a mile offshore. Business owners say the elimination of 
surf would diminish the town's allure to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way they will build that breakwater," said longtime resident 
Labedz. "It's an environmental nightmare, and for the first time there would be 
a total revolt about the base. Nobody wants to see that, though, because we've 
always got along with the base. . . . People worry about it but they kind of 
accept the idea that there might be a few nuclear weapons there. But nobody 
will accept this."

Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
Behind the forbidding fences of the ammunition depot is a world of juxtaposed 
cohabitants, at once bucolic and industrial. More than 130 ammo-filled bunkers, 
the low-slung buildings you see while whizzing by the base on the I-405 
Freeway, share the base with a 1,000-acre federal wildlife refuge. The mission 
of the base: loading and unloading Pacific Fleet vessels entering Long Beach 
and San Diego ports and weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
Inert Operations 
</P>
<P>
These buildings, now mostly empty, originally were used to assemble ammunition 
for WWII. 
</P>
<P>
Class Yard 
</P>
<P>
All ammunition-laden trucks or boxcars entering and leaving the Naval Weapons 
Station are inspected in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Ammunition Storage 
</P>
<P>
Storage buildings vary on the type of ammunition they will contain. This one 
has three separate rooms, each strongly shielded from the others to prevent a 
chain reaction in the event of an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Temporary Storage 
</P>
<P>
In the event a boxcar is loaded from one of the storage areas but can't be 
unloaded to a naval vessel, it will be stored temporarily in a large barricade 
like the one shown here to confine it in case of a mishap. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife Refuge 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge is the only one in the country sharing 
space with a military installation. Established in 1973, the refuge is home to 
at least five endangered species--the least tern, light-footed clapper rail and 
Belding's savannah sparrow among them.Red foxes have gravely reduced the least 
tern population. The Navy has been trapping, removing or killing the foxes as 
per a federal environmental report. Animal rights activists continue to oppose 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Wharf Expansion 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's $200-million plan would extend the east jetty of Anaheim Bay, 
enabling larger ships to dock. Barges must now ferry ammunition and weapons 
from the base to those larger vessels about three miles offshore. The new 
breakwater and its wharf would further distance explosives from surrounding 
community. 
</P>
<P>
A. Existing Wharf: This wharf is currently used to load ammunition onto the 
barges that supply ships anchored offshore. 
</P>
<P>
B. Proposed Wharf: Large vessels that are not able to dock at the current wharf 
in Anaheim Bay will use this wharf if it is built. 
</P>
<P>
C. Access to Huntington Harbor: If the jetty is expanded, a separate ocean 
entrance to Huntington Harbor would be created for pleasure boats, making the 
rest of the bay safer for the Navy.

CRASH IGNITES WALL OF FIRE ON O.C. FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tractor-trailer rig hauling butane canisters and car batteries collided with 
a milk truck early Saturday, igniting a spectacular fire that showered molten 
metal high into the air and closed portions of the San Diego Freeway for more 
than six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although both drivers survived and no one else was injured, California Highway 
Patrol officers said the leaking diesel fuel and butane combined to ignite a 
wall of fire about 5 feet high that stretched across the southbound lanes of 
the freeway just south of the Fairview Road exit, shortly after the 4:50 a.m. 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the crash, officers said, they were attempting to stop motorists 
from driving through the area when one vehicle passed them and drove through 
the fire wall. The motorist made it, apparently unhurt, and kept going as 
flames poured from the vehicle's wheel wells, said officers. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound freeway traffic was backed up from Harbor to Beach boulevards. Local 
streets in Costa Mesa were flooded with travelers seeking a way around the 
accident site. The jam caught some travelers on their way to nearby John Wayne 
Airport. At least 10 passengers missed their planes and had to be rebooked on 
later flights. 
</P>
<P>
The collision's impact was felt all the way to the Los Angeles County line as 
southbound freeway traffic was diverted to other arteries throughout Orange 
County in a nightmarish period of traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"We had metal flying off on the other side of the freeway," CHP Sgt. B.J. 
(Jerry) Ellison said, standing near the charred hulks left on the road surface. 
"This thing was big time. This was as big of a hazardous materials situation as 
I have ever seen at one time." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the rig, David L. Fulton, 43, of Oceanside and Bhikhabhai Patel, 
22, of Buena Park, who was driving the milk truck, were taken to College 
Hospital Costa Mesa where they were treated for minor injuries. They were 
released before noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Patel noticed smoke rising from his truck and slowed to 
pull to the shoulder, said CHP Public Affairs Officer Linda Burrus. Then the 
truck caught fire, and Patel bailed out, leaving the truck in a traffic lane, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the double-trailer rig, carrying 33 pounds of butane canisters 
and 1,600 pounds of dry car batteries for TNT Bestway Transportation of Los 
Angeles, apparently was unable to stop and rammed the milk truck. Officers said 
the crash carried both trucks into the concrete freeway divider, where fire 
engulfed the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton went partly through the windshield in the collision. He was able to 
crawl to safety before the truck was fully engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Saturday evening from his home, Fulton said he 
remained conscious after the impact and felt his truck sliding out of control 
across the freeway in the early morning darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thoughts were, 'I'm dead! I'm dead!' " Fulton said from his Oceanside 
home. "When the truck stopped, I looked down and saw the pavement. I just 
decided to walk right through where the windshield used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Walking to safety, he saw burning debris scattered over the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe how incredibly lucky I was," he said. "It's pretty amazing. 
I feel very lucky to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Fulton, who has three children, said it took six stitches to close a cut on his 
left arm. He also suffered a scratched forehead and bloodied scalp. "Other than 
that, I just feel really sore." 
</P>
<P>
He praised the quick response of medical emergency crews and Highway Patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the accident, officers were still amazed at what they saw when they 
arrived at the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"Milk was spilled on the roadway and the (butane) cans were going off like 
fireworks," CHP Officer Burrus said. "There was a mass of smoke. It was scary, 
because no one knew what the smoke was." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said officers began shutting down portions of the freeway about 5:15 
a.m., starting with the north and southbound freeway entrances at Fairview 
Road, before closing about a 2-mile stretch between Bristol Street and Harbor 
Boulevard in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the California Department of Transportation later closed both the 
northbound and southbound access from the Costa Mesa Freeway to the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
North of the accident site, CHP officers said southbound freeway traffic was 
being diverted onto the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said firefighters from the Costa Mesa Fire Department battled the 
flames for about 30 minutes before the fire was extinguished. Hazardous 
materials teams from Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also responded to study 
the contents of the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said an inventory of the rig's cargo fully described the contents, but 
the butane hampered firefighters in their efforts to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Baker, TNT's safety supervisor, said the truck was bound for the company's 
terminal in San Diego when the accident occurred. Baker described the contents 
as "general freight" that were to be dropped off in San Diego and delivered to 
businesses there. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, a small crowd of people had gathered on the Fairview overpass 
to watch giant tow trucks right the burned-out wreckage. The remains were 
loaded on flatbed trucks and hauled away. Ellison said the force of the crash 
and fire broke Fulton's rig into three pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said the freeway's northbound lanes were opened first, about 9:30 a.m. 
Traffic was moving in both directions by 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Only minutes after traffic was allowed back on the northbound lanes, Ellison 
said officers were called to another traffic accident, involving a drunk 
driver, immediately across the center divider from the truck pileup. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just getting inundated," Ellison said. "We could not win today. We 
have to laugh because if you don't, you cry." 
</P>
<P>
Freeway openings could not have come too soon for those who were commuting to 
work Saturday and others who were stalled a frustrating few miles from John 
Wayne Airport and departing flights. 
</P>
<P>
Airline ticket agents said travelers were arriving late for their flights all 
morning because of the traffic delays created by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
A Delta Air Lines agent, who did not want to be identified, said about 10 
passengers missed their planes and were placed on later flights. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were running here completely out of breath," the woman said. "They 
were pretty nice considering the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Pam McPhall of Continental Airlines said traffic delays left other passengers 
stressed-out and airline employees late for work.

SOME KNEW RISKS OF LINCOLN'S BONDS, TESTIMONY SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFT: OTHER INVESTORS DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO READ MATERIAL PROVIDED BY 
NOW-BANKRUPT AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP., THE GRAND JURY LEARNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
There is no doubt that small investors in now-bankrupt American Continental 
Corp. were badly hurt and that many believe they were badly fooled. 
</P>
<P>
But grand jury testimony released Friday indicates that some people who bought 
some of the nearly $200 million in bonds sold at the company's Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan branches knew full well the risks of investing. And others simply 
did not take the time to read material provided. 
</P>
<P>
Those bonds now are among the worthless securities and other debris left over 
from the April, 1989, collapse of the real estate and financial empire created 
by American Continental's former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The California Grand Jury, which indicted Keating and three others in September 
on state securities fraud charges in the sale of the bonds, took testimony over 
five months from 94 witnesses, most of them bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the small investors were elderly Southern Californians persuaded by a 
high-pressure sales force to buy American Continental bonds. The investors, 
many unsophisticated in investment decisions, allege in civil litigation that 
they were misled into believing that the bonds were insured or safe, as their 
savings deposits had been. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, most of the grand jury testimony by several dozen bondholders 
paints exactly that picture. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys challenge the popular notion, for instance, that 
bondholders were told that the bonds were insured. 
</P>
<P>
Abbe David Lowell, attorney for co-defendant and former American Continental 
President Judy J. Wischer, even contends that the grand jury transcripts show 
that "witness after witness specifically said they were told the bonds were not 
insured." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony, however, shows that some salespeople used such euphemisms as 
"100% secure," "as safe as the United States of America" or "comparable to a 
certificate of deposit." 
</P>
<P>
One salesman at the S&amp;L's Lakewood branch nodded toward an emblem that 
indicated that Lincoln's deposits were federally insured and said the 
government was backing up the bonds, Long Beach bondholder Henry J. Adams, 67, 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony from dozens of bondholders shows that many were won over by 
high-pressure sales techniques and misleading statements. Many said they never 
received documents that they later learned were required by law to be given to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The primary document -- the prospectus -- is supposed to reveal the risks of 
buying the securities, indicating how safe the bonds are. But prosecutors said 
important information, such as the regulatory pressure on Lincoln, was left out 
of American Continental's prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of the painstakingly long and complex prospectus, a few 
investors simply assumed that the bonds were safe, according to grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on her husband's advice to buy the bonds, Grace Marie Young, 73, of 
Burbank testified that she never asked about the safety of the bonds, nor did 
anyone at Lincoln's Burbank branch volunteer any such information. 
</P>
<P>
She also said American Continental sent her a prospectus, but she acknowledged 
that she did not read it as carefully as she should have. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I had complete faith in Lincoln . . . and anything that transpired 
behind their doors, I just figured it was safe," Young testified. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors were wiser about the ways of stocks and bonds than others. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Eckerson, 71, of Granada Hills, for instance, had invested in mutual funds 
previously. She attended a slick American Continental seminar on its bond issue 
before buying the first of four bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Beebe, 56, of Oakhurst, Madera County, had her stockbroker to lean on 
when she saw the first "red flag" go up -- American Continental's third-quarter 
loss in 1988. Following his advice, she persuaded the company to return her 
$20,000 investment in full. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors also were nearly sold on the idea of buying bonds before they 
ever entered Lincoln branches. 
</P>
<P>
Some relied on advertising, which prosecutors maintain was misleading mainly 
because it failed to point out that the bonds were not insured. But others 
relied as much on outside factors as on anything that salespeople could tell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dorothy Archer, 69, of Rancho Palos Verdes was influenced by her 
brother-in-law, who was a bondholder. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so impressed with receiving his check on the 28th of every month, you 
know," she testified. "So I was more or less talked into it by him." 
</P>
<P>
And Harriet S. Chappuis, 65, of Los Angeles, said a 1988 Forbes magazine story 
saying American Continental was stable and its bonds good was as much a factor 
in her bond purchase as the insistence by salespeople that the bonds were safe. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders' testimony is only part of the jigsaw puzzle that prosecutors 
must put together for a jury at trial. Their main effort will be to link any 
false or misleading statements or improper omissions with Keating, Wischer and 
the other two defendants, Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes, both of whom were 
Lincoln presidents.

INCUMBENTS FACE TEST OF VOTER REVOLT; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOTS: ORANGE COUNTY IS TRADITIONALLY A SAFE HAVEN FOR THE STATUS QUO, BUT 
SEVERAL OFFICEHOLDERS RISK BEING TOSSED BY THE STORM OF DISSATISFACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents are among the happiest, most optimistic in California, 
polls show, and when it comes to voting for new policies or candidates they 
usually like to keep things just the way they are. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, the scandals and fiascoes that have rocked Washington and 
Sacramento are buffeting the Orange County electorate as they are voters 
everywhere else. Orange County residents are mad too, but are they mad enough 
to vote for change on Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not, some local experts say. They may be unhappy with the performance 
of their government, but they don't blame their local representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong anti-incumbent feeling here," said Republican consultant 
Harvey Englander. "But it's not that my assemblyman or my councilman is bad -- 
they're all bad." 
</P>
<P>
But Eileen Padberg, also a Republican strategist, said she expects this race to 
reveal some signs that Orange County voters are ready to express their 
frustration at the polls. There were already indications, she said, in the June 
primary when an unknown candidate who never campaigned still managed to score 
about 40% of the vote against Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will see the beginning of anti-incumbency feelings," Padberg said. 
"I would not want to be a countywide incumbent up this year." 
</P>
<P>
There are a handful of races on Tuesday's ballot that will test voter 
sentiment: 
</P>
<P>
* Harriett M. Wieder is the first incumbent Orange County supervisor to be 
forced into a runoff election in 10 years. Still, she is the odds-on favorite 
against the little-known and under-funded Joy L. Neugebauer, a city 
councilwoman in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
* Mike Capizzi, who was appointed district attorney by the supervisors earlier 
this year, is in a close race against his office colleague, James Enright, the 
county's chief deputy district attorney. Capizzi is backed by the full force of 
Orange County's Republican Establishment, but he was slightly behind Enright in 
a recent Times Orange County poll. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Peterson, Orange County schools superintendent for 24 years, was 
outpolled for the first time in his career when Whittier College professor John 
F. Dean finished first in the June primary and forced the incumbent into a 
runoff. But like the district attorney's race, polls find many voters are still 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
* Curt Pringle, the Republican assemblyman from Garden Grove, is in 
California's most hotly contested race for the Legislature as he faces 
Democratic challenger Tom Umberg. This race appears to be coming down to the 
wire and, with about 50 pieces of mail sent by the two campaigns, much of it 
filled with attacks, it has become an ugly brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County voters will also be asked for the third time whether they want a 
sales tax increase to help pay for such transportation improvements as road 
construction and rail transit. The latest version of Measure M is a half-cent 
sales tax almost identical to the one that lost at the polls last November, 53% 
to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to local races, Orange County voters are expected to play a key 
role in many statewide contests. 
</P>
<P>
All of the GOP statewide candidates need a strong showing in Republican-rich 
Orange County, but gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's forces have conducted 
an especially aggressive campaign in the area. The state and county Republican 
parties have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to register voters, and 
they have opened several party headquarters throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
In the search for votes, they have recently hosted President Bush, Vice 
President Dan Quayle and former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The rule of thumb for Republican strategists is that their candidates need to 
win in Orange County by a margin of at least 200,000 votes to offset Democratic 
majorities in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A poll last week prepared for The Times found Wilson leading Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein 2 to 1 in Orange County, well ahead of the 200,000-vote margin he has 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans weren't doing as well, however. The poll found Orange 
County's own state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) running against 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, just short of the margin she should have 
in Orange County. Compared to earlier polls, though, she had substantially 
increased her lead over the incumbent among Orange County voters. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is home to one other candidate on the statewide campaign trail -- 
Wes Bannister, the Republican nominee for state insurance commissioner. 
Bannister is a city councilman from Huntington Beach who is facing state Sen. 
John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove). 
</P>
<P>
On some of the major statewide propositions, Orange County also appeared to be 
voting with the rest of the state, according to polls. Proposition 128, called 
"Big Green" by supporters and the "Hayden Initiative" by critics, was slightly 
ahead but still a close contest. 
</P>
<P>
And the two propositions that would limit terms of state lawmakers were both 
supported by about two-thirds of the Orange County electorate, a reflection of 
voters' unhappiness with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Seven in 10 voters even favored a two-term limit for county supervisors, 
although such a proposal is not on the ballot. The sentiment, however, led 
pollster Mark Baldassare to conclude that voters are "not terribly thrilled 
with the job that anyone's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers believe the frustration and negative campaign 
advertising will deter voters, leading to predictions of an abnormally low 
turnout, possibly around 50% of those registered. County Registrar of Voters 
Donald Tanney has predicted a 55% to 60% turnout, just below what it has been 
in Orange County in the last two gubernatorial races. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney said there are some key races and issues on the ballot to draw voters 
out, but he added: "There are no crystal balls. (Voters) are concerned about 
the length of the ballot and the complexity of the issues and that could have a 
negative effect on turnout too." 
</P>
<P>
The five Republican congressmen who represent Orange County will appear on 
Tuesday's ballot, but none are thought to be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
One Orange County state senator, Ed Royce (R-Anaheim), will also be seeking 
reelection against Democrat Evelyn Colon Becktell. 
</P>
<P>
And all eight of Orange County's assembly seats will be on the ballot. One race 
of consequence is in the 58th Assembly District, where a new legislator will be 
chosen to fill a vacancy left by the resignation of Assemblyman Dennis Brown 
(R-Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, a Republican, won a heated primary in June and 
is facing Democrat Luanne W. Pryor of Long Beach. The heavily Republican 
district stretches along the county's coast from Huntington Beach into Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the other Assembly races, the only incumbent who appears in serious jeopardy 
is Pringle, whose district includes Stanton and parts of Santa Ana, 
Westminster, Garden Grove and Anaheim. In fact, both state parties consider the 
race for Pringle's 72nd Assembly District seat to be the most hotly contested 
legislative contest in California. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the race has seen a massive, all-out campaign from both parties, 
particularly Republicans. Any registered voter in this district has heard 
plenty about this race -- some may say too much. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigns have sent out at least 50 pieces of mail, sometimes giving voters 
up to four letters in one day. In addition, independent expenditure committees 
campaigning for their candidate have added dozens of more letters, posters and 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, 31, has relied heavily on an appeal that portrays him as a vital 
member of the Republican Party who is essential to achieving the GOP's goals. 
That message has been delivered by such major Republican personalities as 
Quayle, who made two visits for Pringle, Gov. George Deukmejian and Reagan, who 
was in Garden Grove on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg, on the other hand, has attempted to disconnect himself from the 
Democratic Party, saying that he would not hesitate to challenge the Sacramento 
leadership to get tougher crime laws. Umberg, a 35-year-old former federal 
prosecutor, has rarely made any public appearances with party officials or 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The two have also demonstrated some key differences. They are split on 
abortion, Pringle opposes abortion rights and Umberg supports them. Pringle has 
also endorsed Proposition 140, to limit terms of state lawmakers, while Umberg 
opposes it. And Umberg favors the Big Green environmental proposition, while 
Pringle opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
Another race with high stakes is Wieder's bid for a fourth term as the county 
supervisor from Huntington Beach against Westminster Councilwoman Neugebauer. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent supervisors in Orange County are usually considered almost unbeatable 
because of their access to huge campaign war chests and partly because of the 
low profile of their office, especially in urban parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's race will be watched closely for indications that the supervisors are 
no longer so insulated. But despite being forced into a runoff, she still 
appears to be a favorite for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder is endorsed by every mayor and most city council members of the cities 
within her district: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress, 
Stanton, Garden Grove and Westminster. And she has an enormous advantage in 
money, spending more than $300,000 compared to Neugebauer's $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, who has served on the Westminster City Council for 18 years, is 
counting on anti-incumbent votes and leftover bad feelings from Wieder's 1988 
bid for Congress when she admitted to lying about receiving a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer has mounted a grass-roots, volunteer-based campaign, much like the 
low-budget productions that have won her election to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen, and there is an air of anti-incumbency," said political 
consultant Englander. "But I think Harriett will pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
The race for district attorney pits two longtime interoffice rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, the office's chief deputy, is trying to unseat Capizzi, the former 
chief assistant who was appointed district attorney by the Board of Supervisors 
earlier this year when Cecil Hicks, the former officeholder, became a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi has emphasized his accomplishments and long list of endorsements. 
Enright, meanwhile, has tried to paint a sharp contrast between himself as a 
courtroom prosecutor and Capizzi as just an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, 63, sees Capizzi as a young upstart who has done more over the years 
to polish his image with politicians than effectively prosecute crimes. 
Capizzi, 50, considers Enright a wasted talent, a man who lacks the 
administrative abilities to effectively lead the district attorney's office 
during the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
Those sorts of office squabbles have surfaced repeatedly during the campaign, 
generating the most intrigue in a race that has otherwise failed to capture the 
attention of the public. A recent poll for The Times Orange County Edition 
showed that nearly half of the voters in the county were still undecided in 
this race. Among the others, the race was nearly even, with Enright leading 
Capizzi 29% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi has an advantage in being the incumbent, and he has much more money, 
$263,000 compared to Enright's $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in one more race where an incumbent is running hard, County School 
Supt. Peterson is facing his first serious challenge since he was elected in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's opponent is Whittier College professor Dean, 63, who combined with 
another candidate in the June primary to capture 60% of the vote. That result, 
Dean has said, is a mandate from the electorate for "new leadership" in the 
nonpartisan, $98,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
But as Tuesday's election approaches, Dean has not managed to parlay that 
mandate into a clear shot at victory. Results of the Times Orange County Poll 
last week showed that 50% of the voters have yet to decide whether to return 
Peterson to office for an unprecedented seventh term or make Dean the first new 
face to occupy the county superintendent's office since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
With campaign funds dwindling in both camps -- the two candidates had only 
about $7,000 in their respective war chests at last count -- Peterson and Dean 
will have to rely on volunteer precinct walking and word-of-mouth to garner 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Dean has the advantage of being endorsed by the 15,000-member California 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues, Dean says he will seek to rein in the county Department of 
Education's "skyrocketing" $74.5-million budget and will attempt to reallocate 
funds. Dean has also been sharply critical of what he calls Peterson's "games 
and contests" mentality. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has argued that Dean's campaign promises are naive. Budget allocation, 
Peterson has said, are strictly controlled by state law and cannot be easily 
changed by the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Bob Schwertz, Tony Marcano and Eric Bailey contributed to 
this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Election Ballot 
</P>
<P>
Voters will face a lengthy ballot featuring numerous issues and candidates at 
the state, county, municipal and special district levels when they go to the 
polls in Tuesday's General Election. 
</P>
<P>
In the statewide contests, voters will decide races for governor, lieutenant 
governor, secretary of state, controller, treasurer, attorney general and 
insurance commissioner. In addition, there are 28 ballot initiatives, including 
the sweeping and controversial Proposition 128, also known as "Big Green," and 
Propositions 131 and 140, which seek to set term limits on state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Orange County voters will decide on Measure M, a proposed half-cent 
sales-tax increase to fund transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
They will also decide whether to return to office a county supervisor, the 
district attorney and the county superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also on local ballots are 24 city council elections, 14 school board elections, 
16 special district elections and 14 legislative and congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
Polls will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.

SCHOOL MARCHING BANDS TAKE THE FIELD TO WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Sharman, a 16-year-old sousaphone player from Laguna Beach, is proof of 
the power of mental visualization. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Laguna Beach Artists high school marching band paraded onto the 
football field during a marching band competition at Orange Coast College on 
Saturday afternoon, director Jeff Foster ordered the musicians to close their 
eyes and meditate quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concentrating on the music," whispered the sousaphone player, lifting his 
head up briefly to explain to the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Sharman was swaggering on the field, deftly improvising a 
sousaphone solo as the 27-member marching band and drill team performed a 
snappy version of a rock 'n' roll number. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really get that nervous," Jeff said later. "I don't think about the 
people watching." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach High School band was one of 32 high school marching bands and 
drill teams from Southern California and Las Vegas to compete in the fourth 
annual South Coast Invitational Field Band Tournament at Orange Coast College's 
LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored jointly by the Orange Coast College Community Services department and 
the Costa Mesa High School band boosters, the event has grown each year in 
reputation, and promoters say they hope it will one day be one of the premiere 
competitions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly a quality event," Orange Coast College spokeswoman Marge Ball said, 
adding that the two sponsors each expected to collect about $1,000 from ticket 
sales and entrance fees. "To have this many bands here is a compliment. It's a 
fun time for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
But it was more than fun for the high school performers, some of whom drove for 
hours in cramped yellow buses to compete in the tourney. It was serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Each band was scheduled to perform for 15 minutes, offering its best 1990 
halftime show to the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at attention on a practice field just before their performance, the 
Buena Park High School Marching Band members repeatedly played several 
difficult passages of the "Flintstones" theme song. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to get the sound out and project more," yelled director Dan 
Kalantarian to the 37 green-uniformed players forming a triangle in front of 
him. "It's not enough to put the fingers down. Now keep your horns up." 
</P>
<P>
Although it was the Buena Park high school band's first year in the 
competition, drum major and lead trumpeter James Quorion said that the ensemble 
has "been getting a lot of respect. He (Kalantarian) has really helped us put 
this band together." 
</P>
<P>
The competition lasted all day as the bands, divided into six categories, 
marched in intricate formations, their instruments glittering under the sun 
that heated the fall day to a comfortable 75 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The stands were filled with parents and friends of the performers. Some 
boosters found it hard to choose a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Davis, a Buena Park junior high school teacher, watched eagerly on the 
stands as her son, a trumpeter from the Sunny Hills High School band, 
performed. Some of her former students were performing with the Buena Park High 
School band. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty funny," she said. "My own kid is with this one (band), and my 
other kids are over there."

TUSTIN GOES HOLLYWOOD WITH 'CHINA CRY'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several thousand of the faithful and the curious gathered at a shopping mall 
here Saturday for a Hollywood-style promotion of "China Cry," a feature film 
produced by Tustin television evangelist Paul F. Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
Such a glitzy event -- complete with remote broadcasts, rap singers and a movie 
star -- might be standard procedure in the movie business, but Saturday's 
razzle-dazzle was one of the few traditional things about Crouch's venture into 
the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
"China Cry," which premiered last week at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood 
and opened in more than 25 U.S. cities, is the inspirational story of San Jose 
evangelist Nora Lam. Based on Lam's autobiography, it tells her story of her 
transformation from a pampered Shanghai girl in pre-revolutionary China to a 
Christian who was persecuted and almost executed for her faith by communist 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"China Cry" was financed by $6 million in donations from viewers of 
Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network. It has been strongly promoted around 
the country by affiliates of the 24-hour-a-day Christian programming service, 
which Crouch founded in Orange County in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch, who served as the film's executive producer, joined "China Cry" co-star 
Russell Wong on Saturday at the Tustin Market Place for the daylong event. The 
shopping center is just across the Santa Ana Freeway from Trinity's 
headquarters and flagship television station, KTBN Channel 40, which broadcast 
the day's events across the country and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
While the festivities continued throughout the day in the parking lot, the film 
was shown on all six screens from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. at a multiplex theater 
nearby, one of a dozen theaters in the county exhibiting "China Cry." Many who 
watched the film bought tickets in advance through Trinity, according to Scott 
Tiveron, assistant manager of the theater complex, Edwards Market Place. As 
part of the distributor's marketing strategy, more than $215,000 in advance 
tickets was sold to Trinity viewers at a 20% discount. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Genovese, a regular Trinity viewer, drove from Simi Valley to see the 
movie and found it "terrific. It shows you that if you have faith in God, He 
can pull you through anything." 
</P>
<P>
But not all of those who saw the movie Saturday were regular Trinity viewers. 
Shelley Westmore of Tustin said she came because of the previews she saw 
earlier at the theater, and was not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to a lot of movies," she said. "China Cry" is "not one of the greatest 
ones I've seen, but I thought it was well done." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Claire Westmore, said the film was "disjointed in parts, unlike 
bigger-budget productions, but it was a good story." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the film's PG-13 rating, there were a number of children in a ticket 
line of several hundred for the 2 p.m. show. The reason for the rating was the 
film's "emotional intensity," according to Tim Penland, distributor of "China 
Cry." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch has told Trinity viewers that he didn't like to see "China Cry" in the 
same category with films that featured nudity, profanity and gratuitous 
violence. He said Saturday that although he felt the PG-13 rating was 
"excessive," he did not appeal the rating. 
</P>
<P>
While Trinity has promoted, financed and sold tickets for "China Cry," Crouch 
and Penland have chosen to offer the picture to general audiences like any 
other commercial release, and let it sink or swim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right out there on a limb," Crouch acknowledged. If "China Cry" doesn't 
draw enough paying customers, theater owners will swiftly replace it. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, evangelists such as Billy Graham, who have made similar films, 
have hedged their investments by "four-walling" them, renting theaters and 
selling tickets through churches and other religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Should "China Cry" earn back its cost or make a profit, Crouch has pledged to 
make more such films. Projects under consideration range from the story of 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian hanged by the Nazis for plotting 
against Hitler, to the lives of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Crouch said.

NOTEBOOK: A VISION OF DECAY, NEGLECT IS REVISITED

<P>
On the morning after three young men were shot and killed outside the Fairview 
Villas apartment complex last week, a toddler played "hide-and-go-seek" outside 
her family's apartment. Dashing in and out of the bushes, she was just 100 
yards from the public telephones where the men were gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
The child seemed oblivious to the slayings and to the occasional crowd that 
gathered at the site to look at the bloodstains that marked the death scene. As 
I walked past the girl, I couldn't help but think of my own childhood. My 
family lived in a rough section of Jersey City, N.J., a neighborhood that 
slowly decayed as families, able to afford the suburbs, moved away. Those who 
were on low incomes stayed behind -- along with the drug dealers and hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Santa Ana, I thought of this child growing up as I did, stuck in a 
neighborhood where crime is common and drugs are a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
I was a 5-year-old when my family moved to Jersey City. My parents had saved 
enough money to buy a tiny laundry on Jackson Avenue, which was once the 
premier shopping district in Jersey City. 
</P>
<P>
When my family moved to Jackson Avenue in the late 1960s, there were already 
signs of suburban flight. Still, we didn't care. At the time, we were only too 
happy to live in our own place. Though the neighborhood was still relatively 
safe and lively when we moved in, there was already a handful of storefronts 
closing down. 
</P>
<P>
Our laundry was between an A&amp;P supermarket and a Dairy Queen. On my block, 
there was a bakery that sold Italian cookies and flavored ices. At the corner, 
there was a drugstore that served egg creams and malts as well as a fruit stand 
where customers picked produce from the stalls. Everyone in the neighborhood 
knew my family, particularly my father. He was always cleaning the concrete in 
front of the shop with a bucket of water and an old broom. 
</P>
<P>
As I grew up, I watched my neighborhood change. Residents moved away and 
merchants boarded up their storefronts with plywood. Within a few years, most 
of the merchants and stores were gone. The only exceptions were my family's 
laundry, a corner liquor store and the Dairy Queen, which became a fortress, 
encased in security bars and bulletproof windows. Gradually, dope dealers, 
addicts and hustlers made Jackson Avenue their home. 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike residents in Santa Ana around Fairview Villas, my family found 
itself changing with the neighborhood. We added extra locks to our doors and 
got a watchdog. We tried not to go out alone at night. Every time my mom came 
home from work, we waited for her by the bus stop. Muggings were the most 
frequent crime in the neighborhood. Even with such precautions, we didn't 
escape the crime. Muggers robbed my father of $1 when he went to buy a quart of 
milk from the liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
There's never a precise moment when a neighborhood goes bad. One day, Jackson 
Avenue seemed like a dream location for us. Then suddenly, it was the only 
place in which we could afford to live. 
</P>
<P>
My family was finally able to move away when I was a teen-ager. Now when I 
visit home, I drive by the old neighborhood for a shortcut. On a good day, I 
might think of the better memories, like the smell of Italian cookies. But more 
often than not, I drive very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In my recent tour of Fairview Villas, I couldn't help but think of Jackson 
Avenue. I learned that this complex was once the most sought-after address in 
the city. In the past year, the apartment management, police and city officials 
have worked hard to get rid of crime in the area. But still, crime has a way of 
permeating the neighborhood. And the apartment residents, many of whom cannot 
afford to live elsewhere, are struck by how close a brutal crime can get. 
</P>
<P>
I looked at that little girl and wondered what kind of memories she will have 
when she is older. Would she think of playing "hide-and-go-seek" in front of 
her home or of the day when three men were shot dead 100 yards away from her 
family's apartment?

CAMPAIGN: DANA ROHRABACHER HAS SWAMPED CHALLENGER GUY C. KIMBROUGH IN 
FUND-RAISING AND SPENDING. OTHER REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE SIMILAR FINANCIAL 
POWER.

<P>
In what arguably is the hottest of Orange County's congressional races, 
incumbent Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) is outspending his Democratic 
opponent by a margin of 19 to 1, campaign records show. 
</P>
<P>
Between Jan. 1, 1989, and Oct. 17, 1990, Rohrabacher raised $366,982 and spent 
$288,325, compared to $13,844 and $14,901, respectively, for Democratic 
challenger Guy C. Kimbrough. A college professor, Kimbrough began raising money 
earlier this year for his rematch with Rohrabacher in the 42nd Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an independent fund-raising group that is seeking to unseat 
Rohrabacher said it has raised only $8,000 to $9,000, which it intends to use 
to pay for a series of anti-Rohrabacher advertisements airing on cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Rohrabacher filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election 
Commission because the group, the Southern California Coalition for Responsible 
Government, had not yet filed financial reports required by federal law. A 
spokesman for the organization said it would move quickly to correct any 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lopsided fund-raising and spending totals, the 
Rohrabacher-Kimbrough race has attracted the most interest in Orange County 
because of the national attention Rohrabacher received when he launched an 
attack on purportedly pornographic and sacrilegious artwork funded by the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange County congressional races, the only challenger who has filed 
an FEC report, required when a candidate raises more than $5,000, is Democrat 
Eugene C. Gratz of Laguna Beach, who is challenging Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) in the 40th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, Gratz had raised $31,754 and spent $21,150, according to his 
most recent report to the FEC. Gratz said he has spent most of his money on 
Democratic "party-building" activities, such as voter registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who has spent much of the 1990 election cycle raising money to pay off the 
$334,298 debt from his 1988 campaign, collected $609,754 between Jan. 1, 1989, 
and Oct. 17, 1990, and spent $508,158, including debt repayment. His 
outstanding debt remains at $114,619. 
</P>
<P>
Gratz, a real estate attorney, had $7,034 in the bank as of Sept. 30, while Cox 
had $47,475 on hand on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
No financial statements were filed by the announced challengers to Reps. 
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) in the 39th District, which comprises 
northeastern Orange County, Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) in the 43rd District, 
which includes southern Orange County, and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in 
the 38th District in north-central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Jackson, Dornan's Democratic opponent, announced her withdrawal from 
the campaign before the primary election, but her name remains on the Tuesday 
ballot. Dannemeyer is running against Democrat Francis X. Hoffman of Garden 
Grove, while Packard is opposed by Libertarian Richard L. Arnold and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Doug Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
A second Rohrabacher challenger, Libertarian Richard Gibb Martin, also is among 
the challengers who did not file FEC finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents, however, have raised and spent significant amounts of money. 
Dornan listed contributions of $1.4 million since Jan. 1, 1989, and 
expenditures of $1.2 million, most of it on his direct-mail fund-raising 
operation. Dornan reported no debts and $209,591 in the bank as of Sept. 30. 
Dannemeyer has raised $393,693 and spent $313,939, largely on direct-mail 
fund-raising. He reported no debt and $90,469 in the bank as of Oct. 17. 
Packard has raised $97,387 and spent $56,060 by Oct. 17. He reported no debt 
and cash on hand of $209,380. 
</P>
<P>
In the 42nd District race, Kimbrough, chairman of the political science program 
for the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District, lost to Rohrabacher in the 
1988 general election by a margin of 34% to 65%. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week, Kimbrough said his spending will approach 
$60,000 by Tuesday, including a $26,000 "in-kind" contribution of ready-made 
television ads from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Not all of 
the ads will be aired, however. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough will use much of his money to air 30- and 60-second spots about 200 
times on local cable television stations. The ads attack Rohrabacher for 
supporting offshore oil drilling and favoring content restrictions on art 
funded by the NEA. In addition to the cable TV ads, Kimbrough said he also is 
sending out 43,000 campaign mail pieces over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In one direct-mail piece sent by Rohrabacher, and in two others that are on 
their way, the first-term congressman is pitching himself as a fiscal 
conservative who fights wasteful government spending and strongly supports the 
local aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Coalition for Responsible Government, the 
anti-Rohrabacher group organized largely because of the congressman's attempts 
to impose content restrictions on NEA-funded art, is spending about $5,000 to 
air cable television ads, said spokesman Michael Nash. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the FEC released Friday, the Rohrabacher campaign asked for an 
investigation of the coalition's failure to file required campaign finance 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been slinging a lot of arrows in my direction," Rohrabacher said in an 
interview. "If they're going to get involved in the political system like that, 
they should realize there are certain rules, both legal rules and ethical 
rules, that they should be following." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that there's not a problem," responded Nash. "If there is, we will take 
care of it. I think it's typical of the Rohrabacher campaign to try to distract 
the voters with non-issues and technicalities, rather than to address the real 
concerns of the district."

Rolling toward Los Angeles at deep dusk, Amtrak engineer Ken Galusha strains to 
spot signs of life on the track ahead of him. "It's almost dark and all I can 
see is a white T-shirt," he says, recalling one image that sticks with him. A 
burst from the whistle persuades the vague figure to abandon the track to the 
onrushing train. 
</P>
<P>
Such brief scares are typical of the railroad engineer's workday, in which long 
stretches of routine are occasionally punctuated by random unpleasant 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Monotony, excitement and stress go hand in hand in the engineer's cab. The 
romantic notion of the engineer's life gets lost in a clutter of regulations, 
signals and schedules, all intended to deliver passengers as quickly and safely 
as possible, and without threatening the lives of anyone in the vicinity of the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 trains a day rumble over the Santa Fe tracks between Los Angeles and 
San Diego, and some residents treat them casually. 
</P>
<P>
Galusha has learned to assume that surfers will be crossing the long trestle in 
San Clemente as he approaches, and he cuts loose early with the whistle to 
encourage them to scramble to safety. "They'll get down between the girders," 
he says. "I know I've saved a lot of lives with the whistle." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time the whistle does the trick. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
The latest complete figures from the Federal Railroad Administration report 103 
deaths in California in 1988 resulting from trespassing, grade crossings, 
collisions and derailments. Since the beginning of this year, one man has been 
killed and another seriously injured by trains in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
When someone doesn't budge from the track, Galusha's only other option is to 
hit the full emergency stop and hope for the best. There's no dodging to the 
left or right, or stopping on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally helpless if I'm going 90 miles an hour," the 41-year-old engineer 
says. "It tears at you because you know you can't do much." 
</P>
<P>
At 90 m.p.h., the train would take half a mile to stop. "It's like a roller 
coaster. There's no friction on those steel wheels. Not like rubber tires," 
says Louis Pescevic, an engineer who lives in Mira Loma. 
</P>
<P>
A grisly evaluation determines whether the train can proceed after someone is 
killed. If the body is still in one piece, the train doesn't have to wait for 
the coroner to arrive. Otherwise, it waits, and that can take as long as three 
hours in the more deserted reaches along the coast, says engineer Ernie Hull of 
El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Too many drivers stuck on the tracks freeze and don't abandon their cars as a 
train approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Pescevic recalls hitting a truck that got "high-centered" trying to drive 
around the gates at the crossing. "He was smart enough to get out of the 
truck," he says "Don't try to save your car; save your life." 
</P>
<P>
If a train is a threat to the unwary, it is also a king-size target for 
youngsters. Children will throw rocks at the trains. "I'm rocked probably once 
or twice a month," Galusha says. From time to time he has had his windshield 
shattered. "It sounds like an M-80 or a shotgun going off. At night they come 
out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Children also like to pile junk on the track to see what impact the train will 
have. Pescevic has hit ladders, rubber tires, shopping carts, couches and even 
a refrigerator. "You hit a refrigerator at 90 miles an hour and it does tend to 
fly," Pescevic says. 
</P>
<P>
Marines at Camp Pendleton and youngsters have been known to play chicken with 
passing trains. Most will jump out of the way before the train gets too close, 
but others will wait too long. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is the kids along the railroad tracks," Galusha says. "I've 
been real lucky I haven't hit anybody. I've had close calls." With three 
children of his own, the sight of youngsters meandering too close to the tracks 
makes him nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Galusha, who is from Riverside, has been an engineer for 10 years. Because of 
his seniority, he usually gets his first choice when schedules are changed 
every six months. On Thursdays and Fridays he runs the San Diegan from Los 
Angeles to San Diego at 4:45 p.m. After a 80-minute layover in San Diego, he 
returns to Los Angeles, arriving at 11:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday nights, Galusha leaves Los Angeles at 8:30 p.m., in charge of the 
first leg of the Amtrak's train to Chicago. After arriving in Kingman, Ariz. at 
4:30 a.m., his crew has a 19-hour layover before joining the westbound 12:16 
a.m. train, which arrives in Los Angeles at 7:47 a.m. He particularly enjoys 
the run to Kingman, Galusha says. "The desert has its own kind of serenity." 
</P>
<P>
Serenity is a scarce commodity for engineers. The engines are loud, and 
engineers must wear earplugs. They are in continual quest of 100% on-time 
performance, but delays of two or three minutes at a couple of stations can put 
the train so far behind schedule that it will miss its "meet" with an oncoming 
train and wind up routed to a siding to wait. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers are constantly being tested. 
</P>
<P>
One engineer estimates that Amtrak and the railroads challenge their engineers 
15 or 20 times a month with procedures designed to warn the engineer to slow or 
stop. And each engine has an "alerter" that the engineer must touch every 30 or 
40 seconds or the train will stop. The alerter has largely replaced the 
dead-man switch, which could be bypassed with a wrench or flag stick. Bypassing 
the alerter can bring a $10,000 to $25,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak trains its engineers in a simulator in Chicago. Prospective engineers go 
through a six-week training session, and then return home for six months of 
on-the-job training. After four more weeks in Chicago, they go through a final 
qualification period. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the engineers got their training on other railroads. Galusha attended 
Santa Fe's training center in Topeka, Kan., where he studied the mechanical 
workings of the train, learned train handling and memorized the line's 
operating rules. "You have to know the rules word for word," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on seniority and the number 
of hours they work, says Arthur Lloyd, director of public relations for Amtrak 
in the west. He says a total of 108 engineers operate out of Los Angeles and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A regular change of scenery appeals to Pescevic. Every six months he chooses a 
different route. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the variety, and it keeps you current with all the railroad rules," he 
says, pointing out that an Amtrak train must also follow the operating 
regulations of the Santa Fe, Union Pacific or Southern Pacific railroads, 
depending on the track they're using. The regulations cover roughly 1,100 miles 
of track and 117 block signals, and engineers must have an intimate knowledge 
of the speeds, grades and block signals on the track they cover. 
</P>
<P>
Pescevic, 40, has been with Amtrak for 12 years. Working as an engineer is 
something of a family tradition; Pescevic's father and grandfather were both 
railroad men. For years, Pescevic had no interest in following them, but at 28 
he tired of working for a supermarket chain and joined the Santa Fe Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stressful job, but it's a job I enjoy. You get to see a lot. It's a 
different job. I guess that's what makes it exciting," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, 55, has been working railroads for 37 years. For 33 years he worked 
mostly freight between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. Now, his usual shift has 
him leaving San Diego at 6:20 a.m. and arriving in Los Angeles at 9:10 a.m. 
During a three-hour layover at Union Station he walks, reads the newspaper, or 
goes for something to eat before reboarding and heading south, arriving in San 
Diego at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After a long career in the cab, Hull is no stranger to accidents. "Last year I 
had a bad year; I hit three or four cars and a couple of trespassers," he says. 
"Three people were killed. That's a lot more than usual." 
</P>
<P>
On southbound journeys, engineers keep watch in a lead cab car -- which is a 
beefed-up coach -- and the engine pushes from behind. The setup saves three or 
four minutes in Los Angeles, and 25 to 30 minutes in San Diego because the 
trains don't have to be turned around before they depart the station. But some 
engineers feel that the cab cars are susceptible to derailment in a collision 
and that anyone riding in the car faces a greater chance of injury in an 
accident. Amtrak management disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
Once Hull's seven-car train was heading southbound at 70 m.p.h. It came over a 
rise and from the cab car Hull saw a car sitting on the tracks about an eighth 
of a mile in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
Hull hit the emergency stop and scrambled back to the passenger compartment to 
put distance between himself and the collision. The train hit the car at about 
50 m.p.h., impaling it on the engine's front knuckler draw bar. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the train suffered little damage. 
</P>
<P>
Pescevic says driving from the cab car is comfortable, and the car is 
air-conditioned. It's also quiet, for the most part, although when the brake 
valve bleeds right next to the engineer, it does so very loudly. 
</P>
<P>
There's an upsurge of interest in trains for commuter transportation in 
Southern California, and Hull is optimistic about the service. He says he has 
seen a large increase just in the four years he has been with Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
Pescevic says he thinks that people will eventually see "buck-and-a-quarter 
rides," meaning trains hitting 125 m.p.h. on the San Diego run, although that 
would require the installation of a new signal system. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm for being an engineer lasts about a dozen years, say the 
engineers, and it's only a few who really love the job who stay with it. Many 
go on to management jobs with the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 30 years as an engineer, Hull says he doesn't care for the 
monotony of the job, but other than that he likes it. "It pays fairly well. The 
engineer still has quite a bit of freedom," he says. "He's still mainly his own 
boss."

ENTERTAINMENT: BALBOA CINEMA'S CAST OF CHARACTERS MAKE A SHOW OF IMITATING ART 
AND "DEVIRGINIZING" FIRST-TIMERS AT THE WEEKLY "ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW." 
</P>

<P>
Forget about buying Milk Duds and buttered popcorn for this movie. You're 
better off with an umbrella. Or if you want to get in on the action, bring some 
rice, slices of toast and a cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry that the movie won't be shown in Dolby Stereo, either, because you 
won't be hearing much of the dialogue. Instead, almost everyone in the theater 
will be too busy shouting responses to the film's script. 
</P>
<P>
This is "Rocky Horror Picture Show," a weekend tradition at about 175 theaters 
across the country. Since 1978, the Balboa Cinema has been the Orange County 
home of the zany movie where fans arrive in costume and movie-goers bring 
scenes to life with props, such as rice thrown during a wedding scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror" is more a performance than a movie, because during screenings, 
art imitates art. A "cast" of volunteers stands on the Balboa's small stage and 
acts out the scenes shown on the screen behind them. 
</P>
<P>
As an appetizer, "virgins," those who have never seen the movie before, are 
sacrificed. They are brought on stage to be embarrassed for the audience's 
amusement, before being allowed to return to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the madcap weirdness that brings 200 to 300 people to the 
Balboa, week after week, for midnight shows on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different from going to a movie and just sitting there. For once, you 
were part of the experience, you were responsible for creating the fun," said 
Bill Ung, explaining why he kept coming back to see the movie after first 
attending almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Huntington Beach engineer now plays a Transylvanian with 
Midnight Insanity, the cast that rehearses twice a week and acts out scenes on 
Saturday nights. There is also a separate Friday-night cast. 
</P>
<P>
The film is about an accidental encounter between a clean-cut, sexually 
repressed couple, Brad and Janet, and a castle full of Transylvanian 
conventioneers from the planet Transsexual. When head transvestite Dr. 
Frank-N-Furter arrives on the scene, Brad and Janet fall under his spell. 
</P>
<P>
The movie flopped when it was first released in 1975. But when marketed as a 
midnight movie, it quickly grew in popularity and now is shown across the 
country. To celebrate its 15th anniversary in October, 20th Century Fox held a 
party in Hollywood for fans and stars of the movie. Attendees of Balboa 
screenings also held their own local party with cake, prizes and a costume 
contest at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The degree of antics varies from theater to theater. And the Balboa, the only 
theater in Orange County showing the film, has a firm reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have been there tell me it's a terrific show, and as good as any of 
them that are around," said Tim Deegan, the film's publicist and the man who 
originated the idea of showing "Rocky Horror" as a midnight movie. "There's a 
lot of young, fresh talent at the Balboa, which is very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
But the glory doesn't all go to the cast. This is an audience-participation 
movie, something that developed spontaneously in theaters shortly after "Rocky 
Horror" began showing at midnight, Deegan said. 
</P>
<P>
There's a running commentary from the audience that begins almost as soon as 
the first screen character speaks. When Frank-N-Furter pauses when saying, 
"anticipation," the audience calls out for him to finish: "Say it!" 
</P>
<P>
When Brad walks past his car's flat tire, just before he moves his foot, the 
audience reminds him to "Kick it!" 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Cinema manager Mike Peterson says the yelling is a chance for people to 
express themselves without fear of ridicule. A funny line can make the audience 
burst into laughter. "And if it doesn't work, no one knows where you are," 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
For filmgoer Mike Herron, a 17-year-old high school student from Santa Fe 
Springs, "Rocky Horror" is a cathartic experience. "It's the only place where 
you can yell in a movie. It releases all your stress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only vocal. The audience also aids in making screen events real. When 
rice is thrown at the film's wedding, rice is also being tossed across the 
theater. When it rains in the movie, it pours inside the cinema as audience 
members squeeze the triggers on their squirt bottles. Likewise, when 
Frank-N-Furter offers a toast at dinner, bread goes airborne. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Transylvanians all do the Time Warp dance, the audience dances 
along. 
</P>
<P>
The uninitiated might find all the craziness a little intimidating. In line on 
a recent Saturday night, four "Rocky" virgins looked as if they were having 
second thoughts. While others around them were decked out in costumes or dark 
clothing, they stood out like beacons in denim jeans and white T-shirts. Lest 
there be any doubt they were first-timers, a self-appointed roving band of 
regulars inked their foreheads and cheeks with Vs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm freaked out. It's weird. All these people are dressed up weird," said 
Christine Wright, 18, of Covina, looking at the others in line. 
</P>
<P>
But her friend, Carmen Falcon, 19, of Victorville, reflected: "I think we feel 
weirder than they do!" 
</P>
<P>
Soon the more timid will be able to see "Rocky Horror" in the privacy of their 
own living rooms. A legitimate video copy of "Rocky Horror" (many devotees have 
bootleg copies) will finally be released on Nov. 8. To many fans, it's close to 
sacrilege because the movie has always been inseparable from the experience of 
seeing it in a theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Just watching the movie is nothing like the experience," cinema manager 
Peterson said. "It's the difference to listening to a play on tape and seeing a 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to this concern, the video has a short prologue filmed at different 
theaters across the country to educate video viewers of the "Rocky Horror" 
experience. And the Balboa gets a nod when, by chance, its marquee is featured 
both in the prologue and in a music video of the Time Warp dance at the end of 
the tape. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt when those watching the tape are ready to try the Time Warp, they'll 
find regulars at the theater waiting to "devirginize" them and welcome them to 
the world of "Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Balboa is going to go for a long time," publicist Deegan said. 
"They have terrific leaders and tremendous enthusiasm."

COSTNER TAKES A STAND; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S MADE A WESTERN. IT'S THREE HOURS LONG. IT HAS SUBTITLES. AND HE LIKES IT 
LIKE THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
IT IS NEARLY 100 DEGREES in the flats of Hollywood. Kevin Costner is sitting in 
his modest, un-air-conditioned office on the lot of Raleigh Studios, next to a 
table fan working overtime. Propping his rawhide-tipped, two-tone cowboy boots 
on the desk, white polo shirt setting off his steel-blue eyes and California 
tan, the 35-year-old actor leans back and gives his icy assessment of the movie 
industry. Record heat notwithstanding, he's the epitome of cool. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the hit business," he says, in that engaging, straight-on manner 
that evokes comparisons with another paragon of cool, Gary Cooper. "To me, a 
flop is a bad movie, not one that fails at the box office. There were five 
flops this summer that will make $80 million each." 
</P>
<P>
The topic of conversation is movie-making and risk-taking -- more specifically, 
Costner's biggest gamble yet: co-producing, directing and starring in "Dances 
With Wolves," an $18-million epic scheduled for release Friday. Mere mention of 
the word gamble, though, is enough to set Costner off. A testiness shows around 
his eyes. The confident tone veers toward cocky. As he sees it, he has simply 
made the movie he wants to make -- now, as always, playing the Hollywood game 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
Defying a business that's based on dues-paying, Costner has jumped from 
featured actor to auteur in near-record time. Five years of notable roles such 
as the rambunctious cowboy in "Silverado," an antiseptic Eliot Ness in "The 
Untouchables," a steamy double agent in "No Way Out," an over-the-hill, 
bush-league catcher in "Bull Durham" and the Iowa farmer in last year's 
sleeper, "Field of Dreams," dropped him on the brink of superstardom. But 
unlike such Hollywood eminences as Paul Newman and Robert Redford, he didn't 
stop to solidify his status before moving behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
And if he slowed down to listen to Hollywood's conventional wisdom, it's clear 
he didn't heed it. "Dances With Wolves," the story of a U.S. cavalry officer 
living among the Sioux Indians in the 1860s, ignores the industry's edict that 
Westerns are out. A full third of the dialogue is spoken in Lakota, the Sioux 
language, so audiences will have to wrestle with subtitles. And for good 
measure, this movie is long: The film logs in at a couple of minutes under 
three hours -- a full 50% longer than profit-oriented studios and theater 
owners deem ideal. 
</P>
<P>
By deferring his actor/director salary to the tune of several million dollars, 
Costner has put not only himself but his bankbook on the line. He's already met 
the skeptics head-on. When word leaked out last year that his film was over 
budget and behind schedule, the press dubbed the project "Kevin's Gate," a 
reference to "Heaven's Gate," the industry synonym for an epic flop. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wilson, a producer and director of low-budget features who created Tig 
Productions with Costner in 1989, knows what the insiders are saying. "These 
are Kevin's golden years. Hollywood is paying huge sums of money to leading 
men, of which there are not many. Kevin has taken 18 months of his life, made 
himself unavailable to do anything else, just to make this movie. It's a 
high-wire act in full view of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Costner is forced to agree -- at least in part. "It's a dumb first movie," he 
says with a grin. "Full of kids, animals, first-time actors speaking in a 
foreign language. A period piece on top of that. But I'm just offering up the 
film, letting the people decide. 
</P>
<P>
"My only concern is whether the movie is good. And I think it is," the actor 
continues, dead serious. "I have no control after that. My friends are afraid 
I'm going to be eaten up. They know I've put my heart in it, up there on the 
block for anyone to do with what they will. But I don't care what Hollywood 
thinks. You can underline that." 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT Costner is staking his reputation on a Western. Part 
Cherokee on his father's side, he has always been drawn to the image of a man 
on a horse, self-sufficient, all his worldly possessions in a bedroll. At 18, 
he built a canoe, and he and a friend traveled the country, boat strapped to 
the top of their car, driving and paddling some of the routes taken by Lewis 
and Clark. A high point of the trip was a stop at the site of Custer's Last 
Stand in southern Montana. Still, Costner wasn't on the lookout for a story 
about Native Americans. This one literally fell into his lap. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1986, and Michael Blake -- a screenwriter and friend of Costner -- was 
sitting on the actor's living-room floor complaining that the scripts he'd 
written were never picked up. "Write a novel," advised Costner, pointing to a 
stack of 20 scripts piled in the corner. "If you write a screenplay, it'll just 
end up there." 
</P>
<P>
Blake was penniless and had nothing to lose. So he spent the next eight months 
writing -- while Costner, Wilson and their friends fed him and gave him a place 
to stay. Each night Blake read aloud to his hosts, who became increasingly 
convinced that there was a great film in his story of Lt. John J. Dunbar and 
his adventures among the Sioux. Still, they made no promises. When Blake 
finished the book, he moved on to Arizona to take a job as a dishwasher. "Next 
thing I knew," he recalls, "there was a call from Kevin telling me to get 
started on a screenplay. He was involved every step of the way." Costner, Blake 
and Wilson sat down and worked through six drafts of the script for 2 1/2 
years, laboring over it line by line until it rang true to Costner's ear. 
</P>
<P>
They took the first draft of the screenplay to Nelson Entertainment, where it 
languished for half a year; then they approached Island Pictures, which kept it 
for another six months. In both cases, the companies were interested but 
couldn't come up with the budget. Finally, Costner and Wilson decided to raise 
the production money themselves. They peddled the foreign rights first and, 
with enough cash in hand to finance 40% of the film, went into pre-production. 
Two weeks before shooting began, they signed a deal with Orion Pictures. 
Costner came away with the money to finish the film and the right of final cut 
-- what appears on the screen will reflect the director's choices, not the 
studio's. 
</P>
<P>
Costner resists the notion that he's on unfamiliar turf. "I've worn two hats 
whether I've had the title or not," he asserts. "I'm always involved in the 
overview. Directing isn't a statement as much as a logical extension of what 
I've been doing all along. The film has always come first. I've never aspired 
to be the head flea on a dead dog." 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin has the ability to see himself in the third person," says Roger 
Donaldson, who directed him in the 1987 thriller "No Way Out." When the 
question of Costner's hairstyle in the film arose, the actor and the director 
spent a week trying to decide whether Costner should wear it short, befitting a 
Navy officer, or longer, to enhance his golden-boy good looks. "Vanity didn't 
enter into it," Donaldson says. "It was as though we were having a creative 
meeting about someone else." In the end, Costner opted for close-cropped 
realism. 
</P>
<P>
Costner sees himself as a storyteller; to him, the script has always been 
sacred. "I'm very careful about what gets altered," he says. "If you don't give 
the material a chance, you cheat yourself and the audience. No one slips 
changes under my door." 
</P>
<P>
In "Dances With Wolves," he lets his characters talk and allows the plot to 
unfold slowly, European-style. One scene lingers on two characters quietly 
talking as a mutual attraction takes hold. No quick cuts, no special effects, 
just two faces, a conversation and chemistry. "I'm a more-is-better type of 
director," he says. "If something is good, I don't want it to end. All the 
camera work in the world can't disguise the lack of story. We've become 
factories, giving up the idea that good stories are good for us. I try to keep 
things as intimate as possible instead of dazzling people with my camera work. 
Anyhow, technical skill is something I don't possess . . . so I'd get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Costner talks a lot about "getting caught." A perfectionist, he's obsessed with 
making things conform to his vision -- and seeing that those around him do, 
too. The point he emphasizes is that even in the illusion business, truth is at 
the center of every good story. Certainly, he acknowledges, movies are "the 
purest form of marketing. We're not talking about chairs or desks here but 
ideas pulled out of thin air that can make $100 million. If that's not Barnum 
&amp; Bailey, I don't know what is." But what Hollywood hasn't realized yet, he 
says, "is that truth is as marketable as lies." 
</P>
<P>
And truth for Costner is in the details. "I promised myself that I'd never 
shoot a gun more than six times because a gun only holds six bullets," he 
explains. "And I don't like girls running in high heels -- I'd rather have them 
kick them off." In "Dances With Wolves," Costner carries realism to a level 
that scares the accountants. You won't find a single Jeff Chandler swathed in 
rust-colored greasepaint: Native Americans are cast as themselves -- and speak 
in their own tongue. "We explored doing it another way, but it just didn't 
jell," says the director. "We're dealing with a love between two people -- a 
U.S. cavalryman and a white woman raised by Indians -- who are unable to 
communicate. If they both speak English, it's a fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Costner, say his colleagues, likes shooting the breeze and thrives on debate. 
He's no intellectual, he'll tell you, but both on and off camera he has ideas 
about things that he's not shy about sharing -- about law ("a convenience for 
people but also used to destroy"), about movies ("Just because they're called 
talking pictures doesn't mean you have to be afraid of silences"). 
</P>
<P>
But ask him to talk about the plot of "Dances With Wolves" or to provide 
insight into the character he plays, and the actor suddenly comes up dry. You 
play a cavalryman, he's prompted after a substantial pause. "Who goes west on 
his own," the actor adds haltingly. Period. End quote. "I've never been gifted 
with the ability to do a poster," he explains, with a reference to "Field of 
Dreams." "I'm not a 'Ray Kinsella is searching for his dreams, and one day his 
dreams come searching for him.' I don't think in shorthand." 
</P>
<P>
He'd obviously prefer to let the movie speak for itself. Smiling suddenly, he 
gets up to pull out a videocassette, a teaser for the film. "Want to see some 
of it?" he asks rhetorically. "Just watch," he warns as I pick up a pen and 
prepare to take notes. "One man, two worlds," a voice blares over lyrical 
travelogue footage of South Dakota and Costner riding, as he puts it, "like the 
wind surrounded by thousands of buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he offers to screen the second reel of the film. From that and 
conversations with his less-tight-lipped colleagues, a bare-bones synopsis 
emerges. Costner plays Lt. John Dunbar, who is decorated after a skirmish in 
the Civil War. Offered any assignment he wishes, he heads west to see the 
frontier. There, among the Indians, he encounters a medicine man who, 
foreseeing white expansionism, counsels communication and cooperation; a 
warrior who resists any attempt at conciliation, and a white woman brought up 
by Indians after her parents were killed by another tribe. She serves not only 
as a bridge between the two cultures but emerges as Costner's love interest as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Costner didn't consider "Bull Durham" a baseball movie, and he hesitates to 
call this one a Western. "I've said it's about how the West was lost," he 
admits. "But I'm not trying to set the record straight. Like all of my movies, 
it's about behavior. About a people ill-equipped to deal with what was coming. 
About the bigoted mentality of the soldiers in the West. We've had a lot of 
films portraying Indians as the enemy, a few showing that they were cheated. 
This film explores how they felt being cheated. It's a very intimate approach 
to a very big subject." 
</P>
<P>
Shot in the outback of South Dakota in 106 days (a month over schedule), the 
film is epic in scope. The cast of 500 includes 48 speaking roles and parts for 
150 Civil War soldiers and 175 Sioux. The Native Americans were recruited 
through ads in the Lakota Times and auditions held throughout the United States 
and Canada. He found a few of his actors closer to home. "That's my dad," 
Costner says with evident pleasure as the face of silver-haired Bill Costner 
flashes on the screen. "Cindy (Kevin's wife) and my three kids are also 
featured extras. All of them are wiped out -- so they won't be in the sequel, 
that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Though there was no doubt who was boss, collaboration between director and cast 
was encouraged. "Kevin knows what an actor can bring," says Mary McDonnell, the 
female lead. "Instead of protecting his ego, he'll adopt other ideas if he's 
convinced they're better than his." 
</P>
<P>
Costner built in a three-week rehearsal period, as he'd seen Lawrence Kasdan do 
with "The Big Chill," expecting his actors to use the time to learn their 
Lakota dialogue and enough archery to shoot a bow and arrow while on a horse. 
Then there was the matter of professionalism among a largely inexperienced 
cast. When the Native American cast members showed up without knowing their 
lines, says Costner, "I reminded them that this was a project about their 
people, that if it didn't turn out, they'd be embarrassed, not me. I warned 
them that if they were cavalier with my time, there had better be good reason." 
He stops mid-thought. "I guess I can be tough." 
</P>
<P>
"The crew took the lead from him," Wilson recalls. "If he was willing to get up 
at 5, turn in at midnight and go out in his shirt sleeves in subzero weather, 
you follow the idiot." Blake agrees: "Kevin gives the impression he's just a 
regular guy, which puts people at their ease -- but he's an adventurer, curious 
to see how far he can go. 'Dances' pushed him to his outer limits." 
</P>
<P>
Physically, as well as mentally, it seems. Costner was on horseback, directing 
a buffalo-hunt scene, when an Indian rider lost control of his horse and 
crashed into him. The impact knocked Costner out of the saddle and twisted him 
around backward midair. "He hit the ground as hard as you can hit it, bounced 
two or three feet in the air and rolled over like a sack of grain," Blake says 
with a shudder. "If a buffalo had been behind him, he would have been killed. 
If the horse rolled over him -- which it nearly did -- he would have been 
seriously hurt. Everyone held their breath as Kevin sat up, brushed himself 
off, got on another horse and continued. He never said a word." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, says Costner, Day 1 was his most profound test. "Everyone told me to 
make sure I knew where to put the camera so the crew would feel I was in 
charge," he says with a smile. "I'd set up the first two shots weeks in 
advance, but two minutes into things, I knew that the geography was working 
against me, that my calculations were wrong. Instead of locking in, I proceeded 
to move the camera to another spot. That was the moment I knew I could do it, 
that I wouldn't be constrained by any insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
COSTNER'S FRIENDS describe him as "street smart," an outgrowth, no doubt, of 
his early years. Because his father, an executive with Pacific Bell, was 
frequently transferred, Kevin attended four different high schools around the 
state and felt perpetually on the periphery. "The fact that I was 5-2 as a 
sophomore didn't help," he says. "I'm 6-1 now but still relate to those 
feelings. I didn't date in high school and didn't get my growth until college. 
I never got over being short." 
</P>
<P>
Always what he terms "performance-oriented," Costner sang in an all-boys choir. 
"That's when I first realized I could manipulate audiences," he says. "Music 
has always made me very happy. You get an immediate response from people." 
Sports, too, were an ego boost for Costner, who earned varsity letters in 
baseball and basketball. "I did feel special as a kid," he says. "Not better, 
but special. . . . And there's no crime in that." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Villa Park High School in Orange County, Costner enrolled 
at Cal State Fullerton, arbitrarily choosing marketing as his major. Pledging 
Delta Chi, he met Cindy Silva at a fraternity party. She was the first woman, 
he says, that he "really dated." The two of them became inseparable and were 
married 2 1/2 years later, while they were still in college. 
</P>
<P>
Costner didn't consider acting until his senior year. Fighting sleep in an 
accounting class, he picked up a copy of the college newspaper, saw a 
casting-call notice and decided to try out for "Rumpelstiltskin." "I had grown 
a bit, so I knew I couldn't play the dwarf," he deadpans. "But I knew there had 
to be a prince. I lost the audition because I had no tools. Good looks didn't 
help me at all, which is why I never counted on them. I knew right then, 
though, that I wanted to be an actor more than anything, to be behind that 
door. There seemed to be something magical there." 
</P>
<P>
He headed for the South Coast Actors Coop once, then twice, then five times a 
week. In his first serious effort -- Arthur Laurents' "Invitation to a March" 
at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse -- "I was horrible," he says. "But in acting, 
you reserve the right to improve -- and I've always gotten fueled by my 
disasters." 
</P>
<P>
Costner took a job in a family construction business -- a position he disliked 
immediately and abandoned after 30 days. While Cindy stayed in Orange County to 
finish school, he headed for Hollywood, attending a film-budgeting class at 
UCLA and sleeping in the back of a truck in a parking lot at Sunset and La 
Brea. Cindy soon followed -- albeit with trepidation. "The vows say 'for better 
and for worse, richer or poorer,' " he says. "She probably thought it was 
'worse' and 'poorer' from the outset." 
</P>
<P>
Costner became a stage manager at Raleigh Studios, an independent, all-purpose 
production facility that makes commercials, features and videos, where he 
coordinated the equipment for each production. Answering ads in Drama-Logue, he 
lined up bit parts in two low-budget, lower-caliber films. The experience was a 
turning point, of sorts. "They started with the lowest common denominator -- 
and settled for less than that," he says. "There was a noticeable lack of 
invention. From that point on, I resolved to hold out for only the best. It's 
easy to have convictions when you're powerful, much less so when you're a 
nobody, which is when it counts." 
</P>
<P>
Costner started saying no early on. Hired to pose as a young Luther Adler for a 
photograph to be used in the 1982 film "Frances," he was ultimately offered a 
small walk-on role. His one line -- "Good night, Frances," delivered to Jessica 
Lange -- would have earned him a Screen Actors Guild card, a prerequisite for 
union auditions that had eluded him for six years. When it came to delivering 
the line, however, Costner balked. "Frances had all these autograph hounds 
around her, and I didn't want to interrupt. I didn't know how to make the line 
work. It drove everyone crazy. 'Just say it,' they yelled -- and finally I did. 
But so quietly that the sound guy shook his head." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Costner passed on a chance to read for the Tom Berenger role in 
"Platoon" for fear of offending his brother, a decorated Vietnam War vet. He 
also turned down the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in "Fat Man and Little Boy" 
because he doubted that anyone would believe he had an I.Q. of 160. "Like Steve 
McQueen, with whom we both share an infatuation," says director Kasdan, "Kevin 
has always had a clear sense of his abilities and what was right for him." 
</P>
<P>
It was Kasdan who gave Costner his first big break, casting him as the suicide 
victim who sets the plot in motion in 1983's "The Big Chill." Though only a 
shot of Costner's forehead and hairline survived, Kasdan made up for it by 
casting him as Jake in "Silverado" -- which brought him to the attention of the 
general public and caught the eye of a number of critics. It was a role, says 
his former agent, J. J. Harris, that reflected "a lot of the real Kevin, the 
uninhibited, wild side that he doesn't get to express in real life because he 
has to be responsible." That his subsequent movies -- "No Way Out," "Bull 
Durham" and "Field of Dreams" -- made him a star, Costner says, matters less 
than that he likes them. He acknowledges that he has more misses than hits and 
characterizes his career as "flawed." "What's most important is that you convey 
the sense it's the first time you're ever doing a role," he says. "Most of the 
time I fall short." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "The Untouchables," some critics agreed, which came as no 
surprise to Costner. "Eliot Ness was the toughest role I ever played," he says. 
"I had to be a hero without the usual quotient of charisma and power." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the physical, however, Costner knows he's a natural. "I'm a 
run-and-jump actor," he says. "I like to swing from things, to go get the bad 
guys and have them chase me." Donaldson was impressed by Costner's athleticism 
in "No Way Out": In a scene in which he was being chased by some CIA types, it 
was actually Costner smashing into the windshield head-on. "He hit harder than 
expected, and I was pleased," says Donaldson. "But the producers whispered a 
few comments in my ear" about wanting their actor to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Stunts are one thing, sex quite another. When discussing the film's red-hot 
limo scene, in which he's seduced by Sean Young, Costner displays the 
vulnerability critics say makes him play "masculine" instead of "macho." It's a 
quality that, as the cliche goes, makes men like him and women love him. "I 
feel comfortable on a horse or on the windshield of a car -- but not in the 
back seat," he admits. "I guess I'm modest. I didn't even feel comfortable 
taking my shirt off in that bedroom scene. It's difficult for me to compete 
with someone who spends years in the gym. I'm no slouch, but I don't have the 
figure you see in commercials." 
</P>
<P>
A love scene with McDonnell in "Dances With Wolves" proved equally traumatic. 
"I had to set up the shot, take off my clothes and walk out there, relying on 
other people to tell me if you could see too much," Costner recalls. "Then I 
had to watch it all in the dailies." His co-star remembers it well. "Kevin was 
so sweet," she says. "He came up to me after the shot and said: 'The woman 
always starts out nervous, then she's fine. I don't think about it -- and by 
the third take, I'm a wreck.' Part of Kevin's confidence is his ability to be 
open. I love that he can admit things like that -- even when he's directing." 
</P>
<P>
COSTNER has struggled to stay normal in what is essentially an abnormal 
business -- to keep his personal life separate from the hype. He makes his home 
with Cindy and their children, Annie, 6, Lily, 3, and Joe, 2, near Pasadena, 
instead of in hallowed Beverly Hills or Malibu; heads for local movie theaters 
every weekend instead of private screening rooms, and, in the trendiest of 
towns and glitziest of industries, cultivates a look that is far more L. L. 
Bean than G Q. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Costner admits, "something has seeped away with success" -- the obvious 
things: a certain spontaneity, privacy, time for himself. Though he is 
reluctant to complain about his "high-class set of problems," he allows that 
directing has turned up the heat. "A movie is a glacier moving along inches at 
a time. It's a 24-hour-a-day gig," he says. Yes, he acknowledges, the job takes 
its toll on his family, but he seems increasingly comfortable with the choices 
he's made. "Cindy is smart and knows that I had to grow up and do something 
with my life and that this life opens doors for her, too," he says. "I have a 
genuine love of getting my hands dirty with film. Still, the baggage that comes 
with it no one could have counted on." 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves" must weigh heavily on Costner. In unguarded moments he'll 
joke about his worst-case scenario: The critics will pan it, and no one will 
come. At the mention of "Kevin's Gate," he defensively calls this movie a 
bargain, even at $2 million over budget. "I got a lot on the screen for that, 
far more than a studio could have," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I set myself up for such scrutiny," he says softly. "In the 
privacy of my room, I'll wonder if I've bitten off too much and whether I'll 
make it. There's a nauseousness that goes along with it. I have to answer for 
all this." 
</P>
<P>
Would he direct again? "Sure, if something interested me," he shoots back. 
"Directing is about passion . . . not about the next available moment." He's 
already traded in his spurs for tights, playing Robin Hood in "Prince of 
Thieves," a $30-million venture directed by Kevin Reynolds in England. (The 
actor is reportedly getting close to an $8-million advance against a percentage 
of the film's gross revenues.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orion has sent out posters to movie theaters, heralding the release 
of "Dances With Wolves." One features a surreal nighttime shot of four 
stampeding buffalo and the high-concept tag line Costner can't -- or won't -- 
attempt for himself: "Inside everyone is a frontier waiting to be discovered." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly appropriate, in this case.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Iraqi troops marched into Kuwait on Aug. 2 and threw the world's oil 
markets into disarray, Philipp Holzmann AG, Germany's largest construction 
company, did not bat an eye. 
</P>
<P>
In the next month, Holzmann won contracts for a $57-million office building in 
Munich, a $40-million housing complex elsewhere in Bavaria and a $30-million 
apartment building in Dusseldorf. Marching into the new market in what was then 
East Germany, it also signed up for a $48-million hotel in Weimar. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has stopped," said Claus Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the company. "Our 
clients haven't cut back, and neither have we." 
</P>
<P>
Holzmann's go-for-it posture belies mounting fears among economists and 
business executives that the world is on the edge of a deep recession, one that 
could savage the economies of the biggest industrial nations and their smaller 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the latest oil crisis has taken nothing like the economic toll of its 
two predecessors in the early and late 1970s. The risks to the world economy 
have increased, but the betting now is that tomorrow won't bring global 
economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide growth is certain to weaken. There will be mass layoffs. Some nations 
may suffer greatly. But the most common assessment is that a substantial 
segment of the industrial world will remain remarkably buoyant and reasonably 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck is not the only reason. In the last decade, the industrial countries 
have insulated themselves from oil shocks by curbing their appetite for oil. 
And their policy-makers have learned how better to cope with outside shocks to 
their economies. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the world is paying an economic toll for the latest oil crisis. 
The United Nations has imposed a worldwide boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, 
and oil prices have shot up. 
</P>
<P>
Some nations, notably the English-speaking ones, seem to be on the slippery 
slope to recession. Canada and Australia, whose economies shrank in the three 
months from April to June, seem almost sure to meet the traditional definition 
of recession -- two consecutive quarters of declining economic production. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, whose economies were also foundering even before 
Aug. 2, are probably not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
The investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers projects that the U.S. economy 
will produce less next year than this year. The Confederation of British 
Industry finds business pessimism at a 10-year high. 
</P>
<P>
But many economists believe that Japan, Germany and much of the rest of 
industrial Europe will take little more than a glancing blow from the current 
crisis -- unless, that is, the crisis grows much worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to whether there will be a worldwide recession is how high oil prices 
go and how long they stay there," said Ron Napier, a London-based economist 
with Salomon Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
However, a substantial school of economic thought holds that the seeds of a 
worldwide recession had already been sown well before Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
According to this camp, the all-but-inevitable U.S. recession will reverberate 
around the world by cutting into export sales in countries from Brazil to 
Japan. And the crash in Tokyo's stock market, which lost nearly half its value 
this year before turning back up last month, will deplete Japan's ability to 
finance investment in other countries around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist with Washington's Brookings Institution, said 
the world's economies have become far more dependent on each other in the last 
decade. Viruses in the United States and Japan, he said, can quickly spread to 
all corners of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
A. Gary Shilling, head of his own economic-consulting firm in New York, 
predicts nothing less than a full-scale depression. "Our view," he said, "is 
that it's going to be global and deep." 
</P>
<P>
Already, business activity is noticeably slowing in industries that depend 
heavily on oil. Air Canada recently announced that it was laying off 2,900 
employees, or 12.5% of its work force. Five American airlines -- Pan Am, 
Midway, USAir, TWA and American -- have announced layoffs, and others are 
likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
In the transportation sector, the wreckage is not confined to economies that 
appear headed for recession. Despite the generally prosperous Dutch economy, 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has announced a 15% reduction in staff and overhead 
costs over the next three years and the loss of 500 support-staff jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Car companies are also feeling the heat. In a generally bullish Germany, most 
car makers are trimming their sails, according to Ernst Moritz Lipp, chief 
economist for Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. And in France, Renault is planning 
for a 3% decline in sales next year -- not as bad as the 15% after the first 
oil shock or the 5% after the second, but bad news nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, at least at present, is a relative island of tranquility. Toyota, for 
example, is sticking with plans to invest a whopping $4.5 billion during the 12 
months that began July 1 and to open one new auto assembly plant and two new 
parts plants in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Economic growth generally continues strong in Japan, which owes its boom of the 
last five years not to increased sales to the United States but to a surge in 
demand by Japanese consumers. The Japan Department Stores Assn. reports that 
sales growth over the same month the previous year dipped in August to 8.8% -- 
still vigorous, but down from the 14.2% registered in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen any decline of people's personal consumption since the gulf 
crisis," said Kazuo Iwai, a spokesman for Takashimaya Department Stores. Not 
only have purchases of daily necessities held up, he said, but "sales of 
paintings and precious metals have been very good for the last several months." 
</P>
<P>
And outside such oil-dependent sectors as transportation and petrochemicals, 
the outlook remains generally bright in continental Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Germany, which enjoys a happy combination of robust growth and inflation of 
less than 3%, is at the head of the class. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest, 
said consumer demand, up nearly 5% in the last year, is fueling economic growth 
there just as it is in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The investment firm of Goldman Sachs expects moderate to healthy growth next 
year in all the major Western European economies: 2.8% in Germany, 2.5% in 
Italy and 1.8% in France. 
</P>
<P>
For the world as a whole, Morgan Stanley, another investment firm, foresees 
economic growth of 2% next year, down a full percentage point from this year 
but far short of a global recession. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the world can keep its head above water will depend on a host of 
unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is the depth and duration of the current oil shock, which is now in 
only its fourth month and has so far led to only about a doubling in oil 
prices. The two earlier shocks lasted far longer, with the first ending in a 
fourfold increase in oil prices and the second in nearly a tripling. 
</P>
<P>
That is far from the only imponderable. What effect will the decimated Soviet 
economy have on the rest of the world? Will the former West Germany prove rich 
enough to solve the economic problems of the East now that they are unified? 
What about the recession in Eastern Europe as the formerly Communist economies 
test the waters of the free market? Closer to home, will continuing problems 
with the U.S. budget deficit finally come home to roost? 
</P>
<P>
In that environment of uncertainty, analysts divide generally into two camps: 
the cautious optimists and the irrepressible doom-sayers. 
</P>
<P>
The optimists expect the Persian Gulf crisis to end before Jan. 1, whether 
through diplomacy or violence. They expect the massive Saudi Arabian oil 
fields, so vital to the industrial economies, to escape unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of foreign crude oil to U.S. refiners, which has more than 
doubled from less than $15 a barrel to about $34 since the crisis began, will 
gradually retreat, according to this scenario. Prices in 1991 will average 
somewhere in the $25 to $30 range. 
</P>
<P>
Dresdner Bank's Lipp, among many others, finds this scenario compelling. Unlike 
the first two oil shocks, he said, the world is not facing a major crude oil 
shortage because Saudi Arabia and other major producers are nearly making up 
for the 4.3 million barrels a day that have been lost from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have soared, he said, largely because consumers are stocking up. In 
Germany, for example, homeowners began laying in their heating oil in September 
instead of waiting as usual until November. 
</P>
<P>
And even if oil prices head up to $40 a barrel and remain there through 1991, 
the global economy might well escape disaster. Brian V. Mullaney, a 
London-based economist for Morgan Stanley, said he expects the vigorous 
economies of continental Western Europe to grow by an average of 2.5% next year 
if oil prices fall back and to still manage growth of about 1.5% even if oil 
sells for $40. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil price shock of 1990, unlike its predecessors of the 1970s, is not 
likely to be the straw that broke the back of global expansion," Mullaney and 
New York colleague Robert S. Gay recently wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Since the last oil shock in 1979-1981, the world's major economic powers have 
insulated themselves to a considerable degree from the effects of rising oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the 24 leading industrial nations consumed slightly less oil last 
year than in 1973, even though the sum of their economies had grown by about 
75%. 
</P>
<P>
Savings seem even more impressive when measured in dollars rather than barrels 
of oil. As a percentage of national economic output, oil consumption in each of 
the seven biggest industrial nations plunged by an astonishing two-thirds to 
three-quarters, according to Morgan Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
Even the United States, the biggest oil consumer of the group, spent only 2.3% 
of its gross national product on oil last year, down from 8.1% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The declining price of oil -- it fell by about 50% during the 1980s -- accounts 
for about half of the improvement. The other half results from more lasting 
factors, including energy conservation, a deliberate switch from oil to other 
fuels and a trend away from energy-intensive manufacturing industries to 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Structural adjustment over the last 10 years has given us earthquake 
protection that will more easily absorb the impact of a doubling of oil 
prices," said Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the Paris-based 
Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the two oil shocks in the 1970s, the latest crisis has hit at a 
less vulnerable part of the industrial world's economic cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Before the oil shocks of the 1970s, Dresdner Bank economist Lipp said, 
inflation was already rampant in many of the industrial countries. The soaring 
price of oil made inflation intolerable. Central banks responded by clamping 
down hard on national money supplies, and recession inevitably followed. 
</P>
<P>
This time, by contrast, economic growth was solid in most industrial countries 
immediately before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but prices were not getting 
out of hand. So the risk of exaggerated inflation is much less, and so is the 
likelihood of a downturn that generally accompanies the battle against runaway 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Economic policy-makers have learned how to cope with outside shocks such as 
suddenly soaring oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
During the first oil shock, in 1973-1974, some countries, notably Japan and 
Britain, tried to keep interest rates low to prevent recessions, Morgan 
Stanley's Mullaney said. Instead, prices soared, and subsequent efforts to 
retaliate by raising interest rates merely deepened the inevitable recession 
that followed. 
</P>
<P>
During the second oil shock, which began in 1979 during a period of 
particularly high inflation in the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve and 
other central banks raised interest rates promptly. Once again, global 
recession resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"Central banks are not inclined to repeat the mistake of the 1970s," Mullaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lipp pointed to the worldwide stock market crash of October, 1987, as evidence 
that policy-makers have learned that a steady-as-she-goes approach to external 
shocks works best. After the crash, central banks initially poured money into 
their national economies to ensure against an abrupt slowing of economic 
activity. But they tightened up again quickly enough to prevent runaway 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, in its recent report on the world economy, 
suggested that policy-makers have also learned not to try to shelter consumers 
from huge oil price hikes. With the example of the United States in mind, the 
IMF said direct government subsidies for oil consumers result in little more 
than bigger budget deficits. And oil price controls merely distort markets and 
dampen incentives for oil companies to produce and for consumers to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts find the grounds for optimism less than compelling. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they are not prepared to assume that the Persian Gulf crisis 
will end quickly and without major damage to Middle East oil fields. But even 
if it does, the doom-sayers find plenty of reasons for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, of the Brookings Institution, said that the optimists have 
underestimated the domino effect of such ominous events as the likely U.S. 
recession and the recent plunge in the Tokyo stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recession, he said, will wreak havoc in the heavily indebted Latin 
American countries that rely heavily on the United States as an export market. 
Jeffrey Schott, a research fellow at Washington's Institute for International 
Economics, said Brazil will take the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
"And Brazil's economy was already at the precipice," Schott said. The 
government managed to rein in inflation from 80% a month to about 10%. But the 
cost was brutal -- the economy has contracted by about 10% in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mexico, a major oil producer, will not benefit as much as it might from 
rising oil prices because it has done little in the last decade to develop new 
oil fields. Production is up less than 10% since Aug. 2, and government 
officials concede privately that even that rate cannot be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mexico will be hit particularly hard by a recession in the United 
States because two-thirds of its exports go to its neighbor to the north. 
</P>
<P>
There are danger signals from the other side of the globe as well. Tokyo's 
stock market plunge, which at its worst slashed asset holdings by a staggering 
$2 trillion, has already cut into Japan's ability to continue financing 
economic expansion around the world and the budget deficit in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that overseas purchases of stocks 
and bonds by institutional Japanese investors plummeted to $20 billion during 
the April-to-September period this year, contrasted with $51 billion during the 
same six months a year ago. If sustained, that trend could seriously impede 
world economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling points to a host of additional perils -- the persistent U.S. trade and 
budget deficits, the savings and loan disaster in the United States, the 
staggering debt burdens of many Third World countries and what he regards as 
massively overvalued real estate and other assets in Japan. All of these, he 
said, leave the world economy off balance and vulnerable to outside shocks. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shilling finds one peculiar feature of the latest oil crisis that 
bodes ill for the world economy. In the two earlier shocks, he said, the 
oil-producing nations invested their "petrodollars" in oil-consuming countries, 
whose own investment dollars had been siphoned off by soaring oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
This time, by contrast, Saudi Arabia, which is reaping the lion's share of the 
windfall from rising oil prices, is using much of it to defray the cost of the 
U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. However noble that effort may be in 
geopolitical terms, Shilling said, it is not as economically useful as 
financing industrial expansion in the oil-consuming countries. 
</P>
<P>
Paye, the head of OECD, told the European Parliament recently that the economic 
outlook for the 24 industrial countries in his organization had turned from 
satisfactory to uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"The world," he said, "appears to be poised on the brink of the unknown."

GOVERNOR'S RACE CLOSE AT THE WIRE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE FEINSTEIN-WILSON BATTLE SETS A SPENDING RECORD. ON THE LAST 
WEEKEND BEFORE VOTERS MAKE UP THEIR MINDS, MANY CONTESTS STRUGGLE FOR 
ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 race for governor enters the record books Tuesday as the most 
expensive contest for chief executive in the history of the state, potentially 
cashing out at nearly double the cost of the previous record in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
And it will be up to voters to decide whether history of another sort is made 
with the election of Democrat Dianne Feinstein as the first woman governor of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
To command victory, Feinstein -- one of five women vying for state 
constitutional offices -- will have to set back Republican Pete Wilson, the 
incumbent U.S. senator and former mayor trying for a political hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
As candidates made their last-ditch efforts to impress voters, both Feinstein 
and Wilson appeared to be within striking distance of success. Other statewide 
races were close, too, particularly the bitterly fought contest for attorney 
general and the expensive duel for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Through the weekend, campaigns were sending slate mailers, candidates were 
pushing for precious seconds before overdosed television viewers and money was 
flying fast and furiously. 
</P>
<P>
Between Jan. 1 and Oct. 20 -- before the final two weeks of television time had 
been bought -- Feinstein and Wilson together had spent $30.5 million in pursuit 
of the governorship. That figure does not count millions more, including nearly 
$4 million by Wilson alone, that was spent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Together with the $5 million spent by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp in the 
Democratic primary, the major candidates thus had spent more than $35 million 
in 1990 before the final pre-election crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Until this contest, the most expensive race for California governor was in 
1982, when George Deukmejian and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley fought in a race 
that cost $25.4 million, including spending by minor candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"If the country is entering a recession, you would never know it by the amounts 
of money that are being spent," said Herbert Alexander, a USC political science 
professor who studies political financing. 
</P>
<P>
The current race apparently is the most expensive gubernatorial election in the 
nation in the last few decades, surpassing the $33.5 million spent in 1986 in 
Texas. The only races that might have exceeded that total, when inflation is 
counted in, were the New York governor's contests in which Nelson Rockefeller 
spent millions of dollars, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
All through a long and contentious summer and fall, the Wilson-Feinstein battle 
has shaped up as the closest duel since the last change of power in the 
governor's office in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
That year, too, the Democratic candidate was aiming at history. But Bradley 
failed in his attempt to become the first elected black governor of the state. 
</P>
<P>
During much of this general election campaign, Feinstein, the 57-year-old 
former mayor of San Francisco, played down the historic nature of her 
candidacy. But as Election Day approached, she authored pointed reminders. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you ready to elect the first woman governor in the state?" Feinstein asked 
cheering senior citizens last week at Laguna Hills' Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's fond hope was that her gender would personify "change," that 
illusive image that both she and Wilson tried to corral. But Wilson also 
pressed a case that he represented change, if not by gender at least by design. 
</P>
<P>
He alternated not-too-subtle suggestions that he would be a different sort of 
Republican than conservative George Deukmejian with outright assertions that 
Feinstein would be one of the incumbent capitol crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is desperately needed," said Wilson, who also is 57. "But you can't 
bring it if you're wedded to the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made heavy use of the status quo in his campaign, benefiting financially 
from repeated campaign visits by President Bush, former President Ronald Reagan 
and Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Both Feinstein and Wilson have presented themselves as more activist than 
Deukmejian, more willing to balance the needs of the state's unfortunates with 
the fiscal imperatives of cost-cutting. She describes herself as "tough and 
caring," while he calls himself the "compassionate conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, however, has addressed in depth how they would handle a more than 
billion-dollar deficit expected in the next state budget. Feinstein has vowed 
to call a budget summit of interested parties the day after the election, and 
said she would raise taxes on wealthy Californians if need be. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson opposes any increase in income taxes and demands wholesale budget 
reform. That means all items would be on the table, including education funding 
now guaranteed by 1988's Proposition 98. Feinstein calls the proposition, which 
gives education at least 41% of the state's general fund revenues each year, 
"inviolate." 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to reality, neither has taken a "no new taxes" vow. While that breaks 
with the past, the other issues in the race have come from the traditional 
campaign playbook. 
</P>
<P>
The most consistent issue has been crime, and throughout the long campaign the 
candidates have battled back and forth to see which can claim to be toughest. 
Both support the death penalty and both have proposed stiffer sentences for 
drug users and traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein worked the Los Angeles Police Department's slogan -- "to protect and 
to serve" -- into almost all of her campaign speeches, and has proposed a 
return to the indeterminate sentencing system for violent criminals, a move 
that she said would keep dangerous convicts in prison indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
She also has been plugging Prop. 133, the ballot initiative sponsored by her 
running mate, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, that would pump $7.5 billion into 
anti-drug programs over four years by raising the state sales tax a half-cent. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson at first said he might vote for the measure, but has since come out 
against it. Like Feinstein, he has called for tougher sentencing laws and said 
California should no longer give inmates time off for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Although he denied he was using it to appeal to women, Wilson emphasized the 
crime of rape throughout the campaign, to the exclusion of other crimes such as 
murder and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond crime and taxes, the campaign also saw a resurgence of candidate 
interest in other basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein rarely appeared in public without fanning support for her "early 
childhood education" program, which would offer schooling to 4-year-olds by 
shifting some of the receipts of the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson talked regularly of a California with "much longer graduation lines and 
much shorter unemployment lines," although his plans for improving education 
rest largely on voluntary efforts by private citizens. He also touted a 
prenatal care plan that would help provide aid to women not covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Voter initiatives did their part to commandeer the governor's race. In key 
areas, the candidates adopted differing positions on initiatives, which then 
came to eclipse their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
The furor over term limits is the most recent chasm to divide the candidates. 
Wilson announced his support for Proposition 140, which would limit state 
senators and constitutional officers to eight years of service and assembly 
members to six years. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein castigated the initiative, saying its success would leave a neophyte 
Legislature to fend off the assaults of veteran lobbyists and bureaucrats. But 
Wilson contended that it was certainly a way to shake up the Sacramento 
Establishment. The fact that Wilson himself is a career politician did not seem 
to rattle voters. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposition, the sweeping environmental initiative known to its 
proponents as "Big Green," split the candidates from the primary onward. 
Throughout the campaign, Feinstein, whose loyalties were at first suspect among 
environmentalists, tried to use the initiative to batter a senator who prided 
himself on environmental moderation. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates also approached California's burgeoning growth as an 
environmental issue. Feinstein proposed a state growth management commission 
and a series of regional commissions that would regulate growth. She suggested 
that future growth in California could be channeled to less populated areas, 
lured by an enhanced "rail spine" down the center of the state and by tax 
incentives for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson blasted Feinstein's plan as unworkable and unwise. Instead, he said, the 
governor's Office of Planning and Research should help plan a concerted attack 
on unbridled growth -- but decisions should rest with the localities. Wilson, 
too, pointed with pride to his role in crafting a growth management plan for 
the swelling city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Some traditionally important issues merited little note during this campaign 
cycle, at least at the governor's level, because the candidates were in sync. 
Both opposed offshore oil drilling, and that issue was rarely discussed. Both 
supported the death penalty and both said they were advocates of abortion 
rights -- and disputes over who was the stronger advocate of each measure 
seemed not to sway many voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, both candidates were speaking of a California whose golden allure 
has been tarnished. However sublimely the message was sent, its focus was clear 
-- that the state is no longer the cutting-edge, visionary place it likes to 
think it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time we turned California around and made it what it can be," Wilson said 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
If the candidates for governor were often miffed that their message was lost 
amid national concerns over Mideast tensions and the faltering U.S. economy, 
their complaints were meager compared to those of other statewide candidates. 
For them, campaign 1990 was an exercise in scratching for money and begging for 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
That was true even in the bitterest of the races -- for state attorney general 
-- where Democrat Arlo Smith and Republican Dan Lungren hold diametrically 
different views on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the 11-year San Francisco district attorney, favors abortion rights and 
said he would go so far as to refuse to defend in court any abortion-limiting 
bills approved by the Legislature. Lungren, a former five-term congressman, 
staunchly opposed abortion and in 1987 co-sponsored a proposed federal 
constitutional amendment which would have outlawed all abortions except when 
the mother's life was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also said he would fight offshore oil drilling in court, while Lungren 
said he would support oil drilling on a case-by-case basis. Each vowed to be 
tough on crime, but argued the other's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
The race for lieutenant governor also hinged largely on crime, with incumbent 
Democrat McCarthy making his bid for a third term while touting Proposition 
133, the drug-war initiative that he sponsored. McCarthy also tried to separate 
himself from his Republican opponent, state Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport 
Beach, by stressing his support of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
But Bergeson, an abortion opponent, countered by jabbing McCarthy for his past 
support of abortion restrictions and emphasizing her conservative positions on 
crime. Behind in fund raising and in the polls, however, Bergeson was hoping 
for big coattails from Pete Wilson to help her into office. 
</P>
<P>
The race for treasurer featured a little-known Republican incumbent and a 
well-known Democrat with the liabilities and assets of a family political 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Brown, the daughter and sister of former governors, skated through the 
Democratic primary, while incumbent Thomas W. Hayes fought off a spirited 
challenge by GOP activist Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan. His campaign treasury was 
left dry, giving Brown the decided edge in late campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
The contentious race turned up a surprisingly deep list of differences between 
Brown and Hayes. Brown wanted to speed up the sale of bonds, while Hayes urged 
caution. Brown promised to press for social responsibility in corporations in 
which the state invests; Hayes said government has no place in corporate 
boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
While that contest was neck-and-neck in the polls, the race for state 
controller threatened to be an easy ride for Democratic incumbent Gray Davis, 
challenged by Republican Matthew Fong, a first-time office seeker and son of 
four-term Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
While mother and son represented different parties and were officially neutral 
in each other's races, attorney Fong took advantage of his lineage. One Fong 
television spot showed what appears to be a family portrait, over which an 
announcer intoned: "A tradition of honesty, competence and commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Davis seized on such issues as protecting the environment and 
abortion rights to depict himself as an activist controller not satisfied with 
merely tending ledgers. A former assemblyman and chief of staff to Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr., the 47-year-old Davis is also a champion campaign fund-raiser and 
easily outdistanced Fong in money raised. 
</P>
<P>
Fong's mother, incumbent March Fong Eu, spent most of the campaign for 
secretary of state ignoring Republican challenger Joan Milke Flores, but a 
hard-hitting television campaign by Flores has apparently caught Eu's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Flores last month began running a series of ads accusing Eu of waiving 
thousands of dollars in fines against her own campaign committees and against 
some powerful political players. Although independent statewide polls show 
Flores trailing by a large margin, Eu last week began running television ads 
that her campaign consultants a week earlier said would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's first race for an elected insurance commissioner, Democrat John 
Garamendi, a veteran legislator who recently resigned his state Senate seat, 
was a heavy favorite to defeat Republican Wes Bannister, a Huntington Beach 
insurance agent and former city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi raised 10 times more than Bannister in contributions and dominated 
advertising in the race. The candidates differed on a wide range of issues, 
particularly no-fault insurance, with Bannister favoring it and Garamendi, who 
once sponsored no-fault legislation, against it. 
</P>
<P>
Less noticed -- though not lacking in controversy -- were the races for seats 
on the State Board of Equalization. Two focused more on criminal allegations 
than the tax issues the board oversees. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic candidate in Los Angeles' District 4, Paul Carpenter, has been 
convicted on federal racketeering, extortion and conspiracy charges and is 
awaiting sentencing. The Democratic candidate in Northern California's District 
1, William Bennett, is being investigated by the Sacramento district attorney 
for allegedly cheating on his state travel claims. 
</P>
<P>
In any other contest the legal issues would probably mean certain victory for a 
challenger. But so little-noticed are these races that Republican candidates 
Joe Adams and Jeff Wallack were struggling just to get the word out about their 
opponents' legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
In District 2, which includes a corner of Los Angeles County, Democrat Brad 
Sherman and Republican Claude Parrish were sending out a flurry of campaign 
materials as they vie for a seat vacated by board Chairman Conway Collis. But 
in District 3, encompassing eight Southern California counties, Republican 
incumbent Ernest J. Dronenburg Jr. is so confident of victory that he is 
spending most of his time campaigning for the other Republican candidates for 
the board. Dronenburg's Democratic opponent is Floyd L. Morrow, a businessman, 
attorney and educator from San Diego.

BANNING OF GILL NETS ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recreational fishermen know all about gill nets. They call them indiscriminate, 
wasteful killers of marine life. They claim that gill nets deplete the sea of 
mammals, birds -- and of the fish the anglers like to catch. To these 
fishermen, a law banning their use is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial fishermen use gill nets to make a living or supplement their income. 
They consider the nets to be highly efficient, but there is a sense of 
discomfort about the controversy over their use. 
</P>
<P>
The long-simmering fight between those who fish for sport and those who depend 
on the sea for their livelihoods may be decided by the outcome of Tuesday's 
vote on Proposition 132. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would amend the state Constitution to prohibit gill or trammel 
nets -- one traps fish by the gills, the other entangles -- within three miles 
of the coast from Point Conception to the Mexican border, and within one mile 
of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The nets are temporarily prohibited in portions of Northern and Central 
California. Passage of Proposition 132 would make that permanent. 
</P>
<P>
The ban would go into effect Jan. 1, 1994. Commercial fishermen would be 
required to pay for permits -- at successively higher annual prices -- for use 
in the zone between Jan. 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1993. Compensation for the loss 
of their permits when the ban takes effect -- a onetime payment based on the 
average annual sale of the fisherman's catch -- would come from the sale of $3 
stamps required with the purchase of a one-year California sportfishing 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), who sponsored the initiative, has been 
on a five-year crusade to do away with the gear she calls "devastating, 
indiscriminate, wasteful and archaic." She has failed twice in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Her financial support has come largely from the people who figure to gain from 
a gill net ban -- those directly or indirectly related to the sportfishing 
industry. The contribution list -- $461,628 to qualify the measure for the 
ballot -- is loaded with the names of yacht owners and organizations with 
sportfishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Proposition 132 deny claims by the commercial fishing industry 
that the intent is to take away the livelihood of the near-shore gill-netters 
so there would be more fish for the recreational fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"We want fish for everybody in the future, for our kids, for their kids, for 
the commercial fishermen (who use less destructive gear)," said Charlie Davis, 
62, a member of the Avalon Tuna Club. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former commercial fisherman and party boat operator, points to the 
fate of the thresher shark, a powerful game fish with tremendous market value. 
It used to be heavily sought by sportfishermen, but now is caught incidentally 
and infrequently, many feel because of the gill net. Swordfish, once abundant 
around the Channel Islands and offshore, also has become scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Gill and trammel nets are spread over an area like large volleyball nets, and 
are practically invisible when under water. The nets are banned by several 
states and by some countries. If they are banned in Southern California, the 
commercial fishing industry says, the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen 
would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Gillnetters Assn. contend that consumers would pay 
significantly higher prices for fresh fish if Proposition 132 passes. Although 
58% of the seafood consumed in the United States is imported, fresh fish such 
as halibut, sea bass and rockfish -- all popular among recreational fishermen 
-- will be more difficult to come by and therefore more expensive, they say. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal biologists say there is no way to determine the exact impact 
of gill nets on fisheries. Records show that the annual halibut catch is 
divided about equally between commercial and recreational fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the resource question, gill net supporters must deal with what is 
being cast as a moral issue -- incidental killing of marine mammals and birds. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Fish and Game records show that more than 6,500 sea 
lions, harbor seals and harbor porpoises were killed in gill and trammel nets 
in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the number of sea lions that drowned in gill nets in California 
totaled more than 4,000, which, critics say, points to a bleak future for a 
species that rebounded under the protection of the Marine Mammal Act of 1972. 
The American Cetacean Society has recorded 61 instances of California gray 
whales becoming entangled in gill nets between 1980-89; 20 whales were known to 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing an average of 5% of the animals found anywhere have pieces of net 
attached to some part of their bodies," said Peter Howarth, director of the 
Marine Mammal Center in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Fish and Game Director Pete Bontadelli said department biologists 
have given him no reason to believe any of the species targeted by the gill 
nets are in serious trouble and that commercial gill net fishermen and the 
sportfishermen should have an equal share of marine resources. 
</P>
<P>
Biologist Maria Vojkovich, after observations on 1,558 near-shore gill net 
vessels operating in Southern California, determined that about 80% of the 
species taken were either sold for consumption, utilized as bait for a trap 
fishery, or returned alive. A recent tagging study involving California halibut 
determined that of the fish returned alive, 11% survived. 
</P>
<P>
These results contradict claims by the Committee to Ban Gillnets that "72% of 
everything caught in gill nets have no economic value to commercial fishermen, 
that 7 of 10 species are unmarketable -- yet they still die."

1990 BALLOT PAMPHLET -- IT TAKES A COLLEGE DEGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome, college sophomores, to the 1990 state ballot pamphlet and supplement. 
Thanks to strategically placed ink dots and patches of white space, experts say 
you can now understand more of the 224-page official voting guide. 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of the three-quarter-pound tome? Stay in school. You still need 
a college degree or perhaps a few semesters of graduate school to read much 
more than the ballot arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes it all so startling, is . . . major newspapers are written at the 
eighth-grade level," said Philip Dubois, a political scientist at UC Davis. 
"What the average citizen is being given day in and day out is at the 
eighth-grade level, but when it comes to Election Day, we feed them all of this 
stuff at 12th and 13th grade and above." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a suggestion by the California Commission on Campaign Finance, the 
title and summaries on each of the 28 propositions in this election's two-part 
pamphlet have been simplified for the first time. By rearranging sentences and 
paragraphs into lists, the new format reduces the complexity level of the 
information by one school grade, from three years of college to two, according 
to Robert Stern, the commission's co-director. 
</P>
<P>
The average adult Californian, state statistics show, has gone to school for 
12.6 years -- or roughly one semester beyond high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Without changing a word, it made it easier to follow," said Stern. "The 
problem with the ballot pamphlet is that it is intimidating when you get it. 
Just the heft of it makes it difficult for voters." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the simplified descriptions make up just a fraction of the 
pamphlet and supplement, which were mailed last month to 9.5 million households 
at a cost of $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 pages and 39,000 words devoted in the main pamphlet to Proposition 
128 -- the most voluminous of the ballot measures -- just half a page was used 
for the newly simplified title and summaries. The far more detailed and complex 
legislative analyst's discussion, by contrast, consumed 3 1/2 pages, and the 
actual text of the environmental initiative -- known by its proponents as "Big 
Green" -- an additional 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how anybody is going to get through it," said Bruce Cain, 
associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. 
"People don't read these things until right before the election, and then they 
are confronted with something the size of a small telephone book. People ask: 
Why doesn't somebody write a thoughtful dispassionate analysis that they can 
understand?" 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State March Fong Eu, aware of the problems, got permission from 
the Legislature this year to alter the format of the titles and summaries and 
to move the detailed text of the propositions -- generally regarded as the most 
tedious portion of the pamphlet -- to the rear. Both changes have been popular 
with the public, according to Eu spokeswoman Melissa Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Eu has also taken the unusual step of placing a voter survey in the pamphlet 
that was developed by Dubois and others at UC Davis. The 22-question survey is 
intended to gauge voter interest in the pamphlet and come up with ways to make 
it easier to read and understand. About 10,000 surveys had been returned by 
voters as of last week, including many with lengthy handwritten suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is quite a bit of pent-up frustration," Dubois said. "The amount of 
information, which is reflective of the amount of initiatives, has pushed 
voters to the limit in many cases." 
</P>
<P>
Various studies and polls have shown that well-intentioned voters become 
discouraged by a pamphlet that they perceive as unapproachable. Stern's group 
and others have recommended using color, graphs, photographs and charts to make 
the guide more interesting and understandable. The secretary of state's office 
also is considering including small summary boxes with each proposition that 
would explain the consequences of a "yes" and a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a void of usable information for many ballot measures, which leads to 
a form of electoral roulette, where voters make snap judgments based on very 
little information," said David Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young 
University who has studied California ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics say none of the changes would do much to improve voter understanding 
of ballot propositions because few people read the pamphlets and the measures 
are too complicated. Surveys have shown that between 13% and 33% of voters 
bother to look at the pamphlet before voting, with most voters turning instead 
to television advertising, direct mail and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
A recent California Poll found that almost four people in five think the 
propositions have become too complex to be understood by most voters. The same 
poll found that most voters expect to spend less than two hours reading the 
pamphlet before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Lee, a political scientist who serves on a state panel that reviews the 
wording of ballot pamphlet analyses, said simplifications such as "yes" and 
"no" boxes would be impossible to write because the consequences of many 
propositions are not known until after an election. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to make the language as clear as possible, as sensible as possible, 
but when you are faced with extraordinarily complicated measures, you cannot 
reduce them to simple 30-second television spots and still fulfill your job 
under the law," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, some say, may lie beyond the written word. Several groups have 
suggested creating a videocassette version of the pamphlet that voters could 
borrow from libraries and retail stores and watch in the comfort of their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
In a move in that direction, Eu for the first time has offered voters 
audiocassettes of the pamphlet and supplement, which previously were available 
only to the visually impaired. The cassettes, totaling more than 9 1/2 hours, 
have been so popular with commuters that Eu announced recently that she cannot 
keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts say the real problem with the ballot pamphlet is not the pamphlet 
-- be it written, audio or video -- but rather a political climate that has 
fostered so many ballot propositions and a lack of interest in elections among 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States generally, and California particularly, appear destined to 
set more records for no-shows at the ballot box," Eu said recently. "At a time 
when people around the world are opting in for democracy, the champions of 
democracy are opting out."

ISRAELI SOLDIERS KILL PALESTINIAN IN GAZA PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: 43 OTHERS ARE WOUNDED AS ARABS TAKE TO THE STREETS, ANGERED BY THE 
DEATH OF A JAILED ACTIVIST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian protester Saturday and wounded at least 
43 others who took to the streets with stones in the occupied Gaza Strip to 
protest the death of an activist in jail. 
</P>
<P>
A wave of street unrest has continued with few breaks since Oct. 8, when police 
in Jerusalem shot to death 20 Arab rioters at the Temple Mount, known as Haram 
al Sharif (noble sanctuary) to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, at least a dozen Palestinians have been fatally shot by police and 
soldiers, and three Israelis died in a knife attack in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The steady toll of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
appears to put a major dent in tactics designed by Defense Minister Moshe Arens 
to reduce Palestinian casualties and dilute criticism of Israel's handling of 
the Arab uprising, which is nearing its third anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The fatality in Gaza and the heavy toll of wounded Saturday came two days after 
U.N. General Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar called for the 164 nations that 
signed the Fourth Geneva Convention to meet and discuss how to protect 
Palestinians living under Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as in 
annexed Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Several provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which Israel is pledged to 
uphold, apply to the security of civilians in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
Israel rejects U.N. intervention on the grounds that it throws into question 
its sovereignty over Jerusalem and its claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Israel is "doing everything" to ensure the safety of Palestinians, a spokesman 
for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told an Israeli newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any lack of security, it derives from the violent activities of 
the Arabs against Israelis and their own brethren," said the spokesman, Yossi 
Ahimeir, in the Davar newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip on Saturday, residents of the Beit Hanoun refugee camp poured 
into the streets when word spread that Attiyeh Zanin, a detained uprising 
activist, had died in prison. Zanin was suspected of belonging to the outlawed 
Palestine Liberation Organization. Police told his family that the prisoner, 
who was jailed two weeks ago, hung himself Friday with a noose made from strips 
of a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
His family demanded an independent autopsy. Four Palestinians have died in the 
Gaza Strip jail while under interrogation. Three were reportedly suicides, and 
one died from blows to the stomach. Under government guidelines, Israeli police 
and domestic intelligence agents are permitted to use "limited" physical 
pressure on inmates during interrogation. Critics say the guidelines sanction 
torture. 
</P>
<P>
In Beit Hanoun, enraged groups of young men and boys stoned army patrols, which 
responded by firing rubber-coated metal pellets and regular lead-tipped 
bullets. The fatality, a 36-year-old man, was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Unrest spread to other towns and refugee camps in the crowded Gaza Strip. 
Police beat back rioters with tear gas and rifle fire, witnesses said. They 
also used an automatic gravel thrower to clear the streets. Among the injured 
hit by the mechanically flung stones was a 4-year-old boy, who was knocked 
unconscious and taken to a Tel Aviv hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian hospital officials said 113 people were wounded; the army put the 
figure at 43.

Iraq released four American hostages "for humanitarian reasons," including a 
49-year-old California man who had been held as a human shield at an 
undisclosed strategic site in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official said his nation would release all Western and Japanese 
hostages upon receiving a pledge that no military offensive would be launched 
against Iraq.

He said the pledge had to be made by either the U.N. Security Council or two of

DIPLOMACY: HIS MISSION ABROAD IS TO 'LAY THE FOUNDATION' FOR MILITARY ACTION IF 
THE EMBARGO FAILS.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, starting a weeklong trip to the Persian 
Gulf and Europe, said Saturday that he wants to find out if other members of 
the international coalition will share the fighting if the confrontation with 
Iraq escalates into war. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some questions we want to propound to some of our coalition 
partners," Baker said. "We'd like to know under what conditions and subject to 
what restraints they would be willing to consider certain types of actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some questions need to be answered if certain operations are going to be 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of his talks with the leaders of seven nations and the 
exiled government of Kuwait is to "lay the foundation" for military action to 
drive Iraq out of Kuwait, should the U.N. trade embargo prove inadequate to do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker often cloaks his meaning in euphemisms, his comments to 
reporters, made aboard his jet en route from Washington to a refueling stop in 
Ireland, are the most direct indication so far that the Bush Administration is 
actively discussing with its allies the terms for the use of military force in 
the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall purpose of this trip is to discuss with our coalition partners 
strengthening the full range of measures that we have employed to isolate 
(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein -- political measures, economic measures and 
military measures -- and thereby lay the foundation for the possible future 
exercise of all options," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will improve the prospects for a peaceful resolution (of the crisis) and 
at the same time permit us to be prepared to consider all the options if the 
peaceful ones don't work," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's first meetings are set for today in Bahrain, the island nation off the 
coast of Saudi Arabia that for more than 40 years has been the home port for 
the American naval presence in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Baker will meet with kings, presidents and prime ministers in Saudi 
Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Britain and France before returning to 
Washington next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker insisted that the United States hopes the trade embargo and 
other political and economic measures will ultimately force Iraq to end its 
occupation of Kuwait, he made it clear that Washington is not willing to wait 
forever. U.S. officials have said that the embargo has begun to cause real 
economic pain in Iraq but that Hussein appears able to hold out for months, if 
not years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker declined to give a time frame for U.S. action, but he said additional 
steps are being considered "in the short term." 
</P>
<P>
From a purely military standpoint, the United States apparently could initiate 
combat with Iraq on its own. About two-thirds of the military personnel in the 
international coalition are Americans. But Baker made it clear that the 
Administration wants to make sure its allies will go along if war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has said on several occasions that in moving to deal with this 
problem, he would like to maintain as much of the international consensus as he 
can," Baker said. "His actions to date certainly make that very clear." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to maintain the consensus, Baker said the Administration 
may ask the U.N. Security Council to specifically authorize the use of force -- 
although he said such a step is not necessary as a matter of international law. 
He repeated the Administration's position that Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, 
permitting "collective self-defense," provides all the authorization that would 
be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he will discuss the U.N. option with leaders of the four other 
permanent members of the Security Council during this trip. He will visit the 
Soviet Union, Britain and France, and he plans to meet with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the allies clearly are more eager to use force than others. For 
instance, President Turgut Ozal of Turkey has said his country would 
participate militarily against Iraq only if the action is specifically 
authorized by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, would be invaluable in any 
armed confrontation with Iraq because of its strategic location on Iraq's 
northern border.

While Lt. Guy Zanti's wife and father run a marathon today in Washington, the 
naval officer intends to match their efforts on the battleship Wisconsin in the 
waters of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Zanti became interested in marathon running in April when he watched his 
53-year-old father run his first marathon in California. 
</P>
<P>
Zanti told his father that even if he couldn't make it to today's Marine Corps 
Marathon, he would still run the 26.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been based in the Mediterranean, so he planned on training on land and 
the ship, and then running the marathon on land," said his father, Frank Zanti. 
"When this crisis came up, he was deployed to the gulf. But he didn't stop his 
training, and he's going to run on the ship." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin is 887 feet long, about one-sixth of a mile; the 29-year-old 
Zanti will have to make about 75 laps.

He said dozens of fishermen drove the dolphins toward Fukuejima, hoping to kill 
some for food. But hundreds became trapped by the receding tide and at least 
100 died on the sand, the official said. Dolphins are taken annually by local 
people because fish and meat are expensive in the isolated community, Kyodo 
News Service reported.

Thousands of Romanian demonstrators roamed the capital, blocked traffic and 
demanded the government's resignation in a third day of noisy protests against 
price rises. The demonstrations underlined the fragility of new elected 
governments in Eastern Europe's former Communist states as they try to switch 
from central planning to a market economy. The protests in Bucharest were 
ostensibly triggered when the National Salvation Front government scrapped 
price subsidies, but most slogans were directed specifically at President Ion 
Iliescu, a former Communist.

The Mozambican parliament unanimously approved a new constitution effective at 
the end of the month and establishing a multi-party democracy after 15 years of 
Marxist rule. 
</P>
<P>
People's Assembly deputies burst into applause on passing the constitution, 
drafted in response to a raging civil war, a shattered economy and intense 
public debate. Elections are expected to be held next July or August. The 
constitution also grants workers the right to strike, protects freedom of the 
press, guarantees an independent judiciary and renames the country the Republic 
of Mozambique, dropping the word People's.

U.S. military intelligence specialists, analyzing dozens of debriefings of 
loyalists to deposed Panama leader Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, report that a 
renegade former aide to Noriega planted his own men in the new Panamanian 
Public Force to prepare for future moves against the U.S.-backed government. 
The analysis, obtained by New York Newsday, focuses suspicion on Capt. Asuncion 
Eliezer Gaitan, a zealous Noriega aide, for plotting insurgency operations. 
Panamanian government sources are concerned that opponents, including Noriega, 
are capable of destabilizing the nation.

SENATE RACE RIVAL CRASHES HATFIELD NEWS CONFERENCE

<P>
Republican Sen. Mark O. Hatfield's opponent crashed one of his news 
conferences, then got in the last question by asking Hatfield to debate him 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, who has refused such requests from Democrat Harry Lonsdale, walked 
away without responding. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm conducting a press conference, not a circus," Hatfield said later when 
asked what he thought about Lonsdale's visit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When Lonsdale appeared, Hatfield stumbled over his words before regaining his 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
Lonsdale stood silently as Hatfield criticized his opponent again for 
supporting Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1985 after the Indian guru pleaded guilty 
to federal crimes. Lonsdale's claim that he was merely defending religious 
freedom does not wash, Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't religious freedom; it's a question of judgment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lonsdale later criticized Hatfield for witnessing a shooting last year in 
Washington, D.C., and failing to report it to police. 
</P>
<P>
"As a citizen he had an obligation. As a senator, he had no excuse," Lonsdale 
said. "We all make mistakes and do things we regret. But Mark Hatfield should 
reflect on his own failings before he criticizes my judgment." 
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference, Gary Kahn, Lonsdale's campaign counsel, called 
for a three-county task force to investigate a burglary at Lonsdale's home last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Deschutes County sheriff's office said the investigation has failed to turn 
up any suspects. Kahn stressed that he was not accusing the Hatfield campaign 
of committing the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Julie McGregor, a spokeswoman for Hatfield, said the senator feels "it's 
unfortunate that such a crime should occur so close to an election, but it's 
equally unfortunate that Lonsdale is trying to lay blame on Hatfield 
supporters."

DEFICIT BILL TO COST TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR $321 A YEAR, ANALYSIS FINDS

<P>
The deficit-reduction bill awaiting President Bush's signature will cost the 
average family of four $321 a year, with additional taxes spread nearly evenly 
among the states, a new analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
The average increase will range from $151 per family in West Virginia to $578 
in Connecticut, according to computations by Citizens for Tax Justice, a 
labor-financed research group. 
</P>
<P>
The changes will take an average 0.6% of family income on a national basis, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The bite on family income will be within one-tenth of a percentage point of the 
national average in every state except Connecticut (0.8%) and West Virginia 
(0.4%). 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, states with the highest incomes will face slightly 
higher-than-average . . . tax hikes as a share of income, while those with the 
lowest average incomes will pay the least in additional taxes," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On a national basis, the median tax increase will be $183, meaning that half 
the four-member families will see tax increases of less than $183 and half will 
see increases of more.

HOMELESS USED TO HAWK PAPERS, GROUPS CHARGE

Homeless advocates charged Saturday that the Daily News is exploiting the 
homeless by giving them free copies of the strikebound tabloid to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"The Daily News is using homeless people as the cheapest form of labor to hawk 
their newspaper. This is the lowest form of exploitation imaginable," said a 
statement issued by 14 advocacy groups for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We condemn this action as a cynical maneuver on the part of the Daily News' 
management to use homeless people as strike breakers," the groups said, 
charging that the homeless were being pitted against the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the tabloid, whose nine unions struck last week in the midst 
of bitter and unfruitful contract negotiations, denied that the News is 
recruiting the homeless to sell the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the homeless on occasion are taking copies of the Daily News, which in 
many cases have been stolen by union members," said the spokeswoman, Lisa 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't stand in the way if the homeless want to earn money selling papers," 
she said. "We are providing free samples in many locations around New York. New 
Yorkers have a right to their hometown paper," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson later issued a firmer statement saying: "It's absolutely untrue. We 
are not giving newspapers to the homeless and asking them to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Brosnahan, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for the Homeless, said she 
talked with about half a dozen homeless people selling copies of the News that 
they said they received free. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that most of them were getting a quarter for it," she said. "They were 
perplexed. They didn't quite understand what was going on, just that they were 
given newspapers from out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
The News, unable to distribute many of the 875,000 to 1.6 million papers it 
prints daily, began giving away 200,000 copies of the newspapers a day. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insisted that management was "ready and willing" to resume 
negotiations, while a Newspaper Guild spokesman said the newspaper has refused 
to schedule meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, union officials were waiting to receive a response from News 
management to an offer from Jesse Jackson to mediate the return to work of all 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson ignored pleas from the News' publisher Friday and appeared at a strike 
rally outside the paper's 42nd Street building.

Skeletal remains found in Manhattan were believed to be those of a former 
Haitian slave under consideration for sainthood, a medical examiner said. The 
former slave, Pierre Toussaint, was buried at the cemetery where the bones were 
found after his death in 1853 at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
As a preliminary part of the Roman Catholic Church's consideration for 
sainthood, his skeletal remains were sought and were scheduled to be moved to 
St. Patrick's Cathedral. They eventually would be distributed in Haiti and 
prominent churches if the church makes him a saint. Toussaint was born a slave 
in Haiti and moved to New York with his owner's family in 1787. After becoming 
a hairdresser, he supported his owner's wife and child for 20 years after his 
owner died. Officials have said they hope Toussaint could be approved for 
sainthood by the time Pope John Paul II visits Haiti in 1992 to celebrate the 
500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus.

The Commission on Judicial Performance is investigating Judge Irene Takahashi,

said she did not reveal her affair with El Cerrito Officer Michael Ramirez as 
she should have before an October, 1989, preliminary hearing. Takahashi said 
her failure to disclose the relationship deprived two defendants of their

STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
SMITH CALLS LUNGREN HYPOCRITICAL ON MAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The battle of the misleading slate mailers heated up another notch Saturday 
with Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith accusing Republican 
opponent Dan Lungren of trying to deceive Democratic voters through his 
appearance on a mass mailing to Los Angeles-area Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Lungren is duplicitous and hypocritical," Smith said, citing a slate 
mailer distributed over the weekend titled "Attention Democrats: Election Day 
Voting Guide." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer, festooned with an American flag, endorses Democratic state 
candidates, including Dianne Feinstein for governor, Leo T. McCarthy for 
lieutenant governor and March Fong Eu for secretary of state. However, for 
attorney general, the mailer endorses Lungren, who paid for his name to be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren on Friday held a press conference in Los Angeles to criticize the 
inclusion of Smith's name on a mailer called the Republican Vote by Mail 
Project. In addition, the state Republican Party filed an official complaint 
with the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Smith, Lungren wrote that the mailer "interfere(d) in the 
democratic process by falsely suggesting that I am not supported by my party, 
or worse, that you are the Republican endorsed candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "First he was criticizing the fact I was on one of these mailers -- 
now he's on one. . . . He's got a double standard." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren spokesman Dave Puglia defended the former five-term congressman's 
inclusion on the earlier mailer, saying the new mailer "makes absolutely no 
pretenses about being an official party mailer." Moreover, Puglia said, the 
mailer clearly indicates with an asterisk that Lungren paid to be included, 
whereas the Republican Vote mailer endorsing Smith contained no similar 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
"What's misleading about it when it says, 'Attention Democrats'?" Puglia asked. 
"Does it say anywhere that Democrats can't vote for Dan Lungren? We think many 
Democrats will." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Carey of Republic Communications, which published the mailer, said Saturday 
that he took an extra step to avoid deception by including, in small print, the 
statement, "Candidates selected independent of party affiliation." The mailer, 
however, does not identify Lungren as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer sent to Democratic voters also includes paid endorsements of 
Republican State Board of Equalization candidates Claude W. Parrish and Joe 
Adams.

CAMPAIGN: PRESIDENT SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE IS NOT NEEDED. EPA CHIEF 
CALLS GOALS 'LAUDABLE' BUT SAYS MEASURE IS 'NOT ESSENTIAL.'

<P>
Even as he sought to wrap himself in the mantle of the state's environmental 
movement, President Bush announced Saturday that he is opposed to Proposition 
128, the "Big Green" environmental proposition on the California ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the President said at a rally for Sen. Pete Wilson's 
gubernatorial campaign that the initiative was not needed to protect the 
environment, his chief environmental adviser sidestepped an opportunity to join 
Bush in opposing the measure. While voicing some criticisms, William K. Reilly, 
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said he found its goals 
"laudable." 
</P>
<P>
The President delivered a speech offering unqualified, if unspecific, support 
for environmental issues, during an invitation-only tree planting ceremony on 
the California Lutheran University campus. Afterward, at a public political 
rally on the campus, with Wilson at his side, he said that "to keep our 
environment green, we don't have to be Big Green." 
</P>
<P>
Bush had not previously expressed himself on the statewide measure. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 is an initiative backed by a variety of environmental groups. 
It would phase out a number of cancer-causing chemicals used in pesticides and 
products that harm the ozone, limit the discharge of toxic chemicals into the 
ocean, require safeguards for oil tankers, and streamline enforcement of 
anti-pollution laws. 
</P>
<P>
On a day of both political and environmental symbolism, Bush hailed the passage 
of the first federal clean air bill in 13 years, describing the measure 
recently completed by Congress as "the most significant air pollution 
legislation in the history of this country." He said he would sign it, as 
expected, within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of a new era for clean air," he said as he took the 
symbolic step of turning over a spadeful of loose soil at the base of an 
already planted oak tree on the campus of the 31-year-old private college. 
</P>
<P>
To deliver the message of environmental protection and lend his presidential 
coattails to Wilson three days before the election, Bush went considerably out 
of his way. He flew into Southern California aboard Air Force One on Friday 
night after a campaign appearance in Sioux Falls, Iowa. Immediately after the 
appearance with Wilson, he headed to Albuquerque, N.M., and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly joined the Bush Administration after a career in the mainstream of the 
environmental protection movement. When asked about Proposition 128, he found 
himself caught between the President's opposition and the support the measure 
has received among environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently trying to politely leave some space between his position and Bush's, 
Reilly said he had taken no position on the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the goals are laudable," he told reporters after attending the campus 
rally. He also said that it had not been scientifically proven that Proposition 
128's limits on pesticides were necessary and that its regulations would only 
be established at "substantial economic cost." 
</P>
<P>
"It will have a tremendous influence on the rest of the country," he said, 
referring to the impact California initiatives, including those limiting 
taxation, have had on national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"If Big Green does pass, we will work with it, trying to ensure it is 
integrated into our national laws," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the measure is "not essential." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Gov. George Deukmejian in his weekly radio broadcast also urged 
voters to oppose Proposition 128 as well as Proposition 134, the so-called 
nickel-a-drink alcohol tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental issues arose on a sparkling autumn morning -- picture-perfect 
for Bush's focus on the environment and the symbolic planting of a sapling 
beside a grove of eucalyptus trees.

The clean air bill that Bush said he would soon sign is considered one of the 
major pieces of legislation to come out of the 101st Congress. It makes changes 
in a 13-year-old air pollution measure, at a cost to industry and individuals 
that has been estimated at between $25 billion and $35 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said it would remove 56 billion pounds of pollution from the air each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was approved only after compromises were hammered out between 
environmentalists and those fearful of its impact on the economy, as well as 
those concerned that it would too strictly limit the automobile industry. 
</P>
<P>
The President said it would "cut in half the emissions that cause acid rain," 
the tree-killing pollution caused when airborne pollutants mix with moisture in 
the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"It will cut the emissions that cause smog in our cities, so that by the end of 
this century more than 100 major U.S. cities will have cleaner, healthier air," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He praised its encouragement of the use of "alternative fuels," such as those 
derived from agricultural products rather than from the world's limited and 
polluting fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is right, the people are ready, and industry is responding," Bush 
said of the development of alternative fuels.

TRAILER PARK TENANTS FILE LAWSUIT ALLEGING POOR LIVING CONDITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HAWTHORNE: COMPLAINT CHARGES THAT THE IMPERIAL TRAILER PARK HAS VIOLATED 
NUMEROUS CITY AND STATE HEALTH CODES. TENANTS ASK FOR IMPROVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Outside the Imperial Trailer Park in Hawthorne stands a rusty sign with missing 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the park, exposed electrical wires lie entangled between trailers. In 
some places, the ground is damp -- a condition tenants attribute to a constant 
overflow of the septic system -- and an odor of sewage pervades the park. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that they have put up with these and other substandard conditions 
for years, residents of the park have filed a civil lawsuit against the park's 
owners, asking that improvements be made and punitive damages assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-page complaint, filed in Torrance Superior Court in September, charges 
that Sam and Vera Menlo and the Menlo Trust and Century Quality Management, 
which is owned by the Menlos, have violated many city and state health codes 
and have neglected their duties as landlords to make the park a livable and 
safe environment. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone, Sam Menlo said he was not aware of the lawsuit and declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the park's resident manager, Harriet Vernon, said she calls repair 
workers whenever tenants report problems, and she placed the blame for some of 
the park's deficiencies on the residents themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, who has managed the park for seven years, said tenants sometimes 
"destroy the property" by attempting their own repairs and that they sometimes 
cause power failures because they "don't have the proper facilities in their 
trailers." 
</P>
<P>
But tenants say problems at the park are not their fault. The suit alleges 
numerous health and safety problems, including repeated power failures, septic 
tank overflows, flooding in the laundry room, poor lighting, unsafe electrical 
wiring, leaking gas lines and inadequate trash removal. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five of the families who live in the park's 81 units are plaintiffs in 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, tenants said they hope the lawsuit will bring improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want whatever is fair, whatever is right," said Bruce Montgomery, 34, a 
gardener who has lived at the park for five years and pays $305 a month. "I 
stay here 'cause the rent is cheap." 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who say they don't make enough money to move elsewhere, say they are 
also angry because they have been told their rents will be increased by an 
average of $20 beginning this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The money you pay is not worth it at all," said Joseph Goff, 53, whose monthly 
rent is $410. "I would never think of raising a family here. Never. The owners 
have never done anything to improve the trailer park and make it a better 
place." 
</P>
<P>
The Menlos acquired the park at 3670 W. Imperial Highway in 1984, according to 
the suit, and residents say conditions in the park have been declining 
steadily. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Southern California Edison completely cut off the park's electrical 
power at the request of a city inspector who cited the park for health code 
violations. Some of the power was restored five days later. But it was not 
until two weeks later that electrical power was completely restored, and many 
residents say they had to rely on candles, kerosene lamps and flashlights in 
the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Colclasure, a park resident for four years, contacted KCBS-TV, which 
aired a story about the blackout. Sam Menlo later sent a contractor to fix the 
electrical problems, Colclasure said, but tenants held a meeting and decided to 
file the suit because other problems still had not been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Don Knechtel, director of Hawthorne's Department of Building and Safety, said 
the trailer park has had electrical problems periodically over the years. 
Knechtel, who requested May's power cutoff, said that when he inspected the 
park, he also noticed other health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the violations included placing too many trailer units in the park, 
limiting the amount of space between trailers; exposed electrical wires lying 
on the ground, posing hazards to any child playing nearby, and overflowing 
sewage from a septic system, resulting in odorous and unhealthy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Sam Menlo, whose assets include nursing homes, apartment 
buildings and hospitals, has a history of similar complaints against him in 
other business operations. In 1979, Menlo was cited for more than 2,000 health 
code violations at several Los Angeles nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Knechtel, who said the park had not been previously cited for any violations, 
forwarded his findings last month to the state Department of Housing and 
Community Development for further inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Kathie Parrish, a spokeswoman for the department, said the state's inspector 
found 301 violations at the park, 190 of which were charged to the park's 
owners. "The tenants themselves are responsible for 111 violations," Parrish 
said. Some of those, she said, resulted from residents' attempts to make 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Both the park and the residents have until the end of this month to correct 
their violations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gina Cobb, a four-year resident of the park, was cited for three violations: 
not having a specific type of electrical connection, clutter under her trailer 
and a burned electrical power box. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said the power box short-circuited when Menlo's repair workers attempted 
to restore electricity during an outage. "It's embarrassing to think they would 
come to cite us for things that are beyond our control," Cobb said. "It's 
adding insult to injury." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said many of the cited tenants are upset and they plan to have a meeting 
to discuss these violations. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Sparks, who was cited for having combustible material in cardboard boxes 
and for having overgrown weeds around his trailer, said he thinks his citations 
were justified. However, he said he intends to correct the violations by the 
end of the month and that they have no bearing on the suit.

INGLEWOOD SELECTS DEVELOPMENT HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood officials Friday named a former Los Angeles County development 
specialist, Jesse J. Lewis, as the city's new director of development. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who will begin the new post Dec. 3, will help create new development 
projects. He will also head the city's efforts to redevelop areas under the 
flight path of Los Angeles International Airport and to build low- and 
moderate-income housing, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Development has been a key issue in Inglewood, which has experienced a boom in 
residential building in some areas but lags in commercial projects in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
In his post with the Los Angeles Community Development Commission, Lewis worked 
on projects that included a shopping center and single-family and multifamily 
housing developments.

QUIET ARREST FOR LONGSHOREMAN AT CENTER OF MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 49-year-old longshoreman has been arrested for non-payment of child support 
three weeks after his attempted arrest at a union hall led to a strike that 
briefly closed the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district attorney's office reported that Roy Neal was 
apprehended just after 5 a.m. Friday as he attempted to pick up a paycheck at 
the Wilmington payroll office of the Pacific Maritime Association, which 
represents shippers and other waterfront employers. 
</P>
<P>
Neal, whose address is unknown, was arrested without incident and remains in 
custody at County Jail on $5,000 bail. He is charged with violating probation 
for allegedly failing to pay $3,904 in support payments for his two children, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In arresting Neal, the district attorney's office sent six investigators to the 
maritime association office, fearing a repeat of an Oct. 10 melee at the 
dispatch hall of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, 
Local 13. The hall in Wilmington was the scene of an angry confrontation 
between 300 longshoremen and authorities when two district attorney's 
investigators entered the building with an arrest warrant for Neal. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Oct. 10 confrontation, about 500 longshoremen walked off their 
jobs at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, idling 30 ships and tens of 
millions of dollars in cargo. During subsequent talks with maritime association 
officials, the longshoremen's leaders acknowledged that the 13-hour walkout was 
illegal under the union's contract with employers. In addition, the union 
agreed the striking workers would lose one day's pay, roughly $200 per 
longshoreman.

WHAT GOES INTO CHOOSING THE RIGHT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a high school senior, November is more than just the start of the 
holiday season. It's also college season. You're probably skimming college 
catalogues and soon you'll start filling out applications. But with so many 
different colleges to choose from around the country -- or even just in 
California -- how do you pick the right one? 
</P>
<P>
College counselors from some local schools and my own college-bound seniors at 
Santa Monica High School helped me to make a list of the most important 
considerations in choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agreed that the foremost question is whether to go away to college or 
stay home and commute to school. Generally, students strongly prefer distance 
if it's financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"Many young people look upon college as the socially acceptable way of leaving 
home, a rite of passage," said Mickey Braimen, college counselor at Fairfax 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
My students agree. "You shouldn't live at home," said senior Lena George. "It 
would just be like going to work every day; you go to school, then you come 
home. That's not a real change." 
</P>
<P>
The size of the college is also important, because a biology class of 25 
students is starkly different from a class of 400. Large schools such as UCLA 
or UC Berkeley offer benefits such as world-class scholars, more clubs and 
activities, a wider range of courses and greater resources such as libraries 
and labs. But for all that you usually sacrifice personal contact with your 
teachers, and in fact may receive most of your instruction from teaching 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors may draw you to a smaller college. "If you're coming from a small 
high school, it would be unwise for you to jump into a freshman class of five 
or six thousand unless you were one of the top students at your high school," 
said Bette Irwin, a counselor at Culver City High School. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Tom is a top honors student at Santa Monica High School, but still opts 
for a small college because of the lower teacher-student ratio. "I would go to 
UCLA only if I had no other choice left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget the real reason to attend college: academics. The obvious 
question to ask about a college is whether it offers your intended major. A 
well-rounded school is best, though, because counselors warn that you'll 
probably change your major several times before you've earned your degree. 
</P>
<P>
Browsing through college catalogues is the best way to explore the school's 
academic value. See what courses are offered and the descriptions of those 
courses. See what kind of credentials the professors have. 
</P>
<P>
To decide whether you and a college are well-suited for each other, compare 
your own academic standing with those of the school's typical incoming 
freshman. "I look at the SAT score range, grade-point average, and class 
rankings," said senior John Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"People should consider the college's graduation rate," suggested Marilyn 
Goodman, counselor at Crenshaw High School. "Some say they're interested in a 
certain school and they have no idea that only 20% of the students there 
graduate." 
</P>
<P>
Cost cannot be ignored as a factor, but even the poorest students can attend 
the most prestigious schools. Forty percent of UC Berkeley students and 
two-thirds of Harvard students receive financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cost is a great determinant for some students. "If I can get a 
partial scholarship to Loyola, I'll go," said Scott Juergens, a Santa Monica 
senior. "If not, then UC (Santa Barbara) looks pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, counselors and students agree, the question is whether you have a 
sense of "belonging" at a particular college, or, as student Lena George asks, 
"Will I fit in?" 
</P>
<P>
Minority students should check a school's minority enrollment rate and cultural 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The last step -- and probably the most telling -- is to visit the campus while 
classes are in session. Do you feel lost, or could you eventually feel at home 
there? Who's teaching the classes and how many students are in the room? Are 
the dorm rooms big enough, and will you really eat the cafeteria food? 
</P>
<P>
Talk to 20 or 30 students you see on campus. This may seem awkward, but such 
candid conversations are more real than any catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Once you're through all these steps and you've mailed the applications, the 
sweetest and easiest part comes: saying yes to the right school and no to all 
the others. 
</P>

HMO IRON MAN LEAVES QUITE A HEALTHY LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: DR. ROBERT GUMBINER BUILT FHP INTERNATIONAL CORP. INTO A MIGHTY 
HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION EVEN AS OTHERS FELL BY THE WAYSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The short, bearded man in a gray, double-breasted suit walked swiftly through a 
Long Beach medical clinic, pivoting often to point out cosmetic flaws that 
might mar the image of the health-care organization he spent a lifetime 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's young managers obediently took notes as Dr. Robert Gumbiner 
pointed scornfully to some tattered telephone directories, wheelchairs that 
obstructed a hallway and two pictures hung askew in a waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
Then, noticing that one manager had placed a framed picture of his wife on his 
desk, he said: "I worry about people who have their offices cluttered with 
family photos. I wonder if they wouldn't rather be home." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 30 years, Gumbiner has ruled FHP International Corp. like a military 
general. His tour of duty ends Nov. 14, when the 67-year-old Gumbiner steps 
down as chief executive of the Fountain Valley-based health maintenance 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Although he'll remain FHP's chairman and a consultant, Gumbiner will no longer 
be involved in the company's day-to-day operations. His replacement will be 
Westcott W. Price III, currently president and vice chairman, whom Gumbiner has 
been grooming for the top job since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Since founding FHP in 1961, Gumbiner has built it into a large and consistently 
profitable medical company that was one of the first to embrace government 
assistance programs for the poor and elderly when others thought them too 
risky. It is widely regarded as one of the best-managed HMOs in the industry. 
Key reasons for FHP's success, observers say, are Gumbiner's own management 
skills along with his knack for recruiting talented MBAs and veteran executives 
from other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Described as tough, outspoken and detail-oriented, Gumbiner is regarded by 
former and current employees with a mixture of fear and admiration. He demands 
dedication and loyalty from his employees, they say, and wants them to share 
his passion for the HMO concept. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner's no-nonsense management style hasn't always made him popular with 
employees or the medical community. Asked to describe his reputation, he 
retorted: "I couldn't care less." 
</P>
<P>
Then he added: "I guess it (his reputation) is that I can get things done, but 
that I am not easy to get along with." 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt that Gumbiner has been the driving force behind FHP's 
success during the last three decades, a period during which many other HMOs 
have failed. The company operates 49 medical facilities and employs 7,500 part- 
and full-time workers. Its membership has swelled from 250,000 in 1986 to 
566,000 now. It has operations in California, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and 
Guam, with its biggest presence in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The company has grown at a 20% annual clip since going public in 1986. It ranks 
second in earnings among the nation's publicly traded HMOs -- after U.S. Health 
Care in Pennsylvania -- and was one of the few HMOs to remain profitable during 
the industry's darkest times in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
For its fiscal year ended June 30, FHP earned $28.7 million, up from $22 
million the previous year, on revenue of $980 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner has often marched to a different drummer than the medical 
establishment, putting him at odds with his physician peers. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, for example, the medical community was resisting the rise of 
managed health care as a threat to physicians' financial and professional 
freedom. But Gumbiner was among the few doctors who foresaw the value of HMOs 
in providing medical treatment to people who otherwise might not be able to 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking the medical establishment "was sort of a challenge," Gumbiner said. "I 
figured I was right and the rest of the world was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner decries the medical community's traditional practice of charging fees 
for individual services as "basically immoral." Besides making medical care 
unaffordable for low-income families, he says, the practice encourages doctors 
and hospitals to perform unnecessary services to generate more income. 
</P>
<P>
Prepaid services such as HMOs, on the other hand, are financially motivated to 
prescribe only what medical services are necessary, Gumbiner argues. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner "is very crusty and blustery, but has very egalitarian ideals," says 
Dr. Tom Mayer, FHP's medical director from 1985 to 1987 and currently an 
executive with an employee benefits consulting firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born in St. Louis, Gumbiner said he entered the medical profession at the 
insistence of his father, a doctor who wanted his son to follow in his 
footsteps. "He said he would pay my tuition at medical school and no other 
school," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Indiana School of Medicine in 1948, Gumbiner moved to 
Southern California. He got his first look at prepaid medicine while working at 
a San Pedro clinic operated by Ross Loos, one of the original HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
After resigning from Ross Loos and failing in several attempts to operate 
private group medical practices, Gumbiner in 1955 enrolled in a management 
course at UCLA. More familiar with blood tests than balance sheets, he 
remembers the class as an eye-opening experience that led to his taking 
hundreds of management classes throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Gumbiner joined nine doctors in Long Beach to form a private 
group practice that began offering a prepaid medical plan to any patients who 
wanted to join. It proved so popular, he recalled, that soon half the patients 
were signed up. Gumbiner was delighted, but the other doctors began to fear the 
plan would cause them to lose income. When Gumbiner went on vacation, the other 
doctors voted to kill the plan. The partnership disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
By 1961, Gumbiner had formed a nonprofit HMO under the name Family Health Plan, 
which later was changed to FHP Inc. because of the public's misconception that 
the company was involved with family planning, Gumbiner said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Gumbiner decided that FHP would be the first health maintenance 
organization in California to contract with Medicaid and he lobbied Congress 
for the passage of Medicare, the health care program for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
FHP's growth was dramatic from the start. The company landed large contracts 
with the City of Long Beach, and got its biggest boost in 1969 when it won a 
state contract to provide medical care for Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Medicare and Medicaid have added substantially to the growth 
and profitability of FHP. The Fountain Valley company now provides medical care 
to 25,000 Medicaid recipients and 72,000 seniors through its contract with 
Medicare, giving it the second-largest Medicare membership enrollment of any 
HMO. 
</P>
<P>
FHP's success at enrolling Medi-Cal recipients seemed to backfire in 1977, when 
the company temporarily lost its state contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of our gross revenue disappeared and probably all of our profit," 
Gumbiner recalled. By boosting marketing and cutting other costs, FHP managed 
to survive. A year later, it won back the Medi-Cal contract. 
</P>
<P>
These days, industry analysts warn the company that it is becoming too 
dependent on a Medicare program that could disappear with a change in national 
policy. FHP's Senior Plan now represents 31% of the company's membership and 
about 60% of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Gumbiner doesn't always heed what analysts tell him. After all, he recalls, 
analysts advised him in the early 1980s to expand nationally like Los 
Angeles-based Maxicare Health Plans Inc. -- before the giant HMO ran out of 
money and ended up in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
What the analysts don't understand this time, Gumbiner contends, is the 
political clout of the country's aging population. Senior citizens "write 
letters and vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While many other HMOs contract for services that are provided to their members 
by private doctors and physicians, under Gumbiner's leadership FHP has become 
an organization that delivers as well as manages medical care. 
</P>
<P>
It has forged a network of private medical practices and hospitals to assist 
its growth. And it has complemented those alliances by building and operating 
its own hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
FHP has attempted to control costs and quality by controlling as many products 
and services of its own as possible. It owns a fleet of ambulances, packages 
prescription drugs and sells a line of privately labeled over-the-counter 
drugs. It operates diagnostic laboratories and an optometry business where it 
makes its own lenses. 
</P>
<P>
As the company grew, Gumbiner adopted a "matrix" management system in which 
administrators report to two supervisors. Managers are frequently rotated to 
new jobs. One objective is to nurture greater depth of management expertise in 
the organization. Another is to prevent complacency. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of the matrix," Gumbiner says, "is that it causes turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Not all employees are comfortable in such an atmosphere. "There are some pretty 
good HMO managers around the country who have been fired by Bob," said James 
Doherty, president of the Group Health Assn. of America, a Washington-based

Gumbiner scoffs. Most of the managers who left to join competitors or were 
fired "just don't get anything done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As FHP has prospered, so has Gumbiner, a millionaire many times over. He owns a 
10.9% stake in FHP that on paper is worth about $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner says he has no regrets about stepping down as chief executive of FHP. 
"As you get to be a bigger company, you need more professional management and 
fewer entrepreneurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, health-care analyst for the Newport Beach investment bank 
Cruttenden &amp; Co., said it's necessary for Gumbiner "to make a clean break 
so the whole organization realizes the people brought in by the founder really 
are the people in charge." 
</P>
<P>
In retirement, Gumbiner expects to continue his lifelong activities as an art 
collector and avid traveler. He is building a 6,000-square-foot residence on 
Los Alamitos Bay in Long Beach, which he says will have ample wall space and 
special lighting for his art collection.

PERSONAL FINANCE: NEW RULES ADD INCENTIVE FOR TAX-LOSS SELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get ready for a heavier-than-normal year-end rush of investors selling stocks 
and other assets to recognize losses for tax purposes, many experts say. Thanks 
to the poor stock market and new tax rules, many individuals and institutions 
have a greater incentive to engage in tax-loss selling this year. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, if you have investment losers and want to take the losses, 
consider selling now before the crowd drives down the value of your investment 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-loss selling is a good practice in any year if you have capital gains or 
ordinary income to shelter. Tax laws allow you to use capital losses to reduce 
capital gains dollar for dollar. If your capital losses exceed your gains, you 
can use up to $3,000 of the losses to shelter ordinary income from wages. You 
can carry forward any leftover capital losses to future years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have already taken some gains, and have losses in stocks that you are 
not particularly satisfied with, sell those losers and take those losses now," 
advises William G. Brennan, partner with the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This selling -- along with further dumping by professional money managers 
seeking to "dress up" their portfolios for year-end reports -- often drives 
down stock prices in late November and December. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to this year's moribund stock and real estate markets, many more 
investors are likely to be holding losers. That, plus the gloomy outlook for 
many stocks and real estate, could prompt more year-end selling than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a very weak market, so obviously more people have losses," says Kurt 
Brouwer, president of Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San Francisco money 
management firm. Stocks most vulnerable to a selloff, he says, include issues 
that have already taken a heavy beating, such as banks, savings and loans, 
insurance and brokerage firms, retailers, telephone and technology firms, and 
small-company stocks in general. 
</P>
<P>
New tax provisions enacted last week as part of the federal budget accord could 
prompt even more investors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you're now in the 33% individual tax bracket -- the so-called 
bubble -- you may want to sell losers. That's because your rate next year will 
fall to 31% or less; thus, your losses are more valuable this year because they 
will shelter capital gains or wages being taxed at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
You may also want to sell winners if you are a very high income taxpayer now in 
the 28% bracket. Because the budget accord phases out exemptions and reduces 
deductions for wealthy taxpayers, you could end up paying a slightly higher 
capital gains rate next year. So you might want to take gains this year, 
particularly if you think those winners may turn into losers if you hold them 
much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another group that may want to sell now includes those who wanted to sell 
earlier but waited in hopes that Congress would lower capital gains rates. 
Since that bid failed, those people may be inclined to sell now. 
</P>
<P>
What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
First, don't let taxes be your sole motivation for selling. The rise or fall in 
price of a stock or other investment can easily outweigh any tax benefit. 
Accordingly, base your decision primarily on your outlook for the investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is a good time to ask yourself, would I buy this stock today at this 
price?" Brouwer says. "If the answer is 'no,' you should sell it." 
</P>
<P>
If you have mutual funds, you need not be as concerned about tax-loss selling, 
Brouwer adds. That's because the fund's portfolio manager usually takes care of 
selling losers in the portfolio to minimize your tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
What if you have a loser but are optimistic that the stock may go up? 
</P>
<P>
Consider selling it and then buying it back at least a month later. The "wash 
sale" rule prohibits you from recognizing a capital loss on a security that you 
sell and buy back within 30 days. But if you wait 31 days to buy back the same 
stock, who knows? You might get it cheaper if tax-loss selling is rampant. 
</P>
<P>
What if you have a winner but think it will become a dog? 
</P>
<P>
You can delay taking the capital gain until next year -- when your tax rate 
might be lower -- yet still lock in the profit now and protect yourself from 
further losses. How? By a technique known as "selling short against the box." 
Under this method, you sell borrowed securities -- what is called selling short 
-- identical to the ones you own. Next year, you sell your original securities 
to close out your short position. 
</P>
<P>
If you have appreciated real estate or other non-publicly traded assets, 
consider deferring the gain through an installment sale, suggests Sidney Kess, 
an accountant and tax attorney in New York. This way you can spread your gain 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, if you have losses, "do it as soon as possible" to avoid the 
year-end rush, suggests Adrian Moravcsik, financial consultant with Bailard 
Biehl &amp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., financial planning firm. His firm's 
clients have already taken their losses, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But selling is not the only option. If you have appreciated assets, consider 
donating them as a charitable contribution. This way you won't be liable for 
the capital gains tax, and under most situations you can take a deduction for 
the value of the property. (But don't do this if you have a loser. Instead, 
sell it and donate the proceeds; that way you get to report the capital loss.) 
</P>
<P>
Another option to reduce capital gains is to give appreciated assets to your 
children, Brennan suggests. They can then sell the assets and be taxed at their 
presumably lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, don't just think in terms of selling. Price declines resulting from 
mass year-end dumping could result in good buying opportunities, Brouwer says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see a company or mutual fund you are following pushed down, this is 
going to be a good time to take some positions," he says.

MUTUAL FUNDS: CLOSED-END FUNDS ARE A BARGAIN DURING SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something inherently gratifying about getting a bargain, whether it's a 
knickknack for the house or an investment. Among mutual funds, the red-tag 
sales are being held in the closed-end department. 
</P>
<P>
Even in normal times, most closed-end funds sell below their "net asset value," 
or NAV -- the per-share worth of the securities held. At the moment, with the 
stock and bond markets in a slump, there are more potential bargains than 
usual. "We're seeing some of the best buying opportunities in years," declares 
Thomas J. Herzfeld, head of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a closed-end money 
management and research firm based in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Closed-end funds are diversified, professionally managed portfolios that invest 
in stocks, bonds and, occasionally, other assets. Unlike regular, open-end 
mutual funds, they don't routinely sell new shares to investors at the current 
NAV (plus a load, if applicable), nor do they buy them back. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the number of shares in a closed-end fund stays more or less fixed and 
the prices of these shares fluctuate on the open market, like an individual 
stock or bond. This creates the possibility of a closed-end portfolio selling 
above or below its NAV -- at a premium or discount, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Closed-end funds number more than 250, with most trading on the New York or 
American stock exchanges. When shopping, examine a fund's dividend policy, 
management, expense ratio, performance and other factors. "But if you had to 
pick one variable . . . it would have to be the discount or premium," Herzfeld 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Barron's tracks discounts and premiums weekly, as does the Wall Street Journal 
on Mondays (stock funds) and Wednesdays (bond funds). Prices are listed daily 
in the stock tables of The Times and other newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
As noted, most closed-end portfolios tend to trade at discounts. This in itself 
doesn't guarantee a profit, because the markdown could widen or the value of 
the underlying holdings could drop. 
</P>
<P>
But if you buy a closed-end fund well below its NAV, you increase your chances 
for long-term success. "A wide discount provides some cushion," says Douglas 
Dent, editor of Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest, a newsletter based in Santa 
Barbara. Currently, closed-end bond and foreign stock funds appear to offer 
some of the better buys. Several fixed-income selections are selling at 
double-digit discounts, with yields in the 12% to 15% range, Dent says. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolios with large concentrations of junk bonds have fared especially poorly 
and thus could offer good returns if the market stabilizes. "The pure junk bond 
funds are totally out of favor. Some are selling at discounts of 40% to 50%, 
and their yields are as high as 25%," says Roger Wilson, president of Northwest 
Quadrant, a money management firm in Newport Beach. At such steep markdowns, 
several of these funds will probably prove to be good investments over the long 
haul, he says, even if some of their junk holdings default, which is probable. 
</P>
<P>
More appealing in Wilson's view are medium-quality portfolios that typically 
hold combinations of U.S. government bonds, foreign government bonds and junk. 
Some lately have traded at discounts as high as 20%, with yields of about 15%, 
he adds. 
</P>
<P>
If interest rates decline, that would push up the prices of good-quality bonds, 
although junk issues could stay depressed, at least until the economy 
strengthens. 
</P>
<P>
Money managers and researchers who follow closed-end funds believe that the 
market for these securities is relatively inefficient, which might explain why 
discounts sometimes widen so drastically. Individuals, not institutions, 
account for most of the buying and selling. As a result, many closed-end funds 
are less well-researched than, say, blue chip stocks or highly rated corporate 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Observers blame Wall Street, at least in part, for the current wide discounts 
on equity and bond funds. Brokers earn more selling closed-end investments as 
new issues rather than in the after-market and thus tend to neglect the 
securities after they come out, Dent says. In fact, the price of a new 
closed-end portfolio will generally drop by the amount that goes to brokers as 
compensation. For this reason, it's often wise to avoid the funds when they 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
Many closed-end selections, including the foreign stock portfolios, are managed 
by U.S. firms that also run regular, open-end mutual funds, often with a 
similar investment slant. This entails some interesting implications. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you find a closed-end selection managed by a company you like, 
you can buy the firm's expertise at a discount to what you might pay for a 
similar open-end fund. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, you can avoid the sales fee that many fund groups charge. 
Alliance, American Capital, Colonial, Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS), 
John Nuveen, Putnam, Templeton and Van Kampen Merritt are among the many load 
companies that also manage closed-end portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you must still pay a broker's commission when buying or selling a 
closed-end fund as you would on a stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to emphasize that even if you buy a fund at a discount, you 
won't necessarily make money. That discount can always widen, and the value of 
the underlying holdings can decline. Wilson expects to see lower prices -- and 
potentially better buys -- during the next several weeks as disheartened 
investors dump their closed-end funds to lock in tax losses before year-end. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some closed-end managers plan to convert their funds to 
open-end status, which would eliminate discounts. Sometimes the firm will 
voluntarily put the question up to a shareholder vote; in other cases a 
corporate raider may force the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Either managements on their own are taking what might be viewed as drastic 
measures to narrow the discounts, or shareholders are giving them a push," says 
Herzfeld, who adds that the number of conversions has increased this year as 
discounts have widened. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDS AT A DISCOUNT 
</P>
<P>
Closed-end portfolios offer the diversification and professional management of 
mutual funds, yet they trade like stocks, with prices determined by investors 
in the open market. At the moment, scores of closed-end funds are trading at 
substantial discounts to their "net asset value," or per-share worth of the 
underlying holdings. The following funds, all of which trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange, are among those favored by the advisers quoted in the 
accompanying column.

CHIP TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT THE MANUFACTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's long been an article of faith in the computer chip business that because 
the tiny slivers of silicon are so difficult to make efficiently, manufacturing 
technology is crucial to success. 
</P>
<P>
But that conventional wisdom is being challenged by the "fabless" chip 
companies, who maintain that manufacturing capability is now a commodity, and 
good design is what matters. 
</P>
<P>
Chip industry pundit Andrew Rappaport, president of Technology Research Group 
in Boston, likes to rile conference audiences by asserting that silicon is now 
effectively "free." So many circuits can now be engraved on a chip with 
relative ease, he says, that good design rather than good production technology 
is the key to good products. 
</P>
<P>
If that hypothesis is true, it portends a fundamental change in the structure 
of the chip business. The industry would divide into two types of companies: a 
small number of "foundries," mostly in Asia, that spend the $50 million to $500 
million needed for each "fab," and a plethora of chip-design firms that work 
closely with customers and use foundries for manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Asian company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has gone 
into business explicitly to make products for others. Other firms have actively 
pursued foundry work while also doing their own designs. 
</P>
<P>
But foundry arrangements work much better for some types of products than 
others. Chips &amp; Technologies, for example, designs chip sets for personal 
computers that are relatively unsophisticated from a manufacturing point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, fabless firms such as Xilinx, Lattice Semiconductor and 
Vitilec have products that do in fact require a leading-edge production 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"There are companies for whom the value-added is in the process, and there are 
companies whose products are primarily intellectual property, and are less 
dependent on the process," said George Alexy, vice president of marketing at 
Milpitas-based Cirrus Logic. 
</P>
<P>
Many simply do not buy the notion that the foundry function will ever be 
entirely split off from design and marketing. Hector Ruiz, senior vice 
president at Motorola's semiconductor unit, says the biggest chip companies are 
continuing to gain market share at the expense of smaller firms. The future, he 
says, is with companies that can design, market and manufacture their products.

SEWER FEE INCREASE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners and apartment dwellers could face an increase from $6 to $31.50 in 
their annual sewer service fees under a proposal before the City Council 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Business and industrial users would pay $55 a year under the proposal, up from 
$6 for businesses and $12 for industrial users. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed increases would go toward establishment of a fund to finance 
maintenance of the city's sewer system and repair and replacement of sewer 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Bradshaw, associate civil engineer for the city, said the proposed 
increases are in line with fees charged by neighboring cities. La Verne, for 
example, charges $66 a year per dwelling unit and Pomona, $60. Only Montclair's 
fee of $21.60 is lower, and that is being investigated as a result of 
Claremont's inquiries, Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's public hearing on the sewer fee increase was postponed until Nov. 15 
because it was at the end of a long meeting and only two people remained in the 
chambers.

LEAF BLOWER BAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to numerous complaints about noise and dust pollution, the City 
Council voted 4 to 1 to ban gasoline-powered leaf blowers as of Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the council agreed to permit the restricted use of electric and 
battery-operated blowers, which reportedly produce a less abrasive sound at a 
lower decibel level. 
</P>
<P>
They may be operated from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Algird Leiga voted against the ban, saying he was unsure that the 
benefits to the environment would offset the economic hardship for 
self-employed gardeners. Mayor Nicholas Presecan, calling the situation 
"no-win," said he voted for the ban with reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
The ban came after an hourlong public hearing during which most speakers 
opposed the blowers. The city, following a July recommendation from its 
Community Services Commission, prohibits all blowers on municipal property. 
Vacuums are used instead. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy Wright said the ban was necessary because professional 
gardeners and implement manufacturers had failed to police themselves.

Sunday, Oct. 28, you printed a letter to the editor titled "Party-Goer's Side

It's signed John Bernardi Jr. In my opinion, John Jr. is a big crybaby. In the 
article you printed (Times, Oct. 4), it said when the police tried to do their 
job he said wait till I tell my dad.

MODERN POLITICS, CALIFORNIA-STYLE: I MAY BE NEW AT THIS, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Greenbaum, Ron Greenbaum is a first-year law student at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the ripe old age of 22, I have joined the legions of voters who are 
apathetic about this election. My disillusionment stems from the sterility of 
modern politics. In their quest for election or reelection, politicians are 
telling us what they think we want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Our elected officials are afraid to make the difficult choices inherent in 
governing, because one unpopular decision of importance may lead to defeat in 
the next election. Because they play it safe, politicians have divorced 
themselves from their purpose: the responsibility of leading the people. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial race exemplifies modern politics, California-style. Although 
Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson may differ on some issues, the tenor of their 
campaigns is shockingly similar. Each has made a great effort to demonstrate 
that he or she is "tough, but caring" and the candidate for "change" -- 
apparently the current prerequisites for election. Both pledge to fight crime 
and drugs, provide more expansive health care, clean up the environment, 
support education and keep taxes low. 
</P>
<P>
All these objectives are commendable, but they are impossible to achieve 
simultaneously. It requires money to build new prisons, help the sick and 
injured, reduce smog-forming emissions and attract the best teachers. 
</P>
<P>
If we tripled our taxes, we might have enough money to fulfill all of these 
goals. But nobody wants that. As a result, the candidates have declined to 
state most of the specifics in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and Wilson know that any definitive statement of their vision will be 
attacked for either its limitations or exorbitant expense. They persist in 
describing a fantasy, rather than telling us the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of specificity in their campaigns, the candidates have left 
us with a difficult choice -- a more cynical observer might say no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Both were moderately successful mayors of large California cities. As a 
senator, Wilson has been described as the most anonymous figure in U.S. 
politics. It is unclear what he represents. Feinstein has a similar image 
problem. During the campaign both have labored much harder to label one another 
than to reveal themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The propositions demonstrate a related problem. The initiative process enables 
the Legislature to shift the burden for making difficult decisions from 
lawmakers to voters. We entrust the power of legislation to the Senate and the 
Assembly, and we pay them for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they require us to wade through 221 pages of material containing the 28 
propositions and the explanations. Few people, much less we first- or 
second-time voters, have the sophistication and patience to do so. Thus, some 
of our most important legislative choices hinge on which side creates better 
television advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the initiative process often leads to disastrous results. For 
example, the "environmental" initiatives might clog our courtrooms for years. 
If Proposition 128 ("Big Green") or Proposition 130 pass, opponents will 
challenge many of their provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, they conflict with Propositions 135 and 138. If all four initiatives 
pass, state judges may never resolve the mess. As a law student, I should be 
happy with the initiative process, because it virtually guarantees me and my 
classmates jobs when we graduate. But as a citizen, I am infuriated with the 
whole system. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the results of this election, the prospects for measurable 
constructive change appear dim. Neither gubernatorial candidate appears to 
possess the capacity necessary to tackle the tremendous concerns we will face 
for the rest of the decade. Similarly, the Legislature seems willing to pass 
the buck. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership does not require rhetoric as much as the ability to make the right 
decisions under trying circumstances. For the system to change, we must 
encourage people to enter office who will speak the whole truth and adopt an 
unpopular position when it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, I have been a volunteer adviser for the California 
YMCA Model Legislature/Court program. Each February, the program brings 1,000 
high-school students to Sacramento to debate bills in the Senate and Assembly 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
During the last conference, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown spoke to 
the student delegates. He delivered the usual inspirational speech, encouraging 
students to pursue careers in public service. One of his chief points was that 
our government needs fresh blood. He said most politicians have lost the 
capacity to deal with the tremendous problems facing California. He said the 
concern with reelection has become so consuming for most politicians that it 
has stifled their initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The sad thing, Mr. Speaker, is that you do not know how right you are.

FORGOTTEN CONSTITUENCIES HOLD THE FUTURE OF THE STATE; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: IN THE FUTURE, UNLIKE TODAY, NO ONE WILL BE ELECTED GOVERNOR WHO 
HAS IGNORED THE CONCERNS OF NEARLY HALF THE STATE'S PEOPLE.

Last month I had a troubling encounter with gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson 
at a breakfast meeting in Los Angeles. The meeting was designed to provide 
local Latino leaders an opportunity to discuss key issues with an individual 
who could be our next governor, and I welcomed the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the Civil Rights Act of 1990 and his opposition to the 
legislation, I pleaded with Wilson to urge President Bush to sign the bill. I 
also asked Wilson to vote to override a veto, if necessary. The fact that he 
refused to change his position on the legislation didn't disturb me as much as 
his intentions to use his stand on the bill to distort the issues and divide 
the people of this great state. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's assertion that the bill would promote quotas, mediocrity and 
opportunities for undeserving individuals indicated to me that he did not 
recognize or understand the effects of employment discrimination on minority 
communities. His further response indicated a lack of knowledge, awareness and 
interest about the specific concerns of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
This negative, divisive and one-sided approach to campaigning has been typical 
throughout the governor's race. Candidate Dianne Feinstein hasn't fared any 
better. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor's early attempts at showing sensitivity to the 
changing demographics began when she said she would appoint women and 
minorities to key positions in her administration. As a woman of color, I was 
heartened to see she would seek out talented, resourceful individuals to create 
a government that included representatives from my community. 
</P>
<P>
She quickly did an about-face, however, when she realized that Wilson was going 
to use this issue to divide rather than unite constituents. Token or sporadic 
attention to the needs and concerns of minorities is no longer acceptable, and 
this lack of commitment in addressing the real issues of this state has many of 
us worried. 
</P>
<P>
Neither candidate has displayed the visionary leadership necessary to 
successfully address the complex and difficult issues facing the multicultural, 
multiracial population of this state. Neither candidate has demonstrated that 
he or she even realizes the population of the state has taken on a different 
hue. Neither candidate is instilling confidence in those who would be governed 
-- specifically the minority communities -- that he or she is worthy of their 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The changing demographics in this state tell part of the story. The latest 
census figures show the population of California numbers just under 30 million. 
Of this figure, 42% are ethnic minorities. With growth rates for Latinos and 
Asians expected to remain at similar or increased levels, those percentages 
will grow even more during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Our next governor must establish a new form of governance that will include and 
involve all the people of the state. In the future, candidates won't get 
elected by running campaigns of exclusion and 30-second commercials while 
ignoring the voices and neglecting the concerns of the other half of this 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial candidates have failed to address the issues of relevance to 
Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans. There are many of these issues, 
among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Providing more money for schools, improving the course of study, hiring 
well-qualified teachers and holding on to them once they are hired. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Addressing the questions of unemployment and underemployment of minorities 
and lack of economic development programs in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ending the exclusion of minorities from the state's political processes and 
increasing the effectiveness of their representation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Easing tensions between the various ethnic and racial groups competing for 
the same slice of the limited pie. 
</P>
<P>
But this feeling that no one cares is not unique to minority voters. Today, the 
general voting public feels frustrated and disillusioned with its 
representatives. People are hurling unprecedented levels of criticism at 
politicians for what they haven't done or what they've done wrong. Some voters 
are threatening to "throw the bums out." Others think they'll get their message 
across by not voting at all. 
</P>
<P>
This frustration is understandable for those who feel they have no say in their 
government. But think for a moment how individuals feel when they've been 
unrepresented not for just a few years, but for many decades. They know that no 
matter how often they vote for the individual they think will best represent 
their communities, their candidate will never win. They simply do not have the 
numbers or support of their neighbors. This has been the dichotomy of minority 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, minorities have received mixed messages with regard to their 
participation in politics. They are told to participate, yet a history of 
voting discrimination, English-literacy requirements, at-large elections and 
gerrymandered districts has contributed to the disenfranchisement of minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities are told that if they cast their vote, they can elect a candidate of 
their choice. They are told they must participate if they are going to make a 
difference in how their state and cities are run. But what minority voters have 
seen are elected officials working to protect their incumbencies and special 
interests, officials who have forgotten the minority and low-income voter. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in many minority communities statewide, there is a sense of loss and 
neglect, of broken promises and unfulfilled dreams. These individuals do not 
believe in governance; they are unable to see any solutions to their problems, 
or to understand that they must be part of any remedy. They become further and 
further disenfranchised until they no longer relate to or associate with the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
This election provides an example of how bad things have become. The candidates 
have engaged in negative campaigning, flinging distortions at each other and 
neglecting the real issues of concern to voters. They should have been 
embracing all communities within the social, economic and political fabric of 
our society. 
</P>
<P>
Various groups will jockey for political power and influence during the coming 
redistricting. In the past, Latino and other minority groups did not have the 
sophistication to be key players in this process of negotiation -- but that is 
no longer the case. Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans have begun 
to develop an exciting brand of coalition politics that will forever change the 
way we elect our representatives. This coalition must be part of the political 
scene of the future. 
</P>
<P>
These circumstances are sobering, and I maintain a deep sense of hope that we 
can and will overcome this most serious challenge. But for the moment, the 
problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
How will we educate the 5.4 million school children where one in six are 
immigrants, and one in four come from homes in which a language other than 
English is spoken? How can we ensure that the work force of tomorrow, composed, 
to a great extent, of minorities, is up to the challenges it must face? How are 
we going to ensure that we make ours an inclusive government -- one that 
operates by consensus rather than division? 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, we the voters will not have clear choices, and our first instinct 
could be not to vote. Ignore that instinct, and vote for the individual you 
think will best represent all the people of this state. Once that new governor 
is in office, we must demand the kind of leadership the citizens of this state 
deserve and, indeed, depend upon for a stable and productive future.

THE ULTIMATE GOLDEN OLDIE: A CITIZEN-LEGISLATURE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IN CALIFORNIA'S FORMATIVE YEARS, LEGISLATORS WORKED PART TIME AND 
WEREN'T PAID MUCH. ENTER THE REAL LAW-MAKING POWERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since classical antiquity, lovers of republican government have been charmed by 
the notion of the citizen-politician -- especially the citizen- legislator. 
Propositions 131 and 140, the term-limitation initiatives, promise to return us 
to those golden political days. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, there is little doubt that most Americans prefer 
legislatures that look like themselves. Andrew Jackson probably spoke -- and 
speaks -- for Americans when, in his first message to Congress in 1829, he 
said: "The duties of all public officers are . . . so plain and simple that men 
of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance; and I 
cannot but believe that more is lost by the long continuance of men in office 
than is generally to be gained by their experience." Turnover of politicians, 
he added, "constitutes a leading principle in the republican creed." 
</P>
<P>
So it has largely gone for state legislatures. Some states paid their 
legislators nothing, picking up their expenses only when the law-makers were in 
session, typically a few weeks. Staff was minuscule, quarters cramped. Some 
state legislatures convened a general session every other year, others a 
"budget-only" session. A man could get rich serving in a state legislature, but 
not honestly. 
</P>
<P>
From its first session, in 1849, until recently, the California Legislature 
conformed to this general pattern. In fact, the modern, professionalized state 
Legislature was born in California in the 1960s, fathered by Jess Unruh of 
Inglewood. Before 1966, the state was "blessed" by citizen-legislators, even 
though they seldom lost elections. 
</P>
<P>
That first California Legislature met in San Jose. Miners predominated. There 
was plenty of confusion and much uncertainty during sessions. Legislating was 
hard work, and the men frequently adjourned during the day to a saloon across 
the road. The session is immortalized in California history books as "The 
Legislature of a Thousand Drinks." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the legislators got quite a bit accomplished. They chose a governor 
and decided on Sacramento as the state's permanent capital. The presence of 
several veterans of state politics "back east" probably helped to facilitate 
the session's productivity. The slavery controversy was also raging in the 
country and it gave a structure to the politics of even far-off California. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Californians back in those Gold Rush days were not charmed by the 
quality of their citizen-Legislature. John Caughey, the foremost historian of 
the Gold Rush, reports that one San Francisco newspaperman characterized the 
Legislature, in 1851, as an "infamous, ignorant, drunken, rowdy, perjured and 
traitorous body of men." At that, the citizen-legislators were probably not a 
lot different from a random sample of their male constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three decades later, manners in Sacramento improved. But the moral tone 
was, if anything, worse. In the aftermath of the Civil War and in the age of 
the Robber Barons, the Republican Party overshadowed its Democratic counterpart 
well into the 20th Century. But that really didn't matter between 1879 and 
1910, when there existed an "invisible third party in California -- the 
Southern Pacific Company." 
</P>
<P>
The railroad didn't completely control all government in the state. But it was 
the dominant political force. It was easy. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, California was a state of incredibly diverse politics, blessed or 
cursed with a multiplicity of interest groups and weak, poorly led political 
parties. Southern Pacific's technique was to dominate the Republican Party's 
nominating conventions and buy itself enough legislators of both parties to 
enable it to broker most coalitions. On any issue touching its interests, the 
railroad was invincible. The legislators were part-time politicians, with only 
nominal salaries, little or no staff, no powerful party to back them up and 
manage their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the first decade of the 20th Century, the situation had become scandalous. 
Abraham Ruef, the subtly corrupt and intelligent Republican "boss" of San 
Francisco, was in the railroad's pocket. Writes Kevin Starr: "(In 1907), Abe 
Ruef, his coat pockets bristling with sheaves of legislation he wanted passed, 
took to the floor of the Senate and the Assembly, although he was not an 
elected member of either body, sitting here and there next to a legislator for 
a moment of kibbitzing and quiet smiles." 
</P>
<P>
A photograph of Ruef taken at the Republican convention at Santa Cruz in 1906 
showed him lolling familiarly with the entire Republican hierarchy, including 
the party's candidate for governor, whose nomination Ruef had just brokered. 
The photo created a sensation. It was soon dubbed "The Shame of California," 
and it popped up on billboards all over the state. It was a powerful stimulus 
to reformers seeking to break the power of "The Octopus" -- Southern Pacific -- 
over California's government. 
</P>
<P>
The reformers, led by the vain, ambitious and ever-choleric Hiram P. Johnson, 
in the North, and a mixed bag of clerics, lawyers and newspaper editors, in the 
South, seized control of the Republican Party from the railroad in 1910, and 
elected Johnson as governor. The "Progressives" dominated both major parties 
and both houses of the Legislature for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
They left a great legacy: the direct primary; the initiative, referendum and 
recall; nonpartisanship in local elections, and a party system even weaker than 
its predecessor. The Republicans were still dominant, however. 
</P>
<P>
Progressives also idealized the citizen-legislator. By weakening the political 
parties, they thought, "the boss" as a type would be destroyed. Progressives 
wanted as little as possible mediation between voter and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the charismatic Johnson reigned, Progressivism worked. But its 
agenda had been a limited one. With Johnson off in the U.S. Senate, the 
Democrats shattered after 1920 and the hold of the Southern Pacific broken, 
legislating in California was soon dominated by what came to be called "The 
Third House." That was the mocking sobriquet given to the collective body of 
lobbyists who swarmed, as ever, in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Progressive legacy of diminished political parties, combined with the 
tradition of a part-time Legislature and myriad private interest groups, left a 
vacuum at the center of state government. The Third House helped to fill it, 
but even it needed a cohesive force that could manage governmental business. By 
the 1930s, that force had emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Samish -- "Artie," as he was called -- shrewdly built up a roster of 
clients from the rich bed of interest groups and associations in Sacramento. He 
knew the rules of the Legislature better than anyone else. By helping out with 
nominating and election campaigns, he also developed a loyal corps of 
legislators, enough to give him the balance of power on most issues. Operating 
out of his office in the Hotel Senator, across the street from the Capitol 
itself, Samish became informally the boss of the Legislature. He was the "guy 
you had to see." He liked to call himself "the man who gets things done." 
</P>
<P>
Able and cynical, Samish bossed the people's representatives. "I am the 
governor of the Legislature. To hell with the governor of the state," he could 
boast in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters if the Samish boast had substance, then-Gov. Earl Warren 
replied: "On matters that affect his clients, Artie unquestionably has more 
power than the governor." In some ways, it was a new "shame of California." 
</P>
<P>
Unruh sought to change all that -- to curb the power of the Third House and 
restore responsibility to the law-making process -- when he became Speaker of 
the Assembly in the early 1960s. More than anyone else, he was responsible for 
the creation of the professionalized Legislature. He vastly expanded the power 
of the speakership to enable the office to take over the brokering role Samish 
had performed. Professional-scale salaries were introduced. Each member was 
provided a professional staff, and the number of committee consultants 
increased. Even the political parties got staff assistance to enable them to 
play more of a role in the process. 
</P>
<P>
California's professionalized Legislature was a clear improvement. For a time, 
it was considered the best in the nation; other states sought to imitate it. 
The Third House was by no means eliminated, but it certainly was no longer 
dominant. Unruh's reforms worked. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, things have slipped in the last decade. But there are no Artie 
Samishes, no Abraham Ruefs, no Southern Pacifics.

ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
Note: The Times does not ordinarily endorse in the contest for governor because 
this race attracts sufficient attention to enable voters to reach informed 
decisions, and it chooses not to endorse in every political race but to endorse 
in partisan elections selectively. 
</P>
<P>
State Offices 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Governor: Leo McCarthy (D) 
</P>
<P>
A hard-working problem solver. Quiet, persistent, decent and level-headed. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney General: Arlo Smith (D) 
</P>
<P>
A career prosecutor -- non-ideological, professional. His opponent is a former 
congressman whose conservative political views may get in the way of an 
evenhanded approach to this important job. 
</P>
<P>
State Treasurer: Kathleen Brown (D) 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, Tom Hayes, has done a good job as the incumbent treasurer, but 
Brown offers a vision of the office that's both imaginative and responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State: March Fong Eu (D) 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable career public servant with a very capable staff. 
</P>
<P>
Controller: Gray Davis (D) 
</P>
<P>
Well-qualified to continue to watchdog the state's $55.7 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner: Wes Bannister (R) 
</P>
<P>
Independent insurance agent Bannister, who has agreed to put his agency into a 
blind trust if elected, offers impressive knowledge of the industry and ability 
to critically evaluate its weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
State Board of Equalization 2: Brad Sherman (D) 
</P>
<P>
Brad Sherman, a tax lawyer and a certified public accountant, would bring a 
high level of professionalism, vigor and integrity to the board. 
</P>
<P>
State Board of Equalization 4: No endorsement 
</P>
<P>
The race for this seat is between Paul Carpenter, a man who cannot serve 
because he is a convicted felon, and Joseph H. Adams, who does not have the 
broader background needed to exercise the duties effectively. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress 
</P>
<P>
30th District.: Reuben Franco (R-Monterey Park) 
</P>
<P>
Young, aggressive challenger in a district represented by a low-energy 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
36th District: George E. Brown Jr.(D-Colton) 
</P>
<P>
Top science and technology booster, important at this critical juncture; in a 
stiff challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 
</P>
<P>
124 -- YES: Hospital Districts, Constitutional Amendment 
</P>
<P>
Community-owned hospitals, especially in rural areas, need freedom to use 
innovative and economical ways to broaden their services. Would authorize local 
hospital districts to acquire stock -- currently prohibited by the state 
Constitution -- in corporations engaging in health-care-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
125 -- YES: Rail Transit Funding, Constitutional Amendment 
</P>
<P>
Right now using state gasoline tax revenues to buy commuter rail cars and 
equipment is constitutionally prohibited. This unnecessary encumbrance would be 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
126 -- NO: Alcoholic Beverages Tax, Constitutional Amendment 
</P>
<P>
This poison pill to the "Nickel a drink" proposition (134) would hike liquor 
taxes somewhat, but the taxes collected would simply be dumped into the general 
fund, and two clauses designed to neutralize 134 and other liquor taxes are 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
127 -- YES: Earthquake Property Tax Exclusion, Constitutional Amendment 
</P>
<P>
Would exclude existing buildings that are retrofitted with earthquake 
improvements from property tax increases. A sensible change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
128 -- NO: Environment, Public Health Initiative (Big Green) 
</P>
<P>
This grab bag of a ballot measure would in some areas aim to do a lot and in 
others not do very much. It proposes, among other things, to ban pesticides; 
require the state to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as 40% by the 
year 2010; ban clear-cutting of ancient redwood forests; accelerate the 
timetable for eliminating use of ozone-depleting chemicals; write into state 
law an existing ban on new offshore oil drilling in state waters; tax oil 
companies to pay for future offshore oil spills; curb discharge of toxic waste 
into bay and coastal waters; create the post of environmental advocate to 
enforce environmental laws. It all sounds pretty good, but on closer 
examination it duplicates a lot of what's being done and adds some things that 
might be more symbolic than real. More wish list than effective environmental 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
129 -- NO: Drug Enforcement, Prevention, Treatment, Prison Initiative 
</P>
<P>
This is a political leftover from the June primary -- a relic of Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp's unsuccessful run for governor. Proposition 115, passed in 
June, covers a lot of this. What's not covered, by and large, is better handled 
in Proposition 133 or better left alone. 
</P>
<P>
130 -- YES: Forest Acquisition Initiative (Forests Forever) 
</P>
<P>
By far the best environmental proposition on the ballot. Would ban 
clear-cutting in all forests; authorize a $742-million bond issue for the 
purchase of redwood forests; prohibit timber operators from harvesting more 
trees than could be grown on their land in any 10-year period; restrict burning 
of debris from logging; restrict export of California logs; reconstitute the 
state Board of Forestry and require appointment of environmentalists. Go for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
131 -- YES: Term Limits, Ethics, Campaign Financing Initiative 
</P>
<P>
This is the thinking person's term-limit measure. It doesn't have the 
cannibalistic appeal of 140, but it might very well enhance the quality of 
state government and electoral politics. Would limit terms to 12 years for 
state Senate, Assembly and State Board of Equalization members, eight years for 
governor and other statewide officers; officeholders reaching the limits could 
run again for the same seat after sitting out at least one term. Would set up 
partial public financing of campaigns by creating a taxpayer-supported fund 
that would provide $3 for every $1 a candidate collected from contributors 
residing in the candidate's district; would ban off-year fund-raising and place 
limits on contributions and expenditures; a new special prosecutor's office 
would pursue political corruption. A good deal all around. 
</P>
<P>
132 -- NO: Marine Resources Initiative 
</P>
<P>
Do we need to graft onto the state Constitution a ban on gill and trammel nets? 
Good cause, wrong remedy; go back to the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
133 -- YES: Drug Enforcement and Prevention Initiative 
</P>
<P>
Would, through an increase in the sales tax by 1/2 cent, put badly needed money 
where it desperately needs to go. Creates a $7.5-billion fund for drug 
enforcement, treatment and education programs over over a four-year period. 
Also would prohibit the early release of criminals convicted twice of murder, 
manslaughter, rape or drug offenses. Thinking person's crime measure. 
</P>
<P>
134 -- NO: Alcohol Surtax Initiative (Nickel-a-Drink) 
</P>
<P>
The stiff rise in alcohol taxes that's proposed -- from $2 to $8.40 on a gallon 
of hard liquor -- would go to an earmarked array of drug and alcohol treatment 
and prevention programs and law enforcement. Seems like a good idea, but it 
freezes parts of the state budget in an inflexible way and dumps a new state 
tax on top of federal alcohol taxes that are due to go up again. To be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
135 -- NO: Pesticide Regulation Initiative 
</P>
<P>
The agribusiness massive counterattack on Big Green. Seeks to invalidate the 
pesticide provisions of Proposition 128 and adds nothing to the assault on 
pesticides except dumping new spending requirements on taxpayers. A hoax. 
</P>
<P>
136 -- NO: State and Local Taxation Initiative 
</P>
<P>
A mess that would allow a minority to muck up effective government. It would, 
among other things, require a favorable vote by two-thirds of the electorate 
(instead of a simple majority, as currently required) to pass a special local 
tax, or a tax increase by initiative, and contains a "ballot virus" provision 
that could nullify votes on some other measures on the ballot. Would require 
cities with charters, such as Los Angeles, to get a majority vote on any new 
general tax increases. All those who believe in rule by majority, vote no. 
</P>
<P>
137 -- NO: Initiative and Referendum Process Initiative 
</P>
<P>
Would require that any proposal, no matter how technical or minor, to revise 
the initiative or referendum process be submitted to the voters for their 
approval. Unnecessary, absurd. 
</P>
<P>
138 -- NO: Forestry Programs, Timber Harvesting Practices Initiative 
</P>
<P>
The counter to tough, excellent 130: Proposes a ban on clear-cutting in ancient 
redwood forests that's weak and would restrict state purchase of redwood 
forests by requiring approval of the landowner. Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
139 -- NO: Prison Inmate Labor Tax Credit 
</P>
<P>
Would repeal the constitutional prohibition against use of convict labor by 
private employers and authorize businesses to contract with state prison and 
county jail administrators for an inmate work force. Sounds good, but a million 
pitfalls, and it's bad penology. 
</P>
<P>
140 -- NO: Term Limits, Legislators' Retirement, Legislators' Operating Costs 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically supported by many longtime incumbents, this is the neutron-bomb 
approach to political reform. Would impose unreasonable lifetime term limits 
for legislators and most other state-elected officials (for instance, Assembly 
members could serve only six years, state Senators eight). The state-run 
retirement system for legislators would be eliminated, and the Legislature's 
operating budget would be cut by about 38%. Competes with the better term-limit 
measure 131. 
</P>
<P>
141 -- YES: Toxic Chemicals Discharge. Public Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Would extend to most government agencies the provisions of Proposition 65, the 
1986 anti-toxics initiative that applies to businesses. And they would be 
required to issue a warning if they expose the public to such chemicals. Close 
a bad loophole. 
</P>
<P>
142 -- YES: Veterans' Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
Would authorize a self-financing $400 million bond issue to finance the Cal-Vet 
program of home and farm purchases by veterans. Good cause. 
</P>
<P>
143 -- YES: Higher Education Facilities Bond Act of November 1990 
</P>
<P>
$450 million for public colleges and universities to use to construct new 
buildings on existing campuses and renovate buildings and equipment. Arrest the 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
144 -- NO: New Prison Construction Bond Act of 1990-B 
</P>
<P>
Would allow the state to borrow $450 million to continue expansion and 
renovation of the state prison system. There's a lot of state prison funding 
already in the pipeline. Enough for now. 
</P>
<P>
145 -- YES: California Housing Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
Would authorize $315 million in bonds to provide first-time home buyers with 
low-interest loans, and housing assistance for elderly tenants, poor families, 
homeless men and women and farm-workers. Thousands of Californians would 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
146 -- YES: School Facilities Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$800 million in additional elementary and secondary classrooms, and renovation, 
at stake here; average class size at stake, too. Good one. 
</P>
<P>
147 -- YES: County Correctional and Juvenile Facility Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$225 million to construct, remodel and replace county jails and juvenile 
facilities in counties that meet certain planning standards and are prepared to 
pick up 25% of the costs. Much needed. 
</P>
<P>
148 -- YES: Water Resources Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$380 million for various water projects including water storage, drought 
assistance projects, an international waste-water treatment plant and flood 
control (it would fund one such notable project in Orange County). Unavoidable 
and overdue. 
</P>
<P>
149 -- YES: California Park, Recreation and Wildlife Enhancement Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$437 million in bonds to acquire, develop and restore parks, beaches and other 
recreational areas throughout the state; would also pay for building or 
improving forest fire stations, museums and zoos. A big space-maker -- and 
improver. 
</P>
<P>
150 -- YES: County Courthouse Facility Capital Expenditure Bond Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$200 million in bonds to provide money for construction and remodeling of 
county courthouse facilities. An anti-court-gridlock measure. 
</P>
<P>
151 -- YES: Child Care Facilities Financing Act of 1990 
</P>
<P>
$30-million bond issue to build or refurbish child-care facilities, provide 
loans to state and local government agencies and to nonsectarian organizations 
that provide child care; would set up a Child Care Facilities Authority. A good 
start. 
</P>

LOS ANGELES COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
County Offices 
</P>
<P>
County Assessor: Kenneth P. Hahn 
</P>
<P>
Hahn has the competence, experience and temperament to reinvigorate an agency 
troubled by administrative inefficiency and low morale.

Santa Monica Municipal Court Office No. 3:

<P>
David B. Finkel 
</P>
<P>
David Finkel's record of community service and his tough-minded but 
compassionate approach makes him the best choice. 
</P>
<P>
Measures 
</P>
<P>
A -- NO: 1/2 Cent Sales Tax for Prisons 
</P>
<P>
Would raise the county sales tax 1/2 cent in Los Angeles County for 
construction of county jails and juvenile facilities. Well-intentioned, but the 
solution it proposes (mainly a program of jail construction), the method it 
would use to finance it (an increase in the sales tax) and the huge discretion 
it gives to the appointed controlling agency is worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
B -- YES: Park Bonds 
</P>
<P>
This largest bond issue in county history would boost property taxes $10 a year 
on average for the next 20 years to raise $816 million for more than 75 
recreational and cultural projects. Without these improvements, quality of life 
will decline. Must pass by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
C -- YES: 1/2 Cent Sales Tax for Transit 
</P>
<P>
For new mass transit projects -- and to replace federal funds that once could 
be relied on to pay for major transportation projects. Will help get this 
county moving again. 
</P>
<P>
CITY OF LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
Measures 
</P>
<P>
J -- YES: Bonds for Police Communications/911 Improvements 
</P>
<P>
Special property tax to finance a $235-million bond issue to improve the city's 
severely overburdened 911 network. For the cost to the average homeowner of $14 
a year over the 20-year life of the tax, a worthy investment. Must pass by 
two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
K -- YES: Bonds to Preserve Affordable Housing, Loans to Low-Income, First-Time 
Home Buyers and Homeless Shelters. 
</P>
<P>
$100 million to preserve affordable housing by providing low-interest loans to 
nonprofit developers to finance the purchase and reinforcement of seismically 
unsafe apartment buildings; would also fund homeless shelters and help 
first-time home buyers. Must pass by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
L -- YES: Anti-Apartheid Contracting Policy 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles now bars some city contracts with firms that do business in South 
Africa. This would amend the charter to expand the ban on contracts with firms 
that do business with South Africa. Send a message. 
</P>
<P>
M -- YES: Civilian Pension Benefits 
</P>
<P>
A pension simplification measure. New federal and state laws make the city's 
current technical requirements moot. Sensible. 
</P>
<P>
N -- YES: City Election Recount Procedures 
</P>
<P>
Would change the law so that the results of a general election can be 
challenged via a procedure that obviates the need to file a lawsuit. Sensible. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
72nd District: Tom Umberg (D) 
</P>

</P>
<P>
County Measures 
</P>
<P>
M -- YES: 1/2 Cent Sales Tax for Transportation 
</P>
<P>
Failure to pass Measure M in Orange County would boomerang on the voters, 
dooming them to endure an inadequate transportation system that could be vastly 
improved with passage. More than $400 million in matching funds awaits the 
county by the turn of the century if it will approve the 1/2 cent sales tax 
measure. Go for it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
A-preserve-the-shoreline measure.

<P>
W -- NO: Costa Mesa -- Permits Fireworks Sale and Use 
</P>
<P>
Advisory measure; send a message to the City Council to ban all fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Z -- YES: Fullerton -- Bans Fireworks Sale and Use

Most county cities now ban all fireworks; Fullerton should, too.

75th District: Deirdre Alpert (D)

A -- YES: Citizens Review Board for Law Enforcement (County)

<P>
County needs an independent body to investigate complaints of misconduct by 
law-enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
B -- YES: Creation of a Department of Corrections (County) 
</P>
<P>
Passage would authorize county supervisors to remove jails from Sheriff's 
control and create a separate Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
C -- YES: Pound Animal Research (County) 
</P>
<P>
Public should support continued provision of pound animals for research. 
Measure is advisory only. 
</P>
<P>
D -- NO: Growth Management (County) 
</P>
<P>
Builder-sponsored initiative exempts much development from controls and caps 
fees for road construction at an inadequate level. Deceptive.

<P>
$100 million bond for purchase of open space and parkland is crucial to 
preserving city's character.

<P>
According to my sample ballot, Prop. 130 wins the prize for the highest cost 
bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The total is $1,327,000,000! 
</P>
<P>
For the $1.3 billion, Prop. 130 proposes to buy 3,000 acres of something called 
the "Headwaters Forest." It would be outrageous to allow Earth First! (one of 
the sponsors of Prop. 130) to siphon off this many taxpayer dollars for its 
selfish purposes when there are so many unmet needs in our society.

I have read "let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater" a great number of 
times in regard to Prop. 140. 
</P>
<P>
My response to this is "we can make more babies." After the limited number of 
years as a "lawmaker," the legislator would have the simple choice of either 
running for higher office or returning to the private sector and living under 
the laws he created. Think about it.

elected officials are allowed to serve. Also, according to the polls, most 
voters will be reelecting the incumbents to office. What hypocrisy!

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial of Oct. 9 ("Conservation at Its Very Best") was mislabeled. It 
should have read "Preservation at Its Very Worst." 
</P>
<P>
Your shallowly reasoned attempt to justify passage of Prop. 130 -- the Forest 
Protection Bond Act -- might well have been written by Earth First! radicals, 
who you must be aware are the primary supporters of this ill-conceived 
intrusion into forest management on private property. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every facet of Prop. 130 is based on emotional rhetoric and conveniently 
ignores the fact that California now has the toughest set of timber regulations 
in the nation. Without passage of Prop. 130 and its counterpart, Prop. 138, 
private individuals and industry are required to restock their lands with new 
trees immediately after harvesting, along with a myriad of other environmental 
protection rules and regulations that are legally mandated by the California 
Forest Practice Act. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 130, and to a certain extent Prop. 138, would take the harvesting process 
out of the hands of foresters and biologists and put it in the hands of 
politicians and bureaucratic appointees. And, as was so blatantly glossed over 
in your editorial, Prop. 130 will result in a 68% reduction in harvesting and 
cost up to 75,000 people their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As a practicing professional forester who is intimately familiar with the 
ecology of the coast redwood, it is abhorrent to me the drivel that is fed to 
our urban population. Ironically, many of them undoubtedly read your editorial 
while lounging on their redwood deck chairs on their redwood decks, attached to 
their redwood house, all the while blithely unsuspecting the direct connection 
to their lifestyle.

ALCOHOL TAXES: PROPS. 126, 134 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the liquor industry continues to spend millions on an ad campaign to 
defeat Prop. 134, I grow more and more apprehensive. I refer to your article 
concerning the current preparations by Los Angeles County officials to close 
four more clinics serving more than 4,000 mentally ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
I am continually frustrated and angry at the blatant disregard for our county's 
seriously mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
My oldest daughter has been mentally ill since she was 16. I cannot adequately 
describe in this space what serious mental illness does to the victim of this 
brain disease. Any disease that attacks one in the prime of youth is sad; one 
that arrests capacity for productivity and basic functioning and relegates one 
to a stigmatized life of misunderstanding and confusion is tragic. One of the 
very few programs available to my daughter is one offered at a community mental 
health center. Now, once again, after closing 10 in the last two years, more 
are threatened to close. 
</P>
<P>
Community programs can make a difference. They help people gain confidence and 
learn independent living skills. With well-developed programs, some people 
recover substantially, hold a job and achieve a satisfactory life. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has cut $61 million from the mental-health budget this fiscal 
year. The system is in dire need of funding to hold off a complete collapse. 
And don't forget the other trick, Prop. 136, the so-called taxpayers "right to 
vote." If it passes, it nullifies Prop. 134 because it calls for an almost 
impossible two-thirds vote to increase any state or local taxes. We need a no 
in 136 and a yes on 134.

CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS FILL OUT THEIR BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Alturas to El Centro, California newspapers in the last few weeks have 
offered advice on Nov. 6 candidates and ballot issues. The Times surveyed 31 
publications up and down the state for a sampling of editorial recommendations. 
In the race for governor, 14 had endorsed Republican Pete Wilson and 10 backed 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein, as of Friday. On the ballot initiatives, there was 
consensus on some issues: Only three papers, for example, recommended a "yes" 
vote on Proposition 128, "Big Green." Most said no to legislative term limits 
-- only eight were for Proposition 131, with seven affirmative on Proposition 
140. And there were only three "yes" recommendations on Proposition 136, a 
taxation measure with a "ballot virus" that could nullify votes on at least 
three other measures. In the tally below, initiatives are grouped by topic: 
Propositions 126 and 134 concern alcohol taxation; 128, 130, 135 and 138 are 
environmental measures -- 128 and 130 are backed by environmentalists, while 
135 and 138 are industry-backed pesticide and forestry measures; 131 and 140 
would both impose term limits; 136 would make it harder to pass new taxes; 137 
would require that changes in the initiative process be put to a vote of the 
people. For details on all 28 propositions, see chart on Pages M4-M5.

What has four wheels, goes really fast, and leaves behind a trail of I suds? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, nothing. But soap box racers probably come closest to that 
description. See for yourself with Nickelodeon's Special Delivery: The All 
American Soap Box Derby, in which contestants ages 11 to 17 gather in Akron, 
Ohio, to race for scholarships and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
This year's winner was Sami Jones of Salem, Ore., with Danny Groth of Flint, 
Mich. taking second. 
</P>
<P>
The high-speed sports spectacular was taped Aug. 11-13 and shows that even 
though soap-box derbies have been going on from time immemorial, the sport is 
far from being all washed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Special Delivery: The All American Soap Box Derby" Sunday at 3 p.m., 
Nickelodeon. For all ages.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: MUSICIAN SEGUES FROM ROCK TO RAYMOND CHANDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's played music with a Go-Go and a Rolling Stone, but Jesse Sublett is making 
his reputation in the land of literature. 
</P>
<P>
His second mystery novel, "Tough Baby," published by Viking, hit bookstores in 
October, following last year's critically acclaimed debut effort, "Rock Critic 
Murders." Each spotlights Martin Fender, a musician, who, like Sublett, mixes 
careers. Fender also works for a collection agency. He reminds Sublett of the 
bizarre characters he encounters in his frequent trips as a bass player on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians are very similar to crime detectives," said Sublett, 36, of North 
Hollywood. "These are people who are too weird to do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Sublett puts himself in that category. After years of playing music in Texas -- 
he formed the Skunks rock group -- he moved to Los Angeles in 1987 because 
"that's where Raymond Chandler lived." He joined a group led by Go-Go Kathy 
Valentine and wrote songs. And he soon discovered that his passion for writing, 
always secondary to his musical pursuits, could be more than a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was a kid, I loved writing," he said, "and I soon realized it was a 
viable thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Critic Murders" was nominated for the Private Eye Writers of America's 
Shamus Award, and Viking printed 12,000 copies of "Tough Baby." He is busy 
working on a third mystery novel, "Boiled in Concrete," due in August. He has 
written two screenplays -- one has been optioned -- and hopes to write 
mysteries that don't relate to the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sublett hasn't abandoned his musical career. Later this month, Demon 
Records is scheduled to release a live album by the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor 
Band recorded at the Roxy in March. Taylor used to be a Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett plays bass on the record. His song, "Who Put the Sting on the Honey 
Bee," appears on the album and in "Tough Baby." 
</P>
<P>
The careers sometimes mix in strange ways. "I was talking to Mick Taylor and he 
told me he thinks Chandler is the best too. I almost passed out." 
</P>
<P>
Sasch in Studio City has introduced a new weekly special on Sunday nights -- 
Alternative Music Night. Instead of the standard fare of rock-and-roll and Top 
40 presented all week, the club, according to manager Mark Yandle, was looking 
for a night to showcase New Wave/alternative performers. 
</P>
<P>
"For months, we've known we wanted to be more than a rock-and-roll club," 
Yandle said. "And the response to our first night was incredible. People loved 
hearing the original music." 
</P>
<P>
When the concept debuted Oct. 21, a disc jockey played alternative records. In 
the future, Yandle said, the club will present live performers offering all 
kinds of music, including reggae and original dance material. All shows begin 
at 9 p.m.; the club's cover charge is $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Barn Dance will have a tribute Tuesday to Gram Parsons at the Palomino in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, who died of a drug overdose in 1973, would have been 44 next week. 
Ronnie Mack, Barn Dance's host, credits Parsons with being a pioneer in country 
rock. Parsons sang and played guitar, and his songs include "Sin City" and 
"Devil in Disguise." Among the performers scheduled are Rosie Flores, James 
Intveld, Dale Watson and Lucinda Williams. Barn Dance held a similar tribute 
for Parsons last year.

THE GETTY PUTS THE FUN AND EXCITEMENT BACK INTO A MUSEUM VISIT THROUGH ITS 
FAMILY CIRCLE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

For kids, art museums can be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
Walking around quiet, forbidding rooms to look at old pictures ranks right up 
there on the boredom scale with visiting distant aunts. A few solemn visits 
with a disinterested parent, and a kid is a confirmed museum-hater for years. 
</P>
<P>
But on a recent weekday, a group of freshly scrubbed elementary students from a 
private school in Sunland looked as if they were bursting with excitement as 
they gathered at the entrance of the J. Paul Getty Museum. It was not the 
wildly extravagant copy of an ancient Roman villa that excited them -- they 
could hardly see any of it from where they were standing. And coming to the 
Getty was not a new experience for them -- they had been here a couple times 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for their excitement soon descended down a marble staircase. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, everybody!" yelled Cathy McCarty-Procopio, museum educator. The kids all 
had huge smiles as she ran up to them, touching several on the head. 
McCarty-Procopio, 26, is the irrepressible, impish pied piper of the Getty. 
When she gives a tour, other staffers follow her around just for fun. And on 
this day, as she guided the Sunland kids around the villa with boundless 
energy, more than one adult visitor wandered over to ask, "Can I join this 
tour?" 
</P>
<P>
Joining her tour meant getting down on the floor at times, as she huddled down 
to get on the same level as the kids, while firing questions in rapid-fire 
sequence and bubbling over with enthusiasm when the students figured out for 
themselves why an artist did something in a certain way or why a certain 
painting or sculpture is important. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I tell you the answer?" she quizzed the students. "No, you got it all by 
yourselves. By looking." 
</P>
<P>
The Getty, like many museums around the country, has come to the conclusion 
that the way to interest kids is to make museum visits interactive. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get the kids to really look, to really use their eyes, to make it 
almost like a game, then going to a museum is fun," said McCarty-Procopio as 
she sat in a garden outside the villa before the students arrived. 
</P>
<P>
She gives the student tours, organized by schools, several times a week. But 
any child, when accompanied by an adult, can take part in the 
McCarty-Procopio's weekend program, Family Circle, that is at the heart of the 
Getty's activities for children. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Circle programs, which are usually held twice a month, switch topics 
monthly to spotlight different parts of the vast Getty collection. The programs 
are free, 1 1/2 to two hours long and are designed for children ranging in age 
from about 8 through 12. Reservations are a must, as the program sessions are 
limited to 15. Each child must be accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that the people who come to museums as adults have a strong 
association of going to museums as a child with an adult who cared about art," 
she said. "It does not have to be a parent -- these days with the family unit 
changing it could be the next-door neighbor who takes the kids to cultural 
activities. But it is important that an adult be there." 
</P>
<P>
The programs include activities such as looking-games, treasure hunts, puzzles 
and even performances, all of which are designed to get historical or artistic 
points across. 
</P>
<P>
This month the topic, "Putting It All Together," is about how artistic scholars 
take a fragment of an ancient object and figure out where it came from, what it 
was used for and its artistic significance. Part one of the program, which will 
be given Saturday, is "Broken but Beautiful" and is about how pottery 
specialists can determine the original appearance of ancient Greek pots from 
their pieces. 
</P>
<P>
After a talk about the importance of fragments -- "We tell about why we keep 
these things instead of tossing them away like a glass that gets broken at 
home" -- each of the student-adult teams will be assigned a different fragment 
in the collection to seek out. By examining it carefully, they will see what 
conclusions they can come to about the pot. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is geared toward making them look for themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 18, in "Puzzling Pots," the program will move on to examining the 
shapes of pots and the designs painted on them. It will start with a lesson on 
how to recognize certain Greek gods and goddesses that show up on the pots. 
"All the men on the vase can tend to look the same," McCarty-Procopio said. "We 
teach them that if you want to find Hercules, for example, you have to look for 
the one wearing the lion's skin." 
</P>
<P>
The children and adults will be assigned different gods and goddesses to look 
for in a gallery full of ancient pots. When they get back together they will 
discuss other things they noticed about color, shape and possible usage. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of that program, each of the participants will be given the 
traditional outline of a pot to decorate as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
"We did this last year and we got some great designs," McCarty-Procopio said. 
"You'd be amazed at all the information kids and adults can pick up, even in an 
hour and a half. Just by looking."

AUTHOR WANTS THEATER TO BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR CHILDREN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Judy Blume, the popular writer of children's novels, is pleased and anxious 
that her "Tales of a Fourth-Grade Nothing" is being staged locally. 
</P>
<P>
She saw the first production in 1986 at the Seattle Children's Theatre, and 
loved it. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Seattle producers first approached her, "it was very scary for me 
to let this one go," she said from her New York home. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the idea of children being exposed to theater," she said. "But I also 
want it to be really good for them. Sometimes kids love a book and then they're 
disappointed at what's been done to it." 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, "the little children were played by older children and the older 
children were played by young people in their 20s." She's "curious how it works 
with both children and adults" playing preschoolers, as they do here. 
</P>
<P>
"How strange," she said. "You have to do it one way or another, it seems to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The script is a "faithful adaptation," she said. "Of all the books, this is 
probably the best one to stage because it's so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Blume said adults shouldn't find anything objectionable in the play's comic 
openness about certain bodily functions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be too young for tinkling or throwing up," she said. "Children know 
that. It's especially important because it brings it right home to them: 'Yes, 
I know about that,' or 'I have a little brother or sister who would do that.' 
</P>
<P>
"Humor is so important to share with our kids. To me, that's a really important 
part of family life. We laugh because we recognize ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Fudge, the play's star mischief-maker, was based on Blume's filmmaker son "when 
he was a toddler." LYNNE HEFFLEY

NUMBER COULD BE UP FOR BINGO HALL; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: THE FOUNDER OF THE WOODLAND HILLS GAMES DENIES DIVERTING MONEY. SHE 
SAYS SHE WILL SHUT DOWN AFTER CLEARING HER NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The tables in the cavernous bingo hall at Identity Inc. in Woodland Hills are 
mostly empty. Bingo nights that once drew 800 players are fetching fewer than 
250. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the decline on a recent evening is the "Queen of Bingo," Edith 
Ryan, the embattled founder of a charity for the physically disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Lower income and government investigations into her operation signal that her 
reign as Los Angeles' biggest bingo operator may be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
The charity and its 64-year-old founder face accusations by ex-associates that 
thousands of dollars in player fees were diverted from the charity on bingo 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the second time in six years, the city is seeking to revoke the 
charity's bingo license, based on allegations that Ryan illegally paid 
bingo-game operators who by law are supposed to be volunteers. Hearings 
continued before a city administrative hearing officer last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan vigorously denies any wrongdoing but said she will close her charity, 
Identity Inc., after clearing her name. "Who will be the loser then?" she asked 
tearfully. "The city's crippled and poor." 
</P>
<P>
The eight-year saga of the bingo queen tells of repeated clashes with city 
officials. The details include a minor police scandal, bitter betrayals by 
longtime associates and even a shoe box filled with a fortune in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, it is about Ryan, whose gruffness and aggressiveness were forged 
during the Depression, when she was one of seven children being reared by a 
widow. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan left Akron, Ohio, to start a new life in Canoga Park after her second 
marriage ended in 1978. She brought a dream of starting a charity for the 
handicapped, born years earlier when her 11-year-old stepson, Shawn Ryan, was 
permanently disabled in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she brought a shoe box filled with gold hoarded for a decade. It 
was worth more than $750,000 after the price of gold skyrocketed in the early 
1980s, she says. 
</P>
<P>
After buying a four-bedroom house in what is now West Hills, Ryan established 
Identity in 1979 simply by filing papers with the California secretary of 
state. But Identity languished while she joined a singles group, enrolled at 
Pierce College and took a $120-a-week job with Prudential Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
(Ryan said she already had a bachelor's degree in psychology from Akron 
University in Ohio and enrolled at Pierce to build up her confidence. But Akron 
has no record of her graduation.) 
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, Ryan said, she fruitlessly pursued funding for Identity. "We 
were spinning our wheels. Every direction we turned we were told there was no 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles voters legalized bingo for charity in 1976. She saw that the game 
could save the organization. To qualify for a license, Ryan got tax-exempt 
status for Identity and paid the city a $50 fee. 
</P>
<P>
The charity opened its doors to bingo players in February, 1982, and promptly 
lost more than $2,000 that month. But there was reason for optimism: Bingo is 
popular in the San Fernando Valley. About half the money wagered on bingo in 
the city is spent in the Valley, though only 30 of the city's 75 bingo games 
are here. 
</P>
<P>
Each Valley player typically spends $45 to $50 a night, about $10 more than 
others in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a tremendous gambling instinct in the Valley," said Don Carrier, 
publisher of the Bingo Bugler, a monthly newspaper based in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1982, Identity was making enough for Ryan to quit her clerical 
job and draw a salary from the charity. It reported a profit for charity of 
about $6,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1983, Identity had moved to a larger hall where as many as 800 
people played 100 games a night, and the profit was as high as $86,700 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Big prizes were one of the attractions. City figures show that 77% of 
Identity's $29-million gross income over the eight years went for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
The game grew into the city's most successful. Its income represented fully 9% 
of the total gross of all games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It also attracted the eye of the city's chief bingo regulator. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was helped by John Defino, a supplier of game equipment. "I learned 
everything I know about the game from him," she said. "He was my mentor." 
</P>
<P>
Defino was not as highly regarded by city officials. In early 1984 they shut 
down his bingo game at Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima on the grounds Defino 
broke the law by working there. State law prohibits suppliers or anyone else 
with a financial interest in bingo from working at games. 
</P>
<P>
When Defino turned up at Identity as a volunteer game caller, his presence 
aroused the suspicions of Robert Burns, general manager of the city's Social 
Service Department, which regulates bingo. 
</P>
<P>
Burns revoked Identity's license in 1984, citing Defino's involvement as both 
supplier and caller at Ryan's games and Ryan's use of bingo proceeds to pay 
insurance premiums for five employees, also a state violation. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan appealed in court, arguing that she had purchased supplies from Defino's 
son and did not know he was related to her game caller. The license was 
restored by a Superior Court judge who called Burns' revocation order 
"excessively harsh, abusive and arbitrary." The judge also ruled that it is 
legal to pay insurance premiums out of bingo proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it in the shorts," Burns said of the case. 
</P>
<P>
What followed has been six years of clashes between the regulator and the 
queen. The fight has helped shape the way the game is played in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Burns urged the City Council to pass two regulations that Ryan said have 
crippled her charity financially. The first, passed in 1988, restricts bingo 
operators to 40 games a night. A year later, the council limited the number of 
players to 350 per session. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, in defending the restrictions, said big operations were hard to police 
and unfair competition for little ones. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has steadily driven up the prize pot, eroding the share for 
charity. In 1980, Los Angeles bingo operators spent 71% of their gross receipts 
on prizes, Burns says. By this year, the figure was 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Burns lays the trend at Ryan's door. 
</P>
<P>
"Edith simply ran the highest-powered game in town, and that put pressure on 
all licensees to increase the size of their prizes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan says Identity spent $65,000 in legal fees to fight the new regulations. It 
had to scale back its charitable services when they took effect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Using bingo proceeds, Identity had been offering counseling and physical 
therapy at the De Soto Avenue facility where the bingo hall is located. Its 
files contain records of 138 clients served since 1985. It also gave money to 
programs for the disabled, such as a wheelchair basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Staats, director of the UCLA Prosthetics Education Program, said that after 
1988 Identity stopped paying for artificial limbs for disabled people who could 
not afford them. Nancy Berry, a counselor with the state Department of 
Rehabilitation, referred clients to Identity until Ryan began turning them 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Identity's financial crunch and Ryan's lobbying against the new regulations 
were overshadowed this summer by at least three investigations of Identity. 
</P>
<P>
Four former Identity bingo workers who had been involved with the games since 
their start told city officials that for years they had been illegally paid for 
their work. Burns' current attempt to revoke Identity's license is based on 
that charge. The hearing before an administrative judge recessed last week 
until Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the workers also said in affidavits that records from one of two tables 
at which bingo cards were sold were routinely destroyed on Ryan's orders and 
the income was not reported. 
</P>
<P>
One of the volunteers, Cindy Houseman, said that an estimated $25,000 was 
diverted during one three-day period in July. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators are looking into the workers' claim. 
</P>
<P>
In another investigation, Los Angeles Police Department internal affairs 
detectives are seeking to determine if several officers who worked off duty as 
security guards at Identity bingo games knew of any illegal handling of money. 
Last week, the department revoked permits allowing officers to work at all 
bingo games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office, which monitors bingo operations, is also 
investigating the allegations of financial improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has denied any wrongdoing and has sought to discredit the workers who have 
turned against her by calling them thieves. She said the bad publicity has 
caused a further drop in attendance at Identity's games. 
</P>
<P>
Few local charity organizations sympathize with Identity. An official of a 
Valley charity who asked not to be identified said "this whole thing gives 
legitimate bingo a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said she is a victim of Burns, who she claimed is pursuing a vendetta 
partly because of his embarrassing failed attack in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Burns is an unmitigated pathological liar -- he sits up there like he's the 
Gestapo," Ryan said. "Here's a city official who should have no ax to grind, no 
personal motive, trying to destroy a legitimate charity." 
</P>
<P>
Some people familiar with Ryan say her personality may be part of her problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Edith is gravelly," Staats of UCLA said. "She is a no-nonsense person. I've 
wondered if someone had a vendetta against her. Edith sometimes rubs people the 
wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, a 28-year Civil Service bureaucrat who earns about $71,000 annually, 
called Ryan's charge that he is vindictive preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
"What is true," he said, "is that after the department was unsuccessful in 
revoking Identity's license I continued to remain suspicious of Identity in 
view of the continued assortment of rumors and speculation that have circulated 
within the bingo community." 
</P>
<P>
Burns also said he is motivated by concerns over what he believes is the 
relatively low level of charitable services Identity provides. He questions 
whether a charity that takes in about $1 million a year should serve only a 
handful of people. 
</P>
<P>
The law sets no minimum percentage of revenue which a charity must use on 
philanthropy. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that such legislation is 
unconstitutional, said Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi, whose office is 
investigating Identity. 
</P>
<P>
Identity's 1988 federal tax form, the most recent available in full, shows that 
29% of the organization's $1.3 million in expenses went for direct charitable 
services. Included were physical therapy, social work, transportation and the 
costs of running a since-closed Woodland Hills house for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money went for operational expenses such as salaries, including 
Ryan's of $39,000, and the $60,000 annual rent for the bingo hall. Expenses 
also included city bingo fees of about $42,000 or 1% of the gross bingo 
receipts minus $5,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan acknowledged that Identity now serves only about 15 clients and has been 
forced by high operating costs to close its four-bedroom house for the disabled 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
To save the charity, Ryan said she has personally loaned Identity $200,000 in 
the last three years. She said she also is using her own money to pay the legal 
tab on the latest license battle with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who now makes $52,000 as Identity's executive director, said there was 
still some gold left and she took out a second mortgage on her house. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Ryan's mood alternated between distress and battle-hardened 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she vowed to win. At another, she said she is burned out. 
</P>
<P>
"When this is over, I will close Identity," she said. "But not until I prove 
everything is right. I have gone through more abuse than anybody should expect. 
. . . Where they should be putting me on a pedestal, they want to put me on a 
stake."

I regret that The Times staff writer Mayerene Barker did not interview me 
before writing her profile on the 21st Congressional District race. If she had, 
I could have prevented her from making some totally erroneous assumptions 
concerning my campaign. 
</P>
<P>
I am not at all "complacent" about my reelection campaign -- I am well aware 
that the voters of my district have the final say in who will represent them. 
The reason I have been unable to mount an aggressive campaign is that until the 
current budget debate and other important legislative business is resolved, my 
primary responsibility is to remain in Washington to represent my constituents. 
My job requires me to vote against plans to raise taxes on working Americans 
and senior citizens, to vote for tough anti-crime legislation and to vote for 
funding for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and for the 
important Calleguas Creek flood control project. 
</P>
<P>
Had I missed those votes, there's no question in my mind that my opponent -- 
and some in the press -- would have been charging me with neglecting my 
responsibilities.

As a relative of a defense worker who lives and works in the 21st Congressional 
District, I was dismayed to see that my congressman, Elton Gallegly, voted 
against the bill that provided money to assist laid-off defense workers with 
job retraining, job search assistance, extended unemployment and other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
There are many defense workers in this district who devoted many years of their 
lives to protecting this country and bringing an end to the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
If this is how he represents the needs of those people, then we need somebody 
else in that position. 
</P>
<P>
I was told that his opponent, Richard Freiman, would have supported that bill. 
I urge you to vote for the man who would protect the livelihood of the workers 
in this district.

LOSS DIMS AZUSA PACIFIC'S HOPES FOR POSTSEASON BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Brian Hunt turned in a record-setting performance but Azusa 
Pacific's hopes for a playoff berth probably ended Saturday when UC Santa 
Barbara defeated the Cougars, 27-23, in a nonconference game at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, which had been in contention for a berth in the National Assn. 
of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II playoffs, dropped to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt completed 40 of 62 passes for 416 yards, eclipsing the school record of 
369 yards that was set by Greg Gano in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt has passed for 2,324 yards this season, breaking Gano's record of 1,918 
that also was set in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Curtius completed 15 of 37 for 291 yards and three touchdowns for Santa 
Barbara (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
Claremont 27, Whittier 22 -- Schon Branum gained 140 yards in 26 carries and 
scored on a 31-yard run to lead the Stags over the Poets in a Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Brian O'Brien completed 15 of 22 for 210 yards and connected with 
Tim Bray on touchdown plays of 12 and four yards for Claremont (2-6, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
Doi Johnson, a 290-pound fullback, gained 41 yards in 12 carries and scored on 
touchdown runs of six yards and one yard for Whittier (0-8, 0-5). 
</P>
<P>
La Verne 44, Pomona-Pitzer 7 -- Jeff Paschal completed 12 of 32 for 290 yards 
and three touchdowns to lead the Leopards (3-5, 2-3) over the Sagehens (3-4, 
2-2) in an SCIAC game at La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Paschal connected on touchdown passes of four and 51 yards to Rod Zerbel and 62 
yards to Chris Nance.

GLENDALE DEFENSE TAKES ITS BOWS AFTER 27-0 WIN OVER HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when tailback Bobby Webster set two school records and quarterback 
Marco Arcipreste threw for nearly 200 yards, it was Glendale College's defense 
that stood out in a 27-0 victory over host Harbor in a Western State Conference 
football game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaquero defense, Glendale's Achilles' heel last season, held Harbor (4-4, 
3-4) to 107 yards in offense, including six yards passing, while posting its 
first shutout. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has improved at a great pace the last two weeks," second-year 
Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. "Everyone seems to be coming together at just 
the right time. . . . We're two weeks away from reaching our goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (6-2, 6-1) are gunning for a WSC Northern Division title and a 
bowl berth, but they will have to get past Moorpark on Saturday if they are to 
meet that objective. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd have to go through Moorpark to win a division title," said 
Arcipreste, who completed 15 of 26 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown. "But 
we also knew there were several other teams we had to beat." 
</P>
<P>
The win improved Glendale's divisional record to 3-0 and was the sixth in a row 
for the Vaqueros. And as in the previous five victories, Webster gained at 
least 100 yards and ran for at least two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman from Pasadena High gained 119 yards in 16 carries and scored three 
times against the Seahawks before leaving the game in the third quarter because 
of leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
His third score -- a 50-yard run -- gave Glendale a 21-0 lead with 12 minutes 
27 seconds left in the third period. It was Webster's 17th touchdown (all 
rushing) of the season and broke school single-season records for touchdowns 
(15) and rushing scores (14). 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Harbor drove as far as the Glendale 27-yard line, but 
Robert Floyd intercepted Bill Inman's pass in the Vaquero end zone for a 
touchback. 
</P>
<P>
"The shutout was important to these guys," Cicuto said. "I think it'll give us 
added confidence going into the Moorpark game." 
</P>
<P>
Webster's first score, a six-yard run, capped a five-play, 41-yard drive with 
1:41 left in the first quarter. His second touchdown, a four-yard burst, 
climaxed an 11-play, 56-yard drive with 9:37 remaining in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Arcipreste, who entered the game averaging 16 pass attempts a game, completed 
nine of 17 for 130 yards in the first half alone.

STUDENT DISPUTES IMAGE OF WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am currently a senior at Westlake High and am enjoying the success of our 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
Our team has worked hard all year and it is finally paying off. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bright spots on our team has been quarterback Todd Preston. I am 
happy to see that Todd is getting the attention he deserves. However in Jeff 
Riley's article of Oct. 25, I found the means by which you praised him 
unforgivable. I am referring to the blatant stereotyping of Westlake students 
in order to show Preston as the kid who has simple tastes as opposed to the 
"Westlake" student. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Preston sticks out at Westlake as much as a snake does in 10-foot grass. 
This may come as a surprise, but the average Westlake student does not own a 
BMW, aspire to be a corporate lawyer, or take part in the "Westlake fashion 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Some of us drive old cars, seek middle-class jobs and wear T-shirts and shorts. 
I'm not too sure where the Westlake in the article is, but the school I attend 
is totally different. Maybe the next time you write about our school, you 
should come and see what Westlake is all about.

SANTA MONICA VOTERS WILL NEED STAMINA; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOTING: 89 CONTESTS WILL BE DECIDED. WEST HOLLYWOOD HAS A SINGLE PROPOSITION 
-- WHETHER A CARD CASINO SHOULD BE ALLOWED. 
</P>

A multi-candidate, multi-issue election that has the potential to redefine the 
political agenda of the '90s in Santa Monica, and a high-stakes referendum over 
legalized gambling in West Hollywood are the big local concerns as Westside 
voters prepare to go to the polls on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Westside, voters also will be selecting repre sentatives in 
Congress and the state Legislature, but veteran Democrats are well entrenched 
in every seat, and the defeat of any incumbent would be a big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, nine candidates are competing for three seats on the City 
Council, and there also are contests for the Rent Control Board, the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of Education, the Santa Monica 
College Board of Trustees and a municipal judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attention in the city, however, has been focused on the ballot 
measures. Among the nine propositions on the city ballot (there is also a 
school district bond issue) are questions dealing with development, crime and 
the homeless, and rent control. 
</P>
<P>
One thing the election will require of Santa Monica voters is stamina. The city 
ballot was so long that it could not be consolidated with the even longer state 
ballot. Voters will thus have to sign in twice and cast separate state and city 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
All told, a Santa Monica voter wishing to cast a vote on every office and issue 
on Tuesday will be making 89 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
If this voter averages 10 seconds per decision, he or she will spend 14 minutes 
and 50 seconds in the voting booth. Small wonder that 6,000 of the city's 
54,000 registered voters have already requested absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
In West Hollywood, by contrast, the election could hardly be simpler. There is 
a single issue going before city voters, Proposition AA, which asks whether 
card-club gambling should be legalized in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is sponsored by a group of investors seeking to open a poker 
casino similar to the large clubs found in Commerce and Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The argument in favor is purely financial: Backers of the proposed casino say 
it would generate $10 million a year for the city, a sum equal to one-third of 
the current year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although West Hollywood faces a financial pinch, and projects a budget gap for 
next year that will have to be covered by cuts in services or a new source of 
revenue, the gambling measure is opposed by every elected city official and all 
major community groups. Most of the opposition is based on the traffic and 
congestion a card casino would generate and the crime the critics say it would 
attract. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the initiative have attempted to circumvent the official opposition 
by appealing directly to West Hollywood by mail and phone. They sent 10,000 
copies of a videotape extolling the virtues of the proposed casino to residents 
targeted as likely voters. As of late last week, they had spent nearly $300,000 
to try to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
Elections also are taking place Tuesday in five Westside congressional 
districts, five Assembly districts and three state Senate districts. 
</P>
<P>
Registered Democrats substantially outnumber Republicans in each district, and 
few Republican candidates have been able to raise the money it would take to 
seriously challenge well-heeled Democratic incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the congressional districts, however, the challengers are making a 
particularly determined effort of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the 23rd Congressional District, which includes such communities as Beverly 
Hills, Westwood, Brentwood, Malibu and parts of the San Fernando Valley, GOP 
candidate Jim Salomon of Beverly Hills has campaigned almost nonstop since 
losing to Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson two years ago. He has attracted 
financial backing from many local Republican business people and has been 
warmly endorsed by the district's most famous Republican, Ronald Reagan. Even 
so, an upset of seven-term incumbent Beilenson would be a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
In the 27th Congressional District, which hugs the coast from Santa Monica to 
the South Bay, West Los Angeles attorney David Barrett Cohen has stumped 
vigorously against Democratic incumbent Mel Levine. Even the most optimistic 
Republicans would be astonished by a Cohen victory on Tuesday, but a good 
showing by the GOP candidate would position him well for 1992, when Levine is 
widely expected to leave the seat open and run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

DUSTING OFF OLD FAIRFAX; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BOOK OFFERS A BACKGROUND OF OIL FIELDS AND AIRFIELDS FOR THE LOS ANGELES 
DISTRICT, WHICH HAS MUSHROOMED INTO THE LARGEST OF JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS WEST OF 
CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Think of the Fairfax District -- small shops selling pickles and salami, old 
folks on bus benches taking in the sun, neat little houses and crowded 
apartments -- and it seems as if it has been there forever. 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't. Less than a lifetime ago, there were little more than bean 
fields, oil fields and airfields in the wide open spaces that became the center 
of Jewish life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And, "in the '60s there was a large exodus out of there . . . it was a little 
bit seedy," said Lynn C. Kronzek, whose book, "Fairfax . . . A Home, A 
Community, A Way of Life," was published this fall by the Jewish Historical 
Society of Southern California. In her research for the book, Kronzek dug up 
some little-known history of the early years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the many changes in the neighborhood, she found few residents who 
have been around since the early days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reminders of the older days that remain are a couple of Irish bars 
and the 56-year-old Farmers Market, whose owner, A. F. Gilmore Co., has held 
the land since 1880 and remains one of the area's largest landowners. 
</P>
<P>
Kronzek said that most people used to think of history as the doings of kings 
and presidents and conquering armies, so hardly anyone bothered to save the 
records or memorabilia of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
So the author, who holds a degree in history, relied mostly on archival sources 
like the municipal files preserved in an annex near Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a storeroom where researchers wear bibs or full-length aprons to ward 
off the orange dust of old records, she found the May 27, 1924, petition in 
which 15 residents asked that the largely empty space on the map known as 
Sherman, Calif., and RFD (rural free delivery route) No. 10 be annexed to the 
city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules in force at the time, the petition had to be signed by at least 
one quarter of the population in the area. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 residents voted in favor and none opposed, the area was included as 
the Fairfax Addition, a name apparently taken in honor of the Colonial Virginia 
family whose coat of arms inspired the emblem of Fairfax High School. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the time -- Ward, Hole, Hackaday, Lee, Newman, Coak, Lightfoot -- 
gave no sign that Fairfax was to become a center of ethnic life, the largest 
Jewish neighborhood west of Chicago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the high school in 1924, the construction of new 
developments and the eventual establishment of the Miracle Mile as an upscale 
shopping district, the population began to grow. 
</P>
<P>
But vast tracts along Wilshire Boulevard stayed empty for years. So empty that 
some parcels were used for airfields. 
</P>
<P>
"One could purchase a flight in a World War I Jenny, if you had the courage," 
one old-timer recalled in the book, which includes a picture of airplanes 
parked on the site of what is now the May Co. store at the corner of Wilshire 
Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Most Los Angeles Jews lived then on the Eastside, in the neighborhoods of Boyle 
Heights and City Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fairfax District offered newer, bigger, more comfortable houses, and 
the Jewish population started moving west, said Kronzek. She used census data 
to track the population shifts. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of religious groups were already meeting in private homes when the 
Etz Jacob congregation built the area's first synagogue in 1932, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, thousands of servicemen from the East Coast were exposed 
to the warm weather and other charms of Southern California. Some eventually 
moved here, and by the late 1940s, Fairfax was well-established as a 
neighborhood of single-family homes, affordable apartments, synagogues and 
social and political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, its heyday was the '50s," Kronzek said. "There was a balance of 
affluence and Jewish culture. But in the '60s a lot of affluent people moved 
out, and Fairfax had to deal with a lot more social issues. Now it's coming 
back and getting very developed." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, with a large-scale commercial development now proposed for 
the Gilmore Co.'s Farmers Market property, and the owners of the Park Labrea 
apartment complex eager to build office buildings and more rental housing, 
"It's hard to even imagine what it's going to be like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A former Fairfax resident, Kronzek said she got interested in local history 
when she and her husband rented a garden apartment at Park Labrea after moving 
from the Washington, D.C., suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
A chance conversation with an official of the Jewish Historical Society led to 
the commission to write the book. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a labor of love, but I lived there and it was interesting and it helps 
you get in touch with your own background," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as a former editor of history books, "It was fun to get a crack at it on 
my own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has since moved on to Playa del Rey, where they found quieter 
streets and ocean air. 
</P>
<P>
Kronzek also found work as a consultant to nonprofit organizations. The Fairfax 
project netted her only a modest fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a full-time project, but it was all-consuming, and when it was done 
I made real money again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen S. Sass, president of the Jewish Historical Society, said the 112-page 
Fairfax booklet, although marred by some typos and fuzzy photographs, is 
notable because it is probably the first history of a Jewish neighborhood in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's been done yet on Boyle Heights or West Adams or any other areas of 
Jewish settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The society now plans to collect oral histories from former residents of those 
areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to move fast, because those memories are dimming or, unfortunately, 
passing away," he said. "At least on Fairfax we have something (left) to 
celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
The booklet can be purchased at the Jewish Historical Society offices at 6399 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 502, for $11.95 or by mail for $13.95.

UCLA AGREES TO HOLD THE LINE ON TRAFFIC; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE UNPRECEDENTED AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO 
HALT CAMPUS GROWTH IF QUOTAS ARE EXCEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An unprecedented agreement was announced Thursday that would allow the city of 
Los Angeles to halt UCLA's planned growth if the school exceeds agreed-upon 
traffic quotas. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would be in effect until the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
As a state university, UCLA is not bound by local regulations, and the UC 
system's autonomy from local interference is closely guarded. Thus, the 
university's willingness to allow the city to police its traffic is a major 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is planning to add 3.71 million square feet of campus facilities under its 
Long Range Development Plan. The plan, announced earlier this year, has been 
met with complaints that such growth would choke the already traffic-plagued 
Westwood area. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the pact announced by city, county, state and university 
officials, UCLA will abide by a mutually agreed-upon limit of 139,500 non-rush 
hour "vehicle trips" a day, 10,500 more than currently measured by the city for 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
A "vehicle trip" is one car or truck crossing UCLA boundaries or entering or 
leaving an off-campus university facility. UCLA is the single largest traffic 
generator in West Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement must be ratified by the University of California Regents and the 
Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The additional 10,500 trips that will be allowed represent UCLA projects 
already approved or under way. The number of acceptable rush-hour trips is 
still under negotiation. Certain non-traffic generating projects, such as 
library facilities, were exempted from the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives the city of Los Angeles an unprecedented role in determining what 
will be developed on the Westwood campus," Westwood-area Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky said at a press conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
City Transportation Department spokesman Tom Connor further noted that this 
agreement is the first time the city will be able to monitor development so 
that a project lives up to promises not to increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Officials lauded the agreement as a model for working out inter-jurisdictional 
disputes for the good of the greater community. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky was joined by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman and Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, all of whom praised 
UCLA's willingness to be a "good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young "showed tremendous courage and leadership in 
agreeing to enter these discussions," Yaroslavsky said. "He's basically saying 
he's putting his money where his mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
Young was out of the country, so Vice Chancellor Peter Blackman represented 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The elected officials made clear that their accord on the traffic plan should 
not be viewed as support for the entire growth plan, about which they voiced 
continued reservations because of its environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from the press conference were members of the local 
homeowner groups that have been fighting the UCLA plan, saying it is too much 
growth in an area that cannot cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
"They played no role in it," said Yaroslavsky. But, he said, "it's hard for me 
to believe that anyone would not see this as a great step forward." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who does not see it that way is UCLA Watch President Alvin Milder. 
Milder said he was disturbed that the lawmakers bypassed their constituents in 
making the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's outrageous. Elected officials are supposed to be representing the 
community and did not consult the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another joke on the community," said homeowner activist Sandy Brown. She 
said she does not view the city as vigilant enough for the traffic watchdog 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic monitoring agreement calls for the city and UCLA to independently 
measure "vehicle trips" in the third week of October, when campus traffic is 
high. UCLA has agreed to absorb some of the cost to the city for the extra 
monitoring. Both sides will submit disagreements to binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement includes an escape clause for the regents and city. If UCLA shows 
"significant change of circumstances within the university, which warrants a 
modification of the long-range educational plans of the UCLA campus" it can 
back out of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an enormous out for UCLA," said community activist Laura Lake. "This 
means all they have to do is say, 'We changed plans.' "

Two Santa Monica men running in today's New York City Marathon will have a 
special inspiration to help them get over "the wall" that many long-distance 
runners face late in the 26.2-mile race: the infectious grin of a 9-year-old 
boy who has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Grant G. Snyder, 28, and Michael T. Gottlieb, 29, have been collecting pledges 
for each mile they run, and will donate the money to the Make-A-Wish Foundation 
of Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization that grants the wishes of children 
with life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the money raised will go to help fulfill the wish of Joaquin Henry 
Grijalva of Valinda to visit Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin, a fourth-grader who says his favorite subject is math, was found to 
have leukemia in March, 1988. The boy's mother, Colleen Grijalva, said Joaquin 
has been waiting for a bone marrow donor since his illness went into remission 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Grijalva said the bone marrow transfer can only be done during the remission 
period, which usually lasts only six months. Joaquin is on the waiting list of 
a national registry for bone marrow, but his family asks that anyone interested 
in being tested for a possible bone marrow match contact the City of Hope 
Hospital in Duarte (818-359-8111). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joaquin's eyes light up as he talks about his upcoming visit to 
Disney World on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be bigger and better than Disneyland," the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and Gottlieb, who have both run marathons in Chicago and Los Angeles, 
said they had already planned to run in New York when they decided to make 
their effort a fund-raiser to benefit children. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make a difference for at least one child," said Snyder, who planned 
to wear a T-shirt with a photo of Joaquin during the race. "Knowing that we are 
running for Joaquin will help us finish the race. He's running a marathon every 
day of his life." 
</P>
<P>
The men, who have adopted the slogan "Two average runners running for an 
exceptional child," hope to raise at least $15,000. Anyone interested in making 
a pledge or a donation may contact the Make-A-Wish Foundation in West Los 
Angeles at (213) 207-3023. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Howard Hansen has been appointed as the medical director of the Child Study 
Center at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
His responsibilities will include providing medical direction and supervision 
for all clinical aspects of programs and services at the center. Since 1980, he 
has been on the consulting staff of St. John's psychiatric department. 
</P>
<P>
The Child Study Center provides mental health and educational services for 
children with special needs and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Julius Lesner will receive the Red Yarmulka Humanitarian Award for his 
volunteer work. The award will be presented by the Pacific Southwest Region of 
the Federation of Jewish Men's Clubs at a dinner on Nov. 18 at Sinai Temple. 
Lesner, who has been recognized for his contributions to the Jewish community 
and in the field of education, is a member of the board of directors at Sinai 
Temple and has also served the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
John J. McDonough, professor of management at UCLA, has been appointed to a new 
term on the Los Angeles County Mental Health Advisory Board by Supervisor Deane 
Dana. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough is a member of the American Accounting Assn. and the Academy of 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alvar Kabe, a Loyola Marymount University part-time professor, has earned 
the Trustees' Distinguished Achievement Award from the Aerospace Corp. 
</P>
<P>
It is the company's highest honor and includes a prize of $15,000 and a bronze 
plaque. Kabe has been recognized for his outstanding contributions in the field 
of structural dynamics of launch vehicles and spacecraft in support of national 
security programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Green, president and a founding member of Heal the Bay, is the 
recipient of the Mount Gay Call Award for Environmental Achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The award was presented at a reception Oct. 17 honoring her support and 
dedication to environmental concerns. 
</P>

SCHOLARS IN RESIDENCE;

<P>
SCHOOLS OFFER HOUSING FOR FACULTY; USC HOPES ITS PROJECT WILL AID NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
USC film professor Michael Renov and his family were tired of renting but 
couldn't afford to buy a house in many Los Angeles neighborhoods. And they had 
neither the inclination to buy a fixer-upper nor the time to brave the commutes 
from exurbias with more reasonably priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USC was concerned that the high cost of Los Angeles-area real estate 
made it difficult to keep and attract top-flight professors. In addition, the 
school had embarked on an ambitious plan to improve the residential 
neighborhood north of campus and to attract more teachers to live there. 
</P>
<P>
So, a match was made. And another step was taken in the national trend for 
universities, particularly in California, to help their faculty and staff 
obtain affordable and attractive housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Renovs soon will be among the first tenants in a 27-unit townhouse 
condominium project that USC is building at Hoover and 30th streets, just two 
blocks from school. 
</P>
<P>
The neo-Craftsman-style development is for USC teachers and staff willing to be 
pioneers both in a neighborhood that many faculty flee after classes and in a 
new financial relationship with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked around and we really felt that for the price the faculty housing 
ended up being, we would either be a great distance from campus or find 
something very small or in need of repair," said Renov, who is chairman of the 
critical studies department at the USC School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Cathy Friedman, an official of a nonprofit organization that 
aids female survivors of crime and domestic violence, bought the largest of the 
USC floor plans: 1,950 square feet, with three bedrooms, three baths, family 
room, study and a two-car underground garage with an internal staircase to 
living quarters. The price: $285,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prices (which start at $140,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath unit) are kept 
relatively low because USC, unlike commercial developers, is not seeking 
profits. In addition, the university is keeping ownership of the land, leasing 
it to the homeowner association. 
</P>
<P>
For the Renovs, other attractions included the prospect of walking to school 
(and thus making a small contribution to lessening auto emissions), proximity 
to the child-care center near campus where their 3-year-old daughter is 
enrolled (their second child is due in a few months) and increased 
opportunities to take advantage of USC cultural and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
All that overcame jitters about crime, isolation and a lack of some 
neighborhood amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are attaching ourselves in some ways to the university," said 
Renov, who has been renting a house in the Carthay Circle area of Los Angeles. 
"We are committing ourselves because we are fairly convinced that this is part 
of a real long-term, broad-based effort to improve the environment of the USC 
community." 
</P>
<P>
That commitment from USC is real, according to Gerald M. Trimble, president of 
the USC Real Estate Development Corp., the university-funded organization that 
is building the $5.6-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 27 units are reserved, and Trimble is so confident of eventual 
sellout that he is planning another 126 units (114 for sale, and 12 for rent) 
on what is now a parking lot across 30th Street, in conjunction with 
neighboring Hebrew Union College. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are supposed to deliver what Trimble described as a "double 
whammy": providing housing as a lure for scholars and creating a university 
community outside USC's gates. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to move into this area and add purchasing power to the 
neighborhood. It's important for the university and we are committed to doing 
that," said Trimble, a former official in the redevelopment agency of downtown 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The USC group also plans a large hotel and office complex on Figueroa Street 
across from campus and has worked on restoration of Victorian homes in the 
North University Park neighborhood, which is a National Register Historic 
District. In the past, USC has been accused of being a land grabber, seeking to 
impose its will on the mainly Latino and black residents in neighborhoods 
surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
With the condos, the school clearly wanted to avoid such a perception. The 
first 27 units are on land donated by the late marine biology professor Irene 
McCulloch, after whom the project is named, and was the site of a small 
apartment house occupied mainly by students, officials said. The next phase 
requires no demolition. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of any possible gentrification are professors wary of the 
neighborhood because of crime, even though USC insists crime statistics in 
North University Park are below the citywide average. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the units and like the project," said one USC teacher who came close 
to buying one of the townhouses but backed off. "While I don't mind renting and 
living in the area, I'm not too thrilled about owning there because of the 
gangs and graffiti. I don't think the value will appreciate enough." 
</P>
<P>
To overcome such resistance, Trimble's firm paid particular attention to 
attractive design and good security at the townhouses, which will be surrounded 
by an ornamental wrought-iron fence and be patrolled by USC campus police. All 
units have studies where an academic can retreat among his books and possibly 
meet with students and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
All that, plus the collegiality of living in an academic community, attracted 
USC neurology professor Richard Thompson and his wife, Judith, a USC 
researcher, to buy one of the three-bedroom units on 30th Street. 
</P>
<P>
They had lived in Stanford University's faculty housing before moving to USC 
and a small condominium in Culver City three years ago. Now they are optimistic 
about North University Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be blunt. Even at Stanford's campus housing there were robberies and 
occasional rapes and assaults, and that's a wonderfully safe place," Richard 
Thompson said. "In the long term, this is going to be a very nice neighborhood 
as USC moves toward the city and the city moves toward USC." 
</P>
<P>
As added bait, USC is putting no limits on resale prices and is not demanding a 
share of profits. (Most schools, such as the UC branches, tie resale prices of 
their university-built housing to various indexes and take a portion of 
profits.) Some buyers can even get favorable mortgage deals from the university 
credit union and grants for closing costs from the university. 
</P>
<P>
However, like many other universities, USC has placed some restrictions on 
resale to ensure the future buyers are on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
USC is a relative latecomer to the faculty housing field in California. For 
example, UCLA, Stanford and UC Irvine long have been involved in the field. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has the opposite problem of USC: The Westwood campus is surrounded by some 
of the priciest real estate in the nation and little is available. 
</P>
<P>
Through purchases or its own construction, UCLA has 144 apartments and 52 
condos in Westwood for teachers to rent or buy at favorable rates. In addition, 
in 1986 UCLA built 58 faculty townhouses north of campus in the Beverly Glen 
area, which sold at the time for between $155,000 and $255,000. 
</P>
<P>
The school is expected to break ground this autumn for 86 large single-family 
faculty houses in the Bluffs area of Westchester. Those are expected to sell 
for about $500,000, a price that is startling to most non-Angelenos but well 
below what a commercial developer would charge, officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has stories of faculty who come here from out of state and 
everything looks fine until they start looking for housing. Then you get 
various adjectives they use to describe their state of shock," said Harold W. 
Horowitz, executive assistant to UCLA's chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has lost both potential hires as well as professors who were already on 
the staff because of housing costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
UC schools also offer below-market-rate mortgages for both university-built and 
private housing. Decisions on who should get those loans and homes can be 
difficult, with department chairmen evaluating how important a particular 
professor is to the school and how badly that faculty member needs housing 
help. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine has 388 faculty housing units on campus and 44 more are being 
planned. The existing homes range from one-bedroom condominiums that sold for 
about $100,000 to three bedroom detached houses that sold for $300,000, all 
well below the prices in the Orange County market off-campus. And, faculty can 
walk or ride bicycles to class, avoiding the freeway snarls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear this housing is part of the inducement to recruit faculty to 
Orange County," said Leon Schwartz, UC Irvine's vice chancellor for 
administrative and business services. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, a majority of teachers live in Pasadena, Culver City and the South Bay 
cities but only about 20 in neighborhoods adjacent to campus, according to 
Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
The university could have reinforced that pattern by building condominiums in 
suburban communities and developing a shuttle van system to school, but that 
would have done nothing for the campus neighborhood, not to mention the freeway 
traffic situation and parking crunch, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next eight years, Trimble wants to build as many as 300 faculty 
housing units in the USC area. "If it's going to work anywhere," he declared, 
"it's going to work two blocks from campus."

WHOM DOES THE REALTOR REALLY REPRESENT?; 
</P>
<P>
ALLEGIANCE: THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE LISTING AGENT'S 
PRIMARY LOYALTY IS TO THE SELLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a syndicated real estate columnist.

<TEXT>
<P>
You have probably heard that this is a great time to purchase a home during the 
current buyer's market. So you drop in at a few Sunday open houses. The 
friendly real estate agents are only too eager to answer your questions and act 
as your agent for buying a home. 
</P>
<P>
But be careful. If the agent you speak with is the listing agent, no matter how 
nice and friendly he or she might be, his or her primary loyalty is to the home 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
Before you get heavily involved in the home-buying game, please spend a few 
moments to understand whom the real estate agent really represents. 
</P>
<P>
The listing agent. The real estate broker who obtained the listing of the home 
for sale is known as the listing agent. He or she has a fiduciary duty to the 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
During the listing term, the listing agent must tell the seller all material 
facts that develop, such as comments of prospective buyers about the home as 
well as any unfavorable information that the agent learns, such as city plans 
to widen the street in front of the house to a four-lane expressway. 
</P>
<P>
However, questions remain unanswered as to how much information the listing 
agent must disclose to prospective buyers. Obviously, the listing agent must 
tell the buyer about all known defects in the property. 
</P>
<P>
But should the listing agent tell prospective buyers that the house is in 
foreclosure and the seller must sell quickly to avoid losing the house? Or 
should the listing agent disclose that the house is being sold due to divorce 
or bankruptcy? If it is a material fact, the listing agent must disclose it to 
the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose the home is listed for sale at $150,000, but the seller tells the 
listing agent she will take $125,000. Must the listing agent disclose this 
confidential information to a prospective buyer? No. Price information is 
considered opinion and need not be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The dual agent. Getting back to our scenario where you meet the listing agent 
at a Sunday open house of the listed property. You already know the listing 
agent represents the seller. But who represents you? If you wish, the listing 
agent can act as a dual agent and represent both the seller and the buyer. 
However, this seems like an inherent conflict of interest, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The real estate industry is one of the few where one agent can legally 
represent both parties to a transaction. Lawyers, for example, wouldn't think 
of representing both husband and wife in a divorce. But one real estate agent 
can represent both seller and buyer without running afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
But problems can develop with a dual agency. For example, suppose the seller 
tells the listing agent not to say a word about the barking dog and the 
obnoxious neighbors who hold noisy all-night parties next door. Must the 
listing agent tell the prospective buyers about this? 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, when one agent represents both buyer and seller there are 
opportunities for conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The sub-agent. Another agent possibility is the agent who finds a buyer for the 
house who does not want to act as the buyer's agent, but as a sub-agent of the 
listing agent. This was the common situation when the listing agent put the 
listing on the local multiple listing service and offered sub-agency to any 
member agent who located an acceptable buyer. 
</P>
<P>
However, this circumstance has recently changed. Many multiple listing services 
no longer offer sub-agency and now require an agent producing a buyer to 
represent the buyer exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer's agent. Many multiple listing services allow the agent who locates a 
buyer to represent the buyer exclusively. This is possible even when the 
listing agent and the selling agent split the sales commission paid by the 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one situation when an agent cannot represent the buyer 
exclusively. It occurs when one agent with a brokerage is the listing agent and 
another agent with the same firm produces the buyer. Then the agents can act 
either as both seller's agents or dual agents. But the selling agent cannot act 
as the buyer's agent exclusively because that would be an inherent conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The unrepresented buyer. Finally, we come to the situation where the buyer is 
not represented by any real estate agent. This can happen, for example, in our 
first scenario where the listing agent shows the buyer the listed home. 
</P>
<P>
Although the listing agent can write up and present the purchase offer to the 
seller, the listing agent can choose to represent the seller exclusively. Then 
the buyer has no agent. 
</P>
<P>
Another situation where the buyer is not represented by an agent occurs where 
the agent who obtains the purchase offer from a buyer wants to act as a 
sub-agent of the listing agent. This arrangement was the traditional method and 
still is widely used in many states. But buyers should be informed that nobody 
is looking out for their interests when both agents represent the seller. 
</P>
<P>
At this point you are probably thinking this is a very confusing joke. But the 
vested interests in the real estate sales industry want to keep things the way 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors resisted agency disclosure, and only under threats from the 
Federal Trade Commission did they reluctantly agree to disclose to buyers and 
sellers who really represents whom. As a result, most states now require real 
estate agents to disclose in writing which agent, if any, represents you. 
Further information on this still-developing agency situation is available from 
local real estate attorneys.

HOT PROPERTY: POP ENTERTAINER GOES COUNTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop singer JANET JACKSON has purchased a newly built home in northern San Diego 
County, which closed escrow a few days ago at about $4 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, sister of singer Michael, agreed to buy the home while it was under 
construction last summer during her "Rhythm Nation" tour, which is in Osaka, 
Japan, this weekend. Jackson also has a townhouse at MountainGate in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Her new home, in a largely rural area, was advertised at $4,485,000, with six 
or more bedrooms and 6 1/2 baths in 10,000 square feet. It also has a swimming 
pool, tennis court and what local realtors describe as "beautiful sunset 
views." 
</P>
<P>
The home sits on a 2.1-acre hill overlooking Rancho Santa Fe Farms, a new 
community that is contiguous to Fairbanks Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The house is near the Del Rayo Downs residence of actress Ann Blyth and the 
Rancho Santa Fe homes of the late actor Victor Mature, country-rocker Juice 
Newton, longtime "Miss America" host Bert Parks, astronaut Wally Schirra, 
novelist Joseph Wambaugh and retired football commissioner Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
None of the agents involved in Jackson's transaction was available for comment, 
but the home had been listed with Prudential California, and Jackson was 
represented by Fairbanks Ranch Realty.

Marrying Man," has sold her Hollywood Hills house in a one-day escrow for about 
the same price that she paid for it last May -- nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"She sold it because she's never here," one of the sources reporting the sale 
said, "but four other people besides the buyer, a theatrical agent, wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
The house was in demand, he said, because of its spectacular city view. The 
one-story, 1,700-square-foot hideaway has only one bedroom but is behind gates, 
on half an acre and has a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Basinger bought the 1,728-acre town of Braselton, Ga., with a 
Chicago company, and plans were announced to develop a film and recording 
center there. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Crane of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young represented both sides in the 
Hollywood Hills deal but couldn't be reached for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian/actor LENNY CLARKE is settling into his new Marina del Rey home while 
waiting for CBS to reschedule his sitcom, "Lenny," which premiered in September 
but was pulled in October, with a new time period "to be announced shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke and his wife, Ferd, were renting in the Marina and liked it so much, 
they decided to stay when they bought their first home -- a newly built house 
with three bedrooms and 3 1/2 baths in about 4,000 square feet on a lagoon with 
a water view. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a great deck with a view of the ocean and city," said Mark Litman 
with REMAX West in Woodland Hills, who represented the Clarkes. 
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't disclose the purchase price, but public records indicate that the 
Clarkes paid $1,185,000 for their new home. 
</P>
<P>
British writer/director CLIVE BARKER has purchased the Beverly Hills-area home 
of actor ROBERT CULP and his wife, Candace, who bought a home in Brentwood, it 
was just learned. 
</P>
<P>
Barker, who wrote and directed the 1987 horror movie "Hellraiser," based on his 
novella "Hellbound Heart," recently adapted his own horror novel "Cabal" for 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
He paid $1.95 million, public records show, for the Culps' home, which was 
built in 1926 and has four bedrooms and five baths in about 4,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Culps listed the house in January, at $2,495,000, because they wanted to 
move farther west to be closer to their young daughter's school. 
</P>
<P>
Their new home has three bedrooms and two baths in slightly less than 2,000 
square feet, built in 1952. They bought it for $1.25 million, according to 
public records. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Culp, probably best known for his 1960s "I Spy" series with Bill Cosby, 
was reunited on television last June with Cosby on a segment of "The Cosby 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
The buyer of movie mogul CECIL B. DE MILLE's Los Feliz compound (Hot Property, 
Oct. 14) has been identified as a Japan-based firm headed by an entrepreneur 
named Shinji Ichimura who collects '30s and '40s Hollywood memorabilia, 
including the piano from the 1942 film "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
He also has a nightclub called "Casablanca" in Tokyo, according to Vivian 
Hanover of the Jon Douglas Pacific Palisades office, who represented the buyer. 
The De Mille compound is being turned into his personal museum and American 
headquarters, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Ichimura's firms, Ichimura International and Nikken USA, buy completed 
nightclubs and shopping malls, but the $3.9-million home purchase was 
reportedly the first real estate acquisition for either company in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Emmy-nominated character actor TIGE ANDREWS, who played with Henry Fonda in the 
movie "Mr. Roberts" and more recently appeared in CBS-TV's "Murder She Wrote," 
is selling 72 acres of Calabasas land that he has owned for some time. 
</P>
<P>
He put the land on the market as seven 10-acre home sites, zoned for horses and 
houses and priced from $1.5 million to $1.6 million. Robert Friedman in the 
Woodland Hills office of Fred Sands Realtors has the listings.

SPEAKING OUT: BUILDING HOME IN ALASKA WAS KIT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER: Dye is a Times science writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere along the way we realized we were doing something wrong. We were 
shipping logs to Alaska, and that just didn't sound right. 
</P>
<P>
But by then it was too late to turn back. The vacation home that we had dreamed 
of building near Juneau, Alaska, had been launched, and before it would all 
end, we would become intimate with more bankers than we knew existed, we would 
look down the precipitous road to bankruptcy many times and we would meet 
dozens of construction workers who became our friends. 
</P>
<P>
My wife, Sherie, grew up in Alaska as the daughter of a federal wildlife 
officer, spending many of her early years in small villages where her father 
had been sent to impose white man's rule on a native population. It was not an 
easy life. For years she was a redhead because of the rust in the water in the 
home where the Morgan family lived on the banks of Bristol Bay. But she grew to 
love that magnificent land. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of a century ago, she left it. For reasons I will never 
understand she gave up the majesty that is Alaska to share her life with me. It 
meant moving to a smoggy city to the south where editors at a metropolitan 
newspaper could rule our lives, and it meant that only occasionally could she 
journey north to cleanse her soul, not to mention her eyeballs. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago I vowed that someday I would build a house in Alaska for her. 
But as we made our many pilgrimages north I grew to love the state almost as 
much as she did, so we can dispense with any sense of nobility here. The 
decision to build was made by both of us in the face of wise counsel that said 
we were nuts. 
</P>
<P>
So about a decade ago we began to look for a lot in Juneau, where Sherie's 
parents and three brothers live. But despite the fact that Alaska is by far the 
largest state in the union, very little land was for sale, and what was 
available commanded Southern California prices. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire state is locked up by federal, state and local governments, 
as well as native corporations established years ago as part of a land 
settlement act that cleared the way for the construction of the Alaska 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
We had all but given up hope until the last day of our vacation three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
While driving toward town we saw a "for sale" sign on a small beachfront lot. 
The lot was so small that locals thought it was unbuildable. It was only a 
third of an acre, minuscule by Alaskan standards. But it was at a price that we 
could afford, and the next day we bought it while we were literally on the way 
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
That was our first mistake. Don't ever buy a piece of land until you have 
studied every inch of it. 
</P>
<P>
The realtor had insisted that the lot had a building pad on the beach beneath a 
jungle that had grown up in recent years. The next year, when we explored our 
lot for the first time, we learned that the jungle covered nothing but a steep 
slope that dropped nearly straight into the water. But it was ours, and we 
decided to build. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to me then that only a log house would do for our dream home in 
Alaska, and we spent weeks studying sales brochures from some of the 200-plus 
outfits that offer log home kits. We finally decided on a 1,400-square-foot, 
two-story beauty manufactured by Greatwood Log Homes of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure said the logs were hand-peeled, preserving the natural beauty of 
the white cedar logs, and it insisted that construction of the house would be 
comparable in cost to a conventional home. 
</P>
<P>
That was our second mistake. Don't believe everything you read in sales 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
We made our first of what was to be many trips to the bank that held the 
mortgage on our San Pedro home, which we had purchased 18 years earlier before 
prices went goofy. We are both just working stiffs (Sherie is a nurse) and we 
decided to use the equity in our home here to build our home there. 
</P>
<P>
It made sense then, because our home here was nearly paid off, but you should 
see our mortgage now! 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks our log "kit," or so they described it in the brochure, was on its 
way north and we found ourselves shipping logs to Alaska. Even before they 
arrived, we realized we were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Our beach lot threatened to become part of the inland waterway unless we did 
something to protect it before building our house. And along came Bruce Morley, 
an Abe Lincoln look-alike who owns a large gravel pit and never saw a vacant 
lot that couldn't use a little more dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said that what our lot needed was a retainer wall along to beach to 
protect our future home from a sea that can become fierce. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded reasonable and Bruce moved quickly to the task. He trucked in rocks 
the size of small cars and tumbled them down the nearly vertical chunk of land 
that we called "our lot." The huge boulders crashed through the trees and 
landed on the beach with a sickening thud, a sound that was to echo through my 
wallet every time Bruce's truck stopped with another load of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Bruce showed up with the largest rig I had ever seen, a giant yellow 
tractor with massive claws on one end that made it look like a refugee from the 
Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Time to get to it," Bruce said cheerfully, and then he drove over the edge of 
the abyss that we still thought of as "our lot." The huge contraption roared 
down the nearly vertical slope and stopped abruptly in front of the pile of 
rocks. Bruce used the claws to pick up each rock. He turned them this way and 
that until satisfied that he knew every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Then he began a bit of craftsmanship like I had never seen before. He put each 
rock in place with loving care, and by the time he had finished he had built a 
magnificent rock wall that ran the entire width of out lot. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce climbed down from his mechanical beast, grinning broadly, and I blurted 
out: "It looks like an Incan ruin." 
</P>
<P>
The grin faded for a moment, and then returned. "I think that's a compliment," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the building pad in, our "kit" arrived by ship and workers began unloading 
it on the dock. And they unloaded. And they unloaded some more. 
</P>
<P>
An entire house arriving at one time is a truly awesome sight. Especially if 
you had planned to put the thing up yourself while on vacation. Piles of lumber 
and logs towered over us as we walked through the mess, comprehending for the 
first time the depth of the hole into which we had plunged ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
We needed help. And lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
And along came Marquam George, a young contractor with a backward sounding name 
who took one look at our vertical lot and said: "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
Over the following months we found enough problems to tame the Persian Gulf. It 
seems our "kit" was not exactly what one envisions when contemplating a kit. It 
was more like a mountain of materials out of which we were supposed to build a 
house. The construction manual that came with the kit read a little different 
than the sales brochure. 
</P>
<P>
The logs, for example, were only partially peeled. It was up to the builder to 
finish the task. That translated into weeks of draw knifing, resorting to 19th 
Century building techniques that left my shoulders sore for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," Marquam said. 
</P>
<P>
Marquam and his buddy, Bill Bosse, whose idea of recreation is skin diving in 
Alaska, figured peeling the logs was the easy part. Getting them down the hill 
was the tough part. 
</P>
<P>
In my inexperience, I had figured that we would hire a huge crane that would 
set the entire kit on the building pad below. But then we discovered that if we 
set the kit on the pad, there would be no room to build the house. And the lot 
sloped at just the right angle to make the use of a crane impossible. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the entire house, every nail, every piece of wood, every 
door and every window, had to be carried down the steep hillside by hand. To 
me, it seemed impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," Marquam said. 
</P>
<P>
Every few days, some poor devil would show up, looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
"Grab a few logs," Marquam would tell him. At the end of the day, the fellow 
would take his pay and usually disappear forever. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end it all got done. What I didn't know about Marquam when we first 
met was that this is a man who loves to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
A magnificent stairway with 56 steps now hides the steep slope. The house is 
nestled at the foot of the lot, protected by Bruce's wall. As it turns out, 
each of Marquam's friends who worked on the house was the best craftsman in his 
particular speciality that I have ever met, and there is absolutely nothing in 
the house that we would change today. 
</P>
<P>
Ours was a rather extraordinary experience in that we were fortunate to hire a 
contractor who never gave us the slightest reason to question his personal 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
During my vacation I worked an the house myself and Marquam hovered over me to 
the point that I sometimes wondered just whose house it was. What was 
acceptable to me frequently fell below his standards, and more than once I 
caught someone else correcting my mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
We had an additional problem in that much of the construction was completed 
while we were in Los Angeles, leaving the contractor in the difficult position 
of having to explain complicated matters over the telephone and asking us how 
we wanted something done. More often than not, we ended up saying "whatever 
seems best to you, Marquam." 
</P>
<P>
We never had a reason to regret that. 
</P>
<P>
What grew out of all that was a trusting relationship between contractor and 
owner that, I realize, was quite unusual. When the price soared beyond what any 
of us had anticipated, we knew it was because of the peculiar nature of our 
project, and Marquam's quest for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
We never had an argument over a bill. A lot of bankers grew to appreciate that. 
</P>
<P>
And now it is finished. Around the first of each month, when payments on 
various debts come due, from time to time I question my sanity. It is, after 
all, a house we can only use occasionally. But when we ask if we would do it 
all over again, we always come up with the same answer: 
</P>
<P>
No problem.

CHOICE IS WIDE FOR LOW-FLOW WATER SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
IRRIGATION: DIFFERENT DRIP SYSTEMS SERVE DIFFERENT PLANTINGS. KITS ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR MOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What people call drip irrigation can actually be several types of systems. 
"Drip" should probably be called "low-flow," "low-pressure" or "low-volume" 
irrigation because that's the one thing the various systems have in common. 
</P>
<P>
The methods all operate on low water pressure with a low rate of application -- 
they deliver the water slowly so it can soak in. 
</P>
<P>
Because they operate at low pressure and low volume, you can hook quite a few 
devices up to one garden faucet, or one valve. In fact, a big advantage of drip 
irrigation is that you do not need a lot of valves. One for the front yard and 
one for the back is usually enough. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the various low-flow systems in broad groups, with some suggestions 
for starter kits. Pictured are some of the components from the kits, plus a few 
components available only through irrigation suppliers (see the Yellow Pages), 
to give you an idea of the great variety available if you are ready to assemble 
your own system from scratch: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drip tubing, emitters 
</P>
<P>
This is what most people think of when you say drip -- skinny little tubes 
(one-quarter-inch tubing), often called "spaghetti" with individual "drippers" 
or emitters, along the way or at the ends. The spaghetti fans out from larger 
pipes (one-half-inch tubing). 
</P>
<P>
The emitters have very small orifices so that water drips out slowly. As it 
soaks in it also spreads out so it waters a much larger area than you think. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these tiny orifices tended to clog, which gave drip systems a bad 
name, but better filters and "torturous path" or "turbulent flow" emitters have 
helped tremendously. The filters screen out the inevitable particles found in 
our water and a zigzag channel inside the emitters keeps the water turbulent so 
that solids do not have a chance to settle. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the inexpensive starter kits that are commonly available use separate 
emitters and skinny drip tubing. If you plan to water individual plants -- 
young trees, shrubs or shrubby ground covers -- that are spaced several feet 
apart, this is the easiest system to put together. It is also easy to add onto 
later. 
</P>
<P>
And if you vary the size of the emitters (which determines how much water comes 
out, measured in gallons per hour -- gph), you can give different plants 
different amounts of water. It is also easy to figure out how long to leave 
this kind of system on. 
</P>
<P>
Drip Mist makes inexpensive kits. Raindrip makes several sophisticated starter 
kits with turbulent flow emitters and pressure compensating devices, as does 
Drip Irrigation Garden (DIG). Rain Bird makes kits with pressure-compensating 
emitters with with self-cleaning diaphragms. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure-compensating devices -- different than the pressure regulators at the 
beginning of the system -- are contained in each emitter and ensure that the 
amount of water coming out of emitters at the far end of the system is the same 
as that close to the faucet. 
</P>
<P>
Such devices are important on long runs of tubing or on hillsides. In fact, it 
is hard to imagine watering a hillside with anything other than 
pressure-compensating emitters -- there is virtually no runoff and plants at 
the bottom of the hill get as much as plants at the top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In-line emitters 
</P>
<P>
In some applications, there are problems with spaghetti tubing and individual 
emitters. The tubes can be unsightly (you may bury the tubing, but not the 
emitters), they are in the way when weeding or cultivating, dogs make a mess of 
them and there are a lot of parts to keep track of. 
</P>
<P>
So when plants are spaced close together (as in flower beds or vegetable 
gardens or even in areas where trees or shrubs are close together), you might 
consider "in-line emitters." 
</P>
<P>
In-line emitters -- almost always turbulent-flow types -- are hidden inside the 
main tubing, are between short lengths of solid tubing. Because the tubing is 
much larger, it tends to stay put, and while you can't bury the tubing, you can 
hide it under a mulch. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly nice kit (pictured) is offered through the mail by The Natural 
Gardening Co. Raindrip also makes a new in-line system. 
</P>
<P>
A variation on this theme uses separate emitters, but they are punched into the 
sides of larger tubing, with a simple hand punch, so there is not a maze of 
spaghetti. Again, this works best where plants are fairly close together, 
although you can vary the placement of the emitters so you are not watering 
empty ground anywhere. Rain Bird makes a new kit using half-inch tubing. (The 
pieces, not available as a kit, are available separately through irrigation 
suppliers. They are made by Olson Irrigation Systems, 10910 Wheatlands Ave., 
Santee, Calif. 92071, (800) 776-5766.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drip tape 
</P>
<P>
Used extensively by agriculture, drip tapes are just beginning to show up as 
kits. Agricultural tapes are short-lived, designed to be disposable; homeowner 
versions are sturdier. Some even have tortuous paths molded inside the 
flattened tube-like tape. They work much like the in-line drip systems, with 
holes evenly spaced along the lengths of tape. 
</P>
<P>
However, most can not turn corners and must be laid in fairly straight lines or 
they become pinched, which cuts the flow. Drip Irrigation Garden makes a 
simple, inexpensive kit with torturous paths molded into the tubing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Porous piping 
</P>
<P>
Not to be confused with perforated, laser-drilled piping (which is not 
available in kit form and is intended only for short runs), porous piping 
"sweats" water though many little pores. It is best when buried. Porous piping 
is favored in flower beds where plants are very close together because it 
cannot be seen. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to run 600 feet of porous piping off a single faucet, and 
filters are usually not included in kits. Pipes are simply flushed 
occasionally, but a filter is nevertheless a good idea. Moisture Master makes 
kits and sells fertilizer injectors/filters separately. 
</P>
<P>
The flow in porous piping is determined by little disks placed at the 
beginning. Disks that create flows of 1, 2 or 4 gallons a minute are available. 
Note that this is per minute, not per hour, as flow is usually measured in drip 
emitters. 
</P>
<P>
(To compare porous pipe to individual emitters, figure out how much water is 
coming out of any one foot of pipe, by dividing the total flow by the length of 
the pipe. With the smallest flow disk, a foot of pipe in a run 50 feet long, 
will have a flow of 1.2 gallon per hour, which is close to the typical 1 gph 
drip emitter.) 
</P>
<P>
Hydro-Grow is another porous pipe system, available through the mail from 
Gardener's Supply. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mini-sprinklers 
</P>
<P>
The newest idea in low-flow irrigation devices are tiny sprinklers. Unlike 
regular sprinklers, these put water on slowly, so it has time to sink in and is 
not lost to runoff. Because the droplets are small, you cannot operate 
mini-sprinklers when the wind is blowing. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-sprays or jets are similar but simpler still. They are most like the shrub 
heads used with sprinkler systems -- a simple jet of water -- but again they 
apply the water slowly. They cover less area so more are needed but they are 
almost invisible if the supply pipe is buried. 
</P>
<P>
Neither are for lawns, but are for ground cover areas or other plantings where 
there are lots of individual plants close together. Gardeners fond of 
perennials and other flowers like them a lot because they are less 
trouble-prone and easy to fix. 
</P>
<P>
If they clog, you notice it right away. They are very easy to install -- it 
takes just minutes -- and they feel more familiar since you can see how much 
ground is being wetted. 
</P>
<P>
They are also good for azaleas and other shallow-rooted plants that need a 
large, shallow area wetted. 
</P>
<P>
Raindrip makes a mini-sprinkler kit and more systems are on the way. Raindrip's 
operate at a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch and the 180-degree heads 
deliver only 6 gallons per hour, compared to an ordinary sprinkler which pours 
the water at a rate of about 60 to 180 gallons per hour. Putting this kit 
together is more fun than Tinkertoys. 
</P>
<P>
DIG also makes a kit. (Mini-sprays and sprinklers by Olson Irrigation Systems, 
not available in kit form.) 
</P>
<P>
No particular drip irrigation system seems to be ideal for all uses. All have 
their advantages, and gardeners will most likely use more than one kind of 
drip. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of vegetables will be irrigated one way, flowers another, ground covers 
another, trees and shrubs yet another. Special plants like azaleas will get 
their own special system. Conventional sprinklers are still the only way to 
irrigate lawns. 
</P>
<P>
If this great variety of systems leaves you confused, don't worry. If you stick 
with kits, they do come with instructions. Just choose a kit that most suits 
your needs -- for watering flowers, or shrubs, ground covers, or whatever need 
irrigating more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Next: How long you should water.

GOING ORGANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting an organic garden started and helping it to flourish is easier than you 
might suspect, and it's well worth the effort. In the balmy climate of Southern 
California, you won't have many of the disease or insect problems you might in 
less hospitable place, which makes gardening organically easier from the word 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Organic gardening is more than avoiding the use of chemical pesticides or 
fertilizers. It's a cohesive approach to soil health and balance that 
encourages lush plant growth and discourages "bad" bugs with natural predators. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Maltas, who runs Fetzer Vineyards' 5-acre experimental farm in Hopland, 
Calif., is the envy of any gardener just starting out on organics -- and of 
many who have been gardening organically for a while. The Fetzer garden is 
immaculate, lush and extremely productive, and you would swear that no aphid 
had ever ventured anywhere close. 
</P>
<P>
Maltas has a few tips for budding organic gardeners: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't start too big. You can grow all the vegetables one family could want in 
a 20-by-25-foot garden. Even 100 square feet will give you enough space for 
almost anything you want to grow. 
</P>
<P>
* Before you touch a shovel or a hoe, sit down with a piece of graph paper and 
plan your entire garden. Figure out exactly where the "hardscapes" -- paths and 
drip irrigation systems -- should go first. 
</P>
<P>
* Make a list of the vegetables and herbs your family really likes. Why waste 
space on radishes if no one is going to eat them? Decide if you want just 
enough to eat what's in season or if you want ample quantities for canning. Or 
maybe you'll choose to plant only flowers. Regardless, realize that you can't 
do it all at first, so aim small. 
</P>
<P>
* If your family is like most, you should probably include two or three tomato 
plants (try a couple of different varieties, including a yellow or an Italian). 
Plan on planting several dozen lettuce plants, and stagger the planting so that 
you'll have fresh salads all summer long. About five pepper plants of different 
varieties will give you a good selection, and you'll definitely want several 
basil and oregano plants. 
</P>
<P>
* Prepare your soil by cutting out the sod and taking it away -- don't just 
turn it under or you'll have a garden full of grass within a month. Dig in as 
many bags of compost as you can find or make. 
</P>
<P>
* Tamp the pathways down hard and you'll cut way back on the amount of weeding 
you have to do. Many gardeners cover their paths with pea gravel or wood chips 
to help choke weeds back. If you can keep the paths weed-free, it will be much 
simpler to keep the occasional weed that appears among your vegetables pulled. 
Plus, your good planning will ensure that the paths don't get watered; without 
water, no weeds. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your planting plan for next season. You don't want to plant the same 
vegetables in the same spots year after year, especially those from the cabbage 
family. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid any chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Many organic gardeners 
supplement with fish emulsion -- just follow the directions on the bottle. Pick 
off bugs by hand or wash with mildly soapy water if you get an infestation of 
leaf hoppers or aphids. Some people swear that tobacco juice works wonders on 
the pests, others just spray with clear water a couple of times a day to keep 
them washed off. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to think about how each of your actions as a gardener affects the whole, 
not just the effect on a specific symptom. This is the critical difference 
between organic and conventional gardening.

ASK THE INSPECTOR: GOOD ADVICE AVAILABLE TO PREPARE FOR 'BIG ONE' 
</P>

QUESTION: What advice do you have for surviving the "big" earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There is too much good information available for us to presume to 
provide an original answer. Instead, read the following (in about the order of 
their complexity): 
</P>
<P>
 -- Telephone book advice on shutting off gas, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Beat the Quake" brochure prepared by the state, available from regional 
Earthquake Preparedness Offices at (619) 238-3321; (818) 795-9055; (415) 
893-0818; (916) 427-6659.

Inspectors Do Mind Business of Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why don't home inspectors stick to code enforcement and stay out of such 
areas as roof wear and safety enhancements? I think you all overstep your 
bounds by making a big deal out of things that are none of a buyer's business. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your concept of a home inspector's job is simply wrong; in any case far from 
how most people construe it. Your concept of what is a home buyer's business is 
archaic, dating from the days of caveat emptor. 
</P>
<P>
Today because of a combination of high prices and court decisions, buyers 
expect the homes they buy to be safe and maintained. "Code" allows for any 
number of pre-existing conditions which a prudent buyer will want to be aware 
of. Code does not apply to the wear and deterioration that may result in 
imminent expenses. Items such as these are the buyer's business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hollow-Core Doors Often Not Maintained 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you comment on the hollow-core doors that builders have been using for 
exterior applications? It seems to me that they are pure junk, and should not 
be allowed? 
</P>
<P>
A: The doors you refer to are approved for use outdoors; the problem is mostly 
with installation and maintenance. Painters tend to be lax about thoroughly 
painting such doors thoroughly (especially the top and bottom edges), and 
homeowners tend not to maintain the paint seal. 
</P>
<P>
When there are unsealed edges or other places that allow water penetration, the 
door skins delaminate, damaging the doors. This is presumably the basis of your 
complaint. I think of such doors as expendables, cheaply replaced if they are 
not maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Although I usually find them damaged, the cost of replacement is nominal, and 
the risk of other damage if not replaced is virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wood Stove Near Wall Could Be a Time Bomb 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm afraid that my free-standing wood stove may be too close to the frame 
wall. Since it looks fine and it has been there for years, I'm of a mind to 
conclude that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." Any comments? 
</P>
<P>
A: You could have a time bomb in this stove, and must not dismiss the risk. 
Wood that is subject to high temperatures gradually becomes less resistant to 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the analogy of the tires on your car: You wouldn't wait until you have 
a blowout to replace them. A potential fire hazard (or any other safety risk 
around a house) is comparable. You should make sure it is installed right. 
</P>
<P>
There may be an identification label on the stove that lists the set-back 
requirement. If so, make sure the stove meets the label distances. If not, it 
would be best to consult a stove specialist or your local building department 
for specific requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Tell When Circuit Overloaded? 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do I translate amp or watt ratings on appliances into something more 
meaningful? 
</P>
<P>
A: The amp or watt rating allows you to judge whether you may be overloading a 
circuit with just simple arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
Household outlet circuits are rated at 15 or 20 amps. Unless you know 
otherwise, use 15 to be on the safe side. Then you can simply add up the amp 
ratings of everything you are using on a circuit to see if you're under the 
safe limit. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, you could safely use three appliances each rated at 5 amps. But 
don't forget to include all the outlets on the circuit -- such as the 
refrigerator outlet on a kitchen circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing all the outlets can be laborious, but must be done if you're pushing 
the limit. To convert appliances or fixtures that are rated in watts to amps, 
simply divide the watt rating by 120 (power (watts) = amps x volts; thus amps = 
watts divided by volts). 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a 1,000-watt appliance draws 1,000/120 = 8.33 amps. You could not 
safely use two 1,000 watt appliances on one 15 amp circuit. Typically, the 
highest amp/watt usage is appliances which heat such as heaters, toasters, 
coffee pots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Ventilation May Cause Roof Harm 
</P>
<P>
Q: My roof has asphalt shingles that are only a few years old. Many of the 
shingles are curled. What caused this, and should I be concerned? 
</P>
<P>
A: Curled shingles often indicate poor attic ventilation. The attic air becomes 
very hot unless ventilated, and this heat can damage roofing materials. Adding 
attic vents is usually fairly simple, such as through the gables or through the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
You can check for attic vents by looking into the attic for visible light. 
There should be vents at two different places to allow fresh air to flow 
through the attic. If in doubt, consult a roofing contractor to have vents 
added.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR 1,001 'POINTS OF SHADE'; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BUSH PLANTS A TREE ON THE CALIFORNIA LUTHERAN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. 
ABOUT 1,400 STUDENTS AND VISITORS HEAR HIM PRAISE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President George Bush looked out over clusters of trees on the California 
Lutheran University campus in Thousand Oaks on Saturday and called for the 
creation of "a thousand points of shade." More precisely, he added, "It's going 
to be 1,001." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments came as he planted another oak tree on the campus in a visit 
designed to highlight his environmental programs and give Republican 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson a last-minute boost before Tuesday's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Caught up in the excitement of the presidential visit, dozens of students 
camped in front of the gymnasium Friday night so they could claim spots in the 
front row of the rally for Wilson and other Republicans running for statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
About 900 students and visitors were allowed into the gymnasium, and more than 
500 were directed to an adjacent stadium to listen to Bush's remarks over 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We froze last night, but the President is worth it," said Jon Duncan, 25, a 
senior at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Catrina Wagner, another student camper, agreed. "We are in the front row, 
aren't we? This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone had to wait for a place in the front row. Wilson's gubernatorial 
campaign, a co-sponsor of the event, brought in busloads of supporters from a 
variety of ethnic groups, said Liucija Mazekeika, chairwoman of California 
Republican Heritage Groups Council in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Waving signs such as "Germans for Wilson," "Bulgarians for Wilson" and 
"American Hungarians for Wilson," many supporters came dressed in colorful 
costumes of their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to come here because Wilson has supported the issue of redress," 
said kimono-clad Beth Fujishige, president of Japanese-American Republicans 
based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson told the audience that the ethnic diversity of supporters had impressed 
the President. Wilson said Californians are proud of their mixed heritage and 
cultural variety. "Where else can you order a kosher burrito with a side order 
of sushi?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Eastern Europeans came out of gratitude for the changes that have 
taken place in the Eastern bloc. "He has helped the Hungarian people very 
much," said Elizabeth Pusztai, one of several Hungarian-Americans at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Others showed up in the hope that more can be done. "I shook his hand as he got 
off the stage and told him not to forget about Lithuania," said Viltis Jatulis, 
a Lithuanian-American. 
</P>
<P>
For others, it was enough to get close to the leader of the United States. "I'm 
here so I can tell my grandkids that I saw the President," said Dune Ives, 19, 
a sophomore at California Lutheran University. "I don't really like him," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got three inches from shaking his hand," said David Block, 13, of Thousand 
Oaks. "And he waved at Rebecca, our 20-month-old," said Jeffrey Block, David's 
father, beaming. "He must have remembered us from last night. We were waiting 
for him outside the Hyatt Westlake Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
The magic of the presidency also seemed to rub off on Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley), who beamed when Bush praised him and Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) for their help in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted to be in Elton's district," Bush told the crowd. "We need him 
back in Congress, and we need plenty more like him. And that goes for Bob 
Lagomarsino in the next district too." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Lagomarsino said he was hesitant to go to the rally after twice 
voting against the President's proposed budget agreement with Democratic 
leaders. "If he were here to talk about the budget, I probably wouldn't go so 
as not to embarrass either one of us," Lagomarsino said. "But the purpose is to 
support Pete Wilson for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gymnasium, one of Lagomarsino's opponents protested U.S. military 
intervention in the Middle East. Mindy Lorenz, the nation's first congressional 
candidate for the fledgling Green Party, said her party wants U.S. troops to 
leave the troubled region to United Nations peacekeeping forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department estimated that the event drew 150 
protesters, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to Proposition 128, 
the so-called Big Green initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The only arrest came when fourth-grade teacher Donna Schoenkopf of Thousand 
Oaks refused to obey a deputy who asked her to move away from the corner of 
Olsen Road and Campus Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenkopf, carrying a "Honk for Peace" sign, was held for an hour on a police 
bus before being released. During the arrest, she said, deputies dislocated her 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not accusing them of police brutality," she said. "I'm accusing them of 
gross ignorance of constitutional rights. We were on public property, and we 
have certain inalienable rights, such as freedom of assembly and freedom of 
speech." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the arrest, Saturday's events came off without a hitch. 
Wilson campaign officials and the White House carefully scripted every move, 
right down to the particular corner of Kingsmen Park where Bush would shovel 
dirt for the ceremonial tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got enough trees here," said Gordon Randolph Jr., director of facilities 
on campus. "We are going to move it over to the library where more people can 
see it." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Gillette, a university vice president in charge of the event, said he 
was relieved that the day had gone smoothly, but was unaware of his 
groundskeeper's plans to relocate the oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll see about that," he said. "That tree is staying put right where it is."

OXNARD WATERFRONT GETS STAR BILLING AS A GREAT ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard does not have the glitz of Hollywood nor the romance of Paris. It does 
not have the stay-up-all-night excitement of New York or the palm-tree-lined 
beaches of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ventura County's largest city has the highest unemployment rate and 
the greatest number of low-income residents in the county. Add to that a name 
that has been ridiculed almost since the city was incorporated in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
Why then have such notables as actor George Kennedy and game show host Pat 
Sajak purchased residences in the former lima bean capital? Why is Oxnard home 
to Jack Gilbert and Martin V. Smith, heads of the largest development 
corporations in the county? 
</P>
<P>
These dignitaries do not live in the Oxnard where graffiti, crime and traffic 
are daily headaches. They live in a lesser-known side of Oxnard where $56 
beluga caviar, $1-million oceanfront houses and Mercedes Benzes are common 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is one of the best-kept secrets of film producers, business executives 
and movie stars who have abandoned the smog and traffic of Los Angeles for the 
peaceful solitude of Ventura County, said Bob Krakover, a real estate agent for 
Pacific Shores Realty. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a little fed up with L.A. for various reasons," he said. "Here they 
have an ideal climate and a beautiful marina." 
</P>
<P>
Most Oxnard residents whose incomes top seven digits live in the Channel 
Islands neighborhood, where they can dock a yacht in their back yards, said 
Krakover, who specializes in selling oceanfront homes in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who is best remembered for his roles in the television series "Dallas" 
and in films such as "Cool Hand Luke" and "The Dirty Dozen," has taken up 
permanent residence in his house in Mandalay Bay, Krakover said. On the other 
hand, Sajak, the host of "Wheel of Fortune," considers his Oxnard house a 
weekend escape, Krakover said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Voth, director of the Carnegie Art Museum, said Oxnard has the 
small-town atmosphere that appeals to wealthy celebrities and business 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
He said the close-knit atmosphere has lured notables such as Geraldine Decker, 
a contralto with the New York Metropolitan Opera, and Frank Capra, who directed 
the film "It's a Wonderful Life" with James Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"They like it because it's quiet," he said. "It's like a retreat." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Robert Urich owned a waterfront house in Oxnard before moving to Boston 
about four years ago to film a television series, said his agent, Dick Guttman. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert loves anything that goes with water," he said. "That home was a great 
escape from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the celebrities left Malibu and Beverly Hills so they could own 
luxurious waterfront houses and still pay less than half what they would have 
to pay in Los Angeles County, Krakover said. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices here are far superior," he said. "We beat the hell out of Malibu, 
Huntington Beach, what have you." 
</P>
<P>
The influx of celebrities and business executives has boosted the demand for 
luxurious waterfront houses. Now it is not uncommon to sell a $1-million 
6,000-square-foot waterfront house, Krakover said. "For Oxnard this was almost 
unheard of about a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, president of TOLD Corp., owns a two-story, waterfront house in the 
Mandalay Bay neighborhood. He said he was born in Los Angeles but moved to 
Oxnard six years ago to take advantage of the lower property costs and has 
"never been happier." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pleasantness with the people," he said. "You can go into a store 
and everyone is just nice." 
</P>
<P>
While Oxnard may never appear in an episode of "Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous," it can still provide plenty of opportunities for the well-to-do to 
spend their bankrolls. 
</P>
<P>
There are three yacht clubs in the Channel Islands marina. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pacific Corinthian Yacht Club, the largest in the marina, membership 
costs $5,000, plus monthly dues of about $100, a spokeswoman said. Members have 
access to a pool, spa, laundry services and 180-foot guest dock. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Butler, a member of the Anacapa Yacht Club, said monthly dock fees in the 
marina are about $7 a foot. For a 50-foot boat, that adds up to about $4,200 a 
year in fees. 
</P>
<P>
For the VIPs who suffer seasickness, there is the River Ridge Golf Course, a 
city-owned course in Oxnard frequented by football great and actor Dick Butkus 
and former child actor Brandon Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Membership fees to the River Ridge Men's Club are $65 a year, which doesn't 
include green fees and cart rental, but provides members the right to reserve a 
tee time on the 18-hole course one week in advance. There is also a women's 
club and a seniors' club. 
</P>
<P>
While night life for the average Oxnard resident may include a bag of popcorn 
and a first-run movie, celebrities and business executives can join the Tower 
Club, one of the county's most exclusive and luxurious clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the 22-story Union Bank Building, the Tower Club was recently the site of 
fund-raising parties for gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The club's membership includes dignitaries such as Mayor Nao Takasugi, Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens. 
</P>
<P>
At a cost of $50 a month, members have access to the club's gym, which includes 
a sauna and a upright tanning booth and is staffed by a massage therapist, a 
physical fitness trainer, a tennis pro and a manicurist. 
</P>
<P>
After a invigorating workout, members enjoy a meal in the dining hall, which 
provides a scenic view of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The menu's delicacies include beluga caviar for $56, a papaya and bay shrimp 
salad with citrus sauce for $10.95 and Cote D' Agneau Mousseline De Legume 
(lamb chops in vegetable and chicken sauce), a $26 entree.

WHITE-COLLAR CRIMES BECOME A PRIORITY FOR COUNTY FBI AGENTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: OF 10 SATELLITE OFFICES IN SEVEN COUNTIES, THE ONE IN VENTURA 
IS THE MOST POPULAR AMONG OPERATIVES. 
</P>

<P>
Two Ventura businesses had been swindled out of more than $16 million, and 
Naomi Jerez was on the run in Guatemala, when she was lured back to the country 
in 1986 and arrested for bank fraud by Ventura County agents of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of John Stephen Wilson, the crime was industrial espionage. He was 
arrested by two undercover FBI agents at a Ventura restaurant in 1988, after he 
tried to sell them secrets about a new drug being developed by a Thousand Oaks 
company. 
</P>
<P>
And last year, the FBI's Ventura office moved into action again -- this time in 
a major defense fraud inquiry triggered by a tip from a worker at a Simi Valley 
defense plant who said his company was falsifying test data about missile 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
Those three cases -- among the most significant that federal agents have worked 
in Ventura County in recent years -- typify the complex white-collar crime 
investigations that have become top priority for the 10 agents in the FBI's 
Ventura office over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Most citizens don't have an accurate perception of what the FBI does," said 
Gary Auer, head of the FBI's Ventura office. "Even those who are generally 
familiar with law enforcement perceive us as we were 15 to 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Auer said, the FBI's priorities were less complicated, focusing 
on kidnapings, organized crime cases and the pursuit of bank robbers and others 
on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
While the FBI still works such cases, the Ventura office has turned more of its 
attention toward white-collar cases such as defense fraud and bank failures in 
the past five years, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Five of Ventura County's investigative agents work exclusively on white-collar 
crimes. The other agents handle a variety of assignments ranging from bank 
robberies to assorted crimes on the area's military bases. 
</P>
<P>
The office also works counterintelligence cases, which typically include 
debriefing county residents after they meet officials from the Soviet Union to 
determine whether Soviet intelligence is trying to recruit Americans, Auer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden away in an office building across the street from a Ventura shopping 
complex, the Ventura County resident agency is, among operatives, the most 
popular of 10 similar satellite offices in the seven-county Central District of 
California, all of which report to the FBI's Los Angeles headquarters in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The list of FBI applicants waiting for a vacancy in Ventura exceeds that of any 
other of the branch offices that report to Los Angeles, Auer said. One benefit 
of the popularity is that the Ventura office has a higher concentration of 
veteran agents than any of the FBI's other area offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura office's appeal stems from the fact that about 75 of the 300 agents 
assigned to the Westwood office live in Ventura County and would prefer not to 
make the commute anymore, Auer said. Many agents moved to the county in the 
1970s, when houses were cheaper than in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Bill Pemberton, 49, said he transferred from the Westwood office in 1982 
because of the commute from his home in Newbury Park and the hassle of 
traveling on the job in the Los Angeles area. Agents now working in Los Angeles 
often tell him they wish for a shot at the Ventura locale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'When are you going to retire so we can have a chance to take your 
place?' " Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura office was opened in the early 1950s, when it was determined that 
the county was growing and so was crime, said Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
James S. Irving, who once worked for the FBI and headed the Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
The office went through several transformations, moving from Ventura to the 
Seabee Base at Port Hueneme, then to Oxnard and back to Ventura during the 
following decades. It even shut down briefly in 1971, when a break-in at a 
similar regional office in Pennsylvania caused concern that small offices were 
not secure. 
</P>
<P>
After the office reopened, the staffing level stayed at three to five agents 
for years, Auer said. It wasn't until the mid-1980s that the Ventura office 
began to grow, as the FBI shifted its priorities to white-collar crime cases. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Auer said, he recently submitted a request to Los Angeles for more 
agents in Ventura. But he must compete with other regional FBI supervisors for 
a limited number of employees. The battle is fought by getting convictions on 
important cases, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The office is considered a success if it brings home a few major-impact 
cases," Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
One such case is Agent Ted Bowler's continuing inquiry into the downfall of 
Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan and its parent company, United Community Bank of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Five people have been indicted and sentenced to prison terms already in what is 
now a two-year investigation, and more are targeted for prosecution in the 
large-scale fraud scheme, which was brought to the FBI's attention locally when 
California Highway Patrol officers in San Bernardino County complained to the 
Riverside district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 CHP officers had let Riverside businessman Walter Vladovich use their 
names on loan applications to his mortgage firm, Pioneer Acceptance Corp., so 
he could get money that was tied up and use it for another company that he 
owned, Leder Video. Vladovich told the officers that he needed access to the 
money to build his empire of 100 video stores, Bowler said. Vladovich 
guaranteed to make the $200 monthly payments on the loans and offered the 
officers $1,000 each in televisions and videocassette recorders for the use of 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
But in reality, Vladovich, working in consort with bank officials, submitted 
the loan packages, each requesting $5,350, to Westlake Thrift, telling the bank 
it was on behalf of people who were going to launch their own video store 
businesses, Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute classic case," said Bowler, whose 12 file cabinets full of 
Westlake Thrift documents are stashed throughout the Ventura office. "It's the 
kind of case an agent dreams of having." 
</P>
<P>
Bowler, 48, an affable man with an easy laugh, joined the FBI 21 years ago, 
assuming that he would spend most of his career fighting the Mafia in organized 
crime cases. But Bowler -- whose career has included interviewing Ku Klux Klan 
members in the South and working with Hollywood stars on copyright cases -- 
says he is now happy dealing instead with white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fill in the blanks," Bowler said. "It becomes a real battle of wits." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Jerez case in the early 1980s that established Bowler as a lead 
investigator in savings and loan failures. 
</P>
<P>
Jerez sold people on a plan to transport apartment buildings from high-priced 
areas of Los Angeles -- where they were scheduled to be torn down and replaced 
with bigger buildings -- to South-Central Los Angeles for federally subsidized 
housing, Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
She received $8.5 million from Hacienda Federal Savings and Loan in Oxnard, $8 
million from Financial Planning Consultants Inc. of Thousand Oaks and $6.5 
million from Orecal of Portland, Ore., Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
As money rolled in, buildings stopped getting moved, Bowler said. But Jerez 
continued to lead an extravagant lifestyle, treating 40 business associates to 
a $1,000-a-plate dinner for President Ronald Reagan and flying people to San 
Francisco for business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Her scam, which began in 1982, went well for a year and a half before officials 
caught on and she fled the country, Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hacienda Federal Savings and Loan was seized by the federal 
government. Financial Planning Consultants Inc. and Orecal went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
A promise from an undercover FBI agent that he could launder millions of 
dollars for Jerez lured her back to the United States, and she was arrested 
when she arrived to pick up some of the money. Convicted in 1985, Jerez is 
serving a 10-year sentence at Geiger Correctional Institute in Seattle, Wash., 
Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the FBI's major cases in Ventura County was a defense fraud 
investigation that was led by Pemberton in 1987, after a former employee of the 
Simi Valley-based transducer products division of Genisco Technology Corp. 
contacted agents to tell them that transducers, which are used to guide 
missiles, were not being properly tested. 
</P>
<P>
An inside informant then came forward, feeding the FBI detailed information on 
the company, which was using an Atari computer to generate false data and 
presenting it to the government and Texas Instruments, Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
The transducers, cylinder-shaped devices about an inch long, help control the 
altitude of Hi-Speed Anti-RADAR Missiles, which are designed to go in and knock 
out enemy radar so that fighter pilots following them are in less danger of 
attack, Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It caused a critical weapons system to be in doubt," Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments was forced to recall some of the missiles and have them 
retrofitted. Last year, Genisco's plant manager, production supervisor and a 
quality-control employee were convicted. Genisco Technology Corp., 
headquartered in La Mirada, was fined $750,000. The corporation is still in 
business, but the transducer division was sold, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Pemberton said he has worked defense fraud cases in Ventura that are as "good 
or better than most in Los Angeles." In addition, the working conditions are 
more relaxed in Ventura, because traveling throughout the county is easier, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The selection process for getting a spot in Ventura is based, in part, on 
expertise and seniority, Auer said. The result is an office of older white 
males, all with at least 15 years experience. 
</P>
<P>
Auer himself is a 19-year veteran of the FBI. His last position was as head of 
the Soviet counterintelligence squad in Los Angeles, where he was thrown into 
the national limelight during the Richard W. Miller espionage case. Miller, the 
first FBI agent ever found guilty of spying for the Soviets, was on Auer's 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
The trials in the Miller case revealed that it was only after Auer took over 
the Soviet squad that the FBI had begun a serious effort to fire Miller for 
gross incompetence. Nonetheless, the machinery did not move fast enough, and 
Miller remained an agent until minutes before his arrest as a spy in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
About a year after the second Miller trial -- the first ended in a hung jury -- 
Auer was transferred to Ventura. FBI officials said the transfer had nothing to 
do with the Miller case and was part of a usual rotation aimed at giving 
middle-management supervisors a broader background. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Auer, two other agents in the office have supervisory 
backgrounds, and nine out of 10 live in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The agents -- who earn between $55,000 and $60,000 a year -- are expected to be 
on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average workweek is 49 hours 
long, and all take home government cars in case they are called out in the 
middle of the night for an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Larry Dick, an 18-year FBI veteran who investigates bank robberies, 
carries a Sheriff's Department radio in his car so he can listen for robberies 
and respond quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Dick said he works the cases with the police and uses a network of informants 
to help in identifying bank robbers. He said he also relies on photographs 
taken during the robberies and on exploding dye packs, which are hidden in 
stacks of $20 bills. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 of the office's 186 open cases are bank robberies. The office, 
which has joint investigative jurisdiction with local authorities on bank 
robberies, has a success rate of convicting between 85% and 90% of its cases 
per year, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FBI works closely with local law enforcement agencies on 
drug-forfeiture cases and is sometimes called upon to investigate those 
agencies when there are allegations of civil-rights violations by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County resident agency has investigated about 40 civil-rights cases 
in the past five years, Auer said. Not one of those investigations has led to 
prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the office investigated a Ventura police officer who used a stun gun 
on an epileptic who had suffered a seizure and caused a minor traffic accident 
on June 23. The office also looked into the allegations of an Oxnard man who 
claimed that he and several other guests at a private party on June 15 were 
beaten by Oxnard police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Auer said it is sometimes an uneasy role for the FBI to be a peer of the police 
departments in most matters and to be their watchdog on civil-rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be natural for any law enforcement official to have a negative 
attitude toward the federal investigation of their agency or actions of one of 
their members," Auer said. "However, in the case of chiefs in this county, they 
recognize federal responsibilities and have been supportive of the 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
Both Auer and local police officials said working relationships are smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"In a small office with 10 agents, we, the FBI, are not the solution to the 
crime problem in Ventura County," Auer said. "We see our mission here as a 
productive part of the overall law enforcement."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 228 to 200, the House approved the conference report on budget 
legislation (HR 5835) aimed at slowing deficit growth by about $490 billion 
over five years. Democrats voted 181 for and 74 against, and Republicans 47 for 
and 126 against. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would improve but not cure America's deficit 
problem. For example, red ink this fiscal year is projected to top $200 billion 
even after the bill trims it by $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue side of HR 5835 is estimated at about $189 billion. Upper-income 
taxpayers will supply most of the tax yield as a result of curbs on their 
deductions and personal exemptions. Most other Americans will be touched by 
higher taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and airline tickets, 
an expansion of the wage base for Medicare payroll taxes and other revenue 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
A defense slowdown of about $185 billion over five years is the bill's major 
spending restraint. Medicare curbs are estimated at $44 billion, about $10 
billion of which will hit beneficiaries. Spending growth is curbed by $12 
billion for farm subsidies, $7.6 billion for civil servant retirement benefits 
and $3.7 billion for veterans' benefits, among other restraints. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to join the bipartisan leadership and President Bush in support 
of the deficit-reduction bill.

THE THIN MAN AND JAMES BOND AGREE: WHEN IT COMES TO A PROPER MARTINI, IT'S 
SHAKE, NEVER STIR.

The secret of a Big League curve ball? It's all in the wrist. But for a 
first-rate martini pitcher it's all in the hips, if you believe William Powell, 
or rather his incarnation as Nick Charles, raffish sleuth of "The Thin Man" and 
the silver screen's cocktail expert. Indeed, when movie audiences first meet 
Nick Charles, he's holding court in a swanky gin mill. The camera pans the room 
of sophisticated revelers, and in the corner of the club, next to the bar, we 
notice a man gleefully dancing, not with a woman but with a cocktail shaker. 
He's instructing the tuxedoed bartenders on the perfect martini beat. 
</P>
<P>
"See, the important thing is the rhythm," he says, never missing a step. "Now a 
Manhattan, you shake to fox-trot time. A Bronx, to two-step time. But a dry 
martini you always shake to waltz time." 
</P>
<P>
Then he pours the mixture into a waiting glass, olive ready, and with a 
flourish places the glass on a silver tray. It is immediately served back to 
him. He lifts the glass to his nose, savors the fumes and downs the thing. He's 
his own best customer. 
</P>
<P>
You aren't likely to find such a character in today's movies. It'd spoil the 
image of such modern heroes as John Rambo or Dirty Harry to be seen dancing 
with anything less lethal than a .44 magnum. But in the Golden Age of 
Hollywood, the only magnums shot were the kind that held Champagne. In 
celebrations, scenes of young love or tableaux of the haut monde, Champagne was 
a star. It was also a handy plot device. 
</P>
<P>
In "Ninotchka," Greta Garbo tastes the joys of capitalism with her first glass 
of the bubbly and is hooked. In "The Philadelphia Story," several glasses of 
Champagne (or as Cary Grant's character calls it, "the great leveler") jostle 
Katharine Hepburn off her high horse just long enough to make her realize she's 
about to marry the wrong man. Walt Disney's Dumbo even discovers that he can 
fly under the influence of the fizzy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But as a dramatic prop, the cocktail is more versatile than Champagne: 
Sophistication, seediness or loneliness can all be determined by a character's 
call at the bar. Cocktail parties were all the rage in the '30s and '40s (all 
that industrial-strength Prohibition hooch cried out for mixers, and the 
tradition stuck). The smartest couple on the screen always had a well-stocked 
bar, and the leading man's better half was expected to be a sport and keep up 
with the boys -- Myrna Loy as Nora Charles, finding hubby Nick sipping his 
sixth martini, promptly orders six for herself. "Line 'em up," she tells the 
waiter. 
</P>
<P>
In "Casablanca," Humphrey Bogart is the hero most remember, but Paul Henreid 
got the girl and the most interesting drinks. Bogey spends most of the film 
drowning his sorrows in bourbon, straight. But when the very together Henreid 
escorts Ingrid Bergman to Rick's place, he orders Cointreau and, later in the 
evening, a Champagne cocktail (usually made with a dash of angostura bitters, 
sugar and a twist of lemon). The next night Henreid drinks cognac. It's only 
when talking man-to-man with Bogey that he drinks whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
A man of sophistication doesn't simply drink well; he knows how to mix a drink, 
too. This invaluable talent rightfully impresses Carole Lombard's well-to-do 
family in "My Man Godfrey." William Powell (yes, again) as Godfrey charms the 
lady of the house with a concoction called a Bloody Angeli ca that manages to 
cure the hangover of the Angelica in question. Godfrey calls his drink "a 
focusing agent" and is elusive about its ingredients. However, we learn that it 
involves a pinch of mustard and, like a Bloody Mary, tomato juice. (Angelica 
tells Godfrey: "You can run amok on the vodka.") Godfrey scores points with a 
European socialite (Eva Gabor) when he recalls her drink: French vermouth with 
a dash of cassis and a soda chaser. 
</P>
<P>
As the '50s began, Hollywood's love affair with cocktails was showing signs of 
strain. In "All About Eve," Bette Davis' character prefers her Scotch straight. 
At one point someone offers Davis' Margo Channing a bottle of soda water to mix 
with her drink, only to be met by the steely gaze of those infamous Bette Davis 
eyes. As Joseph Mankiewicz, the film's Oscar-winning director and screenwriter, 
put it in the script: "She looks at it (the soda bottle) and at him, as if it 
were a tarantula and he had gone mad." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Davis throws a big bash but serves her guests inferior liquor. When the 
bartender asks, "Does Miss Channing know she ordered domestic gin by mistake?" 
Davis retorts, "The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're 
domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns." 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Apartment," made in 1960, shows the "martooni" (as one character 
calls it) still going strong enough, the film features libations that would 
have made Nick Charles reach for his gun: frozen daiquiris in a Chinese 
restaurant, the deservedly obscure rum collins, and a Tom and Jerry made with 
hot whiskey (or bourbon), eggs, sugar, Jamaican rum, cinnamon, cloves and hot 
milk. Ray Walston (pre-Martian) brings his own, arriving by cab to Jack 
Lemmon's pad armed with his mistress and four long-stemmed glasses filled to 
the brim with the vile brandy and creme de menthe mixture known as a stinger. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the cocktail, while surviving, had lost its classic reserve. As the 
'60s progressed, the cocktail was mostly used as date aid for bachelors on the 
make. Meanwhile, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" didn't really care what they drank as long as there was ice. 
By the time "A Clockwork Orange" was made -- its futuristic Korova Milkbar, 
served not liquor, but drug-spiked milk -- the cocktail was in big trouble. 
Fortunately a few good drinking men were still around -- suave, sophisticated 
men who could hold their liquor with style: men like James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his creator, Ian Fleming, 007 has perhaps the most detailed drinking 
preferences of all of Hollywood's star characters. Not only should a James Bond 
dry martini be shaken (never stirred despite the fact that shaking will cause 
the ice to start melting), it should be served in a deep Champagne goblet. In 
"Casino Royale" Fleming gives the exact recipe for the perfect Bond martini: 
three measures of Gordon's gin, one of vodka, and half a measure of Kina 
Lillet, shaken until ice-cold, and served topped with a large, thin slice of 
lemon peel. Unfortunately for easily disillusioned Bond fans, martini experts 
point out that Kina Lillet has quinine in it and would tend to make a martini 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bond's favorite alternatives is bourbon on the rocks -- Old Grand Dad, 
Walker's Deluxe or I. W. Harper, please. He's also partial to old fashioneds 
and Negronis (1/3 gin, 1/3 Campari and 1/3 red Cinzano). In outdoor cafes, say 
in Paris, Bond shuns vodka, whiskey and gin. Although Pernod is proper for such 
an occasion, legend has it that Bond won't drink the stuff because the licorice 
taste reminds him of his childhood. Instead, he drinks Americanos (Campari, 
Cinzano, soda and a large slice of lemon peel) while dining alfresco. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, James Bond cannot single-handedly save the world for cocktail 
fans, and frankly, it's much easier for bartender-less party hosts if their 
guests drink beer, wine, or the hard stuff straight or on the rocks. The 
obvious drift is toward the simpler drinks. Except for the occasional vamp, 
that's what we're seeing on the screen. But if you long for the concoctions of 
former days, we recommend Hollywood's Musso and Frank. It's benefits: a 
star-studded clientele (many from the good old days); movie-set decor (real 
red-leather booths), and a bartender who never forgets a face. Here Hollywood's 
Golden Age lives on -- and the martini is still king.

People in California have always known how to throw a party. In this issue we 
celebrate the state's tradition of entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Our authors reminisce about the way things were. A granddaughter remembers the 
barbacoas on the last rancho in California. California's greatest cook recalls 
beach parties, abalone hunts and grunion runs in the '40s. In the '50s, a 
restaurant critic remembers waking up to find Ruby Keeler dancing in his living 
room. In the '60s, the best parties in town were Sunday-night suppers at the 
home of Roz and Gene Wyman. In the '80s, famous chefs threw potluck parties for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the '90s, the tradition continues. Come join the party.

CALIFORNIA ONCE HAD DUENDE -- THE MYSTERIOUS ESSENCE THAT MAKES SOMETHING 
SPANISH. IT CAME TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE EARLY SETTLERS. MY 
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS AMONG THEM. 
</P>
<P>
He was granted a rancho by King Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1821, but during my 
childhood it was spoken of as if it had happened only yesterday. Like that of 
the other soldados who came through Mexico to conquer California, his rancho 
was a vast holding with boundaries defined only by oak trees, stream beds and 
distinctive rocks. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there were only the ranchos and the missions. Occasionally a 
foreigner filtered in through the mountains or a passing ship stopped, but they 
were rare. Within this glorious isolation, the old Californios tried to 
recreate Spain from what they chose to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Their food customs were flagrantly borrowed from the Indians and from the 
people they had known during their time in Mexico. They made it all theirs and 
called it Spanish. Grandma always insisted that the huge flour tortillas she 
stretched with her fingers were Spanish. Years later, when I grew up and 
traveled to Mexico, I was shocked to find the same tortillas in Sonora. 
Grandmama had made a very convincing case that they were from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
With their roots foremost in their minds, my ancestors subscribed to an acute 
sense of honor and prided themselves on their graces. The courtesies of life 
were so intertwined with the ceremonies of food as to be inseparable. There was 
an old saying, "It is better to arrive on time than to be invited." Nobody was 
ever turned away. In Walter Colton's 1850 diary of life in Monterey, he notes 
that "were the Devil himself to call for a night's lodging, the Californian 
would hardly find it in his heart to bolt the door but would think he could 
manage in some way." 
</P>
<P>
I can remember my grandmother being surprised by guests when her larder was 
empty. A white cloth suddenly appeared on the table, and then teacups with hot 
chocolate. A bowl of jelly was found in some forgotten jar. Stale soda crackers 
were crisped in the oven. Slices of cheese were displayed in the English cheese 
dish that was a family heirloom. A small bunch of red grapes was put out with 
the grape scissors, and some candy. The guests were astonished at the silent 
appearance of the little dishes. No apologies were made for the simple fare. 
</P>
<P>
The courtesies lingered. There was a short period of about 25 years during the 
last century that encapsulated all the romance associated with Old California. 
The Californio had a complete disregard for money and the need to work for it. 
It was not unusual for a ranchero to stage a barbecue rather than drive his 
cattle to market so that he could make payment on a loan. This was frowned upon 
by most Anglo-Saxons, who were shocked by such laziness; most written accounts 
by Anglos fume over the fact that people with such natural wealth could be so 
profligate as to prefer dining alfresco when they could be doing something more 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
So while land robbers and loan sharks and Yankee businessmen pressed in upon 
them, the Californios dined. And lost almost everything. My family ended up 
with about 20 acres of the thousands of the original land grant. All they had 
left was their food, their dining -- and their style. 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine is too grand a word to describe the food served on the ranchos. When I 
first moved far away from home, dazzled by French cooking and Julia Child, I 
was struck by how simple our food was. But there was a perfection in that 
simplicity; I couldn't even make a pot of beans the way my grandmother and 
mother did. 
</P>
<P>
The most important word in the cook's vocabulary, and one for which there is no 
translation, is guisar : It will never taste flat. I still fear the thought of 
cooking a meal for my Spanish uncle; for him and also for my grandfather, a 
dish is never guisado. It always needed a pinch more of basil, or pepper, or 
salt. Or less salt. 
</P>
<P>
My father, who was raised on a Wisconsin dairy farm, never recovered from the 
shock of my mother's family. Brought up to believe that food was meant to be 
eaten quickly, he hated the long after-dinner discussions about whether the 
lamb marinade had contained enough rosemary. When I was 5, one of my uncles 
asked what I thought of a fresh batch of olives. Knowing a reply was important, 
I told him they weren't salty enough. My father looked at me like I was headed 
for hell. 
</P>
<P>
Exquisite attention was paid to the smallest details of daily life. Although 
their repertoire was not extensive, the women were all good cooks and loved 
tending the herbs so important to the rancho dishes. Gardens were stocked with 
yerba buena (mint), cilantro, Italian parsley, chamomile, sweet basil and 
anise, and we grew an ancient stock of wild marjoram (oregano) that was 
marvelously sweet and pungent but not bitter. The cooks used herbs in vegetable 
stews, marinades, salads and in curative brews such as chamomile tea. Grandma 
always added slivers of sweet basil to her famous corn pie. 
</P>
<P>
Besides herbs, one of the most distinctive features of rancho cooking was the 
use of olive oil. Since most of the ranchos pressed their own olives into oil, 
they used it for frying instead of lard. Salads were always simply iceberg 
lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers anointed with droplets of olive oil, red wine 
vinegar, salt, and finely ground pepper out of a can. My grandmother even 
blended olive oil and sea salt and gave it to me as the most ungodly cough 
syrup known to man. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking was not considered women's work. The men loved knowing about every 
detail; when it came to barbecue, they took over completely. The asador was 
even more important: Any man could oversee the parillas (grills), but only a 
man of experience could hold sway over the stone-lined pits where large chunks 
of beef shoulder or a whole bull's head were roasted. My grandfather relished 
this role. 
</P>
<P>
First, the asador chose the meat. Then he and his compadres watched over the 
fires that were built at least 12 hours in advance so there was a deep bed of 
glowing coals. Then he dictated the gathering of the shovels, wheelbarrows, 
sheet iron, soaked gunny sacks and the necessary libations for his cronies. 
Lastly, he went somewhere to mix up his secret blend of herbs and spices and 
his own basting sauce. He never revealed his recipe (even if it was just salt, 
pepper and wine), not even to his wife. During his moments at the barbecue, the 
asador reigned supreme. He was the most opinionated man you ever met. 
</P>
<P>
The morning of a barbecue, the dirt pathways that meandered through fig trees, 
olive trees, oaks, and flower pots of geraniums were swept and tidied with 
palm-frond brooms. The long tables near the grape arbor were covered with white 
cloths and anchored with more pots of flowers. The fires were built using 
fruitwood and vine cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
The menu hardly varied. The meat was beef or lamb. Chicken was reserved for 
invalids. Huge pots of thick pink beans were cooked in the same way that they 
had been for a hundred years. Beans were always rolled into a triangle of 
tortilla and they had to be thick enough so the juices did not run down your 
sleeve. (The only other place I have found these thick beans is in the little 
restaurant on Olvera Street across from the bandstand.) 
</P>
<P>
The necessary accompaniment to barbecued meats was sarsa, a rancho version of 
salsa, a mixture of tomatoes, green chilies, onions, garlic and cilantro. The 
cook might add a dash of olive oil, wine vinegar, salt and finely ground 
pepper. Sarsa is not incendiary but a relish that can be put on everything -- 
barbecued meat, beans and numerous warm flour tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
It was absolutely essential that there be many long pans of red enchiladas to 
accompany the meat as well. First, the thin, hand-stretched flour tortillas had 
to be made while the red chili sauce simmered. Several pounds of onions had to 
be chopped and slowly simmered. The combination of the hot red chili with the 
sweet onion filling is one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Pilillis are another of the Californios' culinary inventions. The word, like 
sarsa, is untraceable, but pilillis are remarkably similar to sopaipillas, the 
puffy fried bread of the Southwest. Anyone who came for one of the great Sunday 
barbecues and snuggled into one of the ghostly rooms of the old ranch house for 
the night would wake up the next morning to the smell of pilillis and 
dark-roasted coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, when the embers of the great barbecue were dying, they carried out huge 
platters holding wedges of watermelon; if peaches or apricots were in season, 
Aunt Nicolassa and Mama baked at least a dozen pies. 
</P>
<P>
After a barbecue, nobody wanted to go home. They sat at the long tables 
chatting until Grandmama carried out the kerosene lamps. They did not want to 
let go of the day. They sat in the dark, their image of the rancho intact, as 
if they were still surrounded by thousands of acres. There in the ambiente of 
the grape arbor, they had dined like royalty on tortillas, beans, and 
enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs, garlic, finely ground pepper and red wine were used as marinades for 
barbecued meats. Fresh rosemary was a favorite with lamb and I have substituted 
pomegranate juice for the red wine for a less harsh but fruitier flavor. 
</P>
<P>
BUTTERFLIED LAMB IN ROSEMARY AND POMEGRANATE JUICE 
</P>
<P>
1 (5-to-6-pound) leg of lamb, boned and butterflied 
</P>
<P>
6 cloves garlic, cut into slivers 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fresh rosemary leaves, bruised to release 
</P>
<P>
herb oils 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 cups pomegranate juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Sprigs fresh rosemary 
</P>
<P>
Barbecued Peppers 
</P>
<P>
Cut slits on both sides of meat and fill with garlic slivers. Trim off all fat 
from meat, but thin film of fell may be left intact. 
</P>
<P>
Place meat in shallow dish and rub with 1/4 cup rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 
teaspoon pepper. Add pomegranate juice. Marinate 6 hours in refrigerator, 
turning meat occasionally so marinade penetrates evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Remove meat from refrigerator 1 hour before grilling. Build fire of hardwood 
briquettes, almond wood or fruitwood. When coals are covered with white ash, 
rub lamb with olive oil and grill 5 to 6 inches above coals about 20 minutes 
per side for rare and 30 minutes per side for medium rare, or to 135 degrees on 
meat thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
During last 10 minutes of grilling, toss a couple sprigs of rosemary on coals. 
Herbal oils released into smoke will flavor lamb. Sprinkle with more salt and 
pepper just before removing meat from grill. 
</P>
<P>
Allow meat to rest at least 10 minutes before slicing crosswise. Place slices 
on platter garnished with more rosemary sprigs and Barbecued Peppers. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Have butcher bone and butterfly lamb. Pomegranate juice may be purchased 
at health-food stores. A can of water and a short stick with cloth tied at one 
end can be used to drizzle water over any flare-ups that could blacken meat 
during grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetables to accompany the lamb should be sweet and simple. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecued Peppers 
</P>
<P>
2 sweet red peppers 
</P>
<P>
2 green peppers 
</P>
<P>
4 Anaheim chiles 
</P>
<P>
2 poblano chiles 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2-3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
During last 20 minutes of grilling lamb, place red and green peppers and 
Anaheim and poblano chiles alongside meat on grill. Turn peppers and chiles 
every 2-3 minutes until evenly charred. 
</P>
<P>
Mash garlic with salt and whisk in olive oil. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Remove peppers and chiles, place in large brown shopping bag and fold over top. 
Let steam 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Remove peppers and chiles and use small, sharp knife to peel off most of 
blackened skins, leaving some black flecks for character. Cut peppers and 
chiles into halves, remove cores and seeds and drizzle with garlic olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
These are the ones Grandmama called Spanish. They are rolled and then 
hand-stretched. They call for much less fat than many of the thick flour 
tortillas requiring lard. You will only enjoy these at the table of a rancho 
family or your own. In the old days, there could not be a barbecue without 
flour tortillas in which to roll up meat, salsa and thick beans. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO FLOUR TORTILLAS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups warm water 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup shortening, about 
</P>
<P>
4 cups unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
Dissolve salt in warm water and set aside. Cut shortening into flour and baking 
powder with pastry blender until mealy. Finish by using fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly add just enough warm salted water to make dough form soft ball. Knead 1 
minute in bowl. Cover ball of dough with plastic wrap and let rest 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 12 pieces and form into balls. Place on greased pan. Flatten 
each ball with heel of hand. Let balls rest, covered with plastic wrap, 30-45 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Heat griddle or comal over medium flame. Roll out first tortilla on lightly 
floured surface with 7-inch sawed-off broom handle or dowel. Roll in quick, 
short strokes, and keep lifting and turning tortilla to retain even circle. 
When tortilla is about 8 inches wide, hang from 1 hand and draw fingers of 
other hand across bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Cook on grill about 1 minute, turning tortilla every 10 seconds. To turn, push 
thumb into edge of tortilla and turn over. Tortilla will develop golden spots 
and puff. Tortilla is cooked when puffing ceases. Wrap in towel, then foil. 
Makes 12 tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a salsa that must be hand-chopped. 
</P>
<P>
SARSA 
</P>
<P>
5 tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
4 Anaheim chiles 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet onion (Bermuda or Vidalia) 
</P>
<P>
2 jalapeno chiles, seeded 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup snipped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
Cut tomatoes in halves and squeeze out seeds. Char Anaheim chiles over flame. 
Cool, then remove skins, seeds and stems. 
</P>
<P>
Dice tomatoes, Anaheim chiles and onion. Mince jalapeno chiles and garlic. Stir 
together tomatoes, Anaheim and jalapeno chiles, onion, garlic, vinegar, olive 
oil, salt to taste, marjoram and cilantro. Marinate at least 1 hour before 
serving. Makes about 5 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 When I tried to cook these beans from memory, complicating them with gourmet 
tricks, I failed miserably. How could something so utterly basic as beans, 
water and salt be so difficult? It is all in the patience needed for the second 
simmering -- and the mashing. Use a big spoon, not a blender as is sometimes 
recommended. It is just as necessary to cook the beans in a humble, cheap pot 
instead of one that cost you $75. These beans were eaten twice a day on the 
ranchos; they were always pink. 
</P>
<P>
THICK RANCHO BEANS 
</P>
<P>
1 pound pink beans 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground New Mexican chile powder 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons canola oil or bacon fat 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
Wash beans in sieve and pick over for stones. Cover beans with water, bring to 
boil and simmer 3 minutes. Let beans soak at least 2 hours. Drain off soaking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Cover beans with 6 cups fresh water, onion, garlic and chile powder. Bring to 
boil, then reduce heat and simmer 2 hours or until tender but not mushy. (Beans 
may also be cooked in pressure cooker 50 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large cast-iron pan. Add 1/2 cup beans and small amount of bean 
liquid. When mixture starts to bubble, mash beans with back of large spoon. 
</P>
<P>
When mixture thickens add another 1/2 cup beans and bean liquid. Simmer, then 
again begin mashing beans. Do not add too much bean liquid at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
Keep adding beans slowly, and gradually add liquid. Simmer 10 to 20 minutes or 
until beans are desired degree of thickness. Do not mash all beans, but just 
enough to make mixture thick. 
</P>
<P>
Add salt and pepper to taste. Beans thicken upon standing, so reserve some of 
bean liquor to add later. Makes 6 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Any leftover beans may be refried. Heat cast-iron pan with 2-3 
tablespoons oil or bacon fat, and fry beans until crisp around edges. Sprinkle 
with grated Parmesan cheese, or stir in cubes of Jack cheese. Serve with huevos 
rancheros. 
</P>
<P>
 These are two typical and popular rancho barbecue dishes. 
</P>
<P>
RED ENCHILADAS 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
5 medium onions, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 cups Red Chile Sauce 
</P>
<P>
10 flour tortillas, preferably homemade 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded 
</P>
<P>
1 (6-ounce) can pitted black olives, halved 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in large skillet and saute onions slowly 20-30 minutes, stirring 
frequently to prevent sticking. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Warm Red Chile Sauce and place 1/2 cup sauce on wide dinner plate. Dip both 
sides of tortilla into sauce. Place scant 1/2 cup cheese, 4 olive halves and 
scant 1/2 cup sauteed onion down center. Fold each side of tortilla over 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Place each enchilada, folded edges down, in oiled 4-quart rectangular baking 
dish. Pour remaining chile sauce over top. Sprinkle with remaining olives and 
shredded cheese. Bake enchiladas at 350 degrees 20 minutes or until heated 
through. Makes 10 enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Red Chile Sauce 
</P>
<P>
10 dried red California or New Mexican chiles 
</P>
<P>
6 pasilla chiles 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, mashed 
</P>
<P>
1/2 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Rinse California and pasilla chiles. Break off stems and shake out seeds. Place 
chiles in 5-quart sauce pot with garlic and onion. Cover with 12 cups water and 
simmer 30 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Puree chiles, garlic and onion in blender in 3 batches using about 1/2 cup 
cooking water for each batch. Add more water if puree is too thick. Press puree 
through sieve to remove chile skins. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in skillet; stir in flour. Add oregano. Heat until golden brown, then 
stir in chile puree and vinegar. Simmer sauce 20 minutes. If sauce seems thick, 
add additional cooking liquid. Season to taste with salt. Makes about 4 1/2 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
 These pastry clouds are dusted with powdered sugar just like the beignets of 
New Orleans. They are best eaten for breakfast when you are wearing a white 
bathrobe! 
</P>
<P>
PILLILIS 
</P>
<P>
3 cups unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup vegetable shortening 
</P>
<P>
1 (13-ounce) can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
2 cups canola oil 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Using pastry blender or fingers, 
work shortening into mixture until texture resembles coarse meal. Warm 
evaporated milk to 95 degrees, and slowly add to mixture to produce dough of 
soft consistency. Knead dough until smooth, about 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and allow dough to rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into quarters. Roll out 
1 quarter at a time, keeping remaining well covered. Roll dough into 8-inch 
circle, 1/16-inch thick. Cut into four triangles. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large saucepan or deep-fryer kettle. When oil is hot, almost 
smoking, fry one triangle at a time until golden, continuously spooning hot oil 
over dough. Turn and brown other side. 
</P>
<P>
Remove triangles with slotted spoon to paper towels. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Turn off heat under pan while rolling each batch, then reheat before frying 
triangles. Makes about 24.

morning to the smell of pilillis. ; Photo, COLOR, The Californios laughed at 
work and disdained money -- but they knew how to entertain. A barbacoa at 
Ventura's Los Olivos Adobe meant that vast platters of food -- enchiladas, 
hand-made tortillas, and the world's best beans -- came out of the rustic 
kitchen. But the important food -- rosemary-marinated lamb -- was cooked 
outdoors on the grill. ANN SUMMA

IN FILMLAND'S GOLDEN AGE, THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESSFUL ENTERTAINING WAS LESS 
DEPENDENT UPON WHAT WAS SERVED THAN ON WHO WAS SERVED.

A recipe for successful entertaining during the Golden Age of Hollywood: Take 
one soupcon of food (almost anything would do). Add large splashes of alcohol. 
Mix in good company. Serve with relish. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the recipe's success was less dependent upon what was served than 
on who was served. Hollywood was short on sophistication about food and wine. 
What it had was plenty of money -- and lots of style. 
</P>
<P>
Consider screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, author of "Citizen Kane" and 
Hollywood's most famous man who went to dinner. Hostesses could count on 
Mankiewicz' sparkling wit to lend fame to the most ordinary dinner gathering. 
Of Orson Welles he once remarked: "There but for the grace of God, goes God." 
Of Charlie Chaplin: "If people don't sit at Chaplin's feet, he goes and stands 
where they're sitting." Of a fellow screenwriter: "It ought to be against the 
law for that guy to be alone with a typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
One night, Mankiewicz was having dinner at the home of producer Arthur 
Hornblow, who considered himself one of Hollywood's foremost gourmets. In the 
midst of dinner, Mankiewicz began to turn green and all at once excused 
himself. The company was aghast. When he returned a few minutes later, he was 
looking better. Turning casually to his host he remarked, "Don't worry, Arthur. 
The white wine came up with the fish." 
</P>
<P>
Mankiewicz was as famous for his capacity for imbibition as he was for his wit. 
Sam Goldwyn once lambasted Mankiewicz for his drinking and, to make his point, 
thrust a script by a younger writer under the veteran's nose, announcing, "This 
is what I mean by screen writing!" Mankiewicz read the new pages, looked up at 
Goldwyn and responded, "He should drink." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But not at the Goldwyns. The Goldwyns were undeniably the premier 
hosts of Hollywood. Director George Cukor called an invitation to Sam and 
Frances Goldwyn's the "hardest ticket in town." And yet director Henry Koster 
told a tale about a fabulous evening at the Goldwyns when they were celebrating 
a new film. The best of everything was served. But shortly after his departure, 
Koster realized his wife had left a glove behind. He dashed back, only to 
discover the rich and powerful Goldwyn pouring the remains of undrunk glasses 
of Lafite Rothschild back into a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, people clamored to go to the Goldwyns. Actress Katharine Hepburn recalls 
that the Goldwyns traditionally sat across from one another in the middle of 
the table, and their guests were placed around them. "You always knew where 
your career stood," she says, "by where you sat." 
</P>
<P>
San Simeon was another coveted dinner invitation -- and once again, the food 
was beside the point. At William Randolph Hearst's fantastic castle, diners 
were served in a vast room under a 400-year-old monastery ceiling. But amid the 
elegant plates and sparkling silver there were ordinary bottles of catsup and 
mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even when Hollywood ate hamburgers, it did it with style. One Hollywood 
denizen told of dining at the Kirk Douglas' and being served burgers from 
silver platters. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Todd, producer husband of Elizabeth Taylor, once impressed guests by 
having their steaks specially flown in from Kansas City -- an incredible 
extravagance. He was going to barbecue them and invited his guests to come 
inside until the fire was perfect. In the interim, a fox ate the steaks. Todd 
sent out for Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
If you were actually going out to dinner in Hollywood, you went to one of 
Hollywood's two and only favorite restaurants: Chasen's or Romanoff's. Anything 
else was slumming. Mostly, though, you ate at home. Movie-star cookbooks from 
the golden days are filled with fascinating recipes for such esoterica as 
Buttermilk Griddle Cakes (Gary Cooper), Meat Loaf (Mae Clarke, who insisted 
that "The beauty of a good meat loaf is that if there is any left it makes 
delicious sandwiches . . .") and chicken broth (Irene Dunne, who pleaded with 
her fans not to omit the nutmeg in the recipe. "It is just the touch of 
flavoring that adds zest to the broth."). 
</P>
<P>
Few stars, however, were as candid as Clara Bow. She offered a recipe for 
Deviled Oysters on the Half Shell (see below left). And Bow gave due credit to 
her cook; cooking the oysters herself, she said, was simply too much for her. 
</P>
<P>
DEVILED OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL 
</P>
<P>
4 dozen shucked oysters, shells reserved 
</P>
<P>
3 spring onions, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 mushroom caps 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon parsley 
</P>
<P>
1 egg yolk 
</P>
<P>
Buttered cracker crumbs 
</P>
<P>
Wash and chop oysters. Cook onions in butter three minutes, add flour and stir 
well until blended; add milk and cream. Add mustards, Worcestershire sauce, 
mushrooms and parsley. Stir in reserved oysters and 2-3 tablespoons of their 
liquor. Heat and stir just until mixture thickens and begins to simmer, then 
mix in egg yolk; place mixture in deep halves of oyster shells, cover with 
buttered crumbs and bake at 400 degrees about 15 minutes. Makes 32.

EVERY NIGHT'S A PARTY AT BARBARA LAZAROFF'S RESTAURANTS -- SPAGO, EUREKA,

The first party that I really, really remember was the 25th birthday party that 
I gave for myself. I took a column from Variety to a typesetter who made 
invitations that read, "Unemployed Actress Throws Surprise Quarter-of-a-Century 
Birthday Bash for Herself." Then, I cooked for a week. Lasagna. Things like 
that, because some of it had to be frozen. Two hundred people came. You know, 
my most intimate friends. Shortly after that, I met Wolf (husband Wolfgang 
Puck). Now, it's great. I have a built-in chef, the best catering company in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
I think my kids' parties are the most legendary. I think I have a great 
capacity for throwing kids' parties because I have a real childlike mentality. 
I think I dress like a kid. I love sparkly clothes. I love makeup. 
</P>
<P>
I spent a year planning my son Cameron's birthday party. From the moment he was 
born, I thought, "Goodness, I'm going to have to give him a great first 
birthday party . . . ." There are people in this town who have more money and 
more space and give more elaborate parties. But there has to be something on 
top of the spectacular, dramatic, different, unique. There has to be something 
haimishe about the party. Homey. It has to be folksy, friendly, warm, real. 
Otherwise, it could be anybody's party. 
</P>
<P>
See, it's the details. The only thing that makes the difference between good 
and great in any aspect of your life, whether it be party-giving, sex, 
motherhood or your career, is the details. Two months before the party, I had 
this company make topiaries -- each one was a different ivy animal and all of 
them had cowboy hats on. Then, there were big topiaries placed all over the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
I had an artist friend named Catrinka hand paint 60 T-shirts to read, "You're 
Invited to Cameron's Wild Cow Birthday Party." And they showed these cows 
frolicking in party hats on top of all these presents and cakes and things. 
</P>
<P>
For the kids, we had the pony rides, a cowboy clown singing music. And I have 
28 animals -- six cats, parrots, llamas. So there were the animals to play 
with. Balloons everywhere. And when the kids arrived, most of them were wearing 
their Cameron T-shirts, so everybody was dressed the same. Nobody had to worry 
about what the children were wearing. There was a sense of equality. 
</P>
<P>
The food was really interesting because there was adult food . . . and there 
was kid food. I think it's stupid to feed children things they don't like to 
eat. The adults ate sausages from Eureka, barbecued chicken, steak. And the 
kids had hamburgers. Lots of ice cream. Maida Heatter flew in from Florida and 
brought seven huge suitcases of cookies she had made and wrapped herself. She 
put them in her luggage and not one broke. 
</P>
<P>
And on the way out, each kid got a cow box, a cardboard milk crate filled with 
prizes. Plastic cows. Pencils that had cow heads on them. Cowboys that wound up 
and moved across the table. Milk Duds. I had people calling me afterwards 
saying that their kids never had so much fun at a party. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes people said, "Barbara . . . it's kind of elaborate and very involved. 
Don't you ever just flip out?" Sure. But I figured my son's first birthday is 
only going to happen once. 
</P>
<P>
I've had Christmas Eve parties for the last few years. Dinner parties at home. 
Completely the antithesis of the kid's party where everyone is jumping in and 
out of the pool. It's a totally different feeling. More elegant. 
</P>
<P>
For the Christmas Eve party, it's the same as if I'm creating a restaurant. I 
spend two weeks decorating the tree. 
</P>
<P>
I pay attention to everything. The food, the ambience, the help, the whole 
spirit of the event. The music is going. I put The Smell of Christmas -- a 
packaged mixture of cinnamon and herbs -- everywhere. The candles are burning 
everywhere. All the crystal is out. The smell of the food is coming out of the 
kitchen. Wolfgang cooks. And mind you, he doesn't get to sit down until the end 
of the meal. It's very . . . elegant. 
</P>
<P>
When I throw a party, I start with a concept. And because I'm very visual, I 
tend to start with what it's going to look like -- the decorations and all 
that. And then, basically, I think about what I want the food to be like, and 
then I go to my famous caterer and I tell him what I'd like. And, frankly, 
sometimes he fights back. He'll say, "I don't want to cook at the grill all day 
. . ." And I understand. He works hard all the time. But I usually win. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a good party is a spiritual thing to me. I think to give a wonderful 
party for the friends you love and appreciate is a most important thing. When I 
invite people to my house, I don't want anything from them -- and I hope they 
don't want anything from me, except friendship. 
</P>
<P>
I want people to come to my home and know that I'm there for them. I check. I 
go around. I can see when someone's not having fun. You have to take care of 
your guests. Wolf always says to me, "You never have much fun at your parties." 
</P>
<P>
What gives me pleasure is having someone call me up and say, "That was a really 
wonderful party. The place looked fabulous. The kids had such a great time." 
Then I look at all the photographs I took -- I have 120 photo albums of 
pictures I have taken -- and think about the memories. That feels good. 
</P>
<P>
My whole life is about providing service. I mean, at the restaurants I walk 
around all night saying to people, "Hi, how's your dinner? How's your family? 
How's everything?" And so when I go out into the world, that kind of thing just 
falls out of my mouth. I go to other people's parties and I'm always going 
around asking, "How's everything?" 
</P>
<P>
It's my way of making people happy. I also think it's fun. Also, in a way, it's 
my way of being a little girl all over again. I get to perform. I get to feed. 
I get to decorate. What more could a person ask for?

THE PATRIARCH OF 'PARENTHOOD'

Actor William Windom strolls into the room sporting an Irish blackthorn walking 
stick, a subtle touch that lends a theatrical flair to his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Windom, the curmudgeonly grandfather in NBC's "Parenthood," is adept at 
gestures that get him noticed in supporting roles. Until this season he played 
Dr. Seth Hazlitt on CBS' "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
He describes his "Parenthood character, Frank Buckman, as "kind of a pain in 
the butt," adding, "So am I." 
</P>
<P>
"Frank's resigned to being the elder statesman of the family," Windom said. 
"He's old Mr. Reliable without a lot of laughs. He doesn't expect a lot of 
people, and he's seldom disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Windom's character has a touchy relationship with one of his sons, played by Ed 
Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bit of warfare there," he said. "If you can combine it with a hug 
now and then, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Windom takes over the "Parenthood" role played in the hit movie by a longtime 
associate and former nextdoor neighbor, Jason Robards. 
</P>
<P>
"He was Doc Holliday in 'Hour of the Gun,' and I was one of the henchmen," 
Windom recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Windom, who had spent 15 years on Broadway appearing in 24 plays, got one of 
his biggest acting challenges in his 1962 film debut. He shared courtroom 
scenes with Gregory Peck in the Academy Award-winning "To Kill a Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the district attorney, and he was the defense attorney," he said. "I 
didn't have many lines. I had to keep making up all kinds of business. I'd have 
my tie on funny, chew on a pencil, throw my leg over a chair." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Windom moved to Los Angeles to concentrate on movies and 
television. In his first TV series, "The Farmers's Daughter," he was the 
congressman and romantic interest for Inger Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
In his second, "My World and Welcome To It," he won a 1970 Emmy as best actor 
in a comedy series -- after the show had been canceled. His role was loosely 
based on the works of writer-cartoonist James Thurber. Since 1972, the actor 
has done four one-man shows on Thurber material; he is currently at the 
Westwood Playhouse Tuesday-Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
He also has added World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle to his repertoire. He 
will perform "Ernie Pyle" Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at Pasadena's Ambassador 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking around for another one-man show," said Windom, who was with the 
82nd Airborne in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. "I didn't want to do 
George Washington or Mark Twain. I thought of something from World War II. I 
was going to do fiction, until I discovered Pyle. I also found some of his 
civilian writing. He was a very sensitive human being, like Thurber. 
</P>
<P>
"I still do (the Pyle show) on weekends. It keeps the stage in me alive. The 
stage makes me more confident to do movies and television. And movies and 
television help you sell more tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Windom recently was in St. Joseph, Mo., to film "Back To Hannibal: The Return 
of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn," now airing on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, now grown up, return to defend 
their friend Jim on a murder charge. Windom plays Judge Thatcher, Becky 
Thatcher's father. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't film in Hannibal because the city's too built up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Windom began acting in military school at the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the ingenue (in one of the school's plays) since it was an all-boys 
school," he said. "My mother came backstage afterward, and she hadn't realized 
I was actually in it. I held up the brassiere under her nose. She said, 'You 
know, I looked at that girl."' 
</P>
<P>
The actor mused that he didn't learn of his most notable academic achievement 
until 10 years ago, during a lunch with actress Margaret Hamilton, who played 
the villain in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
"She said something about Rye, New York, and I said I had gone to kindergarten 
at the Rye Country Day School," Windom recalled. "She said she had taught 
there. We compared notes and it turned out I had been in her class. I started 
my education under the Wicked Witch of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parenthood" airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. on NBC. "Back to Hannibal: The Return of 
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn" airs Thursday at 8 p.m. and 1 a.. early Friday 
on the Disney Channel. 
</P>

If you haven't seen Singin' in the Rain (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) lately you're 
in for a treat. It's just about the most engaging musical ever, set in 
Hollywood at the advent of the talkie revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor are all justly celebrated for 
their terrific contributions, but no less dazzling is Jean Hagen as the 
pretentious, glittery silent star undone by her terrible nasal voice.

The Professionals (TMC Tuesday at 5 p.m.), Richard Brooks' terrific, slam-bang 
1966 Western, finds Ralph Bellamy hiring some soldiers-of-fortune to rescue his 
gorgeous wife Claudia Cardinale from a dastardly Jack Palance. Burt Lancaster, 
Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan and Woody Stroke star. Notable, too, for Conrad Hall's 
dexterous, beautiful cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train (TMC Thursday at 2:30 a.m.) features Wendy 
Hughes in this cryptic 1987 Australian thriller as a chameleon-like hooker who 
seduces men on a weekend night train, changing her personality to suit every 
fresh conquest.
