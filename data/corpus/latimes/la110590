<P>
Thank you for your expose "Deficit-Reduction Bill Rife With Favoritism" (front 
page, Oct. 30) that clearly demonstrates the basis of the frustration and anger 
being found in the American people today. 
</P>
<P>
The gross irony of the situation, in the stark reality of those pork-barreling 
politicians lavishing favoritism on their constituents, is that the necessary 
votes to "throw those bums out" may not arise from their home states for 
obvious reasons. 
</P>

I sincerely thank Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and wish him total success in probing 
this apparent miscarriage of the budgeting process at a time of great national 
crisis.

REGIONAL MASS TRANSIT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was refreshing to read Fulton's opinion regarding the construction of 
commuter rail transit in the Los Angeles region. I have been in enough cities 
to have learned that mass transit only works in dense, urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to be a transit expert to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
None of the transit lines proposed for Los Angeles will provide service to the 
urban Westside. This is an area where there are major, regional destinations -- 
UCLA, Westwood, Century City, the beaches, Beverly Hills, Mid-Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
If a line is built west of downtown, it will follow a low-density path from 
Santa Monica to USC. It is hard to imagine that route being a highly traveled 
one. 
</P>
<P>
It would sure be nice if someone would slow down and do some thinking before we 
end up with a multibillion-dollar rail system that serves almost no one.

REGIONAL MASS TRANSIT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of rail transportation in Southern California has been derailed many 
times by old-fashioned attitudes such as the ones expressed by William Fulton 
in his Opinion article ("Transit Rides the Rail Right-of-Way With Opportunistic 
Approach in L.A.," Oct. 21). 
</P>
<P>
One attitude is that Southern California is so spread out that only a handful 
of us will benefit from rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that many commuters can't -- or won't -- use rail transit regularly. 
Both of these attitudes are wrong. Times have changed! 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) is building an 
integrated system serving all of Southern California with light rail such as 
the Blue Line, heavy rail such as the Red Line subway, long-distance commuter 
rail, which we can start very quickly on our new 175 miles of right-of-way, 
plus the freeway system, surface streets and buses. Everyone knows that we will 
also need our freeways, streets and roads for people who will need -- or prefer 
-- to use their cars. 
</P>
<P>
All Southern California will benefit because we have saved the Southern Pacific 
rights-of-way for future generations.

TURNED OFF BY POLITICS? THERE'S A WAY OUT OF THE SWAMP; 
</P>
<P>
THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF CAMPAIGN-FINANCING REFORMS LIKE PROPOSITION 131 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sherlock Holmes once assured Dr. Watson that while it may be impossible to 
predict the behavior of one person, predicting how an entire group will behave 
is a cinch. 
</P>
<P>
American politics makes a good example. It is seldom possible outside a 
courtroom to say with certainty that a given politician is corrupt. It is also 
impossible to deny that the system itself has been so sufficiently corrupted 
that its very credibility is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The great corrupter is lust for money. The most effective cure at hand is 
campaign-finance reform, something that must start at the grass roots. 
California can do just that by approving Proposition 131 on the state ballot 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Why not start reform at the top? Look to Washington. The most shocking 
financial scandal in American political history -- the savings and loan 
disaster that will cost taxpayers at least $500 billion -- is still growing and 
implicating members of Congress. But even scandal on that scale has not shamed 
Congress into reforms that would make its members stop raking in whatever 
amount of money they take from whatever source to be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
For one example of the grotesque distortions produced by the present system of 
financing elections, consider United States senators. They are generally what 
they seem to be -- powerful men -- or, in two cases, women -- with powerful 
friends, some so expert in defense, agriculture, taxes or other matters that 
they can stare down the President on an issue. They are not the sort you would 
expect to hear begging a colleague not to force him to vote against a bill his 
contributors want with the phrase: "Please don't hurt me on this bill." 
</P>
<P>
But powerful men pleading not to be hurt is a common sight these days as 
senators become the nation's most vulnerable legislators and money their only 
real defense against defeat. Translated, it means: "Please don't force me to 
make a choice in public between my contributors and my constituents." 
</P>
<P>
This happens increasingly because interest groups are able to rent -- not buy, 
but rent -- entire blocs of votes with contributions of cash that legislators 
need, or think they need, to stay in office. Thus, debates often are carried on 
not so much among senators as among competing corporate interests, with voters 
allowed to speak only when they are spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
Senators are most vulnerable because they have trouble turning entire states 
into safe districts the way that all but a handful of members of the House of 
Representatives can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CRAVING FOR CASH: 
</P>
<P>
But the insatiable appetites of senators for cash are not unique. They are 
reflected all down the political line to the most modest city hall. The main 
difference is in the amount it takes to satisfy the craving. 
</P>
<P>
A classic example of that was cited in a study of local elections published 
last year by the California Commission on Campaign Financing. Candidates for 
council in Pasadena, known as the Board of Directors, ran at-large in the city 
until 1983, when it was divided into seven districts. That should have allowed 
candidates to reach all the voters they needed to reach with just one-seventh 
the amount of money they once had to spend. But two years later, candidates 
spent nearly 14 times as much money campaigning in small districts as they did 
in 1979 when they ran at-large. 
</P>
<P>
The California Commission, whose businessmen, lawyers, academics and 
reform-minded politicians have stuck with a largely thankless task for several 
years, has examined only the state political system. But the flaws it finds can 
be found not only in most other states but in Washington, D.C., as well. And 
its proposed reforms would work as well on the East Coast as on the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PERPETUAL PANHANDLERS: 
</P>
<P>
Virtually the entire present system of political finance is corrupting to some 
degree, but the most grievous damage is done by the fact that politicians can, 
and do, raise money every day of every year, not just when they need to pay the 
costs of a campaign for reelection. Outsiders hoping to mount a challenge that 
will get them inside government can raise money the same way, but pickings for 
challengers are usually slim. The odds favor incumbents so heavily that giving 
money to challengers is often like throwing it out a car window. 
</P>
<P>
The California Commission found that incumbents raised 60% of their campaign 
funds in off-years; challengers raised only 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Times writers Sara Fritz and Dwight Morris, in last week's series of reports on 
campaign finances, found a similar pattern on Capitol Hill. One result of the 
politics of perpetual panhandling is that it allows elected officials to act 
less as public servants than as entrepreneurs whose business is politics rather 
than flowers, fast food, bicycles or coffee and Danish. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Henry A Waxman, Mel Levine and Howard L. Berman, all Los Angeles 
Democrats, meet regularly in Waxman's office to make lists of colleagues whose 
gratitude they can guarantee by sharing campaign funds they do not need in 
their own safe districts. Anti-trust laws prohibit such behavior among 
corporations. For anyone else, it might be classified as vote-buying. The 
Californians defend the process as a way to promote liberal thought in American 
politics. The same pattern shows up in conservative circles, yet another 
instance where the claim that everybody is doing it does not make the practice 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), for example, has a fund-raising 
operation on the side that solicits money from a customized mailing list of 
conservative contributors. As a sideline to his sideline, he rents the names on 
his list to like-minded patriots who need to expand their own mail solicitation 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NON-CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
The California Commission on Finance Reform said 86% of the money collected by 
politicians in off-years came from political committees, business interests or 
labor unions, none of which confuses politics with charity. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fritz and Morris, the off-year collections are used to buy fancy 
automobiles for members of Congress; throw $100,000 barbecues in Texas; send 
retiring representatives to pasture with $500,000 nest eggs of unused campaign 
funds, and even to buy airline tickets for official trips, because it is easier 
than filling out government forms to justify the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians say the gigantic increases in campaign contributions reflect 
no more than inflated costs of campaigning. Both the Fritz-Morris series and 
the California Commission report document that as nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
For example, direct-mail spending by state legislative candidates went up 155% 
between 1978 and 1982 to reach voters whose numbers increased only 12%. The 
increase obviously had less to do with inflation than with campaign technique. 
In fact, postage costs actually fell. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern turns up in national campaigns. The average House candidate 
spends only 13% of a campaign budget on television. 
</P>
<P>
Where does the rest of the money go? What Fritz and Morris found in their 
computer-assisted search was that big chunks are spent raising even more money, 
or keeping political staffs busy between elections doing favors for VIP 
constituents or getting the congressman's name in the papers. It is spent, in 
short, to support mini-political machines devoted to a single candidate, much 
the way New York's Tammany Hall used to operate to support an entire Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131 would not clean up all of American politics, but it is a place 
to start. Because it sets term limits, candidates would be less likely to think 
of politics as a form of going into business on their own. It would stop 
year-round fund-raising, put a limit on how much big contributors could give 
and add public funds to private funds to encourage candidates to put a ceiling 
on expenses. 
</P>
<P>
One specious argument often used against public financing is that it would add 
to the financial advantage of incumbents over challengers. The reverse is true. 
If an incumbent tried to swamp a challenger with big spending, public funds 
would allow a challenger to keep his or her head above water. Another argument 
is that an incumbent has so many advantages against a challenger that a level 
campaign-spending playing field in fact tilts to the incumbent, who is unlikely 
to be ousted unless a challenger can thoroughly outspend him. There is some 
truth to this observation, and in fact public financing does not guarantee a 
level playing field. But it does give a challenger a better chance -- and it 
removes special-interest giving from the financing. 
</P>
<P>
There are many different systems of campaign financing; the one offered in 
Proposition 131 is just one way to go. But it is clearly a step in the right 
direction. A yes vote on Proposition 131 may be the most important vote on the 
huge state ballot Tuesday, because saving politics from itself has to start 
here and start now.

GOP: THE PARTY OF TWO IDEAS, BOTH DEAD; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S THE REPUBLICANS' TURN TO BE INTELLECTUALLY BANKRUPT. THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
STIRRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Daniel Moynihan pro nounced the Democratic Party brain-dead. The 
Democrats had "ceased to be a party of ideas" while the Republicans were now 
"serious about ideas," wrote Moynihan, a man with enough ideas of his own to 
supply several political parties. Moynihan was right. Spent by the success of 
the New Deal and having no idea what to do next, by 1980 the Democratic Party 
was intellectually bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
It is 10 years later and another bankruptcy needs to be declared. While 
blunders are blamed and fingers pointed, the Republican collapse of 1990 is too 
large to be explained simply by the tactical errors of George Bush in the great 
budget crunch. Republican malaise goes far deeper than that. The party has run 
out of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it did not have many to begin with. Two to be exact. (Though that 
was two more than the Democrats had in the 1980s.) One was peace through 
strength. The other was growth through low taxes. Reagan and Bush rode these 
simple and appealing maxims to three smashing electoral victories. The 
Republican problem today is that both ideas are dead. Peace through strength is 
now politically obsolete. And painless prosperity through low taxes has proven 
false. 
</P>
<P>
Peace through strength has been undone by its own success. Reagan insisted on 
strength: increased defense spending, unpopular missile deployments and honest 
"evil empire" rhetoric.There are many reasons for the collapse of the Soviet 
empire -- but one of them certainly is that the United States did not seek some 
phony armistice with the Soviets as urged by the post-Vietnam accommodationists 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one problem with peace through strength as a unifying and winning 
political idea. It is now as obsolete as communism. It still has application, 
of course, in places like the Persian Gulf. But this is a harder sell. Soviet 
missiles were a threat to the American homeland and Soviet ideology a threat to 
the American idea. Iraq is neither. Since Vietnam, the Republican Party has 
been the nationalist party. But as shown by the rise of conservative 
isolationism, in a post-Cold War world, Republicans are finding it much harder 
to articulate a coherent nationalist program. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the still-nebulous "new world order" is a glimmer of an idea. On 
domestic policy, however, Republican thinking has collapsed completely. Growth 
through low taxes, inflated by Bush to no-new-taxes, was by nature a 
time-limited proposition. Once the Laffer Curve free lunch was shown to be 
nonsense, it became clear that though low taxes could produce growth and jobs 
and prosperity, they could not do so forever because they also produced 
fantastic debt, now exceeding $3 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
It was only a matter of time before Bush bent to reality and agreed to new 
taxes. That may save the economy, but it will sink the Republican Party. 
No-new-taxes was, after all, Bush's only domestic idea. 
</P>
<P>
Its beauty was that it was not just an idea, it was an idea stopper. No taxes 
meant never having to say which taxes. Republicans were insulated from ever 
having to face the real question of governance: choosing who gets taxed and how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Republican politicians who for a decade prospered politically 
behind the tax shield were apoplectic when Bush gave it up. They understood 
that it would leave them defenseless to Democratic charges that they were the 
party of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Once Bush came down from the Andrews Air Force Base Summit and presented the 
country with a list of service cuts and gas and beer taxes, people realized 
that the game was up. Somebody was going to have to pay past and present bills 
and Bush had decided which ones. Bushonomics was exposed as nothing more than 
classic (i.e., pre-Reagan) Republican trickle-down economics, a known political 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
Take away no new taxes and what does the Republican Party stand for? Cutting 
the capital-gains tax, Bush insisted for a while. But this is not just a paltry 
substitute for no-new-taxes. It is a hopelessly class-biased substitute. It 
thus promotes the Democratic claim that the Republicans are now what they 
always were before the Reagan mirage, the party of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Bush finally caved on capital gains too. Even half an idea is more 
than the party is now capable of sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
What does a party do when it runs out of ideas? It can only hope that the other 
guy has even fewer ideas. This time, however, the Democrats may not cooperate. 
The soak-the-rich, burden-the-allies, pro-choice Democrats are stirring. It is 
too soon to say that they are out of their coma. But there is movement beneath 
the eyelids.

NO QUESTION ABOUT IT: CLIPPERS STORM BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Showing no sign of regret, the Clippers went from a bad scene to a difficult 
situation within a couple of quarters Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bad scene: Getting blitzed at the start against Golden State to fall behind by 
19 points in the first quarter, 28-9, and 20 in the second, 36-16. Then putting 
together a 42-point third quarter, tying the score, 82-82, late that period and 
winning, 109-107, on Ken Norman's jumper from the top of the key as the game 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
Difficult situation: Topping this in the next 80 games for a more emotional 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been as proud of a group than this team," Coach Mike Schuler said. 
"What this team did tonight, please don't minimalize it." 
</P>
<P>
Minimize a furious comeback with a makeshift lineup, Danny Manning and Benoit 
Benjamin in street clothes and Charles Smith sidelined for the entire second 
half because of a foot injury? Against a quality team capable of scoring in 
bunches, as it proved early? 
</P>
<P>
Not in five years. 
</P>
<P>
That's how long it has been since the Clippers opened 2-0, and in 1985-86, 
their second season in Los Angeles, the streak stretched to 5-0. Consider this 
a good start. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 63-47, at halftime and showed only minimal signs of life, the 
best part of the first two quarters for the 11,173 fans having been the Warrior 
lead being cut from 20 to 11 points moments earlier. Smith had played 15 
minutes on his badly sprained left foot, and Schuler pulled him during 
intermission to avoid further injury. 
</P>
<P>
No reason to be concerned? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Schuler said without hesitation when asked if he considered the outlook 
bleak. "Because we were only down eight baskets. Twenty-four minutes and eight 
baskets. We got four quick baskets at the start of the second half. I didn't go 
to the University of Cal, but I know that's eight points. You're in the 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers continued to bear down. With 2:29 to play in the third, Golden 
State's advantage was two, and when Norman scored 19 seconds later, the game 
was tied. Fouled, he made the free throw for their first lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors briefly regained the lead but the Clippers, who play their next 
game Tuesday at Oakland, were ahead, 89-86, going into the final 12 minutes. 
The highlights in the third quarter included eight consecutive baskets, 71.4% 
shooting and a 26-10 run over the final 5:40. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers pushed the advantage to 97-92 when Winston Garland made two free 
throws against his former teammates with 8:28 left. Schuler was already going 
heavy on guards, and with 2:20 left he had four matched with Norman, the big 
man at 6-feet-9. The coach substituted, but he did not deviate from the quick 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
With 4.7 seconds left, Schuler called a timeout with the score 107-107. The 
Clippers had another chance to win, thanks to Jeff Martin grabbing the rebound 
as Tom Garrick's shot went long with about 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler sent out Garland, Garrick, Bo Kimble, Gary Grant and Norman, still the 
center by default. He didn't shoot outside like one, however. 
</P>
<P>
Garland got the ball to Norman, was was guarded closely by Warrior Tom Tolbert 
at the top of the key. Norman pivoted a few times to try to shake the defender, 
but that didn't work. So he went up as the clock wound down. 
</P>
<P>
The shot swished as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to try to get to the basket," said Norman, who had 26 points and 13 
rebounds, both team highs. "But they sent the guy (Tolbert) over, so obviously 
I had to pick up my dribble. I tried to pump fake once to get him up in the 
air, but he didn't go for it. So I just rose above him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good view of the basket. I saw the basket all the way and never lost 
sight of it. It looked good from the time it left my hand." 
</P>
<P>
Never a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
With the Clippers showing interest in being picked to play overseas, NBA 
Commissioner David Stern said the league will return to Japan for 
regular-season games, although he cautioned no timetable has been set. "It's a 
certainty we'll go back on a periodic basis in light of the success of the 
games," Stern said of the two-game Utah-Phoenix matchup Saturday and Sunday in 
Tokyo. "But I don't know whether it'll be an annual event." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, Benoit Benjamin (separated shoulder) and Danny Manning 
(tendinitis of the knee) will be examined today. X-rays and a bone scan on the 
outside of Smith's left foot and ankle showed no break, but it has been 
bothering him for about about seven days. "It could be a week, it could be a 
day," team physician Dr. Tony Daly said. . . . Smith and Ron Harper have been 
elected team captains for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Butler, a Rolling Hills native, has supporters here. But more than in New 
York, a city he had no connection with until two seasons ago? "No way," said 
Butler, a free-agent signee before training camp. "There is no possible way to 
be as popular as I was there." With the Knicks, Butler was the guy at the end 
of the bench who got the biggest cheer when checking in, usually late in the 
game. Butler played only 46 games and 173 minutes in two seasons, but few home 
appearances came without the appreciation of a star. "That happened once and it 
could never happen again," he said, smiling. "I was the rookie second-rounder 
who beat the odds."

RAMS' SECONDARY IS PRIMARY REASON FOR BEATING OILERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: HUMPHERY, HENLEY MAKE THE BIG PLAYS TO KEEP MOON OUT OF THE END 
ZONE, 17-13. 
</P>

<P>
The Rams' last stand, fittingly enough, came down to a last-gasp pass in the 
last minute of the last quarter of a game that probably was their last stab at 
lasting in the playoff race past November. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, Custer, they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, to the surprise of many, emerged from Sunday afternoon's 17-13 
victory over the Houston Oilers still upright -- if still teetering on the 
brink of collapse -- and dizzy with the rare taste of victory. 
</P>
<P>
When cornerback Bobby Humphery made it across the field in time to knock away 
Oiler quarterback Warren Moon's fourth-down pass to running back Allen Pinkett 
at the goal line with 40 seconds left in the game, the Rams just couldn't 
contain themselves before 52,628 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could do a back flip like Henry Ellard, I would've tried," quarterback 
Jim Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson was spared that sight, but you got the feeling he 
wished he could have been doing some giddy gymnastics after the Humphery play, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a win we needed desperately," Robinson said, "and this was a win we 
got. We're going to enjoy it as a team. The game gives us life." 
</P>
<P>
Humphery's mad dash was the most dramatic of a series of clutch plays performed 
Sunday by a Rams' secondary that had been pillaged all season by opponent 
quarterbacks and was missing Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, the Oilers (4-5) would threaten, then again and again Humphery 
or newly activated cornerback Darryl Henley or somebody would make a play to 
stave off the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moon and the Oilers' run-and-shoot offense collected 366 yards and 
although Moon himself passed for 343, the Ram defense contained Houston as well 
as could be expected. Moon, who entered the game having thrown just one 
interception in his last 156 attempts, was intercepted twice near the Ram goal 
line -- once by Henley, once by Humphery. 
</P>
<P>
When it counted most, when Moon had four shots at stealing the game from inside 
the 10-yard line, the Rams made their stand. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, after leading Houston down the field, had first-and-goal at the Ram 
seven-yard line with 1:45 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was appropriate that it came down to the defense shouldering the 
load for the final four plays," linebacker Kevin Greene said. "It came down to 
the last play, the last seconds. And we made the play." 
</P>
<P>
With Robinson scheming to conserve the clock if the Oilers went ahead, the Ram 
defenders first stopped running back Lorenzo White for one yard, stopped White 
again for one yard on a Moon pass, then held tight when a pass flicked off the 
hands of Ernest Givins in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth down, Oilers on the five-yard line, 47 seconds left and "a few prayers" 
left for Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Moon dropped back, looked to his right, felt the pressure of the Rams' 
three-man rush, then saw what everybody else saw: Pinkett wide open in the left 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was kind of running around," Henley said. "The play seemed to take 
like 11 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Moon twisted around and sent the ball Pinkett's way, Humphery had 
begun his scamper from the back-middle of the end zone, and for a long moment 
the game was just three things: the ball, Pinkett floating into the end zone 
and Humphery dashing to knock it away. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it like it was in slow motion," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Then everything was quick again, with Humphery smashing the ball with two hands 
out of bounds and the whole Ram defense celebrating like they had won the state 
high school championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams finished the game having held Houston to three points in the final two 
periods. They did it mostly with their basic 3-4 alignment, eschewing the 
seven-defensive back formations most teams play against Houston after a brief 
first-half flirtation with it. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was sacked just once, but was not allowed to saunter outside and buy extra 
time for his receivers. And when he did pile up enough passes to get his team 
downfield, Humphery and Henley were there to end it. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' usually potent offense, despite Cleveland Gary's 87 rushing yards, 
was having its own problems with Houston, turning what by all accounts appeared 
to be a scoreboard breaker into a defensive brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange how football games don't go the way people expect them to," 
Robinson said. "To have, what, four points (actually, three) scored in the 
second half seems impossible. But that's one of the great things about this 
game. Most of us, you, me, anybody that likes to predict, doesn't ever quite 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Something happened in the game that just made it into a defensive contest." 
</P>
<P>
Early, the Oilers, Moon and the run-and-shoot did not disappoint, sprinting up 
the field for a 40-yard Moon-to-Drew Hill touchdown pass and a 22-yard Teddy 
Garcia field goal on their only two first-quarter possessions. 
</P>
<P>
On the Hill touchdown, Moon found his receiver wide open after Hill ran by 
Henley and a late-arriving Pat Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers took their second possession 70 yards on nine plays but had to 
settle for Garcia's kick when receiver Leonard Harris dropped Moon's delivery 
in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams answered both drives and tied the game at 10 with a 19-yard, 
first-quarter Mike Lansford field goal, then a one-yard touchdown plunge by 
Gary early in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping Houston for the first time, the Rams marched 80 yards on 10 
plays for a 17-10 lead, with Everett completing passes to tight end Pete 
Holohan and Ellard for a combined 45 yards. Everett then threw the 100th 
touchdown pass of his career (including playoffs) when tight end Damone Johnson 
was wide open in the end zone from two yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Everett completed 10 passes in a row from the end of first half to beginning of 
third quarter. But the string came to an ugly end when he underthrew Johnson, 
allowing safety Leander Knight to step into the flat, intercept the pass at the 
Oiler 15 and end the Rams' drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers broke the scoring drought and narrowed the Ram lead to four points 
early in the fourth, completing an 11-play drive with Garcia's 32-yard field 
goal, ending the scoring at 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers threatened again after blocking Keith English's punt in the fourth 
quarter, but were denied by Humphery's interception in the end zone -- almost 
exactly where he would later end their last hope a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels so good," fullback Buford McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Mickey Sutton hurt his left knee and is scheduled to be X-rayed for 
possible damage today. . . . Although cornerback Jerry Gray dressed, he did not 
play, nursing a sore left knee. Sutton started in his place, then had to be 
replaced by Darryl Henley. Henley was seeing his first action of the year after 
being activated off the injured-reserve list.

RAIDER DEFENSE GOES IT ALONE IN LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: IT GIVES UP ONLY 169 YARDS, BUT THE OFFENSE STAYS DAMP AND COLD 
AS CHIEFS WIN, 9-7. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders' defense went more than a thousand miles for this showdown; their 
offense looked as if it pooped out somewhere around Wichita. The defense held 
the Kansas City Chiefs to three field goals and 169 yards. Disregarding the 
sleet factor, the offense sent up weather balloons and kept calling them 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' defense had the home crowd booing its own team, while the home 
team was winning. Greg Townsend was in the Chiefs' backfield often enough to be 
accused of stealing the playbook. The Raiders' offense could have used one. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a dream last night that they kicked three field goals," Howie Long said. 
"That's the God's honest truth. But I didn't know what we were going to do on 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
Not much, it turned out, and that was enough for Kansas City to defeat the 
Raiders, 9-7, before 70,951 at Arrowhead Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' two-game lead in the AFC West was reduced to one during a 
defensive struggle made more grueling by a chilling rain and 37-degree 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The offenses were expected to pound it out on the ground and wait for 
turnovers. Not surprisingly, the only points manufactured without assistance -- 
fumble, blocked punt, fumble -- came on a 42-yard drive that ended with Nick 
Lowery's third field goal with 11:58 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on a cold, gray, treacherous day, one that suggested even more conservative 
thinking, the Raiders broke their axiom: Thou shalt not throw 30 passes in a 
game and expect to win. That's in dry weather. Coach Art Shell spoke of the 
passage, with some with passion, earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
So it was unusual that the Raiders would die by the pass Sunday, with 
quarterback Jay Schroeder attempting 31 passes in deplorable conditions, 
against one of the league's best secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some balls I threw where I had no idea where it was going," Schroeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders thought they had exposed some mismatches, and set out to exploit 
them, rain or shine. 
</P>
<P>
With 10:17 left, the Raiders took over on the Chiefs' 49, trailing by two 
points. Schroeder threw two deep incompletions down the left sideline. On third 
and 10, he was nearly intercepted. The team's million-dollar backfield, Bo 
Jackson and Marcus Allen, could not help. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to catch them off guard on that," Schroeder said of the 
sequence. "We weren't going to pound it. It just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Allen didn't have an immediate reaction to the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to sit down and think about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said at that point in the game he wasn't thinking about crawling on the 
ground toward the possible winning field goal. He was going for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to question the calls we made," he said. "You were going for the 
field goal. We were going for the touchdown to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
The series wasn't the deciding factor, but it might have been. The Raiders had 
various mishaps and chances along the way. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Kevin Porter raced untouched through the Raiders' line 
and blocked Jeff Gossett's punt attempt. Porter recovered at the 17 and, after 
losing one yard in three attempts, the Chiefs settled for a 36-yard Lowery 
field goal to take a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing possession, two players making returns to Kansas City collided 
in the secondary. Jackson, a baseball man who plays here in summer, shot 
through the line and was met head-on by safety Deron Cherry, playing his first 
down, not of the game, but since returning from major knee surgery last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry popped the ball loose from Jackson and Albert Lewis recovered at the 
Raider 23. The Chiefs' offense retreated eight yards in three plays, forcing 
Lowery to stretch his leg on a 48-yard field goal with six seconds left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
You think Howie Long is the only guy that can have a premonition? 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Porter told me before the game that he had a dream about me last night," 
Cherry said. "He said that he dreamed that on the first play I was going to hit 
Bo and he was going to fumble. You should have seen his face when it happened, 
because we had just talked about it in the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
While the Raider defense huffed and puffed to contain the Chiefs' 500-pounder 
backfield of Christian Okoye and Barry Word, the offense squandered precious 
chances. Schroeder barely overthrew Willie Gault on a bomb in the third 
quarter. If Gault makes the catch, it's a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth, tight end Ethan Horton wasted a 25-yard reception into 
Kansas City territory by fumbling back to the Chiefs after being stripped of 
the ball by safety Lloyd Burress. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' only touchdown, a two-yard run by fullback Steve Smith with 14:52 
remaining, came after Elvis Patterson recovered a fumbled punt at the Kansas 
City 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders kept asking their defense to plug the dam, but the continuous 
pounding of Word and Okoye took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider defense, led by Townsend's seven tackles and one sack, put up a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Townsend taunted the Chiefs' sidelines, claiming he knew 
what plays were being sent into Kansas City's huddle. Townsend had a dream too, 
right? No, he said he simply studied a lot of film. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer thought something was up, and he jokingly 
offered Townsend the team's game plan during one sideline exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to give me the clips," Townsend said. "He handed them to me, I reached 
for it and he snatched it back. I'm no fool." 
</P>
<P>
Two plays the Raiders needed weren't available. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:08 left, they punted back to the Chiefs, needing one more defensive 
stand. It didn't come. On third and one at the 26, Okoye broke outside for four 
yards at the two-minute warning. On third and one at the 39, it was Okoye 
again, killing the last Raider chance with another four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs gained only 124 rushing yards, and had no run of longer than 15 
yards. But this was a game in which four-yard rushes could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the way you had to treat it," Townsend said. "That's the way it was 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson finished third in Sunday's running derby with 40 yards in 10 
carries. The Chiefs' Barry Word led all runners with 85 yards in 15 carries. 
Christian Okoye had 41 yards in 17 carries. Marcus Allen carried seven times 
for 24 yards. . . . Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg completed 10 of 21 passes 
for 59 yards. Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder completed 10 of 31 attempts for 
139 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. Schroeder, the AFC's 
top-rated passer entering the game, saw four of his passes dropped. . . . Bruce 
Wilkerson, activated from injured reserve Saturday, started at left tackle for 
Rory Graves, who was sidelined because of a strained heel. 
</P>
<P>
Raider quarterback Steve Beuerlein was inactive for the sixth consecutive week 
after receiving a roster exemption for the first two weeks. He has not been in 
uniform this season. . . . The Raiders finished with 96 yards rushing. . . . 
The Raiders, who committed only six penalties in their previous two games, were 
penalized 11 times Sunday for 65 yards.

<P>
Chicago Bear safety Mark Carrier is a distant relative of Mark Carrier, a wide 
receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny Testaverde must have been Sunday after Carrier 
intercepted two of his passes to set up a touchdown and field goal in the 
Bears' 26-6 victory over the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier, the Bears' No. 1 draft pick out of USC, also had four tackles and 
forced a fumble that gave Tampa Bay six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a great job on defense," said Carrier, a two-time All-American for the 
Trojans. "Vinny was off-balance a lot and threw a lot off his back foot. . . . 
I said all along, 'He's gonna throw to one of the Carriers, let's see which one 
it's going to be.' It was me this time." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears (7-1), who won only two of eight NFC Central games last season and 
failed to win the division for the first time in six years, intercepted five 
Testaverde passes to remain unbeaten at 4-0 within the division and avenge two 
losses to Tampa Bay in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Gayle intercepted a pass to stop Tampa Bay's best drive of the first half 
and Richard Dent and Ron Rivera intercepted passes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde completed 10 of 24 passes for 149 yards as the Buccaneers (4-5) lost 
for the fourth time in five weeks after an impressive 3-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier returned his first interception six yards to the Buccaneers 22 to set 
up a one-yard touchdown run by Neal Anderson that gave the Bears a 14-0 lead 
with 2:41 left in the first half. His second interception, at the Bears' 41, 
set up a drive that Kevin Butler capped with a 30-yard field goal with six 
seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harbaugh completed 14 of 23 passes for 213 yards, including a 19-yard 
touchdown pass play to Dennis Gentry that gave the Bears a 23-0 lead five 
minutes into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's interception and Harbaugh completions of 12 yards to Anderson and 14 
yards to Brad Muster led to a 22-yard field goal by Butler that made it 26-0. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay's offense sputtered for the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers gained a season-low 157 yards in a 41-10 loss to San Diego, then 
had only two first downs and 81 yards in the first half against the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay averted a shutout when Testaverde, who sat out the San Diego game 
with a turf-toe injury, threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Bruce Perkins early 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively we stunk," Buccaneer Coach Ray Perkins said. "The whole group."

CARTER GIVES LIFT TO VIKINGS;

<P>
The Minnesota Vikings spent the last month and a half waiting for a big play. 
Sunday night, Anthony Carter and Rich Gannon made one happen. 
</P>
<P>
Carter jumped over Alton Montgomery to catch a long touchdown pass from Gannon 
with 14:04 left as Vikings halted a five-game losing streak with a 27-22 
victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings had the ball on their own 44-yard line when Gannon handed the ball 
off to Herschel Walker, who took a step toward the line and pitched it back to 
Gannon. Gannon threw the ball high and deep even though Montgomery had tight 
coverage on Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought, 'What the heck?' and threw it up for A.C. to make the play," 
Gannon said. "I knew Anthony could go up and get it." 
</P>
<P>
Carter leaped to take the ball away from Montgomery at the 10, avoided Dennis 
Smith to stay in bounds, and trotted in for the score to complete the 56-yard 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was one of many big-name players to be criticized as Minnesota (2-6), 
the defending NFC Central champion, got off to its worst start since 1961. A 
dropped pass by Carter led directly to a loss to Tampa Bay, and he also dropped 
two passes in last week's loss to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday he caught five passes for 146 yards, and came up with the biggest 
play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Just the fact that the Vikings won was amazing. The fact that the Broncos blew 
another big lead wasn't. Denver has led at halftime in all eight games but is 
3-5. The Broncos have been outscored, 135-59, after halftime this season. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC's Super Bowl representative last season, Denver lost for the fourth 
time in five games and is off to its worst start in a non-strike season since 
1975. John Elway hurt his toe and arch after leading the Broncos to a 16-0 
first-half lead and backup quarterback Gary Kubiak was intercepted three times, 
once for a touchdown by Joey Browner. 
</P>
<P>
Did Elway's absence change the complexion of the game? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a crazy question," receiver Mark Jackson said. "Of course it did." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a backup quarterback in this league, it's your job," Kubiak said. 
"You have to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. Gannon, meanwhile, won for the first time in five starts in relief 
of Wade Wilson, who is out with a thumb injury.

SAINTS RUN OVER BENGALS, SPOIL HOMECOMING, 21-7

Perhaps the Cincinnati Bengals should have stayed on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals returned to Riverfront Stadium Sunday after five consecutive away 
games and lost to the New Orleans Saints, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Heyward and Rueben Mayes each rushed for more than 100 yards and a 
touchdown to lead the Saints (3-5), who simply overpowered the Bengal defense 
-- statistically the second-worst in the NFL -- by rushing for a season-high 
249 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward rushed for a career-high 122 yards in 19 carries and Mayes gained 115 
yards in 30 carries. It was the third time in the Saints' history that two 
backs have topped 100 yards in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
The 249 yards were the most allowed by the Bengals since New England had 281 
yards in the last game of the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stop their run," Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said. "That's fact. They 
bowled over us at times. 
</P>
<P>
"They opened holes and when we'd hit their runners, they'd fall forward. We 
didn't knock them back. There were running lanes, and when we made contact, we 
didn't knock the man backwards." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals (5-4) shuffled their linebackers and their defensive alignments to 
try to stop the rushing game. They suffered a major loss late in the first half 
when strong safety David Fulcher left the game with a separated right shoulder 
that will keep him out for four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints scored all three of their touchdowns on the ground. Gill Fenerty 
scored from the one-yard line, Mayes from the six, and Heyward from the one on 
what turned out to be the drive that broke the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 14-7, the Saints got the ball at their own nine late in the third 
quarter and ground out a 16-play drive that consumed 9:32. Heyward scored with 
10:03 left for his first touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' lone score came on an eight-yard touchdown pass from Boomer 
Esiason to Eddie Brown in the second quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta Falcons Coach Jerry Glanville has been known to leave game tickets for 
Elvis Presley, the Phantom of the Opera and James Dean. On Sunday, he should 
have left some for his offense. They never showed, either. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's offense, shut out for a half by the NFL's worst-rated defense, 
scored three touchdowns in the second half to beat the mistake-prone Falcons, 
21-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers' scores came on passes by Bubby Brister to Louis Lipps and Mike 
Mularkey and a 70-yard run by Warren Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Chris Miller, the league's fifth-rated quarterback, threw three 
interceptions -- one on the final play of the first half and two in the second 
half. He hadn't had an interception in 116 attempts and 16 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons, who committed five turnovers, managed only three field goals 
despite advancing inside the Pittsburgh 35-yard line eight times. The Falcons 
had the ball inside the Pittsburgh 30 on their first six possessions but their 
offense, averaging 28 points a game, was held without a touchdown for the first 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers (5-4), whose defense hasn't allowed a touchdown in two games, 
including the 41-10 victory over the Rams last Monday night, moved into a tie 
for the AFC Central Division lead with the Cincinnati Bengals, who were upset 
at home, 21-7, by New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, winning for the fourth time in the last five games, overcame a 
fumble by Larry Griffin on the opening kickoff to spoil Glanville's return to 
Three Rivers Stadium. Glanville had won three in a row at Pittsburgh as 
Houston's coach and was 2-0 against AFC Central Division teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This hurts; this hurts to the bone," Glanville said. "I don't think our team 
can play any harder. Just ask the Steelers -- they had somebody coming at them 
100 miles an hour the whole game. I feel bad for our players, but you can't 
make that many turnovers in this league and expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's first interception, by Dwayne Woodruff on first and 10 from the 
Steelers' 27 with 12 seconds left in the first half cost the Falcons (3-5) a 
chance to increase their lead from 9-0 to 12-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Brister, only four of eight for 53 yards in the first half, finished 11 of 17 
for 216 yards.

GILDER DECLARED JAPAN WINNER AFTER FINAL ROUND RAINED OUT

<P>
Bob Gilder, leading by one point after three rounds, was declared the winner of 
the $538,000 tournament at Ayamacho, Japan, Sunday after rains washed out the 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
Gilder had 115 points (38-39-38) to 114 for Bob Tway after three rounds on the 
6,796-yard, par-72 Japan Classic Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Gilder earned $73,000. 
</P>
<P>
This was Japan's first PGA tournament using a scoring system that awards two 
points for a par, three for a birdie and one for a bogey. The highest score 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
France's Jean Van de Velde, who led after the first round, tied for third place 
with Japan's Hyoshinori Kaneko and Yoshiyuki Isomura at 113 points. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian-New Zealand PGA team was declared the winner based on total 
strokes after its title match against the U.S. team was rained out in a 
$1-million tournament at Inagi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Australia-New Zealand and the U.S. had 20 points apiece from match victories in 
round-robin play, but the Australia-New Zealand team had the best total stroke 
score, 1,261. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stroke score was not counted because Wayne Levi withdrew because of a 
back injury after playing only nine holes Thursday in the Americans' 
opening-day match against the Europeans. With each individual match victory 
counting two points, Europe beat the Americans, 8-4.

CRIME: POLICE ON FOOT, BICYCLE AND HORSEBACK STRESS CONTACT WITH RESIDENTS. 
THEY SAY VIOLENCE IS DOWN, AND A STUDY FINDS FEAR LESSENED ALSO.

<P>
In a gritty South-Central neighborhood that reported more drive-by shootings 
last year than any other in the city, the Los Angeles Police Department has 
begun shedding its hard-nosed "Dragnet" image for a folksy approach more akin 
to "Mayberry RFD." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to coax wary residents back onto streets they had abandoned in fear, 
officers on foot, bicycle and horseback have flooded the 30 square blocks 
surrounding Hooper Avenue and 41st Street, ringing doorbells, leaving business 
cards and inviting nervous families on evening strolls. 
</P>
<P>
Through a program launched Feb. 1 under the nickname "Operation Cul-De-Sac," 
police have moved away from the hammer-like tactics that have characterized 
recent anti-gang sweeps, and instead have painted over graffiti, hauled away 
trash, attended high school dances and even hosted picnics, complete with 
pinatas and pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that since the program began, crime in the neighborhood has been 
cut 12% compared to the same period last year, from 483 major felonies to 425. 
Drive-by shootings have dropped 64%, from 14 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Residents -- many of whom lived behind barred windows, slept on the floor as 
protection against nighttime shootings and made sure their cars, clothing and 
houses were of a gang-neutral hue -- have gradually begun to unchain their 
doors and reclaim the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real psychological transformation -- both for the police and for 
the residents," said James R. Lasley, a Cal State Fullerton criminal justice 
professor who conducted a study of the program. "The people had become captives 
of their own fear, and the police, instead of perpetuating the fear 
environment, tried to make them feel at home again." 
</P>
<P>
Officers acknowledge that their new tack may seem unlikely for a department not 
exactly known for its down-home geniality. But faced with a 1/2-square-mile 
neighborhood that last year reported 37 drive-by shootings, they decided it was 
time to get back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
In hundreds of other police departments across the country, from Portland, 
Ore., to Houston to Newark, programs placing officers in the role of social 
mobilizer have begun to take hold, according to the Michigan-based National 
Center for Community Policing. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've seen is that the more things of a positive nature that police do to 
interact with the public, the greater the feeling of security," said Hubert 
Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington research group. "If 
people feel safer, they'll use the streets more, and if people use the streets 
more, you have a kind of safety net out there." 
</P>
<P>
Spending more than $250,000 in overtime pay, officials at the LAPD's Newton 
Street Division, the rough-and-tumble area known to the troops as "Shootin' 
Newton," initially assigned 70 officers to the neighborhood. Over the last few 
months, police say the number has been trimmed to about 10 -- still a sizable 
boost over the lone patrol car that used to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most crackdowns, however, the squads were assigned to small sectors of 
the community, where they were instructed to meet the neighbors, make friends 
and try to ease fears. Although officers continued to hunt down suspected 
criminals, they were told the number of arrests was not important. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, they were stereotyping people and harassing them," said Daryl Brown, 
24. "A young black guy like myself can take that in a negative way. But the way 
they're doing it now can be accepted and respected as something positive." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the low-income, racially mixed neighborhood have shown their 
appreciation by baking sweet potato pies for the officers, inviting them in for 
glasses of cold water and shouting "I love you" from their front porches as the 
bike patrols pass by. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole different atmosphere out here," said Sang Brown, a Neighborhood 
Watch block captain who has lived on 40th Place since 1947. "It's a long way 
from being the way I'd like to see it . . . but it makes you feel that at least 
somebody's trying to help you." 
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics fear the gang-banging and crack-dealing will return as soon as 
the police pull out. Others have complained that drug dealers are eluding the 
beefed-up patrols simply by strolling outside the boundaries of the targeted 
area -- 33rd Street and Central, Compton and Vernon avenues. And a few 
residents point out that even increased police attention does not address other 
needs, such as jobs, economic development and a major supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it can really be effective if it is limited to a certain, 
rather small, geographic area," said Ron Dungee, editor of the Los Angeles 
Sentinel, a black community newspaper whose Central Avenue office is in the 
neighborhood. "It sounds good . . . but it's not a cure." 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they want to intensify and expand the program. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, they plan to begin running an after-school tutoring and 
athletic program for about 250 youths, funded by a $150,000 grant from the 
state Office of Criminal Justice Planning. 
</P>
<P>
The two concrete barriers for which the operation is named -- creating dead-end 
streets on Central at 34th Street and 40th Place -- will be landscaped. Eight 
more cul-de-sacs, designed to limit access to the area and foster a sense of 
community on once noisy thoroughfares, are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, officials, who call the neighborhood Reporting District No. 1345, are 
going to ask residents to select a name for the community and post it on signs. 
"Rancho Jefferson," in honor of the local school, Jefferson High, has been 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely a prototype," said Assistant Police Chief Robert L. Vernon, 
adding that the program is not expensive to operate once initial start-up costs 
are funded. "If it turns out as good as some think it will, this could 
revolutionize law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the program's success has been borne out in criminologist Lasley's 
study, which he conducted with a $30,000 grant from the John Randolph and Dora 
Haynes Foundation, a Los Angeles organization that funds social science 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Lasley said that in a telephone survey done in January, a month before the 
program began, he found the residents fearful, intimidated by gang members and 
not particularly impressed by the police presence. He talked to people in 79 
households, or about 10% of the homes in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It had gotten to the point where people had totally reorganized their entire 
lifestyle around this all-consuming fear," said Lasley, who also contributed to 
a recent Claremont Graduate School study of LAPD attitudes. "I called it 
'gangphobia.' Every bit of humanity had been stripped." 
</P>
<P>
Lasley said that when he phoned the people again in September he found a 
different story. When he asked them to measure their fear of being hurt by 
gangs on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being "extremely concerned," the average had 
fallen from 3.62 to 1.95. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they were concerned about their property being damaged or stolen, the 
number dropped from 3.6 to 2.05. Asked, "Is the gang problem in your 
neighborhood getting better or worse?" the response "much better" scored 4.39, 
up from 3.1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Beverly Hills by any stretch of the imagination and probably never 
will be," said Sgt. George Gascon, who is coordinating the operation. "But it's 
a tremendous improvement. We're just trying to break the cycle of fear . . . so 
these people can take back control of their own lives."

MAN IS FATALLY SHOT AT SANTA ANITA; SUSPECT HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man died Sunday, about an hour after he was shot five times by an 
acquaintance on a crowded stairway at Santa Anita Park race track in Arcadia, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita officials said it was believed to be the first shooting in the 
55-year history of the track. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Henry Miller, 27, of Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at 4:23 p.m. 
at Arcadia Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Patterson, 23, of Inglewood, was tackled near the gift shop after the 
3:05 p.m. shooting by several race track security guards and at least two 
spectators. He was being held by Arcadia police without bail on suspicion of 
murder, authorities said. A .380-caliber Beretta semiautomatic pistol was 
recovered, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness, who asked that his name not be used, said that Miller and Patterson 
were arguing on a first-floor grandstand stairway overlooking the pre-race 
walking ring. Horses had left the area minutes earlier and were on the track 
for the sixth race at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the shots rang out, Miller was heard shouting, "Shoot me, shoot 
me," to Patterson, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a dispute between Miller and Patterson "had been simmering for 
several months. The suspect had allegedly sought out the victim at Santa Anita 
with the intention of confronting him." 
</P>
<P>
The stairway where the shooting took place is a popular place for racing fans 
to sit or stand. More than 30,000 people were at the track Sunday and the 
stairs were jammed with spectators, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Track security officer Evelyn Hartsfield said the two men argued before the 
shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned my back, and that's when the shooting started," Hartsfield said. "I 
think the one with the gun waited until I turned around before he started 
firing." 
</P>
<P>
"As close together as people get down there, it's a miracle no one else was 
even hurt," Santa Anita racing steward Pete Pedersen said.

SALON CREATES CINDERELLAS, THEN HELPS FIND PRINCE CHARMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shampoo, a set and thou. 
</P>
<P>
Personne Complet, which claims to be the nation's only combination beauty salon 
and dating service, promises not only to change stepsisters into Cinderellas, 
but also to supply the Prince Charmings. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Boulevard hair salon's dating service brags that it can do more 
than match size 6 blondes to studs in Armani suits. 
</P>
<P>
But if the match goes awry and the prince later turns into a frog, the parlor's 
staff hypnotherapist can help deal with the disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty found love in a beauty parlor as a gigolo stylist in the movie 
"Shampoo." But this shop isn't the creation of a screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was proud of myself for making people pretty," said Daryl Rapoza, 
37, owner of the shop in Woodland Hills. "But then you want to make them more 
than pretty. You want them to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
So Rapoza created the ultimate in one-stop beauty shopping. In one corner of 
her brightly lit shop is a health food bar and a stair-climber exercise 
machine. Nearby is the cloistered office of hypnotherapist Maureen Boyle and 
near the front door is the Macintosh computer that serves as the nerve center 
of the shop's thriving dating service. 
</P>
<P>
Dark-eyed Carole Atkinson, 49, who says her so-called psychic abilities tested 
positive at UCLA, lays out well-used playing cards for readings. The dating 
service she runs began a month ago and is already backlogged. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson charges $50 an hour for a psychic reading, although a free, 10-minute 
reading is provided as part of the dating service. Atkinson feels she brings a 
unique quality to the conventional dating service. "Psychic counseling cuts 
through the social L.A. power plays," she said. She charges each person $35 
when she succeeds in arranging a date. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot more going on in the beauty business than nails and hair," 
Rapoza said. 
</P>
<P>
That appeared to be an understatement on a recent afternoon. As the sound of 
clippers and hair dryers droned busily in the background, a 39-year-old 
businesswoman named Kathy sat down to fill out the 11-page dating service 
questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
She first supplied all the basic information, her height (tall), weight 
(slender), marital status (divorced-and-wiser-for-it), and astrological sign 
(Scorpio). 
</P>
<P>
Then came the more personal questions that will help zero in on her perfect 
mate, such as whether she considered her personality to be "Trashy" or "Neo 
Classic." Asked by Atkinson if she were interested in aerobics, her response 
was not very enlightened. "Don't make it hard on me," Kathy said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she was asked what she would be willing to give up in a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give up anything," she said with the resolve of someone who 
clearly seemed to feel she had given up too much in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a determined person," Atkinson said intuitively. "A lot of men out 
there want women like that." She felt sure she could find a match for Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
For Rapoza, the beauty business came naturally. "I was born knowing how to cut 
hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she was always interested in more than split ends and henna rinses. As she 
cut, she would listen to the tales of her clients. "I watched pretty people 
become ugly" when their lives became painful, and "ugly people become pretty 
just because they fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she sometimes felt guilty at what she had created in her chair. "I 
used to say I've created another monster," referring to a person who suddenly 
looked great but whose inner self was still in need of a makeover. "They turn 
into this gorgeous thing." 
</P>
<P>
She began to believe that "90% of the population is going around half-well," 
and decided to see if she could do something about that. 
</P>
<P>
From a small shop with seven employees, she moved more than a year ago to her 
present location in Woodland Hills, where she now employs 35 people. Besides 
the stylists and body-wrap experts, the staff includes Boyle, the 
hypnotherapist, and Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle is installed in a small office that can be darkened while she gives 
supportive suggestions over a set of headphones to her clients. A tape 
recording of a gentle rain plays softly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, who said she was a concert pianist at the age of 4, has believed 
since her youth in her ability to see beyond ordinary reality. She said she 
used to stand on the corner trying to predict the make of car that would drive 
by next. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until she enrolled at UCLA in the 1960s when interest in psychic 
phenomena was growing, that her abilities were tested as part of a psychology 
class, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until the early '70s that she began doing readings. For years, 
Atkinson refused to take any money for the service, and earned a living as an 
executive for a computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
One gets the feeling that Rapoza has designed her own favorite playground and 
she is one of Boyle's steadiest clients, consulting the hypnotherapist to learn 
how to find pleasure in her life beyond work. And while cutting Atkinson's 
hair, Rapoza may have a reading done. 
</P>
<P>
But, in Rapoza's mind, it is not so much a dating service as a mating service 
that her parlor offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in finding someone a date for the evening," she said. She 
wants to find people a date for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no form of psychotherapy in the world better than a partner," she 
said.

SKIN CANCER GENE IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese researchers have identified the defective gene that causes one form of 
xeroderma pigmentosa, an inherited disease in which sufferers are unusually 
sensitive to sunlight and are prone to light-induced skin cancer. Although many 
people carry the defective gene, only about one in 250,000 actually develops 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
There are believed to be about eight genes that cause different forms of the 
disease. A team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka of Osaka University reported in the 
British journal Nature that they isolated the gene causing the most common form 
of the disease, known as XPAC. It causes about a quarter of all cases. 
</P>
<P>
The defective gene, first isolated in mice and then in humans, is thought to be 
involved in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA, the genetic blueprint 
of life -- damaged by sunlight. Earlier this year, researchers identified the 
gene that causes a rarer form of xeroderma pigmentosa, and scientists are 
currently searching for the remaining genes.

Memories: A recent tour of Vietnam brought back some unpleasant memories for 
actress Audrey Hepburn and strengthened her resolve to increase her efforts on 
behalf of UNICEF. As a teen-ager in Holland at the end of World War II, she 
learned firsthand about foraging for food and the difference international help 
can make. "I was one of the thousands of kids who got packages of food and 
medicine to take home from the Red Cross, UNICEF and CARE," she said.

unexpected twist," was back on the job the next day and surrounded by so many 
congratulatory floral arrangements "it feels like a wedding," he said. Toi's

in Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Trip." Kesey said he plans to donate the 
bus to the Smithsonian Institute, an idea that got a cool reception from 
institute spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs. "The current bus he is using is not 
even close to the original," she said. "Even if it were, the Smithsonian is not

Woe to You, Too: Jackie Gordon is spending the next 30 days in the Tulsa,

Gordon refuses to pay an attorney who helped her win custody of her 
granddaughter. The question now is whether she will pay the $500 fine that went 
along with the jail sentence.

Sometimes a reviewer reads a book and doesn't get it. The reason for that can 
go two ways: Either the writer is at fault or the reader is. Many times a 
reviewer will dither on in the perfect assumption that he or she is right, and 
that the writer has been remiss in this way or that way. The writer has no 
recourse, except to plan an elaborate and usually futile revenge. It's 
important to say here that -- whether or not this particular reviewer "liked" 
this particular book -- an ambitious project has been undertaken and finished. 
</P>
<P>
Melpomene Gilman (named, the reader will notice, for one of the Muses), has 
married her third husband, James, and come to live with him in his beautiful 
but crumbling ancestral home by the side of a lovely bay. Everything is lovely 
here -- the flowers, the trees, the ever-changing surface of the water. And 
Melpomene has found a calling of sorts: She has become the minister to an 
already organized -- but unnamed and undefined -- Christian fellowship that has 
been meeting in a disorganized fashion until Melpomene came up here to take it 
over. 
</P>
<P>
James once had a promising career, but either he or it lost interest, went off 
somewhere. Now he ponders writing a book on a painter with only 12 or so 
paintings to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, James gets up and decides that this is the day he will begin his new 
work. But something, perhaps from his past, militates against this. (I had 
trouble with this. Does James poke moonily about the beach he grew up on, 
unable to do one darn thing, because he's a spineless moron, or because he 
feels badly about having left his last wife for Melpomene, or because he knows 
the project is useless to begin with?) James thinks constantly, about his 
painter, about a girl he used to go out with and about how lonesome he is. 
</P>
<P>
But back in the house, Melpomene wails! Parishioners line up to get their dose 
of platitudinous advice, which Melpomene delivers absent-mindedly today. Her 
old boyfriend, Kuno, is returning from Europe. Melpomene is on an all-day fast 
to be thin for Kuno, but this practice makes her crabby. She keeps putting her 
mouth in a kissing position, rehearsing for when her ex-lover returns. 
</P>
<P>
Melpomene is a very old-fashioned anti-heroine, the kind of fictional woman 
Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf and, especially, Dorothy Parker used to 
deal in. Melpomene is vain beyond words. She's narcissistic to the max. Her 
clothes, her makeup, her lips, are all, all. (But is this the terrible sin that 
the author makes it out to be?) 
</P>
<P>
Melpomene strives for "perfection" in the act of living. Again, her literary 
grandmother is Mansfield's self-deceived wife in "Bliss," or Woolf's crazed and 
suicidal Mrs. Dalloway, or the poor Dorothy Parker heroine alone in a living 
room with a vase of wilting flowers and an indifferent husband, who queries her 
spouse thus: "How do you like my daffy-down-dillies?" 
</P>
<P>
The author detests her heroine. She's not too crazy about her hero either, but 
she detests her heroine. What is the author so incredibly angry about? Yes, a 
lady comes in, asks her pastor for advice, is not listened to closely enough by 
Melpomene, and goes off to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
But in what we might laughingly refer to as the real world, people in the 
"helping professions" make those mistakes all the time. Are we to be angry with 
this lady minister because she loves the way she looks? Because she says mean 
things to her husband? Because she harbors adulterous thoughts? Because she 
tries for perfection and has to settle for imperfection in a big way? (In the 
words of the old joke: "Doesn't everybody?") 
</P>
<P>
Melpomene pretends she lives in Paradise but instead it's her own hell. This 
looks a lot like what we call the human condition. The author's own rage, 
contempt and distaste are separate entities here. To this reader, they blur the 
picture and the message, so that it's quite impossible to know where the lines 
of communication snap or who's at fault here when the novel doesn't come 
through -- the author, or the reviewer.

Artists Protest Helms: Artists Charles Sherman and Cheri Gaulke team up today 
for a free election-eve performance piece answering the question to Sherman's 
controversial billboard campaign, "Who's Burning America?," which points to the 
tobacco industry and its support from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). Helms is in a 
close race for re-election with Democrat Harvey Gantt, an architect and former 
mayor of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke portrays Helms in the three-minute piece, which will be performed at 10 
a.m. at the front entrance of the County Museum of Art. The performance 
concludes when the Helms character torches a painting of the American flag with 
an oversized cigarette. A new Sherman billboard, urging a stop to tax subsidies 
for the tobacco industry, will then be revealed on the side of a truck at the 
museum. CLAUDIA PUIG

INDIGO GIRLS ARE COLORLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Indigo Girls are so acutely earnest that one feels more than a little 
churlish finding fault with them, especially in light of the rapturous 
reception the Georgia folk duo received Saturday night at the sold-out Wiltern 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the glorious, gossamer guitar interplay from the pair, the music 
often rang hollow. 
</P>
<P>
In almost all the compositions, whether written by Amy Ray or Emily Saliers, 
labored, humorless lyrics bog down universally appealing sentiments and pretty 
melodies. Such lines as "My life is part of the global life" and "A moment of 
peace is worth every war behind us" are typical of the dewy-eyed, greeting-card 
verse the Indigo Girls too often deliver. 
</P>
<P>
The show was deficient in form as well as content. Minus the band that sparks 
such spirited tunes as "Hammer and a Nail" on their latest album, "Nomads 
Indians Saints," the Indigo Girls instead relied on the accompaniment of a 
saxophone, a rather ill-advised choice for sing-along-in-school-variety folk 
music. Happily, last year's breakthrough "Closer to Fine" single -- an airy, 
delicate composition with more inventive lyrics than their usual -- still 
sounded, well, close to fine. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the set, anyone possessing an ounce of cynicism could have 
foreseen the encore: a cover of the Youngbloods' 1969 flower-power hit, "Get 
Together," with the word brother changed to sister. The only wonder is that 
they didn't follow it up with "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing." 
</P>
<P>
While less interesting live than on record, the opening act, the Rave-Ups, 
offered tightly wound songs that cleverly temper '60s-style psychedelia with a 
healthy dose of contemporary craft. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

SOVIET PIANIST RATSER IN U.S. DEBUT AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: LISZT, SCHUBERT, RACHMANINOFF ON PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You could just take one look at the program and figure out that the pianist had 
chops. Big pieces by Liszt and Rachmaninoff are not ventured by the faint of 
heart. And given that Dmitri Ratser is a multiple competition winner, you knew 
that there was some whiz-bang virtuosity in store. You wouldn't have been 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Ratser has spent the last decade concertizing and competing inside the Soviet 
Union and the Eastern Bloc. This concert -- in Marsee Auditorium at the South 
Bay Center for the Arts at El Camino College on Saturday night -- was his North 
American debut. 
</P>
<P>
He opened with Liszt's sprawling essay in deviltry, the "Dante" Sonata. He 
played with gusto, from a purely technical standpoint. But he pushed most of 
its grander moments (there are many), pulled at its contemplative ones and the 
piece remained dramatically diffuse. He continued with more Liszt, this time 
Schubert song transcriptions -- "The Maiden's Complaint," "Serenade" and 
"Atlas" -- then the negligible Tarantella from "Annees de pelerinage." Ratser 
distended their melodies until they lost their songful flow. 
</P>
<P>
Ratser's most massive moments remained rhythmically clear and avoided 
brittleness. He insisted on balanced pounding. By this time the piano needed a 
tuning, which it got at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Ratser then offered, by way of virtually no contrast at all, one of 
Rachmaninoff's most overwritten scores, the Piano Sonata No. 2 (revised 
version). 
</P>
<P>
Here, he thundered, dashed, zoomed. But he failed to shape; he didn't swoon. 
When the music got going, he plowed straight ahead, letting the sheer 
accumulation of notes make their impact. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded with the North American premiere of Soviet composer Alexander 
Rosenblatt's Variations on a Theme of Paganini. Set in various jazz styles, the 
variations are geared towards virtuosic display. Ratser played them 
frenetically, bouncing himself into standing position with the final chords.

LONDON CLASSICAL PLAYERS MAKE SOUTHLAND DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society had the good fortune to host the 
Southland debut on Saturday of the hugely successful, controversial London 
Classical Players under conductor Roger Norrington. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington &amp; Co. are part of a movement dedicated to respecting long-dead 
composers' presumed intentions by scraping obfuscating interpretive overlay 
from their scores. 
</P>
<P>
With this particular ensemble there is a difference: Its hackle-raising 
specialty is taking popular 19th-Century repertory -- on Saturday by Beethoven, 
Schubert and Mendelssohn -- rather than the relative esoterica of the Baroque 
and Classical eras and subjecting it to thorough cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
Apparent in the welcoming acoustic of the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
was that the Classical Players sound is less alien live than on recordings. 
Such elements as the (on disc) overbearing shotgun blasts of the old timpani, 
played with hard sticks, retain their impact in the hall but are better 
integrated with the ensemble, while the gut strings sound less pinched, more 
sweetly plaintive, and the brass less raucous. 
</P>
<P>
Balances are just, but instrumental choirs retain their individual timbres and 
the light-toned solo winds sound clearly in Norrington's well-thought-out 
seating arrangement: horns and trumpets (valveless, of course) on opposite 
edges of the stage, basses divided in half over a similar span, winds at top 
center, first violins to his left, seconds to his right. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of orchestral detail heard in Mendelssohn's once-familiar-in-concert 
and, as was proven Saturday, still-ravishing "Scottish" Symphony was startling. 
Here, too, Norrington blasted the canard that he is a compulsive speedster. The 
slow movement sang gently, elegantly, the vibratoless strings' quick attack and 
release maintaining the lyric line where usually their sound hangs endlessly in 
the air, obscuring pitch and impeding momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Norrington and his crew fleetly dispatched Schubert's Fourth Symphony 
("Tragic"), attentive not to the Romantic images conjured up by the nickname or 
imagined Beethoven associations, but rather to the outer movements' ancestry in 
Sturm und Drang Haydn. HERBERT GLASS

LYDIAN QUARTET AT DOHENY MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lydian String Quartet offered a curiously constructed concert for the Da 
Camera Society at the Doheny Mansion on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble, in residence at Brandeis University near Boston, began with 
Faure's melancholy, recondite and rarely encountered swan song, his Quartet in 
E minor. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth hearing, especially in as involved and shapely a reading as the 
Lydian's. But one questions the wisdom of starting an evening's entertainment 
with music so undemonstrative and unlikely to yield up even a fraction of its 
secrets on first encounter. 
</P>
<P>
The tension generated by the subsequent offering, a local premiere of the Third 
Quartet of American composer Lee Hyla (b. 1952), proved somewhat more 
involving. 
</P>
<P>
Hyla's single-movement work, commissioned by the Lydians last year, employs the 
medium cleverly, frequently dividing the foursome into competing pairs of 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
On a first hearing, never conclusive, one recognizes such Bartokian derivations 
as its long tremolos and slashing, sonorous unisons. What this listener did not 
recognize, however, was the composer's announced use of a "rhythmic riff from 
'Fight the Power' by the rap group Public Enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Lydians treated the familiar strains of Schubert's "Death and the 
Maiden" Quartet with respect and freshness of spirit. High marks to the 
ensemble -- violinists Daniel Stepner and Judith Eissenberg, violist Mary Ruth 
Ray, cellist Rhonda Rider -- particularly for presenting the 
theme-and-variations slow movement not as a series of fancy solo turns, but as 
a tautly integrated ensemble piece. HERBERT GLASS

BELLA LEWITZKY COMPANY AT IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program for the Bella Lewitzky Dance Company at the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
on Saturday read like a score card: "Impressions 3," "Episode 1," with the 
words "Game Plan" adding to the illusion of UC Irvine team playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, what seemed statistics and notes on strategy turned out to be dance 
titles, but Lewitzky's athleticism and tactical ingenuity gave the sports 
connection a certain validity -- except that "Impressions" never would have 
outpointed "Episode." 
</P>
<P>
In her ongoing "Impressions" series, Lewitzky responds to stimuli from the 
visual arts: painter Paul Klee in this whimsical 1989 ensemble suite for her 
full, 11-member company. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Dots and Dashes" and "Thither" sections, the dancers wear or carry 
large arrows and other graphic symbols from Klee's works. Indeed, in "Mask," 
Dawn Stoppiello and Walter Kennedy tap-dance while holding a huge cutout face 
in front of them and we see only their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The synthesizer score by Larry A. Attaway often sounds like a music box, 
reinforcing the childlike naivete, though much of the time Lewitzky explores 
Klee's ideas in genuine dance terms rather than settling for cute, arbitrary 
effects and "Pageant of the Masters" pictorialism. 
</P>
<P>
The result looks unfinished, however, like notebook entries rather than a 
cohesive statement. 
</P>
<P>
There's a spectacular solo for Lori McWilliams that inventively deconstructs 
and reassembles ballet batterie, but also a sketchy, unfocused mock-Arabian 
quartet that belongs back in the choreography lab. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, "Impressions 3" looks overproduced, glutted with Klee souvenirs 
but missing his essence: what he called "the reality that is behind visible 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Klee's concept of latent reality informs Lewitzky's newest 
creation, "Episodes 1," the first work in a new low-tech, live-music series 
intended to showcase individual dancers. Working in a stark, early modern-dance 
style that Attaway's piano score strongly parallels, Lewitzky shows a woman 
coming to terms with her past. 
</P>
<P>
After a taut, forceful women's trio on a bench, Lewitzky introduces her 
protagonist, Theodora Fredericks, who interacts with the others and then moves 
away. After they vanish behind a scrim, she expresses her anguish and anger, 
which emotions are calmed in a lyrical, gymnastic adagio with John Pennington. 
He too disappears, but in the end Fredericks finds her way back to all of them 
-- in the memories that this piece so artfully depicts. 
</P>
<P>
Fredericks dances powerfully, but nothing matches the bench trio in its mastery 
of coordinated motion and high-definition imagery. Lewitzky seems to be 
revealing secrets here -- not of her personal life but of a dance era that 
we're taught to revere without fully understanding. Some of us wish she'd never 
go near another art gallery again, but we'd follow her to any bench any time, 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Attaway's piano and drums, "Game Plan" tests the company's 
technique and gives us a glimpse of the dancers as people. This "dance design 
in a game structure" dates from 1973, a period when many American 
choreographers tried to demystify dance. Thus we find difficult, formal tasks 
executed in a breezy, offhand manner and a bare stage gradually transformed 
into a palace of illusion. 
</P>
<P>
As they change from T-shirted individuals to leotarded abstractions, the 
dancers play tag and follow-the-leader. 
</P>
<P>
But when the leader is the coolly accomplished Pennington, the game becomes a 
series of bravura turning jumps and other spectacular feats that leave the 
audience as fundamentally mystified as ever. On stage, virtuosity is magic. 
"Game Plan" proves that demystified virtuosity is simply a contradiction in 
terms.

EARNHARDT WINS, SITS TALL IN DRIVER'S SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: WITH VICTORY AT PHOENIX, HE OVERTAKES MARTIN TO LEAD $1-MILLION 
POINTS CONTEST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Martin's worst fears materialized Sunday in the Checker 500. On a day when 
Martin's team's strategy backfired, Dale Earnhardt drove an intimidating race 
to not only win but overtake Martin in the battle for the $1-million Winston 
Cup stock car champion's bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Once Earnhardt's Chevy Lumina took the lead from pole-sitter Rusty Wallace 
during a pit stop after 50 laps, he was never seriously challenged during the 
rest of the caution flag-ridden race at Phoenix International Raceway. 
Earnhardt led the remaining 262 laps to win $72,100. Martin struggled home 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix officials estimated the attendance at 75,000, the largest crowd in the 
track's history and well over the 60,000 at last year's NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's Ford Thunderbird was running sixth with 15 laps to go when a caution 
flag came out and crew chief Jack Roush called him in for a new set of tires. 
When Martin got back on the track he was 12th and two more caution flags 
prevented him from moving up more than two positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy didn't work, that was obvious," Martin said, "but I was burning 
my tires trying to hold my position, and we had to get a new set. It just 
didn't work out. Now we'll have to outrun them in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran better than tenth all day. We shouldn't have won, but we should have 
had a top-five finish. Things just don't always work out." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who started the day 45 points ahead, is now six behind, 4,260-4,254, 
with only the Atlanta Journal 500 on Nov. 18 remaining. It is the second 
closest points race since the series began in 1971. Only in 1979 when Richard 
Petty overcame a two-point lead by Darrell Waltrip going to the season finale 
at Ontario Motor Speedway was there a closer finish. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Earnhardt's ninth this season against Martin's three, but until 
the past three races Martin had been the most consistent driver in NASCAR's 
premier series. However, after winning at North Wilkesboro, N.C., four races 
ago, he has finished 14th at Charlotte, N. C., 11th at Rockingham, N.C, and now 
10th at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be dominate. We didn't want Mark to score any (bonus) points, and 
things worked out better than we'd hoped for," Earnhardt said. "What we wanted 
to do was come in here, knock him down a few points and head for Atlanta. 
Nothing's changed. We still have to race him for it down there, but we're in a 
better situation, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Five bonus points are given for leading a race and another five for leading the 
most laps. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, who is seeking his fourth Winston Cup championship after winning in 
1980, 1986 and 1987, scored a clean sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming, our getting to the front," Earnhardt added. "If 
we're dominant like we've been down in Atlanta the last couple of races, it'll 
only be fitting that we win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt won the spring race at Atlanta and also last year's Atlanta Journal 
500. 
</P>
<P>
As a final note to a bitter day, Martin's car was involved in a crash after the 
checkered flag when Terry Labonte's car blew an engine on the last lap and 
Martin, Geoff Bodine, Ernie Irvan and Chuck Bown collided when smoke from 
Labonte's engine obscured their view. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see smoke, but I'm running for the championship, and I can't back off 
until I get to the (finish) line," Martin said. "I got on the brakes and 
'wheel-hopped' it, got into Geoff (Bodine) and somebody got into me. It was 
just an unfortunate situation, but nobody got hurt. Only the cars." 
</P>
<P>
The only driver who seemed capable of challenging Earnhardt was Ken Schrader, 
who finished second, 0.67 of a second behind, but the margin was close only 
because of caution flags at the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Our car was real close all day, but we were just a little bit off," Schrader 
said. "You don't win these Winston Cup races when you're a little bit off. My 
hat's off to Dale. His team did a great job, and the way he ran, we're just 
happy to have finished second." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Shepherd finished third, followed in order by Darrell Waltrip, Bill 
Elliott, Alan Kulwicki, Rick Mast, Geoff Bodine and Irvan before Martin 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, last year's Winston Cup champion, led the first 50 laps after grabbing 
the pole Friday with a lap of 124.44 m.p.h. He lost his lead to Earnhardt on a 
slow pit stop, but was still running second when he slowed abruptly on the 77th 
lap because of a blown engine. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the strongest car on the track, but it was just one of those deals you 
get in racing," Wallace said. "No warning, it just blew." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt's winning speed was a rather slow 96.786 m.p.h. because of nine 
caution flags which slowed the pace for 53 of the 312 laps. Earnhardt had the 
fastest lap: 120.080 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious accident occured on lap 49 when six cars tangled in the third 
turn after Shepherd and Bobby Hillin Jr. touched wheels, spinning Hillin 
sideways in the middle of the track. Michael Waltrip slid sideways into Hillin 
and Kyle Petty, with no place to go, slid into both of them. 
</P>
<P>
Hillin and Waltrip were hospitalized, Hillin with multiple bruises and a 
possible neck injury and Waltrip with bruises and a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff (Pancho) Walton, a jackman on Ted Musgrave's crew, suffered a bruised leg 
when Musgrave spun around in the pits, knocking Walton down. 
</P>
<P>
"Our driver came in a little hot, hit the jackman and tossed him in the air," 
explained crew chief D.K. Ulrich. "He came down running, so that leads me to 
believe he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schmitt, veteran Winston West driver from Redding, Calif., won his fourth 
championship by finishing 18th, the highest among the West Coast drivers. 
Schmitt beat Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys, 1,342-1,341, in the closest finish in 
37 years of Winston West racing.

<P>
Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the 
winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and 
Poland's Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women's winner in Sunday's 
race which was plagued by heat and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive marathon victory for each. 
</P>
<P>
Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record 
time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their 
respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
For Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New 
York. It was the first time she had finished the race without winning. 
</P>
<P>
Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no 
American has won the women's division. The last American women's champion was 
Miki Gorman in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The last American men's winner was Alberto Salazar in 1982, when he took the 
title for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second 
consecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in 
the race's 21-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Panfil was timed in 2 hours 30 minutes 45 seconds, Jones in 2:30:50. It was the 
slowest winning women's time since Waitz's 2:32:30 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Wakiihuri, who bolted away at 20 miles, clocked 2:12:39, the slowest since 
Orlando Pizzolato of Italy won in 2:14:53 in 1984, when the temperature reached 
79 degrees, the hottest in race history. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the temperature got as high as 72 degrees and the humidity peaked at 66 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time. 
Bothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The first American finisher was Gerry O'Hara, a 26-year-old New Yorker who was 
29th in 2:26:15. Mohamed Idris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, 
originally was announced as the top American, but race officials later 
determined he was an Egyptian citizen. 
</P>
<P>
It was Wakiihuri's first marathon in the United States and the third for 
Panfil, who did not finish the '88 New York City Marathon, after falling near 
the 16-mile mark and suffering a bruised ankle. 
</P>
<P>
After staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed 
Wakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador 
Garcia of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In only seven previous marathons, the 27-year-old Wakiihuri has won the '87 
world championship, the '89 London Marathon in a personal-best 2:09:03 and the 
'90 Commonwealth Games marathon. He also finished second in the 1988 Olympic 
Games.

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
'PHIN-TASTIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls with a No-Name defense. They went to Super 
Bowls with a defense nicknamed The Killer B's. 
</P>
<P>
But what is one to make of this current bunch, which has given up the fewest 
yards and points in the NFL while racing to a 7-1 record? 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins kept the opposition out of the end zone for the second consecutive 
week Sunday in a 23-3 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. The defense has 
allowed one touchdown in 14 quarters and limited Phoenix rookie Johnny Johnson, 
the NFC's leading rusher going into the game, to 27 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tim McKyer, the former 49er, has been one of the keys to the 
rejuvenated Miami defense. He recently offered these opinions on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On linebacker John Offerdahl: "Johnny Quest? He doesn't have Mike 
Singletary size, but he has Singletary heart." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On cornerback J.B. Brown, a 12th-round draft choice in 1989: "He's playing 
so well, he's taking my Pro Bowl votes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On 270-pound defensive lineman Jeff Cross, who played tight end at 
Riverside City College: "Not only is this guy big, but he's nimble, quick and 
good on his feet. I saw him out there before practice with (wide receiver) Mark 
Duper one day, and he actually covered up Duper on a bump-and-run." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker E.J. Junior, who came to the Dolphins from Phoenix last season, had 
two sacks against his old team, but he didn't care who it came against as long 
as the Dolphins keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm a little strange," Junior said. "Maybe last year it might have 
mattered. But now it's two years later. Times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins certainly hope so. They haven't been to the playoffs since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROAD WORRIERS 
</P>
<P>
The closest the San Francisco 49ers have come to perfection was in 1984, when a 
three-point loss to Pittsburgh on a disputed call was all that separated them 
from an unbeaten season. In their other championship years, they were 13-3 
before the playoffs in 1981, 10-6 in 1988 and 14-2 last year. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team is 8-0 after a 24-20 victory over Green Bay Sunday. The 49ers 
have won 16 games in a row over two seasons and two consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
They must feel tremendously confident about winning the rest of their games, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I think we've been lucky in a lot of games this year," 
tackle Harris Barton said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that we should blow everybody out," Joe Montana said Sunday, "but 
that's not reality." 
</P>
<P>
"Green Bay is a team on the upswing and we are lucky to come out of here with a 
win," Coach George Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have had uncanny success on the road, where they have won a record 14 
games in a row. A look at their streak:

The last road defeat? It came on Nov. 6, 1988 at Phoenix: Cardinals 24, 49ers 
23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland tight end Ozzie Newsome caught three passes against Buffalo, moving 
him past Charley Taylor into fourth place on the NFL's all-time reception list 
with 651 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers moved past John Hadl into fifth place on 
the NFL's career pass yardage list. Montana passed for 411 yards against Green 
Bay and has 33,599 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Washington tied an NFL record for first downs by recording 39 in a 41-38 
overtime victory over Detroit. . . . Washington's Chip Lohmiller has kicked a 
field goal in 28 consecutive games, which ties him for second on the NFL's 
all-time list with Jim Turner. Fred Cox holds the record at 31 games. . . Art 
Monk caught at least one pass for the 108th game in a row. . . . Detroit hasn't 
beaten Washington since 1965, six months before Lion quarterback Rodney Peete 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon's 43 passes increased his career total to 2,815, breaking the 
Houston Oilers' club record of 2,784 set by Hall of Famer George Blanda. . . . 
Ram quarterback Jim Everett threw his 100th touchdown pass, a two-yarder to 
Damone Johnson in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta has lost 14 consecutive road games dating to a 12-6 victory over the 
Raiders in 1988. . . . Pittsburgh's defense hasn't allowed a touchdown in eight 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins are 7-0 against the Cardinals and 9-0 at home against NFC East 
teams. . . . Miami's Pete Stoyanovich made field goals of 19, 21 and 19 yards 
to extend his streak without a miss to 13. He's 12 for 12 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Barry Sanders rushed for 100 yards on 10 carries, the first back to 
gain 100 yards against the Redskins since Week 11 of last season when Bobby 
Humphrey of the Denver Broncos picked up 110. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Neal Anderson has scored a touchdown in seven games in a row against 
Tampa Bay. . . . Buccaneer first-round draft pick Keith McCants had his first 
sack of the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL FIGURE 
</P>
<P>
The AFC Central is usually one of the tightest races in the NFL. This season is 
no different, with the Steelers and Bengals tied for the lead at 5-4 and 
Houston at 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
The division takes next week off, but things will heat up again when Pittsburgh 
and Cincinnati meet twice in the next three games -- a Sunday night game Nov. 
18 at Cincinnati with a return date Dec. 2 atPittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Is Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll excited? Just ask him. 
</P>
<P>
From his postgame press conference after the Steelers defeated Atlanta, 21-9: 
"We're tied for the division lead? Cincinnati lost? Good. You can quote me on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PARITY PARODY 
</P>
<P>
Going into the weekend, it was easy to tell the good teams from the bad ones. 
Only nine of the 28 teams had records over .500. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, there was only one matchup of teams that both were over .500 (the 
Raiders at Kansas City). There were six matchups of plus-.500 teams against 
sub-.500 teams, and the rich really got richer. The winners won five out of 
six, the only exception a 21-7 victory for New Orleans (2-5) over Cincinnati 
(5-3). 
</P>
<P>
A side effect, of course, is some pretty glossy records. San Francisco is 8-0, 
the New York Giants are 7-0, Buffalo, Miami and Chicago are 7-1 and the Raiders 
are 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Deion Sanders on the Falcons' 3-5 record: "We've lost only one or two 
games all year. The other ones we won. (The other games), they just had more 
points than we did." 
</P>
<P>
Miami linebacker John Offerdahl on the Dolphins' 7-1 start: "It's a fairy tale. 
It's true, though." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati safety David Fulcher, who suffered a separated shoulder in the 
Bengals' 21-7 loss to New Orleans: "When things start going bad, they stay 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason: "I don't think I've ever felt this low 
as a professional athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Terance Mathis of the New York Jets on his 98-yard punt return, tying an NFL 
record: "I went back to catch the ball over my shoulder, looked down and saw 
the end zone. I said, 'Whoa, I've got to do something with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Charles Haley, on Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski: "We had 
to try to take that rabbit out of his hat before he could pull it out on us." 
</P>
<P>
Washington quarterback Jeff Rutledge, who threw for 362 yards after entering 
the game in the third quarter and rallied the Redskins over Detroit, 41-38 in 
overtime: "The first thing I did was pray. It was 35-14 when I went in there. I 
said, 'Good Lord, let me go in there and relax and come back and take it a 
little bit at a time.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Denver quarterback John Elway hurt his toe after leading the Broncos to a 16-0 
first-half lead against Minnesota and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas tackle Mark Tuinei left the game against the New York Jets in the first 
quarter with a sprained knee and defensive lineman Mitch Willis had a 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jet quarterback Ken O'Brien bruised his left shoulder and sprained his 
right thumb, but the Jets said he probably would not be listed on the NFL 
injury report. New York safety Brian Washington sustained a sprained toe. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati safety David Fulcher separated his right shoulder against New 
Orleans and will be out for four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit quarterback Rodney Peete suffered a hamstring injury in the third 
quarter and did not return against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK GIANTS at INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
<P>
Time: 6 p.m. TV: Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
This shapes up as one of the worst Monday night matchups in recent years. Even 
Hank Williams Jr. and his rowdy friends will have trouble working up much 
enthusiasm for a game pitting one of the NFL's best teams against one of the 
worst. Not too mention that the bad team is down to rookie Jeff George, 
40-year-old Joe Ferguson and castoff Rusty Hilger at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
New York, off to its best start ever at 7-0, is second in the NFL in total 
defense, first in pass defense and has a plus-nine turnover ratio that tops the 
league. Phil Simms is the league's top-ranked quarterback, throwing only one 
interception while passing for 1,165 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
George, the top pick in the draft, is making his first start in five games. He 
has been intercepted six times and sacked nine times. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, who will be playing in his third game since coming off the 
non-football injured list, has only 82 yards in 19 carries for the Colts.

<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever it takes to win, the San Francisco 49ers continue to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana passed for 411 yards and three touchdowns Sunday as the the 49ers 
beat the Green Bay Packers, 24-20 -- the 49ers' 16th consecutive victory over 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to knock us off and it's not an easy road for us," Montana said. 
"You have to accept that and face the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that we should blow everybody out, but that's not reality." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers were the last team to beat the 49ers, a 21-17 setback last Nov. 19 
at Candlestick Park. The 49ers have won 14 in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"At first things didn't go right, but then we came back," said Jerry Rice, who 
gathered in a pass from Montana and took off to complete a 64-yard, 
fourth-quarter touchdown pass play that gave San Francisco a 24-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers improved to 8-0. Green Bay fell to 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
"Green Bay is a team on the upswing and we are lucky to come out of here with a 
win," said 49er Coach George Seifert. "I knew that coming in here after they 
beat us last year it was going to be a real challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who completed 25 of 40 passes, moved past John Hadl into fifth place 
on the NFL's career passing yardage list. Montana, who has 2,545 yards this 
season, has 33,599 in his career, not counting post-season play. The all-time 
leader is Fran Tarkenton, with 47,003. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was at his best at the end of the first half Sunday. The 49ers had the 
ball on their own 41 with 38 seconds left, following a Packer touchdown and a 
short kickoff. It took Montana only three plays and 27 seconds to score. 
</P>
<P>
Montana passed to Tom Rathman for seven yards, to Rice for 29 and then 
connected with John Taylor on a 23-yard touchdown pass play to cut a Green Bay 
lead to 10-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't been doing anything offensively," Montana said. "We got good field 
position (on a short kickoff) and it changed the momentum for us." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Montana passed six yards to Brent Jones for a touchdown with 12:45 left 
to play. It gave the 49ers their first lead at 17-10 and completed a 42-yard 
drive that began after a short Packer punt. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay then drove to the 49ers' 12 but had to settle for Chris Jacke's 
37-yard field goal with 8:17 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
A minute later, Montana completed a pass to Rice over the middle and he 
sprinted past the Packers' defense to make it 24-13. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay came right back, moving 72 yards in just two minutes, with Don 
Majkowski passing to Sterling Sharpe for 17 yards and a touchdown, cutting the 
lead to 24-20. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers got the ball back with 2:12 left and no timeouts, but Green Bay's 
Perry Kemp fumbled after a pass reception with 1:48 to go -- the only turnover 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We proved we could play with anybody and still be in the game," Majkowski 
said. "The 49ers just did not make as many mistakes this year as they did in 
the game last year in Candlestick." 
</P>
<P>
Packer Coach Lindy Infante said, "It wasn't like we got blown out 35-0. Great 
teams figure out ways to win games and the 49ers did." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 274 yards, moved the Packers 66 
yards in 10 plays late in the first half, completing six of seven passes, 
including a 20-yard touchdown toss to a fully extended Sharpe in the corner of 
the zone. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 10-0 with 38 seconds left in the half, but, after the short 
kickoff by Jacke, Montana needed only 27 seconds to cut the lead to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer's 22-yard field goal tied the game at 10-10 with 2:48 left in the 
third quarter.

NEWSWIRE: SIXTEEN PLAYERS TO BECOME NEW-LOOK FREE AGENTS, FEHR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen players will be made so-called new-look free agents for a six-to 
eight-week period that probably will begin in January, Players union executive 
Donald Fehr said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball owners have agreed to settle the collusion cases with a payment to the 
players' association that will total $280 million Jan. 2, several agents and 
lawyers familiar with the agreement have said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, the 16 players will be given the chance to leave their 
teams and become free agents again. 
</P>
<P>
The players are the Angels' Chili Davis, San Diego's Jack Clark, Detroit's Jack 
Morris, Atlanta's Charlie Leibrandt, Boston's Larry Andersen, Detroit's Mike 
Heath, Houston's Danny Darwin and Dave Smith, Minnesota's Juan Berenguer and 
Gary Gaetti, Montreal's Dennis Martinez, the New York Yankees' Dave LaPoint and 
Mike Witt, Oakland's Dave Henderson and San Francisco's Brett Butler and Mike 
LaCoss. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, in Tokyo for baseball's goodwill tour, confirmed the broad outline of the 
agreement, but declined to get into details. 
</P>
<P>
A source involved in the deal confirmed that the sides settled on the 
$280-million figure and the new-look free agency in a handshake agreement Oct. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
The source, who declined to be identified, said that all other details of the 
agreement will have to be worked out before it can be presented for 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Sunday night that he still wants to return to the Padres, 
apologizing for his previous comments ridiculing the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres previously offered Clark a one-year contract for $2.5 million with 
an option year at $2.5 million. Clark angrily rejected the offer, chastising 
the organization for making it.

BANKE PUTS HIS TITLE ON LINE TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Banke will defend his World Boxing Council super-bantamweight championship 
for the second time tonight in a 12-round bout at the Forum against Pedro 
Decima of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
In his only title defense, Banke (20-4) stopped Lee Ki-Jun Aug. 18 at Ichon, 
South Korea. In typical, come-from-behind Banke fashion, he was bleeding and 
down on points when he stopped Lee in the last round. 
</P>
<P>
Decima (25-2) is the No. 1-ranked WBC contender and the title fight will be his 
first.

A HARD LESSON; 
</P>
<P>
FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN, GETTING AN EDUCATION IS A CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term homeless conjures up many images: disheveled drifters trudging through 
downtown Ventura, drunken men sleeping it off in Oxnard's Plaza Park, 
weather-beaten women panhandling at grocery stores in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
What may not leap to mind are images of children -- homeless kids struggling to 
learn despite frequent absences and moves from school to school; children 
skipping school to baby-sit while their parents look for work; children who 
face taunts and snickers when the school bus stops at the campground where they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 4,000 homeless people living in Ventura County, about a third 
are school-age children, according to county social workers. Although many of 
them attend school, lack of a stable home makes getting an education almost 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody focuses very well on academics when their lives are in chaos," said 
Nancy Nazario, homeless ombudsman for the Ventura County Public Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Nelsen, principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Ventura, said that last 
year he had a pupil from a homeless family who had attended 18 schools. She was 
only in the third grade. 
</P>
<P>
"She was performing at kindergarten level in reading and math but was obviously 
average in intelligence," Nelsen said. He said school officials and social 
workers helped the girl's family find a permanent residence in Lincoln's 
attendance area so she could stay at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is in fourth grade at Lincoln and is performing almost at the 
appropriate level for her age, Nelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
But many more homeless children continue to come and go at Lincoln, which has 
one of the highest transient rates in the county, Nelsen said. Only two-thirds 
of the students stay for an entire school year, he said. The other one-third 
turns over 3 1/2 times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln gets a lot of homeless children because it is near motels on Thompson 
Boulevard where the county puts up welfare families, Nelsen said. E.P. Foster 
Elementary, De Anza Middle School and Ventura High School also have significant 
numbers of homeless students, district officials said. Homeless students also 
attend schools in Oxnard and Ojai, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
The term homeless, according to the federal government, applies to anyone who 
lacks a "fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence." The definition takes 
in people who live in congregate shelters, welfare motels or anywhere not 
ordinarily used as a permanent dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes Lot 37 at Camp Comfort County Park near Ojai, where Dale 
Schmidt, Shirley Chambers and their four children have eked out an existence 
since July. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived, camp manager Barbara Warfield recalls, "it was like 'The 
Grapes of Wrath.' " The family, which lives on Schmidt's $140-a-week disability 
checks and Chambers' $86-a-week welfare grants, had been evicted from a house 
in Ventura. At first, they slept in their two old cars. Then somebody gave them 
a tent. Finally they acquired a small one-room trailer where all six sleep -- 
Schmidt and Chambers on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"With four kids, it is very rough," said Schmidt, a roofer who injured his back 
three years ago. "I don't consider myself homeless. It's better than sleeping 
in the car." 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, their son Michael, 7, daughter Renee, 6, and about 10 other 
children who live at the campground board a school bus for Mira Monte 
Elementary School just outside Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
For Michael, a second-grader, it's his second school. He spent first grade at 
E.P. Foster and liked it better than Mira Monte. "My teacher at Foster was real 
nice, and I can't go there any more and visit her. I'm sorry I had to leave 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Monte isn't too bad, he said, but "one kid in my class says Camp Comfort 
is a stupid place to live." 
</P>
<P>
The principal at Mira Monte, Larry Hartmann, said the children from the 
campground are "a good bunch, considering their living conditions, the hubbub 
of the campground and all. Their parents seem to be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
One problem, he said, is that the school can't call the parents if a child from 
the campground becomes sick or has some other problem at school. Another 
hindrance is a county rule that forbids staying at the park more than 30 
consecutive days. One night a month, each family at the park has to stay 
somewhere else, and sometimes the kids miss school, Hartmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably a higher rate of movement and they're less likely to finish a 
school year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelsen at Lincoln Elementary said homeless schoolchildren have to deal with the 
stigma of being poor. "It affects their image of themselves," he said. "Often 
they only have a couple of outfits of clothing, and they're wearing the same 
thing all the time. For some, it's hard to get showers and clean clothes." 
</P>
<P>
And it's harder to feel comfortable in class, he said. "They move so much, it's 
difficult for them to develop friendships and feel that they fit in." 
</P>
<P>
Social workers and education officials say the districts have flexible 
enrollment policies for homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to have a home" to enroll, said Michael Sellwood, director of 
administrative services for Ventura Unified. "We have had homeless families 
living in the parking lot of the district office. If people move here for a 
week and want to enroll, we enroll them." 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Union High School District offers independent study programs or 
alternative school enrollment to homeless students, Assistant Supt. Gary Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, officials say, is lack of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing is the only way to solve the problem," said Nazario, the county social 
worker. "To set up education programs without stable housing, why bother? I 
think the schools will have a difficult time until these kids are housed 
stably." 
</P>
<P>
The parents of homeless families usually want their children to go to school. 
"They know the value of an education," Ventura Unified teacher Beverly Thanos 
said. "They've gone without it." 
</P>
<P>
Thanos has encountered many homeless children in nearly 40 years of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they are in class, they often are not functioning," she said. "The 
fear of being thrown out of your house, no food -- all of these things take 
just an unbelievable toll on a child's life." 
</P>
<P>
Thanos is a "home teacher," an instructor who normally teaches in the houses of 
children with broken legs and other physical problems. She has followed 
families from campground to campground, park to park, even into other school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never a chance for those cherubs to go through a whole school year," 
she said. "I've seen several children who started in school, were doing 
beautifully, then they couldn't pay the rent so out they went. I never saw them 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"It just crushes you to see these kids not having a chance." 
</P>
<P>
It also makes her mad, Thanos said. "All we're doing is perpetuating this 
welfare thing. How are they going to get off it without an education?" 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Comfort, Schmidt and Chambers say they expect Lot 37 to be home for 
several more months, and Michael and Renee will probably finish out the school 
year at Mira Monte. 
</P>
<P>
It will take at least that long before they can come up with the first and last 
month's rent, a deposit and utility fees needed to move into a house that will 
accommodate a family of six, Schmidt said. "It's going to be tough to get out 
of here." 
</P>
<P>
That suits Michael just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"There's mountains to climb and stuff," he said, as he pedaled a bicycle with a 
flat tire along a dusty trail. 
</P>
<P>
But Renee, who was watching television in a neighbor's trailer the other day, 
said she misses the house they had in Ventura. "The kids on TV with houses and 
stuff, that's what I want," she said.

EPA RULES ON AIR WILL BE APPLIED OFFSHORE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A HOUSE AND SENATE COMPROMISE WILL PUT 19 OIL PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL 
WATERS UNDER STRICT POLLUTION STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials have won a lengthy battle to bring offshore oil 
operations under the same strict air pollution standards that apply to 
industries onshore. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, engineered by the heads of air pollution control districts in 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, for the first time brings offshore 
platforms and their supply boats under air quality regulations set and enforced 
by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, included in a compromise Clean Air Act package worked out by 
the House and Senate late last month, means cleaner air for Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties, said Richard Baldwin, Ventura County air pollution control 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
After President Bush signs the law later this month, the offshore provision 
will also provide more equitable treatment for industry as a whole, requiring 
all polluters to contribute to efforts to clean up Southern California's smoggy 
air, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura County has a serious air quality problem from ozone," Baldwin said. 
"Emissions from offshore oil platforms contribute to that, just as your car 
does, or the Edison power plant when you turn on your light switch." 
</P>
<P>
Oil platforms within the state's three-mile limit are already governed by local 
air quality standards, but those rules do not apply to the 19 platforms in 
federal waters off Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
Once the bill becomes law, the Environmental Protection Agency will have one 
year to draft regulations for the offshore platforms in federal waters. The 
agency will probably transfer enforcement of the program to local air pollution 
control districts, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will probably result in the addition of new emission-control 
technology at some of the 19 platforms, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure could also cause compliance problems and extra expense to the 
offshore oil industry, said Michael Wang, manager of operations and environment 
for the Western States Petroleum Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If EPA chooses to delegate the regulatory powers to the counties, it sets up 
the potential for patchwork regulations with differing controls depending on 
whether the platform is offshore one county or another," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
The association also argued before the Senate Energy Committee that total 
emissions from offshore operations are small compared to pollution from onshore 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
But William Master, assistant director of the Santa Barbara Air Pollution 
Control District, said that argument is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they contribute 1% or 10% of the total emissions, it is not equitable 
to exempt some sources of pollution and control others," Master said. 
</P>
<P>
The typical large offshore oil platform is a small community that depends on 
fuel-burning generators not only to pump oil but also to provide electricity 
for workers. Smog-producing emissions from a single platform routinely exceed 
600 tons a year, Master said. 
</P>
<P>
Master said the emission levels are lower on some platforms, where the state or 
local air pollution control districts have required pollution-reducing 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
Those interventions came only after the districts objected to new installations 
and delayed the projects with appeals to the California Coastal Commission. 
Under the new regulations, the oil companies will know early on what their 
emission control requirements will be, he said.

SHE WENT FROM PLAYING ON THE COURTS TO A COURTHOUSE CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONS: COLLEAGUES QUESTIONED WHETHER ASSISTANT D.A. COLLEEN TOY WHITE 
JUMPED THROUGH ENOUGH HOOPS TO GET HER JOB, BUT FEW CRITICIZE HER TODAY.

<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White grew up on the dusty plains of 
Oklahoma, a gangly high school basketball player with no higher ambition than 
to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
Then she started a family, moved to the mountains and orange groves of Ventura 
County, and discovered she loved working in the courts more than playing on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In seven years, White rose from law clerk to the $90,000-a-year job she has 
held since late 1983 as second in command of Ventura County's prosecutors, 
right-hand woman to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
Now 46, she oversees fraud and environmental prosecutions, supervises the child 
support division and victim-witness support unit, and acts as district attorney 
in Bradbury's absence, overseeing more than 80 attorneys and nearly 400 staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud unit is responsible for prosecuting major cases such as the trial of 
Ojai minister Robert J. Brancato, accused of bilking investors out of $1.6 
million, and the grand jury investigation into allegations that billionaire 
developer David H. Murdoch had improper relationships with county officials and 
reneged on promises to the Lake Sherwood community. 
</P>
<P>
As assistant district attorney, White finalizes all her prosecutors' charging 
decisions and sits on the committee that decides whether to seek the death 
penalty in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
She also serves as spokeswoman for the office and oversees recruitment, 
budgeting, personnel and the office's other administrative functions. 
</P>
<P>
She co-founded a program to help victims of domestic violence get restraining 
orders against their attackers without having to pay legal fees, and she serves 
on committees dealing with rape, domestic violence and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In what spare time she has, she enjoys playing tennis, shopping, and fixing up 
the house she bought in Camarillo last year. 
</P>
<P>
Few people are willing to criticize White -- not, they say, for fear of her 
clout, but for lack of cause. What criticism there is has little to do with 
White herself, but with her swift rise to power. 
</P>
<P>
Some deputy district attorneys were resentful when Bradbury appointed her 
because they had far more trial experience than the two years she had at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But Municipal Judge Barry Klopfer, who worked with White as a prosecutor in the 
late 1970s, said, "Even if you're the sourest of sour grapes, it's hard to 
remain sour when somebody's doing such a fine job." 
</P>
<P>
James M. Farley, an attorney who has defended clients against charges from 
White's deputies and considers himself her friend, said he recalls prosecutors 
asking, "Why did she get the job when other people, more experienced people, 
wanted it?" 
</P>
<P>
"But since she's been out there, I think she's been doing a good job," Farley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he appointed White "25% for her experience, 25% for her 
abilities, 40% for her interpersonal skills as a manager and 10% for our 
friendship." He added that he appointed Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. 
O'Neill Jr. in 1984 for many of the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I had friends in the office who said, 'We think you're making a mistake. 
You're passing up people with experience for people who don't have that much 
experience,' " said Bradbury, who also had only two years of experience as a 
prosecutor when he was appointed assistant district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Toy has never disappointed me in her ability to manage." 
</P>
<P>
White said she had never heard the complaints, "but I'd be naive to say that it 
surprises me. . . . If people had those feelings, I never felt they manifested 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Toy White is a far cry from the little girl who grew up 
in Wetumka, Okla., a town of about 1,000 people. People have been calling her 
Toy since she was a day old and her brother suggested naming her after a friend 
whose name her mother liked. 
</P>
<P>
"My older brother looked at me and said, 'She looks just like a toy,' " she 
said. "I got a lot of rhymes growing up, like 'Toy, Toy, big tall skinny boy,' 
and around Christmastime it causes me some grief. But I've been called it all 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
Her father was a Wetumka policeman. She remembers chauffeuring him to the jail 
in the back seat of the family car, with his prisoners in the passenger seat 
next to her. 
</P>
<P>
"These were not hardened criminals," she recalled. "We'd get to the door of the 
jail and my dad would pat 'em on the back, shake their hands and give them a 
dollar for a pack of cigarettes on the inside. The kids, when they got in 
trouble, he'd talk to them. He was a real gentle guy." 
</P>
<P>
But White did not yearn to be a cop. Her only ambition was to coach her 
school's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The summer after her junior year, the 16-year-old White married a 23-year-old 
customer of the restaurant where she worked. By the end of her senior year, 
they had their first child, Misty Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
The family moved to Ventura County in 1968, when Misty was 6 and the couple's 
son, Kevin Blaine, was 3. White said, "We really came to California for the 
classic story -- better opportunities," but she also was glad to be closer to 
her family, which was and still is scattered around Southern California. White 
and her husband divorced during her third year in law school in Ventura County, 
but they remain friendly today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The seed for law school was planted during her sister's divorce by the 
ineptitude of a family lawyer whom White remembers as "a real incompetent 
bozo." 
</P>
<P>
"I was there just to support her and I ended up doing some of the strategy and 
legal research," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She found she liked the work. So she enrolled in the Ventura College of Law, 
feeling confident she could learn the law, but still needing to overcome her 
innate shyness -- a trait that is all but invisible today. 
</P>
<P>
White wanted to be a public defender, but she needed to scout the enemy camp by 
working briefly for the district attorney's office. After a few months of 
assisting prosecutors, she knew she had found her calling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was politically a liberal and socially I still am," said White, who is 
registered as a Republican. But after talking to crime victims in the district 
attorney's office, "I thought, 'This is really who you need to be protecting.' 
You think that a certain number of the populace ought to be in jail." 
</P>
<P>
White remembers doing legal research for prosecutors in a room over the old 
jail on Poli Street where, even late at night, the curses and screams of 
prisoners rose through her office window "like some old Jimmy Cagney movie." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury recalls White being assigned to escort a 6-foot prostitute throughout 
the trial of a local attorney accused of shooting off one of her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Before court every day, district attorney's investigators brought the woman 
straight from the Los Angeles streets to the courtroom without letting her 
change out of her working clothes. 
</P>
<P>
White begins to smile, remembering the defendant's toughest day in court, when 
"we had the prostitute, his wife, and the girlfriend in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
She chuckled. "See why we love this job? Most people have to go out and buy 
magazines. We don't have to do that. We just come to work every day." 
</P>
<P>
White worked as a legal researcher for the district attorney's office during 
the summers of l976 and l977, at the end of which she received her law degree 
and passed the bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1978, she began working as a prosecutor in the misdemeanor division. 
</P>
<P>
"To say I was green was really the understatement of the year," White recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The first people she prosecuted were a man accused of harvesting undersized 
clams and a girl whose crowing rooster was disturbing the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The rooster case was resolved peacefully through negotiation. The clam case got 
a little messier. 
</P>
<P>
The clam digger acted as though he were threatened with the death penalty, 
White recalled. On the day of trial he walked into the courtroom and dumped a 
load of frozen clams onto the counsel table, where they began to melt -- and 
stink. 
</P>
<P>
When White won the case a few hours later, the man "gave me a look that is 
reserved only for vermin and prosecutors who have just convicted you of taking 
undersized clams off the beaches of Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1978, Bradbury asked White to help run his campaign for district 
attorney. "We were both political novices," White remembers. "He'd never run 
for office and I'd never been involved with a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But Bradbury won the runoff and the final election, and he has held the office 
ever since. By early 1979, White had moved into the consumer fraud division to 
prosecute the swindlers, chiselers and snake oil sellers of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, White helped start the office's consumer mediation unit, which uses 
laymen as mediators to settle small-claims disputes and free the courts to 
focus on more serious cases. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1984, when then-Assistant Dist. Atty. Ray Sinatar resigned, Bradbury 
appointed her to replace Sinatar. 
</P>
<P>
White said she and Bradbury are a close match. "It's very comfortable working 
for someone who wants to protect the environment, wants to protect the people 
in the community." 
</P>
<P>
She has considered seeking a judgeship or, if Bradbury leaves office, running 
for district attorney. But she is quite content for now. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world as assistant D.A."

BIRTH CENTER DELIVERS WOMEN NEW OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's newest site for having babies won't feature the stainless steel 
ambience of an operating room, but neither will its rooms look like those of a 
Rancho Bernardo resort. 
</P>
<P>
Its primary birth practitioners will be highly trained professionals with 
lengthy medical backgrounds, but they won't be obstetricians. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the 100 to 150 babies born there each month will have poor mothers, 
but they won't have lacked for medical care during their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if the idea for The BirthPlace works, this Hillcrest alternative birth 
center could show the private sector how to help solve the problem of women who 
cannot obtain health care during their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
The secret, believes Dr. William H. Swartz, is to minimize technological 
intervention, maximize efficiency of medical services and use certified 
nurse-midwives to assist with normal deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that low-risk patients deliver in a low-technology environment, 
but not at home," said Swartz, who left the UC San Diego faculty in July to set 
up The BirthPlace. He remains a clinical associate professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Out-of-hospital birth centers used to exist in the United States. They exist 
throughout areas of Europe, and I believe they're the wave of the future in the 
United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swartz suspects that cost-savings pressures will hasten the day when -- just as 
outpatient surgery centers mushroomed over the last decade -- out-of-hospital 
birth centers attended by midwives will become the norm rather than the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the largest health maintenance organization in San Diego, Kaiser 
Permanente, is using nurse-midwives for 45% of its births. Naval Hospital San 
Diego also has a midwifery service that is undergoing expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's births are done in the hospital, but building an out-of-hospital birth 
center nearby is "an option that we're investigating," said Dr. David Preskill, 
chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have very reasonable control on our costs, but there are still good 
reasons to consider out-of-hospital birth centers," Preskill said. "They are 
less expensive to build, and they offer a potential for providing a setting 
which is perhaps more comfortable for low-risk patients." 
</P>
<P>
Swartz agrees. But the real fuel for his dream has come from many years of 
attending to San Diego's "no-cares" -- women who show up in the emergency room 
to deliver their babies, having had no prenatal care. There were nearly 4,000 
such births in San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that every person has a right to be born under warm, friendly, 
healthy circumstances," he said recently. "The basics of childbirth should be 
available to all before the luxuries are given to a few." 
</P>
<P>
But normal, uncomplicated births don't belong at high-technology hospitals, he 
says: "You don't build a neighborhood market in the middle of Horton Plaza, 
because the fruit is going to be quite expensive." 
</P>
<P>
It was Swartz who wrote the proposal a decade ago to address San Diego's 
no-care problem by beginning the Comprehensive Perinatal Program, or CPP, at 
UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's Reproductive Medicine Department announced in mid-October that it was 
ending the program. After controversy, the hospital and medical school 
administration began negotiating to continue it under the auspices of community 
clinics. No final plan has been announced. His experience with CPP gave him the 
basic structure for the new birth center: using midwives both for 
education-oriented prenatal care and for low-technology deliveries. 
Obstetricians will deliver only high-risk or Caesarean-section babies. 
</P>
<P>
"You begin with the fact that in 80% or 90% of pregnancies the outcome can be 
expected to be perfect for mother and baby. Perfect. You can't improve on 
perfect," Swartz said. "It is this group of low-risk women with which the 
midwife rolls up her sleeves and gets to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Her job is to provide a natural, culturally sensitive, noninterventionist type 
of experience which attends to the personal, emotional needs of that particular 
family unit. 
</P>
<P>
"And at the same time she is a highly trained birth attendant. She is an 
constant and careful observer for safety, to make sure that this isn't one of 
the patients who falls into the 10% or so in whom the outcome might not be 
perfect without some obstetric intervention." 
</P>
<P>
In those latter cases, the women can be transferred to UCSD or Mercy hospital 
for Caesarean-section deliveries, he said. The center's location, on two floors 
of a building at 4094 4th Ave., is intended to allow a 10-minute transfer to 
either facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's Preskill said 10 minutes is short enough to meet most obstetricians' 
concerns about safety of nonhospital births. "Even if you're just down the hall 
from an operating room in a hospital, it can take that long," Preskill said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, birth centers remain controversial with many obstetricians, 
who say they worry about deaths among babies and their mothers if they aren't 
in a hospital, said Dr. Michael Rosenthal, an Upland obstetrician and birth 
center operator. 
</P>
<P>
A study published last December in the New England Journal of Medicine provided 
the first large-scale comparison between childbirth outcomes at birth centers 
and at hospitals. Looking at 11,814 women admitted to 84 free-standing birth 
centers, the study concluded that infant mortality was no higher than in 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are so good that I don't believe we can continue to dismiss this 
idea," Swartz said of the study. 
</P>
<P>
The BirthPlace's planned structure is a blend between a private medical 
practice and the CPP that Swartz helped found. Currently, Swartz and two other 
obstetricians, Dr. John Sanchez and Dr. Christopher Lafferty, see patients in 
an office building sandwiched between fast-food restaurants in Mission Valley. 
A fourth obstetrician, now at Harvard University, is to join the practice early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the 30-member staff also includes a variety of specialists, some drawn from 
the CPP model: 
</P>
<P>
* A nurse-midwife, Cindy Dickinson, who is overseeing licensing and birth 
services to be given by eight to 10 midwives. 
</P>
<P>
* Two nurse-practitioners, Melinda Bender and Victoria Tueros, whose duties 
respectively will be to give well-baby care of the children until age 1, and 
family planning information to their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
* An administrator, Janice Bluemer, who formerly helped administer Medi-Cal for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
* A nutritionist, a health educator, a social worker, a patient advocate, and a 
staff member whose sole duty it will be to help women negotiate Medi-Cal red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
After remodeling that begins this month, The BirthPlace is scheduled to open 
Feb. 1 in a Hillcrest office building. The medical offices will occupy one 
floor, and another floor will have homelike labor-delivery-recovery rooms able 
to handle 100 to 150 births a month, a much larger capacity than usual for an 
out-of-hospital birth center. 
</P>
<P>
Swartz said he is aiming for half the patients to be funded through Medi-Cal, 
and the rest through cash or private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Like every other program aimed at helping the poor, however, The BirthPlace's 
biggest problem may be its financial underpinnings. Swartz admits that he knows 
of no other birth center in the state, all of them smaller than his, that takes 
Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Swartz said he and the other obstetricians have put perhaps $200,000 of their 
own money into the start-up, and said the practice is "breaking even" with 
about 50 deliveries a month, now done at UCSD. Funding also has come from small 
foundation grants, and further grants are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
"In principle, I think you need birthing centers. The problem is you can't fund 
it through Medi-Cal," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he doesn't take Medi-Cal patients, or even patients from health 
maintenance organizations, because these sources don't reimburse enough to keep 
a birth center operating. 
</P>
<P>
Total reimbursement for Medi-Cal birth was raised over the last two years to 
$2,155 for prenatal care plus the delivery. The BirthPlace also will be able to 
collect a facility fee allowance from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he wonders, too, if the plan's finances could be further skewed 
if private-insurance patients succumb to class snobbery. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to run a practice that is a mix of middle-class clientele 
and people who are using Medi-Cal. The Medi-Cal tend to drive the middle class 
out of the waiting room," Rosenthal said. "I'm not in favor of this. It's 
simply what I've observed in my own practice." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Swartz and colleagues hope a homey, relaxed childbirth atmosphere will 
attract privately insured patients. They will be competing against luxurious, 
high-technology facilities recently opened at Grossmont Hospital and Alvarado 
Hospital Medical Center, and another being built at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're having a baby, you want to have it in a nice environment. However, 
there is a certain level of niceness which is beyond that and gets into 
luxury," Swartz said. "I don't think stained oak floors are necessary, or add 
to the childbirth experience." 
</P>
<P>
In an indirect way, he added, such features add to the problem of no-care 
deliveries by eating health care dollars that could be better spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to knock Grossmont and Alvarado. I think they have truly 
beautiful facilities, and I believe in LDRs (single labor-recovery-delivery 
rooms) and the direction they're heading," Swartz said. "But if you try to 
insist that all patients deliver in that environment, the health care system 
can't pay for it. Only the wealthy can pay for it."

PHONE CALL LEADS DEPUTIES TO ABDUCTED WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nightgown-clad woman allegedly abducted Saturday by her ex-boyfriend was 
rescued after calling authorities on the 911 line -- from the house next door 
to where she was abducted. 
</P>
<P>
"Sonny is watching. 
</P>
<P>
I can't talk," Donna Marie Maloney, 36, of Encinitas told dispatchers when she 
called shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday. She had reportedly been abducted Saturday 
by Wilmer (Sonny) Evans Hart Jr., 43, of Encinitas, moments after originally 
calling 911 for help. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney's call on Sunday was traced and found to be coming from a house in the 
130 block of Phoebe Street in Encinitas, at a house next door to where Maloney 
was allegedly abducted. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived, Maloney told them Hart was in a house at the rear of the 
property. Hart fled and is being sought. He is described as white, 6-foot-3 and 
210 pounds with blondish-gray, shoulder-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney was in good condition Sunday night, said Sgt. Roy Stamper of the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the two have had a tumultuous relationship and that Hart was 
under a restraining order, issued last Sunday, not to contact Maloney.

CITY MAY SEEK HELP WITH SHELTER SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard housing officials have recommended that the City Council pay a 
consultant $10,000 to identify nine potential locations for a homeless shelter 
within the city. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation will be considered by the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The locations identified by the consultant are to be considered as future sites 
for the Zoe Christian Center, the county's only year-round homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said the center cannot remain at its South Rose Avenue site 
because of its proximity to a fertilizer plant where toxic chemicals are 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the council, Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said the consultant 
will be chosen through a bid proposal process and will be paid with federal 
grant money. 
</P>
<P>
The task will be coordinated with the city of Ventura, which will also identify 
potential sites within that city, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative effort has been endorsed by the Assn. of Ventura County Cities, 
which has agreed to support development of a shelter operated under a joint 
powers agreement among all the cities, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Once all the sites have been identified, they will be reviewed by city 
officials in Oxnard and Ventura for final approval, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The new shelter should be about 10,550 square feet and should serve 180 to 200 
people, according to a city report. HUGO MARTIN

<TEXT>
<P>
A 47-year-old Ventura man was killed when the gun he was cleaning accidentally 
discharged, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wayne Glaze was pronounced dead at his house at 8:45 p.m. Saturday, 
Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
The death appeared to be accidental, Isaac said. An autopsy is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Glaze's 15-year-old son, Fred, called police to report the shooting, Ventura 
Police Cpl. Mike Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
When Foster arrived at the house in the 300 block of South Santa Cruz Street, 
Fred Glaze was still on the phone talking to police dispatchers. Foster found 
Larry Glaze lying on the floor upstairs next to a bed. Foster said he found a 
pistol of unknown caliber with a rag pulled partially through the trigger 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Glaze told police that he had last seen his father, a warehouse worker and 
truck driver for Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., between 7:30 and 8 p.m. when he went 
to clean his guns, Foster said. CAROL WATSON

TEMPLE LEADER'S SLAYING LEAVES FRIENDS BAFFLED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DAYS AFTER ANITA GREEN SAW THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF A LONGTIME DREAM COMING 
TRUE, SOMEONE WALKED UP TO HER CAR AND SHOT HER DEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, Anita Green stood poised at the threshold of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 7, after seven years of relentless organizing, hoping, fighting and 
praying, she was witnessing the groundbreaking for the home of Temple Shir 
Chadash -- The New Reform Congregation -- in Woodland Hills. Although some 
members of the temple's board thought it would be better to wait, Green wanted 
to go forward with the groundbreaking. Her resolve eased others' fears and, as 
usual, she was able to bring everyone together. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 synagogue members and friends turned out for the ceremony and 
celebration. Using a shovel from Auschwitz, Green and her mother, Riva Rice, a 
Holocaust survivor, dug into the earth. It was a spiritual, emotional event. 
Even the children cried. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks later, congregation members came together again -- to 
bury Green, their founder and president, who was shot to death Oct. 25 and 
whose killing remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
On that Thursday, at midmorning, Green had just pulled into the parking lot at 
the rear of her estranged husband's business in North Hollywood when she was 
shot by a man who witnesses said had been following her on a motorcycle. Los 
Angeles Police Detective Michael Coffey said police have questioned Melvin 
Green, Anita Green's husband, as well as friends, neighbors and witnesses to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
This past week, Councilwoman Joy Picus said she will ask the Los Angeles City 
Council to offer a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the murderer. Temple Shir Chadash vowed to match that reward. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends say they are still trying to make sense of the violent death 
of a woman who was so well-loved. 
</P>
<P>
Green, 42, came to prominence in her community as leader of the new synagogue, 
which started in 1983 as an idea hatched over a glass of wine among friends. 
</P>
<P>
As the congregation grew, it moved from meeting at private houses and in 
storefronts into Woodland Hills Community Church. In 1986, Green spearheaded a 
controversial plan to develop part of 17 1/2 acres the temple began leasing 
from Pierce College, as a way of financing a permanent home for the 
congregation. A developer would build 24 residences on 12 acres subleased from 
the temple. 
</P>
<P>
Three years of court battles with the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization 
ensued as the homeowners group tried unsuccessfully to block the development. 
Its president, Bob Gross, said any effort to link the group to Green's death 
would be outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very good person. It's a tremendous loss," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Green's interests and energy took her beyond the Jewish community and 
personified what the temple's Rabbi Steven Jacobs describes as the values of 
new Reform Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very spiritual person, not in the sense of orthodoxy or observance, 
but as defined by mitzvot" or good deeds, he said, referring to her work for 
human rights in Central America and the reform movement in Israel. "That is 
what I call a religious person." 
</P>
<P>
Green's mother, who was very close to her daughter, saw another motivation for 
her zealous efforts. Her marriage of nine years was falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to see the unhappiness in her face, but she never told me what it was," 
Rice said. "I assume that's why she got so involved in something else . . . 
because her life was so unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
In July, Green had filed for divorce from Melvin Green, her second husband, a 
54-year-old tax consultant. Janis McDonald, Anita Green's attorney, said the 
couple were "as different as day and night." 
</P>
<P>
Green had worked as an accountant for her husband's tax consulting firm, but 
when the marriage broke up, the separation agreement called for her to work out 
of an apartment she had rented, going to the office only to pick up or drop off 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and McDonald, the divorce proceedings had been contentious. 
McDonald said her client feared her husband but desperately tried to settle out 
of court so they could both get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"She was loyal, concerned about his business, didn't want to hurt him. It 
wasn't in her nature to," McDonald said. Attorney Marian Stanton of Encino, who 
represented Melvin Green in the divorce, declined to comment. Arthur Alexander, 
who Green retained after initial questioning by police, was out of town and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Green was heading to her estranged husband's office at the corner of 
Oxnard Boulevard and Wilkinson Avenue by prior arrangement on the morning of 
her death. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said several witnesses saw Green driving on Oxnard Boulevard, her red 
1985 Corvette followed so closely by a motorcycle that it appeared as if it 
would collide with her. She pulled into the four-car parking lot behind her 
husband's building at 10:20 a.m. Before she could get out of the car, the 
motorcyclist had stopped at the curb, gotten off the cycle and walked to her 
car. He shot her once in the upper torso with a handgun and sped away on the 
red or maroon Suzuki racing bike. The exact type of gun has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
The police have released a composite drawing of the suspect and described the 
killing as "intentional and premeditated." They are interviewing witnesses, 
knocking on neighbors' doors and waiting. "We believe that that individual who 
killed Anita Green has talked to somebody, or someone knows that person," 
Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey acknowledged that, along with several other leads, the police consider 
her husband a suspect in the murder. "It's a divorce situation and I'd be 
foolish to say he wasn't," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Encountered outside his office, Melvin Green spoke angrily about the events of 
the past few weeks. Imposing in stature, he was wearing a traditional Jewish 
black mourning ribbon on his yellow cardigan. He said he feels people are 
unfairly pointing a finger at him and that he has been going through "holy 
hell," but that nothing people can do to him now is worse than what's already 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
He said that despite their differences, he loved his wife. "All I can say is, 
when I saw them giving her first aid, I would have changed places with her," he 
said, referring to the day his wife was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Jacobs said he and Anita's only son, Scott, 22, spent an entire night 
last week trying to think of motives, reasons, something that would help make 
sense of her death. 
</P>
<P>
"People from the congregation have been calling me to say how much they need 
the temple now as a place to pray, to share their fears, their hopes and their 
tears," Jacobs said.

A two-alarm fire damaged a computer chip manufacturing company, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out about 2 p.m. 
Sunday at the Techna Vision company at 11463 Woodside Ave. The fire, which 
caused $500,000 in damage, was contained within 45 minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said an overheated thermostat in a vat of plating material inside 
the two-story building was the cause of the blaze.

CHARGERS PUT A MUZZLE ON SEAHAWKS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: ALL QUIET ON THE SEATTLE FRONT AFTER LEWIS' PUNT RETURN, MILLER'S 
FUMBLE RECOVERY SPARK FIRST CHARGER VICTORY IN KINGDOME SINCE 1980. 
</P>

<P>
They yelled, they booed, and the noise rained down upon the Chargers in the 
Kingdome again, but this time 59,646 fans were only whispering sweet nothings. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1980 when Dan Fouts was the starting quarterback and punt returner 
Nate Lewis was a youngster of 14, had the Chargers enjoyed such serenity in the 
raucous Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Chargers muzzled the local screamers and broke a 7-7 tie with 24 
consecutive points, including Lewis' 63-yard punt return for a touchdown, and 
overran the Seahawks, 31-14, to snap an eight-game losing streak in the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"They were telling me that people didn't think we could win here," Lewis said, 
"so we came here to prove them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (4-5) had lost three games in a row to Seattle and 10 of the last 
12, but this one was over before they changed ends in the fourth quarter. The 
Chargers had a 31-7 lead, and the Seahawks (3-5) were trying to cross the 
50-yard line for only the second time all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, one of the best things about this win is to see the way that 
our special teams did the job," linebacker Billy Ray Smith said. "Because 
that's always been Seattle's trademark. They assume immediately they are going 
to win that phase of the game outright, and boy, our guys took it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' touchdown return, the first for the Chargers since 1987 when Lionel 
James went 81 yards against the Cardinals, came with 43 seconds remaining in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one in college at Georgia against Clemson for 73 yards," said Lewis, who 
was a seventh-round pick from Oregon Tech after transferring from Georgia. "All 
I had to do was get past the kicker, and no kicker is going to tackle me. That 
would be embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, projected to make his living in the NFL as a wide receiver, became the 
team's punt returner only last week after Scott Schwedes was released. 
</P>
<P>
He now has run back seven punts for an average return of 14.8 yards; New York's 
Dave Meggett began the weekend as the NFL's leading punt returner with an 
average return of 13.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed to part the inside blockers and he did it to perfection," said 
Larry Pasquale, special teams coordinator. "Whether he knows it or not, he did 
a little wiggle, and that's the wiggle we're looking for to shake him free. 
That's a tremendous feat against a team like that." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' punt return became a harbinger of disaster for the Seahawks. Defensive 
lineman Les Miller fell on a Dave Krieg fumble in the end zone 32 seconds 
later, and in less than a minute, the Chargers had two touchdowns, and a 31-7 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were still in the game when we were down 17-7," Seattle Coach 
Chuck Knox said, "but then in a short span of about three plays they get 14 
points." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Leslie O'Neal forced the fumble, and was credited with a 30-yard 
sack. But he would also have been credited with the touchdown had the ball not 
squirted out from under him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a scoring machine," Miller said after swiping the ball from O'Neal, 
and collecting the third touchdown of his career. He recovered a fumble earlier 
this season in the end zone against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and did the same 
thing against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks had won three of their last four games, and were coming off a bye 
week. And at times, it appeared they all hadn't returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The bye didn't have anything to do with it," Knox said. "The bye didn't return 
a punt on us. The bye didn't miss a tackle or miss a block or anything like 
that. They just beat us, and that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' defense limited Tampa Bay to 157 yards, eight first downs and 
two-of-10 in third-down conversions a week ago. They gave up 194 yards to the 
Seahawks, and Seattle converted only three of 10 third-down opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a big difference when our offense controls the ball like they did," 
linebacker Gary Plummer said. "And then we went out there, we did a good job of 
stopping them on first down and putting them in long-yardage situations. In 
those situations, we're at our best." 
</P>
<P>
While the Chargers' defense sacked Krieg four times and forced an interception, 
the offense was rolling. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, who have scored on their first possession in seven games, went 72 
yards in 11 plays to earn a 7-0 lead. Running back Ronnie Harmon, left 
unguarded on a safety blitz, took a short pass in the flats, then went 11 yards 
for the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks drew even early in the second quarter on running back John L. 
Williams' zig-zag 21-yard touchdown run. Williams appeared to be pinned down 
for a loss after taking a pitch and running right, but he reversed himself and 
ran across the field to post his first rushing touchdown against the Chargers 
in eight meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers took possession, they went ahead to stay on Billy Joe 
Tolliver's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Quinn Early. It was the 
Chargers' longest completion of the season, Early's first touchdown since 1988 
and the longest reception of his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the sideline and I told Billy I needed justice," Early said, after a 
diving catch in the first quarter at the goal line was negated by an official's 
ruling that the ball had hit the turf. "So he came back to me on the post 
pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver said he would have been looking for Anthony Miller on the play, but 
the Seahawks came with the blitz. "At least, I think they were blitzing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, who was six of 17 for 41 yards with an interception in his NFL 
starting debut in Seattle last season, was 11 of 24 for 145 yards with two 
touchdowns Sunday. He has now thrown 94 passes in a row without an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers moved to the Seattle two-yard line on their first possession of 
the second half, and kicker John Carney extended the team's lead to 17-7 with a 
20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
A restless crowd began booing their heroes a few moments later after Lewis took 
Rick Donnelly's 46-yard punt and returned it the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the new streak of the '90s," Plummer said. "That's something Dan 
(Henning, coach) emphasized all week. It had been kind of a joke among us that 
the 1990 Chargers had not lost in the Kingdome, but I think a lot of guys took 
it to heart."

The coach sat in his chair with a remote control in his hand and a critic's 
look on his face. 
</P>
<P>
It was late Sunday afternoon, a day after San Diego State's 66-14 whipping of 
Utah, and Coach Al Luginbill was watching film of his team's first victory 
since late September. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't complete jubilation -- that's not the way football coaches work. No, 
Hawaii comes to town next, and Luginbill stayed up late Saturday night scouting 
the Rainbows' 43-16 victory over New Mexico. There is always another game, 
another obstacle to keep the mind working one week ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But for a few minutes Sunday, he didn't look ahead. He reflected on the Aztecs' 
most dominating performance since they defeated UC Santa Barbara in 1970, 64-7. 
He called it the best overall performance in his 19 games at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team played with an extreme amount of enthusiasm," Luginbill said. "From 
the first snap to the last, they enjoyed playing the game of football. We never 
got sloppy. That has not been the mode of operation here. In the last two years 
when we've gotten comfortable, we have lowered our intensity, which lowered our 
execution, which didn't make us look good." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (3-4, 2-2 in the Western Athletic Conference) had hit the skids late 
in the game of each of their previous two victories this season. In a 38-21 
victory over Cal State Long Beach, they had a 21-3 halftime lead before 
becoming sluggish in the second half. The 49ers matched the Aztecs' 17 
second-half points in that game. Two weeks later, SDSU led Air Force after 
three quarters, 45-9, but got sloppy in the fourth quarter. The Aztecs ended up 
winning, 48-18. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, however, SDSU was consistent throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our kids are sensitive to the fact that they're a pretty good football 
team with nothing to show for it," Luginbill said. "Now, they're on a mission. 
They have something to prove, and anybody who gets in their way is going to pay 
dearly. Utah happened to be there." 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which has collapsed frequently this season, turned in its best 
performance of the year. SDSU held Utah to 200 yards in total offense, the 
fewest allowed since SDSU held Brigham Young to 167 in 1986. Utah was the first 
team that did not gain at least 300 yards against the Aztecs this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start for us," Luginbill said. "We're moving in the right direction as 
a team. What I appreciate about the offensive kids is that all year, they have 
really supported (the SDSU defense). It shows a type of character, empathy, or 
whatever you want to call it, for their teammates. They compete against these 
kids all week in practice and see how hard they try." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill got quite a bit of satisfaction from Saturday's victory, but it was 
not enough to take his mind off this Saturday. There is always another game, 
and more to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's game, Luginbill challenged the Aztecs to put together two 
consecutive weeks of solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing we would like to see is to come out Saturday night with an 
outstanding defensive performance, because it builds," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Always planning, always plotting. But for a few brief moments, Luginbill 
thought about his team's dominating performance over Utah, and he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's defense moved from 106th -- last -- to 103rd in Division I total 
defense, allowing 465.1 yards a game. The Aztecs are 101st in scoring defense, 
having allowed 36.1 points a game. SDSU ranks fourth in both passing offense 
(333.9 yards a game) and scoring offense (41.3). Quarterback Dan McGwire is 
third in the nation in passing efficiency (148.2), trailing Virginia's Shawn 
Moore (166.4) and BYU's Ty Detmer (158.9). McGwire is fifth in total offense 
(297.2). Patrick Rowe leads the nation in receiving yards per game (120.4) and 
Dennis Arey is sixth (106). 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's opponent next week, Hawaii (5-3, 2-2), pounded New Mexico, 43-16, late 
Saturday behind Jamal Farmer's 115 rushing yards and three touchdowns. New 
Mexico, the Aztecs' opponent Nov. 17, fell to 2-8, 1-4. Hawaii's defense forced 
seven New Mexico turnovers. Linebacker Mark Odom led the Rainbow defense. He 
had two sacks, two tackles for losses, an interception and a blocked extra 
point in little more than three quarters. Odom was also in on eight tackles.

THE JACKS ARE BACK AND AS GOOD AS EVER WITH BLUE AT HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Comebacks can be a real pain, particularly for a rock band with as rich a 
legacy as the Jacks. Between 1986 and 1989, they consistently tore up local 
nightclubs with their steamy "blue-eyed soul" originals, and in 1988 released a 
brilliant album on the Rounder Records label, "Jacks Are Wild," that never got 
the attention it deserved. 
</P>
<P>
The Jacks regrouped over the summer, some six months after their dissolution 
last December, because singer-songwriter-guitarist Buddy Blue landed a solo 
deal with Rhino Records and needed a band to back him in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
And now that Blue's solo album, "Guttersnipes 'n' Zealots," is in the can -- 
it's due out next February -- the resurrected group is once again plying the 
local nightclub circuit. The only changes are the replacement of original 
bassist Chris Sullivan with Michael Davis, formerly with fellow local rockers 
Secret Society, and a rechristening as Buddy Blue and the Jacks. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the group played its second reunion gig at Bodie's downtown. 
The members not only lived up to their legacy, they enhanced it. Instead of 
simply dusting off their old tunes, they polished them up and made them shine 
like new. As for the cleverly crafted new songs, from Blue's upcoming solo 
album, they played them with the enthusiasm and excitement of a kid opening 
presents on Christmas morning. And just for the heck of it, they threw in a 
handful of electric blues standards that added even more sizzle to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Davis, keyboardist "Mighty" Joe Longa and drummer Jack DiMatteo were 
already on stage when Blue -- dressed all in black and looking like a cross 
between those two TV monster sitcom kids, Eddie Munster and Pugsley Adams -- 
swaggered up to join them. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the first song, a cover of the Blues Project's "Can't Keep 
From Crying," Blue broke a string on his guitar. The accident put him in a 
rather churlish mood that continued all night long, but hey, what else is new? 
Blue has always been the quintessential temperamental artist, and his little 
tantrums have almost become an expected part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Next came two new tunes. "Saturday Night" is a raucous party anthem punctuated 
by Longa's soulful organ bursts. "No Right to Die" is a real tear jerker in the 
guise of an angry, ferocious rocker ala the Yardbirds' "Evil Hearted You." It's 
about the death of Blue's father, apparently written during the anger phase of 
the mourning process ("You sleep in peace while I'm sentenced to live"). 
</P>
<P>
Then came the bluesy ballad "Missing You," off "Jacks Are Wild." The song is a 
particularly good showcase for Blue's warbling tenor vibrato; he doesn't hold 
notes, he gargles with them -- and the effect is something so passionate, so 
heartfelt, that it brings chill bumps. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening wore on, the dance floor filled with a most diverse selection of 
people: punkers, rockers, yuppies, even an elderly black man nattily clad in a 
red-and-white seersucker suit with a red tie and carnation. Quite appropriate, 
considering that the Jacks' music -- essentially a throwback to the 
intoxicating, bop-till-you-drop rhythm-and-blues of the 1960s -- is a real 
musical melting pot. White rock, black soul -- the Jacks have made it one and 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Lazy Blues" included an incredible lead guitar solo by Blue, and a few 
songs later, on another new tune, "The Duke of J Street," something of an ode 
to machismo, he again made chop suey of his frets. Blue's guitar playing has 
improved immensely. 
</P>
<P>
About midway through the show, sound problems prompted the Jacks to take a 
brief break, which only compounded Blue's surly mood. When they returned, they 
performed spirited renditions of several classic electric blues tunes, 
including Johnny Winter's "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Williams, the lead singer of local funk band Sharkskin, joined the Jacks 
on the vintage Smokey Robinson dance tune "Mickey's Monkey." Then they left the 
stage, only to be called back for an invigorating blues jam with hot guitarist 
Willie Jaye, who had opened the show for them. 
</P>
<P>
The new model of the Jacks -- er, Buddy Blue and the Jacks -- is also an 
improved model. They've not only come back, they've come back with a vengeance.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: SOUTHWESTERN BACKPEDALS ON OUSTER OF 
METZGER SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southwestern Cable Television has shifted into backpedaling mode, a week after 
deciding to use a technicality to try to take white supremacist Tom Metzger's 
program off its community access channel (Channel 16). 
</P>
<P>
Cable systems throughout the country have balked at airing Metzger's 
hate-filled "Race and Reason," which he uses as a recruiting vehicle for his 
White Aryan Resistance. But legally a show cannot be taken off community access 
simply because of content. Only programs that are blatantly commercial or 
obscene can be refused. 
</P>
<P>
However, Southwestern officials thought they might have discovered a way to 
take Metzger off the air after a Portland jury recently decided Metzger had 
incited his followers to murder a student. A section of Southwestern's 
franchise agreement with the city of San Diego makes it clear the community 
access channel is meant to be available only to "responsible persons," although 
it doesn't offer a definition of responsible. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Sunday, Southwestern decided not to air the scheduled program of 
"Race and Reason," citing the Portland verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe (Metzger's) irresponsible actions as evidenced by the jury's 
verdict coupled with our franchise agreement constitutes grounds for removal of 
the Metzger and White Aryan Resistance-produced program," Southwestern director 
of public affairs Jeffrey Van Deerlin told the San Diego Reader. 
</P>
<P>
It was a novel and potentially groundbreaking concept. Even if Metzger sued and 
won, such a case could have gone a long way toward defining the parameters of 
community access. 
</P>
<P>
"The freedom to speak does not carry with it the right to incite violence that 
may hurt people," Van Deerlin's father, former Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin, 
wrote in Thursday's San Diego Tribune, paraphrasing Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
However, before the Reader and Van Deerlin's column had hit the streets, 
Southwestern was already backing off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking a look at the interpretation of the franchise and public access 
requirements and what transpired in Oregon," Southwestern president Ann Burr 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While Southwestern is "reviewing" the franchise agreement, the system will 
likely continue to air "Race and Reason," Burr said. She offered no explanation 
for the turnabout, except to say the Reader article "jumped the gun." 
Southwestern has had no contact with Metzger about the issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Van Deerlin said "in-house counsel is taking a closer look" at the 
legalities of the Metzger issue. 
</P>
<P>
"They're grasping at straws," Metzger said when reached Friday in Fallbrook. He 
said he was unaware of the attempt to take the show off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Although franchise agreements vary from cable system to cable system and many 
don't include the word "responsible," other systems are investigating whether 
the Portland verdict may give them a justification to drop the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely intriguing," said Cox Cable spokeswoman Sandy Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Could KNSD-TV (Channel 39) have had something other than community service in 
mind when it decided to broadcast live from the Betty Broderick murder trial 
last week? Why, only the most cynical observer would suggest that the station 
was simply using a sensational trial as an attention-getting stunt. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the station didn't consider that its coverage just happened to begin on 
the same day as a key ratings sweep period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure coincidence," Channel 39 general manager Neil Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick is not exactly Roe vs. Wade, but it's more steamy and controversial 
than the soap operas that Channel 39 preempted for the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important, based on the fact it's a high-profile case," Derrough said. 
"No one can recall a trial that generated any more discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Live coverage of sensational trials is becoming relatively commonplace, 
especially on CNN and C-Span. There is "extreme local interest" in Broderick 
and the issues it raises about divorce and relationships, Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the local affiliates don't get that much revenue from daytime soaps. 
Why not put it on the air? If the live coverage contains more than a few 
unedited expletives, and the newspapers choose to write stories about the 
station's coverage during a ratings period, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
Derrough said Channel 39 expects to continue the coverage today, following the 
Broderick trial to its bitter and sensational end. 
</P>
<P>
The National Hispanic Media Coalition has asked the Federal Communications 
Commission to deny license renewals to 13 California radio stations, including 
three in San Diego, for failing to employ and recruit enough Hispanics and 
other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
KIFM (98.1) and KFMB-AM (760) and FM (B100) are the stations named in the 
action. KFMB's sister station, KFMB-TV (Channel 8) has had its license upheld 
for more than year, after its minority hiring practices were challenged by 
groups representing blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance of these 13 stations is an embarrassment to California," said 
NHMC counsel Robert Thompson in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, KIFM is the worst Hispanic employer with only one of 29 
employees Hispanic," the release states. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned," KIFM general manager Bruce Walton said, when informed of the 
action. "Since we took over the station (a little more than a year ago), we 
have made 22 hires and 10 of the 22 have been minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Only 6.8% of KFMB's work force is Hispanic, according to the release. KFMB 
general manager Paul Palmer, who also was not aware of the release, had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
A race to watch: the Birch ratings for September show KKLQ (Q106) falling to an 
8.1 share, down from 14.3 in March. Meanwhile, XHTZ (Z90), which is trying to 
compete for Q106's huge teen dance audience, moved from a 1.5 to a 5.1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Things are looking up for "Seniors Speak Out," the KPBS-produced talk show 
focusing on the concerns of the over-50 set. First producer Wayne Smith was 
rehired, after being laid off earlier in the year. Then the staff learned that 
the series is being picked up by 16 stations, with more likely to follow suit. 
The show, which airs Sundays at 5 p.m., also received a grant recently from the 
FHP Foundation, an independent grant-making organization that specializes in 
senior health care. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In George Chamberlin, Channel 39 actually has found someone capable of 
discussing financial topics in an articulate fashion. . . .

BULGARIAN PIANIST DELIVERS AN UNCONVENTIONAL GRIEG

<P>
From the brutal opening chords of Juliana Markova's Grieg Piano Concerto, it 
was clear that her approach to the familiar concerto would be anything but 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian pianist's muscular, high-voltage performance proved to be a great 
crowd pleaser at the San Diego Symphony's Friday night Copley Symphony Hall 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, an idiosyncratic view of Grieg that remained at odds with 
custom and with the genial but disciplined direction of guest conductor Vernon 
Handley. Markova was in the driver's seat, even though Handley held the baton 
on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Markova demonstrated a wide range of keyboard techniques, including a seamless 
legato and a refreshingly flexible sense of rubato in quieter sections. She is 
a clearly virtuosa of formidable technique. But her shameless, thundering 
fortes -- which made the orchestra's Steinway sound brittle and strident -- and 
her willful distortion of the work's contours came close to caricature. The 
distance between Grieg and Rachmaninoff is much greater than she imagines. 
</P>
<P>
Handley redeemed the evening with a sympathetic, probing reading of Elgar's 
First Symphony. A British conductor who was until recently the principal 
conductor of the Ulster Orchestra, Handley has specialized in the music of his 
fellow countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
For the Elgar symphony he chose broad but unflagging tempos that kept the 
work's inner tension clearly focused. The orchestra warmed to the composer's 
dense textures and irregular motives, providing an appropriately burnished, 
majestic sonority. Notable was the deep, covered timbre from the brass and 
horns. 
</P>
<P>
In a new configuration on stage, the strings displayed admirable blend and an 
improved overall balance. Handley placed the second violins at the front of the 
stage to his right, moving the cellos back to where the second violins usually 
sit behind the first violins. This arrangement, unusual for today's orchestras 
but not without historical precedent, deserves further testing. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Overture to "Prometheus" opened the concert on an uncertain note. 
Fortunately, midway through the work, orchestra and conductor met on common 
ground and pulled together for a respectable finale.

WILSON SAYS HE WANTS TO UNITE ALL CALIFORNIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
Denying he is the candidate of the rich, Republican Sen. Pete Wilson denounced 
Dianne Feinstein's last-minute campaign rhetoric Sunday as "a little pathetic" 
and accused the Democratic candidate of cynically trying to divide 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said as he toured the San Joaquin Valley with the rest of the GOP 
statewide slate that he intends "to be a governor for all Californians, to 
unite them and to lead them." 
</P>
<P>
During a traditional train ride up the same valley Saturday, Feinstein espoused 
a populist message that the election of Democrats would best serve the 
interests of working men and women, rather than cater to the rich and to 
powerful special interests, as she claimed the GOP would. She harked back to 
every underdog's hero, Democratic President Harry S. Truman, who pulled out a 
stunning upset victory over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson hedgehopped the valley by chartered jet, stopping at Bakersfield, 
Fresno and Modesto, he denounced such talk as "the tired, stale bromides of the 
1930s," a reference to the rich-vs.-poor rhetoric of the Great Depression, 
which brought many of today's prosperous San Joaquin Valley farmers to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still running against Herbert Hoover," Wilson said of Feinstein and 
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
But as both campaigns moved toward Tuesday's election, Wilson said that the 
economic populism argument is wrong. The Democratic-sponsored tax bills that 
were part of the recent federal budget settlement, he said, will hurt the 
middle-class, working taxpayer more than any other group. At the day's first 
stop, a get-out-the-vote rally in Bakersfield, Wilson lashed out against 
Feinstein's most recent campaign message, declaring: 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's something a little pathetic in a campaign that depends on 
dividing -- and dividing the city against the rural areas and the rich against 
the poor and black against white. I think that, frankly, is a losing tactic 
that deserves to be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
Then, at Fresno, Wilson played tit for tat by inviting the so-called Reagan 
Democrats to remain with the Republican Party and vote for him even if they do 
not choose to change their party registration. 
</P>
<P>
Another Feinstein appeal has been to the conservative Democrats who deserted 
the party in 1966 to vote for Ronald Reagan for governor and have since 
repeatedly helped elect Republicans as governor and president. She has argued 
that working men and women are paying the price for Reagan economic policies of 
the 1980s that favored the rich, and that it's time for them to return to the 
Democratic fold. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that Reagan Democrats are just as interested as other Californians 
in his major campaign themes -- streets that are safe from crime, low taxes and 
the educational reforms that will give every California child a chance to 
excel. 
</P>
<P>
"They are as concerned as you are for the future of California," said the 
57-year-old former San Diego mayor, who seemed confident of being elected to a 
four-year term on Tuesday. Directing his message specifically to the valley 
Democrats, Wilson appealed, "You are welcome in this party . . . (that) really 
represents your values." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also used Sunday's events to again campaign as the candidate of change, 
"the kind of change that affects every Californian. It affects the poor who are 
more often than not the victims of crime than those who are better off, and 
certainly those who are most in need of the freedom of a better education, 
those who need that kind of reform as a method of upward mobility. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to unite and lead all Californians into the 21st Century with the 
kind of change that you can't bring if you are obligated to the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
One of Wilson's oft-repeated messages is that Feinstein is so tied to the 
entrenched Democratic leadership in the state Legislature that she cannot carry 
out her promise to change California for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this tour, and the entire campaign for that matter, Wilson has 
talked like an outsider promising to make change. For example, he said Sunday 
that "We cannot afford mediocrity in education," making it sound as if he 
blamed the two-term incumbent Republican governor, George Deukmejian, for the 
ills that beset public education in California. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson said his ire is not aimed at Deukmejian, but at Democratic-aligned 
interests such as the California Teachers' Assn., which bitterly opposes 
Wilson's proposal for merit pay for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and other Republicans have focused special attention on the San Joaquin

<P>
Collier Vale was one of the most respected lawyers in the Monterey County 
district attorney's office, a driven prosecutor who won numerous high-profile 
convictions and was a prime candidate for a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
But after 10 years as a prosecutor, where he frequently worked 60 to 70 hours a 
week and slowly rose through the ranks in the office, Vale felt that a single 
case had ruined his reputation and destroyed his career. 
</P>
<P>
On a Thursday evening last month, after telling friends he was tired of 
defending himself against accusations that never seemed to end, Vale put a 
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The case that friends say led to Vale's suicide involved the death of a 
confidential informant in one of his murder investigations. He was unjustly 
blamed for the woman's death, his colleagues say, and he was haunted by the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
His ordeal highlights the pressures and responsibilities prosecutors face when 
dealing in the shadowy world of confidential informants. It is a world where 
prosecutors try to protect people who sometimes can't be protected, where blame 
is quickly assigned when the interests of witnesses and suspects suddenly 
collide. 
</P>
<P>
"Collier's case was a prosecutor's nightmare," said Ann Hill, a deputy district 
attorney who worked with Vale. "What makes it so frightening is something like 
this could happen to any of us, no matter how conscientious we are . . . and 
Collier was maybe the most conscientious of us all." 
</P>
<P>
Vale's informant was killed in a burst of automatic gunfire, after her identity 
was inadvertently revealed. Local press reports appeared to blame Vale for the 
mix-up, and the story eventually received national attention on the tabloid 
television show, "A Current Affair." Vale was extremely upset, friends said, 
when the controversy became a major issue in the June election campaign for 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
When the family of the murdered informant filed a wrongful death suit against 
the county and a local police department, Vale knew he would soon face a series 
of hostile depositions and possibly an embarrassing, highly publicized trial. 
</P>
<P>
Vale, 39, was a proud man, friends said, and he could no longer endure the 
indignity of being constantly blamed for a witness's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Collier saw this whole thing as a humiliation and a failure," said his 
girlfriend Melinda Young. Her eyes filled with tears and she slowly shook her 
head. "He just couldn't let it go." 
</P>
<P>
The confidential informant first contacted police in Seaside, a blue-collar 
suburb near Monterey, and told them she had information about a drug-related 
murder. After Seaside police interviewed the woman, Vale was brought in to talk 
to her and to prepare to prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later Vale and a Seaside police officer decided to check in with the 
informant. The police officer, according to court records, called the number, 
talked briefly to a woman and then Vale picked up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
But Vale discovered that a terrible mistake had been made. Through a mix-up in 
telephone numbers, the officer had called a woman named Sognia Petite Johnson, 
20, instead of Sonjii Yvette Johnson, 23, the informant. Both women lived in 
the same small city, both their names were pronounced "Sonya," and both 
recently had contact with the Seaside Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
While inadvertently talking to the wrong woman, Vale said enough for her to 
figure out that the other woman was an informant. To protect herself from drug 
dealers, according to court records, Sognia Petite Johnson spread the word on 
the streets that "the other Sonya was a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, in August, 1989, Sonjii Yvette Johnson was shot to death in 
the driveway of her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
Vale did not learn that the phone call had led to Johnson's death until about 
six months later, when a district attorney investigator uncovered new 
information in the case. Vale realized, friends said, that the tragic mix-up 
was not his fault. And, after interviewing the woman, Vale had repeatedly 
offered to place her in a witness protection program. Still, he was plagued by 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a prosecutor, you feel very responsible for your witnesses," Hill 
said. "If one gets killed, even if you know it's not your fault, you're going 
to search over and over again in your mind wondering: 'Is there anything else I 
could have done?' You wouldn't become a prosecutor if you had a casual attitude 
toward the protection of people." 
</P>
<P>
And Vale was more protective of his witnesses than most prosecutors. He never 
simply subpoenaed witnesses to compel them to testify, said Dist. Atty. Michael 
Bartram. He always attempted to contact them personally. If witnesses wanted 
protection, he handled the arrangements himself, rather than refer them to the 
police or the witness protection coordinator. In one murder case he was 
prosecuting, he kept a picture of the victim on his desk for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Vale never had the chance to prosecute Johnson's killer. Because of his 
involvement in the case, the district attorney was disqualified and the state 
attorney general took over the prosecution. A Seaside man, who had been accused 
of shooting Johnson so she couldn't testify against him in a drug- related 
killing, recently pleaded guilty to her murder. 
</P>
<P>
Vale eventually came to terms with the woman's death, friends said, but he 
could not escape the scrutiny of others. In the small, tight-knit legal 
community of Monterey County, the controversy was a frequent topic of 
conversation. And for months Vale was confronted with almost daily reminders of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
He felt the local press was laying all the blame on him, Bartram said. He was 
so disturbed that "A Current Affair" was featuring the case he invited Bartram 
to his house because he was afraid to watch the show alone. And as a result of 
the wrongful death suit, he was unable to defend himself because he was advised 
not to talk about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Vale was particularly disturbed that the woman's death was attributed to his 
carelessness. One of his strengths as a prosecutor, other attorneys said, was 
his meticulous preparation, his almost obsessive attention to detail. Every 
evening he made a neatly numbered list, written in fountain pen in a tight 
script, of the things he wanted to accomplish the next day. He typed up all his 
opening and closing statements and every question he planned to ask prospective 
jurors or witnesses. He even transcribed all his courtroom notes and stored 
them in a computer file. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after his death, a judge told Young, Vale's girlfriend, that a 
prosecutor "can't survive in this businesses if he doesn't have a thick skin 
and a short memory." Vale had neither. 
</P>
<P>
He was a perfectionist, a high-strung, self-critical man who was never 
satisfied, said Young, a court reporter. And these qualities, she said, 
contributed to his death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very sensitive and always expected the impossible of himself," Young 
said. "When someone like this is wrongly accused of imperfections over and over 
again . . . sometimes it's too much for them to handle." 
</P>
<P>
It bothered Vale that he was criticized for not contacting the informant and 
telling her they had mistakenly talked to another woman with a similar name. 
But Vale had no idea the call to the other woman would endanger the informant, 
colleagues said, and the decision to contact the informant was the 
responsibility of the police. In a recent deposition, Vale explained: "I 
informed the lead investigator of the situation and was left with the 
impression that there wasn't anything that needed to be done, that this was a 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
The day after Vale's death, the district attorney's office was traumatized. The 
prosecutors, veterans of countless criminal trials, were somewhat inured to 
tragedy. But Vale was one of the best-liked attorneys in the office, and his 
death hit them particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crying all that morning so I went to see one of our most hard-boiled 
prosecutors for some support," said Ann Hill. "But when he started talking 
about it, he burst into tears and was grabbing for the Kleenex. . . . So I 
walked over to our investigator's office. He's a former cop, a tough 
ex-sergeant. Mr. Stoneface. We started talking about Collier and then he starts 
crying. I mean really bawling. . . . The whole office was a mess that morning." 
</P>
<P>
Vale was widely admired, Hill said, because of his many talents. He was a fine 
artist, whose pen-and-ink drawings of Victorian houses and animals were so good 
many thought he should have a showing. He had a great sense of humor, 
colleagues said, and people often gathered in his office while he impersonated 
a Korean judge impersonating John Wayne or did impressions of opposing 
attorneys. He was a former college tennis player who could have made a living 
as a club pro. 
</P>
<P>
And he was a charismatic trial attorney who had won a number of big cases, 
including convictions against a county coroner who stole from estates and 
school district employees who embezzled public funds. His goal was to become a 
judge, and many thought he was an ideal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so much going for him, but after all that had happened, he was 
convinced he didn't have anything left," Young said. "His career was the most 
important thing in the world to him . . . it was his life." She briefly closed 
her eyes. "He thought his career was over." 
</P>
<P>
On Vale's last day of work, he wrote on his calender a list of 10 possible 
career options, including entering private practice, teaching tennis or going 
to another district attorney's office. Before walking out, he stopped by the 
office of Karen Rezai, a young deputy district attorney whose work he 
supervised. When Rezai passed the Bar, he had given her a pen-and-ink drawing 
of a Victorian house in Pacific Grove, one of his favorites. Vale spent several 
minutes staring at the picture before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
He took a long walk on the beach at dusk with his best friend, Greg Lehman, a 
tennis teacher, and then went to dinner with Young. Vale talked about leaving 
law and trying to get a job teaching tennis at a club. He was agitated about 
the case that night, Lehman said, but his concern "would come in waves of 
anxiety." One moment he would worry about the case; then he would calm down. At 
one point he said softly: "It's always there and it keeps coming up." 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, Vale returned home to his small cottage in Monterey, where he had 
lived alone since his divorce five years ago. He packed his car for a trip to 
Yosemite the next day and set his automatic coffee maker for early the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Vale never left a suicide note, but his friends and co-workers have little 
doubt that his death was the final legacy in a tragic case. 
</P>
<P>
"Collier probably had some brandy and smoked his pipe, which he liked to do at 
night," Lehman said. "He had a gun around for protection, because of some of 
the people he had prosecuted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been an impulsive act. The case was always roaming around in his 
brain and he probably got to the point that night where he was in a deep morass 
. . . like he was in this maze and he couldn't see any way out."

BAKER VISITS BAHRAIN OFFICIALS, RESTLESS GIS; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: 'WHEN ARE WE GOING HOME?' TROOPS ASK. THE SECRETARY DISCUSSES WAR 
OPTIONS WITH A ROYAL FAMILY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had a somewhat sobering encounter Sunday 
with about 4,200 restless and homesick American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, then 
held discussions about war options with aging members of Bahrain's royal 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Making his second visit in a little more than a month to U.S. forces along the 
Persian Gulf front, Baker was bombarded with dozens of repetitions of a single 
question: "When are we going to go home?" 
</P>
<P>
He also fielded criticism from the troops about poor food and water and 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up his impressions for a pool of reporters who accompanied him from 
Bahrain to the 1st Cavalry Division's encampment in eastern Saudi Arabia, Baker 
nevertheless said: "I was pleased to see that morale is good. . . . The main 
question is knowing what the future holds. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one thing that people are asking more than anything else, and of 
course that's something that, right now, can't be answered with a great deal of 
specificity." 
</P>
<P>
Baker made visiting the troops the first order of business at the start of a 
weeklong trip to seven nations in the Persian Gulf and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in khaki pants, a khaki safari-style shirt and worn cowboy boots, he 
climbed off his Air Force jetliner after a 15-hour flight from Washington and 
immediately boarded a helicopter for an hourlong ride to the 1st Cavalry's 
encampment west of Dhahran in the Saudi desert. Security regulations prohibit 
disclosure of the exact location. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the sacrifice that's involved in being here," Baker told the 
troops, who were assembled around a podium shaded by a camouflage net. "Let me 
say that we appreciate as well the sacrifice that your families are making in 
order for you to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long, long way from home, but I think that Americans are at home 
wherever our principles are." 
</P>
<P>
Mingling with the troops after his speech, Baker heard tightly controlled "Can 
do, sir" rhetoric from the division's officers, mixed with complaints about 
food, water and boredom from the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"Got everything you need out here?" Baker asked one officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, if we ain't got it, we're building it," the officer replied. 
</P>
<P>
But an enlisted woman demanded: "When are we going to get to go home?" 
</P>
<P>
"How long you been here?" Baker asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Too long," the woman replied. 
</P>
<P>
When another soldier said the division had been deployed for 30 days, Baker 
said, "Thirty days? Stay a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
After Baker had passed, Sgt. Lisa Jones, 29, Toledo, Ohio, told reporters: 
"Time is being wasted. Let's do something or go." 
</P>
<P>
Second Lt. Henry Wardick, 23, said, "I'd like to go home as soon as possible, 
but let's get the job done." He added: "Most of us assume we'll be going to war 
sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
However, the troops generally seemed pleased with the attention. One offered 
Baker a chew of tobacco, which he gnawed and spat for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I'd find any of that out here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other soldiers shouted that Baker should try the much-too-warm drinking water 
or the packaged MRE ("meals ready to eat," the military's equally unappetizing 
successor to the C-ration). 
</P>
<P>
A group of soldiers gave reporters a chicken ala king MRE, demanding that it be 
passed along to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to eat this for 30 days," a woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may come as somewhat of a surprise to some of you to know that I used to 
live on this stuff when I was in the Marine Corps, even though it was a little 
bit different then -- they were in cans -- but it wasn't a lot different," 
Baker said after receiving the package. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker told the troops that U.S. forces were dispatched to the gulf 
because America is determined not to repeat the "mistakes that were made in the 
1930s," his speech was devoid of the bellicose rhetoric that has marked his 
recent speeches, as well as President Bush's. 
</P>
<P>
Although the reference to the 1930s was clearly intended to compare Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein with Adolf Hitler, Baker did not use the Nazi 
dictator's name the way that Bush has done repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
The future for the 1st Cavalry and the rest of the international force in the 
gulf is what Baker came to the region to discuss. He has said he wants to find 
out what other members of the anti-Iraq coalition will do if the confrontation 
escalates to open combat. 
</P>
<P>
In Bahrain, the leaders of the island nation, which has served as home port for 
U.S. Navy warships since 1949, told Baker that they support U.S. moves so far 
and can be counted on for the long pull. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is a crisis, there is no limit to the cooperation between the 
United States and the states in this part of the world," said Tarik Moayyid, 
Bahrain's minister of information. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Bahrain, which has committed its tiny air force to the multinational 
force, will be ready for war if that becomes necessary, Moayyid said, "These 
armies from all over the world are not here for a picnic." 
</P>
<P>
Baker met separately with Bahrain's ailing emir, Sheik Isa ibn Salman al 
Khalifa, Foreign Minister Sheik Mohammed ibn Mubarak al Khalifa and Prime 
Minister Sheik Khalifa ibn Salman al Khalifa. The emir, recently hospitalized 
for exhaustion, received Baker in the hospital -- the first foreign visitor to 
see him there. 
</P>
<P>
Talking briefly to reporters, the Bahraini foreign minister said his tiny 
nation hopes to end the crisis peacefully but "if we don't succeed, we have 
other alternatives to look at." 
</P>
<P>
From Bahrain, Baker goes today to Taif, Saudi Arabia, where the exiled 
government of Kuwait is holed up in luxurious exile in a Sheraton hotel. Later 
in the day, he goes to Jidda to confer with King Fahd and other top Saudi 
officials.

DIRECT, CREDIBLE ATTACK ADS WORKING BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a season when Americans are fed up with politics and the direction of the 
country, candidates are finding that negative campaigning is working better 
than ever -- as long as it is an honest straight-in-the-face assault. 
</P>
<P>
Amid so much public cynicism, ads with positive messages and ads that are 
amusing or even attractive are proving ineffective. And the ads working best 
are those attack messages that have an air of being direct, simply photographed 
and offering some sense of credible documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the autumn of attack verite. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are simple, if discouraging. Voters are so distrustful of politics 
and the government that positive promises of hope and hard work strike them as 
unconvincing. At the same time, they are so wary of political commercials that 
anything particularly clever or handsome seems too slick and manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
"Our figures show 65% to 70% of the people feel the country is on the wrong 
track," said Neil Newhouse of the Wirthlin Group, former President Ronald 
Reagan's pollster. "In this kind of an environment, 'Morning in America' 
doesn't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
With limited patience for the political game, voters appear to want ads that 
make it easy to decide quickly between candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"When you test the really funny, clever, creative stuff, they aren't any good 
because people see them as advertising rather than down and dirty information," 
said Doc Sweitzer, a Democratic media consultant with nine clients in close 
races. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost as if voters have become so hardened by politics that negative 
messages seem more believable. As a result: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Voters are responding best when candidates show a lot of visual 
documentation to illustrate claims, particularly newspaper clippings and 
financial reports, as in the spots of California's gubernatorial hopefuls Pete 
Wilson and Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Photography has gotten simple, even crude, while music, fancy cutting and 
amusing manipulations of the image are out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And in what was once considered a particularly public form of political 
self-immolation, many candidates are delivering their attacks themselves, 
staring straight into the camera's unblinking eye, like Republican Sen. Larry 
Pressler of South Dakota and Democratic Senate challenger Harry Lonsdale in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
In some races, increasing scrutiny of political advertising by the press is 
also encouraging attack ads to be more authoritative and fact-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
Many attacks this year seem less personal than in previous campaigns and more 
oriented around themes such as the economy, the environment and local problems, 
while tying all of those to a sense of discontent with politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals are even finding that incumbents need to go on the 
attack earlier than ever before, or risk allowing their challenger to define 
them as part of the troubled status quo. 
</P>
<P>
That partly explains why mild mannered Democrat Paul Simon, so quick on the 
trigger in Illinois this year, is expected to hold his Senate seat. And it 
helps understand why Republican maverick Mark O. Hatfield, hesitant to attack 
in Oregon, may well lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be you went positive first, then negative later," said Democratic 
pollster Paul Maslin. "Now you go negative first, then battle it out back and 
forth and finish positive." 
</P>
<P>
The attack must also be tailored specifically to an opponent's position or 
record. One reason Republican Sen. Jesse Helms is in trouble in North Carolina, 
consultants from both parties said, is that he used the same rhetoric to attack 
Democrat Harvey Gantt he had used on opponents in earlier years, and now it 
smacked of politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
And if advertising is increasingly negative, the most effective strategy to 
combat it might be called a double negative. Once, denial was considered the 
best response to an attack, but now, many political consultants say, their 
research suggests the best approach is to attack the attacker for slinging mud. 
It seems that even though voters respond best to ads they think of as 
comparative and informational, in theory they still don't like the idea of 
attack politics. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign of Democratic Senate hopeful Paul Wellstone in Minnesota might 
seem to offer one exception to the notion that "clever" commercials don't work 
this year. Wellstone, a political science professor turned candidate, has 
produced some of the most sophisticated spots in years. 
</P>
<P>
His best known was a takeoff on the movie "Roger and Me" called "Where's Rudy?" 
that ran for an extraordinary two minutes. In it, Wellstone wanders into the 
campaign headquarters of rival Rudy Boschwitz, looking for the incumbent 
Republican senator and clearly putting Boschwitz's uncomfortable staff on the 
defensive. The spot, which dramatized Boschwitz's refusal to debate, implied in 
look and length that Wellstone was not a typical politician and suggested that 
Boschwitz was. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ad ran only twice in the state, and it was designed largely to 
attract media attention to Wellstone's financially starved campaign. It worked 
like a jump start, and Wellstone may well beat Boschwitz as part of a tide that 
is running against politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
But even this spot, while clever, was shot in a plain manner with a hand-held 
camera, more a home video than the highly stylized roving camera "realism" of 
recent Madison Avenue campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, all the insights of political consultants are part of a 
self-contained universe. Once polling and focus group tests show a message to 
be effective with voters in one place, the consultants naturally test the same 
message elsewhere. That does not mean that only that message would work, only 
that it has already been refined. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this year -- whether for Republicans or Democrats -- certain themes are 
hard to miss. 
</P>
<P>
The most widespread is portraying oneself as outside the system, and unfettered 
by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am seeing is not anti-incumbent but anti-politics," said Ed Goeas, 
president of Tarrance &amp; Associates, a Republican polling firm. Hence 
incumbents can survive, but "you have to make sure you come across as not just 
another politician." 
</P>
<P>
One way candidates are doing this is by trying longer commercials -- a minute, 
for instance, rather than 30 seconds, a tack tried by Republican gubernatorial 
candidate George V. Voinovich in Ohio and Republican Tommy G. Thompson in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, treating issues with more substance, or at least at greater length, 
has become a marketing advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Another attempt to create the impression that candidates are different is to 
have them on screen delivering their attacks personally. 
</P>
<P>
This turns on its head the conventional wisdom of political assault, which held 
that candidates should have unseen narrators deliver their attacks, while 
making the visual message look like news footage or perhaps draping it in 
humor. The closer a candidate got to one of his attacks, the thinking went, the 
greater the risk he might splatter mud on himself. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a decade of ever greater rancor, however, culminating in the 1988 
presidential election, consultants no longer believe that voters are fooled 
about who is doing the slinging. 
</P>
<P>
Now, doing the deed oneself adds credibility. "The candidate delivering the 
attack is more effective than the eerie black-and-white footage you used to 
expect to use," Goeas said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is everywhere, whether it's Sen. Pressler staring earnestly into 
the camera (dressed like everybody's neighbor in a flannel shirt) or Democrat 
Ted Muenster, answering Pressler back (Pressler's attack was actually a 
response to Muenster's initial assault). 
</P>
<P>
"This is the next logical stage of negative advertising," said Larry J. Sabato, 
professor of political science at the University of Virginia. "Candidates want 
their attacks to be credible because they know voters are hardened to them. It 
is like one-upmanship in negativism." 
</P>
<P>
Only four years ago, injecting humor in attack ads was considered a clever way 
of deflecting the potential backlash from making an attack. Consultants David 
Doak and Bob Shrum gained credit for helping Alan Cranston hold his Senate seat 
in California with an amusing spot fashioned in the style of an ad for a 
Greatest Hits Record Album, which highlighted Republican Ed Zschau's greatest 
flip-flops. 
</P>
<P>
This year there are cases where humor has backfired. 
</P>
<P>
One consultant privately described facing a particularly amusing attack ad in 
the South that initially had him worried. The spot highlighted how his 
candidate had taken a lot of free trips using state planes and automobiles. In 
the final seconds, the ad said all this was part of the reason the state had 
needed a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
When he tested the advertisement in focus groups, however, the consultant found 
the ad was ineffective. Audiences saw it as amusing entertainment and either 
missed or didn't take seriously the link to a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic pollster Maslin said also that portraying oneself as a political 
outsider has worked best when candidates have linked that message to local 
issues, particularly economic ones. 
</P>
<P>
In Montana, for instance, Democratic Sen. Max Baucus was a key sponsor of the 
Clean Air Act, one of the most significant environmental laws passed in years. 
But in his ad back home on the issue, his media consultant Jim Margolis 
explained: "Much of the focus of the spot is that it means 1,500 new clean coal 
jobs in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
In California, one Democratic consultant said privately, one problem Feinstein 
has faced is that she assumed her personality and femininity made her an 
outsider, and she failed to link that to other issues to make it a larger 
theme. As the battle with Wilson fell into a traditional pattern of attack and 
counterattack over their respective records, her special status as an outsider 
was lost in the fray.

<P>
BALLOTING: MEMORIES ARE VIVID OF THE GOOF-UPS AND MISMANAGEMENT OF JUNE'S 
PRIMARY IN AMADOR COUNTY. MANY ARE BRACING FOR BLUNDERS AT THE POLLS TUESDAY. 
</P>

JACKSON, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in tiny Amador County, 40 crooked miles southeast of Sacramento, have 
their fingers crossed, hoping the flurry of mistakes that spoiled last June's 
primary election won't be repeated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although this Gold Rush county, with only 30,000 residents and about 17,000 
registered voters, is one of the smallest in the state, it is often one of the 
last to report election returns, according to the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the first Amador report was phoned into the secretary of state at 4:59 
a.m. -- nine hours after the polls closed. But many people think the election 
was mishandled so badly that it might have been better if no returns had been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Among the blunders were these: 
</P>
<P>
* County Clerk-Recorder Sheldon D. Johnson personally assembled ballot holders 
incorrectly in four of the county's 28 precincts, invalidating more than 650 
ballots and throwing the race for sheriff into the courts. 
</P>
<P>
* Sample ballots were not mailed until one week before the June 5 election, 
which meant that most absentee voters never saw sample ballots. 
</P>
<P>
* The count was late because pre-punched cards used in Amador County's 
Votamatic system were punched incorrectly and had to be redone before counting 
could begin, technician Don Baumer said. 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson and his staff counted absentee ballots that arrived after the polls 
closed, a clear violation of the state election code. 
</P>
<P>
* In a special fire district election, people who were not supposed to vote did 
so and vice versa, partly because poorly trained precinct workers did not know 
who was eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
* Several people said security was lax in the vote-counting area on election 
night and that "known campaign workers" mingled with the official vote 
tabulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Nineteen years in the newspaper business and I haven't come across anything 
like this," said Tom Mauldin, managing editor of the thrice-weekly Amador 
Ledger Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents said things haven't been as exciting in this historic Mother 
Lode area since Jackson's notorious house of prostitution was shut down in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"People were livid," said Virginia LaVielle, who managed the campaign of Ken 
Blake, the "losing" candidate for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
After the election, angry residents formed Concerned Citizens for an Accurate 
Election to try to pressure Johnson, the County Board of Supervisors and the 
secretary of state into making sure that June's errors are not repeated in 
Tuesday's General Election. 
</P>
<P>
But the early signs do not look good. 
</P>
<P>
Absentee ballots and sample ballots were mailed late again, although not as 
late as last spring. Some voters have complained that the sample ballots do not 
adequately explain the complicated statewide measures to be voted on. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that the names of candidates appear on the ballot in 
one supervisorial district where there is no contest but do not appear in a 
second district where there is a race. 
</P>
<P>
And, most daunting of all to many voters, Johnson has announced that he will 
dispense with the services of an outside technician and handle the computerized 
vote-counting equipment himself on election night. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done it before, I'm sure it will be all right," he said. "The only reason 
I didn't do it in June was that I was a candidate myself." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism for the June snafu's has been directed at the 50-year-old 
Johnson, who has been County Clerk-Recorder since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an honest and credible man, but he is incompetent," LaVielle said. That 
opinion was expressed in many other interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson blinked a time or two when these criticisms were recited during an 
interview but didn't appear to be greatly disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
The county clerk concedes that he made mistakes in June, especially in 
assembling ballot holders so that votes were recorded for the wrong candidates. 
He also takes general responsibility for the foul-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"It ends with me," Johnson said. "I'm in charge of elections, I'm responsible." 
</P>
<P>
But he placed some of the blame on Western Elections, a Stockton printing 
company that delivered sample ballots so late that they could not be mailed out 
before May 29, one week before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Caren Daniels-Meade, chief of elections in the secretary of state's office, 
said Western Elections was late in delivering materials to seven counties but 
that serious voting problems have come to light only in Amador County. 
</P>
<P>
Jake Harvey, president of Western Elections, said: "My election manager 
resigned at a critical time" on May 21, but that Johnson had assured him in a 
telephone conversation that the delay would not cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
"His problem is himself, if you ask me," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson conceded that some absentee ballots were counted even though they 
arrived after the polls closed, in violation of the state election code. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were a few," he said. "Everything was so late -- we were trying 
to give everybody a chance to vote. I know you're not supposed to do that but 
we thought it was being fair." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Halvorson who runs Jackson's only automobile agency, worries that all the 
problems will give voters a reason to stay away from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had a pretty high turnout in this county, but this kind of thing 
just builds voter apathy," he said. "When people think their vote doesn't 
count, then where are we at? That's what bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
So Amador County voters will approach the polls Tuesday with some trepidation, 
wondering whether the general election will go smoothly or if they will have an 
opportunity once again to display bumper stickers that read, "Amador County -- 
Famous for Wine, Gold and Recounts."

STATE ISSUES RANGE FROM GROWTH TO GAY 'MARRIAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland will select a new mayor, San Francisco will again decide whether to 
recognize gay couples as symbolically married and Inyo County will vote on the 
political fate of its Board of Supervisors in some of Tuesday's less glamorous 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Around California, growth measures and traffic controls also are on the ballot 
in several locales. And in Yucaipa, near San Bernardino, two school board 
members face recall in a dispute over whether a set of reading books encourages 
Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's mayoral candidates are both 43-year-old black leaders and liberal 
Democrats -- state Assemblyman Elihu Harris and City Councilman Wilson Riles 
Jr., son of the former state schools chief. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has campaigned against redevelopment plans for the city's Jack London 
Square and a downtown shopping complex, while Riles most recently led the 
effort that stymied a costly plan to lure the Los Angeles Raiders football team 
back to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the campaign Riles voluntarily took a drug test -- it came back 
negative -- and attacked Harris for refusing a test. Harris, who had advocated 
drug tests for arrested juveniles, said the test was not necessary because he 
does not use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a state legislator since 1978, has raised more than twice as much money 
as Riles and appears to be the front-runner to replace Lionel Wilson, an 
architect of the fateful Raiders deal who lost the mayor's office in the June 
primary after three terms. Wilson, who once considered Harris a political 
protege, has endorsed Riles, formerly the mayor's political nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the question of offering legal standing to gay couples who 
choose to register at City Hall is again on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "domestic parters" law was rejected in past elections, but this 
time the measure provides none of the official benefits of marriage. Rather, it 
is regarded as a symbolic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
Still it has been controversial, matching the moral sway of Roman Catholic 
church leaders against the city's liberal political leanings. 
</P>
<P>
Growth along the waterfront also is an issue in San Francisco. One measure on 
Tuesday's ballot would encourage the large Mission Bay development in China 
Basin by waiving the city's stringent growth controls. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure would suspend waterfront development in San Francisco to allow 
more thorough planning. 
</P>
<P>
On the east side of the Sierra Nevada, three members of the Inyo County Board 
of Supervisors face a recall driven by resentment of a water deal they 
negotiated with the city of Los Angeles. A fourth incumbent supervisor also is 
seeking reelection on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Defeat of the incumbents would scotch the water deal with Los Angeles and could 
lead to new legal challenges to the city's century-old practice of gathering 
water in Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In Yucaipa, a community of suburbs and horse ranches against the hills east of 
San Bernardino, two school board members face recall for approving a set of 
reading books called "Impressions" that some parents say is anti-Christian and 
unsuitable for children. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative classes have been offered to children whose parents object to the 
books, but the issue has remained divisive, as it has in other small towns 
around the West. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig went to Yucaipa last week to lend 
moral support to the school board and was jeered by parents, some of whom 
called him a "Satanist." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, the most divisive Orange County measure would 
raise the sales tax by a half-cent to pay for projects that, at least in 
theory, would ease traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, voters are confronted with two confusing growth-control 
measures. They were placed on the ballot in a miscalculation by the 
construction industry, and many developers now oppose the measures. 
</P>
<P>
Developers feared that more stringent laws would be offered by slow-growth 
advocates and tried to beat them to the ballot with more moderate plans. But 
the stricter controls never materialized, and now the propositions -- measures 
D and M -- have no active supporters. 
</P>
<P>
They are opposed both by some builders -- who say they will cost too much -- 
and slow-growth groups that call them "backward steps." 
</P>
<P>
The office of San Diego County sheriff also is up for grabs because John Duffy, 
who held it for 20 years, decided not to run after several years of controversy 
about jail overcrowding and a security system at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Goleta north of Santa Barbara and three towns in Riverside County -- Canyon 
Lake, Murrieta and Calimesa -- will decide whether to incorporate as cities. 
</P>
<P>
Around Northern California, Marin and Sonoma counties will vote Tuesday on 
whether to raise the sales tax to pay for measures to ease rush-hour traffic. 
Most of the money would be for freeway improvements -- such as car pool lanes 
-- but a sizable chunk also would go toward a light-rail line that could cross 
the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Marin and Sonoma pulled out of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in the 
1960s, and thus do not enjoy the rail service that links many suburbs there 
with downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The question of urban growth in the nearby Napa Valley wine region also will be 
considered. Measure J in Napa County would require a public vote before any 
more vineyards or farm land could be rezoned to allow the construction of homes 
and stores. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bay Area the fate of the San Francisco Giants will be decided by a set 
of complex ballot measures in five cities. The Giants want a stadium built in 
Santa Clara, but the five cities first must approve a utility tax and a measure 
that would provide 98 acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the north, Sacramento County will vote on an advisory measure that 
asks if the County Board of Supervisors should push for building the large 
Auburn Dam on the American River. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sierra foothills, Tuolumne County voters will decide whether to slap 
controls on growth of the Jamestown gold mine, which uses cyanide to extract 
the ore.

Moldova's president appealed Sunday for an end to street demonstrations and 
urged his Parliament to reconsider laws that have stirred ethnic unrest and 
violence in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
The speech by President Mirca I. Snegur marked the first time that the ethnic 
Moldovan leadership has accepted blame for separatist movements in the 
Turkish-Christian Gagauz region of southern Moldova and in the predominantly 
Russian and Ukrainian Dniester area in the east, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
It came one day after a meeting in Moscow with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
in which Snegur and representatives of the separatist groups agreed to a 
moratorium on acts that led to the ethnic crisis in the small Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the moratorium have not been worked out. Lawmakers said it probably 
would mean the Gagauz and Dniester regions would suspend their recent 
declarations of sovereignty and planned elections. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the republic's government would soften a language law that made 
Moldovan the national language and required people in dozens of jobs, ranging 
from doctors to hairdressers, to pass tests in the language by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The law has stirred resentment among Russian speakers and Gagauz residents, who 
speak a Turkic language. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not giving up our national rebirth, our language, alphabet, symbols and 
so on," Snegur told lawmakers Sunday. "Simply, we must go back and look for 
where, maybe, we have gone too fast for our fellow citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The Moldova republic, formerly called Moldavia, was carved from territory 
seized from Romania in 1940. The republic declared independence of Moscow in 
July. The Turkic Gagauz minority declared a separate republic in August, and 
the Dniester population declared a breakaway in September, claiming 
discrimination by the Moldovan, or ethnic Romanian, majority. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, thousands of demonstrators on Sunday demanded reunification with 
their ethnic kin in Moldova. About 2,000 Romanians marched to the Soviet 
Embassy in Bucharest, shouting "We want Bessarabia back!" Bessarabia is another 
name for Moldova. About 4,000 Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu 
voiced similar demands. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who attended the meeting between 
Snegur and Gorbachev, went on Soviet television Saturday night to warn that 
Moscow would take tough measures if Moldova did not restore order.

HIS ECONOMISTS ASSAIL GORBACHEV'S INDECISION; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: KEY ADVISERS SAY THE SOVIET ECONOMY WILL GET WORSE BECAUSE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S INCONSISTENT POLICIES.

<P>
Top economic advisers to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused him of 
indecisiveness and inconsistency Sunday and said the Soviet economy will get 
even worse as a result of his policies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 leading economists who published their views in the newspaper 
Komsomolskaya Pravda was Stanislav S. Shatalin, a member of Gorbachev's 
Presidential Council and the author of the "500-Day Plan" for rapid economic 
reform that Gorbachev and Soviet lawmakers recently rejected. 
</P>
<P>
It was Shatalin's first major public statement since his plan was voted down in 
favor of a more gradual transition from communism to a market system. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 warned that the Soviet Union is headed toward hyper-inflation and a 
painful transition. 
</P>
<P>
"The inflation spiral will spin faster and faster, the collapse of the consumer 
market will increase, the economy will be further and further from a condition 
of equilibrium," the economists said. "This will be the price we will pay for 
indecisiveness and inconsistency in choosing our path in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation continues to worsen," they wrote. "The planned stabilizing 
measures have already become insufficient. People are losing faith both in the 
reform and in the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
After supporting Shatalin's plan in September, Gorbachev backpedaled and 
proposed milder guidelines for economic change, fearing that the more radical 
measures would work too great a hardship on the country's 290 million people. 
The Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, adopted this approach last month. 
</P>
<P>
But the 12 economists, who included Gorbachev's own economics adviser, Nikolai 
Y. Petrakov, said that the milder measures, which had been proposed by Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, cannot rescue the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the essential weaknesses of the Gorbachev plan, the economists asserted, 
is its failure to quickly prop up the ruble, the Soviet currency, which is not 
freely convertible to foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The "500-Day Plan," which called for stabilization of the economy by 
introducing the market forces of supply and demand, would have made recovery of 
the financial system the priority. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition to market relations now will take place not through 
stabilization of the ruble," the economists said, "but through inflation and 
belated measures aimed at overcoming inflation, which will turn out to be quite 
painful." 
</P>
<P>
The article warned people not to be fooled by the fact that the phraseology in 
Gorbachev's guidelines is similar to the phraseology of the "500-Day Plan." 
</P>
<P>
The economists also predicted that the current economic reforms could lead to 
hyper-inflation if retail prices are increased and those with low incomes 
receive compensation through higher pay, pensions or welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation is predicted to run at 18%, the government newspaper Izvestia 
reported Sunday, and in the private sector prices are already rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in the farmers' markets, where many people buy much of their food, were 
18% higher in the first half of 1990 than during the same period last year. In 
July, they increased by 29%, in August by 30% and in September by 34%. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the inflation, the newspaper said, is that the government 
keeps increasing its production of rubles, creating a situation in which too 
many rubles are chasing too few goods. In the first nine months of 1990, 
Izvestia reported, 1.7 times as much money was issued than in the same time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
In their article, the economists also criticized as misleading the adoption 
last week by the Russian Federation's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, of a 
500-day program for transition to a market-based system. 
</P>
<P>
"The press took the statement by (Russian Prime Minister Ivan S.) Silayev for 
real and announced the beginning of a 500-day plan," the economists said.

Three French military personnel captured recently near the Saudi-Iraqi border 
while on a scouting mission arrived in Paris early Sunday after Iraq handed 
them over to the French Embassy in Baghdad, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The three, a captain and two noncommissioned officers, were in a jeep on a 
reconnaissance patrol when they bumped into Iraqi troops. No shots were fired, 
the French army said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear yet if they will face charges and punishment for allowing 
themselves to be captured," a French diplomat in the Middle East said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, a week ago, embarrassed Paris when Iraq revealed it Friday and 
then said it was freeing them in appreciation of a special relationship with 
France.

NO 2ND FRONT AGAINST IRAQ, TURKEY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: PRESIDENT OZAL CALLS THE IDEA 'FANTASY' THAT TURKEY WOULD ATTACK FROM 
THE NORTH TO ASSIST U.S. TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH.

<P>
President Turgut Ozal said he has ruled out the idea of a Turkish "second 
front" against northern Iraq that might relieve U.S. and allied forces if they 
attack on the south to free Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"This second-front question is pure fantasy," Ozal told reporters over the 
weekend in a statement that Turkey's state radio and television underlined by 
making it their lead news item. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader, one of the strongest pillars of the alliance against 
Baghdad, staked out his position ahead of scheduled talks Wednesday with 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is on a seven-nation tour of U.S. 
allies to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But Ozal did not rule out future Turkish military involvement, merely saying 
that "no such proposition has been received" and adding that, in his view, the 
Iraqi army is a much overrated force. 
</P>
<P>
The official position of Turkey has been that it will participate in military 
action against Iraq only if the action is specifically authorized by the U.N. 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Turkey's strictly maintained economic embargo against its neighbor has 
been a major asset to the anti-Iraq alliance, so Turkey's 750,000-member armed 
forces, NATO's biggest in Europe, could play a vital role. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Turkish soldiers are currently reported in the Iraqi border area. 
Nearly all are defensively deployed, facing a similar number of Iraqi troops. 
But European diplomats say Washington would like Turkey to do more. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have already given Baker private assurances that in the event 
of war, they will look positively at requests to use their nation's big North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization air bases near the Iraqi border, Western diplomats 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But Ozal's statement implying that Turkey would not join a ground offensive put 
him back in the mainstream of Turkey's military-bureaucratic Establishment, 
which had been growing worried about the way he has been single-handedly 
negotiating Turkey's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Bozer quit last month in a move widely viewed as 
reflecting his ministry's distress at being sidelined in handling the gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And the Turkish military, still a major political force in Turkey, has no 
intention of joining any extra-territorial adventures and is not even trained 
to undertake major offensives, according to Necdet Oztorun, the former army 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
"The few things that most Turks agree on is that Turkey should not get further 
involved," said Sami Kohen, foreign affairs commentator with the liberal daily 
Milliyet. "But I don't rule out the possibility that in all these talks, he 
(Ozal) might accept some kind of a Turkish commitment."

LIBYA EXPELS RADICALS, SHUTS 4 TRAINING CAMPS, ABBAS SAYS

Abul Abbas, the mastermind of the Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking five 
years ago, said Sunday that Libya has expelled 145 members of his radical group 
and closed down four training camps. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas said the move was a surprise to him and his wing of the Palestine 
Liberation Front, considered to be a major terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ejection was unjustified and urged Libya's leader, Col. Moammar 
Kadafi, to reopen the camps and the group's offices. 
</P>
<P>
The government in Tripoli has not given an explanation for its action, he said. 
Reports began to surface about a week ago that Libya had expelled the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomats in Baghdad said the United States had asked King Hassan II of 
Morocco and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to press Kadafi to eject the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi is believed to want Libya's removal from the U.S. State Department's 
list of countries supporting terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
PLO chief Yasser Arafat has also been pressed to dissociate himself from Abbas, 
who has a seat on the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. Pressure to remove Abbas increased after his group raided an 
Israeli beach in May, an action that led to a break in a U.S.-PLO dialogue. 
Abbas said Arafat had not known about the raid in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Baghdad since leaving Lebanon in 1982, Abbas is believed to have 
several hundred guerrilla fighters in his organization -- in Iraq, Lebanon and, 
until now, Libya. 
</P>
<P>
A court in Genoa, Italy, in 1986 convicted Abbas in absentia for masterminding 
the Achille Lauro hijacking in which an American was killed.

Two enemy aircraft entered its airspace from Saudi Arabia on Saturday morning, 
Iraq charged Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi news agency INA quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as 
saying the two planes flew three miles inside Iraqi airspace before turning 
back. It did not say whether they were fired at or intercepted by Iraqi jets. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Persian Gulf crisis began with Iraq's capture of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 
Baghdad has reported several violations of its airspace by aircraft believed to 
belong to the U.S.-led forces deployed in the gulf to defend Saudi Arabia and 
other gulf Arab states.

SPACE TELESCOPE STUDY TO YIELD NEW DATA ON QUASAR MYSTERIES

The Hubble Space Telescope has made its first observation of the chemical 
makeup of a distant quasar that may yield clues to the makeup of the early 
universe, NASA officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Using the telescope's Faint Object Spectrograph, astronomers from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and 
UC San Diego observed the spectrum of a faint quasar, called UM675, about 12 
billion light years from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
(A light year is the distance light travels in one year, or about 186,000 
miles.) 
</P>
<P>
Quasars, the brightest objects in the universe, emit energy that seems too 
intense to come from a source so compact. Although quasars were discovered in 
1963, scientists still understand little about them. 
</P>
<P>
E. Margaret Burbidge, the UC San Diego astronomer who led the team, said that 
one purpose of the eight-hour observation was to look for the "signature" of 
helium in the far ultraviolet spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of that helium signature, after analysis, should reveal something 
about how much helium existed in the early universe, Burbidge said. 
</P>
<P>
Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, but scientists say 
that not all of it could have come from the stars' nuclear fusion, which 
transforms hydrogen to helium. So it has been theorized that most of the helium 
came from the "big bang" explosion that some astronomers think created the 
universe about 15 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The part of a quasar's radiation that includes the main spectral lines produced 
by helium cannot be picked up by a ground-based telescope because it is blocked 
by Earth's ozone layer.

<TEXT>
<P>
A small amount of cocaine was found here in a hangar where space shuttles are 
readied for launch, NASA officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Space agency spokesman Karl Kristofferson said the drug was found early Friday 
in an orbiter processing facility, one of two at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time cocaine has been found at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, marijuana plants were discovered growing in isolated areas of the 
Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge where the space center is located, but the case 
did not involve NASA personnel. 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said the cocaine was found under a desk that is used 
by more than one person. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very small amount," Harris said. "Security doesn't want to talk about 
any details until they do more of their investigation." 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone told the Florida Today newspaper Saturday that the 
drug seizure "is considered an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
Malone said she did not know how much cocaine was involved. Officials said they 
did not yet know who owned the drug, and no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is led by security officers from NASA, Lockheed Space 
Operations Co. and EG&amp;G Florida Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is responsible for overall shuttle processing at the Kennedy Space 
Center under a multibillion-dollar contract, while EG&amp;G is responsible for 
base operations, including security. 
</P>
<P>
Malone initially said the cocaine was discovered by drug-sniffing dogs during a 
routine sweep, but Harris said no dogs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The security people don't want to say how it was found," Harris said.

A leading adviser to the late Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser said in an 
interview published Sunday that he believes that war in the Persian Gulf has 
already begun even though no shots have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Hassanein Heikal also said that the United States has delayed a 
military strike against Iraq because it is still learning how to operate its 
sophisticated military equipment in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we look at the realities on the ground, we can see clearly that the war has 
already begun," Heikal told the weekly Cairo magazine October. "There is 
already political mobilization, an economic blockade and the deployment of 
U.S.-led troops in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Heikal's late boss Nasser sent Egyptian troops to Yemen in the 1960s to support 
anti-Western forces, and Iraqi newspapers have compared Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein to the Egyptian nationalist leader. 
</P>
<P>
Heikal, former chief editor of the semiofficial Cairo daily Al Ahram and 
considered one of the brightest journalists in the Arab world, said he does not 
believe a lack of adequate ground forces is delaying a U.S. attack on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Americans are waiting not because of the United Nations or 
through lack of enough troops, but because they lack a clear picture of the 
nature of (military) operations in the Saudi desert, and they are also unsure 
about their political, social and strategic bases in the Arab world once 
operations begin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has deployed more than 200,000 troops in the gulf as part of 
an international force to confront Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of armed force needs a solid political base, both socially and 
economically," he said.

1,000 TAKE A WALK TO RAISE MONEY FOR AIDS SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 people raised $205,000 for AIDS service providers by walking 
downtown Los Angeles streets Sunday in the new "Eastside AIDS-Thon," designed 
to highlight the rising incidence of the deadly disease among blacks, Latinos, 
Asians and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout did not meet the expectations of organizers, whose goal was 5,000 
participants bringing in $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
But "it's the first year. We're very pleased," said Keith Malone of the AIDS 
Healthcare Foundation, which financed the event. "There will be a second one." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 agencies involved with acquired immune deficiency syndrome worked 
together on the walk-a-thon, conceived in part to break what they consider a 
monopoly on fund raising by the more famous AIDS Project Los Angeles "AIDS 
Walk." Proceeds in this year's AIDS Walk were $2.3 million.

SUCCESS CAME LATE TO LEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a nice thing that Jim Leyland was voted National League Manager of the 
Year. He paid a lot of dues for a lot of years and justice isn't always so 
poetic. 
</P>
<P>
He won the East Division championship with the Pirates, which put him in the 
company of the elite for the first time in his life. His humanity was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
He told of the 1962 Studebaker and of seasons living in the manager's office at 
the ballpark, and of the 82-year-old man the team bus would take to the 
ballpark every day. There is a volume of those stories that Leyland stored away 
in all those years in the minor leagues. They define him. 
</P>
<P>
He worked all of those years in the minor leagues -- as low as they get -- 
beginning in 1964, and he doesn't brush those years away. "A lot of times my 
brother Tom would lend me money so I could get through the season," Leyland 
recalled. "And he's a priest." 
</P>
<P>
In one early offseason Leyland was working in a glass factory near home at 
Perrysburg, Ohio, and bought a used 1962 Studebaker Lark. Green, with paint 
that was turning chalky. If you once saw one of those, you'd never forget it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really ugly," Leyland said. "Bad. I can remember driving it around and 
my dad sitting on the glider on the porch. I'd come home and he'd ask why I was 
sweaty. 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving around town with the windows up so people would think I had 
air-conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Some seasons later, he went from $400 a month playing to $6,000 for the 1971 
season to be a manager for the first time. "I bought a new Bonneville," Leyland 
said. "It was beautiful. But it would sit in the driveway because I couldn't 
pay for the gas." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Piniella is a nice fellow and he earned the success he had managing the 
Cincinnati Reds, but he's had success for a long time. A fruitful playing 
career changes a lot of life. The great revelations are an Earl Weaver, who 
never played in the big leagues but treasured a childhood foul ball collected 
from the bat of Johnny Hopp; a Sparky Anderson, who played one marginal season 
in the big leagues and recalled, in the time of his first winner as manager, 
how he had set the one-week record for dinette sets assembled at the plant in 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
And Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have Triple-A experience," he said during the National League 
playoffs. "I was a Double-A backup catcher, f'chrisakes. This is a pretty big 
thrill. I'm loving it. I worked real hard, but there are a lot of good baseball 
guys who aren't getting a pension who were as sharp as me. This is for them." 
</P>
<P>
He went off from Perrysburg in 1964 as a hometown hero to play in the Detroit 
Tigers' system and was told by Hoot Evers that first spring, Leyland said, "I 
might have to be a manager." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't hit enough to be any kind of a player, but the Tigers thought enough 
of him to keep him around, and Leyland wouldn't quit. He recalled that he'd 
have come home and gone to college, tried to become a high school coach, but he 
loved to make it as a player. "I was the happiest SOB in the minors," he said. 
"Sometimes I'd end up the season with a dollar in my pocket. How much do you 
need?" 
</P>
<P>
He was 27 years old when Frank Carswell, the manager of Bristol in the 
Appalachian League took sick and the job was offered. Leyland knew it wasn't 
going to sidetrack his slim big-league possibilities as a player. It made him a 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
As little as Leyland was making, he got by. Sometimes he rented an apartment, 
sometimes he'd live with a family in town and sometimes the best place was 
living in the clubhouse. "I don't say I lived in all the clubhouses," he said. 
"Sparky had this carpeted office in Lakeland that was really nice." 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Iowa, part of Quad Cities -- a rookie league -- was more like it. "I 
had 42 kids and no coach to help," Leyland said. "I'm also general manager for 
handing out meal money and making bus and motel arrangements. I got stuck doing 
all that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get up, go to the bank and go to the park at 8:30 to have a workout for 19 
kids at 9. At 3:30 in the afternoon I'd have another group. And then again at 
5:30 for the kids who were playing in the game. After the game I'd have to 
write a report on each of them. I didn't have a coach. That's why I can't throw 
too good any more after throwing two hours a day for all those years." 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Iowa, was one of those Norman Rockwell baseball towns where the ladies 
baked pies for the players. And Earl Fenn was 82 years old. The players called 
him "The Growler." Each day at 3 in the afternoon the bus would pick him up in 
front of his porch on the way to the park, and drop him off after the game. 
"I'd put him in the first seat," Leyland said. "I got him in the Medicare 
section at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him when I went to the mound, if he wanted me to take the pitcher out, 
light a match. He did." 
</P>
<P>
The year they won the division championship players poured champagne over The 
Growler's head. The next day The Growler took his eyeglass case out of his 
pocket and champagne ran out. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Tony La Russa took Leyland with him to be third base coach with the 
Chicago White Sox. "Hoot Evers made me a manager; La Russa made me a big-league 
manager," Leyland said. La Russa would bring Leyland into the office after the 
games to see and hear the questions the press asked. 
</P>
<P>
Leyland says he paid back the money he borrowed from his brother Tom. 
</P>
<P>
During that time with the White Sox, Earl Fenn, The Growler, died. Leyland 
drove the four hours each way to go to the funeral. "He was great," Leyland 
said. "Those are relationships you don't have up here." 
</P>
<P>
A man shouldn't have too much too soon.

TETTLETON AND ORIOLES MAY PART COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the fiscally responsible Baltimore Orioles intended to re-sign catcher 
Mickey Tettleton, their catcher-turned-free agent, they probably would have 
already completed the deal because -- and this is a dead give-away -- signing 
him now would almost certainly cost them more than it would have yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, all teams are eligible to negotiate with free agents, and there are 
perhaps a half a dozen teams, maybe twice that, interested in talking to 
Tettleton, a switch-hitting, power-hitting catcher. He's a commodity, as the 
market will clearly indicate, even if the Orioles aren't buying. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I can't say for certain the Orioles are not interested, because Orioles 
management, believing fervently in the public's right not to know, has said 
only that it won't negotiate in the media. But from what I can tell, the 
Orioles haven't done that much negotiating outside the media either. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the Orioles have offered a one-year contract. Yeah, I'm 
serious. Why would Tettleton, at 30 years of age, settle for a one-year deal 
when someone is going to offer him three years for a total of at least $5 
million, maybe $6 million, maybe $7 million, maybe more? 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles couldn't help but notice what the Philadelphia Phillies paid last 
week to keep free-agent catcher Darren Daulton, whose best season, which he 
just completed, was only marginally better than Tettleton's season of horrors, 
which he just completed. The Phillies, saying you have to hang on to your own 
players, gave Daulton $6.75 million over three years. Yes, that's more than Cal 
Ripken Jr. makes. Yes, that's what the market requires. When Daulton signed his 
contract, that may have been the beginning of the end of Tettleton as an 
Oriole. 
</P>
<P>
All Daulton has ever done is have one pretty good second half last season, 
although not nearly as impressive as the second half Washington Redskins 
quarterback Jeff Rutledge turned in Sunday. Tettleton has a track record. He 
has hit as many as 26 homers in a season. Even when he was striking out 160 
times last season, he hit 15 home runs, third on the club, to go with 51 RBI. 
Daulton, who was a .208 lifetime hitter before hitting .268 last season, had 12 
home runs and 57 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
In my view, Tettleton suffered through as bad a year as it is possible for him 
to have. By the way, Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson holds the same view. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton wants to stay with the Orioles, who are not only his first choice, 
but also his first through fifth choices. He found himself here. He became an 
All-Star here. He loves it here. But the Orioles, or at least those who sign 
the checks, have fallen out of love with him. Maybe it's just the strikeouts. 
More likely, it's the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
If Tettleton leaves, the Orioles would have Bob Melvin, a fine backup, and 
Chris Hoiles, a basically untested rookie, to fill his spot. That is clearly 
not enough. It isn't that Tettleton is a great player so much as it is that he 
is the best catcher they have. If someone else is willing to pay him the money, 
why aren't the Orioles? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't too late, but, if you believe as I do, there is no reason to be 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Orioles have failed to pick up an option on Joe Price, a veteran 
left-handed reliever who would have made $400,000. They said that he has a bad 
back that may go out at any time. I'm sure that's true. I'm pretty sure, too, 
that if Price made $120,000, or whatever the minimum is today, that he'd be 
back. The funny thing is that on almost any other club, a $400,000 player is 
considered a bargain. But not on the Orioles, who, as we all know and as we can 
surely recite together, have the lowest payroll in the majors. Which keeps 
getting lower. 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder about those who believe the Orioles should let 
Tettleton go, saying that he's not worth the money. Well, who is? Was Buster 
Douglas worth $24 million? It comes down to this: Who would you rather see with 
the money, owner Eli Jacobs or player Mickey Tettleton? 
</P>
<P>
The fans wouldn't pay for Tettleton, except very indirectly. Baltimore Ticket 
prices are not going up next season, regardless of the size of the payroll. And 
they will go up, perhaps considerably, in 1992, when the new stadium opens, 
again regardless of the size of the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, after drawing 4.9 million fans over the last two seasons, have the 
money. I think they should use it to sign George Bell or Ted Higuera or both. I 
don't know if either wants to come here. I know Tettleton wants to stay, 
though. And I know the Orioles, unless they make some impressive off-season 
moves, would be not be as good without him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Orioles might sign Tettleton Monday and surprise us all. Or 
maybe they'll do the right thing, allowing Tettleton to see what he is worth on 
the open market and then assessing what he would take to stay as an Oriole. 
It's possible. And it's also possible that Froot Loops really do help you hit 
home runs.

INTERNS' RX FOR BETTER CARE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: LONG SHIFTS AND WORKWEEKS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL, RESIDENTS SAY. 
THEY'RE AFFILIATING WITH UNIONS IN HOPES OF GAINING BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS.

By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before she became a doctor, Dr. Susan Londerville worked as a secretary -- in 
union and non-union shops. "The difference was like night and day," she said 
recently. When she searched for a residency program after graduating from 
medical school, she chose Highland Memorial Hospital in Oakland "partly because 
it had a residents' union." 
</P>
<P>
When you are a doctor in training, "people really abuse you," she said. Her 
motivation in going to a union hospital was not just about making her life 
easier but to seek protection against bad working conditions that could result 
in poor patient care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stanley Borg, a senior resident at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center, 
is in a union, too, the Joint Council of Interns and Residents. But Los Angeles 
County sapped the union's strength -- intentionally, according to union members 
-- by transferring some doctors to the University of Southern California 
payroll, where they are not eligible for membership. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that neither the people who control hospitals nor the medical 
establishment would address their concerns, a group of California interns and 
residents have taken unionization among physicians to a new level. The 
California Assn. of Interns and Residents, about a quarter of the state's 8,000 
resident physicians, last month signed an affiliation agreement with the 
Service Employees International Union. CAIR includes a group of house staff 
organizations that bargain for interns and residents at specific institutions 
around the state. But its affiliation agreement with SEIU is the first time 
nationally that physicians-in-training have joined forces with an AFL-CIO 
member union. 
</P>
<P>
Among CAIR's major goals is a bargaining agreement with the University of 
California, which employs more than half of the state's resident physicians. 
The agreement includes a provision exempting the doctors from SEIU strike 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
SEIU, the nation's largest health-care union, counts a very small number of 
other physicians who work for public hospitals among its nearly 400,000 
health-care workers. But that might change soon, said Dan Stewart, organizing 
director for SEIU's health-care division, because an increasing number of 
doctors are salaried workers instead of professionals with their own business. 
"They are employees of HMOs (health maintenance organizations), or a group 
practice, or some doc-in-a-box chain (independent emergency clinics)," he said. 
SEIU is getting a trickle of interest from HMO doctors who want to know about 
the union but "aren't yet sure how their colleagues will feel," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the California doctors' alliance with SEIU is about a common 
labor concern: the quest for reasonable working conditions. But the 
unionization move also highlights a generational difference between young 
doctors and some in the medical establishment over what it takes to produce a 
competent, dedicated physician. 
</P>
<P>
"We had approached the administrations. We just found them to be unresponsive," 
said Dr. Carole Maccauley, the CAIR president who in June completed a residency 
in pediatrics at the UC Irvine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The major issue, CAIR said, is working conditions, including workweeks that 
stretch to 100 hours or more and shifts as long as 40 hours. CAIR also 
complains of physicians being made to perform tasks that they say are not 
essential to learning how to be a doctor. Broken promises from hospital 
administrations are another issue, Maccauley said. Others say they hope SEIU 
will give them the strength to prevent such tactics as Los Angeles County's 
move against the Joint Council of Interns and Residents. 
</P>
<P>
CAIR signed with SEIU less than a month after the American Board of Medical 
Specialties vetoed a recommendation by the Accreditation Council for Graduate 
Medical Education to put some limits on work hours for interns and residents. 
It would have allowed residents to be on overnight call no more than once every 
third night and would have guaranteed at least one day off a week. The proposal 
was supported by some teaching physicians, but it faced opposition from 
surgeons and other academics. The board said the measure was too specific to be 
applied to all residency programs. 
</P>
<P>
Interns and residents must put in long hours, said Dr. Ralph C. Jung, director 
of graduate medical education at the University of Southern California Health 
Sciences Center. "Interns and residents are apprentices. They are learning to 
intensely apply what they learned in school. This finite period -- three to 
seven years, depending on the specialty -- is the last opportunity to give them 
an intensified training to prepare them for the level of intensity in the 
profession. The question is, does the level of intensity have to be as harsh, 
as bad or as severe as some think it is?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the disagreement among his peers and doctors such as those in CAIR is 
generational, Jung said. "Young physicians are not willing to accept what 
physicians of my generation -- the over-45 generation -- were willing to accept 
as part of being dedicated to the field of medicine," he said. "There has to be 
an element of give and take on both sides. . . . Eighty hours is a reasonable 
compromise, so long as it isn't a hard-and-fast rule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
USC, the UC system and other private medical schools have proposed guidelines 
to limit residents' hours on a specialty-by-specialty basis. For its part, UC 
maintains that implementing the recommendations will require the General 
Assembly to give more money to the UC hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The older generation of physicians was overwhelmingly young, single men "who 
lived in the hospital" when they were interns and residents, said Londerville, 
who is in her second year of a three-year internal medicine program. "Residents 
today are adult men and women, people who are married, with a life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, today's interns and residents must do more during their working 
hours than the older generation simply because of the advances in the practice 
of medicine, she said. "There are more drugs to deal with. There are many 
sophisticated techniques to find out what's wrong with a patient," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The interns and residents say they typically work 36-hour shifts, but there is 
no such thing as a strictly defined shift, Londerville said. For example, she 
said she started one day last week at 7:30 a.m. "I admitted all patients until 
midnight," she said. Highland has a "night float" system in which a new group 
of residents and interns over night take care of patients admitted during the 
day. But Londerville said she had more work and didn't get to sleep until 4 
a.m. "I was awakened at 6 for a patient with a problem, and I worked throughout 
the day. . . . You work until the work is done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The concern about their long working hours overlaps with concerns about patient 
care, the interns and resident said. The long hours take a toll, they said. And 
although a few long weeks is not bad, Londerville said, "after six months of 
it, you're hardly human. . . . I'm not safe to drive a car after 40 hours on 
call," she added, yet "I'm expected to make life or death decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Academia's effort to establish some uniform work rules through the process of 
accrediting physician training programs came after states indicated that they 
would put limits on work hours. The New York State Health Department last year 
became the first to use state authority to mandate that interns and residents 
in most training programs work no more than 80 hours a week. The rules also ban 
shifts longer than 24 hours and require more supervision of the young doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The New York rules followed wide publicity of the death of the 18-year-old 
daughter of a prominent New York City journalist and author. The young woman 
died while in the care of interns and residents working the late-night shift at 
New York Hospital in Manhattan. A grand jury investigation found no criminal 
violations, but the panel was shocked at the residents' working conditions and 
recommended major changes in training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the shame of it. Does someone have to die for action to be taken?" said 
Borg, president of the Los Angeles County union. Borg's group supported a bill 
to impose similar limits in California. But the General Assembly killed the 
legislation in August. The California Medical Assn. opposed it, Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are health and safety matters. It is increasingly dangerous within these 
institutions," CAIR Executive Director Allen Brill said, citing a UC-San 
Francisco survey showing that a quarter of residents in one department of the 
teaching facility had accidentally stuck themselves with needles -- a 
frightening statistic in the era of AIDS. "Residents don't get disability 
benefits," Brill said. 
</P>
<P>
Long working hours and accidents are probably related, said Dr. Bill Plautz, a 
resident at San Francisco General Hospital and CAIR vice president. "Common 
sense would tell you that if you work people that long, that fatigue will set 
in, and mistakes and accidents will happen. . . . Interns and residents are 
handling deadly materials -- infected blood and the like. It would make sense 
to provide them with some protection, just as airline pilots and truck drivers 
get some protection," Plautz said. 
</P>
<P>
Exacerbating matters, the interns and residents say, is that many teaching 
hospitals won't hire adequate support staff and use interns and residents to 
fill the gaps. "Interns and residents are the putty that fill in all the cracks 
at the hospital," Londerville said. "If a patient needs an EKG and there is no 
technician on duty on the weekend, the resident has to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Interns and residents have a harder time in county hospitals, Borg said. "Your 
exposure is twofold," he said. The county recently cut staff at its outpatient 
clinics, he said. The patient load hasn't decreased, so "the people who pick up 
the slack are the interns and residents." 
</P>
<P>
The staff cutbacks make it more difficult for people to take advantage of 
preventive outpatient services, he said. More end up in the hospital, further 
taxing "an already stressful situation" for the staff. Interns and residents do 
some chores because there aren't enough nurses, he added. "It is not uncommon 
that, if a patient needs to go to surgery, for the interns and residents to put 
him on a gurney and take him there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Borg said his group -- at one time one of the largest unions of interns and 
residents in the county -- decided not to join CAIR because it wants to see how 
the affiliation with SEIU works out. The union has had a contract with Los 
Angeles County for nearly 20 years. But it is suing the county because the 
transfer of interns and residents at County-USC Medical Center to the USC 
payroll cut the union's membership to about 800 doctors working at King and 
Harbor UCLA Medical Center from about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The County-USC interns and residents receive a stipend and have no collective 
bargaining rights, Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have given the county until 1991 to prove that the transfer of the 
County-USC staff was designed to save money instead of destroying the union, 
Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his group did not join the SEIU affiliation, Borg said, he was in 
favor of the move. "My personal opinion is that the affiliation can only be 
beneficial. . . . Interns and residents are caught in the middle between being 
a student and an employee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THEIR COMPLAINTS 
</P>
<P>
An organization representing about one-fourth of California's 8,000 medical 
interns and residents has affiliated with the Service Employees International 
Union, the nation's largest health-care union. The affiliation is the first 
such alliance with big labor. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors-in-training have these chief complaints: 
</P>
<P>
* Long hours: The workweek sometimes extends to 100 hours, with single shifts 
of up to 40 hours. 
</P>
<P>
* Safety: Fatigue can compromise patient care and increase the risk of 
accidents -- such as needle pricks -- that could expose doctors to infections. 
</P>
<P>
* Irrelevant work: Tasks such as drawing blood, running tests and transporting 
patients are often done by interns, they feel, because hospitals lack adequate 
support staff.

FERTILIZER COST FEELING EFFECT OF GULF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: SUPPLIERS ARE PASSING ALONG TO FARMERS THE HIGHER PRICES THEY MUST 
PAY FOR NATURAL GAS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PRODUCTION PROCESS.

<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis is inflating the cost of fertilizers farmers use to 
help their crops grow, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer costs are moving up because the Middle East provides much of the 
natural gas that produces ammonia and urea, says Steven R. Beckley, general 
manager of the California Fertilizer Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Ammonia and urea are vital components of fertilizer because they are "the 
building blocks for nitrogen products," Beckley explains. 
</P>
<P>
So, with some Middle East sources of nitrogen-based fertilizers shut off and 
others unstable at the moment, suppliers around the world have raised their 
prices, Beckley adds. That includes ammonia fertilizers from Alaska and British 
Columbia, where California dealers get their supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary, but nitrogen fertilizers generally are up about 10%, says Bob 
Krauter of the California Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Beckley says prices of phosphate fertilizers have also inched up because some 
Middle East countries provide sulfuric acid used in phosphate rock, the 
building block for those compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ammonia-based or nitrogen fertilizers keep plants green and make them grow 
rapidly while phosphates give the roots strength, Beckley says. 
</P>
<P>
California's fertilizer industry is tiny because the state doesn't have large 
reserves of natural gas, Beckley adds. The only producer he knows of in the 
state is a potash plant in the Trona area of San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the state doesn't have the basic resources, Beckley thinks that its 
sources of fertilizer are secure because they're largely domestic: phosphates 
from Wyoming and Idaho, in addition to ammonia from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
California farmers haven't been hit too hard by higher fertilizer prices yet 
because most crops have been in harvest the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern will be what will happen now," the Farm Bureau's Krauter said. "If 
the crisis does extend into next year, we'll be into the spring planting 
season."

Mortgage Rates Decline: Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.13% in the week ending 
Saturday, down from 10.17% the previous week, according to a national survey by 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, 
lenders were asking an average initial rate of 8.15%, down from 8.17%. The 
rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

Mag Instrument Inc. Sues Over Flashlights: The Ontario-based firm sued 
Marketing Innovations International in Calabasas for violating patents on six 
flashlights on which Mag claims to hold rights. 
</P>
<P>
The federal lawsuit asserts that Marketing Innovations International violated 
the patents for regular and miniature flashlights "by selling flashlights 
embodying the inventions described in patents" obtained by Mag from 1986 to 
1990. In the suit, Mag seeks triple damages and to stop the other company from 
selling the flashlights. Mag also wants a list of firms who purchased the 
flashlights. (Case No. 90-5900. Filed Nov. 1, 1990).

Fairchild Sued Over Toxic Cleanup: Rohr Industries Inc. of Chula Vista sued 
Fairchild Industries Inc., both makers of aircraft parts, for breach of 
contract and the costs of cleaning up toxics from land that Fairchild sold to 
Rohr. The Los Angeles Federal Court lawsuit said the 1987 purchase agreement 
Rohr had with the Chantilly, Va., firm required Fairchild to indemnify Rohr for 
up to $20,000 for any liability claims stemming from the property in 
Hagerstown, Md. 
</P>
<P>
It also certified that the property was in compliance with all laws, the suit 
said. Rohr said the state found the former site contaminated with hazardous 
chemicals two years later and ordered Rohr to clean it up. The suit seeks at 
least $20,000 in cleanup costs and other unspecified damages. (Case No. 90- 
5838. Filed Oct. 30, 1990)

TRUMP HAS TO AUCTION FLORIDA CONDO UNITS

<P>
Lenders are forcing Donald J. Trump to auction more than 100 unsold condominium 
units at the Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches in order to pay down his debt, the 
Miami Herald reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five condos ranging in price from $229,200 to $1.8 million will be 
auctioned at discount prices Dec. 16 at The Breakers in Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bids will start at $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The auction will be broadcast via satellite to bidders in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents said Trump may also be on the verge of selling Mar-a-Lago, 
the 118-room oceanfront estate he bought in Palm Beach for $10 million five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion, which has 53 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms and three bomb shelters, is 
not officially on the market. It would be expected to fetch $30 million to $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The condo auctions are expected to net about $15 million, more than $10 million 
less than what Trump owes on them. 
</P>
<P>
Trump bought the Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches out of foreclosure in 1986 for 
$40 million. Marine Midland Bank holds a $27.1-million mortgage on the 221-unit 
complex, located on the Intracoastal Waterway. 
</P>
<P>
The auctions are part of a reprieve that the bank granted Trump. His loan was 
due Oct. 22, and he had to deposit $1 million with Marine Midland to get it 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has until Sept. 30 to unload the remaining units. Fewer than half have 
been sold.

Copley Newspaper Layoffs: Blaming declining revenue, the company that publishes 
the Outlook, Daily Breeze and News-Pilot newspapers laid off 2% of the papers' 
800 workers in the Los Angeles area. No further layoffs are planned, said a 
spokeswoman for Copley Los Angeles Newspapers, a division of La Jolla-based 
Copley Press. She said the company had tried to avert layoffs by not filling 
jobs that became vacant and by taking other cost-cutting moves.

Shareholder Sues Carolco, Stallone: A derivative shareholder's suit was filed 
against Mario Kassar, chairman of Carolco Pictures Inc., and 13 other officers 
and directors of the firm, including actor Sylvester Stallone, alleging that 
they improperly approved the purchase of stock from Kassar. The Los Angeles 
Superior Court lawsuit filed on behalf of Carolco stockholder Benjamin Fleisig 
alleges breach of fiduciary duty in the approval of a repurchase Sept. 24 of 
3.4 million shares of Carolco stock from Kassar. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Kassar sold the stock for $45 million, or $13 a share, giving him 
a profit of $11.5 million over his acquisition cost. The price was $5.75 above 
the most recent closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, the suit said.

IPO TEST FOR CRUTTENDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's tough enough to find buyers for blue chip stocks nowadays. Yet Newport 
Beach-based brokerage Cruttenden &amp; Co. is taking the gutsy step of trying 
to sell a new stock offering of a virtual start-up company. If Cruttenden can 
pull it off in this bear market, it may earn a lot more respect from its larger 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Cruttenden is working with brokerage Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis to 
launch the initial public offering of Irvine-based Oncotech Inc. The firm, 
incorporated in 1985, has developed new technology that can help doctors 
determine which types of treatment are most effective for different cancer 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
The potential market for Oncotech's tests is huge: More than 1 million people 
are diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States. A major problem is 
that doctors often aren't sure which treatment is best for an individual 
patient. Some tumors, for example, are highly resistant to chemotherapy. But a 
doctor may have no idea how the tumor -- or the patient -- will respond until 
the treatment is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech's tests use tumor tissue samples to determine whether the tumor will 
react to particular treatment regimens. The big payoff from the tests is that a 
patient can be spared the painful side effects of treatments that won't work 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech's tests are attracting rising interest in the medical community: 
Revenue jumped to $1.07 million in 1989 from $195,954 in 1988. In the first six 
months of this year, revenue totaled $707,841, up 86% from the same period in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm still is losing money because of high development costs. The 
first-half 1990 loss was $1.13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Presson, Cruttenden's corporate finance chief, admits that Oncotech 
probably is 18 to 24 months from break-even. But he said the excitement over 
the technology is what led Cruttenden to chance a public stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the move even more risky is that this is Cruttenden's first attempt 
at managing a new stock offering. The brokerage has had a strong presence in 
Newport for many years, but underwriting is a high-stakes business for a small 
firm. Because of that, Presson says Oncotech wanted a more experienced hand 
helping with the offering. So Cruttenden tapped Dain Bosworth, whose 
Minneapolis base is home to many of the same types of medical-tech firms that 
populate Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech wants to sell 1.3 million shares to investors. Initially, the firm had 
hoped for a price of about $8 a share. But rival investment bankers say the 
weakness in the stock market suggests that the best the firm can hope for is a 
price of about $5. That would raise $6.5 million for Oncotech, which would be 
used for equipment, research and marketing. Management and the firm's original 
financiers would retain 61% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Presson hopes to sell the shares late this week. He says institutional 
investors have been "very excited" about Oncotech at Cruttenden's "road show" 
presentations. Cruttenden's goal is to sell 85% of the shares to institutions, 
the rest to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Can Cruttenden make the deal fly? The key issue, Presson admits, will be 
keeping the stock above the offering price once it begins trading. The 
experience of many investors who have purchased new stocks this year has been 
disastrous: Many of the stocks have plunged well below their offering prices. 
Thus, some investors' attitude is, why buy a new stock in an offering when you 
can probably get it cheaper after it begins trading? 
</P>
<P>
Presson says Cruttenden believes that most of the buyers for Oncotech will be 
"long-term holders" rather than traders who would bail out if the stock doesn't 
rise immediately. Of course, the long-term holder is the buyer most investment 
bankers target, but institutions often say one thing and do another. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Oncotech offering will be a good litmus test of investors' 
willingness to finance the kind of promising young Southland companies that 
badly need funding today. And it will be a major test of Cruttenden's ability 
to make a name for itself in the dicey but lucrative business of stock 
underwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Ever wonder why they call them "bull" and "bear" markets? The bear 
term apparently originated in the early 1700s in England, from a proverb 
warning against "selling the bearskin before one has caught the bear." In other 
words, even back then there were "short" sellers who were selling securities 
they didn't own, on the expectation that they could repay the borrowed 
securities later for less. Another explanation is that bull and bear derive 
from the ways the two animals fight: The bull throws its horns upward; the bear 
stands and swipes downward. But in truth, "it's never really been settled" 
where the terms actually came into use, or why, says market historian Yale 
Hirsch of Stock Trader's Almanac in Old Tappan, N.J. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Traders of Caesars World stock are still waiting to see if someone was 
accumulating the shares earlier in October. Anyone buying more than 5% would 
have to publicly declare the stake. But as of Oct. 17, the only 5%-plus holder 
was the Wisconsin Investment Board, which owned 8.9%, according to Caesars' 
proxy for its annual meeting set for Nov. 29.

The National Assn. of Securities Dealers within a few weeks will seek federal 
approval to cap the fees a mutual fund can charge investors. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.2-trillion mutual fund industry, entrusted with the savings of one in 
every four American families, has drawn sharp criticism from investors who are 
confused and angered by a complex array of fees. 
</P>
<P>
In letters to the SEC, individual investors called aspects of the current fee 
structure "a joke" and "a monster." 
</P>
<P>
The NASD rules, if approved by the SEC, would cover the vast majority of mutual 
funds -- those sold by the 4,000 securities dealers who are members of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual funds can charge three types of fees to cover sales-related expenses. 
Many funds employ various combinations of these fees. 
</P>
<P>
Because each type is assessed in a different way, it can be tough for investors 
to calculate their true cost and then to comparison-shop among funds, said John 
Taylor, NASD's director of investment companies. 
</P>
<P>
In its rule to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD is 
proposing that fees never exceed the equivalent of 8.5% of a fund's gross 
sales. When that cap is reached, no additional fees would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
SEC approval is required for the rule to take effect. It has won the backing of 
members of the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
But the SEC may decide to include the proposal as part of its overhaul of the 
50-year-old law that governs the fast-growing mutual fund industry, said SEC 
Assistant Director Matthew Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The agency completed gathering comments last month on how to update the 1940 
Investment Company Act. It now has folders several feet high packed with 
recommendations. SEC officials expect to complete their proposals by early next 
year, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
Now NASD is only permitted to impose an 8.5% cap on front-end sales charges, a 
fee that an investor pays on buying into a fund. Broker-sold funds, which 
account for about half of all sales, usually charge such front-end loads, said 
the Investment Company Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Directly marketed funds that often employ toll-free telephone numbers and 
solicit investors through media advertisements generally prefer contingent 
deferred sales loads, also known as back-end loads, and 12b-1 fees, known as 
asset-based fees. 
</P>
<P>
The former are levied on withdrawals and use a sliding scale that disappears 
after an investment has been held for a certain period. The latter are annual 
charges of about 0.1% to 0.2% of net assets. 
</P>
<P>
NASD said it is "anomalous" that it can place limits only on front-end sales. 
It also wants to prohibit funds from stating they are "no load" or have "no 
sales charge" if they include asset-based fees. 
</P>
<P>
The rule would delight some investors. K. C. Gupta of Skokie, Ill., in a letter 
to the SEC, called "no load" a joke. "The term has an obvious literal meaning, 
but the lawyers and greedy fund promoters have so far gotten the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
R. Bruce Oliver, retired chairman of the John Hancock family of mutual funds, 
called 12b-1 fees "a monster" that should be abolished or strictly limited. 
</P>
<P>
"A Pandora's box has been opened that truly has provided an unanticipated 
increase in adviser profits" without any concomitant increase in the advisers' 
fiduciary responsibilities, Oliver told the SEC.

CITICORP ISSUE TAKES ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the part of the movie "Fantasia" where Mickey Mouse, the Sorcerer's 
Apprentice, uses magic to get a broom to carry water for him but then can't get 
it to stop? Put yourself in Mickey's shoes, and you understand how John Reed, 
chairman of Citicorp, must feel when he contemplates Citicorp's auction-rate 
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
This is a sophisticated security bought by corporations. Its dividend rises and 
falls every 49 days or less at so-called investor auctions. It was a great idea 
once, but now it's become an expensive menace -- and as Mickey discovered, it's 
not so easy to turn off once you start it up. 
</P>
<P>
When Citicorp, the country's biggest bank company, first peddled auction-rate 
preferred five years ago, the stock was as magical as Mickey's broom. Thanks to 
a loophole in the tax code, the preferred gave Citicorp very cheap money while 
giving the stock's owners a very high return. It was so popular that Citi 
peddled 10 different issues totaling $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
But those glory days are gone, with Citicorp in financial trouble and investors 
demanding and getting junk-like 13% dividends to buy the preferred. Not only is 
the preferred costing Citicorp money that it can ill afford, but it has also 
begun generating dangerous publicity, which it also can't afford. Every time an 
auction is held and Citi has to pay a usurious rate, it produces more bad press 
on investors' doubts about Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
So why doesn't Citicorp just buy back the preferred stock with the billions of 
dollars of credit that it says it has available? Money that would cost less 
than 13%? 
</P>
<P>
The official answer is that Citicorp doesn't want to be driven out of any 
market for capital. The real answer, I think, is that preferred stock counts as 
capital under bank holding company rules, but borrowed money doesn't, and 
Citicorp doesn't want to lose any capital, no matter how expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is the money banks must keep on hand to cushion themselves against hard 
times; you compute the ratio of capital to assets to determine whether the bank 
is sound. Replacing $950 million of preferred with $950 million of borrowed 
money would reduce that ratio, which wouldn't exactly thrill Citicorp's 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
How does money costing 13% get to be considered capital? The answer, to 
oversimplify, is that Citicorp issued this stuff with a promise to pay 
dividends at the going rate, which is determined at an auction every seven 
weeks or so. Unlike a bond or note, however, this security has no due date; 
it's called a perpetual issue. That means you can't demand your money back from 
Citicorp (and which is why the company can count the stock as capital). If 
you're holding the stuff and want to get rid of it, you have to hope someone 
buys it from you at one of these auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term risk is that if there are no buyers, your short-term investment 
could turn into a long-term one. The long-term risk is that regulators will 
strip Citibank from Citicorp, making it difficult if not impossible for the 
holding company to pay its bills, including the dividend on your preferred 
stock. In that case, your short-term investment would turn into a long-term 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Before we go any further, you need to remember that Citicorp isn't Citibank, 
and it's important not to confuse the two. Citicorp, which is the issuer of the 
auction-rate preferred stock, is a bank holding company. Citibank, the nation's 
largest bank, is Citicorp's main subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Even though I think Citicorp could some day stiff some or all of its creditors, 
I don't think that Citibank will stiff depositors, even those whose accounts 
aren't fully covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The reason: the 
FDIC's too-big-to-fail doctrine, under which the FDIC protects all of a giant 
bank's depositors, including those with accounts greater than the $100,000 
maximum that the FDIC insures. The reasoning is that an uncontrolled collapse 
of a giant bank could ruin the nation's economy, if not the entire world. 
</P>
<P>
But too-big-to-fail, as FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said in an interview, 
covers banks, not the holding companies that own the banks. The difference is 
crucial. Three times now -- when it put big, busted Texas institutions to sleep 
-- the FDIC has tried to strip holding companies of their banks, so that the 
depositors are protected and holding company stockholders and creditors get 
wiped. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Citicorp and its run-amok preferred. The stock owes its 
very existence to a loophole in the federal tax code. Corporations that collect 
dividends can exclude 70% of them from federal tax under most circumstances. 
Interest, by contrast, is fully taxable. Do the math, and you see that to a 
corporation, a 10% preferred stock is as good as a 13.5% bond. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Citicorp's 13% dividend gives a corporate owner the equivalent of 
an 18.5% bond. Which is why corporate treasurers keep buying this stuff even 
though it's risky. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of getting stuck is more than theoretical. After Shearson Lehman Bros. 
bought some MCorp auction preferred to keep the auction illusion alive, 
Shearson got stuck holding paper of a bankrupt company. Holders of Lomas &amp; 
Nettleton auction-type notes were similarly burned. 
</P>
<P>
Some other bank companies that, like Citicorp, are in not-such-wonderful shape 
have redeemed their auction-rate preferred. These include the parent companies 
of Manufacturers Hanover, Mellon Bank and First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp wants people to think that it will call in the preferred soon if rates 
on it don't drop. We'll see. But if all else fails, John Reed can try to do 
what Mickey did in "Fantasia." Which is to scream loud enough to buy enough 
time for a wizard to bail him out.

MARY MARTIN SOARS IN AUDIENCES' HEARTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIBUTE: FIERCELY DEDICATED TO HER WORK, THE ACTRESS ALWAYS GAVE HER BEST TO A 
PUBLIC THAT ADORED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Martin made her first big splash in show business singing a song entitled 
"My Heart Belongs to Daddy." The truth is, her heart belonged to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who died Saturday of cancer at age 76, had a lifelong love affair with 
audiences. It was a mutual affection that washed across both sides of the 
footlights as she created and played such roles as Nellie Forbush (in "South 
Pacific"), Maria (in "The Sound of Music") and especially Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pan seems to be a show everyone recalls with special fondness. When 
Martin was guest of honor at a TV festival screening of "Peter Pan" here three 
years ago, you could feel the excitment build as men and women in their 
thirtysomethings -- obviously remembering the show from their own childhoods -- 
poured in, bringing along their own little ones as if to pass on a magic legacy 
to a new generation. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the screening was to start, a man in one of the front rows 
spontaneously stood up and said to the sold-out audience: "When Miss Martin 
comes in, let's all stand up and crow!" . . . which everyone did. 
</P>
<P>
Martin immediately responsed with her own loud "er er, er errrrrrrrrh!" which 
set off a another round of crowing in the packed theater. When the audience at 
last was quiet, the actress, obviously moved, admitted: "I believe I'm rather 
undone. . . . The amount of emotion here tonight is something I'll never 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
She often said -- and repeated that night -- that she'd love to play Peter Pan 
in New York's huge Madison Square Garden "because the further up you go, the 
faster you can fly. I'd go out through a window, and honey, I wouldn't come 
back!" How she loved to soar and fly as Peter Pan, the symbol of youth and joy 
and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was dedicated to her work, and when she was doing a show, it was the 
sole focus of her life. She would give up luncheons and parties and playtime 
because she felt she should devote all her energy to her performance. She had 
to be at her best, give her best to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
She was intrigued and touched by what she called "The circles of my life . . . 
how people and places always come back, a circle and a circle and a circle, 
dissolving and expanding, touching other circles." And indeed, people she knew 
and adored, and who knew and adored her, seemed sooner or later to return to 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
She could be with heads of state, the royalty of the theater world, a fan of 
great or meager means. Her warmth, charm, sincerity, love touched them all. 
</P>
<P>
Having lunch with her at a restaurant was rather like being in a reception line 
. . . a constant stream of folks saying hello when they spotted her, recalling 
a favorite stage role, expressing their admiration. She graciously talked to 
each one, signing an autograph, posing for a snapshot, listening to what they 
had to say. 
</P>
<P>
When she was seriously injured in a traffic accident several years ago in San 
Francisco, she amazed everyone by being back on her feet within a few weeks. 
She was hosting the television series "Over Easy" at the time, a program keyed 
to the over-40 generation, and she pushed herself to get back because "I have 
to be an inspiration for them, let them know never give up." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with fewer stage roles occupying her life, she was able to 
enjoy more time with her family, her son, actor Larry Hagman (whom she 
generally referred to as "my darling baby boy"), and her daughter, Heller. And 
she doted on the fact that she was a great-grandmother of a little girl, also 
named Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Martin seemed never to forget that, early on, she had been told she had no 
talent and should go back home to Weatherford, Tex., and forget show business. 
But "never say never" was one of her credos, and undaunted, she tried out for 
so many roles she became known as "Audition Mary." She ended up a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Whether washing that man right out of her hair, or teaching "Doe a deer, a 
female deer" or flying as Peter Pan, Mary Martin was the best of the best. She 
lived -- and loved -- to make people happy and feel good. 
</P>
<P>
At that emotion-charged, electric screening of "Peter Pan" here three years 
ago, she ended the evening by saying: "Thank you all for the spirit of my life. 
It will never end, because when I go, I'll be hanging up there as a star." 
</P>
<P>
And now, not only the hills, but the heavens are alive with the sound of her 
music.

WHO'S AFRAID OF ART MARKET?; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: NOT ELIZABETH TAYLOR, WHO WILL SELL HER PRIZED VAN GOGH IN LONDON 
DESPITE AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CLIMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy looks so gloomy and the art market has flattened out so much that 
many prospective sellers of valuable artworks are waiting for a more propitious 
time to liquidate their treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Not actress Elizabeth Taylor. She has consigned her prized Vincent van Gogh 
painting, "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy," to the auction 
block. The 1889 landscape is expected to bring between $16 million and $22 
million on Dec. 3 at Christie's London. The actress bought the painting for 
$257,600 at a London auction in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
If the selling price falls within the auction house's estimate, Taylor's 
painting will be among the most expensive Van Goghs to be sold at auction, but 
it won't approach a record. The highest auction price for a Van Gogh -- and for 
any artwork -- is $82.5 million, paid last May by Japanese paper manufacturer 
Ryoei Saito for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" a few months 
after he had committed himself to an asylum in Southern France. In a letter to 
his brother, Theo, the Dutch artist said that the painting celebrates nature 
with "autumn effects glorious in color, green skies contrasting with foliage in 
yellows, oranges, greens." 
</P>
<P>
Executed the year before Van Gogh committed suicide, the painting comes from 
the most vigorous and highly valued period of the artist's short career. The 
fact that "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" has been shown in 
prestigious museums around the world indicates that it is considered a notable 
example of his work. The Metropolitan Museum of Art included the landscape in 
the 1986-87 landmark exhibition, "Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor bought the painting while she was married to actor Richard Burton. She 
had begun collecting art in the mid-'50s and had been looking for a Van Gogh 
for 12 years, according to the auction house. Her father, London art dealer 
Francis Taylor, reportedly advised the Burtons to go to Paris during the 
auction and to bid in secrecy to keep the price down. 
</P>
<P>
The Burtons hung the painting in their home in Gstaad, Switzerland, for several 
years. Later they remodeled their yacht Kalizma (named for Taylor's and 
Burton's children, Kate Burton, Liza Todd and Maria Burton) to accommodate the 
painting. The yacht, which was docked on the Thames River, was home to the 
Burtons on their frequent visits to London. They lived on board to circumvent 
British laws that prevented them from importing their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor kept the painting after her divorce from Burton. In recent years she has 
displayed it in her home in Bel-Air. The actress declined to explain why she is 
selling the Van Gogh. An auction house official would only say that the 
consignment was "a personal decision." 
</P>
<P>
Although the auction forecast is bleak for the fall season, this is the second 
multimillion-dollar Van Gogh to be offered. Christie's New York will test the 
Van Gogh market on Nov. 14 when a 1890 still life, "Vase With Cornflowers and 
Poppies," goes on the block at an estimated price of $12 million to $16 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh market has gone wild in the past four years, starting with the 
sale of "Sunflowers" for $39.9 million to a Japanese insurance company on March 
31, 1987. Five and a half months later, on Nov. 11, 1987, "Irises" sold for 
$53.9 million to Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. When Bond's financial 
empire subsequently tumbled, "Irises" was quietly put up for sale. The J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Malibu bought it earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
The "Irises" record held until last May, when it was shattered by the 
astonishing sum of $82.5 million paid for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." Among other 
Van Gogh paintings that have commanded more than $10 million at auction are 
"Bridge at Trinquetaille" ($20.24 million),"Portrait of Adeline Ravoux" ($13.75 
million) and "Romans Parisiens (Les Livres Jaune)" ($12.2 million).

The star guns of November. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only recently I was watching Sharon Gless on a talk show promoting her new CBS 
series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill." Now she's on TV promoting another cause, 
appearing in a 30-second spot urging Californians to vote against the so-called 
"term-limit" initiatives, Propositions 131 and 140, in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
I'm confused. 
</P>
<P>
The face of this authority figure I instantly recognize. But in warning, "Don't 
be lulled into the term-limit trap," is Gless speaking as crack lawyer Rosie 
O'Neill? Or as crack cop Chris Cagney of her former series, "Cagney &amp; 
Lacey?" Or is Gless speaking as Gless? 
</P>
<P>
Should I vote against these initiatives because Rosie O'Neill is a swell, 
vulnerable human being? Or because I admired the way Chris Cagney battled 
alcoholism? Or am I to vote no just because Gless herself says I should? 
</P>
<P>
But I've never met Gless. I've never spoken to her. I don't know whether she's 
smart or dumb, whether she has studied and understands these ballot initiatives 
or is merely parroting the opinions of still other people I've never met or 
spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
All I really know about Gless is that she's an actress. And wow, here's a 
terrifying thought: What if another actress, Gless' "Cagney &amp; Lacey" 
co-star, Tyne Daly, were to tape a commercial advocating Propositions 131 or 
140? Some dilemma this would be. Would I support Cagney or Lacey? 
</P>
<P>
My head is already spinning. 
</P>
<P>
Look, trust me. This column has nothing at all to do with the pros and cons of 
anything or anyone on the ballot. It has everything to do with the wielding of 
celebrityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is especially pertinent at a time when Californians are about to 
navigate a thick maze of ballot measures so complex and confusing that voters 
may be more vulnerable than usual to video bumper stickers featuring the 
simplistic urgings of stars. 
</P>
<P>
Peaking when Ronald Reagan was elected President, the mingling of star power 
and politics goes back years and years. And these days Gless is hardly the only 
show-business celebrity on California's TV stump. The list of those taping 
election spots also includes Michael Landon, Ted Danson, Clint Eastwood, John 
Ritter, Ali MacGraw, Tracy Nelson, Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Richard 
Dysart, Lloyd Bridges and Walter Matthau. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently it was "Murder, She Wrote" star Angela Lansbury who was warning 
viewers not to be lured into the "term-limit trap." Facing a tide of criticism 
for starring in a political spot accused in some circles of being misleading, 
however, Lansbury withdrew as a TV spokesperson for the campaign against 
Propositions 131 and 140 after claiming she'd been "duped." Her son and 
spokesman, David Shaw, was quoted as saying his mother "doesn't really read 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
An actress speaking out before doing her homework is an easy target, and it's 
tempting to use Lansbury to justify advocating term limits on celebrity 
political endorsements. However, her debacle is no reason to discourage other 
celebrities from speaking out on politics or other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that a celebrity who trades on his or her favorable public image by 
taking positions on crucial issues without much thought abuses a trust and 
deserves criticism. 
</P>
<P>
But let's apply a best-case scenario to Gless and her fellow celebrity 
campaigners by assuming that they did indeed study and feel fervently about 
these election issues before going public with their views. 
</P>
<P>
Let's assume also that these celebrities understand how fantasy rubs off on 
real life -- they were recruited as spokespeople because of the credibility or 
likability of their on-camera personas, after all -- and that some voters may 
follow their lead merely because of who they are or the characters they play as 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
So what? Freedom of speech is a constitutional right. Why shouldn't these 
people exploit their persuasiveness as celebrities to advance causes they 
consider worthy? If you believe in something you go for it, using the tools at 
your disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The greater responsibility lies with the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the celebrity's fault that there may be some noodles out there -- no 
one knows how many -- who inexplicably take their cues from a famous face 
without knowing even if the face is accompanied by a brain. 
</P>
<P>
That fame alone carries credibility in some quarters reflects the extent to 
which we have become a celebrity-driven society. We at once whip celebrities -- 
by supporting the tabloids and gossipy TV shows that victimize them -- and 
worship celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities speak to us from 30-second spots, telling us how to vote. They 
speak to us from product commercials, telling us how to look. They speak to us 
from talk shows, telling us how to live. And celebrity anchors speak to us from 
their newscasts, telling us what to think. In fact, we are frequently drawn to 
these newscasts because the anchors are celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
As it was all those years when Robert Young wore his Marcus Welby 
trustworthiness while prescribing Sanka, or the way it continues to be with 
Karl Malden donning his San Francisco cop's credibility to hawk American 
Express, the celebrity and the role are shrewdly merged for the purpose of 
making a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Yet coffee and travelers' checks are hardly of cosmic importance compared with 
the issues facing Californians on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Is that Michael Landon addressing us on screen in behalf of Proposition 128, or 
is it Jonathan Smith, the wise and benevolent angel of "Highway to Heaven"? Or 
on the other hand, does it really matter, and why should we heed either of 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Voters beware: Don't be lured into the celebrity trap.

"Our machines are working wonderfully," says Rosalyn Lever, assistant registrar

In 1970, the county's old computer system gagged and totals were delayed two 
days. In 1980, a new system snarled, resulting in a four-day delay. "Oh, God,

BESIEGED LIBRARY BOSS PONDERS HOW MUTINY OF EMPLOYEES STARTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Richard doesn't think he's a bad boss. As head of Orange County's oldest 
library system, he is in charge of a $614,000 book budget, largest in city 
history. He persuaded the City Council to renovate and expand the Central 
Library for $1.5 million, the first major remodeling for the 30-year-old 
building. And he launched one of the nation's first Spanish-language 
bookmobiles to encourage the Latino community to use the library. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard, 43, has found himself fending off a mutiny by his own employees, 
some of whom called him "terrifying." Some of the librarians wear anti-Richard 
buttons. One employee told union representatives that if he had a gun, "I would 
blow (Richard's) head off." 
</P>
<P>
Those icy reactions have stunned the usually low-keyed Richard, who directs the 
city's main library and two branches. In a recent interview, he bristled when 
told that his employees call him a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never yelled or screamed at any employee," said Richard, who acknowledges 
that he frankly does not understand what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done my best to be fair," Richard said. "If I was half the ogre the staff 
says I am, I don't think I could ever survive." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 36 of the 52 library employees have signed a petition declaring 
that they lack confidence in Richard. In a report to the City Council in June, 
the Santa Ana library board -- a citizens advisory group -- admonished Richard, 
declaring that communication between him and his staff is a major problem. And 
at two recent council meetings, library employees have filled the chambers, 
demanding that City Manager David N. Ream fire their boss. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been so distressing," said Richard. "I don't believe the entire staff 
feels this way. When I walk through the libraries, some individuals have come 
up to me and told me they support me. But it's still hard." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana librarians, some of whom have asked that their names be withheld 
because they fear retribution, say they cannot work under Richard's management 
style, which they described as "threatening." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Hitler," said Barbara Lambert, a senior library assistant who has 
worked for the Santa Ana library system for 24 years. "He says to us, 'You 
can't do this, you can't do that.' We don't talk to him, he dictates to us." 
</P>
<P>
Known for being an impeccable dresser who pays attention to detail, Richard 
watches over the city library much like a businessman. He worries about 
"customer satisfaction" and whether sections of the libraries are "utilized 
fully." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps a tiny office, always neat, at the Old City Hall on 3rd and Main 
streets. An auto racing buff, he has a print of a Grand Prix racer hanging on 
the wall. And photos of his four daughters are kept behind his desk, along with 
stacks of blueprints on the library's renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said the librarians who complain are simply resisting change that he 
has put in place since he became director four years ago. Both sides agree that 
the dispute began three years ago when Richard changed past policies regarding 
work schedules and pay. The dispute deepened earlier this year when Richard 
began the first phrase of the renovation project by asking employees to weed 
out -- and discard -- thousands of books to make room for new ones. The weeding 
disturbed many of the librarians who did not want to discard any books, 
according to the library board's report. 
</P>
<P>
Richard downplays the weeding controversy and said the librarians were given 
several months' notice of the procedure and that all the books were carefully 
screened. Books were only discarded if they had not been checked out at least 
once over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Richard is convinced that the city's employee union is responsible for 
continuing the dispute. He notes that union president Ed Bentley, a supervisor 
at the city's car-fleet division, is up for reelection and that the city 
employee contract is up for renewal next year. 
</P>
<P>
If people are so upset, Richard says, why has no one come forward with a 
specific complaint to him or the city's civil service department, which settles 
employee grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"This dispute has been run like a campaign," Richard said. "The charges have 
been unsubstantiated and come from anonymous rumors. There's never been a 
specific incident, and it's always been vague." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said the union contract and his reelection have nothing to do with 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
"The dispute has been going on for two years," Bentley said. "This is not about 
contracts or the union. This is about how afraid the employees are." 
</P>
<P>
Richard began his career as a librarian aide at Fullerton Library where he 
worked full time while attending Chapman College. He received a degree in 
biology specializing in marine science before switching to library science for 
his master's at Cal State Fullerton. After obtaining his graduate degree, he 
was promoted to librarian at Fullerton and subsequently moved to the county's 
public library system. He became the assistant library director in Long Beach 
and then directed libraries in Sacramento for five years before moving to Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Former colleagues and employees of Richard say they were shocked by the 
controversy in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Cordelia Howard, director of Long Beach libraries, said she worked for Richard 
for 18 months without any problems. At the time, Richard was head of Long 
Beach's main library as well as the city's 11 branches. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an absolute gentleman and supportive of the staff," Howard said. "I 
can't believe this is happening to Rob Richard. Nobody's management style can 
change that much." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Johnson, who retired as Fullerton Library director in September, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever complained about Rob," Johnson said. "This is utterly amazing."

SOME FEAR DEVELOPMENT IN DANA POINT;

RESIDENTS AND FIRMS COULD BE UPROOTED

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A warm morning sun was shining into the living room of her apartment on 
downtown Del Prado Avenue, but Louise Cole was not feeling rosy. 
</P>
<P>
These were supposed to be the golden years for the 76-year-old widow, but her 
recent knee surgery and the thought that she may be uprooted from her home of 
22 years had her feeling cold and uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terrified," Cole said. "I'm hearing that they may take my home and my 
livelihood away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Cole is one of a growing number of residents and business owners in this 
coastal city who fear the consequences of the city's ambitious plans for 
redeveloping parts of the old downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials are uncertain exactly how the face of the city will change 
over the coming years, they have targeted four parts of town for possible 
redevelopment: the Capistrano Beach "bowl" area (a mixture of small homes and 
family-run businesses below Interstate 5 near Doheny State Park), the so-called 
couplet area (a reference to the split of Coast Highway into two one-way 
streets) where Louise Cole lives, a crowded mix of apartments and homes called 
the Lantern district, and the bluffs area overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of ideas floating around now," said City Councilman 
Michael Eggers. "Some people are talking about a pedestrian mall in the couplet 
area. Some have suggested taking the couplet out and redoing Coast Highway. 
What we're doing is putting all the ideas out on the table and taking a look at 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents complain it is the uncertainty of the future that causes 
them fear, and they worry that redevelopment itself gives the city powers over 
their lives, homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives three people, a city council majority, the power over all that we 
have established here for so many years," said a downtown business owner who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The feelings are the same down in the Capistrano Beach bowl. At Lucy's El Patio 
Cafe on Doheny Park Road, owner Jack Saunderson is plain mad. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't like the idea that his family's 40-year-old business may be forced 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
"My place, it's home to me and my family," said Saunderson, 34, whose mother, 
Lucy, opened the restaurant in 1951 and still works there at age 75. "And now 
the city has the power to tell us we have to leave? We were here when all this 
was orange groves, way before the freeway went through." 
</P>
<P>
City officials readily admit that there are changes in store for certain parts 
of the six-square-mile town. Although Dana Point is a historic community that 
dates back to the 1880s, it is a young city, incorporated in January, 1989. It 
is in the process of writing its first general plan, often called the blueprint 
of a city. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the city has established the City Council as directors of a 
35-year, $241.5-million community redevelopment agency that gives them the 
power to enforce that general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment, officials say, is necessary if the city is to grow and thrive in 
the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William O. Talley said all the redevelopment agency will do is 
help finance what the general plan dictates. And that plan is being concocted 
with the help of the city residents through a series of community meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The general plan will reflect what the people want and that will direct the 
redevelopment effort," Talley said. "The community has to demand what we do, 
this is not something the city is doing on its own." 
</P>
<P>
But some people in town are not so sure the process has been that simple or 
democratic. Many, such as Cole and Saunderson, claim they were never told of 
any community meetings where they could voice their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't even heard about any meetings until one of my neighbors told me my 
restaurant was in the middle of a redevelopment area and I may be out of here," 
Saunderson said. "I took a survey that day of my customers and no one had 
received any letters from the city informing them of any meetings." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Karen Lloreda, who lives in Capistrano Beach, says she has 
urged her neighbors to take part in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still early and nothing has been finalized yet," said Lloreda, a 
first-year councilwoman who was elected through the support of many of the 
Capistrano Beach residents and business owners. "But people here need to get 
involved. There will be some changes made." 
</P>
<P>
At Serra Lumber in Capistrano Beach, adjacent to the railroad tracks, manager 
Russ Primrose does not like to hear talk of change. His business relies on a 
railroad spur that juts off the main line into his yard for deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business depends on the railroad as do other businesses in the area," 
Primrose said. "That's where we get 90% of our lumber. There's nowhere else 
between Fullerton and Oceanside that we could relocate." 
</P>
<P>
Talley admits that some people in these areas could be uprooted if their homes 
or businesses do not conform to the new land uses established in the new 
general plan. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things this city has to face is what is best for the long term, for 
the next 20 or 30 years," he said. "But this is based on reason and logic. We 
don't pick on people, that would be crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who owns a one-block section of Del Prado that her late husband bought 
for her retirement, may be one of those forced out. Her spotless apartment, 
which is part of a building she owns, sits in a downtown area that is being 
eyed as a commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of moving scares me to death," she said. "I moved here because 
this is where (she and her late husband) wanted to live out our years. I don't 
think this is fair." 
</P>
<P>
Saunderson shares her sentiments. Fair market value is not a term that sits 
well with Saunderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Fair market value? How do you put a value on a business that's been in the 
family for 40 years?" he asked.

STREET SMART: FREEWAY ON-RAMP SIGNALS ARE IMPERFECT BUT DO THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to see a minor change made to the signals at the metered on-ramps to 
freeways. Most of them operate from a loop in the pavement that modulates their 
operation during rush hour. Why not have the signal remain green instead of red 
if there is no one waiting in line at the ramp to go onto the freeway? 
</P>
<P>
An advantage would be that when traffic on the ramp is light -- and metering is 
less important -- the occasional vehicle would not need to stop, saving gas and 
wear and tear on the brakes associated with an unnecessary stop. 
</P>
<P>
W. Bruce Borden, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting idea and certainly seems appealing to those of us 
occasionally forced to stop at a ramp for no good reason. But there could be 
problems if more than one car were headed onto the ramp at once. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine three cars moving onto a metered ramp, each car closely following the 
next. The first one goes through the green meter light, triggering the red as 
it passes over the wire loop in the pavement. The second car sees the sudden 
red and slams on the brakes. The third car, following closely, does likewise, 
but plows into the second car. 
</P>
<P>
Instant bumper cars. Not a pretty scenario. 
</P>
<P>
With the red light glowing when no one is on the ramp, any approaching queue of 
cars knows from the start that drivers are going to have to slow to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly not a perfect system, but it does accomplish what Caltrans 
intended -- to ensure that cars are spewed onto the freeway one at a time, 
making it easier to merge into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I applaud the development of the car-pool lanes in Orange County, but there are 
a few bugs. 
</P>
<P>
One is the lack of an exiting area on the San Diego Freeway for the Euclid 
Street and Warner Avenue off-ramps. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
Also, the exit window for the Harbor Boulevard off-ramp gives the motorist less 
than a quarter-mile to cross several lanes of the freeway to get to the 
off-ramp. If the motorist is liable for a substantial fine for exiting the 
car-pool lane where it is not marked, Caltrans should evaluate the usefulness 
of the current markings. 
</P>
<P>
Linda A. Hagood, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes are imperfect creations at best. The prime goal, as Caltrans 
officials see it, is to create an expressway-type system that keeps car-pools 
moving without a lot of bother from other cars entering or exiting. With that 
in mind, designers try to keep to a minimum the entry and exit points, which 
are indicated by fat white lines know as "elephant track." 
</P>
<P>
With the multitude of on- and off-ramps in Orange County, it can be a difficult 
task. Designers are forced to shoehorn entry-exit areas into tight spots, or 
put them well in advance of a particular off-ramp they're supposed to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with Euclid Street and Warner Avenue. Headed north, the exit 
point for Euclid Street is actually a long entry-exit area that also serves 
Harbor Boulevard. For Warner Avenue, the exit area is further up the freeway, 
but about a mile before the off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
As I see it, the problem for many motorists is knowing when to leave a car-pool 
lane to reach the correct off-ramp. Along some car-pool lanes in Orange County, 
Caltrans has erected small green directional signs in the freeway median 
advising motorists when to exit. 
</P>
<P>
There are no such signs on the northern end of the San Diego Freeway's car-pool 
lane, which includes the Euclid and Warner off-ramps. Fortunately, Caltrans 
officials say they hope to install the directional signs by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Your problem with reaching the northbound Harbor Boulevard off-ramp is another 
matter. I went out to check the situation and found that the beginning of the 
exit window is about a half mile from the off-ramp. That doesn't give a 
motorist much room to cross traffic and get off the freeway, but it can be 
managed with a bit of fortitude. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said the elephant track doesn't appear any sooner because 
designers feared that it would be too close to the northbound transition road 
leading from the Corona del Mar Freeway. If the elephant track began nearer the 
transition road, they said, cars spewing off the Corona del Mar Freeway might 
try to zip too quickly across traffic to reach the car-pool lane, creating a 
safety hazard.

Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Why wouldn't one use the in speaking of our freeways! One takes the freeway, 
drives the freeway, or -- as do I -- hates the freeway, just as one might take 
the bus, ride the bus, or hate the bus. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
For those who just tuned in, a reader recently questioned why we Southern 
Californians use the when referring to freeways by their numbers -- as in the 
405 freeway or the 5. I had no particularly good answer but welcome theories 
from interested readers. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
This retired police chief commends you for the column of Oct. 4 about the use 
of a turn signal. 
</P>
<P>
Unsafe lane changing is one of the primary causes of accidents. In my opinion, 
traffic officers should be directed to issue citations to those who fail to 
signal prior to changing lanes or turning. 
</P>
<P>
Otto L. Bortfeld, Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for your letter. I welcome any reminder that I should make sure to look 
and signal before I change lanes.

SAN CLEMENTE GIRL, 13, RAPED WHILE AT HOME;

<P>
CRIME: POLICE BELIEVE HER ATTACKER MAY BE THE SAME MAN WHO KIDNAPED AND 
ASSAULTED A MENTALLY RETARDED WOMAN IN THE AREA LAST MONTH.

<P>
A 13-year-old girl was blindfolded, gagged and raped while home alone Saturday 
night, and police on Sunday were still searching for the rapist, who fled when 
the girl's mother returned home and interrupted the attack. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente police said Sunday that the sexual assault may be linked to the 
kidnaping of a woman about a month ago in the same area. Investigators have no 
suspects and only a vague description of the assailant, Sgt. Richard Downing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who lives in the Broadmore residential area in the hills above San 
Clemente High School, heard the doorbell ring about 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Downing 
said. As she approached the unlocked door, a man came in, immediately covered 
her eyes with his hands and forced her into another room. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker tied the girl's hands with material found in the house and 
blindfolded and gagged her before raping her, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
The man fled when the girl's mother returned home. "The mother did not see 
him," Downing said. "He ran out the front door when the mother came in, and she 
found her daughter tied up and gagged." 
</P>
<P>
The mother reported the attack at 8:39 p.m., prompting a search of the 
neighborhood around Avenida Presidio. San Clemente officers were aided by a 
Sheriff's Department helicopter and police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The only description police have of the attacker is that he is Caucasian, about 
20 years old, and had a few days' growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
"She reports that she did not know her attacker, and we don't have a suspect at 
this time," Downing said. "She did not get a good look at him. He put his hands 
right over her eyes, and then he blindfolded her." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified girl was not injured beyond the sexual assault and was not 
hospitalized, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first week of October, a 29-year-old mentally retarded woman was 
kidnaped near Avenida Pico by a man in a blue van and held for about eight 
hours. She was blindfolded and tied up, taken to an unknown apartment, stripped 
of her clothing and fondled, but she told police she was not raped, Downing 
said. She was released in the Dana Point area. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have few details about the incident because the victim has the 
mental capacity of a 10-year-old and is in a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is the same person who did this other one," Downing said. "It 
looks like it matches the description and MO." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they will step up patrols in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we can get more information on this, children that walk to school should 
walk in pairs," Downing said. "Children should be warned not to answer the door 
when they are left home alone. People need to keep doors locked and chained and 
know who's there before they answer it."

TRUCE DECLARED AT APARTMENT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and management at the Lincoln/Moody apartments have announced a truce 
less than a month after tenants publicly complained about conditions at the 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the council meeting last week, resident Brad Barnette said that 
owners of the property had solved all the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a moot issue at this point," Barnette said. "Everything has been 
taken care of. We are very pleased, especially with the maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 9, a group of tenants came to the City Council asking for help. They 
complained about unsafe stairways, lack of running water and cockroach 
infestations. 
</P>
<P>
The council investigated and gave the owner, California South West Management 
of Santa Monica, until Nov. 2 to address the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Yates, an attorney representing the owner, said he thought most of the 
cited conditions had been dealt with. "Maybe with the exception of the 
balconies," he said. Some residents' balconies had been propped up with wooden 
beams for added security. Yates said the balconies would not collapse, as 
residents had feared.

COUNTY WILL WAIVE PARK ENTRANCE FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city and the county have reached a joint-use agreement under which Brea 
will be able to utilize Craig Regional Park for youth and adult baseball, 
softball and soccer games without levying county vehicle entrance fees on 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Of the park's five baseball fields, three will be set aside for city use Monday 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining two fields will continue to be available for drop-in use on a 
first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Regional Park is off State College Boulevard south of Imperial Highway. 
It's partly in Brea and partly in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Hailing the agreement as "a sign of progress," County Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez, whose district includes both Brea and the park, said the arrangement 
will increase use of the regional facility. 
</P>
<P>
The unique agreement, the first between the county and a municipality, "will 
allow youth organizations to utilize Craig Park during the week, when the park 
is not getting maximum use," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The park's athletic facilities have been used mostly for informal pickup games 
and by groups of picnickers. The county's $2-per-vehicle entrance fee proved to 
be prohibitively high for some athletic leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The county's decision to waive the entrance fee, however, made the city-county 
agreement possible, said Leonard MacKain, a county parks commissioner and a 
Brea-Olinda Unified School District trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The city will issue passes to members of the leagues and install a device at 
the park's entrance that will allow pass-holders to enter the park without 
paying the entrance fee. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is expected to be approved by the City Council on Tuesday, 
will probably take effect in January. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

EDUCATORS HOPE FOR PROP. 146 APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South County school officials will be crossing their fingers on Election Day 
for the passage of Proposition 146, an $800-million bond measure, which would 
fund the construction of new schools in quickly developing areas such as Rancho 
Santa Margarita and Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Saddleback Valley and Capistrano Unified school districts are waiting 
for school construction funding from the state's "fast track" program, in which 
the state Department of Education and school districts each fund 50% of high 
priority schools. 
</P>
<P>
But while the districts have come up with their share through property taxes 
and developer fees, few state funds have been allocated. This has forced South 
County school officials to put projects on hold, redraw boundary lines, hold 
year-round classes and house students in portable classrooms or on other 
campuses until new schools can be built. 
</P>
<P>
But if voters approve Proposition 146, South County school districts could be 
eligible for millions in state funding to build up to 12 schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In Saddleback Valley, officials estimate they would receive $16 million to 
build three schools: an intermediate school in Rancho Santa Margarita and 
elementary schools in the Trabuco Highlands and Portola Hills areas. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified officials speculated that the bonds could contribute to the 
$160 million needed to build nine new schools currently on hold because of a 
lack of state funds. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the bond issue passes, South County could still be left in the cold 
if state education officials decide to give the money to other districts, said 
Jacqueline Cerra, Capistrano Unified spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no guarantee we would get money, we are in competition with 
a host of other school districts," Cerra said. "But if (Proposition 146) 
passes, it would better our chances for receiving state funding in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano officials estimate they will need to build 10 more schools by 1992 
to meet enrollment projections in Aliso Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Juan 
Capistrano, San Clemente, Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo. CHERYLANNE BEALER

MIKE PENNER: WITH ITS BACK TO THE WALL, DEFENSE RISES TO OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Robinson, head Ram pragmatist, looked at the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Rams 17, Oilers, 13. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the time left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
5:17. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Houston ball at the Oiler 39, first and 10. 
</P>
<P>
He had to look at things realistically. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined," Robinson said, "to make them score and give us enough time 
to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Say this about Robinson: The coach knows his defense. By way of reflex, 
Robinson was preparing himself for the worst, which, in this Ram season, is the 
only way to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I called timeout," Robinson continued, alluding to the stoppage of 
play with 2:30 left and Houston still in possession at the Ram 28. "If we were 
going to get the ball back, I wanted to have more than 47 seconds to work 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson harbored no delusions or grand illusions of oncoming defensive 
heroism. He was thinking victory -- and the quickest path, in his mind, was a 
quick strike by Warren Moon followed by one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Neither precedent nor Robinson's wildest imagination was prepared for the 
events that unfolded next. 
</P>
<P>
Moon drove the Oilers to the seven-yard line, to first-and-goal with 1:45 
remaining. After bucking Titanic odds by holding the Houston run-and-shoot to 
13 points over 58 minutes, the Rams were reeling. Their defense huddled in the 
end zone. The Oiler touchdown celebration was booked next. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, Moon handed the ball to running back Lorenzo White. A running 
play, designed to confuse a defense thinking pass all the way. 
</P>
<P>
But Doug Reed can read and the Ram defensive tackle saw White coming. Reed held 
his ground, lowered his shoulder and stopped White at the six. 
</P>
<P>
Second down. Moon wanted to get the ball to White again, but this time through 
the air. It wasn't worth the effort. Moon passed, White received and Ram 
linebacker Larry Kelm interceded, burying White at the five for another 
one-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
Third down. The clock was ticking away -- 1:07 left now -- but running a 
distant second behind the beat of Robinson's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Moon dropped back to pass and aimed a dart, in the end zone, for Ernest Givins' 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
Givins had Ram cornerback Bobby Humphery beaten. He had the football, too, but 
only for an instant. Moon struck Givins right in the top of the numbers, just 
below the collar, but the ball wouldn't oblige beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
Off Givins' shoulder pads it bounded, landing incomplete over the end line. 
Fourth down. Finally, fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
Moon took the snap, faded back and, for a moment, blue turned to red. Moon had 
become Steve Grogan, the New England Patriot quarterback who terrorized the 
Rams and their fans on the final play of the final game of the 1989 regular 
season. Do you remember? Can you ever forget? Grogan looked and looked and 
looked some more, scanning all of the New England seaboard, it seemed, before 
firing inches beyond the grasp of a touchdown-bound Hart Lee Dykes. 
</P>
<P>
Moon brought that sinking feeling back in a rush -- the petrifying dread, the 
impending nausea, the complete loss of all sense of time. 
</P>
<P>
"That play took about 85 seconds," Ram cornerback Darryl Henley swore. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that 'dead man's feeling?' " Reed said, his face slackening and his 
eyes bugging. "You're thinking, 'Oh, my God. Here we are again.' You're praying 
for someone, somewhere, to make a defensive play." 
</P>
<P>
In the upset of the season, someone on the Rams did. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Allen Pinkett was open at the goal line, near the left flag, waiting for 
the football. Moon got it there, but not before Humphery, so close to a goat 
the play before, came racing in from the end zone to bat the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just looking to do my job -- staying 'home' and play the zone that was 
called," Humphery said. "I'd already seen that Pinkett was wide open. I was 
looking to see whether Warren was going to throw or run -- that was the 
decision he had to make at that time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was fourth down. If I get there and knock it down, the game's over. So I 
got there." 
</P>
<P>
Right. With the Rams, it's always that easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd stop 'em all along," Robinson said with a grin and a wink, 
everything but a rim shot. Robinson, as pleasantly surprised as anyone in the 
stadium, was in a giddy mood. "Who knows?" he said. "Maybe we'll have a 
dominant defense." 
</P>
<P>
When not every reporter in the room laughed at this, Robinson decided to 
interpret. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
With the Rams' defense, you need every edge you can get, which is why Robinson 
and defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur decided to drop eight defenders into 
the end zone for Moon's final two passes. 
</P>
<P>
"There must have been 14 people in the end zone," Robinson said. "If you count 
the umpire and the back judge, there were 16 guys. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken some raps for playing this defense but in that situation, near the 
goal line, it's very difficult for a quarterback to find an opening. Warren's 
very good at hitting areas, but we were trying to take those areas away. We 
were hoping to distort him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shurmur: "There wasn't any place for him to go. We had eight guys there 
and he had only 15 yards of room. We filled up a lot of the spots he had to 
throw to." 
</P>
<P>
That's one flaw in the run-and-shoot. It tends to function better at long range 
than at point-blank. 
</P>
<P>
"They like to run that 'go,' " Reed said, "but when you get down there, there 
ain't no 'go.' All they can do is run a curl or spread it out. They need that 
space to run and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
This was one time it paid the Rams to have their backs to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
And if it wasn't exactly the linchpin to the season, the defensive stand of the 
year, it was, in Shurmur's words, "obviously, a critical series for us. I think 
it showed the guys have a lot of fight left in them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call it luck, but we battled right to the end and made the play." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, you had to call it exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to hang around us," Shurmur said with a weary smile, "you'd 
better not have a weak heart."

MOON DEFENDS RUN-AND-SHOOT SHOT DOWN BY RAMS

One touchdown, two field goals. Thirteen points. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Warren Moon stood tall after the Houston Oilers' 17-13 loss to the Rams 
Sunday, and said, "You can't blame the loss on the offense." 
</P>
<P>
What Moon meant was: Don't blame it on the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on the execution, not the system. The players, not the plan. 
</P>
<P>
It was the system that took the heat Sunday after the Oilers drove inside the 
Rams' 20 five times, only to come away with two field goals. Twice, Moon was 
intercepted and another pass was deflected by Bobby Humphery, sealing the Rams' 
victory with 47 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problems were physical," Moon said. "If a receiver slips or I don't make 
the throw, you can't shoot holes in the system because we can't score inside 
the 20." 
</P>
<P>
The only Oiler touchdown came on the first drive of the game, on Moon's 40-yard 
pass to Drew Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Moon entered Sunday's game first in the NFL in passing yardage, first in 
touchdown passes, first in attempts and first in completions. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the lasting impression was one of ineffectiveness. He threw for 343 yards, 
completing 26 of 43 passes. But he also threw two interceptions -- critical 
ones -- and the Oilers fell to 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Moon had been intercepted 11 times but only once in his last 156 attempts 
before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With the Oilers off next weekend, the memory of the latest miscues will be 
around a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me about it," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
The run-and-shoot works like a dream where there is field aplenty on which to 
operate, and Houston's receivers can spread the defense for Moon to pick apart. 
</P>
<P>
But what about when there is 20 yards of grass -- or less -- to deal with? And 
what about when eight guys drop back to defend? Then the run-and-shoot becomes 
something else: Run? Shoot! 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers can't seem to run the ball for a score, and they can't seem to throw 
it for one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to mention it, since everybody else has," said Ernest Givins, 
who with 1:07 to play allowed Moon's third-and-goal pass to hit off his 
shoulder pads incomplete at the back of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it, and I know it," Hill said. "Teams are dropping so many guys off 
in front of us, it makes it tough to throw down there." 
</P>
<P>
Moon tried, somewhat to his regret. There are passes he would like back. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple," Moon said. "The one to Curtis Duncan that Darryl Henley picked off, 
I'd like to have that one back." 
</P>
<P>
The one that Humphery stole in front of Haywood Jeffires in the end zone with 
6:30 left? 
</P>
<P>
"I know the one to Haywood, he did slip and fall," Moon said. "I thought that 
was a pretty good ball. What can you say? It's an interception. It goes down 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
And his last pass of the day, intended for Allen Pinkett and knocked away by 
Humphery? 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a great play to knock the ball away," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
And once again, the Oilers' offense -- system, quarterback and receivers -- 
fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks &amp; Shoes Dept.: Alvin Wright homed in on Moon on third and five with 
just over a minute to play. Moon scrambled away, just getting off the 
incomplete pass to Givins. But he didn't escape completely. After the play, 
Moon walked over to pick up his shoe and stocking. 
</P>
<P>
For the third week in a row, the Rams failed to get off a punt in a crucial 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
This time, punter Keith English had a fourth-quarter kick blocked by safety 
Bubba McDowell charging in from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers took over at the Ram 43-yard line, only to have Humphery intercept 
Moon's pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous two weeks, English chose not to kick the ball and risk a block 
after his protection broke down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different problems each time," Robinson said Sunday. "People are going to 
rush us now that they find we're a little bit panicked about it." 
</P>
<P>
English said he couldn't analyze what was going wrong until he saw the game 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"(The breakdowns) were different, and yet very much the same," English said. 
"We've just got a bunch of young guys out there. We're going to have to go look 
at the film and try to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
How do you explain the Rams' swing from horrible play to a good performance in 
a matter of one week? Don't ask Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a lot of teams that are struggling in that regard," he said. 
"But clearly we're the league leaders in that category." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur, defensive coordinator, on the difference between Houston's 
run-and-shoot attack and the conservative, run-oriented offense of the New York 
Giants, the Rams' opponents next week: "Today, we played volleyball. Next week, 
it will be three-tight end, blue-collar football."

U.S. VOLLEYBALL TEAM BEATS JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION: AMERICANS END LOSING SEASON ON HIGH NOTE AND INSIST 
TEAM WILL BE GREAT AGAIN.

<P>
By now, the U.S. men's volleyball team has become accustomed to the growing 
pains of grooming young players and rookie coaches for the rigors of 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Only two years after winning the Olympic gold medal, the United States has 
become a team in transition. 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, playing with a new coach and only one player from the 1988 team, 
swept Japan, 15-11, 15-8, 15-10, Sunday night at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
But change has been the operative word for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. program, circa 1982: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Americans finish 13th at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In an attempt to reconstruct the program, the U.S. Volleyball Assn. hires a 
new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Behind the play of Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons, the United States goes 
on to win every major international competition, including the 1984 and '88 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. program, circa 1990: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Americans finish a disappointing 13th at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Citing problems with the management of the U.S. Volleyball Assn., Coach 
Bill Neville resigns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kiraly and Timmons catch flights to Italy after signing six-figure 
contracts to play professionally there. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of big money overseas has forced the U.S. team to reconstruct its 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Fortune, a former standout a Laguna Beach High School and Stanford, is 
the only player left from the 1988 team. He says he's staying put -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune played a small role in the U.S. team's victory in 1988, but the 
6-foot-6 middle blocker and outside hitter is the team captain and leader. 
Fortune had 22 kills and Allen Allen had 30 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Americans a 2-2 record against Japan. The United States 
finished the 1990 season 23-38 and will break for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe how long this year has been," Fortune said. He and his 
teammates are caught in a merry-go-round of coaching changes. Neville, who took 
over for Marv Dunphy after the 1988 Olympics, quit in September. He said 
"months of frustration" led to his resignation, adding that the U.S. Volleyball 
Assn. wasn't giving the team enough direction and support. 
</P>
<P>
The team was quick to replace Neville, naming assistant Jim Coleman interim 
coach until January, when Stanford Coach Fred Sturm will take over. 
</P>
<P>
"We've run into some bumps where we don't have the money and the great 
players," Coleman said. "But I think we'll make a smooth transition . . . and 
have a good team." 
</P>
<P>
The latest situation is one U.S. volleyball fans are all too familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
The United States struggled in international volleyball when Kiraly and Timmons 
arrived in 1981. It wasn't until the 1984 Olympics that the United States 
established itself as an international power. Behind the play of Kiraly and 
Timmons, a former standout at Newport Harbor High School, the U.S. team 
dominated international competition for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the 1988 Olympics, the team began breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and Timmons left for the pro beach circuit in 1989, then for Italy in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Other starters on the 1988 team, Bob Ctvrtlik, Jeff Stork, Doug Partie and 
Craig Buck, also left for the Italian leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But several top players from the 1988 team, including Timmons, may return 
before the '92 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said the Americans have a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
"With a few more experienced players back, we should be good again," he said.

SONIC YOUTH FOCUSES ITS POWER, SOARS 
</P>

<P>
As a stage band, Sonic Youth has reached sonic maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The underground rock icons from New York City shaped and focused some of the 
most chaotic guitar sounds imaginable in a playful, authoritative and often 
exhilarating performance Saturday night at UC Irvine's Crawford Hall. 
</P>
<P>
On record, Sonic Youth regularly has achieved that sort of mastery at least 
since its 1986 album "Evol," which established the band as a leader of the 
alternative rock scene. In concert, though, the band's strengths were prone to 
be obscured by an overflowing surge of unharnessed sound. Now, its control and 
coordination seem complete. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of making over-the-edge but coherent rock music out of clangor and 
electronic overload goes back to the Velvet Underground in the mid-'60s (and 
Sonic Youth played against a backdrop of projected colors and shapes that 
recalled the "Exploding Plastic Inevitable" multimedia shows that Velvets' 
mentor Andy Warhol built around that band in its early days). 
</P>
<P>
Without copying the Velvets' sound, Sonic Youth provided a state-of-the-art 
embodiment of the rock-as-noise concept. Guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee 
Ranaldo used feedback howls, dissonances, twisted riffs based on unusual 
tunings and skewed playing techniques (a guitar doctored with duct tape for 
Ranaldo; a drumstick to scrape at or bang on strings for Moore at several 
junctures). These helped put the customary two-guitar blend on strange new 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dividing the guitar work into standard lead and rhythm roles, Sonic 
Youth was more concerned with spatial relationships. Moore usually played the 
foreground figures that were easiest for a listener to trace (drummer Steve 
Shelley often drove those riffs home by doubling the guitar cadences). Ranaldo, 
who chose from an array of about a dozen different guitars as if he were a 
golfer plucking the right club out of his bag, was the feedback master who 
wrapped his fellow guitarist's strands in a broad fabric of sound. 
</P>
<P>
This approach might sound a little measured and cerebral for a guitar-hero 
tradition that calls for grabbing the ax, turning its volume knob up to 10, and 
chopping away. But Sonic Youth was fun to watch. By the fourth song, for 
instance, Ranaldo had swung a 12-string guitar exactly like an ax, smashing it 
apart against the stage. Later, he held his guitar out to the audience as he 
shook groans from it, turning feedback into a sacrament. 
</P>
<P>
Vocals, divided mainly between Moore and his wife, bassist Kim Gordon, were 
designed to serve more as added instrumental lines rather than as a 
conventional medium for pop melody. Moore had a bit of Tom Verlaine's yelp in 
his delivery, while Gordon's incantational singing was hoarser, more biting 
than on record. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything Sonic Youth played during its 70-minute set was taken at 
a hurtling, swarming pace, although less hectic eddys appeared at times, 
temporarily slowing the insistent, fast current. This method didn't change much 
from song to song but once the band began clicking with its third selection, 
"Cinderella's Big Score," unswerving intensity made up for the lack of variety. 
</P>
<P>
It was a show that needed no additions (although the band's songbook easily 
could support a longer set without losing quality). But as Sonic Youth gets 
ready for its 10th year as a band, it still is working under a limitation that 
besets most '80s bands: excessive specialization. Sonic Youth has found a good 
niche for itself and has burrowed deeply into it, refining and amplifying the 
same approach with each album. The best rockers of the '60s and '70s were far 
more protean. 
</P>
<P>
The Velvet Underground, for example, played some of pop's most tender ballads 
-- "I'll Be Your Mirror," "Sunday Morning" -- when it wasn't going on the noisy 
anti-pop excursions of a "Sister Ray." Sonic Youth's repertoire includes 
celebrations of rock's power, odes to transcending the everyday grind, songs of 
spooky irony and pieces devoted to dark humor or black dread. But it hasn't 
shown a hint of tenderness and warmth. Perhaps its method doesn't allow it. But 
perhaps it would be worth finding new methods to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Mudhoney didn't escape the trap that Sonic Youth bounded over 
with the sheer force of its playing -- sameness leading to tedium. 
</P>
<P>
The young Seattle band proved that it could hammer home '60s garage rock riffs 
culled from as far back as the Kinks' "You Really Got Me," along with some more 
recent-vintage punk thrashing. Everything about Mudhoney, including singer Mark 
Arm's leathery howling, was raw and hard. That's promising, but the band needs 
to develop more involving, less repetitious material. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Matt Lukin made the biggest impression -- not for any musical efforts 
but for his foolish babblings between songs. 
</P>
<P>
Lukin was back at it during Sonic Youth's final encore, when members of 
Mudhoney and opening band Gumball joined in for a version of the Stooges' "I 
Wanna Be Your Dog." Lukin's contribution to the sloppy but fun number was to 
drop his trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Gumball was restrained but reasonably effective in a brief opening set that 
dredged up tougher '60s sources ranging from the Stooges to Jimi Hendrix to 
Neil Young. The proceedings could have used some of the humor and verve that 
come through on "Rake," the latest album by Velvet Monkeys, a band in which two 
members of Gumball used to play.

Classical East Indian dancer Ramya Harishankar of Irvine has applied for a 
listing on the Touring Artists Directory of the California Arts Council. The 
council will reimburse performing arts organizations in the state that present 
artists on the roster in the 1992-93 and 1993-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Harishankar, director of the Arpana Dance Company, would tour as a soloist. She 
was the only Orange County artist to apply for the support. Last year, none 
did. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of the American Institute of Architects has elected 
Dan Heinfeld of Irvine as president, succeeding Dell H. DeRevere of Newport 
Beach. Roberta W. Jorgensen of Mission Viejo is the new vice 
president/president-elect, and Howard L. Gilpin of Costa Mesa is the new chief 
financial officer.

LONDON ORCHESTRA DEBUTS IN SOUTHLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society had the good fortune to host the 
Southland debut Saturday of the hugely successful, controversial London 
Classical Players under conductor Roger Norrington. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington &amp; Co. are part of a movement dedicated to respecting long-dead 
composers' presumed intentions by scraping obfuscating interpretive overlay 
from their scores. 
</P>
<P>
With this particular ensemble, there is a difference: Its hackle-raising 
specialty is taking popular 19th-Century repertory -- on Saturday by Beethoven, 
Schubert and Mendelssohn -- rather than the relative esoterica of the Baroque 
and Classical eras and subjecting it to thorough cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
Apparent in the welcoming acoustics of the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
was that the Classical Players' sound is less alien live than on recordings. 
Such on-disc elements as the overbearing shotgun blasts of the old timpani, 
played with hard sticks, retain their impact in the hall but are better 
integrated with the ensemble, while the gut strings sound less pinched, more 
sweetly plaintive and the brass less raucous. 
</P>
<P>
Balances are just, but instrumental choirs retain their individual timbres and 
the light-toned solo winds sound clearly in Norrington's well-thought-out 
seating arrangement: horns and trumpets (valve-less, of course) on opposite 
edges of the stage, basses divided in half over a similar span, winds at top 
center, first violins to his left, seconds to his right. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of orchestral detail heard in Mendelssohn's once-familiar-in-concert 
and, as was proven Saturday, still-ravishing "Scottish" Symphony was startling. 
Here, too, Norrington blasted the canard that he is a compulsive speedster. The 
slow movement sang gently, elegantly, the vibrato-less strings' quick attack 
and release maintaining the lyric line where usually their sound hangs 
endlessly in the air, obscuring pitch and impeding momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Other memorable ingredients in the Mendelssohn: Lisa Beznosiuk's firm and 
gentle flute solos, Colin Lawson's piercing, bucolic clarinet, and the assured 
blatting of the horns in the spectacular crescendo that Norrington -- and 
Mendelssohn -- built for the gathering-of-the-clans finale. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Norrington and his crew fleetly dispatched Schubert's Fourth Symphony 
("Tragic"), attentive not to the Romantic images conjured up by the nickname or 
imagined Beethoven associations, but rather to the outer movements' ancestry in 
Sturm und Drang Haydn. 
</P>
<P>
To these ears, the program-opening "Egmont" Overture of Beethoven sounded too 
determinedly un-monumental, as if to deny Beethoven any connection with 
Romanticism. However, the encore, Beethoven's dashing "Prometheus" Overture, 
was a rollicking, spirited delight.

Nobody won the $4.8-million jackpot in the latest "Lotto 6-53" game, and 
lottery officials said today that Wednesday's prize could reach $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Because no player picked all six numbers, the $4.8-million prize will roll over 
to Wednesday night's drawing. Lottery officials expected that six-of-six 
jackpot to reach $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
There were five tickets with five numbers plus the bonus number that won 
$110,611 apiece. The tickets were purchased in Burbank, Hawthorne, Los Angeles 
and two in Daly City.

MT. ST. HELENS EXPLODES WITH ASH PLUME; NO DAMAGE SEEN

<P>
Mt. St. Helens exploded early this morning, sending a plume of ash 30,000 feet 
into the air, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion was recorded on volcano seismographs at 2:07 a.m., said Chris 
Jonientz-Trisler, a research scientist at the University of Washington's 
seismology laboratory in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of damage and residents of neighboring towns were not in 
any danger, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jonientz-Trisler said the explosion was "very minor, minor, minor" compared to 
the May 18, 1980, eruption that leveled 230 square miles, left 57 people dead 
or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an eruption, an explosion does not spew lava. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing is more like the steam and ash explosions that occurred 
last winter in December and January," Jonientz-Trisler said. Pilots spotted ash 
30,000 feet in the air this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Winds were carrying the ash plume to the southeast, toward the Columbia River 
and into Oregon, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion also apparently knocked out two seismic monitoring stations north 
of the lava dome that had been built on the crater floor. 
</P>
<P>
The volcano's last significantly large eruption was on March 19, 1982, when mud 
flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork of the Toutle River. 
</P>
<P>
The cataclysmic May, 1980, eruption blew off the top 1,300 feet of the 
once-symmetrical peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th Century.

Youths wrecked stores and stoned riot police today as more than 100,000 high 
school students nationwide joined marches demanding more teachers, better 
facilities and improved security on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said most of the marchers in more than a dozen cities were orderly. 
</P>
<P>
But scores of youths threw stones and bottles at riot police deployed near the 
National Assembly building in Paris, where lawmakers opened debate on the 1991 
education budget. 
</P>
<P>
At least five police officers and eight journalists were injured by 
projectiles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to the bombardment by pushing back some of the youths with 
clubs, but they generally avoided confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
March organizers urged the protesters to remain peaceful and blamed the 
violence on provocateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of protesters in Paris ranged from 20,000 to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Youths damaged several stores, telephone booths and newsstands during a rampage 
that lasted about an hour. Some students were seen trying to limit the damage 
by passing potential projectiles to police officers deployed behind barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Pierre Verbrugghe said an unspecified number of youths were 
arrested for looting a store along the march route. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some youths had chanted slogans comparing the riot squads with Nazi 
Germany's SS forces. 
</P>
<P>
Other marches involving at least 3,000 students each were reported in Lyon, 
Grenoble, Toulouse, Rennes, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Strasbourg, Lille, Lens, 
Nancy, Marseille and Bordeaux. At least two cars were damaged in Lyon, where an 
estimated 6,000 students marched.

BUSINESSMAN WEINBERG DIES, LEAVES $900 MILLION FOR CHARITY

Harry Weinberg, a reclusive millionaire who made a fortune in Baltimore and 
Hawaii, has died at age 82, leaving a $900-million charitable trust, one of the 
biggest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg died Sunday at the Queen's Medical Center after an eight-year battle 
with bone cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Forbes magazine estimated Weinberg's worth at $950 million, ranking 
him 70th on its list of the 400 richest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
His family immigrated to Baltimore in 1912 from what was the Austro-Hungarian 
empire. Weinberg quit school at 12, worked in his father's auto shop, sold 
newspapers on the side and eventually parlayed a series of remarkably 
successful business deals into enormous wealth. 
</P>
<P>
He began acquiring land during the Depression, buying 47 properties in downtown 
Baltimore alone. 
</P>
<P>
A millionaire by the end of World War II, Weinberg began buying money-losing 
private transit companies in Baltimore, Scranton, Pa., Dallas, New York and 
Honolulu. He later sold them at enormous profit. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Honolulu in the early 1950s, he recognized that jet travel would 
make Hawaii's tropical islands accessible to middle-class tourists. 
</P>
<P>
He acquired Oahu and Maui properties that form the bulk of the estate and are 
now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in one of the nation's hottest real 
estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg moved from Baltimore to Honolulu in 1968, but had already set up a 
Baltimore-based foundation for the poor that bears his name and that of his 
wife, who died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation -- which will receive most of his 
estate -- will be among the nation's 12 largest, worth at least $900 million 
and obligated to spend as much as $45 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg left nothing to his son, Morton, according to Shale Stiller, attorney 
for the foundation.

'STILL IGNORANT' ON IRAN-CONTRA, REAGAN INSISTS

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan acknowledges that the Iran-Contra affair hurt 
his effectiveness in the last two years of his term, but he defends his actions 
in his new memoir. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also says he is "still ignorant" about all the facts in the scheme in 
which weapons were sold to Iran and the profits diverted to the Nicaraguan 
Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "An American Life," Reagan said that if he could relive the past, 
he would bring former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and his 
then-aide, Oliver L. North, to the Oval Office to explain the Iran-Contra 
affair to him. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts of the book, made available Sunday, appear in this week's issue of 
Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
" 'OK John and Ollie, level with me,' " Reagan wrote about what he would say. " 
'Tell me what really happened and what it is that you have been hiding from me. 
Tell me everything.' 
</P>
<P>
"If I had done that, at least I wouldn't be sitting here, writing this book, 
still ignorant of some of the things that went on during the Iran-Contra 
affair," he wrote. Poindexter and North were most involved in the diversion. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan insisted that the sale of weapons to Iran was not intended to swap arms 
for American hostages held in Lebanon. "But I know it may not look that way to 
some people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he was hurt by the scandal, the most serious of his eight-year 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The cloud that descended over my credibility during Iran-Contra undoubtedly 
affected my last two years in office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said his greatest regret as President was sending Marines to Lebanon, 
where a suicide bomber attacked the Marine barracks in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983, 
killing 241 servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he had believed that it was a good idea to deploy Marines in 
war-torn Lebanon as peacekeepers. But he said American officials did not 
realize how vulnerable the servicemen were in the barracks on a wide-open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, sending the Marines to Beirut was the source of my greatest 
regret and greatest sorrow," Reagan wrote.

Military curfews confined 150,000 Palestinians to their homes in the occupied 
Gaza Strip today following two days of rioting in which at least 185 
Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 350 Gaza residents were treated for lesser injuries from rubber 
bullets, beatings and tear-gas inhalation, according to the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency, which oversees Palestinian aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman's office said eight areas in Gaza were under curfew today, 
including the village of Beit Hanoun, where clashes began Saturday and spread 
throughout Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters and photographers without military escort were barred from the 
seaside strip, where more than 700,000 Palestinians live.

Police arrested 150 people for spreading rumors that sorcerers have been 
stealing men's genitals -- rumors that led to at least three deaths, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner James Danbaba announced the arrests after rumors 
about the purported thefts swept the West African capital. 
</P>
<P>
Mobs killed at least three people accused of stealing the organs. One 
policewoman who rushed to the aid of an alleged sorcerer was beaten by the 
crowd and remained in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rumors, the alleged sorcerers approached strangers and asked 
them for directions. Later, the victims reportedly said their genitals were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
Police dismissed the reports after investigators examined the supposed victims, 
Danbaba said.

Airbus Industrie today said it expects to report its first operating profit 
this year due to more aircraft orders and efforts to cut production costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in orders is, in turn, a consequence of the consortium's recently 
completed aircraft family . . . as well as of the continued buoyant market for 
airliner sales," the consortium of four European aircraft companies said in its 
monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
It put no figure on the profit. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus said the profit will be shared among its four partners -- France's 
Aerospatiale and West Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, which each have a 
38% stake, British Aerospace PLC with 20% and CASA of Spain with 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus said it won firm orders for 254 aircraft during the first nine months of 
the year, down from 310 in the first three quarters of 1989.

<P>
Wall Street stocks followed through on last week's rally today, closing with 
moderate gains that were pushed up by a sharp fall in oil prices and solid 
gains in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.39 to 2,502.23 on top of last 
week's 54.70-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,027 up, 543 down and 424 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 147.51 million shares, against 168.70 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices tumbled today, pushed down on signs that inventories remain high 
despite the Persian Gulf crisis. The December crude oil contract on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange was off $2.04 at $31.96 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the market has also drawn support lately from expectations of a 
drop in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
With evidence mounting of weakness in business activity, many observers say, 
the Federal Reserve is getting more and more leeway to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters hope cheaper money will alleviate the credit problems that have 
been unsettling the banking industry and the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
The depressed bank stocks, which began an upswing late last week, posted 
further gains today. Manufacturers Hanover rose 7/8 to 18 1/2; BankAmerica 1 
1/8 to 21 1/2, and J.P. Morgan 1 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
Among other prominent financial issues, Federal Home Loan Mortgage gained 1 3/8 
to 37 5/8 and Federal National Mortgage was up 5/8 at 29 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices moved moderately higher in light early trading today as many market 
players stayed on the sidelines, waiting to see whether the Federal Reserve 
would nudge interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield, which falls as the bond's price rises, slipped to 8.67% 
from 8.70% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds also were supported by a decline in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
But trading was very light as many bond investors decided to wait and see if 
the Fed would relax its credit policy and allow interest rates to fall, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, many traders were waiting to see the October producer price 
report from the Labor Department on Friday. If the report shows an acceleration 
of inflation, the Fed would have less leeway in lowering rates. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was also waiting to see how much demand there is for 
bonds in the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction this week. The government 
is selling three-year notes Tuesday, 10-year issues on Wednesday and 30-year 
bonds on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were 1/16 
point to 5/32 point higher, intermediate maturities ranged from 7/32 point to 
1/4 point higher and long-term issues rose 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported.

The National Party government today announced it will bail out the country's 
biggest bank as part of a triple economic bombshell that sent financial markets 
into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Just three days after taking office, Prime Minister Jim Bolger unveiled plans 
for the $380-million rescue of the Bank of New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the budget will have to be rewritten and that the government will 
have to borrow an extra $740 million. 
</P>
<P>
The truth had to be told on the economy, however shocking, he said at a news 
conference. "The only way we are going to get confidence back into New Zealand 
is for people to have figures they can believe and trust." 
</P>
<P>
Bolger has accused the Labor government, swept from power in the Oct. 27 
general election, of hiding the depth of New Zealand's economic problems.

12. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing had originally been scheduled for Oct. 1, but Wood decided to 
hold a pre-sentencing hearing to help her determine how stiff a sentence Milken 
should get. That hearing lasted about two weeks.

Intel Corp. today unveiled computer chips it says will make it much cheaper for 
video technology to be built into personal computers, allowing the desktop 
machines to edit and store moving images much as they do text. 
</P>
<P>
While similar technology already exists, it is expensive -- a video system 
offered by IBM and Intel costs about $2,000 above the price of a regular 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
Intel says its new chips should allow computer companies to add video 
capability to personal computers for half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The computer-chip maker says its technology should spur the young market for 
so-called multimedia, or the marriage of television and computing. Multimedia 
allows the text and interactive capabilities of computers to be mixed with 
video, stereo sound, still photographs and animation.

Negotiators today reached a settlement ending a strike by 8,000 Navistar 
International Corp. employees in six states. 
</P>
<P>
Navistar spokesman Bill Greenhill said the employees who walked out at midnight 
Friday after a contract extension ran out would begin returning today.

Navistar, formerly International Harvester, makes trucks and diesel engines.

The tentative agreement was reached about 3 a.m. after 19 hours of talks

</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement were withheld pending a meeting of the union 
bargaining committee on Wednesday, but Bill Casstevens, UAW secretary-treasurer 
and chief negotiator, said the pact "meets the membership's needs for continued 
job and income security while making important improvements in economic areas." 
</P>
<P>
UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said a ratification vote could begin this week. 
Workers in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, Maryland and Texas were affected

A 33-year-old man was killed and his wife injured when their car left a curving

Irvine resident Ioannis (John) Doukas, was pronounced dead at Western Medical

The cause of death was listed as severe body trauma. He was not wearing a seat 
belt.

His wife, Debbie Doukas, 31, who was wearing a seat belt, was in stable

Bowman said Ioannis Doukas was driving his Chrysler New Yorker around a curve 
on Stonecreek North at the intersection of Willowbrook when he apparently lost 
control of the vehicle, which went over the sidewalk and struck a tree and 
stone fencepost in front of a nearby residence. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were at the scene this morning in the residential village of 
Woodbridge to determine the estimated speed of the vehicle and how it careened 
out of control.

A powerful homemade bomb exploded outside a Van Nuys liquor store late Sunday 
night, hurling shrapnel that shattered windows and damaged a parked car, Los 
Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb had been placed on top of a pay telephone outside Adam's Liquor in a 
mini-mall at 14556 Vanowen St. and blew up about 11:30 p.m., Detective Don 
Tabak said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast blew out most of the windows of the liquor store, a restaurant and a 
video store, Tabak said. The damaged car was parked in the mini-mall parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
The stores were closed, and there were no injuries. A clerk at Adam's Liquor 
said that the inside of the store escaped damage and that all the businesses in 
the mini-mall are open today. 
</P>
<P>
Police had no motive or suspects in the bombing.

Top U.S. trade negotiator Carla Anderson Hills, hoping to revive stalled 
negotiations on freeing world trade, arrived today in Geneva, where a group of 
major farm exporting nations accused the European Community of endangering the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said at Geneva airport that the EC's repeated failure to agree on 
proposals for farm subsidy cuts is tainting the entire 105-nation Uruguay Round 
of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks is to open markets for everything 
from textiles to spices, and generally set the stage for international commerce 
into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Hills appealed to European Community ministers meeting in Brussels today to 
agree -- during their seventh attempt -- on proposals for reforming farm trade. 
</P>
<P>
As Hills spoke, ministers of the Cairns Group of advanced and developing farm 
exporting countries debated how to press the EC into coming forward with a 
feasible plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the start of a one-day ministerial meeting, the Cairns Group 
said failure by Brussels to meet an Oct. 15 deadline has put at risk the entire 
package of negotiations.

George Foreman seems headed for the seashore for his bid to make boxing

SANTA CLARA VOTERS WARY OF STADIUM CAMPAIGN

SANTA CLARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After striking out twice in San Francisco, Giants owner Bob Lurie is pitching 
to voters in Santa Clara County a plan for a sleek new baseball stadium. But 
many here say the millionaire is throwing them a curve. 
</P>
<P>
With a day left before the election, polls show Silicon Valley voters 
overwhelmingly rejecting the stadium, casting further doubt on where the Giants 
will play ball in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to win the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of voters here has been 
filled with twists that underscore how politics are different in this valley of 
silicon chips and computer whiz kids. 
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley's corporate titans staunchly oppose the stadium, and outgoing 
San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery, a popular political force for the last eight years, 
also refuses to stump for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in San Francisco, when voters turned down similar measures in 1987 
and 1989, big business had heavily endorsed the stadium issue and then-Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein and current Mayor Art Agnos had barnstormed nonstop for weeks 
drumming up support. 
</P>
<P>
But talk of recession and the fact that county residents would foot much of the 
stadium's bill has turned the issue into a David vs. Goliath match. 
</P>
<P>
"I love baseball," said Lorne Smyth, founder of CATS, an acronym for Committee 
Against The Stadium. "But when Will Clark gets a salary of $4 million a year, 
and when I'm asked to pay for a place where he can play, there's something 
wrong there. Hey, I'm no sucker." 
</P>
<P>
The stadium measure requires voters to tax themselves an extra 1% on their gas, 
electric, water, sewer, garbage, telephone and cable television bills. 
</P>
<P>
An average family's utility bill would be raised by $15 a year, with the 
increased taxes pulling in $15 million annually, say ballpark proponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The utility tax is perceived as a tax on a necessity for a luxury," conceded 
Rick DiNapoli, a principal backer of the plan who acknowledged that the 
measures will have a difficult time passing. 
</P>
<P>
As of last Thursday, the ballpark measures were losing by a 25-percentage-point 
margin, according to a San Jose Mercury News poll. 
</P>
<P>
The projected $152-million, 45,000-seat stadium would be on a 148-acre site, 
one mile north of the Great America Theme Park, near California 237 and U.S. 
101. The Santa Clara city venue is now wetlands and a former landfill. 
</P>
<P>
To pass, the complicated plan requires voters in five cities to approve 
ballpark issues in four separate measures. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote is critical. After losing the two ballpark measures to San 
Francisco voters, Lurie has vowed that he will either sell the team or move to 
another location if Santa Clara voters turn the issue down. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply will not go back to the voters again," Giants Vice President Corey 
Busch said in an interview. "And there's no way we can continue at 
Candlestick."

PLACIDO DOMINGO'S SCHEDULE SETS THE TONE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
A week after his 2,200th performance opened the Metropolitan Opera's fall 
season, Placido Domingo has no intention of cutting back from the hectic 
schedule for which he is famous. 
</P>
<P>
"I do rest a lot more than people think," the tenor said, squeezing in an 
interview during a short break at a recording studio. "I continue at the right 
pace; I pace myself well." 
</P>
<P>
The right pace for Domingo would kill many a lesser mortal. He averages 90 
performances a year, in addition to recording albums (he has more than 70) and 
serving as an artistic consultant to the Los Angeles Opera and the 1992 
Universal Exposition in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he talked, aides interrupted him with questions, while photographers 
who had planned on just a few minutes more to shoot his picture for an album 
cover bemoaned the loss of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him I have my hands full now," the singer told an assistant who asked if 
he would speak the next day with ABC-TV anchorman Peter Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have interviews, or extra work, ahh," Domingo shrugged, somewhat 
sheepishly. "The singing is not so hard as all the extra things that come 
along." 
</P>
<P>
But ask him how he plays Rodolfo in "La Boheme," or what it's like making his 
first album with Itzhak Perlman, or about his role as artistic consultant for 
Expo 92 in Seville. Then the strain of being one of opera's most prolific stars 
melts away in the sheer joy of talking about opera, music and Domingo's native 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The opening night performance was his 120th portrayal of Rodolfo, the brash 
young poet. Still, the tenor says he enjoys the role, relishing its blend of 
comedy and tragedy, and the chance to don Rodolfo's bohemian mantle of youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very good to have an element of comedy," he says, noting that most roles 
for his vocal range lean toward tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the recording studio, where Domingo joked as he and Perlman 
posed for pictures, was certainly the right one. The as-yet unnamed album, 
under the Angel/EMI label, will feature pieces made famous by the Irish tenor 
John McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo says some of his finest work, however, has come from behind the 
floodlights, instead of in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five years of great results. Opera is happening in Los Angeles," he 
declared, not without pride. "We do all kinds of repertoire. We have created a 
fantastic company that didn't exist five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
At Expo '92, one of the main cultural highlights will be the production of 
every opera set in Seville -- seven total, including "Carmen," "The Marriage of 
Figaro," "The Barber of Seville" and "Don Giovanni." 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans are quite spectacular," he said, reeling off the names of opera 
companies scheduled to perform in Seville: the Met, Milan, Florence, Dresden, 
Stockholm, Vienna, maybe Los Angeles or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't stop there. Symphony orchestras are expected from London, Vienna, 
Leningrad, Israel and Pittsburgh, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
The Maestranza Theater, where many of the productions will be held, is under 
construction but plans to open in the spring, a year before Expo '92 begins. 
Domingo, a native of Madrid, says he will perform in Seville, but waved off 
further questions with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish tenor, well aware of frailties of the human body, guards his 
instrument by not talking at all on the day of a performance. He bends the rule 
somewhat on recording days. 
</P>
<P>
"Recording, you can redo. You never do things the first time," he said. "In the 
theater no one is going to help you. You have to do it from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of turning 50 in January doesn't faze him in the least. "It's 
wonderful to arrive at 50. I am working with more energy than ever."

estimated to be worth up to $1 million -- found at the apartment in Brooklyn, 
said Sgt. Norris Holloman, a police spokesman.

Police didn't know if the others had also been stolen.

The Utrillo painting, "Rue a Montmartre," a 1926 work showing a Paris street,

TASTE OF SUCCESS LEAVES SINGER WANTING MORE

<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Taylor Dayne knows exactly what she wants from success: She wants more. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, she is already fairly familiar with life at the top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
Her first album, "Tell It To My Heart," was a certified smash, while its 
follow-up, "Can't Fight Fate," remains on the charts a year after its release. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Dayne can't help wondering how to improve on that track record. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't greed that drives her. "It's a competitive edge; it's a hunger," she 
said. "That's what keeps me awake at night. It's not having the billion dollars 
in the bank or all that. I feel like I have something to say." 
</P>
<P>
Before Dayne hooked up with Ric Wake, her producer and songwriting partner, she 
"was doing a lot of rock stuff, was in a lot of rock groups in the (New York) 
area and just wasn't cutting it." 
</P>
<P>
So she and Wake tried another approach, putting together their own production 
company to make dance singles. "We were looking for the right vehicle, and that 
song was 'Tell It to My Heart,' which we found through a publishing company. I 
said, 'Look, let's not do it light. Let's go for it. Let's combine the rock 
with hip-hop.' " 
</P>
<P>
What followed was beyond their wildest dreams. "All I was expecting was to get 
paid back the $5,000 that we invested in producing it, plus a little on top of 
that. And hopefully get signed by a major." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she wound up with a smash hit and a deal with Arista records.

"I'd made my own diagnosis of Alzheimer's. I'm a news junkie, and I read a lot

"In 1986 I told Mary Lou that I thought she might have Alzheimer's. I hope I

LIZ SMITH: NANCY REAGAN BIOGRAPHY 'SO HOT, SO WIRED, SO SECRET'

THE SIZZLE in publishing is all about Kitty Kelley's upcoming biography of 
Nancy Reagan. Word of mouth by the very few who have read the manuscript is 
fantastic. ICM is the agent-traffic cop keeping this big one under wraps. It 
will be published next spring. The work is being edited at Simon &amp; 
Schuster, and lawyers are vetting it. There is more interest in Nancy's life by 
Kitty than in all the writer's previous tell-alls on Jackie, Liz and Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
People who have read the Reagan book comment that it is "up close and 
personal," so unauthorized a view, "so hot, so wired, so secret," that it will 
knock our socks off. Kitty's editor, the respected Alice Mayhew, will only say, 
"Look, this is a real biography in the classic sense of a writer trying to 
understand another complicated human being." 
</P>
<P>
Kitty, still living in Washington, won't talk. I used to be one of her favorite 
people but not anymore. (Sigh.) 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK columnist/gadfly Michael J. Thomas opined last week that he thinks the 
late William S. Paley would have relished his new biography by Sally Bedell 
Smith, titled "In All His Glory." Well, I doubt it. Paley wanted to keep his 
image shined up, just as most of the rest of us do. The network he created, 
CBS, tried to do its part with its memorial to Paley last week, and Dan Rather 
was relaxed and at his best along with Walter Cronkite, Don Hewitt, Audrey 
Meadows, George Burns, Danny Thomas, Norman Lear, Mike Dann and Fred Silverman.

What this show did was remind us of what Paley wrought -- the genius comics he 
built up (Jack Benny, Burns &amp; Allen, Gleason, Skelton, Lucy, Thomas etc.), 
the daring shows ("All In The Family," for instance), the great stars (Judy 
Garland, Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore). And his way with the news.

It's certainly OK to read Smith's book. You can't put the darned thing down. 
But the author is hard on Paley, and sometimes it seems as if the book forgets 
that he did create CBS and endowed it with taste and intelligence of a high 
order and with ethical news coverage. Smith is a little overboard on Paley's 
womanizing and social climbing. And while I do think those things were a part 
of Bill Paley, let me just repeat what one intimate of Paley's said recently: 
"She criticizes Bill for wanting to pal around with the likes of Jock Whitney. 
Well, who wouldn't have wanted to pal around with the likes of Jock Whitney?"
