LOS ANGELES RIVER AND MASS TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on Katz's trip down the Los Angeles River in a Chevy Blazer made 
me realize something. 
</P>
<P>
He's right about using the river for the commuting. But he's wrong about the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The river should have dams and locks so commuter boats (like the tour boats on 
Holland's canals) can shuttle people back and forth to Los Angeles.

FEEDING HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Group Defies Order to Stop Feeding Poor," Metro, Nov. 2: 
</P>
<P>
I live across the street from Plummer Park in West Hollywood where the homeless 
are being fed. The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition gives away food -- 
that's good. They have also been giving away the safety, security and decency 
of my neighborhood -- that's not even a little good. 
</P>
<P>
The park has become a cesspool -- it simply stinks of excrement. The public 
restrooms are unusable by ordinary folk but not by the junkies shooting up in 
there -- go see, they don't stop just because people come in. The neighborhood 
is becoming a cesspool: The homeless defecate on our lawns, they sleep in our 
garages and break into our cars and apartments. One of the homeless set a fire 
in the garage behind my building, burning it down along with my car. 
</P>
<P>
I am furious that our city council permitted this program to begin without 
taking steps in advance to protect us. The construction of the new civic center 
in West Hollywood Park will just send more of the homeless to Plummer. We have 
placed Proposition B on Tuesday's ballot to prevent this. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrities who served up the food to the homeless get no honor from being 
charitable with our safety and our neighborhood.

MENTAL TRAUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have been told of those people, including many who became homeless, who 
suffered mental trauma from the recent hurricane on the East Coast and the 
earthquake in the Bay Area. Mental health professionals and the media have made 
an effort to inform the public about the trauma and how it is treated. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is as it should be. But what about the homeless who end up on 
the streets for other reasons? They, too, suffer mental trauma when they become 
homeless, but this is ignored. The trauma, plus the stress the homeless 
continue to experience, appears to destroy initiative in many and the ability 
to cope. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it cruel to say that "those people don't want to work"? And can't their 
trauma-induced suffering be acknowledged and treated in an enlightened and 
humane manner?

LOS ANGELES RIVER AND MASS TRANSIT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Katz Tries Going With L.A. River's Flow," by Bella Stumbo, Part 
A, Oct. 15: 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) should be commended for trying to be 
creative in thinking up solutions to Los Angeles freeway congestion. However, 
the last thing the people of Los Angeles need is to lose some of the little 
open space they have left for a freeway where there once was a river. There are 
still stretches of the Los Angeles River which act as a river should and 
provide a haven for birds, top soil for shrubs, and in times of heavy rainfall 
rapid waters. There are equestrian trails for horseback enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
People who live in neighborhoods which abut the Los Angeles River and who are 
already plagued by monstrous street traffic would be expected to endure an even 
greater traffic nightmare by having their surface roads overloaded 
back-to-back, acting as vehicular arteries to the Los Angeles River Freeway. 
Also, in view of the damage done in the recent Bay Area earthquake, the safety 
of a freeway constructed on a riverbed is problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Katz has worked on a number of good proposals to cure Los Angeles traffic 
problems; the recent compromise legislation involving relaxation of the Gann 
spending limit as it relates to transportation needs is the latest example. I 
hope he concentrates on those efforts and puts to rest the Los Angeles River 
Freeway.

SALINAS' ACHIEVEMENT: STAYING AFLOAT; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO: THE PRESIDENT'S PROMISED REFORMS HAVEN'T COME TRUE, BUT THE CONSUMER 
CLASS IS NEWLY OPTIMISTIC.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Carlos Salinas de Gortari approaches the end of his first year in office, 
his record remains contradictory and open to dispute. In his 
state-of-the-nation address last Wednesday, Salinas spelled out an ideological 
blueprint for the future, as most Mexican presidents do at the beginning of 
their terms, but cleared up few of the ambiguities that have surfaced in his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
The ambivalence of the past year's performance can be summed up in the 
president's own terms. Salinas, in a sense, declared the Mexican Revolution and 
its welfare state obsolete; presidents before him have done the same, but he 
provided a more specific justification. In his view, modern states cannot own 
or administer large swaths of the economy and at the same time provide basic 
services; they cannot administer justice and produce goods and services. In a 
nutshell, according to Salinas, "the dilemma is between ownership or justice, 
between a state that owns more, and one that is more just." 
</P>
<P>
Arguable in the abstract (it is far from clear why one thing detracts from the 
other, per se), this radical alternative clashes with the prevailing situation 
in Mexico today. The problem with Salinas' policies is that while they may 
reflect the first term of the dichotomy, a leaner state, at least in the intent 
to privatize important parts of the state-owned sector, the second term, more 
justice, remains absent. The Salinas administration is doing less in one area, 
but it is not doing more in others. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal budget for 1990 will be released this month. If the president's 
philosophical views were to be reflected in this essential instrument of a 
country's economic life, one would see fewer transfers of funds to inefficient 
state-related enterprises and significantly higher expenditures to more "just" 
areas: education, health, housing, drinking water, sewerage, etc. -- all 
necessary items that have been neglected for the last seven years. For 
instance, education spending has been cut in half during the 1980s, which 
explains why several hundred thousand elementary schoolteachers are on strike, 
yet the new budget will not show any important increases in education spending 
-- or in health or housing. There will be some additional spending for the 
so-called utterly poor, but much of it is administrative, budgetary 
rearranging; the net increment will not be significant. Thus while Salinas may 
get rave reviews abroad for his philosophical conversion to free-market 
policies, the benefits in Mexico, for now, are meager. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas was right when, at his inauguration, he said that the Mexican people's 
standard of living could not improve without major relief of the country's 
debt. But the debt agreement he signed with Mexico's creditors barely modified 
the existing situation. This will be reflected in the new budget. Once again, 
about 68% of total expenditures will have to be devoted to servicing the 
foreign and domestic debts. 
</P>
<P>
More important, perhaps, July's debt agreement has not yet produced any of the 
indirect effects originally expected. Foreign investment is up only in 
statements and promises; in fact, by midyear the actual flow was almost 50% 
below the midyear 1988 figure. Mexican capital in the United States began to 
return in significant quantities -- up to $2 billion; that has stopped since 
interest rates fell. Thanks to bridge loans and new lending from the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund, Mexico's external accounts are still 
manageable, but barely. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second contradictory aspect of Salinas' first year in office. His 
popularity among important sectors of the country's middle class has risen, and 
there is a certain sense of optimism in some areas. The question is whether 
this is due chiefly to Salinas' policies, media coups and personal prestige, or 
whether it stems from something more prosaic: the consumer boom that relatively 
affluent Mexicans are enjoying, thanks to the virtual freeze in the price of 
dollars over the last two years. Between an obviously overvalued dollar and an 
across-the-board trade opening, middle-class consumers can now purchase foreign 
goods at prices below those of the countries of origin. Trips to Florida or New 
York cost less than similar excursions in Mexico. Goods manufactured in Mexico 
with mostly imported contents are unbelievably cheap. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, of course, is showing up in the trade balance. The country is now 
running a small monthly trade deficit: Imports continue to skyrocket and 
exports are stagnant. This is all being paid for with new loans and reserves. 
Perhaps this is economically absurd, but it is a politically savvy way to 
defuse the widespread middle-class discontent that led to last year's electoral 
disaster for Salinas and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
Making the consumer class happy has also allowed Salinas to avoid fulfilling 
his other promise to the Mexican people: authentic electoral reform. New 
legislation approved two weeks ago by the PRI and PAN (National Action Party) 
factions in Congress leaves the PRI government's traditional majority intact in 
the Federal Electoral Commission, although it will now be achieved in an 
indirect fashion. It also guarantees any party with at least 35% of the vote a 
majority of the seats in Congress, thus artificially prolonging the one-party 
system. No reforms took place with regard to the election of the Senate, or in 
giving Mexicans abroad the right to vote, or in drawing up new registration 
rolls, or in forbidding indiscriminate use of federal funds by one party (the 
PRI), or to ensure equal access to the media for all political parties. With 
the middle class under control, the urgency for the electoral reform has 
dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
The larger question is whether the new administration's first year can be 
extended indefinitely. Many in Mexico believe that the United States will do 
whatever is necessary to keep Salinas solvent. Under these conditions, it is 
not impossible that, with time, something will break the right way, and the 
artificial economic and political honeymoon will become self-sustaining. If, 
however, when Mexico's reserves run out, the Bush Administration is not 
willing, or able, to come up with more money, there will be the devil to pay. 
But that will be later, which is better than now.

CRACKPOTS KEEP THE LID ON FETAL-TISSUE RESEARCH; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: EXPERIMENTS THAT PROMISE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON DISEASED HUMAN ORGANS 
ARE STYMIED BY ABORTION FOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Science &amp; Government Report, a Washington-based newsletter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the extension of an irrational ban started by the Reagan Administration, 
the crackpots have won again on forbidding federal money for promising research 
on Parkinson's and other serious diseases. The triumph extends an ideological 
rampage that has dismayed the medical research establishment and caused several 
distinguished scientists to reject invitations to take senior government posts. 
</P>
<P>
After a deliberation -- for which the outcome was never in doubt -- the Bush 
Administration recently announced that it would retain the prohibition against 
the use of federal funds for research involving the transplantation of fetal 
tissue from induced abortions. Never mind that early experiments indicate that 
transplanted fetal tissue has beneficial effects on diseased organs, and may be 
useful against a variety of dreadful maladies. Or that two panels of 
specialists appointed by the federal government concluded that the research 
should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
For abortion foes, who fill the upper ranks of the health bureaucracy in the 
Bush Administration, there's the far- fetched fear that hesitant women might be 
swayed toward abortion by the prospect of helping the sick. Therefore, it's 
impermissible, because, as Asst. Secretary of Health James O. Mason, an 
abortion foe, told the New York Times, the ban was "a matter of heart and mind 
as well."

No doubt, but the scientists who studied the controversy for the federal 
government concluded that safeguards could easily be devised to guard against 
exploitation of women contemplating abortion. A simple one, for example, would 
prohibit payment for aborted fetuses. The experimental results obtained so far 
with fetal tissue -- which is fast-growing and resistant to rejection -- have 
actually been mixed. But some have been so favorable that medical researchers 
believe that further research could lead to effective treatments for several 
dreadful maladies. Besides Parkinson's disease, these include Alzheimer's 
disease and childhood diabetes. The research may proceed with private funds, 
and some is in progress. But Washington is the great bankroll and influence in 
health research, and the Bush Administration's endorsement of the ban will 
continue a dampening effect on this line of research. 
</P>
<P>
The ban demonstrates anew the grip of the anti-abortion movement on the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the giant federal agency for medical 
service and research, and the ideological straitjacket that the right-to-life 
gang has made the uniform of the day for federal service.

THE REAL ISSUE IS LIFE -- AND WHO CONTROLS IT;

PREGNANCY: WOMAN, ONCE A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN, MAY SOON RANK THIRD, A MERE 
CONTAINER FOR THE MORE VALUED FETUS.

The debate about abortion has deflected attention from a growing political 
problem concerning its counterpart, pregnancy, and from the larger meaning of 
reproductive technology in general. When childbearing was unduly glorified, 
women were valued for their reproductive abilities and little else. 
</P>
<P>
But today's views of motherhood may be worse for women. Now that childbearing 
has been reduced to a technological achievement, and reproductive abilities are 
commodities that can be bought, women are even losing their value as 
childbearers. Because there is a market for (white) babies today, the fetus is 
increasingly valued, while the women in whom it resides and grows are 
increasingly devalued. The law is beginning to regard them as mere containers 
for the really precious commodity, the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Rothman, a sociologist and author of "Recreating Motherhood," fears 
that pregnant women are fast becoming viewed as unskilled workers on a 
reproductive assembly line. They are blamed for producing "flawed products," 
that is, fetuses with defects or damaged newborns. "America is developing a 
legal and medical system to monitor pregnant women, control them, keep them in 
line with 'fetal-abuse' statutes," she says. In the meantime, people 
conveniently overlook the cause of most "flawed fetuses" -- the appalling lack 
of prenatal services for millions of women. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, heartened by recent advances in prenatal technology, are 
sympathetic toward the "fetal rights" movement. Shouldn't the fetus be 
protected from a mother who cannot or will not take care of it properly? 
Shouldn't doctors get a court order to force a diabetic pregnant woman who does 
not seem to be taking care of herself to stay in the hospital during her 
pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Before you say yes, consider this: Who will care for the other children of that 
pregnant diabetic? Should doctors have gotten a court order, years ago, to 
force a pregnant woman to take thalidomide, or to lose 20 pounds (when it was 
mistakenly believed that pregnant women should not gain "too much" weight)? 
Moreover, where would you draw the line? If you can incarcerate a pregnant 
woman who takes cocaine, should you incarcerate one who drinks? How much does 
she have to drink? One wine spritzer a day? 
</P>
<P>
I am not denying the rage and horror one feels at seeing the tragic births of 
so many drug-affected infants. But why is society's reaction always the 
punitive one? Addicted mothers need treatment, not jail. We must not legislate 
solutions that are as dangerous as the problems they hope to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman argues for our developing a woman-centered way of looking at motherhood 
and reproduction. In such a perspective, she suggests, we would realize that 
pregnancy, like abortion, "takes its meaning from the woman in whose body the 
pregnancy is unfolding." That is why for one woman, an abortion is a minor 
inconvenience; for another, or even for the same woman on another occasion, it 
is the death of a baby. It is not a contradiction that women take motherhood 
seriously and yet may have abortions casually. The relationship between 
motherhood and abortion is like the relationship between marriage and divorce: 
In societies that take marriage most seriously, the divorce rate is highest, 
because people must have a way out of their most important commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The current focus on abortion therefore obscures the larger issues of 
reproduction in general -- and who controls it. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of this assertion is clear from the majority of anti-abortion 
groups that work as fervently to deny women birth control as they do to deny 
them abortion. 
</P>
<P>
These groups have also succeeded in preventing the United States from giving 
aid other nations that are trying desperately to limit their starving 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a controversy about when life begins. It is a controversy about 
woman's place: at home with children, or participating in the public sphere? It 
is not a debate about whether women should or shouldn't have abortions, since 
they always have and always will. It is a debate about female sexuality and 
whether women may be permitted to enjoy sexuality without fear of unwanted 
pregnancy. It is not a debate about the "right to life," since many 
anti-abortion groups would condemn fetuses to die slowly, after birth, of 
hereditary diseases, famine or malnutrition. It is a debate about who may make 
decisions about life -- the mother's life as well as the fetus'. 
</P>
<P>
If women and men do not confront these larger issues, society will continue 
down its current path, moving toward a chilling invasion of privacy into 
women's bodies and a relegation of women's rights to third place -- after men 
and fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
A far more humane path would permit diversity and choice, both for women who do 
not want to be forced into motherhood and for women who do not want to be 
forced out of it.

ANOTHER ISLAMIC FORCE AWAKENS IN THE TWILIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE TWIN CALLS OF PERESTROIKA AT HOME AND RELIGIOUS NATIONALISM 
ABROAD ARE BRINGING THE CENTRAL ASIAN SOVIET REPUBLICS INTO THE GEOPOLITICAL 
CALCULUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAM E. FULLER, Graham E. Fuller is the former vice chairman of the 
National Intelligence Council and is currently a senior political scientist at 
the RAND Corp.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world of Soviet Central Asia has long been a twilight zone for the West, at 
one time an exotic far-flung region redolent of the nomadic hordes of Genghis 
Khan, later sealed off from Western eyes for well over half a century by an 
Iron Curtain. But spectacular change, as everywhere else in the Soviet Union, 
has penetrated even to this area so remote from the West. Central Asia is 
stirring, affording us fascinating insights into what has been the uneasy 
coexistence of Russian and Muslim under some 70 years of rigid communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Central Asia can no longer be left out of our geopolitical calculus of 
the region. The Soviet Union's Islamic empire is now a major new political 
factor looming between the Russian lands of the north and the Muslim nations to 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
The world of Soviet Central Asia, encompassing the Muslim republics of 
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tadzhikistan, Kirghizistan and Uzbekistan, contribute 
to making the Soviet Union the fifth-biggest Muslim country in the world. 
Soviet Muslim Azerbaijan in the Caucasus completes the picture. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Soviet Muslims were relatively quiescent, as they have been under 
the iron fist of Soviet rule until so recently, the Islamic factor has not 
intruded heavily upon thinking in the Kremlin. In fact, the shoe has been on 
the other foot: For most of the last 70 years, Western policy-makers have 
worried about Moscow's ability to manipulate ethnic and religious factors to 
the detriment of Islamic countries on the Soviet Union's borders. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1917, the fledgling Bolshevik government in Moscow issued its 
historic "Appeal to the Muslim peoples of Russia and the East," with the aim of 
spreading revolution throughout Asia at the expense of the colonial empires of 
Britain and France. Muslim revolutionaries were actively courted and many were 
impressed into the Soviet campaign to weaken imperialism through the spread of 
world revolution. Trusted elements among Soviet minorities such as Uzbeks, 
Tatars, Tajiks and others were sent abroad as active instruments to proclaim 
the "freedom of Islam" in the Soviet Union and the benefits of 
Marxism-Leninism. While suppressing Muslims at home, the Soviets sought to 
exploit these same groups in their contacts with Muslims overseas. Soviet 
agents infiltrated Uzbek, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen and Tajik communities 
abroad in the hopes of using them as fifth columns against neighboring Muslim 
countries such as Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, the tide has turned. If once the threat of Islamic politics came 
through use of Soviet Muslim minorities against its neighbors, the threat now 
flows in the reverse direction. Enjoying ever greater amounts of cultural, 
political and religious freedom under Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost 
and perestroika, these large Muslim populations are now for the first time able 
to look south to the external Muslim world for inspiration and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The intellectual ferment of the Middle East, including Islamic fundamentalism, 
is having a direct affect on Soviet Muslims. As these Soviet republics gain 
greater voice and freedom within the union, their nationalist sentiments are 
rising. They seek new allies. Islam has always been a major vehicle of 
political expression in the Middle East, and Muslim Soviet Central Asia will be 
no exception. Several of these republics are now in the process of establishing 
direct independent foreign-policy and trade links with their Muslim neighbors, 
and express renewed interest in their fellow ethnics over the borders. 
</P>
<P>
It is little wonder that the Soviet Union therefore now sees its ties with Iran 
and Afghanistan in a quite different light than we do in the West. It is 
critical for the Soviets to win the good will of its Islamic neighbors, to gain 
their agreement not to fish in the troubled waters of the newly emergent Soviet 
Muslim populations. This rationale lies behind Soviet efforts to sharply 
improve relations with Iran, the one country potentially most capable of 
exporting its radical vision of Islam from Tehran to Tashkent. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, Moscow is willing to have almost anybody except 
fundamentalists come to power in Afghanistan. A fundamentalist regime in Kabul 
with blood vengeance in its eye could contribute seriously to further ferment 
in a Central Asia that defines its own ethnic identity in opposition to ethnic 
Russian domination. Even the mealy-mouthed official reaction to the Salman 
Rushdie affair aimed first and foremost at the practical goal of not offending 
Muslims, rather than at asserting the rights of free speech and intellectual 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet Central Asia starts to come into its own, we in the West will need to 
think differently about the geopolitics of the region. The "old Middle East" 
that we knew will now extend north into Soviet territory. The politics of those 
Muslim republics in time will become integrated into the politics of the region 
to the south, as it once did in history before being swallowed up into the 
Russian czarist empire. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of forces in Middle Eastern politics will be changing as these 
former colonies start to flex their muscles anew and enter the scene, perhaps 
taking directions we cannot now predict.

Would you believe that the two Los Angeles pro football teams -- the surging 
Raiders and fading Rams -- have the same won-loss record? . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the notion that the position of head coach is strictly honorary 
when Al Davis is your boss. Art Shell must be doing something different than 
predecessor Mike Shanahan. The Raiders are 4-1 under Shell after going 1-3 
under Shanahan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As long as a dozen years ago, John Madden told writers that Shell, his All-Pro 
tackle in Oakland, some day would make a great coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Art loves to tell old Raider stories at our team meetings," linebacker Jerry 
Robinson said. "We sit there and want him to go on and on." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's first touchdown run of seven yards, when he bulled his way through 
heavy hitting Cincinnati free safety Rickey Dixon, was more remarkable than his 
franchise record 92-yard sprint Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Time of possession remains the most overrated statistic in football. The 
Bengals led the Raiders, 31:44 to 28:16. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The post-Halloween weekend was more trick than treat for teams wearing orange 
and black in the Coliseum. Oregon State and the Bengals were outscored, 76-13, 
by USC and the Raiders. . . . Look for a shakeup in Terry Donahue's coaching 
staff next season at UCLA. He misses former offensive coordinator Homer Smith 
most of all. But Smith, who left after the 1986 season, is happy at Alabama and 
will remain a member of Bill Curry's staff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How Soon They Forget: On the Coliseum message board all season, Cliff "Brandy" 
has been listed as the Raiders' second leading all-time receiver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is it my imagination or are fewer quarterback in-the-grasp calls being made in 
the NFL this season? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer vs. Sunday Silence is Alydar vs. Affirmed all over. Like Alydar, Easy 
Goer has more natural ability than his rival. But, like Affirmed, Sunday 
Silence is the tougher competitor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nobody fits Al McGuire's description of an "aircraft carrier in the middle" 
better than David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs and U.S. Navy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Alex Stewart can rock Evander Holyfield, what is Mike Tyson going to do to 
him? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Junior Seau, who happens to be a junior, dominates a game like no other USC 
linebacker since Chip Banks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: Several Oregon State players say they were flat Saturday against the 
Trojans. Reaction: It really must have been tough to get up for still another 
big game after all those key Pacific 10 Conference contests the Beavers have 
played in recent years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Todd Marinovich and Boris Becker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich should become the first freshman to be named player of the year in 
the Pac-10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What is so difficult about finding regular linemates for Wayne Gretzky? Robbie 
Ftorek never could last season and new King Coach Tom Webster isn't doing a 
much better job now. Shucks, I'll volunteer to skate on a wing opposite The 
Great One. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The one word athletes hate to hear more than any other is "choke.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Vaccaro, the oddsmaker at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, has established 
Notre Dame as a modest 57-point favorite over SMU. "It would have been more," 
Vaccaro said, "but Lou Holtz probably will call off the dogs early because he 
has two big games at Penn State and Miami coming up." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Berndt has proven that his 18-game losing streak at Rice was no 
fluke by going 0-9 at Temple. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honesty in crowd counts went out the door years ago when the attendance meter 
was taken down from the rafters above the north basket at the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs down on Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy for keeping running back 
Mike Pringle on the bench when he was only five yards away from the NCAA 
single-game rushing record Saturday against New Mexico State. If Murphy were a 
baseball manager, he would lift a pitcher going for a no-hitter in the ninth 
inning in order to give his bullpen some work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever heard anyone praise a prevent defense? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only trouble with the "Two Geezers at Caesars" line about the George 
Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight is that it will be held at the Convention Hall in 
Atlantic City Jan. 15. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those cheering on the Clippers against the Houston Rockets from courtside 
seats Friday night were Tracy Austin, Danny Manning, and Ira Reiner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of year when a superstar defensive player could win the 
Heisman Trophy, but there simply isn't one around. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'll watch anything on ESPN except the tractor pulls. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin's agent, Henry Holmes, tried to reach a couple of members of 
the Clippers' negotiating team by phone at owner Donald Sterling's office late 
the other night. After having no luck, Holmes asked for the name of the person 
on the other end of the line. "I'm the janitor," said Donald Sterling, who then 
hung up.

Don Majkowski's arm delivered a touchdown pass in the closing seconds Sunday 
that appeared to beat the Chicago Bears, but where, everyone wanted to know, 
was the ball when it left his hand? 
</P>
<P>
With a fourth down at the Bears' 14-yard line with 32 seconds left, Majkowski 
scrambled and threw to Sterling Sharpe in the end zone. Line judge Jim Quirk 
ruled, however, that the Green Bay quarterback had crossed the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Packers, the replay official saw it differently. So the 
Packers got the touchdown, Chris Jacke kicked the extra point and Green Bay had 
a 14-13 victory over the Bears, its first since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you if anybody doesn't like the instant replay now, they're crazy," 
Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had full confidence that I wasn't over the line," said Majkowski, who had 
fumbled and thrown an interception to ruin two earlier fourth-quarter drives by 
Green Bay. "I have a pretty good sense of where I am on the field and I was 
disappointed that the referee threw the flag all the way from the other side of 
the field." 
</P>
<P>
The review of the replay took nearly five minutes to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very important play. The game hinges on this play. We took our time 
and looked at both feeds," replay official Bill Parkinson said. "The ball did 
not cross the line of scrimmage when he threw it." 
</P>
<P>
Bear linebacker Ron Rivera, who recovered the Majkowski fumble and intercepted 
one of his passes in the fourth quarter as the Bears defense tried to preserve 
a 13-7 lead, wasn't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought judgment calls couldn't be overruled," Rivera said. "If 
that's what it's come down to, they've definitely taken out the human nature in 
football. We might as well be robots in football uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski shook off his two earlier mistakes, and starting with 4:44 to go, 
drove the Packers 73 yards for the winning score. Green Bay had a first down at 
the seven, but Majkowski was sacked and threw two incompletions, setting up the 
fourth down. He sprinted to his right and, at the last second, fired the ball 
to Sharpe, who was cutting across the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"After I didn't see the initial pass open, I kind of went out and scrambled and 
bought some time and tried to make something happen on an improvised play, 
which we've done a couple of times this year," Majkwoski said. "I just threw 
the ball in there and Sterling made a great play." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said: "It's a big win for them and a disappointing 
loss for us. I can't comment (on the replay call). I really didn't see it." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers (5-4) had lost eight straight to the Bears (5-4). Only six members 
of the current Packers had ever beaten Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Harbaugh, making his start of the season, led the Bears 80 
yards to a go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter. The key plays of the drive 
included a pass to James Thornton for 22 yards and one to Dennis Gentry, good 
for 46 to the Packer 20. Brad Muster scored on a two-yard to make it 13-7.

</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO: KICKER MISSES FIRST TRY AT GAME-WINNING FIELD GOAL, BUT GETS A 
SECOND CHANCE BECAUSE OF A PENALTY AND MAKES A 49-YARDER WITH FOUR SECONDS LEFT 
TO BEAT EAGLES, 20-17.

<P>
For four weeks, the Chargers had found more ways to lose than they cared to 
imagine or admit. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday afternoon at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, they discovered a way to 
win that was more creative than, say, something written by Woody Allen and more 
exciting than a victory by Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bahr's 49-yard field goal with four seconds remaining beat the heavily 
favored Philadelphia Eagles, 20-17. It was Bahr's longest field goal of the 
season and the Eagles' first defeat after four consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
And it might never have happened if reserve tackle James FitzPatrick hadn't 
made a false start on the play before the game-winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time a penalty has ever helped us," Charger Coach Dan Henning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take a double-negative every time if it gives us a win," FitzPatrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An explanation: 
</P>
<P>
After the Eagles had capitalized on an Eric Allen interception of a tipped Jim 
McMahon pass and tied the game, 17-17, on Keith Byars' three-yard run early in 
the final period, the game appeared headed for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But with less than a minute to play, McMahon, who finished with 14 completions 
in 29 attempts for 264 yards and two touchdowns, found rookie wide receiver 
Wayne Walker streaking up the right sideline past cornerback Izel Jenkins for 
49 yards and a first down at the Eagle 27. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Bahr was lining up the 44-yarder that would win the game, 
providing he didn't hook it to the left like the 33-yarder he attempted in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Chargers, he did pull it. But because FitzPatrick moved 
before the snap, a dead ball foul was called and the play was negated. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw my whole life flash in front of my face," said FitzPatrick, who knew he 
had moved before the snap. "The first thing that goes through your mind is, 
'Jeez, I hope nobody saw it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But even before Bahr could get his foot into the ball, flags were littering the 
air. "I was just trying to stay low," FitzPatrick said. "But I flinched." 
</P>
<P>
By then all he could do was watch and hope the kick would miss. "I knew we'd 
get another chance because of the penalty," he said. What he couldn't be sure 
of was whether Bahr would make the second attempt if the first had been good. 
When it sailed to the left, FitzPatrick breathed easier. 
</P>
<P>
"God or somebody must have turned that ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bahr was also glad to get another chance. He said the whistles 
and flags that preceded the missed kick had not distracted him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pulled across it," he said. The five extra yards, he said, didn't 
bother him either. 
</P>
<P>
"On the second one, I just told myself to make a good swing," he said. "Sure I 
was nervous. Anybody who says they aren't in that situation is a liar. But I 
wasn't scared. And there's a difference. I just said, 'Trust your swing and 
make a good one.' It's just a shame this didn't happen three games ago." 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth consecutive week that the Chargers (3-6) had a chance to tie 
or win the game on their last possession. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, it was refreshing to hear Henning talk about how the Chargers kept 
extra blockers in to contain Eagle defensive end Reggie White and limit 
Philadelphia (6-3) to two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Or hear Anthony Miller talk about how Eagle free safety Wes Hopkins bit on the 
play fake that set up his 69-yard touchdown late in the third period. It was 
the Chargers' longest play of the year and hiked their lead to 17-7. Their 
first 10 points came on a six-yard touchdown pass from McMahon to Miller, who 
made a spectacular one-handed catch, and a 23-yard field goal by Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia scored on a four-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter from 
Randall Cunningham (19 of 29 for 236 yards) to wide receiver Greg Garrity and a 
43-yard field goal by ex-Charger Steve DeLine. Garrity broke his collarbone on 
the play and will miss the rest of the season.

FINALLY, COWBOYS GET A VICTORY;

DALLAS: RETURN OF REDSKIN QUARTERBACK DOUG WILLIAMS IS SPOILED.

After enduring eight straight losses, Dallas Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson knows 
that one victory -- even if it's his first as an NFL coach -- is nothing to 
crow about. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a long way to go. The rocky days are not over for the Cowboys," 
Johnson said Sunday night after Dallas won its first game of the post-Tom 
Landry era by shutting down the Washington Redskins, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer rushed for 110 yards and scored the game's only touchdown as the 
Cowboys (1-8) won for only the second time in their last 21 games. Both wins 
have come against the Redskins at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a frustrating year," Johnson said. "You might say it's a relief, a 
good feeling, to get this win. We're starting to come together, although we 
know we have a lot of hard work to do." 
</P>
<P>
The 0-8 start was the second-worst in Cowboy history. They lost their first 10 
games in 1960, their inaugural season under Landry, the man Johnson replaced 
after Jerry Jones bought the team earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Johnson averted the embarrassment of losing as many games in 
consecutive weeks in the NFL as he did in five years at Miami, where he won a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we could win when it was 3-3 in the third quarter," Johnson said. "I 
just didn't want us to turn the ball over. We have a young team and we've had a 
problem with turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas' victory spoiled the return of Doug Williams, the hero of the Redskins' 
Super Bowl victory in January, 1988, who played for the first time since 
undergoing back surgery in August. Williams completed 28 of 52 passes for 296 
yards but was intercepted twice and was unable to get the NFL's top-ranked 
offense into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug was off tonight," Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs said. "But I still feel good 
about my decision to start him, and he wasn't the only one who was a bit off." 
</P>
<P>
Williams played despite the recent death of his father. He will leave today for 
the funeral Tuesday in Zachary, La. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't put anything together, but it wasn't a one-person loss," said 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas broke a 3-3 tie late in the third quarter when Palmer, following a block 
by guard Crawford Ker, burst through the middle for a 47-yard gain to the 
Washington six. Two plays later, Palmer scored from the two. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second touchdown in the third quarter for the Cowboys this 
season.

Ray Perkins figures six touchdowns ought to be enough to win any game. The 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, however, scored only four of them for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde threw four interceptions and Cleveland's Felix Wright and 
Thane Gash returned two of them for touchdowns on successive plays Sunday in 
the Cleveland Browns' 42-31 victory over the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense scored 52 points, but only 31 counted for us," said Perkins, who 
also watched Frank Minnifield intercept Testaverde and return it 25 yards to 
set up one of Bernie Kosar's three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Wright picked off a tipped pass intended for Danny Peebles and ran it back 27 
yards for a touchdown midway through the second quarter. Gash stepped in front 
of Mark Carrier on the next play from scrimmage and scored on a 15-yard return 
for a 28-7 advantage 19 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
The runbacks gave the Browns a commanding lead but some of the energy from the 
two-touchdown surge was sapped on Tampa Bay's next possession when Gash was 
injured defending a pass thrown into the Cleveland end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Gash, who lunged toward Bruce Hill in an effort to break up the incomplete 
pass, landed on his head and stayed on the ground for several minutes receiving 
medical attention. He was carried by stretcher to the locker room where X-rays 
were taken of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the tests were "favorable," the team announced, and the 
second-year safety watched the second half from the sideline wearing a neck 
brace. His replacement, Robert Lyons, had the fourth interception of 
Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my balance and landed on my head," Gash said. "It was pretty scary at 
the time. It still hurts, but I'm hoping it will clear up in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third straight for Cleveland (6-3), which was outgained 398 
yards to 271. The Bucs are now 3-6.

MOON IS TOP CAT AGAINST LIONS;

HOUSTON: OILER QUARTERBACK PULLS TRIGGER ON LIONS' RUN-AND-SHOOT OFFENSE IN 
35-21 WIN.

Houston quarterback Warren Moon watched Detroit rookies Rodney Peete and Barry 
Sanders push the Lions' run-and-shoot offense through the Oilers' defense in 
the first half on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second half, it was Moon's turn to show what the Oilers' 
run-and-shoot could do. 
</P>
<P>
Moon threw touchdown passes of six yards to Ernest Givins and seven to Drew 
Hill in the third quarter and ran for another in the fourth to lead the Oilers 
to a 35-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Peete and Sanders had helped the Lions take a 24-14 lead early in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon led an 18-play, 87-yard drive that consumed 10:29 and scored what 
proved to be the winning touchdown with 3:15 left on a two-yard run, giving 
Houston a 35-24 lead. He completed 11 consecutive passes during one stretch in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Moon, who completed 30 of 38 passes for 345 yards, the Oilers (5-4) 
held off the Lions (1-8). Detroit came into the game with 30 turnovers, most in 
the NFL, but it was the Oilers who lost three fumbles and an interception while 
Detroit turned over the ball twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of them turning it over, we turned it over," Oilers Coach Jerry 
Glanville said. "They had a hard time stopping us, and Warren Moon helped us. 
Because of him we were able to stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took a 17-14 halftime lead and, on the first play of the third quarter, 
Mike Rozier fumbled at his own 26-yard line and the Lions turned it into a 
24-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brooks first picked up the ball and ran three yards before he, too, 
fumbled. William White scooped it up and ran 20 more yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who gained 91 yards in 19 carries, ran one yard for a touchdown, Peete 
threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Robert Clark and Eddie Murray kicked a 
47-yard field goal for Detroit's halftime lead. Houston scored on one-yard runs 
by Lorenzo White and Rozier. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier's third-quarter fumble temporarily foiled the Oilers' halftime plan to 
seize control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Peete completed 18 of 29 passes for 273 yards.

WALLACE GETS PUSHED ASIDE AT PHOENIX; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: BILL ELLIOTT WINS AUTOWORKS 500 AFTER WALLACE, THE NASCAR POINTS 
LEADER, IS SENT SPINNING INTO A CONCRETE WALL BY STAN BARRETT.

<P>
When Stan Barrett pierced the sound barrier at 739.666 m.p.h. in 1979, he drove 
in a straight line and there were no other cars on the track at Edwards Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, at Phoenix International Raceway, where he was surrounded by cars and 
forced to make left-hand turns in the Autoworks 500 for Winston Cup stock cars, 
he found driving about 100 m.p.h. more of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, in only his fourth race this season, clipped the left rear wheel of 
Rusty Wallace's Pontiac in the second turn 56 miles from the end of the race 
and sent the NASCAR points leader and the leader of the race spinning into the 
concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace had been 20 seconds ahead a few laps earlier and appeared to be 
cruising toward clinching his first Winston Cup championship and its $1 million 
bonus. After several stops to repair his crumpled car, Wallace returned to the 
race and finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Elliott, last year's series champion, led the final 47 laps in a Ford to 
win an extremely competitive race in which 13 cars finished on the same lap as 
Elliott and 30 of the 43 cars were still running when the race ended. One, 
however, Greg Sacks' florescent green and yellow Chevy, was 152 laps in 
arrears. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's winning speed of 105.683 m.p.h. shattered the race record of 90.457 
set last year by Alan Kulwicki. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who came into the race with a 109-point lead over Dale Earnhardt, saw 
his margin cut to 78 with one race remaining. Mark Martin, who finished third 
behind Terry Labonte, moved past Earnhardt, who finished sixth, by one point. 
Darrell Waltrip was fourth and Dale Jarrett, son of former champion Ned 
Jarrett, fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with Barrett caused Wallace to lose 50 points to Martin and 30 to 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
In the season finale, Nov. 19 at Atlanta, Wallace needs to finish 18th or 
better to win the championship no matter what Martin or Earnhardt do. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe what happened, it was a lapped car, a guy I'd lapped about 10 
times, and he wrecks me," Wallace said. "Here's a guy who runs only two or 
three times a year, and something like that happens." 
</P>
<P>
This was actually Barrett's fourth race. He finished 26th at Watkins Glen, 34th 
at Talladega and 37th at Charlotte. After breaking the sound barrier, Barrett, 
known as the Rocket Man, drove the Winston Cup circuit for stuntman Hal Needham 
in 1980 and 1981 with little success. 
</P>
<P>
"He apologized and I guess he meant it, but I just wish the inexperienced 
drivers would come out earlier in the year instead of right here at the end 
when there's so much strategic stuff going on. A lot of the newer drivers were 
driving over their head today." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett had spun in the first turn earlier in the race, but continued after 
pitting for a new set of tires. At the time he bumped Wallace, he was 13 laps 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Junie Donlavey, who owns the Ford that Barrett drove, said the brakes were 
failing on the car. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan said he was riding the brakes and it got down to where he had to pump 
them. He'd just pitted and gone back out for a lap when Rusty came by him. He 
dropped down to let Rusty go by, and when he got to the corner he put his foot 
on the brakes, and the pedal went to the floor. In other words, if he'd had 
time, he could have pumped 'em back up, if Rusty hadn't been right there." 
</P>
<P>
Pole-sitter Ken Schrader, who stood to win the Unocal bonus of $197,600 if he 
won the race from the pole, led briefly at the start of the 312-lap race but 
was slowed by ignition problems and finished 13th. The bonus will be $410,000 
at Atlanta as the track is matching Unocal's prize, which is an accumulation of 
27 races at $7,600 since a driver won wire-to-wire. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing about this pole jinx, but you can win from the front just as 
easy as you do from the third or fourth starting position," Schrader said. "If 
it weren't for that bonus, no one would be thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go to Atlanta and try to win the pole, and then we'll try just as hard 
to win the race. But if we don't win the pole, we'll still try just as hard to 
win the race. It's the same with all the guys." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, if he listens to Elliott, may not try quite as hard as Earnhardt, 
Martin and the others. Last year at Atlanta, Elliott's lead over Wallace was 
exactly the same as Wallace's over Martin this year. Elliott drove 
conservatively, finished 11th and beat Wallace, who won the race, by 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Rusty criticized me last year for not driving harder, but the championship is 
an accumulation of all the races all year and winning the championship was our 
goal and we accomplished it," Elliott said. "You never can tell what's going to 
happen. Look at today, Rusty just about had the championship clinched and then 
he loses nearly half his lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was Rusty, I'd go to Atlanta with a conservative approach. He says that's 
not his style, but we'll see. I'm going to enjoy watching what he does, 
hopefully from my rear view mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who said he could not have beaten Wallace or Kulwicki if they hadn't 
had problems, collected $57,900. It was his third victory this year after a 
slow start because of a broken arm before the Daytona 500 opening race. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but feel good about this season even though we're only fifth in 
the points," the Dawsonville, Ga., driver said. "After what happened in 
February, what we accomplished was monumental. When a driver is hurt, it means 
you can't test, and if you can't test, it means you fall a half a lap behind 
the other guys. 
</P>
<P>
"This win really pumped up our guys and we'll go to Atlanta looking for another 
win on our home track. Then we can start looking to next year and getting the 
championship back." 
</P>
<P>
Kulwicki, last year's winner, led 91 laps, 10 more than Wallace, but a poor pit 
stop dropped him a lap down. A rookie jack man, handling the chore for the 
first time, let the car down too soon and it to be jacked up again to finish 
changing the right-side tires. 
</P>
<P>
A record crowd of more than 65,000 watched the race.

expansion Timberwolves, 93-83, Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey added 16 points and Kevin Duckworth 15 for Portland. Portland

Tony Campbell scored 10 points in the first quarter and finished with 20 for

The Trail Blazers led, 43-42, at halftime and increased the lead to 65-61 after 
three quarters. Portland's Buck Williams was called for two technical fouls and 
ejected after arguing with Minnesota's Scott Roth early in the fourth period, 
and Campbell made a foul shot that made it 65-62. 
</P>
<P>
Portland then scored eight straight points. A three-point play by Roth got the 
Timberwolves to within 73-65, but the Trail Blazers quickly increased the lead 
to 13 points and were never threatened.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: URGE SHY KIDS TO TAKE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Both my children are very shy and, as a result, I'm afraid 
they're limiting themselves. I worry because they often tell me that they'd 
prefer not to go to school dances or enter into extracurricular activities. I 
was just the opposite, so it's difficult for me to understand. How can I help 
them be more outgoing? 
</P>
<P>
F.G.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.G.T.: It's difficult for me to tell whether you're describing a tendency 
for your youngsters to be introverted, or whether they're really limiting 
themselves or avoiding risks of all kinds because of shyness. 
</P>
<P>
If they have one or two close friends, but prefer to avoid large groups, if 
they're more comfortable reading or doing other quiet activities rather than 
going to school dances or athletic events, I wouldn't worry. Because you were 
more extroverted doesn't mean they should follow in your footsteps. I'm not 
sure you should encourage them to be more outgoing. It's not easy or desirable 
to turn an introvert into an extrovert, or vice versa. There's plenty of room 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is that your children develop their talents and live up to 
their full potential. Extreme shyness will interfere with this. Children should 
be encouraged to take intellectual risks, trying out new concepts knowing that 
if they make a mistake, it won't matter, for this is one way we learn. Shy 
people are afraid of failing, and overly demanding parents can increase this 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have an irritating habit of crying whenever I'm really 
angry. Since I'm now working in an office where I'm looking for a promotion, 
this can prove embarrassing. Thus far, I've always been able to get some 
private spot where no one notices, but how can I break myself of this idiotic 
habit? As a woman, I know it's going to work against me. 
</P>
<P>
T.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR T.T.: While crying in the office isn't a great idea, it's not that 
unusual, according to recent statistics unearthed by psychologists Jeanne Plas 
and Kathleen Hoover-Dempsey. Apparently, 80% of the women and 50% of men 
admitted to having had at least one good (or bad) cry while at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Grief is the most common reason for both, but joy is the second most common 
reason for men, while anger takes second place as the cause of tears for women. 
Males have been brought up to feel that the emotion of anger is acceptable, 
even "manly," while females haven't been socialized in the same way. Women 
aren't supposed to get angry, and if they do, they're not supposed to express 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Once you realize that it's all right to be angry and you learn constructive 
ways to express those feelings, you won't cry. Women have as much right to 
express disapproval and to express their feelings as men do; both sexes need to 
learn to be assertive and rational, rather than aggressive and irrational.

EXERCISE THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON, Neil Solomon is author of a new book Sick &amp; Tired of 
Being Sick &amp; Tired, Wynwood Press. If you have a medical question, write to 
Dr. Neil Solomon, P.O. Box 36184, Baltimore, Md. 21286-6184. Dr. Solomon cannot 
give personal replies but will answer as many questions as possible in his 
column.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: People who have exercised all of their lives and who continue to 
exercise into their 60s and later are in much better physical condition than 
the kinds of people who fall into the couch-potato category. This is so obvious 
that no one should be surprised by it. But what about the mind? Does using the 
brain help a person stay sharp as he gets older? If so, what kind of mental 
exercise would be helpful? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The admonition "use it or lose it" applies to the mind as well as to 
the body. A person who wants to remain mentally sharp requires mental 
stimulation, and if the person no longer works, the stimulation, obviously, 
must come from somewhere other than a job. 
</P>
<P>
Finding sources of mental stimulation is not a difficult task. Libraries 
contain interesting and challenging material, and so do newspapers and 
periodicals. An individual seeking food for the mind does not have to look very 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Being with people can also be mentally stimulating. Many communities offer 
lectures and other programs that meet both a social and intellectual need. The 
theater, concerts, even athletic events serve the same purpose. And just 
because you may never have been interested in such programs is no reason not to 
participate in them now. It's never too late to develop new interests.

Blake Cause of Death Revealed Actress Amanda Blake, who starred for many years 
as television's Miss Kitty in the Western series "Gunsmoke," died of AIDS, her 
doctor has confirmed. Her Aug. 16 death of throat cancer at age 60 was 
complicated by a type of viral hepatitis brought on by acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, her physician Lou Nishimura said Saturday. She died at 
Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento. Nishimura said that he listed AIDS as a 
cause of death on Blake's death certificate but that it was not disclosed 
publicly. The doctor said he heard nothing more about it until he was called 
Friday by Sacramento television anchorwoman Christine Craft (who in the early 
1980s filed a highly publicized sex-discrimination suit against her former 
employer, a Kansas City television station). Nishimura said Blake never told 
him how she became infected with the fatal disease. He said the actress was not 
a user of drug needles and had not contracted the disease through a blood 
transfusion. Claudia Puig and Aleene MacMinn

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIAGUILD GIVES ITS NEGOTIATORS STRIKE AUTHORIZATION AT 
U-T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its two-year contract struggle with the Union-Tribune 
Publishing Co., the local chapter of the Newspaper Guild is talking about a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The general membership of the Guild, which represents more than 1,000 newsroom, 
circulation and advertising employees at the paper, recently voted to give its 
bargaining committee the power to call for a strike. If the committee votes to 
strike, the general membership and the international office of the Guild would 
still have to approve the decision. 
</P>
<P>
At a membership meeting scheduled for Wednesday, the formation of committees to 
make strike preparations, such as finding a strike headquarters office and 
itemizing the Guild's resources, is high on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be able to organize our people," said Guild President Ed Jahn. 
"People are losing patience. We have to marshal our forces as best as possible 
and see what we have, and then bargain accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Guild is moving into a strike posture simply as a bargaining ploy, 
it is sure to raise tension at the plant. Beginning Thursday, several writers 
will begin a voluntary, indefinite byline strike, removing their names from 
their stories. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Guild officials have decided to find out exactly what kind of 
support they have in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to order anybody" to participate, Jahn said. "We're not going 
hold anybody to it or alienate anybody. But it's coming down to whether you're 
for us or against us." 
</P>
<P>
There had been some indications that the Guild and the company were making 
progress in their negotiations. But that is clearly not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn accuses the company of stalling, of trying to prolong the process and wear 
down the Guild. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their plan, to get us hopeful and kick the chair out from under us," 
Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The unions representing pressroom employees and plate-makers at the U-T 
recently agreed to a contract, which included anti-union concessions such as a 
no-strike clause -- concessions the Guild is unwilling to make. Seeing its 
sister unions settle with the U-T certainly was not good news to the Newspaper 
Guild. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the Guild filed suit in federal court to compel the company to 
enter arbitration over the long-standing issue of the automatic deduction of 
union dues from paychecks. The company canceled the automatic deductions after 
the Guild's contract expired in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale is at rock bottom," Jahn said. "It's a sad experience here." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiation sessions are still being scheduled for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to pursue negotiations and find a fair settlement," said Herbert 
Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers, the U-T's parent organization. "We 
were encouraged by the settlement with the press and plate-makers." 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, U-T editors, under direction of management, began 
preparing for a possible strike, producing mock issues in weekend sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn said the Guild has no timetable for a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The better prepared we are to strike the less chance we have to strike," Jahn 
said. "We want to push the company close enough to the edge of the cliff that 
they can look over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Taking the analogy a step further, Jahn noted that talk of a strike is ominous 
for both sides. "We have to remember that the company is handcuffed to the 
employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
You can say a lot of things about Mayor Maureen O'Connor, but don't call her a 
gum chewer. After Tribune reporter Robert Hawkins referred to her as 
"gum-chewing Mayor O'Connor" in a story about the opening of the Tbilisi State 
Marionette Theatre, reportedly the irate mayor personally called the Tribune to 
demand a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
After much give and take between Tribune editors and the mayor's staff, the 
Tribune printed a "clarification" noting that, according to mayor spokesman 
Paul Downey, O'Connor was "chewing a breath mint," not gum. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was worried about the "connotation that she was somehow being 
disrespectful to the performers or to the audience," Downey said later. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 weatherman/comedian Larry Mendte can now be seen on KNSD-TV (Channel 
39). Mendte has been hired by the syndicated tabloid show "Hard Copy" to do his 
"How Come?" segments, the weekly feature he does during the Channel 8 news. But 
Channel 39, not Channel 8, carries "Hard Copy" in San Diego, running it during 
the weekend. Channel 39 program director Penny Martin was surprised to hear 
"Hard Copy" had hired Mendte, but said she "didn't see any problem with it." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Michael Tuck announced that he's heading to KCBS-TV (Channel 2) in 
Los Angeles at the end of his current contract, but he's not necessarily going 
to replace Jim Lampley, who announced his engagement to fellow anchor Bree 
Walker last week. Channel 2 news director Michael Singer denounced reports that 
Lampley is leaving as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"We have room for lots of good anchors," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, KCBS is doubling Tuck's current salary, which 
is reportedly about $400,000 a year. Singer would only say that Tuck had been 
signed to a long-term contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) raised $234,700 for the victims of the Bay Area earthquake 
with its post-World Series telethon. While corporate donations helped move 
things along, more than $150,000 came from individuals who called during the 
telethon. Channel 10 deserves credit for making a real commitment of time, 
resources and money, in sharp contrast to those who attempted to get the 
maximum publicity from the minimum sacrifice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Alaska's Killer Whales," a documentary scheduled to air at 10:30 p.m., 
Wednesday on KPBS-TV (Channel 15), is an interesting and well-photographed look 
at the controversies surrounding the whales, from the disputes with fishermen 
in Alaska to Sea World research. But it's a little dated. It discusses the 
business pressures facing Sea World, without mentioning the recent sale. And 
the documentary was completed before the recent death of Kandu once again 
raised the question of the animals' well-being in captivity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39's "San Diego Headliners" and Channel 8's "Close-Up with Carl 
Sisskind" demonstrated the value of local public affairs shows last week. 
"Headliners" put Sheriff John Duffy on the spot for a lengthy interview, and 
Sisskind hosted a spitting match between council candidates Ed Struiksma and 
Linda Bernhardt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's official: After several months with "interim" in front of his title, Mike 
Novak has been named program and operations manager for KFMB-FM (B100). . . . 
</P>
<P>
KKLQ (Q106) has hired Rusty Humphries from KBEQ in Kansas City, to supplement 
its morning show. Apparently program director Garry Wall will continue to host 
the show.

New Ballet Master: The New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet has 
formally announced the appointment of Robert Lindgren as president. Lindgren 
succeeds Lincoln Kirstein, who co-founded the school with George Balanchine in 
1934. Kirstein announced last week that he would retire from both his 
positions, as president of the school and as general director of the New York 
City Ballet. Lindgren, who danced under Balanchine, has been with the School of 
American Ballet since 1987 as executive vice president. Lindgren has also 
performed in Ballet Theater with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. After 
retiring from his dancing career, he established a ballet school in Phoenix 
with his wife, Sonja Tyven, also a former dancer with the New York City Ballet 
and the Ballet Russe. Lindgren will have responsibility for all administrative 
functions. Peter Martins will continue as chairman of the faculty. Claudia Puig

Lost and Found: It's been musical chairs -- and directors and actors -- at the 
Matrix Theatre, where Saturday night's opening of Constance Congdon's 
much-anticipated "Tales of the Lost Formicans" was postponed for the second 
time. Gone with the elaborate set and rear-screen projection effects are 
actress Bette Ford and director Michael Arabian. K Callan is in for Ford, 
Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori and Lee Shallat are the new directors. The opening has 
been re-scheduled for Sunday. Claudia Puig and Aleene MacMinn

KRONOS QUARTET PLAYS ECLECTIC PROGRAM AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their usual, sophisticatedly packaged fashion, the Kronos Quartet 
demonstrated their ability to successfully take several different kinds of 
music and put them together into a consistent, avant-garde program Saturday 
night at Wadsworth Theatre. Included in their performance were examples of 
ethno-pop, minimalism, Renaissance, rock, blues and at least one established 
20th-Century masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The latter was Charles Ives Second String Quartet (1913), a last-minute 
substitution which became their most daring undertaking. All of the odd 
phrases, difficult synchronizations and humorous effects blended expertly into 
a thoroughly virtuosic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Equally engaging was the Los Angeles premiere of Terry Riley's "The Gift," a 
collection of chant-like passages and patterns inspired by East Indian music. 
Riley continues to be the most pleasingly unpredictable of minimalist 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, excessive reverb, unintended distortion and other problems in 
the amplification system marred much of the fare. 
</P>
<P>
This was most apparent in the L.A. premiere of Carlos Farinas' graphically 
notated "Tatomaite" (1972), in which the ensemble made use of different-sized 
gongs, temple blocks, maracas and bongos, all sounding washed out in a sea of 
antiseptic reverberation. The Kronos' own arrangement of the Tallis 40-Part 
Motet also fell short of expectations due to a prerecorded part that frequently 
buzzed and distorted. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the program were three tonal pieces by African composers, two of them 
Los Angeles premieres: from Uganda, Justinian Tamusuza's infectious folk tune 
setting "Mu Kkubo Ery' Omusaalaba," and from Sudan, Hamza El Din's more 
tranquil, Arab-influenced "Escalay." The other work by white South African 
Kevin Volans, "White Man Sleeps, Dance 4" (1985), proved more routine. 
</P>
<P>
Two encores of intricate arrangements of rock tunes by Steven Mackey completed 
the program. "Foxy Lady" by Jimi Hendrix gave the ensemble a chance to ham it 
up while Muddy Waters' slower, more meditative "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man" 
revealed a less brutal pop sensibility.GREGG WAGER

CARTER OCTET AT INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a certain appropriateness to the appearance of the John Carter Octet 
at the first concert in the Southern California Institute of Architecture's new 
music series Saturday night in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Carter and SCI-ARC share vigorously contemporary views of their respective 
creative disciplines, and the iconoclastic sounds of the Octet sounded 
perfectly at home in the warehouse high-tech environment of the school's main 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The program consisted of six extended selections from Carter's "Castles of 
Ghana" Suite. While the clarinetist is a firm advocate of unfettered 
improvisation, "Castles" was a through-composed piece rich with fascinating 
textures and colors. Acerbic dissonances, leaping melodies and brooding bass 
ostinatos dominated the work. A series of passionate "free" improvisations -- 
most notably those by Carter, saxophonist Charles Owens, cornetist Bobby 
Bradford and bassist Roberto Miranda -- circled through and around the composed 
sections. DON HECKMAN

POP CAPSULES: MIRACLE LEGION EDGY AND WHIMSICAL AT BOGART'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On its current album "Me and Mr. Ray," Miracle Legion, a group led by the duo 
of Mark J. Mulcahy and Ray Neal, soft-pedals sounds suited for introspective 
neo-folkies living on double espressos and tattered copies of Camus. So it was 
a surprise when the Connecticut-based band (now a quartet) exploded on stage at 
Bogart's on Friday with a refreshing surge of thorny post-punkisms. Even if 
it's not 100% focused yet, this is a group with wide-angle vision. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like a cousin of Tiny Tim, singer Mulcahy occasionally overdid the 
"look ma, I'm eccentric" routine, but his raspy tone and gliding phrases recall 
the emotional purity of Van Morrison. Guitarist Neal, a bundle of raw intensity 
and Yankee ingenuity, transformed simple riffs into power cycles by dint of 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the songs worked -- some are too arch, others too enigmatic -- but 
Miracle Legion's hard edginess and sweet poetic whimsy are a bright light in 
the increasingly dim field of independent, non-metallic, American bands. CRAIG 
LEE

POP CAPSULES: SMITH AT UNIVERSAL WASN'T TOO TEMPTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No, they haven't added a "Last Temptation of Christ" ride to the Universal 
Studios Tour. All that Jesus stuff Saturday night was just the Michael W. Smith 
concert at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
While there was plenty of Christ, there was little sense of temptation -- or 
anything to test and challenge faith. Smith and his seven-piece band's show 
merely served to affirm the values of a Christian life, no less (or more) than 
L.A. Guns affirms a party life as, well, righteous. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Smith would appear to be the "George Michael of Christian 
pop" tag he's been given. Toward the end of the show he even donned a 
Michael-like blue jeans and leather jacket outfit and engaged in the silliest 
of several sillily choreographed dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
Let's pretend for a minute that Smith is not a Christian popster, that his show 
dealt with the conventional mainstream pop concerns of love and/or lust. What 
you'd have then would be just a slick, cliched, gimmicky contempo-pop show -- 
and probably an empty house, as the enthusiastic, youthful sell-out crowd was 
clearly there because of the Christian themes. STEVE HOCHMAN

There was an air of irony as former sailors who served aboard the Lexington in 
World War II joined with the aircraft carrier's crew over the weekend in 
Pensacola, Fla., to remember shipmates who died 45 years ago. An association of 
former crew members had originally planned its reunion to coincide with the 
45th anniversary of the day a Japanese suicide plane hit the carrier and killed 
47 shipmates. But, last week, a T-2 Buckeye training jet crashed into the 
Lexington, killing the Navy pilot and four people on the flight deck. The 
accident bore an eerie similarity to the remembered wartime attack. As a crowd 
of 1,500 watched, sailors from two eras dropped wreaths during a weekend cruise 
in the Gulf of Mexico about 10 miles from where the trainer crash occurred.

Army investigators will decide this month whether a veteran said to have killed 
more than 500 Japanese soldiers during a single encounter in World War II was 
denied the Medal of Honor because he is Jewish, the New York Times reported. 
David Rubitsky, 72, a retired merchant seaman who lives in Wisconsin, and his 
supporters say that the veteran, armed only with a machine gun, a carbine and 
an automatic rifle, cut down 500 to 600 enemy troops in New Guinea in December, 
1942. The New York Times said that two of Rubitsky's superiors recommended him 
for the Medal of Honor but a third rejected the idea because Rubitsky is 
Jewish. The paper said that an important piece of evidence is a handwritten 
message from a Japanese officer who said he elected to commit suicide for his 
role in a battle in which "600 fine Japanese soldiers died because of a 
solitary American soldier."

Allegations of waste and lax security at Folsom State Prison leveled by 
correctional officers working at the Sacramento-area facility will be 
investigated, state Sen. Robert Presley (R-Riverside) said. He said the staff 
of his Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations will review 
Folsom's operations. Guards have complained that inmates are allowed access to 
ingredients to make an alcoholic home brew. They also reported that prisoners 
have thrown away food, clothing and usable equipment -- including computers -- 
on a scrap bin.

Visitors to Death Valley National Monument have been warned to stay away from 
wild animals because of the danger of rabies. State Health Director Kenneth 
Kizer said visitors to the monument after Oct. 9 may have been infected with 
rabies if they came in contact with infected foxes, coyotes, bats and other 
meat-eating wild or domestic animals. "One person has been bitten by a rabid 
fox at Stovepipe Wells," Kizer said. "Other foxes from the monument are being 
tested to determine if they are also infected." Pets left outside at night 
could be bitten by a rabies-infected animal and can incubate the disease for 
six months or longer. People who suspect they or their pet have been infected 
should contact local health officials, Kizer said. Infected dogs and cats with 
current vaccinations must be revaccinated and quarantined for 30 days. Pets 
without vaccinations must be quarantined for 6 months or destroyed.

CRIME: EX-WIFE OF THE 1987 BAR ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT WAS UNDER COURT ORDER TO 
STOP HARASSING HIS NEW FAMILY.

<P>
Daniel T. Broderick III, a well-known medical malpractice lawyer and doctor who 
formerly served as president of the San Diego County Bar Assn., and his wife 
were found shot to death Sunday morning in the upstairs master bedroom of their 
Hillcrest home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were discovered shortly before 7:30 a.m. by friends who forced their 
way into the home in the 1000 block of Cypress Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified a prime suspect in the shootings as the attorney's 
41-year-old ex-wife, Elizabeth Ann Broderick, whom local attorneys and friends 
of the victims said had mounted a steady harassment campaign against the couple 
that included ramming her car into their house, setting a fire in the home and 
taking personal items from inside their residence. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Elizabeth Broderick, accompanied by her attorney, surrendered at 
4:30 p.m. at downtown police headquarters, where she was being questioned late 
into the evening. She was booked Sunday night on suspicion of two counts of 
murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive appears to be related to (Daniel and Elizabeth) Broderick's 
previous marital breakup," said Lt. Gary Learn, a homicide investigator for the 
San Diego Police Department. "The investigation is continuing." 
</P>
<P>
The number of times the couple was shot was unclear Sunday night, Deputy 
Coroner Jack Larkie said, who added that autopsies were to be performed today. 
</P>
<P>
While police said the victims were apparently slain Sunday morning, it was not 
immediately known whether there was a struggle inside the home. However, police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said that "preliminary indicators are that they were 
surprised by" their attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, 44, was found lying on the floor. The body of 28-year-old 
Linda Broderick was lying across their bed. Both were fully clothed. 
</P>
<P>
News of the couple's death drew sharp, stunned responses from much of San 
Diego's legal community, particularly among attorneys who had practiced 
alongside Broderick and were familiar with his leadership in 1987 in the County 
Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just devastating," said Ned Huntington, who succeeded Broderick as 
president of the local bar. "I cried. I just cried. 
</P>
<P>
"It just breaks me up. And I know my reaction is going to be the same as many, 
many lawyers around town. This is a good friend of a lot of people. You lose 
somebody like this in the legal community, you can't ever replace him. And now 
we'll miss him terribly." 
</P>
<P>
John Seitman, who preceded Broderick in the top position with the county bar, 
said: "This is really tragic. I'm really shocked by this." 
</P>
<P>
Several attorneys, along with police, said that Broderick -- who received a law 
degree from Harvard and graduated from the Cornell University Medical College 
-- had been hounded by his ex-wife since their divorce in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
During the divorce, Daniel Broderick became engaged to Linda, whom he had met 
in 1983, and their recent marriage enraged his ex-wife, friends and fellow 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
In what they described as a "reverse 'Fatal Attraction' " situation, the 
ex-wife continually bothered Broderick and his new bride, even to the point 
that a security guard was hired and court orders were obtained to protect them 
from her harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Dave Cohen, another police spokesmen, said authorities received a 
call shortly before 7:30 a.m. advising them to check the welfare of Daniel and 
Linda Broderick. As officers arrived, they said, they spotted some people 
coming out of the two-story, brick Colonial-style home. 
</P>
<P>
The people leaving the house told police that they too had been called to check 
on the Brodericks. 
</P>
<P>
"Those folks were forced to break through a screen window on the ground floor 
to get inside the residence, and they subsequently found the bodies," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the bodies were discovered, police issued an all-points bulletin for 
Elizabeth Broderick. Her 1987 Chevrolet was found later in the day in Pacific 
Beach, and the bulletin was canceled when she surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington, who said he has known Daniel Broderick through both marriages, said 
the ex-wife often was inside the home, normally to visit her and Daniel 
Broderick's four children. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, while Daniel Broderick did not appreciate the harassment she 
brought to his new life with Linda, he also tried not to be too harsh on her 
because she was the mother of his four children, of whom he had custody. 
</P>
<P>
"It had gone on so long that Daniel just adjusted to her craziness," Huntington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Daniel Broderick did try to keep his ex-wife away. He 
said Broderick obtained a court order to protect him and his new wife from 
Elizabeth's taunts. And he said Broderick hired a security guard to trail the 
ex-wife on his wedding day with Linda, to make sure that the new couple were 
not bothered when they exchanged vows in a private ceremony at their Hillcrest 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, attorneys and friends of the victims said, the ex-wife was persistent. 
</P>
<P>
They said she once rammed her car into Daniel Broderick's living-room window. 
There were obscene phone calls, they said. Although she missed their wedding, 
she soon afterward found a job with the wedding photographer and, Huntington 
said, "she saw their wedding pictures before they even saw their wedding 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Elizabeth Broderick sometimes visited the home on Cypress 
Avenue and was suspected of taking personal items. "She stole their wedding 
(guest) list right before they got married," he said. 
</P>
<P>
C. Logan McKechnie, another local attorney, said that, when a fire broke out in 
Daniel Broderick's home, his ex-wife, who was known to be "somewhat 
vindictive," was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Yet friends and attorneys also said that, despite his personal problems, Daniel 
Broderick maintained an active and successful law career, blending his degrees 
in medicine and the law to become an expert in medical malpractice cases. He 
was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"He would not pursue a frivolous claim," Seitman said. "If it was a good claim, 
he was an absolutely brilliant lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Grimes, another attorney and close friend of Daniel Broderick, described 
him as "an excellent, well-liked and much-admired person." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the victims) were a well-liked and friendly couple," Grimes said. "In 
every way you could rate someone -- skill, honesty, ethics -- he had the 
highest reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career, Broderick handled many high-profile legal cases in San 
Diego. He represented the late Monte Kobey, the San Diego Swap Meet czar, 
against two medical organizations after Kobey was afflicted with the AIDS virus 
from a blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
He also successfully sued a man for sexually molesting his 10-year-old daughter 
in a case that ended in July in a jury award of $1.25 million in compensatory 
and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an excellent lawyer," Seitman said. "He was a terribly bright person."

SANTA CLARITA RENT-CONTROL ISSUE STILL SMOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A movement to limit rent increases at mobile home parks in Santa Clarita failed 
to win support from the City Council last week but may bring concessions from 
park owners eager to avoid regulation, an industry expert said. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, there would be a tendency to moderate rent increases because of 
the threat of rent control," said David Evans, regional director of the Western 
Mobilehome Assn., a statewide trade group for park owners. "They might raise 
rents 5% instead of 8%." 
</P>
<P>
George Kahabka, general partner in Polynesian Mobile Home Park, agreed: "It's 
going to bring about a mood of restraint." 
</P>
<P>
About 60 residents of mobile home parks appeared at a City Council meeting 
Tuesday to support a rent-stabilization ordinance. It would tie rent increases 
to rises in the consumer price index but limit them to a maximum of 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Council members opted for a cooperative approach instead. They invited both 
sides to a December meeting, where they hope to reach an agreement on voluntary 
guidelines. But they warned park owners that they would come down hard if rents 
started to soar. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives of both camps have retreated to their respective 
corners to plan strategy. Park tenants -- many of them elderly and dependent on 
Social Security -- complain about rent increases that they say average between 
8% and 10% a year, but have gone as high as 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Mobile Home Owners Area Council, which represents park 
residents, is collecting data about rent increases at the 22 parks in the city 
and will compare those figures with increases in the consumer price index, 
which has hovered around 5% in recent years. Members hope that their findings 
will be so persuasive that the City Council will adopt a rent-control ordinance 
even though it was reluctant to do so last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,200 spaces in Santa Clarita parks are home to more than 7,500 people 
paying rents of between $300 and $473 a month, said Don Wilder, president of 
the mobile home group. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Jeannette and Franklin Story, both in their 80s, who live on a 
fixed income and are just getting by. Their rent at Mulberry Mobilhome Park has 
just gone up 6.5% to $280.87 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living on our Social Security, and we've had four hospital bills since 
last December," Jeannette Story said. "The prices of things now, and our 
hospital bills, it's outrageous. We don't go to picture shows. We don't do 
anything. We don't spend money foolishly. 
</P>
<P>
"If it keeps going much higher," she said of the rent, "well, I don't know what 
we'll do." 
</P>
<P>
Thea Wilson lives at West Green Brier park, where rent has increased 8% a year 
in the past two years. She pays $473 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I work, it's a problem," she said. "I don't get a raise of 8% a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens at the park have been particularly hard hit, she said. "They 
are scared. They are facing, at the age of 60 or 65, the fact that in two 
years, they can't afford to live here." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue are park owners, who say they are entitled to a 
fair return on their investments. Without a fair return, neither side benefits, 
Kahabka said. "Either you liquidate or things start falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
Kahabka advocates negotiating long-term leases with residents, a system he has 
used at a park outside Los Angeles County. He said nine months of bargaining 
with park tenants produced a five-year lease that ties rent increases to 
inflation but requires residents to absorb the cost of new government taxes for 
such things as roads. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said several parks in Santa Clarita use long-term leases that specify the 
amount of annual rent hikes. "Some leases, which residents willingly signed, 
have increases above the CPI," Evans said. "At Green Brier, the annual 
increases are 8%. My response is, 'You knew when you signed the lease what the 
increase will be, so why are you complaining?' If the CPI were 10%, the park 
owner would be locked into 8% and the residents wouldn't be complaining. When 
they signed the lease, both sides took a risk." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who advises park owners in an eight-county area from Los Angeles to 
Fresno, has scheduled a meeting Nov. 16 to assess how much rents have increased 
in Santa Clarita and why. That information will be forwarded to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance proposed for Santa Clarita is patterned after one in Oceanside. 
The city of Los Angeles also restricts rent increases at mobile homes, tying 
them to inflation.

MEDFLY SPRAYING PLANS PROMPT CALLS FROM CONCERNED RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County agriculture officials fielded about 30 calls Sunday from 
northeast San Fernando Valley residents concerned about plans to spray a 
17-square-mile area with insecticide tonight. The spraying is intended to 
eradicate a recent infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
The insecticide malathion, which will be sprayed in very low concentrations, 
poses no health threat to humans, officials said. But they cautioned that 
automobile paint and outdoor fish ponds should be protected from the aerial 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are to begin spraying at 9 p.m., and will cover San Fernando, 
Sylmar and parts of Mission Hills, Granada Hills and Pacoima. The spraying is 
expected to end at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the mature Medflies, which lay their eggs in more than 260 varieties 
of vegetables and fruit, have been found within a few blocks of one another in 
Sylmar since Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The California Conservation Corps will distribute leaflets about the spraying 
to residents of the area beginning at 6 a.m. today.

PROST REFUSES TO RACE BUT STILL WINS GRAND PRIX WORLD TITLE

ADELAIDE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thierry Boutsen of Belgium won the rain-soaked Australian Grand Prix Sunday, 
but Alain Prost of France clinched the 1989 world drivers' championship while 
sitting in the pits after refusing to race in the treacherous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have waited longer to start the race," Prost said. "I simply 
thought the conditions were too dangerous. You've only got one life." 
</P>
<P>
Prost's McLaren-Honda teammate, defending world champion Ayrton Senna of 
Brazil, lost his final chance of winning the crown when he crashed into the 
rear of a Brabham-Judd driven by Briton Martin Brundle. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on the 14th lap after pole sitter Senna had driven 
sensationally to lead the field by about 25 seconds. Senna's left front wheel 
was completely ripped from the car in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Senna needed to win at Adelaide, and to win a court appeal against his 
disqualification after winning the Oct. 22 Japanese Grand Prix, in order to 
prevent Prost adding to the world titles he won in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
His court appeal now is academic. 
</P>
<P>
Boutsen, driving a Williams-Renault, scored his second Formula One victory of 
the year in the final race of the season. The race was scheduled for 81 laps, 
but stopped after 70 when the two-hour time limit was exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Alessandro Nannini finished second in a Benetton-Ford, 28.658 seconds 
behind Boutsen, with Riccardo Patrese of Italy third in the second 
Williams-Renault.

FOOTNOTES: HOLY MAGAZINE COVER! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No sooner had Time Inc. announced merger plans with Warner Communications last 
spring than the debate began on whether the alliance would compromise Time's 
journalistic integrity. Would Time's magazines start promoting Warner Bros. 
movies? Time magazine itself wondered last March. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's top brass have insisted not, but the issue may not be dead. At a 
meeting with Columbia University journalism students last week, Time Warner 
President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. got a heated interrogation from a former 
Money magazine staffer about why Money's November issue carries a cover photo 
of the Joker, the villain played by Jack Nicholson in Warner Bros.' "Batman." 
The illustration is for a story about choosing the best financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas, looking uncomfortable, said he knew nothing of the cover before it 
was printed and insisted that the choice belonged to Money managing editor 
Frank Lalli. "Do you want somebody at the top of the company to play God?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I only think the company has to be very sensitive to these issues," said the 
questioner, Susan Macovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Pass, Punt, Run -- and Read 
</P>
<P>
Does Bo know books? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bo Jackson is one of the Raiders whose face didn't make it on a 
special set of promotional bookmarks created by Pacific Sports Productions of 
Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, they weren't sure if Bo was going to play," explained Mike Bone, 
executive vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
You can't buy the sets of 12 bookmarks -- which are being underwritten by 
Knudsen dairies. But the bookmarks -- each featuring one LA Raider -- are free 
at more than 200 libraries around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose, of course, is to get kids to read. On the back of each are several 
suggested books by the football players. Some are a bit weird, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
For example, defensive end Scott Davis seems to recommend the most unusual book 
of all: "How to Eat Fried Worms" by Thomas Rockwell. The marker describes the 
book this way: "a hilarious story about how Billy wins a bet by eating 15 worms 
in one day." 
</P>
<P>
Relief on the Big Screen 
</P>
<P>
As commercials go, the ad for Century City Hospital's back treatment program 
seen in recent months at the AMC theaters in Century City wasn't much of a 
production. But it apparently was effective. 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine Modern Healthcare, 25% to 30% of inquiries each month 
about the hospital's program were generated by the ads. Patrons saw the words 
"Back Again" on the screen along with a picture of a man gripping his back in 
agony. The remainder of the text referred viewers to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, owned by Los Angeles-based National Medical Enterprises, paid the 
14-theater complex $4,800 to flash the color slide twice before every screening 
over a four-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The idea seems to be contagious. Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood 
contracted with the theater last month to show a slide promoting its drug 
dependency treatment program.

WORLD-RENOWNED PIANIST VLADIMIR HOROWITZ DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Vladimir Horowitz, whose brilliant technique and emotional profundity led many 
to consider him the 20th Century's greatest pianist, died Sunday at his 
townhouse on New York City's Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, 85, suffered a heart attack about 12:30 p.m., said his manager, Peter 
Gelb. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he died of some sort of massive, major heart attack," Gelb said, 
noting that details would have to come from medical officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Horowitz was undoubtedly the greatest pianist of the 20th Century," said Glenn 
Plaskin, author of "Horowitz," a critical biography published in 1983. "He had 
more physical energy, more electricity, than any musician that came onto that 
platform. He was the Greta Garbo of the concert stage." 
</P>
<P>
His last concerts were in western Europe in 1987, Gelb said. He had a studio at 
his home, and shortly before his death he had been at work on a recording of 
Haydn, Mozart and Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were uncertain. But Horowitz's wife, Wanda, daughter of 
the late conductor Arturo Toscanini, is believed to want her husband buried in 
the Toscanini family burial plot in Milan, Italy, Gelb said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life, Horowitz was renowned for his erratic behavior, Plaskin 
said, calling him "temperamental, demanding and a perfectionist. He was 
extremely charming. He would have loved the attention he's getting now." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz influenced generations of pianists and other musicians, said violinist 
Shlomo Mintz, adding: "The last of the tradition of great pianism has passed 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Artur Rubinstein never forgot having heard Horowitz play for the first 
time in the 1920s. In his autobiography, Rubinstein wrote that the performance 
"was much more than sheer brilliance and technique; there was also an easy 
elegance -- the magic something which defies description." 
</P>
<P>
For more than 50 years, Horowitz's records were bestsellers, and he won a score 
of Grammy awards for best classical recordings. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1982 interview, he said recordings had made modern audiences better than 
those of earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past the public did not understand music," he said. "But now, through 
records, cassettes, they know so much, you no longer have to exaggerate. My 
playing has become simpler, and simplicity is wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Of audience appreciation, Horowitz said: "It's the silence that matters, not 
the applause. Anyone can have applause. But the silence, before and during the 
playing -- that is everything." 
</P>
<P>
Especially noted for his dynamic interpretations of such composers as Liszt, 
Rachmaninoff and Chopin, Horowitz's fees for a performance -- as much as 80% of 
the gross -- were a tribute to his genius. 
</P>
<P>
His televised performances enabled him to be seen and heard by more people in 
the last decade of his life than in all the previous years during which he 
graced the concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Kiev, Russia, on Oct. 1, 1904, Horowitz was the youngest of four 
children of Simeon and Sophie Horowitz, whose first house was fortuitously 
located on Music Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Approach 
</P>
<P>
From the age of 5, after he had already studied piano with his mother for two 
years, Horowitz dazzled and dismayed critics and patrons alike with his 
freewheeling, dramatic interpretations of composers old and new. 
</P>
<P>
And if he was not always true to the score, he consistently was true to his 
lifelong maxim -- to "make a percussive instrument sing." 
</P>
<P>
His parents appreciated their son's talent but did not raise him as a musical 
prodigy. They wanted him to become an educated man. 
</P>
<P>
At age 12, he was sent to high school as well as the Kiev Music Conservatory, 
where he studied composition and piano under Felix Blumenfeld, who had studied 
under Anton Rubinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz initially wanted to be a composer, learning the repertoire of all 
instruments and memorizing operas. He wrote for voice and piano and was deep in 
his studies when the Bolshevik Revolution convulsed Russia in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution -- which cost his parents their home -- was the "accident" that 
made him a concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
"With my own eyes I saw them throw our piano through the window," he told an 
interviewer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He gave a series of concerts in Khartov in 1922 to earn money to support his 
family. This led to a tour of the Soviet Union in 1924, and a year later he was 
allowed to leave the country to "study" abroad. 
</P>
<P>
His first recitals were in Berlin, and word of his talent spread quickly 
throughout Europe. He played for royalty in a triumphant tour of European 
capitals and left audiences gasping for new adjectives in nearly every major 
European concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
He came to America in 1928 and appeared with the New York Philharmonic under 
the baton of Sir Thomas Beecham, who was also making his U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to upstage the maestro, Horowitz chose Tchaikovsky's B-Minor 
Concerto. He later recalled that he "played louder, faster and more notes than 
Tchaikovsky wrote." 
</P>
<P>
He finished several bars ahead of the orchestra, leading critic Olin Downes to 
note: "The call of the wild is heard whether it is a savage beating a drum or a 
young Russian, mad with excitement, physical speed and power, pounding on a 
keyboard." 
</P>
<P>
After Horowitz brilliantly played Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto at a later 
concert, the composer put to rest any questions about Horowitz's genius, 
saying: "He swallowed it whole." 
</P>
<P>
Rachmaninoff's tribute was all the more significant because it came at a time 
when Josef Lhevinne, Josef Hoffman, Benno Moiseiwitsch and Rachmaninoff himself 
-- all giants in an era of keyboard geniuses -- were performing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Horowitz met Toscanini, who was then leading the New York Philharmonic 
in a cycle of Beethoven concerts. The maestro Toscanini chose Horowitz as 
soloist for the Emperor Concerto. Horowitz chose Toscanini's daughter, Wanda, 
as his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"She made a man out of me, and her father made me a musician," Horowitz said 
years after their wedding. "I began to play more straight." 
</P>
<P>
But Toscanini also gave the young Horowitz this "unstraight" advice: "If you 
want to please only the critics, don't play too loud, too soft, too fast, too 
slow." 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter he became both impressionist and entertainer, with an accent on the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935 Horowitz gave nearly 100 recitals. The resulting fatigue -- coupled 
with a difficult appendectomy -- sent him into seclusion in France and 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
What he had been doing, he said when he emerged in 1938, was studying. 
</P>
<P>
By 1940 he had returned to an enthusiastic reception at his favored Carnegie 
Hall and in 1943, in a single concert with Toscanini, raised $11 million in war 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
His mysterious absences from the concert stage, which have lasted as long as 12 
years, and his spur-of-the-moment decisions about where and when he will play 
or record a piece contributed to his popularity and legend. 
</P>
<P>
In six decades, Horowitz had four periods when he gave up public concerts: from 
1935-38, 1953-65, 1969-72 and 1983-85. The reasons for his absences varied but 
were usually related to some form of exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
After his first hiatus in the 1930s, Horowitz said, "I was at the point where I 
played certain works so often that I couldn't hear them anymore, even while my 
fingers were performing them." 
</P>
<P>
A Return at 81 
</P>
<P>
When he left the Soviet Union in 1925, ostensibly to study abroad, Horowitz 
vowed never to return. In early 1986, at age 81, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I die, I want to see the country where I was born," he said. "But I 
didn't want to go home as a tourist. I want to play." 
</P>
<P>
His two concerts in Moscow and Leningrad in April, 1986, were triumphs. About 
2,000 music lovers jammed Moscow's Conservatory of Music to hear the master's 
first concert in the Soviet Union in 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more braved a cold rain outside the conservatory in the hope of 
getting a spare ticket or even a glimpse of the Russian-born pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Between pieces, Horowitz delighted the Moscow audience with his antics, 
pointing and waving at friends, blowing kisses to the crowd, sniffing 
carnations and sticking his tongue out at television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Horowitz, seemingly unmoved by the eight-minute standing 
ovation, firmly closed his piano and shooed the audience out. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop clapping . . . Go home," he said in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
The recording "Horowitz in Moscow" won a Grammy in 1988, a year in which he 
also won a Grammy for his special contribution to music. 
</P>
<P>
He was on the cover of Time magazine the following week and later was given the 
Medal of Freedom for his "pilgrimage of peace" by President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1944 Horowitz became an American citizen and an avid baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
And he could afford any seat in the ballpark. He now was the highest-paid 
concert artist in the country, if not the world. 
</P>
<P>
His fee had become up to 80% of the house. Toward the end of his career these 
percentages were earning him $50,000 and more per concert. 
</P>
<P>
His eccentricities were becoming as famous as his performances. 
</P>
<P>
The concerts were scheduled only on Sundays and started precisely at 4 p.m. so 
the maestro could take a nap both before and after a performance with time left 
in the evening for a leisurely dinner of chicken. (It was always chicken for 
breakfast and dinner and a small plate of frozen gray sole for lunch.) 
</P>
<P>
He drank nothing alcoholic and, until he abandoned the habit completely very 
late in life, smoked sparingly ("six cigarettes only a day," he told one 
interviewer. "You see how disciplined I am?") 
</P>
<P>
In 1953 he celebrated the 25th anniversary of his U.S. debut at Carnegie Hall, 
repeating the Tchaikovsky concerto he had played in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
"His technique is no longer an end in itself (for) he has transformed himself 
from a fire-eating virtuoso into a self-critical, searching artist," Howard 
Taubman wrote in the New York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He was soon to disappear again, this time for 12 years. He reappeared in an 
interview with High Fidelity Magazine in which he blamed his latest hiatus on a 
nervous stomach, the exhaustion of travel and a growing malaise he was 
encountering in preparing for each performance. 
</P>
<P>
The years had not been spent in total silence, however. 
</P>
<P>
He won Grammy awards in 1962, '63, '64 and '65, making him the first classical 
performer ever to be so honored in four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he returned to the concert stage as a result of recording in a studio 
in an old church. In an effort to improve the acoustics for the recordings, he 
suggested that the sessions be moved to Carnegie Hall. When he showed up there 
to practice, rumors spread that he was preparing a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Whether his motive was to appease the rumormongers or to make himself known to 
a new generation is not clear, but he returned to the concert stage May 9, 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
Music critic Harold C. Schonberg found the "new" Horowitz "less interested in 
detail, more interested in the long line, the structure of a piece, a 
consecutive musical flow." 
</P>
<P>
The concert was recorded live and retains several wrong notes, which Horowitz 
dismissed as "adding a human quality." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz limited his concerts to areas where he could travel by car or train, 
remaining near his New York home, and maintain his diet and sleeping habits. 
Despite those precautions, he contracted a serious cold in 1969 and returned to 
seclusion for three more years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1972 he was again playing in public, alternating among major cities, college 
campuses and an occasional community auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his American debut, he 
performed at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic -- his first 
performance with an orchestra in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Said Horowitz of conductor Eugene Ormandy: "We will understand each other." 
</P>
<P>
Taking Liberties 
</P>
<P>
The music was Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto, the work the composer had 
said Horowitz "swallowed whole" many years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz took his usual liberties with the score and received his usual 
ovations from crowd and critic. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter he was seen occasionally at the concerts of others. In the 
perfunctory interviews that seemed to accompany each of his recitals (he had by 
now abandoned concerts) he would single out young regional talent for praise -- 
unless, of course, they played as someone else said they should, neither too 
loud nor too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Played percussively, the piano is a bore," he told one interviewer. "If I go 
to a concert and someone plays like that, I have two choices: to go home or to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
He gradually reduced his own recitals to fewer than a dozen a year, but now 
there were no mysteries surrounding the infrequent appearances -- only an old 
man betrayed by an aging body that somehow found new life for his Moscow and 
Leningrad concerts and the European concerts that followed the Geneva summit 
and the 1986 U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange accords. 
</P>
<P>
"He's unique and probably he is often wrong," violinist Nathan Milstein once 
said of his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't say Niagara Falls is wrong." 
</P>

QUAKE EXPOSED NEED FOR BETTER TRANSIT SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TROMBLEY and FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As state and local officials searched for lessons to be learned from the Bay 
Area earthquake, one stood out with stark clarity: California needs to develop 
a balanced transportation system and not continue to be almost completely 
dependent on the automobile. "Roads are what we know," said Robert K. Best, 
Caltrans director. "We really do have to start emphasizing things we don't know 
so well" -- like trains, express buses and mass transit lines. 
</P>
<P>
With the Oakland Bay Bridge closed, a portion of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed 
and other sections of the Bay Area highway and freeway system damaged, trains, 
ferries and the Bay Area Rapid Transit system are "crucial to keeping the Bay 
Area functioning," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
BART, which has been carrying more than 300,000 riders a day, almost 100,000 
more than in pre-earthquake times, "wasn't designed to be an emergency 
transportation system but that's the way it has been functioning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned that during a major earthquake, highways fall down and transit 
keeps going," said Rod Diridon, chairman of the Santa Clara County Board of 
Supervisors. "So it makes pretty good sense to put more of our money into 
transit." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the urgent need to develop balanced transportation systems, state and 
local agencies drew other lessons from the quake, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rehabilitation or replacement of unreinforced masonry buildings must be 
speeded up, because many of these structures collapsed, killing and injuring 
scores of people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The emergency flood plan of the State Department of Water Resources, which 
watches over California's elaborate system of dams, levees and aqueducts, must 
be retooled to better handle non-flood emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake also has raised anew the broader issue of growth control. 
</P>
<P>
Should California continue its current approach to growth, allowing new 
development to push into remote areas of the state that require enormous 
investments in roads, sewers, water facilities and other infrastructure? Or 
should there be a state plan, or a series of regional plans, directing growth 
into areas where services already exist? 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, transportation is an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Best said the state and federal governments cannot afford to provide all the 
freeways and highways that are needed to develop the Inland Empire or the 
undeveloped parts of Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
"There are options out there that are better than what we built 50 or 60 or 70 
years ago and we need to look at them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Best's call for a balanced transportation system struck some observers as 
ironic, because his boss, Gov. George Deukmejian, blasted the last Caltrans 
director who stressed that approach -- Adriana Gianturco, who ran the 
transportation agency for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Mass Transit Promoted 
</P>
<P>
In the early Deukmejian years, Caltrans concentrated on road-building and 
repair, but, since Best's appointment in early 1988, the agency has been 
promoting intercity train service, high-speed buses on HOV (High-Occupancy 
Vehicle) lanes and light rail lines, as well as highway construction. The 
earthquake experience is expected to add momentum to that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Several transportation officials predicted that money would be shifted from new 
highway and freeway construction to the repair and upgrading of existing roads. 
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that rehabilitation will be funded on a priority schedule," said 
Robert Remen, executive director of the California Transportation Commission, 
which decides how much money will be spent on what projects. 
</P>
<P>
But Remen said it is premature to say what priorities might be changed in the 
commission's five-year transportation construction plan. 
</P>
<P>
Much depends on how far the $1 billion in emergency federal highway funds 
approved by Congress and President Bush will stretch and how much emergency 
repair money the governor and the Legislature decide to spend. The Legislature 
has approved a quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax for relief to 
victims of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) said the 24 transit agencies in 
the Bay Area failed to cooperate well after the earthquake and that he will 
introduce legislation to consolidate some of those agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Best said "it would be really nice if people could buy one ticket that would 
let them ride anything" in the Bay Area but that few transfer systems exist 
among the various bus and rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kopp warned that efforts to merge transit agencies "will be a long 
march" because "all those people are very independent and they don't want to 
give up their offices." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp also said he hopes the earthquake experience would provide the needed push 
for another San Francisco Bay crossing, either a bridge or a tunnel, south of 
the Oakland Bay Bridge and north of the Richmond-San Mateo Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Orman, director of the Greenbelt Alliance, an environmental group, said a 
clear lesson from the earthquake is that "San Francisco needs a major ferry 
system," connecting the city to the East Bay and to Marin County. Some analysts 
believe the earthquake will provide a boost for regional planning, because some 
cities, counties and other governmental entities failed to cooperate in the 
aftermath of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Others think the crisis will focus attention on growth, with the possibility 
that government will play a more active role in guiding new development into 
areas that already have adequate roads, sewers and water works rather than to 
open spaces that lack such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a broad debate about how the Bay Area develops, about housing 
and open space, jobs and development," predicted Larry Orman of the Greenbelt 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this debate will take place in the deliberations of a blue-ribbon group 
called Bay Vision 2020, which will engage in the same kind of planning process 
that led to the Los Angeles 2000 report. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Bodovitz, president of the California Environmental Trust, said he hoped 
for such a debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Will this lead to more pressure for urban sprawl?" Bodovitz asked. "Will 
people see that as the way to escape" future earthquake damage? "Or will there 
be greater attention to the availability of roads, water, landfill space and 
other infrastructure needs" before new developments are approved by local 
governing bodies? 
</P>
<P>
Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, said the earthquake provides "an opportunity to bring back to the 
table the issue of just how much at the margin our infrastructure is operating" 
and how much needs to be done to rebuild it if life in California is to be 
sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
State water officials generally were pleased with the way California's 
elaborate system of dams, levees and aqueducts held up. 
</P>
<P>
Four small dams in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties were damaged but both 
the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project survived intact. Damage 
to the vast levee system in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta was light. 
</P>
<P>
"There were predictions that an earthquake of this magnitude would devastate 
the system," said Edward Huntley, chief of planning for the State Department of 
Water Resources. "Fortunately, it did not." 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' flood control experts said the water 
level in Folsom Lake, a large reservoir on the American River above Sacramento, 
might have to be kept low because of fear that an auxiliary dam could fail in a 
future quake. 
</P>
<P>
Levees Examined 
</P>
<P>
Also, engineers from the Metropolitan Water District, which supplies much of 
Southern California's water, flew to Northern California to survey the aged 
peat and sand levees. A major break in those levees could easily cause salt 
water to flow into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in such large quantities 
that its water would be unusable either for San Joaquin Valley agriculture or 
for Southern California drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state's major water works survived, local distribution systems in 
Santa Cruz and a few other cities were heavily damaged, causing disruption of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do much good to have a six-month supply of water in the reservoirs 
if you can't move it through the mains," a Metropolitan Water District official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Coe, chief of flood operations in the State Department of Water Resources, 
said most of that agency's emergency procedures worked well but there was some 
confusion about who was responsible for what in this "non-flood emergency." 
</P>
<P>
The quake will not lead state and local officials to seek major building code 
changes because the things that happened were expected: high-rise structures 
swayed but did not collapse, while unreinforced masonry buildings did collapse, 
sometimes with devastating consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is that we have a pretty good code," said Warren O'Brien, general 
manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. "After each 
quake, we generally improve the code. This quake didn't identify any (new) 
problems.' 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Los Angeles has pushed to bring older buildings, particularly 
the remaining 1,500 unreinforced masonry structures, up to current earthquake 
safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Mayor Tom Bradley and State Senate President Pro Tem David 
A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) have called for a ballot proposition to provide $90 
million in loans to help bring masonry apartment buildings -- most of them in 
low-income neighborhoods -- up to code. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina urged passage of a city ordinance that would 
allow tenants in unreinforced masonry buildings to place their rents in an 
escrow account. The money would be used to pay for the renovations if landlords 
refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Democratic legislators noted that Deukmejian vetoed a bill that 
would have allowed the formation of special assessment districts to bring 
private buildings up to current earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Cruz had requested the legislation so that owners of downtown 
buildings could afford to upgrade their structures. But the governor said this 
was an inappropriate use of the special assessment district concept. 
</P>
<P>
The district could not have been established in time to help the many downtown 
Santa Cruz buildings that collapsed in the quake, these legislators pointed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, we did not learn a lot new from this earthquake," said Michael J. 
Bocchicchio, the state architect. 
</P>
<P>
But Bocchicchio noted that several state buildings in Oakland and San Francisco 
were so badly damaged they had to be closed and said, "we need a mandated state 
program, with a lot more money, to bring these buildings up to code" at a 
faster rate. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials said the upgrading of classrooms to meet earthquake 
safety standards paid off because only eight out of 1,500 schools in the 
earthquake area suffered serious structural damage. Total cost of repairing 
school damage is estimated at $40 million to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs of UC buildings on the Berkeley, San Francisco and Santa Cruz campuses 
probably will run around $40 million, officials said, while damage to 
California State University System campuses is estimated at between $15 million 
and $45 million. 
</P>

Some education analysts believe a more important consequence of the earthquake 
may be increased pressure to rehabilitate campus buildings, instead of building 
the three new campuses UC wants, the six campuses being sought by CSU and the 
16 new campuses the community college system wants.

INFANT DEATH RATE HIGHEST AT KING HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles had the highest 
standardized death rate for newborn babies of all California hospitals in 1986, 
according to a sophisticated analysis of perinatal death-rate data by 
researchers at UC Santa Barbara, which is being made public today. 
</P>
<P>
King and three other Southern California hospitals with more than 600 
deliveries had significantly higher-than-expected perinatal death rates when 
compared to the statewide average, the report said. The other hospitals were 
County-USC Medical Center and California Medical Center in Los Angeles, and 
Humana Hospital-West Anaheim in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both King and County-USC acknowledged the accuracy of the figures, 
but said their facilities were overtaxed and underfunded in the areas of 
obstetrics and neonatal care. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for California Medical Center said the death rate reflected its 
high-risk patient population and an official at Humana Hospital-West Anaheim 
described the figure as a statistical abnormality. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Southern California hospitals, including AMI Tarzana Regional Medical 
Center, the U.S. Naval Hospital in San Diego, Riverside General Hospital and 
White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angles, had significantly low standardized 
perinatal death rates in 1986, the most recent year for which complete 
information is available. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Santa Barbara "Maternal and Child Health Data Base" is considered by 
many health care experts to be the best perinatal mortality information system 
in the United States. The data base is not an all-encompassing index that can 
be used to rank the overall performance hospitals in newborn care, according to 
Ronald L. Williams, the UC Santa Barbara health policy researcher who devised 
the measure. But for the most part, a lower-than-average adjusted death rate 
indicates better-than-average care. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the analysis is likely to continue the debate about the shortcomings 
of maternity and neonatal care at King and County-USC. The two large public 
hospitals deliver more babies than any other hospitals in the state and care 
for a disproportionate number of high-risk mothers and newborns. For more than 
a decade, they have had consistently high perinatal mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems clear that (County-USC and King) are having too many births for their 
facilities," said Frank P. Rust of UC Santa Barbara's Community and 
Organization Research Institute, the project coordinator for the report. 
</P>
<P>
"High-risk patients need the best care that medical science can provide," the 
UC Santa Barbara researchers said in written comments on King's data that were 
made available to The Times. "It is unclear if these kinds of services can be 
provided in what appears to be an overcrowded and understaffed facility." 
</P>
<P>
They added: "We believe that of the babies born at King/Drew that die, most 
would have died even had they been born at another hospital. However, our data 
also suggest that some of the babies born at King/Drew that did die would not 
have died if born in a hospital providing more effective perinatal care." 
</P>
<P>
Obstetrical and newborn care at county hospitals "has been of major concern to 
us," said Robert Gates, the director of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services. In recent years, the department has been financially 
responsible for about 25% of all births in the county, a percentage that is 
likely to continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the county wanted to "relieve the pressure on our own facilities" by 
sending more patients to private hospitals but was hampered by the "inadequacy 
of funding under the state Medi-Cal program." Some private hospitals, he said, 
are taking low-risk obstetric patients under Medi-Cal but are reluctant to 
accept high-risk patients because of inadequate reimbursement rates for 
additional care that might be required. 
</P>
<P>
The study looks at deaths from around the time of birth until the 28th day of 
life. While the death-rate data may reflect the ability of hospital physicians 
in promptly diagnosing and treating medical problems, they do not measure other 
important factors influencing long-term infant survival and well-being, such as 
prenatal care and inherited birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Differences among hospitals are most likely to be significant for mothers who 
are at high risk of delivering a sick or premature baby. Such mothers, 
including women who use intravenous drugs or receive inadequate prenatal care, 
may benefit most from the highest quality hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
According to the UC Santa Barbara statistics, County-USC had 17,088 births in 
1986 and 319 perinatal deaths. This was 61 more deaths than was predicted 
statistically, and on a standardized scale was 22.2% higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirement to deliver 17,000 or 18,000 births a year is unreal in terms 
of the resources that are made available to us," said Dr. Robert E. Tranquada, 
the dean of the USC Medical School. He cited the lack of space and the limited 
availability of nursing and anesthesia personnel. 
</P>
<P>
King had 8,121 births in 1986 and 138 perinatal deaths, according to the 
analysis. This was 43 more deaths than was predicted. 
</P>
<P>
King's perinatal death rate for 1986, when expressed on a standardized scale, 
was 37.7% higher than its expected death rate, the report said. In addition, 
between 1984 and 1986, the number of births increased by more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a series of articles in The Times detailed numerous patient-care 
and administrative deficiencies at King, and state and federal health officials 
cited the hospital for scores of deficiencies throughout the facility. County 
health officials have pledged to correct these problems by Dec. 21 in order to 
avoid a threatened cutoff of $60 million in public health care funding. 
</P>
<P>
In a written response to the report, Dr. Teiichiro Fukushima, the director of 
King's obstetrics management information system, said "this database report 
must be interpreted with caution" and "should not be used as a measure of 
hosital performance." 
</P>
<P>
Fukishima added: "It does show a rising perinatal moratlity rate in 1986 as 
compared to a decling trend in the preceeding years. This disturbing tendency . 
. . parallels the increasing rate of no care and drug-abusing patients." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Taeusch, the director of the division of neonatology at King, 
acknowledged that "quality of care" problems at the hospital contributed to 
King's unfavorable statistics. He said division estimates indicate that the 
neonatal mortality rate would remain "among the highest in the state" for both 
1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us angry that this seems to be such a surprise," Taeusch said in a 
telephone interview. "We want to get these problems solved. We feel underserved 
by the government agencies and the state and county legislators really 
responsible for us outside the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
While pointing out that the statistical analysis could "not fully account for 
the increased risk" of King's patients, Taeusch said the overall analysis was 
"probably among the best that are being done on a statewide or national scale." 
</P>
<P>
The 532-page Santa Barbara study, prepared under a contract from the state 
Department of Health Services by Williams, Rust, and Kam J. Rust, is designed 
to compare the mortality rate for individual hospitals to the statewide 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1986, the statewide average perinatal mortality rate declined 
from 11.6 deaths per 1,000 births to 9.8 deaths per 1,000 births, the report 
said. The number of births increased from 432,118 to 484,598. 
</P>
<P>
The report substantially improves upon the raw mortality data by 
"standardizing," or adjusting for factors that influence the perinatal death 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most important of these factors is the infant's birth weight; very 
low birth weight babies, those weighing fewer than 3.3 pounds, are about 130 
times more likely to die around the time of birth than babies of normal weight. 
</P>
<P>
The other factors are the sex and race of the baby, multiple births and the 
number of babies born at each institution. Together, these factors account for 
more than 80% of the variation in the raw mortality rates, the researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking all of these factors and the statewide average death rate into account, 
an expected perinatal death rate is calculated for each hospital, which is then 
compared to the hospital's actual death rate. If the actual rate significantly 
surpasses the expected rate, then the hospital is listed as having a high 
standardized death rate. 
</P>
<P>
The two other Southern California hospitals with high standardized perinatal 
death rates in 1986, California Medical Center in Los Angeles and Humana 
Hospital in Anaheim, did not have high death rates for newborns in earlier 
years, unlike County-USC and King. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for California Medical Center said the hospital's unfavorable 
statistics reflected its center-city location and its high-risk patient 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Humana Hospital in West Anaheim had 11 fetal deaths out of 954 births in 1986, 
compared to 4 fetal deaths out of 1,133 births in 1985 and two fetal deaths out 
of 611 deliveries in the first 10 months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
John Hanshaw, the hospital's executive director, said a case-by-case review 
indicated that all of the 11 fetal deaths in 1986 were "expected." The deaths 
included five cases where fetal death occurred before the mother reached the 
hospital and three anencephalic infants, who were born missing parts of the 
brain and skull. "It was just an abnormal statistical cluster," Hanshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
PERINATAL DEATHS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: 1986 
</P>
<P>
These Southern California hospitals had statistically significant high or low 
perinatal mortality rates as compared to the statewide average in 1986, 
according to an analysis of birth and death certificate data by the Community 
and Organization Research Institute at UC Santa Barbara. Perinatal deaths are 
those around the time of death or during the first 28 days of life. 
</P>
<P>
A computerized statistical analysis was used to "standardize" raw mortality 
data. It was designed to account for factors beyond the control of a hospital 
that influence the death rate, such as the infant's birth weight, sex, race and 
multiple births (twins for example). A standardized death rate of 100 
represents average performance. A value of more than 100 represents more deaths 
than expected, while a value of less than 100 represents fewer deaths than 
expected. For example, a value of 110 means that, on the average, for every 100 
deaths expected, 110 deaths occurred, or 10% more than would be expected on the 
basis of the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
There is a less than 5% probability that a hospital would be listed as having a 
high or low perinatal mortality rate because of chance variations in its death 
rate.

<P>
Bold type indicates hospitals that did not report birth weights for more than 
10% of their total neonatal deaths. As a result, the standardized death rates 
at these hospitals "may be artificially low," according to the UC Santa Barbara 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Births and deaths are listed under the hospital where the baby was born, even 
if the baby was subsequently transferred to another facility. Hospitals with 
fewer than 600 births or fewer than six expected perinatal deaths are not 
listed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the birthplace of the atomic bomb, the disappointments of the war on 
drugs have set scientific minds to turning. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of this stalemate, researchers say. Enough of slogging through jungles 
and sifting through cargo. They see a better way: a technological fix. 
</P>
<P>
The echoes are faint but inescapable. Fifty years after Albert Einstein urged 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt to begin the Manhattan Project, two scientists 
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory dispatched a letter this summer calling 
for a comparably intense drive against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Already one Los Alamos team has shifted its sights from Cold War to drug wars. 
Others may follow. And the ambitious proposals they are bouncing off 
well-guarded walls during months of brainstorming at this cloistered facility 
hint of major breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Munitions experts here talk of wreaking irreparable damage on the airstrips 
that are stepping stones in the cocaine chain. Physicists offer up lasers as 
eyes that could uncover fumes from drug laboratories hidden in jungles or 
anywhere else. Biologists recommend sophisticated bacteria that would remove 
the psychoactive powers from the global coca crop. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities under discussion include isotope fertilizers that would 
impregnate illicit crops with easily detectable radioactivity, stun guns that 
would disable car and plane engines, and supercomputers that would track the 
flow of drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology," the Los Alamos team declared, "can have major leverage." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamos proposal is the most ambitious under consideration, although by 
no means the only one. Government scientists across the country have set their 
sights on new weapons for counter-drug missions. 
</P>
<P>
But, with new ideas flooding into the agencies that combat drugs, skeptics are 
beginning to voice misgivings. They warn that some proposals represent 
"solutions waiting for problems" and that others reflect a bid for abundant 
drug-fighting dollars in an era of Pentagon constraint. 
</P>
<P>
That charged atmosphere presents a dilemma for an Administration eager to score 
points in the drug war. From a dizzying array of innovative ideas, officials 
are seeking to settle on anti-drug solutions that work. And the drawing-board 
sketches available so far might depict either miracle weapon or costly dead 
end. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is well and good," one official said. "But at some point we'll have 
to decide. Is the answer going to be Buck Rogers? Or do we really need more 
Dick Tracy?" 
</P>
<P>
The technological starting point, experts say, is unimpressive. Past research 
has produced drug-sniffing dogs, mirrors on poles and high-resolution 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
But the government still has very little success in ferreting out the smuggled 
cocaine that crosses U.S. borders by land and sea. South American processing 
laboratories lie mostly undetectable beneath triple-canopy jungles. And 
trafficking operations themselves remain difficult to track, leaving scarcely a 
fingerprint on the products they peddle. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly," said one expert in anti-drug technology, "just about everything has 
failed." 
</P>
<P>
The congressional Office of Technology Assessment two years ago blamed a 
"serious lack of support" for potential inventions. But most anti-drug 
initiatives have revolved around such stopgaps as deploying National Guardsmen 
to search cargo at U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not an American solution," entrepreneur Martin Anis, president of the 
Boston-based American Science and Engineering, groused. 
</P>
<P>
As the drug issue leaped to the top of the national agenda, Congress last year 
voted to establish eight federal laboratories to aid in the drug fight. William 
J. Bennett, who heads the war on drugs as director of the White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, advocated the "development of new technologies" 
for use against illegal drugs. He is expected to deliver to Congress by the end 
of the year a plan based on ideas developed at the eight national laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the Los Alamos delegation, Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine, 
the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the 
discussions last month in glowing terms. "Technology," he declared, "can make a 
contribution to stopping the flow of drugs into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"This field," an enthusiastic Democratic congressional official said, "is 
probably the clearest example you can find of progress requiring money." 
</P>
<P>
That technology-friendly spirit has left the government's 
research-and-development experts besieged -- and not only by the Los Alamos 
team. "Everyone thinks they've got a weapon that will shoot around corners," 
Washington consultant Neil Livingstone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress starts saying: 'Money for drugs,' and you immediately start hearing 
vendors talk about high technology," said John J. O'Neill, deputy assistant 
administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration for investigative support. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God," he added wearily, "for the American entrepreneurial spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The ideas, officials say, range from the beguiling to the absurd. Among the 
latter was a proposal to use trained gerbils to sniff out contraband drugs -- a 
"complete fiasco," Customs Service scientist William Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another came from an "accredited etymologist" who suggested that insects could 
do the job. Customs officials thought the idea promising but reconsidered when 
they thought of a potential obstacle: Nocturnal bugs might not work around the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciated the suggestion," Johnson said, "but we declined to be 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
On the rugged New Mexican mesas of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, two 
senior researchers last summer produced the 16-page draft white paper that 
quickly became fuel for fancy in some anti-drug circles. 
</P>
<P>
"New weapons," the scientists wrote in the "Role of Technology," which was 
distributed to the Senate Intelligence Committee and at least four federal 
agencies, are "badly needed in the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Although spare in language and detail, the July 24 paper conjured up images of 
stunning advances, such as isotope fertilizers to tag drug crops, laser 
spectroscopy to sniff out drug fumes and stun guns to attack cars and planes. 
</P>
<P>
A cover letter was dispatched to officials in Washington on Aug. 3, exactly 50 
years and one day after Einstein wrote to Roosevelt to urge "quick action" on 
experimental atomic research that was soon sited at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
With the expertise garnered since then from its role as the nation's atomic 
city, researchers Terry D. Bearce and John D. Immele wrote, Los Alamos was now 
well-placed to play a "major role in the counter-drug research and 
development." 
</P>
<P>
From their laboratory complex in the Jemez Mountains, the researchers refused 
to discuss their proposal with a reporter. A special assistant to the director 
of Los Alamos, William (Buck) Thompson, explained that the scientists believed 
it important to maintain "sensitivity" about the yet-unfunded proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Security is why a lot of federal agencies come to Los Alamos in the first 
place," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at other defense laboratories were similarly guarded. Even some who 
agreed to discuss their work asked that their names not be used. Now that their 
research is being focused on the drug wars, they feared retribution from its 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
But together, the researchers, government officials and experts in the field 
offered accounts of the technology drive now under way. 
</P>
<P>
One hope lies in proposals to penetrate the dense Andean jungles that shield 
cocaine processing pits from probing eyes. Even the best of U.S. satellite 
photography is often thwarted by forest canopies, experts say. But some 
researchers believe that high-tech sensors and lasers might zero in on telltale 
signs of drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can sniff out acetone and ether in the middle of the jungle, we will in 
effect have found one of the laboratories," said a senior 
</P>
<P>
chemist at the Aberdeen Weapons Center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The research at Aberdeen, supported by the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
illustrates a switch in focus. The vast Army facility was founded in 1917 to 
combat the threat posed by German use of gas in World War I, and it has 
concentrated on chemical warfare ever since. With the new anti-drug project, 
researchers hope to apply the lessons learned. 
</P>
<P>
The approach is modeled on new battlefield devices that use ion mobility 
spectrometry to sniff the air for chemical weapons. Already the researchers 
have found a way to reprogram a hand-held sensor to be alert instead to ether, 
acetone and other chemicals used in cocaine production. 
</P>
<P>
In time, the researchers hope to mount such sensors on drones or helicopters 
that might conduct airborne jungle sweeps. If current projections hold, the 
sensors would be 1,000 times more sensitive than the human nose in identifying 
traces of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos researchers see physics, not chemistry, as the means to the same 
end. The fumes that rise from jungle factories, they contend, can be detected 
by tunable lasers mounted aboard helicopters or aircraft. The plume would be 
detected by its "unique return after laser illumination." 
</P>
<P>
Other technologies under consideration aim at tracking any cocaine that escapes 
such airborne scrutiny. If the fertilizer fed to coca plants could be 
chemically doctored, the cocaine would forever bear an isotopic tag detectable 
at U.S. borders, the Los Alamos team suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers' hunt for chemical indicators derives from an abounding 
frustration with efforts to detect the drugs themselves. Because drugs are 
neither dense nor chemically volatile, they have proved invulnerable to most 
X-rays and sniffer devices. The Customs Service has made the search for a 
solution its top research priority. 
</P>
<P>
The tools under consideration range from biology to nuclear physics. The Naval 
Research Laboratory near Washington is injecting small animals with drugs in 
hopes of developing antibodies that would later serve as sensitive indicators 
of the presence of drugs. A three-man team at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory is using locally seized cocaine to experiment with new applications 
for vapor detectors built to sniff out bombs. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, Oak Ridge researcher Scott McLuckey acknowledged, "you've got to 
get the thing right up to it to smell anything." 
</P>
<P>
Those and other failures in drug detection have convinced many technologists 
that the prospects for breakthroughs lie in more aggressive approaches. One is 
called "soft kill." 
</P>
<P>
That idea, included in the Los Alamos white paper, proposes to disable 
traffickers or terrorists by bombarding their vehicles with microwaves or 
gases. Even in low concentrations, the paper says, such weapons directed at 
internal combustion engines could leave cars and planes powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Another would target coca or poppy plants themselves with pathogens far more 
effective than the defoliants now employed for crop eradication. The compounds, 
Los Alamos researchers believe, could prevent the plants from developing 
mind-altering power or stop them from growing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The team also offered expertise in developing air-drop devices that could halt 
traffic on dirt runways used by cocaine traffickers. Sketches included in the 
Los Alamos white paper showed odd-shaped metal-pronged tools that the 
researchers said would be "positive in their action against vehicles' tires." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the anti-drug agents, technology is two-sided. Cash-flush 
cocaine cartels have already developed communication systems that are in many 
ways superior to those of law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, a senior drug enforcement official said: "All this high 
technology sometimes doesn't do much good in labor-intensive countries." 
Low-wage peasants have thus far been an effective antidote to assaults on 
airstrips, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"We could blow one up on Tuesday," said the DEA's O'Neill, "and on Wednesday 
they'd be back with 1,000 campesinos to repair it in a day." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes salvation for the bad guys doesn't require even that much effort. 
A DEA attempt to track chemical shipments by attaching beepers to barrels ran 
aground once traffickers began to pour the acetone into five-gallon jugs. 
</P>
<P>
Another plan fell victim to a similar fate. After agents attached one too many 
transmitters to suspicious automobiles, traffickers found a foolproof way to 
search the undercarriage. "They'd take it to Jiffy Lube," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
That record aside, other wariness remains. Some wonder whether technologists' 
enthusiasm for the anti-drug effort has been motivated by dwindling federal 
support for more traditional defense projects. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos, for example, has seen its budget for Pentagon and intelligence 
projects plunge 13% in the last two years. In part to fill the void, noted Rep. 
Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, the 
laboratory is "aggressively trying to get into (the anti-drug) business." 
</P>
<P>
A laboratory official once complained to Richardson that Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace offensive "was the worst thing that ever happened 
to Los Alamos." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials worry that good ideas may be lost in the shuffle. 
The budget for research and development, some of which is classified, is known 
to be limited. And there is concern that misguided decisions might choke off 
promising proposals. 
</P>
<P>
To coordinate the effort, Congress and the Administration are nearing agreement 
on plans that would establish under a Drug Control Research and Development 
Committee a system for identifying worthy plans and determining appropriate 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people stand up and point to particular technologies, the more 
important we think it is to lay out a lot of plans first rather than get all 
carried away about particular gizmos," a senior congressional official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamos anti-drug proposal endorsed similar action, but with markedly 
more urgency. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to treat this with the same ingenuity as the problems of coming up 
with a major weapons system," Robert Kupperman, who was involved in the Los 
Alamos overture, said in an interview. "There are technologies to behold, and 
we don't really have the (research and development) to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
And from the white-coated researchers in the laboratories, a similar impatience 
exudes. 
</P>
<P>
What would set anti-drug ingenuity in gear, an Army chemist on the East Coast 
said, is "potentially something like the Manhattan Project." 
</P>
<P>
"We know what is out there," he said. "What we need is the license to do it 
quicker and faster and do it right now."

AMERICAN ALBUM: GEYSER GAZERS WHO WATCH OVER YELLOWSTONE'S NATURAL WONDERS 
CONSIDER IT A LABOR OF LOVE.

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day before the Park Service stopped plowing the roads for the season, 
Mary Ann Moss, watching where she stepped on the steaming rock shelf, scooped a 
handful of gravel and placed it, just so, at a hole in the stone near Giant 
Geyser. 
</P>
<P>
"Our high-tech markers," she said apologetically in her soft Indiana twang. At 
her next inspection, if the gravel is washed away, she will know some form of 
eruption has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
After all, she can't sit there in 20-degree weather, not counting the wind 
chill, day and night. This time of year, three hours at a stretch is hard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
As to the markers, Moss actually prefers pine needles to gravel. "I don't like 
the way it looks," she says of the small, virtually unnoticeable piles. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, 57, is a geyser gazer -- in official Park Service terms a "thermal 
volunteer," one of a couple dozen gentle souls who spend much of their summers 
surrounded by turquoise- and rust-colored pools and the nose-wrinkling smell of 
hydrogen sulfide. Their goal: to watch and measure the superheated fountains of 
the last great geyser field in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service has the budget to keep track of Old Faithful's activities, but 
not those of the more than 200 other active geysers. Geyser gazers provide the 
data for long-term research as well as for predictions of activity at 
lesser-known park attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Geysers are just so wonderful," said Moss, the last volunteer gazer in the 
park this year. "We want everyone to share them," she says with a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
One gazer, Herb Warren, 87, has come here from Denver for the last 30 years, 
getting up at 5 a.m. to keep track of Old Faithful in the hours before park 
naturalists begin their observations. He knows that some tourists will remember 
for the rest of their lives the spectacle of a dawn eruption, if he can help to 
tell them when to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Before his recent death, John Railey used to take the other shift in front of 
Old Faithful, from the closing hour of the visitors' center until midnight, so 
that tourists might learn of the opportunity to see an eruption by moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
And geyser gazers alert park naturalists when an irreverent visitor tosses a 
log into a boiling pool. 
</P>
<P>
"They're our eyes in the geyser basins," said Rick Hutchinson, Park Service 
research geologist in charge of the 10,000 assorted thermal attractions of 
Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
They are also in the front line in a lonely effort to preserve geysers around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Geysers are very, very rare," says Paul Strasser, a geyser gazer from 
Sacramento and secretary of the Geyser Observation and Study Assn. Geysers in 
Iceland, Siberia, Asia and Chile have been lost forever when geothermal plants 
were built nearby, upsetting the precise balance of heat, water and steam that 
make geysers operate. New Zealand, which once had more than 300 active geysers, 
is down to about a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
Most environmentalists see geothermal power as a clean alternative to fossil 
fuels or nuclear power, Strasser noted, and so are not exactly fired up about 
preserving the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Strasser was surprised when a field representative for the Nature Conservancy 
listened with interest to his plea to save a small geyser field near Reno. The 
conservancy hadn't known that there were geysers on the same land they were 
trying to preserve as habitat for a rare form of buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
No one has suggested that Yellowstone's geysers be disrupted by the steam wells 
of a geothermal plant. In fact, Yellowstone has been protected as a park and 
has been attracting visitors since before Lt. Col. George A. Custer stood his 
last stand. 
</P>
<P>
Moss first came to Yellowstone in 1963 to see the bears. By 1980, she was 
coming back for the geysers. Now, every Aug. 17, from her home in Albany, Ind., 
she sets out for the park in her Ford Econoline van, equipped with a bed, table 
and microwave; and 1,700 miles later, she is with her geysers again. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just a fabulous thing to see," she said last Tuesday, the last day of 
Yellowstone's summer season. "And I guess now you would say they have become a 
passion. I'm very serious about them." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Geyser had in recent years been her favorite "until I saw Daisy and 
Splendid in simultaneous eruptions in the winter of '86," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Giant has been her research project since 1987. It is an extremely noisy 
and powerful geyser during eruption, and a legendary feature in the park. Its 
eruptions have been few and far between for the last three decades, but it may 
be making a comeback. Last year, it went off four times. 
</P>
<P>
Moss has never seen Giant erupt. The last time she missed it, she was down the 
road, checking a geyser called Opal. "It has avoided letting me see it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And so, as the few straggling tourists leave, making their way up the icy 
highway toward Bozeman, Mont., and as West Yellowstone prepares for the return 
of the U.S. Olympic ski team for winter training, Moss hangs on for a couple 
more days, just in case.

<TEXT>
<P>
A generation after Medgar Evers and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were killed, the 
nation's first memorial to martyrs of the civil rights movement was unveiled 
Sunday as relatives expressed hope that young people will carry on the spirit 
of that turbulent era. 
</P>
<P>
Several people cried as they touched the cool water that flows across a 
circular black granite slab engraved with important events of the era, 
including the names of 40 people who died in the struggle for racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial is of the same material and by the same architect as the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will vitalize the struggle, keep it fresh in the minds . . . for 
the youth," said Ollie Gordon, a Chicago schoolteacher whose cousin, 
14-year-old Emmett Till, was shot to death in 1955 by whites angered that he 
had spoken to a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk about Martin Luther King and ask why we celebrate his birthday, and 
many children don't know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 law enforcement officers provided security for the dedication 
ceremony after relatives viewed the monument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very moving experience," said Myrlie Evers of Los Angeles, whose 
husband, Medgar, was the highest-ranking NAACP officer in Mississippi when he 
was assassinated in 1963. "It says to me that there's hope." 
</P>
<P>
Julian Bond, the first black state lawmaker in Georgia, said it was also 
important to remember others besides King and Evers who died in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a Martin Luther King 
movement," he said. "Many were ordinary, everyday people who rose above their 
ordinariness to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The $700,000 monument also honors James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael 
Schwerner, who were shot to death during the 1964 Freedom Summer and whose 
slayings inspired the movie "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
"Poetry in granite" was how Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman of New York, 
described the memorial designed by Maya Lin. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody who sees it can (but) feel that it's a moving, moving piece of art," 
Carolyn Goodman said. "It brings that period so vividly alive that you can 
almost relive it." 
</P>
<P>
The monument is in front of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a few blocks from 
the Alabama Capitol, where Jefferson Davis took the oath of office as president 
of the Confederacy in 1861, and near the Baptist church where King started the 
Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-foot-high granite wall is inscribed with words King chose for his first 
speech during the bus boycott: "Until justice rolls down like water and 
righteousness like a mighty stream." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther King III, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said he thought his 
father's words were "very appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
He said the memorial focuses attention on inequalities that still exist and 
will serve as a hands-on history lesson for young people. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they can get an understanding of why people lost their lives," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The law center published a 104-page magazine that tells the story of each 
person named on the monument, and copies were sent to schools around the 
country.

<P>
Israel has agreed to open peace talks with Palestinians as long as the United 
States guarantees that none of them belong to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, Israeli officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's policy-making Inner Cabinet made the demand on Washington on Sunday as 
it formally accepted a five-point plan drafted by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III designed to get talks under way. 
</P>
<P>
The Inner Cabinet approved Baker's plan on the "assumption" that the Bush 
Administration would limit participation to non-PLO residents of the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip and also restrict the subject of the talks to Israel's 
election plan for the territory. 
</P>
<P>
The guarantees against PLO participation and on the scope of the talks must be 
put in writing, according to Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide of Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"What was left unclear in the five points will have to be clarified in an 
accompanying document," Ben-Aharon said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens asserted that, based on recent conversations he 
has had with Baker, he expects him to give into Israel's demands. 
</P>
<P>
"In the contacts that I have had with Secretary Baker this past month, we 
discussed the detailed wording of the five points that have been modified, plus 
additional assurances that Secretary Baker, in principle, is ready to give," 
Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Arens cautioned against quick progress. "We are talking about very 
complicated matters, not at all simple," he said. "It has already taken us a 
month to arrive at this point, so I don't want to be too optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who is attending a conference of Pacific Rim nations in Australia, said 
during a break in the meeting that the Israeli action "is just the first of 
what will probably be a very long and complicated and difficult process." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would give Israel the written assurances it is seeking, Baker said, 
"Well, we'll have to look at the detail of that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Baker added that "we are very pleased that they accepted the general 
framework. . . . We're pleased with the results so far." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, who is in Canberra 
with Baker, told reporters that "we are waiting to hear from the Egyptians." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from the Cairo government, which has offered to 
host Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shamir is scheduled to visit the United States next week, and 
his government's indecision over the Baker plan was casting a shadow over the 
trip. In apparent reference to the problem, Shamir said approval of the Baker 
plan was needed to show that Israel was "doing everything not to hurt our 
relations with the United States and to achieve a peace we can live with." 
</P>
<P>
A nearly two-year-old uprising in the territories has prompted the search for a 
peace formula. 
</P>
<P>
In his five-point program, Baker had invited the Israeli representatives to 
meet with officials from the United States and Egypt in order to draw up a list 
of members for a Palestinian peace panel. The Palestinians and Israelis would 
then negotiate terms for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel had 
demanded a clear veto on the makeup of the Palestinian delegation, a request 
Baker was unwilling to meet -- although he made minor changes in wording to 
narrow the talks' scope. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government opposes talks with the PLO because the group wants to 
set up an independent state alongside Israel that, in Israel's view, would 
threaten the security of the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Besides barring the PLO and limiting the agenda, Israel is asking the United 
States to back Israeli actions should talks not work out. Israel also has asked 
that the Cairo talks not be open-ended; one meeting in Cairo would be followed 
by others only if Israel is satisfied with the initial results. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to formally adopt Baker's plan followed a weekend of heavy 
wrangling between top officials of the two main partners in Israel's ruling 
coalition, Shamir and Arens from the right-wing Likud Party and Finance 
Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin from the centrist 
Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
All six Labor members in the Inner Cabinet voted to accept Baker's plan and 
approve the conditions; three of the six Likud ministers, including Shamir, 
also voted yes. Three Likud members voted no. The trio -- hawkish ministers 
Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Modai and David Levy -- see the talks a preliminary to 
contact with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp disagreements within and between the parties -- Labor has threatened to 
pull out of the coalition several times -- had made it difficult to reach any 
decision on the Baker plan. 
</P>
<P>
Likud opposes giving up sovereignty over the territories, home to 1.7 million 
Palestinians, and is wary that Baker's plan might trap Israel into talks with 
the PLO. Labor is willing to take a chance that, should the PLO show up for 
talks, Israel could walk away. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Shamir assured his followers, "As long as we are in the 
government, there will be no Palestinian state and no contacts with the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Baker presented what American officials called "a non-paper" of 
five points to bring Israeli and Palestinian peace delegates together. That 
offer followed a 10-point list of "clarifications" put forward by Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, who invited Israeli officials to meet with the 
Palestinians in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Palestinians is meant, according to Israeli officials, to 
discuss "modalities" of elections designed to select yet another Palestinian 
negotiating team. The elected team would work out with Israel details of an 
"interim arrangement" for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. After three years, more 
talks would be held to reach a final solution for the land and its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the series of proposals have all faltered on the question of who 
will represent the Palestinians in talks. Under the Israeli election plan, 
announced by Shamir in May, only non-PLO Palestinians living in the occupied 
territories would participate. 
</P>
<P>
However, both the United States, which is Israel's staunchest ally, and Egypt, 
the only Arab country to recognize Israel, have been talking with the PLO about 
Shamir's plan. Baker has insisted that Washington does not intend to pressure 
Israel to deal with the PLO. Mubarak, on the other hand, has said PLO 
participation was a key to getting talks under way. 
</P>
<P>
It is this contradiction that the Inner Cabinet's demands are meant to clear 
up, Shamir aide Ben-Aharon said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLO was being doubly cagey. Its executive committee, headed by 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, met over the weekend in Cairo to discuss Baker's 
plan. The group reached a decision, news reports said, but left town without 
announcing what it was.

PACIFIC RIM NATIONS SEEKING UNITY; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: ECONOMIC COHESIVENESS IS THE GOAL AS 12 NATIONS MEET IN AUSTRALIA. BUT 
NO DRAMATIC GAINS ARE EXPECTED.

What Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called "the Pacific century" began 
cautiously Sunday when the leaders of 12 Pacific Rim nations opened an economic 
cooperation conference that is audacious in concept but modest in expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III led a U.S. delegation that also includes 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and trade negotiator Carla Anderson 
Hills. The conference is the first comprehensive attempt to meld the Pacific 
region's disparate and often feuding nations into a cohesive organization. 
</P>
<P>
The nations joining the United States here in the Australian capital include 
Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the six members of the 
Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"Closer, more effective regional cooperation is an idea whose time has come," 
Hawke said. "We are entering or have already entered the Pacific century." 
</P>
<P>
Hawke conceded that the notion has been coming for a long time. Proposals for 
Pacific Rim economic blocs have been made at least since the mid-1960s but have 
always foundered because, in the final analysis, the nations of the region have 
little in common except for their geography. 
</P>
<P>
The plan may fare better this time because the 12 nations are also motivated by 
a newly realized need to prevent the region's economic frictions from sapping 
its remarkable economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is applying pressure to Japan and South Korea to open their 
markets to more American goods. In Korea, at least, the effort has produced an 
upsurge of anti-Americanism. The other 10 countries are concerned about the 
domination of the superpowers in Tokyo and Washington. Malaysia is free-trade 
oriented, while Singapore is protectionist. The list of potential disputes is 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the conference hope problems that have defied solution in 
bilateral terms can be solved in the larger context. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian official said the process will give the other 10 countries 
greater leverage in their dealings with the United States and Japan. He said it 
could provide "a way of making our interests count." 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said the conference will give the United 
States and Japan a way to "communicate a sense of the positive possibilities 
for the other nations in the region without posing a threatening role." 
</P>
<P>
However, no one expects the new forum to produce dramatic results. The 
conference will reach decisions by consensus, meaning that any one of the 
participants can veto any proposed action. For this reason, organizers have 
decided not to try to craft a final communique, a process that often results in 
lengthy squabbles over wording. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Australian officials said that the only concrete decision they expect 
is an agreement to hold at least two more similar meetings. Indonesia has 
offered to host a meeting in 1990, and South Korea has offered to hold one in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
All 12 nations seem to agree that the meeting, officially called the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, will not evolve into a trading bloc 
like the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not meet here at this time with any hidden agenda to create some form of 
Pacific trading bloc," Hawke said. "Our commitment is to open, multilateral 
trade. Our united resolve is that the world economy should not fragment into 
defensive trading blocs." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, all 12 nations at the conference profess 
capitalistic economic systems. U.S. officials like to suggest that the meeting 
is also one of political democracies. This is certainly true in many cases, but 
Brunei is an absolute monarchy, and some of the other nations practice only 
limited democracy. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the group's "unifying principle is market economics." 
</P>
<P>
Left out of the meeting, at least for the time being, are two of Asia's fastest 
growing and dynamic economies, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The two, along with 
Singapore and South Korea, make up Asia's so-called Four Tigers -- the newly 
industrialized nations that are pushing their way into the first rank of the 
world's economic powers. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the conference concluded that Taiwan and Hong Kong could not be 
included as long as the People's Republic of China was left out. After 
Beijing's suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations last June, the inclusion 
of China this time was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the United States, Japan and Australia all say that eventual 
inclusion of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong should be discussed. The issue is made 
more complex because both Beijing and Taipei claim to be the capital of China, 
while Hong Kong, now a British colony, is scheduled to become part of China in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
Conference sources say that the six ASEAN nations are the most strongly opposed 
to including the rival Chinese entities.

Vice President Dan Quayle on Sunday pronounced himself "very pleased" with 
President Bush's stated intention to keep him on the Republican ticket in 1992 
but said it was too early to speak of his own presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things that can happen between now and '92, and 1993 and 1996 are a 
long, long time away," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance on the NBC-TV program "Meet the Press," the vice president 
said that Bush had not informed him personally of the decision, but he added: 
"I am very pleased that the President is pleased with the job that I am doing." 
</P>
<P>
Bush stated his intention during an interview with the Dallas Morning News, 
which published the account over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Others were also pleased with Bush's pronouncement. Democratic National 
Chairman Ron Brown said: "It certainly pleases me. The problem with this 
Administration: It's been an Administration of symbols over substance. Dan 
Quayle is a good symbol for the Democrats to take a hard look at . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, who appeared with Brown on ABC's "This Week With 
David Brinkley," said of Quayle: "I think he's done a good job. He's been loyal 
to the President. He's a good man . . . "

GAO URGES CLOSING COSTLY LOOPHOLE IN U.S. WATER LAW 
</P>

Congress should close a loophole in the law that regulates use of federally 
subsidized water supplies, the General Accounting Office said in a report 
released Sunday. The congressional watchdog agency said that the government is 
losing millions of dollars in revenue because some farmers are taking advantage 
of the law to qualify for cheap irrigation rates. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Reclamation Reform Act, designed to help states where water is scarce, 
primarily in the West, allows farms of 960 acres or less to receive water at 
low, subsidized rates. Some owners of large farms, particularly in California, 
have circumvented the size limit by reorganizing their holdings into smaller 
parcels so that they qualify for the cheap water. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressional expectations have not been met," the report said in recommending 
that the loophole be closed. 
</P>
<P>
In one case study cited in the report, Alpha Farms, one of California's leading 
cotton producers, reorganized its 12,345 acres into separate landholdings 
through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations and 11 trusts. The GAO said there were 
indications that the smaller holdings, all in the Central Valley, continued to 
be operated as one large farm. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, the GAO said, a father, son, daughter and her husband each 
owned parts of a 4,638-acre farm and applied for the subsidized water as four 
landholdings of less than 960 acres each. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the family continued to operate the four landholdings as one farm," 
the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
In the sample cases it reviewed, the GAO found that owners or lessees in 1987 
paid about $1.3 million less for federal water than they would have paid if 
their respective multiple landholdings had been considered collectively as 
large farms subject to the legal size limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Reduced revenues likely will continue to occur annually unless the act is 
amended," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Interior and Insular 
Affairs subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, blamed the 
Interior Department for allowing farmers to get around the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Wealthy farmers in California's Central Valley have subverted the intent of 
federal water laws and top Interior Department officials, aware of the abuse, 
declined to take corrective action," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Interior Department, said Sunday that 
Interior officials had not yet seen the report. "However, if Rep. Miller 
believes the law should be changed, that is certainly within his purview as a 
member of Congress," he said. "The secretary has a responsibility to carry out 
the law as it is written." 
</P>
<P>
The law does not "preclude multiple landholdings, each of which is within the 
act's 960-acre limit, to continue to be operated collectively as one large farm 
while individually qualifying for federally subsidized water," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some farmers have taken advantage of this loophole by reorganizing their farms 
into multiple, smaller landholdings to be eligible to receive additional 
federally subsidized water . . . using various partnerships, corporations, 
and/or trust arrangements," the report continued. "For all practical purposes, 
these smaller landholdings continue to be operated collectively as single large 
farms, much as they were before being reorganized." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO emphasized, however, that "these reorganized farms do not violate the 
act's language" and that audits "have found and will likely continue to find 
them to be in compliance with the act's 960-acre limit." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO said in its report that the Interior Department "agreed that some 
farmers have reorganized their farms into smaller holdings to maintain large 
farming operations while complying with the act's acreage limit . . . . 
However, Interior cautioned that it is not convinced that the Congress expected 
to apply the 960-acre limit to land being operated as one unit."

N.Y. MAYORAL RIVALS SPAR IN DEBATE AS VOTE NEARS

Democrat David N. Dinkins clashed in campaign debate with New York mayoral 
rival Rudolph W. Giuliani on Sunday while gubernatorial contenders sought 
support in Virginia and New Jersey in the final days of an off-year election 
season focusing on race and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls pointed to a possible Democratic sweep on Tuesday in the three 
most closely watched races -- L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia in his bid to 
become the nation's first elected black governor, Dinkins in his drive to 
become his city's first black mayor and Rep. James J. Florio to become governor 
of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The underdog Republicans in those three races have been thrown on the defensive 
by their pro-choice opponents on the issue of abortion. The subject has emerged 
as a potent issue in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling permitting 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The New York mayoral race featured harsh personal attacks lobbed by former U.S. 
Atty. Giuliani against Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president. The two locked 
horns Sunday in an angry second televised debate that featured Giuliani's 
continued focus on financial problems surrounding Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of our town don't want a prosecutor. They want a mayor," Dinkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want a mayor who doesn't have to fear a prosecutor," Giuliani shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani told reporters after the debate that Dinkins "needs to be 
investigated." 
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, Wilder, buoyed by a Richmond Times-Dispatch poll reporting a 
9-point edge, was campaigning Sunday in the state's coal mining region. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, was in the northwestern part of the state to 
conclude a weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to 
coal miners that he would "sabotage" the state's right-to-work law by 
permitting unions to collect dues from non-union workers covered by union 
contracts. Wilder says he supports the right-to-work law. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, Florio, with a poll showing him with a lead of 24 points, called 
for the election of Democratic candidates to the State Assembly, where 
Republicans have a two-seat majority. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Rep. Jim Courter dismissed the newspaper poll as he made his way 
around the state.

PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS SMALL BUT IMPORTANT LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sometimes the lessons learned from an earthquake are small -- but important. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Los Angeles International Airport used the San Francisco quake as 
a living laboratory. "We tried to take our earthquake plan and superimpose it 
on San Francisco," said Capt. Bernard Wilson of the airport police department. 
</P>
<P>
And what he found was, "the little things come to mind." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is now stockpiling batteries for radios and flashlights. "You'd be 
surprised at how many batteries you go through when the lights got out," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials who raced to San Francisco in the hours after the temblor 
also quickly learned that stranded passengers in terminals will need a host of 
products and services that had not been planned on, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among those products are disposable diapers, which are also now on 
Wilson's shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
Other jurisdictions got down to similar levels of fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
Besides death and destruction that a team of Los Angeles County building 
inspectors witnessed in San Francisco, they also found a shortage of simple 
government forms -- which are always somehow necessary but particularly so in 
an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Biddlecomb, assistant superintendent of building and safety for Los Angeles 
County, said "I want to make sure we have what we need . . . the lesson here 
is, 'be prepared.' " As a result, the presses at the county are now humming to 
produce reams of building inspection forms. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors also responded swiftly to the Northern California quake. 
Supervisors voted unanimously two weeks ago to seek private funding for a 
second "Yogi Bear Schoolhouse," a mobile classroom that simulates an 
8.7-magnitude earthquake and is used to acquaint children with earthquake 
safety information. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest lesson for some disaster planners is that planning isn't 
needed for some things. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, for instance, has elaborate plans for evacuating terminals after 
an earthquake. But Wilson found in San Francisco that "once the ground starts 
to shake, the ceiling tiles start to fall and power goes out . . . people 
self-evacuate."

ANOTHER JOLT JARS ODDITY IN SIMI VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: THE BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE ONLY ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS OF THIS FOLK ART

<P>
Bottle Village has been called many things in its quirky 30-year history in 
Simi Valley. An eyesore. Folk art. A historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as cities statewide survey buildings for potential earthquake hazards, 
Bottle Village has been named one of only two unreinforced masonry structures 
in the Ventura County city. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has to tell the Preserve Bottle Village Committee that the odd 
collection of bottle-and-mortar huts -- or their organization -- lies on shaky 
ground. The new, earthquake-related label is just the latest of the foundering 
group's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"What other community has something like Bottle Village?" asked supporter 
Joanne Johnson. "It's got to be the most unusual thing in Ventura County, and 
yet it's falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years after it was formed to save the village from demolition, the 
committee has dwindled to three artists, is about $5,000 in debt and has lost 
its tax-exempt status. An engineering study of the village's 13 unconventional 
buildings is incomplete and the group has become mired in the city's 
bureaucracy as it tries to renew an expired operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the village remains closed to the public, except for occasional 
tours by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Its new designation as an "unreinforced masonry structure" stems from a 
state-required survey in which building inspectors are expected to identify 
structures of brick or stone that are not reinforced to modern, 
earthquake-conscious standards. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, a 20-year-old city of gleaming shopping centers and 
cookie-cutter houses, the only other structure on the list is a nearly 
200-year-old adobe in Strathearn Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what the label means for Bottle Village, and the adobe, is unclear. 
Inventories of cities' unreinforced buildings and plans for strengthening them 
are due Jan. 1. Gaddis Farmer, Simi Valley's chief building official, said he 
is still preparing his report, which will have to take into consideration the 
village's protected status as a California State Historical Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The village committee's own engineering study, commissioned four years ago to 
determine how best to restore and preserve the buildings, is also supposed to 
address earthquake issues. But that report is on hold because the committee 
owes its engineer money, said Brian Gabler, an assistant to Simi Valley's city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six years, the committee has exhausted an estimated $50,000 in 
grants and donations for a variety of expenses and, as Johnson put it last 
week, "We have nothing to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our financial records are so murky I really don't know what was going on," she 
said. "Here we are these three honest people, trying to put back together this 
house of cards...." 
</P>
<P>
The village immortalizes ordinary objects, otherwise condemned as trash: dolls, 
scissors, nails, bits of glass and tile. A metal sign embedded in the ground at 
the village's entrance bears the cryptic slogan: "They Last." 
</P>
<P>
A visitor once remarked to Johnson that virtually every object had been held in 
human hands. Tinted bottles floating in cement, filtering Southern California 
sunlight like stained glass, give the 1-acre complex of tiny buildings and 
mosaic walkways its name. 
</P>
<P>
Creator Tressa (Grandma) Prisbrey started Bottle Village in the 1950s to house 
her collection of 17,000 pencils. For more than 20 years, she added on using 
refuse from a local dump. The buildings have odd, fairy-tale names -- Parade of 
Dolls, Home of Little Mothers, Bottle House, the Rumpus Room, Cleopatra's 
Bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she died last year in a San Francisco nursing home at 92, Prisbrey 
was an internationally recognized folk artist and her life's work was a state 
historic landmark. But in Simi Valley, Bottle Village might have been razed for 
condos if not for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
And although the committee received a $25,000 grant from the city, the village 
today is hardly a celebrated cause among local arbiters of history and lore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the general consensus throughout the population that it's something 
that should be conserved. There are those who question what it's artistic merit 
is," said Dmitri Hunt, planning and development administrator for the Rancho 
Simi Recreation and Parks District, whose property includes the Strathearn 
adobe. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I personally like it?" said Patricia Havens, the city's designated 
historian and director of the Strathearn park museum. "I try to stay neutral on 
that . . . I'm more inclined to be interested in the ordinary family, the 
ordinary individuals who made this community what it is, rather than one or two 
in the limelight for eccentric things." 
</P>
<P>
"At one time it was Simi Valley's claim to fame, the only reason we were in the 
Auto Club book," Mayor Gregory Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee President Helen Dennert and Johnson both readily concede the 
organization's past administrative failings. Past president David Kaplan, 
credited with raising much of the committee's spent funds, could not be reached 
for comment. Neither Dennert nor Johnson expected to be committee officers when 
they originally volunteered, they said, and now find themselves leaders by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
The group's top priority is regaining its tax-exempt status so it can raise 
funds again. Because of an apparent oversight, Johnson and Dennert said, the 
group never applied for permanent tax-exempt status and its temporary 
designation expired five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dennert and Johnson also want to join the committee with a more conventional 
group such as the park district, because "if Bottle Village had been attached 
to an institution, people would have been touring it," Dennert said. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the committee's more immediate problems, Johnson can't help but 
smile ruefully at the prospect of earthquake-proofing Bottle Village. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the choice of where to die during an earthquake, I would rather succumb 
and be buried in the rubble of Bottle Village than be wasted in the debris of a 
poorly designed freeway," she wrote recently while organizing the committee's 
paper work.

4 MEN DIE, WOMAN WOUNDED IN WEEKEND STREET VIOLENCE

The Sunday morning discovery of a man's body in a gutter has shocked many 
residents on Belle Porte Avenue in Harbor City at a time when some say they 
have been feeling a new sense of security in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Police had no suspects or motive in the death of a 27-year-old man who, 
coroner's officials said, died of "blunt trauma to the head." The victim's name 
was not released because his relatives have not been notified, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, a handful of residents stood on the sidewalk at Belle 
Porte and 251st Street, talking of the slaying and staring at the droplets of 
blood in the gutter and a single black thong, a rubber sandal that they believe 
had been worn by the dead man. 
</P>
<P>
"How can someone kill another like that?" asked Olivia Lugo, 19, whose 
apartment faces the scene. "The body was right next to my dad's car. It's 
frightening for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Area residents have long complained about day laborers, sometimes as many as 
150, who sought work near the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Belle Porte, 
loitering on their front lawns and porches, sometimes harassing passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
But a week ago nearly all of the men left the area when Los Angeles city 
officials opened a hiring hall -- the first of its kind in the city -- at a 
nearby park, 
</P>
<P>
"Just when we are starting to feel a little better, now we have this," said 
Debbie Shipman, 31. "It's getting harder and harder to make our house quiet and 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had little information on the 2:30 a.m. killing and would not 
say if the man was a neighborhood resident, had a gang affiliation, or had been 
known to seek day labor in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Miguel Sanchez, 19, of Cerritos was beaten to death by five 
baseball bat-wielding youths, one of whom was arrested Sunday afternoon, a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:20 a.m., Sanchez stopped his car at Vickie Avenue and Artesia Boulevard in 
Cerritos and was confronted by the youths who shouted gang slogans and 
challenged him to a fight. When Sanchez left his car, he was severely beaten on 
the head, said Deputy Bill Wehner. He died Sunday afternoon at Pioneer Hospital 
in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested one suspect, Joffrey Deleon Lagadia, 18, at his home in Yorba 
Linda, in Orange County, late Sunday afternoon on suspicion of murder. He was 
being held without bail at the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were seeking more suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police were investigating two gang-related drive-by 
shootings that left two men dead in the city's Vermont and Lincoln Heights 
districts. In both cases gang slogans were exchanged and then gunshots rang out 
from passing cars, killing bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hutchins, 27, died in front of a house in the 1200 block of 102nd Street 
shortly after midnight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln Heights, a San Gabriel man was killed and a woman companion was 
wounded in a shooting at 11:40 p.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Lopez, 24, was standing in a parking lot on the 2900 block of North 
Broadway when he was shot. The woman, who was not identified, was in stable 
condition at Huntington Memorial Hospital, police said.

One of six pregnant U.S. women fails to receive proper prenatal care, and wide 
differences exist in the quality of care offered to expectant mothers across 
the nation, according to a report released last week. A study by the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute found that about 16% of all women who give birth do not 
begin prenatal care until their fifth month or make fewer than half the number 
of visits recommended by medical experts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report found that as of the mid-1980s, only 1% of U.S. 
counties met the federal goal of at least 90% of mothers starting prenatal care 
in their first three months. The report by the New York-based nonprofit group 
found that inadequate care is highest among teen-age, unmarried and minority 
women -- groups who generally are at higher risk for low birth-weight and 
premature babies. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of teen-age mothers and one-third of unmarried mothers received 
inadequate care, about double the rate for all women, the researchers found. In 
addition, 32% of Indians, 30% of Latinos and 27% of blacks got poor prenatal 
care, compared with 13% of whites and Asians.

There appears to be little basis for the theory that smoking by teen-age girls 
reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life, scientists said last week. 
</P>
<P>
A Harvard University study of women ages 30 to 55 found no statistical link 
between smoking and the risk of breast cancer. The study was published in the 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have suggested that heavy smoking by young women might lower 
the risk of breast cancer by reducing the body's production of estrogen while 
the breasts are developing. Estrogen controls female sexual development, but 
some studies have suggested that it also may promote the development of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The study looked at female nurses who were cancer-free in 1976. The nurses' 
smoking habits were closely tracked for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, many cases of breast cancer had been documented in the group but there 
was no association between current smoking and risk of cancer.

Researchers increased a hundredfold the amount of electricity that could be 
carried by crystals of superconducting material, boosting hopes for making the 
materials practical, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
The work indicates a solution is possible for one obstacle to making 
high-temperature superconductors carry useful amounts of current, said 
researcher Robert B. van Dover of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, 
N.J., where the research was done in conjunction with Swedish scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without resistance. All 
those discovered so far must be chilled to work. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, scientists have created high-temperature superconductors, so 
named because they require less chilling than previously known materials. They 
want to use these new materials in such applications as high-power magnets, 
high-speed trains and devices for storing electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers bombarded a crystal of superconducting material with neutrons, 
tiny particles that make up parts of atoms. The crystal could then carry about 
100 times the current that untreated crystals could without losing 
superconductivity, they found.

GLOBAL CAMPAIGN AIMS TO MAKE PARASITIC GUINEA WORM SECOND ILLNESS ERADICATED

ABEOKUTA, Nigeria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stooped and wizened, Dawda Agdegbe easily looked twice his 40 years as he 
explained why he had not worked his yam field for 14 months, leaving it to 
become fallow and overgrown with weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"When the disease starts, you can't work," he said, exhibiting his scarred and 
blistered legs. "It causes pain throughout the body and you can't walk." 
</P>
<P>
Next to him on a splintered bench at the rear of a dark schoolhouse, a 
half-dozen of his neighbors sat quietly -- farmers, women, children. All showed 
some stage of the disease that Agdegbe described: guinea worm. 
</P>
<P>
From the legs of some, the threadlike white parasite was already emerging, in 
the final painful and debilitating stage of the malady. Others showed high 
round blisters or the scars of a dozen earlier infections. 
</P>
<P>
Today this disease, known by its scientific term dracunculiasis, affects 10 
million people a year in parts of India, Pakistan, and a belt of 16 African 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
It is rarely fatal, but its toll should not be underestimated. Its outbreaks 
tend to peak during harvest season, so acres of crops lie rotting in the fields 
because farmers are crippled for half the year. In Nigeria, one of the 
worst-affected lands, an estimated $20 million a year is lost this way in 
rice-growing districts alone, in areas with a population of only 1.6 million. 
The total cost across the agricultural spectrum is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
During the annual outbreaks, Nigerian district officials can count a 100% drop 
in school attendance among children from villages with endemic dracunculiasis. 
In some places, people are infected repeatedly over their lifetimes, year after 
year, from infancy to old age. In such cases the toxins excreted by the 
parasite eventually produce a permanent arthritis-like disability. 
</P>
<P>
Yet guinea worm may be closer to extermination than any other of the world's 
parasites. A group of Western donors supervised by the United Nations and 
Global 2000, a private development agency organized by former President Jimmy 
Carter, has begun a campaign to make dracunculiasis the second disease, after 
smallpox, to be completely eradicated from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent conference in the Nigerian capital of Lagos, the donor agencies 
pledged $9.4 million for next year, the first step toward the goal of 
extermination by the year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"This clearly is an end-of-the-road disease," said Dr. William H. Foege, a 
former official of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control. He 
participated in the smallpox eradication campaign in Africa and is assisting 
with the guinea worm program. 
</P>
<P>
The guinea worm program represents an attempt, uncommon in the developing 
world, to aim at a health goal that is attainable. The extermination of many 
diseases more lethal would require reserves of political will, stability, money 
and manpower that are simply beyond the capacity of the Third World, even with 
millions of dollars in assistance from developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to get rid of cholera and typhus, but we can't," said Peter 
Bourne, a former Carter Administration aide who now heads a Washington 
nonprofit development group called Global Water. 
</P>
<P>
Some anti-disease campaigns can also aggravate conditions if they do not 
proceed uninterruptedly to a decisive conclusion, something often very 
difficult amid the Third World's political and economic instability. 
</P>
<P>
A half-finished malaria eradication campaign mounted by the French in the 1970s 
in Madagascar, for instance, is now being blamed for a resurgence in fatal 
cases of that disease in the island's central highlands. World Health 
Organization inspectors believe the campaign initially was so effective that 
local residents lost their natural immunity to the malaria parasite, which they 
normally acquire from repeated low-level infection. As malaria has crept back 
into the region over the past two or three years, it has caused at least 50,000 
deaths, and possibly as many as 100,000, among the overly vulnerable 
population. 
</P>
<P>
A similar program to eliminate bovine sleeping sickness in Zimbabwe cost the 
lives of an estimated 1 million head of unprotected cattle when the program was 
halted during the Zimbabwean civil war of the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Guinea worm disease carries no such risk, scientists say. Infection by the 
parasite, no matter how frequent, does not create immunity, so people freed of 
the disease are not more menaced if it returns. There is no known technical 
obstacle to its eradication; chemical treatments to clear the parasite from 
water sources are available, and cheaper mechanical means of cleaning drinking 
water are common. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to break the life cycle of this parasite," Bourne said. 
</P>
<P>
The life cycle harbors no particular mysteries. Guinea worm can be communicated 
to humans only one way: drinking infected water. The worm's larvae enter the 
body through the alimentary canal and grow into threadlike white worms of as 
much as eight to 10 inches in length. Over a period of six months to a year 
they make a painful migration within the body toward the skin of the legs, 
where they eventually become visible as large blisters or show their serpentine 
form under the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, like the creature in the movie "Alien," they burst through the skin. 
At that point, victims can begin to extract them by winding them around a stick 
or pencil, tugging them out painfully, a fraction of an inch a day. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cure once a person is infected; only the parasite's inexorable 
creep toward the skin can rid the body of the affliction. Once the life cycle 
of the parasite is complete and the worm leaves the body -- a matter of perhaps 
several months -- the person is rid of the infection. But reinfection is a 
major problem. 
</P>
<P>
Victims driven to seek relief from the burning and itching of their blisters 
stand in the ponds or streams that provide their villages with drinking water; 
that causes the blisters to burst, sending worm eggs into the water and 
beginning the cycle of pollution and infection all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the obvious remedy: Keep infected people out of the ponds, provide capped 
and pumped wells for drinking water, teach rural villagers to strain or boil 
water before using it. 
</P>
<P>
This is a disease for which low-tech solutions are ideal. Unlike rabies, which 
kills 52,000 people a year and whose wild-animal carriers are impossible to 
vaccinate, guinea worm has no animal host except man. Unlike measles, which 
kills 2 million uninoculated children a year, guinea worm requires no vaccine. 
Unlike syphilis or AIDS, fighting it demands no radical change in social 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
"In theory, this should be so much easier to eliminate than smallpox," Foege 
said. "With smallpox, we had to identify every last case and treat it. There 
was no alternative to dealing with individuals. With guinea worm, we just have 
to treat the water supply in each affected village." 
</P>
<P>
One program of education and well-drilling in a single village in the West 
African nation of Togo, according to Global 2000, reduced the incidence of 
dracunculiasis from 928 cases in 1981 to zero last year. 
</P>
<P>
Something else that gives the disease-hunters hope is the historical record on 
guinea worm. Dracunculiasis was once known all over the world. It was so 
familiar in ancient Greece that it may have inspired the caduceus, the familiar 
symbol of medical science in the form of two serpents entwining a winged staff. 
Some believe the serpents represent guinea worms, and the staff the stick 
around which a worm is wound so its victim can tug it out of his or her skin. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeks and Turks wiped out the disease centuries ago, and its range has 
been steadily shrinking. Dracunculiasis was exterminated from Russia in the 
1920s and from Iran in the 1960s. India's campaign has reduced the number of 
known cases to just over 10,000 last year from a peak of 45,000 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves only a belt of 16 countries across West and Central Africa where 
measureable progress is absent. Here the disease thrives on ignorance and 
neediness. Villagers use and reuse infected water sources mostly because they 
have not learned how easily guinea worm can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just banking on luck," said the farmer Agdegbe, noting that his 
villagers apply a natural remedy of black soap and onions to soothe the fiery 
discomfort of the disease, but do not habitually take any precautions with 
their water. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the disease's persistence is its confinement to the 
poorest and most rural districts of the African countries, which are unknown 
territory to the educated classes of government and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-President Carter, meeting with a group of Nigerian journalists during the 
Global 2000 conference, asked how many of them had even heard of guinea worm 
three years ago. Not a hand was raised. 
</P>
<P>
"Guinea worm is not a problem which the elite usually see," said Dr. Olikoye 
Ransome-Kuti, the Nigerian minister of health. "When Nigerians discovered there 
were 1 million cases in their country, they were surprised. They didn't even 
know it existed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUINEA WORM: HOW AND WHERE THIS CRIPPLING DISEASE STRIKES 
</P>
<P>
Guinea worm, known by its scientific term dracunculiasis, affects 10 million 
people a year in parts of India, Pakistan and a belt of 16 African countries. 
</P>
<P>
Guinea worm is communicated to humans through drinking water infected with the 
microscopic crustacean Cyclops, which carry the worm's larvae. The larvae enter 
the body through the alimentary canal, and grow into threadlike white worms of 
as much as eight to 10 inches in length. Over a period of six months to a year 
they make a painful migration within the body toward the skin of the legs, 
where they eventually become visible as large blisters. 
</P>
<P>
The worms burst through the skin and the victims can extract them by winding 
them around a stick or pencil, tugging them out painfully, a fraction of an 
inch a day. 
</P>
<P>
Dracunculiasis was once known all over the world. It was so familiar in ancient 
Greece that it may have inspired the caduceus, the familiar symbol of medical 
science in the form of two serpents entwining a winged staff. Some believe the 
serpents represent guinea worms, and the staff the stick around which a worm is 
wound.

VIKING COACH LASHES OUT AT CRITICS OF HIS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR

Coach Jerry Burns unleashed an apparently unprovoked, obscenity-riddled tirade 
against Viking fans and reporters who have heavily criticized his offensive 
coordinator, Bob Schnelker, after Minnesota's 23-21 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, local columnists began suggesting that Schnelker be 
replaced after Herschel Walker had only 12 carries in the Vikings' 24-14 loss 
to the New York Giants Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday afternoon, when the Metrodome's big-screen scoreboard showed 
Schnelker on the sidelines, the crowd lashed out with boos. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Burns lashed back. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I've got this . . . job, Bob Schnelker will be the . . . offensive 
coordinator," Burns screamed after stepping to the podium in an interview room. 
"We can't be responsible for the . . . blocking, or the . . . tackling or the . 
. . guys jumping offsides. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one dumb . . . play by (Alfred) Anderson when his . . . shoe is coming 
off. We're . . . hollering to call time out, but we run the . . . trap play and 
his . . . shoe comes off. That ain't Bob Schnelker's fault." 
</P>
<P>
Burns went on to list another three or four mistakes by his players before 
concluding that the criticism of Schnelker should cease. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally stopped yelling, someone asked him if his team had indeed just 
won a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we did, yeah," Burns said, softly. JOHN WEYLER

Curt Lindstrom, former Swedish national hockey coach, said he isn't surprised 
by Soviet star Igor Larionov's allegations that Soviet players used drugs at 
the 1986 World Championships in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets should receive a retroactive disqualification if it could be 
proved. But, of course, it will very hard to prove it now," said Lindstrom, 
whose Swedish team lost the gold medal game, 3-2, to the Soviets more than 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Larionov, now playing with the NHL Vancouver Canucks, claimed in a new book 
that the Soviet players and laboratory workers conspired to deceive drug 
testers at the 1986 Championships by hiding urine specimens behind toilets.

BENTLEY'S 68 LEADS WAY AS PROS WIN HINE CUP 
</P>

<P>
Scott Bentley, a pro at the Singing Hills Country Club, had played in the past 
two Century Club Matches, in which San Diego County's top amateur golfers meet 
its top professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Both times, Bentley had been on the losing end. The amateurs, in fact, were on 
a little bit of a roll. Entering this year's competition for the Hine Cup, they 
led the series, 9-8, and had won three of the past four. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win bad this year," Bentley said. "We really needed to win." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't look to good for the pros when the amateurs led, 25 1/2-19 1/2, after 
the first round Saturday. But the pros rallied strongly and outscored the 
amateurs, 50-24, in the match-play Nassau format Sunday to win the Hine Cup, 85 
1/2-49 1/2, at the Carlton Oaks Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had their chances on a newly revamped course. Carlton Oaks reopened 
Oct. 1 after 11 months of construction, and the new Dye Design course is 
quickly establishing itself as one of the most difficult in the county. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident Sunday as only three of the 20 amateurs and professionals were 
able to shoot better than a 78. Eight golfers shot 80 or above. 
</P>
<P>
The course has not received its rating since being revamped, but several of the 
pros thought it could be in the 75-76 range. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Michals of San Luis Rey Downs led the amateurs with a one-over-par 73, 
but Bentley had the day's best round, shooting a four-under 68 with six birdies 
and two bogeys. Chris Starkjohann of Pala Mesa Resort added a three-under 69 
for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone was going to be successful on the course, it figured to be Bentley, 
who is having his finest year as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Southern California Championships in July at Huntington Beach and 
subsequently received exemptions for the Shearson Lehman Hutton San Diego Open, 
the Los Angeles Open and the Bob Hope Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been my best year," said Bentley, 31. "I guess I'm maturing, getting a 
little smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley played at Monte Vista and Valhalla high schools and another year at 
Grossmont Community College. He then played for three years at San Diego State, 
from 1979-81. Bentley said his best finish at SDSU was third place in the Aztec 
Invitational his senior year.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: UCSD WINS REGIONAL TITLE, WILL PLAY HOST TO NCAA 
FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC San Diego women's soccer team won the NCAA Division III Western Regional 
championship Sunday in St. Paul, Minn., and will play host to the national 
championships for the first time Saturday and Sunday at UCSD's North Campus 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons were tied with St. Thomas, 1-1, after Felicia Faro's second-half 
goal forced overtime. After a scoreless 30-minute period, goalkeeper Julie 
Friess saved three penalty kicks, and UCSD advanced to the round of four for 
the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's semifinals, UCSD (17-1-1) will play New England Regional champion 
Plymouth State of New Hampshire (3-2), and Northeast Regional champion Ithaca 
College of New York (15-0-5) will play South/Mideast Regional champion 
Methodist of North Carolina (15-5). Game times have not been set. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the second half, Brian Craft-Negrete gave San Diego State a 1-0 
nonconference victory on a diving header against visiting UC Santa Barbara. Ken 
Taylor got the assist. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are 14-4-3 and will find out later today if they'll receive an NCAA 
playoff bid. Santa Barbara is 8-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Alberts of visiting UCSD scored two minutes into the overtime to lift the 
Tritons to a 2-1 victory over Claremont College in the opening round of the 
NCAA Division III Far West-Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont (17-2-1) opened scoring early in the first half, then Alberts scored 
before halftime to tie it, 1-1. UCSD (13-5-3) will meet St. John's of 
Collegeville, Minn., winner over Colorado College, for the West-Midwest 
Regional title this weekend. The site will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Tritons (20-12) open Division III Western Regional play Friday 
in La Verne. UCSD will play the winner of Thursday's Menlo College/Cal State

BABA COOL KEEPS HER COOL TO WIN ROWAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Considering how well-matched the $111,500 Louis R. Rowan Handicap field looked 
on paper, the tight finish Sunday was hardly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Running on the inside, Baba Cool beat Davie's Lamb by a head with Stylish Star 
another head back in third. Less than two lengths back were fourth- and 
fifth-place finishers Double Wedge and Sugarplum Gal. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining her fifth victory in 24 starts, Baba Cool -- the 2-1 favorite -- 
covered the one mile grass course in 1:33 2/5, and ended a drought for trainer 
Michael Whittingham, the son of Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
The Rowan was Michael's first stakes success at Santa Anita since Skywalker won 
the 1986 Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"When she didn't break well, I thought, 'We're in trouble,' " Whittingham said. 
"I was worried, but Laffit (Pincay) found a hole." 
</P>
<P>
A 4-year-old daughter of Kings Lake, Baba Cool spent most of the summer at 
Arlington Park in suburban Chicago. She had a first and a second in five 
out-of-town starts before returning to California. 
</P>
<P>
"She equalled a track record in her first race at Arlington, then she was 
second to Gaily Gaily," Whittingham said. "That was a mile and three-sixteenths 
and that's pushing her and it was a yielding course. She's really getting 
better. She's like a pet, real sweet. She was overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Baba Cool started slowly, and was in eighth place until she found room at the 
top of the stretch. There, she took the lead with about a sixteenth to go and 
held off Davie's Lamb, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star, who also started poorly, was in the photo finish despite having 
entered the stretch extremely wide. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Baba Cool would) be closer to the pace, but her hind legs slid out 
from under her leaving the gate," Pincay said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was a nice finish to a big weekend for Pincay, who won with Bayakoa 
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky getting through on the rail turning into the stretch," Pincay said 
of Sunday's victory. "When Eddie's mare came at the end, she responded well." 
</P>
<P>
After losing his first 12 starts, Oh Dat Fox has suddenly found success. 
</P>
<P>
He gained his third victory in his last four outings Sunday in an allowance 
race. It has been quite a turnaround for a gelding who once seemed content to 
finish second or third. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no difference in him," said trainer Lewis Cenicola of the 4-year-old 
son of Tally Ho The Fox. "Some people said he lost his best friend when he 
broke his maiden, but he's a trier. 
</P>
<P>
"He is working a lot better in the morning, so maybe he likes this track. But 
he's run well over every track. He did hang a few times, but maybe those other 
horses weren't quitting and he did carry a lot of weight in many of those 
races." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Oh Dat Fox's consistency cannot be faulted. He has been off the board 
only three times in 16 starts. 
</P>
<P>
So, where will the horse surface next? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what comes up," Cenicola said. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree Notes

Alex Solis and Jesus Castanon were both absent Sunday afternoon. The former 
missed a flight from Florida after riding Olympic Prospect and Pleasant Variety 
in the Breeders' Cup. Castanon, 16, was sore after a morning workout spill and 
was excused. . . . Brown Bess, from Northern California, worked a mile in 1:37 
4/5 Sunday morning and will be shipped here Tuesday for the $400,000 Yellow 
Ribbon on Sunday. Among her scheduled opponents in the 10-furlong Grade I are 
the much-improved Nikishka, Claire Marine, No Review and defending champion 
Delighter. European fillies Colorado Dancer and Be Exclusive are expected to be 
flown to California Tuesday and clear quarantine Thursday. . . . Gary 
Boulanger, who recently arrived from Bay Meadows, got his first victory locally 
aboard first-time starter Mahaska in the second race. . . . Fernando Valenzuela 
escaped injury when his mount, Rule The Ocean, fell during the sixth race. . . 
. Even though favorites did not win Sunday, there were two perfect tickets in 
the Pick Six, each worth $157,024.20.

STREET SMART: NEWPORT OFFICIALS DEFEND HIGHWAY DOUBLE WHAMMY

<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
This is regarding what I perceive to be an inefficiency in the public works 
department of either the state of California or Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The entire strip along the Pacific Coast Highway between MacArthur Boulevard 
and Jamboree Road in Newport Beach was completely redone last year -- a median 
strip was put in, extra lanes were added, curbs and gutters were installed. 
</P>
<P>
Now this year they're tearing up the entire link between MacArthur and Jamboree 
on the southbound lanes of this new street. That seems to me a complete waste 
of money. Someone in planning should have known if other work was needed and it 
should have been done at the time, or the improvements they made last year 
should have been delayed until this work was done. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Parker 
</P>

Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
Watching a busy section of Pacific Coast Highway get hit by jackhammers twice 
within a couple of years is indeed frustrating. But officials with the city of 
Newport Beach, which is coordinating the work, say there's a ready explanation 
for the double whammy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new six-lane setup between MacArthur Boulevard and Jamboree Road, the 
southbound lanes run atop the old four-lane highway, while the northbound lanes 
are new strips of asphalt, according to John Wolter, cooperative projects 
engineer for the city. Some parts of the old pavement, being used for the 
southbound lanes, need to be dug up and replaced, while the whole stretch has 
to be ground down and resurfaced with fresh asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Wolter said, there was not enough money to perform that 
rehabilitation work during the yearlong widening project, which was completed 
in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Officials went ahead with the widening instead of waiting until more money was 
available because they were anxious to get the job started, he said. Moreover, 
rehabilitation of the southbound lanes could not have coincided with the 
widening work because of a need for detour lanes, meaning the project simply 
would have been extended for several more months, Wolter said. 
</P>
<P>
They opted to combine the rehabilitation with the work currently under way to 
widen the highway between Jamboree and Bayside Drive, he said. The entire 
project is expected to be completed in April. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
This isn't really a question about commuting but the effect of commuting on the 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In Measure M (the Nov. 7 ballot measure that proposes a half-cent sales tax 
hike to raise money for numerous transportation improvements) they talk about 
widening the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5) from the current six lanes to 12 
lanes. In Santa Ana where Interstate 5 crosses Main Street, that looks to be 
impossible without the destruction of half of the city located next to the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to know how the engineers plan to do that, through double-decking, 
widening or what? 
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Luko Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the state Department of Transportation did a cost estimate for double 
decking the Santa Ana Freeway between the Garden Grove and Riverside freeways. 
It found $150 million would be saved in right-of-way purchases, but the 
project's price would jump by $340 million because of the added construction 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a reassessment of such double-decker designs was sparked by the 
collapse of a section of Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. As a result, don't expect 
to see a second deck along Interstate 5, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what you'll get is a wider freeway -- a much wider freeway. From the 
El Toro Y in the south to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Angeles County, 
the Santa Ana Freeway will be expanded from six lanes to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Near Main Street in Santa Ana, room will be made for the wider freeway mostly 
by spreading the pavement onto land now occupied by railroad tracks that are no 
longer in use, according to Barry Rabbitt, a Caltrans deputy director 
shepherding the project. But several homes in the area will be uprooted by the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway expansion is under way on a section between the El Toro Y and the 
Costa Mesa Freeway. But work is not expected to begin in Santa Ana until at 
least 1991 and the entire project will not be completed until after the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: How amazing! This morning as I got onto the Costa Mesa 
Freeway going south from the McFadden Avenue on-ramp, I was amazed at the 
progress made since last week. The barriers were down, the lane lines in, the 
ease of getting on certainly less traumatic and the traffic flowed smoothly. As 
work has progressed, I have noted increased traffic flow and fewer tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 this morning I was ready to write a letter commending Caltrans for a 
job well done -- I still feel that way -- but what a surprise to read your 
column today and hear the heated and vehement agreement about how awful the 
Costa Mesa Freeway is. 
</P>
<P>
I think Caltrans has had a monumental job and is succeeding very nicely. It's 
great to see and feel the progress. 
</P>

<P>
Much like beauty, a good freeway seems to be in the eye of the beholder. During 
our recent reader poll to select the most loathsome freeway in Orange County, 
the Costa Mesa Freeway was the outright winner. Or loser. However you want to 
look at it. Joyce Eriksen's letter was in a distinct minority. Far more were 
like the following missive. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: I agree the Costa Mesa Freeway is our worst freeway. One of 
the main reasons is the car-pool lane. Every car entering the car-pool lane 
must cross all other lanes of traffic before entering and after leaving the 
lane. Let's throw open the lane to utilize what is already built. 
</P>
<P>
Put me down as a reader who feels the real solution is in improving the 
existing highways and opening up the car-pool lanes to general-use traffic. It 
will probably also require a complete reorganization of the Orange County 
Transit District, which has contributed greatly to the mess we are in today. 
</P>

The much-maligned car-pool lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway are often targeted 
by commuters for ridicule. But there are those who feel car-pool lanes and 
mass-transit need to be emphasized in Orange County. Consider the next letter. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: I loathe all the freeways in Orange County equally. My 
feeling is that half the lanes on all of them should be dedicated to 
high-occupancy vehicles. I don't believe we should be adding new lanes for 
single-passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
There are some new freeways which are supposedly going to be busways. That 
remains to be seen. But I really think that half of all freeways should be 
dedicated to high-occupancy vehicles and we should not be encouraging 
single-passenger driving. 
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
Love them or hate them, car-pool lanes seem destined to be a fixture on Orange 
County freeways. Current plans call for adding car-pool lanes to almost every 
freeway in the county that doesn't already have them. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that Caltrans will fall far short of your goals. These days, the 
agency permits a new car-pool lane only if it augments -- but doesn't replace 
-- an existing mixed-use lane. The only freeway being eyed for multiple 
car-pool lanes is the Riverside Freeway, where plans call for a pair of the 
reserved lanes heading in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
As for busways, there is one planned as part of the Santa Ana Freeway 
expansion. This transit way, which will be open to both car pools and buses, is 
being designed to run down the center of the freeway from the Costa Mesa 
Freeway in the south to Katella Avenue in the north. It will be set off by 
barriers from the other lanes and feature its own on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
A clarification: Due to inaccurate information, we printed an error in last 
week's column. A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman told us that 
motorcyclists risk getting a ticket if they dash between rows of cars on the 
freeway during rush-hour 10 m.p.h. faster than the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A reader called to tell us he knew of no such 10 m.p.h. limit in the California 
Vehicle Code for "lane-splitting." He was right. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Phulps of the CHP's Santa Ana office said the safe speed for lane 
splitting is a "gray area" subject to interpretation by a CHP officer and a 
judge. Lane-splitters are liable to get a ticket only when an officer deems 
they are going too fast for the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a judgment call for the officer," Phulps said. "It's the same as getting 
a citation for driving too fast in the fog. Under some conditions, it may be 
unsafe to split lanes at even 5 m.p.h. faster than traffic."

SEWAGE SPILLS HURT BEACH'S REPUTATION; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE PRISTINE REPUTATION OF LAGUNA BEACH HAS BEEN MUDDIED, MANY FEAR, BY 
THE THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WASTE THAT HAVE POLLUTED THE OCEAN AFTER SEWER 
SYSTEM BREAKDOWNS IN RECENT YEARS.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some call this beachside retreat the Monte Carlo of the California Riviera, a 
resort city that prides itself on progressive thought, a cast of colorful 
characters and a villagelike atmosphere harkening to a quieter, more peaceful 
time. 
</P>
<P>
For many Laguna residents, in fact, it is a constant source of pride that their 
community seems so out of step with the relative blandness of surrounding 
Orange County. In a fast-growing area where development often emphasizes tract 
homes and malls, Laguna Beach has always managed to maintain its quirkiness and 
its bucolic setting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in spite of its efforts to preserve its pristine image, Laguna today is 
finding its magical reputation tainted by the very kind of problems that it has 
tried so hard to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
And more often than local residents like to admit, the problems involve a 
series of sewage spills that have dumped thousands of gallons of raw wastes on 
the scenic beaches of this South County playground. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the spills have been caused by breakdowns in the city's sewer system. 
According to city records, there have been more than a dozen spills in the past 
two years, many of them requiring temporary closure of some of Laguna's most 
popular beaches. 
</P>
<P>
City officials recently agreed to spend $300,000 to install a telemetry system 
that will immediately alert officials of power outages at the 23 sewage pumping 
stations. They say most of the spills have been the result of power outages. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly I don't know what else we can do about (the sewage problem) except 
what we are already doing," said Mayor Robert F. Gentry. "It's a real concern 
of ours. I don't care as much about our reputation as I do about the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the causes, the specter of raw sewage spilled across the white sands 
of Laguna Beach has residents upset and businessmen worried that the 
multimillion-dollar tourist trade could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future, people are going to look at coastal cities and decide where 
they are going to spend their time based on what's left of the environment," 
says Evan David, who owns a local design business. "They've all got 7-Elevens 
and yogurt shops but they don't all have sewage." 
</P>
<P>
While some city officials maintain that too much has been made of the spills, 
others see it as a serious threat to the special reputation that Laguna Beach 
has acquired over the years as a city with sincere concerns about people and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
It is Laguna, after all, that played host to a migration of hippies and flower 
children 20 years ago and has gained a worldwide reputation for its art 
festivals, vistas and tolerance of non-traditional life styles. And it is here, 
residents boast, that Hare Krishnas, conservative Republicans and homosexuals 
live side-by-side in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Life styles aside, all seem to agree that something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," said one resident, who would only identify himself as a city 
employee. "Laguna Beach is one of the richest cities in the world and we have a 
sewer spill every week." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I have a film on me when I get out of the water," added Laguna 
Beach chiropractor Garrett Andersen. "One of my friends got ill and got the 
runs after a spill." 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen fear the frequent spills have already begun to scare away the 
tourists. At stake, they say, are some 3 million visitors a year and millions 
of tourist dollars. "It's terrible for business. People come flocking down here 
to the beach with their stuff and they leave cursing," says Mick Rasley, who 
owns a silversmith shop on South Coast Highway. "They could stay and walk 
(around) the shops but they're so mad, they leave." 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a palm tree frond fell on a power line and shut off electricity 
at one pumping station. Fortunately, only 100 gallons of sewage overflowed and 
officials were able to stop it before it reached the water, said Terry Brandt, 
city director of municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
But they haven't always been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
In January, spills from pipes crossing beneath Aliso Creek dumped 170,000 
gallons of sewage into the surf. In March, 300,000 gallons made its way to the 
surf. In June, more than 900,000 gallons hit the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Then of course, there's the smell. 
</P>
<P>
"It smells like rotten eggs," said Scott Young, 30, another resident, 
describing the beach after one spill. "I'm afraid to go in the water after one 
because I don't want to get hepatitis or something." 
</P>
<P>
According to county health officials, water contaminated with sewage can cause 
stomach problems. They post the contaminated sections of beach with red and 
white signs when it is not safe to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers "hassle us but we say, it's purely your choice," said Mike Dwinell, a 
lifeguard at Main Beach. "This is what you can get if you go in there. It's an 
inconvenience but I wonder, where do these people think (waste) all goes?" 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Ryan, managing director of the local Chamber of Commerce, is one who 
says too much is being made of the spills. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to discourage people from coming down here because the spills 
were made out to be more than they really were," she said. "I think it would 
take a lot more than that to tarnish the city's image." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sewage has been the topic of more than one bad joke lately. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell when the sewage is out there because the birds stay on the beach 
and won't go in the water," said stockbroker Art Sonce. "I think the problem 
is, this area was not built to hold all these people. It just can't take the 
load."

POLLING PLACES WILL BE FEWER AND FARTHER APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters accustomed to visiting their neighborhood polling places may have to go 
a little farther to cast their ballots Tuesday, when less than half the usual 
number of polling places will be open for the off-year election. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say there will be 872 polling places open on Tuesday, compared 
to about 2,150 in a primary or general election with national or statewide 
races, and fewer than in any countywide election this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The number of polling places has been reduced mainly because in an off-year 
election, only about 10% to 12% of the electorate goes to the polls, compared 
to about 70% in a general election. 
</P>
<P>
The 872 polling places are about 300 to 400 fewer than in past off-year 
elections, when up to 1,271 polls have been open. County Registrar of Voters 
Donald Tanney said that after monitoring voting patterns for the past two 
years, he determined that fewer polls were needed. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the number of polling places by 300 should not have an adverse effect 
on voting and will save the county about $75,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That to me is significant money," he said. "In the past, with 1,200 polls and 
10% turnout, (poll workers) sat around with nothing to do all day." 
</P>
<P>
Tanney said voters were informed of their polling places on sample ballots 
mailed recently by his office. 
</P>
<P>
"We just presume that they will look at it," Tanney said. "If they go to the 
wrong place, they'll figure it out. It'll be different, not necessarily 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
There are several municipal issues on Tuesday's ballot, including Irvine's 
controversial Measure N, which seeks to remove gays from the protection of the 
city's human rights ordinance, and La Palma's Measure Q, which would impose a 
4% utility user's tax to raise money for city services. There also are 
elections in eight local school districts and in the Coast Community College 
District, and a recall election in Fountain Valley. But for about 45% of the 
county's voters, Measure M will be the only item on the ballot, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M would increase the county's sales tax a half-cent to raise about $3.1 
billion over the next 20 years for widening and improving highways, creating 
"super streets" and synchronizing traffic signals, as well as other 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Measure M, who have raised more than $1.8 million for their 
campaign, have been most concerned about voter turnout. Polls have shown 
consistently that while supporters of Measure M outnumber opponents, those 
against the half-cent tax are are more likely to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical off-year election, about 10% to 12% of the county's voters go to 
the polls. Measure M proponents have indicated that the countywide proposal is 
in jeopardy if turnout drops below 25%. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the smaller number of polling places has been something of a 
hurdle, the measure's supporters say. How much of a problem it is "we'll know 
on election day," said Alan Hoffenblum, manager of the Measure M campaign. 
"We're doing everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
To combat the normally low turnout for off-year elections, the Measure M 
campaign has launched a major effort to get people to vote by absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE BALLOT 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed sales tax for transportation projects, is the only 
countywide issue facing all 1.15 million registered voters on Tuesday, but more 
than a fourth of the Orange County's voters also will have a chance to decide 
school board races, cityhood and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Elections in Orange County on Tuesday include: 
</P>
<P>
* Countywide: Measure M, a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for an estimated 
$3.1 billion in traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine: Measure N, an initiative sponsored by anti-gay-rights activists 
seeking to remove homosexuals from protection under the city's Human Rights 
Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
* Laguna Niguel: Measure O, a cityhood proposal for residents who now live in 
an unincorporated area administered by the county. Also on the area ballot is 
Measure P, which asks voters to decide whether City Council members should be 
elected by district or at-large, if a majority of voters approve cityhood. 
Voters also will be asked to choose five City Council members from among 23 
candidates. In addition, residents will be asked to vote for two incumbents to 
continue serving on the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, should 
cityhood fail. 
</P>
<P>
* La Palma: Voters will consider Measure Q, a proposed 4% utility users tax to 
raise money for the city's general fund and the Police and Recreation 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
* Newport Beach: Measure R would authorize the city to extend for 10 years the 
current lease on property at Coast Highway and Newport Boulevard to encourage 
private redevelopment of the site. The current lease to private businesses 
there expires in 2008. Also in Newport Beach, voters will consider Measure S, 
which would allow the sale of an unused, vacant, $350,000 city-owned lot on 
River Avenue to raise money for libraries and parks. 
</P>
<P>
* Fountain Valley: Voters will decide whether to recall City Councilman Fred 
Voss, who was arrested last January for soliciting sex from an undercover 
police officer during a crackdown on prostitution. Voters also will decide 
whether Voss' successor shall be elected or appointed if the recall is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
* Voters will elect two trustees each in the Coast Community College District 
and Garden Grove Unified, Irvine Unified and Santa Ana Unified school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
* Three trustees each will be selected in the Newport-Mesa Unified, Huntington 
Beach Union High, Anaheim City and Lowell Joint school districts. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Orange Unified School District, voters will choose four trustees to 
serve four-year terms, and one to fill the remaining two years of an unexpired 
term. 
</P>
<P>
* Voters will elect four trustees in the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
* Property owners in the Los Alisos Water District will choose two directors 
from among three candidates. The district includes parts of Lake Forest and El 
Toro, and land owners cast one vote for each dollar of their assessed property 
value by mail-in ballot.

TOP DRUNK-NABBERS HONORED BY MADD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officers Karl Schuler and Mike Cohen remember nights when the back seat of 
their patrol car was full of folks -- all drunk-driving suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Cohen and Schuler arrested 430 people on suspicion of drunk driving 
while working as partners on a three-month assignment to Costa Mesa's Drunk 
Driving Enforcement Team, a record for law enforcement teams in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it," said Schuler, a 14-year veteran on the force. "We're just two 
guys in one patrol car. And when you make that many arrests, you spend a lot of 
time in the station booking people. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be an uncountable number who get away. There were nights when we 
would be on our way back to the station with more than one drunk driver in the 
back seat of the patrol car and we would see another one. One time we had as 
many as four in the car at once," Schuler said. "We arrested one guy twice: 
once during the beginning of our watch in April and again near the end of our 
assignment in June. He remembered us." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that several drivers they arrested were apprehended again by the 
next team of Costa Mesa police officers assigned to the special patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't getting the message somehow. We could go right out there again 
and arrest just as many, probably more. But still I'm glad to have brought in 
as many as we did. It saved lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were honored along with other Orange County law enforcement officers 
Friday night at an awards banquet in Irvine sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. Awards were given to officers nominated by their departments for their 
efforts to curb drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa has the highest drunk-driving apprehension rate in the county this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Six other officers from the department were honored at the banquet, including 
partners Marty Carver and Scott May, who have made more than 1,000 
drunk-driving arrests in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler said the special teams have helped the department fine-tune the arrest 
procedure. Fellow officers on regular patrol also stop drunk-driving suspects 
and then call in the enforcement team to handle the sobriety test and booking 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total team effort with everybody's time utilized effectively. Even 
the clerical staff helps out by typing reports we dictate instead of writing 
them up ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Schuler credits the streamlined paper work system designed by Police Chief 
David Snowden for helping make the arrests stick. 
</P>
<P>
"The drunk-driving arrest form is so simple that even a layman could fill it 
out right the first time. It keeps us from making paper work errors or 
neglecting to take down important evidence." The department has a 95% 
conviction rate, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only had to appear in court twice so far, and both defendants were 
convicted," he said. JANICE L. JONES

COUNCIL TO WEIGH ELECTION MEASURES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider three measures regarding elections at its 
meeting tonight. First, it is expected to vote again on whether to move local 
elections from April to November. After much debate and public comment, it 
approved the change by a 3-2 vote last month but must re-introduce it to make a 
technical change. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Councilman Earl J. Prescott, the council also will 
consider putting an advisory measure on the issue on the November, 1990, 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think that any three council members should have the opportunity 
to play yo-yo with the voting dates," said Prescott, who along with John Kelly 
voted against moving the elections from April. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the request of Kelly, the council will consider asking voters to decide 
whether to increase the number of council members from five to seven and 
whether to elect council members by district. If Kelly's suggestion is 
approved, the measure would be before voters in the November, 1990, election. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes along pretty much with the idea of open government and fair, 
equitable representation throughout the city," Kelly said. "When I first began 
running for office (in 1980), four out of five council members lived in Tustin 
Meadows and Peppertree." SHANNON SANDS

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SENIOR HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal for a senior citizen housing development that has angered some 
neighbors will be considered by the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The 179-unit, three-story project, called Valley View Senior Villas, is planned 
for 2.8 acres at 12200 Valley View St., south of Chapman Avenue, in west Garden 
Grove. Some residents in the area have argued that the buildings would generate 
too much traffic, block their views and invade their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's Planning Commission approved the project Aug. 24, and the City 
Council considered it on Oct. 2. At that time, the council voted to reschedule 
the matter for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The city has received letters from both proponents and opponents of the plan.

PIER REPAIRS TO BEGIN AFTER SEWER IS DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repairs to the storm-damaged San Clemente Pier are expected to begin later this 
month, after workers finish installing a sewer line in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The $68,400 sewer project, started last week, includes replacing pipes that 
were installed under the railroad tracks in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
The $110,000 pier project will replace 20 pilings and several support beams 
that were damaged by waves in a storm last winter. It is expected to be 
complete by mid-December. The city is paying for both projects.

A Yorba Linda man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of murder in connection with 
the beating death of a Cerritos man who was assaulted by five young people 
wielding baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
Joffrey Deleon Lagadia, 18, was arrested in the afternoon at his home, a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said, and was being held without bail at the 
Lakewood Sheriff's Station.

About 1:20 a.m. Sunday, authorities said, Miguel Sanchez, 19, had stopped his 
car at Vickie Avenue and Artesia Boulevard in Cerritos, where he was confronted 
by youths who shouted gang slogans and challenged him to a fight. When Sanchez 
left his car, he was severely beaten on the head, Deputy Bill Wehner said. 
Sanchez died Sunday afternoon at Pioneer Hospital in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Lagadia was the only suspect arrested as of Sunday. Detectives were seeking

SPILL CLOSES PORTION OF CHINO HILLS PARK 
</P>

<P>
Several acres of the Chino Hills State Park remained closed this weekend as 
efforts continued to clean up a chemical spill that contaminated a creek bed 
and caused a chemical burn on one bicyclist, state officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 466 gallons of water containing a high level of sodium hydroxide 
-- a powdered chemical commonly added to drinking water -- apparently leaked 
into the Telegraph Canyon creek south of Carbon Canyon Road for several days 
before it was discovered on Oct. 28, a Department of Fish and Game warden said. 
</P>
<P>
A cyclist on a mountain bike crossed the creek and later felt an itching and 
burning sensation on his feet, warden Ralph Sugg said. The cyclist went to a 
local hospital, and physicians diagnosed his ailment as a "chemical burn," Sugg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous material specialists with the Brea and Orange County fire departments 
traced the chemical leak to the Metropolitan Water District's Diemer filtration 
plant on a ridge above Telegraph Canyon, less than a half mile from the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the water carrying the chemical was slowly trickling out of a 
pressure relief valve," Sugg said. "MWD quickly sealed it off, but the cleanup 
is going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
Sodium hydroxide is added to public drinking water supplies to prevent lead and 
acid buildup. When diluted in large water supplies, such as reservoirs, the 
chemical poses no health hazard. But when humans are exposed to the widely used 
industrial chemical in large concentrations, it can cause eye and skin 
irritation. 
</P>
<P>
The 466 gallons of water that contaminated the creek had a "50% solution" of 
sodium hydroxide, Sugg said. He estimated that about a half mile of the creek 
was polluted, including three to four feet of soil on either side of the creek 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
Telegraph Canyon is on the western edge of the 11,000-acre Chino Hills State 
Park, and the dirt road that runs through the canyon and along the creek is 
popular among hikers, cyclists and horse riders. But it remained closed Sunday 
as cleanup crews continued to remove tainted soil and vegetation from the creek 
bottom. A chain-link fence has been erected across the road, and the MWD has 
posted guards to keep outsiders away. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Black, an Anaheim resident who often rides horses in the canyon, said he 
was angered Sunday when the guards refused to disclose why the trail had been 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've got a toxic chemical down in the dirt, why are they keeping this so 
hush-hush?" he asked. "This is a state park bordering on several large 
communities. I think people have a right to know." 
</P>
<P>
Sugg said the spill is under investigation by state Fish and Game, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and the state Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Sugg said the cleanup is time-consuming because of the thick vegetation that 
lines the narrow creek and canyon bottom. Sugg said officials want to preserve 
as much of the brush and trees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We could take bulldozers and just level that area, and get that dirt out," he 
said. "But that's not the way to do it. We don't want to disturb any more of 
the area than necessary."

PHONE LINES CUT AT OFFICE OF TEACHERS UNION

<P>
The telephone lines were found cut Sunday at the office of the Orange Unified 
School District teachers union, whose members walked precincts in opposition to 
an incumbent school board candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange police said they had no motive or suspects in the case, a 
spokeswoman for the Orange Unified Education Assn. said members suspect that 
supporters of school board incumbent Joe J. Cherry were responsible. The union 
is opposing Cherry and is supporting two of his challengers in Tuesday's 
election to the Orange Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry, 57, a 16-year veteran of the school board who is seeking his fifth 
term, disavowed any knowledge of the incident when contacted at home late 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first I've heard about this," Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were notified of the downed phone lines and the allegation, but Sgt. 
John Richard said no evidence tying Cherry or his supporters to the incident 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said the four telephone lines leading from a connector box in the back 
of the union headquarters building on 349 E. Grove St. were all found cleanly 
cut. Richard said the line cutting took place sometime between 4 p.m. Saturday, 
when union workers were last in the building, and 2 p.m. Sunday, when they 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about all we know so far," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Vaugine, political action committee chair for the Orange Unified 
Education Assn., said the lines had been cut sometime during the day as union 
members walked precincts. She and several others returned to the group's office 
across from Schaffer Park to phone voters and found the phones were dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a really crummy, last-minute trick," Vaugine said. "It essentially 
knocks us out until Monday morning, and we lose almost a whole day of phone 
time. It the worst kind of politics." 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Stover, president of the 1,100-member teachers' union, said Sunday that 
while she was not accusing anyone of cutting the lines, she had no doubt that 
the incident was election-related.

MILLARD AND CO. KEEP THE PRESSURE ON EVERETT MOST OF DAY

<P>
Ram guards Tom Newberry and Duval Love fought a battle royal on the line of 
scrimmage with Viking pass rusher extraordinaire Keith Millard Sunday, and all 
three players won some rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Millard and the Vikings won the war, however. Ram quarterback Jim Everett 
completed 18 of 30 passes for 200 yards and a touchdown, but he was constantly 
harassed by Millard. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were pinned inside their 10-yard line in the second quarter when 
Everett completed a 25-yard pass to Henry Ellard, who made a diving catch. But 
Newberry was called for holding Millard. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Newberry dragged Millard down by the face mask just in time to keep 
the Viking tackle from flattening Everett. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the second half, Millard made Everett pay heavily for a 
three-yard completion to Robert Delpino, slamming the Ram quarterback to the 
artificial surface as he released the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams finally got decent field position late in the third quarter after Mel 
Owens' interception gave them the ball on the Viking 30. But Millard almost 
single-handedly ended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell ran for one yard on first down. On second down, Millard burst through 
the middle, forcing Everett to spin away into onrushing defensive end Chris 
Doleman, who sacked him for a 15-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
On third down, Millard shook off a block by Newberry and chased Everett out of 
the pocket. Everett's hurried throw went through the hands of Bell, and the 
Rams had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 2:14 left in regulation and the Rams at the Viking 14, Millard 
slammed into Everett as he delivered a pass to Buford McGee. The ball glanced 
off McGee's hands and Joey Browner made a flying interception. 
</P>
<P>
"They look offsides half the time because they're so fast," Ram Coach John 
Robinson said. "You have to give credit to the Vikings' defense." 
</P>
<P>
Some quick thinking on the part of the Minnesota offensive unit helped the 
Vikings to a 12-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota had the ball on the Ram 12-yard line with 18 seconds left when 
quarterback Wade Wilson couldn't find a receiver and decided to scramble. 
Wilson sprinted up the middle, but was upended at the Ram 3 with the Vikings 
out of timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The field goal unit started onto the field, but center Kirk Lowdermilk snapped 
the ball to Wilson, who threw it onto the ground. Minnesota had about 20 
players on the field, but Lowdermilk and Wilson had managed to stop the clock 
with two seconds remaining. Rich Karlis then kicked his fourth field goal, a 
25-yarder, to put the Vikings ahead by five at the half. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a wild one, like a Chinese fire drill," Karlis said. "But fortunately 
we knocked that one in, too, because we needed every one today." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings figured their offense was pretty offensive Sunday, but a victory is 
a victory. Still, seven field goals and a safety was not exactly what they had 
in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense didn't really get anything done today," said Hassan Jones, whose 
catch of Wilson's Hail Mary pass set up the game-tying field goal. "We got the 
ball down inside the 10, the 20 and the 30, but we were not able to put it in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue to rely on the defense. They're playing great, but as an 
offense, we've got to score some touchdowns. We have to perform better and do 
the things we're capable of (doing)." 
</P>
<P>
Wanna bet?: Merriweather's inability to corral the bouncing ball in the end 
zone after blocking Hatcher's punt didn't make any difference in the outcome or 
the standings, but it certainly affected more than a few bettors around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings were favored by 4 1/2 points, and if Merriweather had covered the 
ball for a touchdown, Minnesota would have covered the spread. Instead the Rams 
won, with the points. 
</P>
<P>
Going and coming dept.: With 28 seconds remaining in regulation, hordes of fans 
began filing out of the Metrodome, clogging the aisles and tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty seconds of playing time later, Karlis made his National Football 
League-record tying seventh field goal, and the fans came rushing back to their 
seats. A lot of them were still in the aisles when Mike Merriweather blocked 
Dale Hatcher's punt for the safety that sealed the Rams' fourth consecutive 
loss.

PAPAZIAN RELISHES ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT DOESN'T REVEL IN THEM 
</P>

<P>
As the star football player at Whittier Christian High School in La Habra, Ron 
Papazian lives the life of a typical, zealously athletic 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall of his bedroom is a photograph of his favorite football player, 
Gaston Green. On the family's refrigerator is a picture of heavyweight champion 
Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"That's to give him incentive to build a bigger body," said Papazian's mother, 
Maxine. "He thinks Mike Tyson has an awesome body." 
</P>
<P>
But aside from a few trophies and photographs of himself with his teammates, 
Papazian, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound fullback/linebacker, keeps few mementos of his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, it's his parents who have to remind him how close he is to breaking 
the Orange County single-season touchdown record. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring three touchdowns in Whittier Christian's 21-18 Olympic League 
victory over Valley Christian Friday night, Papazian moved into the sixth spot 
on the county list for single-season touchdowns with 28. He shares that 
position with Willie Gittens, the former Fountain Valley standout who did it in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian needs five touchdowns to break the county record of 32 set five years 
ago by Jim Farrell of Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Papazian is averaging three touchdowns a game, breaking the 
record seems a realistic goal. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (9-0 overall, 4-0 in league) has one regular-season game 
remaining -- at Miraleste on Saturday -- before entering the Division IX 
playoffs. The Heralds are ranked second in that division, behind top-ranked 
Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, however, that Whittier Christian, which has outscored 
opponents, 330-64, this season, does not rely entirely on Papazian. Although 
Papazian's 168 points account for 50.9% of his team's total, Scott Jordan has 
nine touchdowns and Mike Coelho has kicked five field goals and 46 extra 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Papazian is the star of the team, although he doesn't get caught up 
in the hype. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a real big deal," said Papazian, who is the county's 
fourth-leading rusher with 1,160 yards in 165 carries, a seven-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I'm glad I almost have the county record or whatever, but it's not like 
(it's been) one of my goals since the beginning of the year. Now that I'm this 
close, I do want to break it, though." 
</P>
<P>
Said his mother: "He is very unaffected by it. In fact, we tell him, 'You're 
tied for sixth in the county for touchdowns,' or 'You only need so many to 
break it,' but he's never been like that. He's a low-key guy. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's an article about him he doesn't come home and say, 'Is there 
anything in the papers about me today?' He just takes things in stride." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it's the same with his coach, Phil Bravo. When asked about 
Papazian's touchdown count, Bravo said: "How many touchdowns does he have 
anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I'm just oblivious to that fact, to be honest," Bravo said. "I'm not 
kidding you, I don't even keep track of those things . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's not to the point where we're near the goal line and people are saying, 
'Well, let's get the ball to Ron so he can get the record.' That's about 19th 
on the priority list, if even that." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the five touchdowns Papazian scored in Whittier Christian's 74-0 
romp over Brethren last month? 
</P>
<P>
"He only had nine carries at halftime," Bravo said. "He finished with 15 for 
the game. He normally carries 24 times a game. And really, he could've scored 
10." 
</P>
<P>
Add Whittier Christian: Friday's victory was the first time the Heralds have 
defeated Valley Christian in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the school held a rally and a bonfire to inspire the players. And 
Friday, a standing-room only crowd of 3,500 -- about 10 times the normal 
attendence -- packed the stands at Valley Christian in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the county's hottest football league races, standings and 
playoff possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
Angelus League: Bishop Amat (5-3, 3-0) is in first place. Mater Dei (5-4, 2-1), 
which is tied for second with St. Paul (4-5, 2-1), meets Servite (3-6, 1-2) 
Thursday. After losing to Bishop Amat, 27-6, Servite will not receive a playoff 
berth, breaking its streak of 18 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Century League: Santa Ana (7-2, 3-1) and Villa Park (6-3, 3-1) are tied for 
first, with Santa Ana Valley (3-5-1, 2-2), which lost to Villa Park on 
Saturday, in second. 
</P>
<P>
Empire League: Los Alamitos (8-1, 4-0) is in first, but must beat Esperanza 
(6-3, 3-1) Friday to win the league title. Loara (7-1, 3-1) is tied for second 
with Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway League: Sunny Hills (9-0, 4-0) leads, with Troy (6-3, 3-1) in second 
and Fullerton (6-3, 2-2) tied for third with La Habra (4-5, 2-2). La Habra and 
Fullerton play Thursday for the No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove League: Pacifica (6-2, 6-0) has clinched the league championship. 
Kennedy (5-4, 4-2) is tied for second with La Quinta (5-4, 4-2). 
</P>
<P>
Olympic League: Whittier Christian needs to beat Miraleste this week to win the 
league title outright. If Whittier Christian loses and Valley Christian wins, 
the Heralds share the title with Valley Christian. Santa Margarita (6-3, 4-3) 
clinched third place by defeating Orange Lutheran, 42-0. 
</P>
<P>
Orange League: Valencia (8-0, 3-0) and Savanna (5-3-1, 3-0) are tied for first. 
Western, which lost Saturday to Valencia, 15-7, is third. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast League: Trabuco Hills (8-1, 4-0) and Orange (7-1-1, 4-0) are tied 
for first and play for the league title Thursday at Mission Viejo High School. 
Laguna Hills (4-5, 2-2) is in third. 
</P>
<P>
Sea View League: Estancia (9-0, 4-0) clinched the league title with a 17-12 
victory over Tustin Friday. Tustin (6-3, 2-1) is in second. Corona del Mar 
(6-3, 2-2) and Newport Harbor (6-3, 2-2) are tied for third and play Friday at 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast League: The biggest game in the county will be Friday when El Toro, 
the No. 1-ranked county team meets No. 2 Capistrano Valley. Both teams are 9-0 
overall and 4-0 in league play. Mission Viejo (7-2, 2-2) is tied for third with 
Dana Hills (6-3, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Sunset League: Huntington Beach (7-2, 3-1), Edison (6-3, 3-1) and Ocean View 
(6-3, 3-1) are tied for first. Fourth-place Fountain Valley (4-5, 2-2) has a 
chance for a playoff spot if it beats Huntington Beach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Quotable: Gene Noji, Woodbridge football coach, after his team fell to 3-6 
overall last week: "We haven't been singing too many songs on the bus on the 
way back to school." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Whitaker, Foothill cross-country coach, after his girls' team won the 
Century League title and his boys' finished sixth out of six teams: "It was a 
Jekyll and Hyde day for us, you know, schizophrenic. Our guys ran (poorly), our 
girls were nails." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's basketball team will travel to St. Louis on Dec. 7 to play East St. 
Louis Lincoln in the annual St. Louis Shootout. The shootout features four St. 
Louis area teams against some of the top teams in the nation. Among the top 
prep players scheduled to compete: 7-5 center Shawn Bradley of Emery County 
High in Utah, forward Anfernee Hardaway of Memphis Treadwell and forward Brian 
Reese of Bronx St. Nicholas of Tolentine. The field features three defending 
state champions, including St. Nicholas of Tolentine, last season's mythical 
national champion. The shootout has been sold out three consecutive years and 
has included former prep All-Americans Danny Ferry, Alonzo Mourning and Kenny 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills will host a free youth basketball coaches clinic at 7 p.m. 
Tuesday in the school's gymnasium. Featured speakers include Trabuco Hills 
Coach Rainer Wulf and former Laguna Hills Coach John Moore. Among the 
fundamentals to be discussed are shooting, man-to-man defense, full-court press 
and fast-break offense.

MCCORKLE SAYS HE WILL SIGN WITH SYRACUSE

<P>
Scott McCorkle of Capistrano Valley High School, a member of The Times' 
All-County basketball team last season, will sign a national letter of intent 
to attend Syracuse, he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle, 6-feet-5, led Capistrano Valley to a 20-4 overall record and the 
Southern Section 5-A title last year as a junior, when he averaged 24.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle said a factor in his decision was the recommendation of his friend, 
Mike Hopkins, a former Mater Dei player who is a redshirt freshman at Syracuse. 
Wednesday is the first day seniors can sign national letters of intent for 
basketball.

McCorkle also visited California, Loyola Marymount and UC Irvine.

Pacific Symphony will move its administrative offices from Santa Ana to Irvine 
on Dec. 1, officials announced Friday. The organization will keep its Santa Ana 
facility, which it gets rent-free from the city, for rehearsal and production 
work. The new Irvine offices, at 2151 Michelson Drive, have been donated by 
board member and developer Warren Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana facility "has been in need of repair since we took occupancy in 
1985, and we've been working with the city of Santa Ana to seek the necessary 
funds in order to make the health and safety changes necessary," executive 
director Louis G. Spisto said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said that the donation of space is worth $30,000 a year to the Pacific.

AMPHITHEATERS SHOW DIP IN ATTENDANCE, BOOKINGS; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERTS: WHILE THE SEASON WAS THE "LIGHTEST IN YEARS" FOR ORANGE COUNTY AND 
THE NATION, EXPERTS EXPECT OUTDOOR ENTERTAINMENT TO REBOUND. 
</P>

<P>
After setting records for bookings and attendance in 1988, Orange County's two 
large amphitheaters found leaner pickings during the recently concluded 1989 
outdoor concert season. 
</P>
<P>
The intense annual competition between the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa 
and the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine finished in a dead heat in terms 
of number of shows. Each venue staged 36 concerts -- a marked decline from 1988 
totals of 55 shows at the Pacific and 45 at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Total attendance at Irvine Meadows "approached 400,000 people," according to 
Bob Geddes, the amphitheater's managing partner -- down from almost 500,000 in 
1988. Attendance at the Pacific Amphitheatre was about 300,000, according to 
spokeswoman Laura Gold -- down from 410,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the season not only in Orange County, but nationally, 
was the lightest we've seen in many, many years," Geddes said. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't as many tours out in general, and there weren't as many bigger 
shows out," said Alex Hodges, the vice president in charge of West Coast 
concert promotion for the Nederlander Organization, which runs the Pacific 
Amphitheatre. "There were some real elements of a good season (at the Pacific), 
but there were too many dark nights." 
</P>
<P>
One element completely missing from the Pacific's season was heavy-metal rock. 
Instead, the Pacific offered a schedule dominated by acts with roots in the 
'60s and '70s. The parade of Boomer-oriented acts included Rod Stewart, Elton 
John, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Carole King, the Jefferson Airplane 
and the Doobie Brothers 
</P>
<P>
Heavy metal, with its younger audiences, was a staple at Irvine Meadows, where 
10 metal shows made up nearly a third of the theater's 31 pop music offerings 
(the Irvine Meadows schedule also included five concerts by the Pacific 
Symphony). Two of metal's hottest draws, Bon Jovi and Metallica, each played 
three shows at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Amphitheatre is involved in a continuing lawsuit in which 
neighboring homeowners claim that the amphitheater is a source of noise 
pollution. Could that have led amphitheater officials to shy away from booking 
earsplitting metal bands? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to suggest that I'm de-emphasizing or emphasizing anything" in 
concert bookings because of the noise controversy, Hodges said. The Pacific 
Amphitheatre did announce one early season show by the heavy metal band Poison, 
but it was canceled when the band's singer developed voice problems. Hodges 
said he also made bids for some of the metal acts that wound up playing at 
Irvine Meadows instead of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's incumbent upon us to have some shows that attract younger people, 
and get a broad base," Hodges said. "We feel we offer diversity, but more 
diversity would be great." 
</P>
<P>
Geddes echoed the idea that diversity is a key to success. "I think Irvine is 
typically perceived as the more rock 'n' roll venue," he said, but it isn't an 
image that Irvine Meadows is trying to cultivate. The goal, he said, is to book 
the biggest possible draws, regardless of genre. "We want to make sure we 
appeal to a broad base of people. We did for a number of years go to a rather 
strict diet of rock 'n' roll. Now we try to balance it." 
</P>
<P>
After this year's drop-off, both amphitheaters are looking toward a rebound in 
1990, when some major acts that took time off from touring this year return to 
the road. "It's a cyclical business," Geddes said. "Next year appears to be the 
antithesis of this year."

THE BUTTERFLIES GO ALONG WITH SARAH BRIGHTMAN ON TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMING: THE STAR OF "THE MUSIC OF ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER IN CONCERT" CONSIDERS 
CONCERTIZING RISKIER THAN PLAYING A CHARACTER IN A MUSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a top-secret location in San Francisco, Sarah Brightman was being held 
hostage to fame last week. She could not reveal where she was. Nor could her 
publicist, who said separately from New York that Brightman was under strict 
orders from her husband, Andrew Lloyd Webber, not to disclose her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
But in a voice that sounded bell-like even through the telephone line, the 
singer did allow that she was "very much cocooned" or "very much marooned" -- 
the words were less clear than the voice -- in an ordinary hotel room with blue 
walls and blue and white curtains. "I've got a bathroom," she added. "There's a 
piano and an exercise bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
Although her road accommodations seemed a bit of a comedown from her usual igs 
-- the nine-room duplex she shares with her husband in Manhattan's Trump Tower; 
their 1,350-acre estate in Hampshire, England; their seaside villa on the 
French Riviera; their Belgravia flat in London -- Brightman could rest assured 
that she was safely ensconced at an unbreachable distance from the kooks and 
the cranks. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she felt unsettled. For all her well-arranged seclusion, the inevitable 
butterflies had found her -- attracted no doubt by the high expectations she 
has for her current national tour of "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in 
Concert." The butterflies had found her in Milwaukee, followed her from Chicago 
to Denver, and at that moment in San Francisco, where she was about to give her 
first West Coast performance, they were fluttering in her stomach again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine, but I'm nervous," said Brightman, who is to begin a 12-day 
engagement Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
"I'm nervous wherever I open. I'm always nervous. I suppose that's just part of 
(performing). They say when you're not nervous, you should stop." 
</P>
<P>
The former star of Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" said she finds 
concertizing considerably riskier than playing a character in a visually 
spectacular musical because the essentials are laid bare. "You can't hide 
behind the sets or the costumes," she said. "In the concert hall, the audience 
has come for your voice and your personality." 
</P>
<P>
Brightman, a soprano, is backed on this tour by a 60-piece orchestra and 
supplemented by a company of singers. She said the idea for the concert 
originated two years ago with a more modest evening of songs that she and her 
husband had put together at London's Barbican Centre. Its success, she said, 
prompted them to develop a an anthology of 23 tunes from eight of his musicals 
over two decades. 
</P>
<P>
With songs from the early "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" to the 
less-well-known "Requiem" and "Song and Dance," the concert is intended for 
"people of my generation who haven't seen all of Andrew's shows," said 
Brightman, who is 29. 
</P>
<P>
The program is also something of a poor man's "phantom," with no less than 
seven selections from that musical. Yet,asked which of her husband's songs she 
would take with her to a desert island, Brightman said she wouldn't choose any 
"Phantom" tune. 
</P>
<P>
"I did them for so long, I'm not sure I would sit and listen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More to her liking, Brightman said, are the title song from "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" and "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" from "Evita." Both pop-chart 
anthems of the '70s are included in tonight's program, along with the suite 
from "Starlight Express" and three selections from "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Brightman's former allegiance to rock 'n' roll has apparently 
reasserted itself. The singer, who at 18 joined a group called Hot Gossip after 
deciding she lacked the talent to become a ballet star, said she has just 
completed recording an as-yet-untitled rock album due out early next year. 
</P>
<P>
That would represent a considerable shift from her recent recordings. In 1988 
she made an album of folk songs by Benjamin Britten. Her latest effort, "The 
Songs That Got Away," is a collection of 15 tunes that either flopped or were 
cut from the musicals for which they were written -- by such composers as 
Irving Berlin, Marvin Hamlisch and Leonard Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I really wasn't a huge musical-theater fan as a 
youngster," said Brightman, who nonetheless made her stage debut at 13 in a 
West End production of the Charles Strouse musical "I and Albert." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, she landed in the original London production of "Cats" as a dancer, 
not a singer. It wasn't until she left for "Nightingale," another Strouse 
musical, that her voice got Lloyd Webber's full attention. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, the rest of her had gotten his attention as well. The singer 
and the composer were wed in 1984, after divorcing their previous spouses, and 
swiftly became the musical theater's most celebrated couple. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lucky," Brightman said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she can't help getting butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" will open Tuesday and run 
through Nov. 18. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain this week: Tuesday to Saturday at 8 p.m. Curtain 
next week: Sunday at 2 p.m.; Monday to Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 p.m.

MUSEUM COAXES NOVICES WITH NOVEL EXPERIMENT

<P>
What do you think of when you stand in front of your favorite work of art? Does 
it remind you of somewhere you've been or someone you've known? Is it just, 
somehow, "beautiful"? 
</P>
<P>
Are you impressed by how much someone paid for it? Do you enjoy the formal 
qualities (line, mass, color, brush stroke) of the work? Are you captivated by 
the ideas the piece seems to convey? 
</P>
<P>
Some of these ways of looking are typical of the so-called "naive viewer"; 
others are more typical of people with some background in art. But surely 
everyone would agree that looking at a work of art is a peculiarly specialized 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
There are few things in life -- other than "views" in nature -- that we are 
expected simply to look at for any space of time. For people lacking formal 
training in art, this activity often seems to be nothing short of mystical. 
What the devil are you supposed to think about, anyway, while you're doing all 
this looking? 
</P>
<P>
The closest I've been able to come to "listening in" to people's thoughts about 
art is eavesdropping in local museums. Here's one conversation I jotted down: 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's what I think of as modern art," said a middle-aged man to the 
jolly-sounding middle-aged couple with whom he was touring the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got texture to it," agreed the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who drew this had artistic ability," declared the other man. 
</P>
<P>
The group moved to another painting. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty piece," said the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Color-wise," added the first man, whose voice held a trace of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in contemporary art, that's all it has to be, well-colored," maintained 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, these people had encountered abstract art before, but they seemed to 
lack a frame of reference in which to discuss it. We're all faced with this 
problem when the conversation turns to a subject we don't know much about, 
whether it's the stock market, the national defense budget or the breeding of 
Doberman pinschers. 
</P>
<P>
So how do people become more fluent about the art they see? Most museums 
publish catalogues about their exhibits, but they tend to be written in a 
specialized language that shuts out all but the most patient general reader. 
Museums also organize docent tours of their exhibitions and lectures by 
experts, but these may not be in progress at the moment you've chosen to drop 
in. 
</P>
<P>
It seems logical that information about works of art in museums comes largely 
from the one source that's always standing by: the labels and didactic panels 
on the walls. But exactly what ought to go on those labels is a matter of 
widespread disagreement. Some museum professionals put stock in panels that go 
into detail. Other professionals believe in giving only minimal information so 
as not to spoil the viewer's immediate aesthetic experience. 
</P>
<P>
Long or short, however, labels frequently seem pitched to people who already 
know a lot about art. Where does that leave the intelligent viewer who has 
ventured into alien territory? 
</P>
<P>
An article in a recent issue of Museum News magazine discusses the way one 
museum tried to make labels more viewer-friendly. Funded by grants from the 
Getty Grant Program and the National Endowment for the Arts, the Denver Art 
Museum set out to rethink the way viewers absorb information in gallery labels. 
</P>
<P>
The staff realized that, to quote museum publications director Marlene 
Chambers, the usual thinking behind labels "encourages an outpouring of art 
historical, biographical and cultural information in a setting little suited to 
the acquisition of an organized body of knowledge -- knowledge that's more 
easily acquired in classrooms and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"This traditional approach also ignored the unique experience an art museum has 
to offer -- an immediate experience with art objects," Chambers continues. "By 
handing down all the answers, it sends the implied message that these answers 
can only be discovered by experts. And it cares nothing for motivating what it 
wrongly assumes to be a captive audience." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers and an education department intern decided to experiment with new 
labels for a sentimental painting by 19th-Century artist Adolphe William 
Bouguereau that was apparently a big favorite, based on viewer interviews and 
the number of post card reproductions sold in the museum's bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
The label texts were arranged in two columns: "If you like this painting, it is 
because . . . " and "If you don't like this painting, it is because. . . . " 
Underneath were supporting statements. 
</P>
<P>
On the pro side, for example: "You are charmed by the artist's portrayal of 
youth and innocence." On the con side: "Although you find the subject pleasant, 
it seems trite and uninspired." And so on. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the statements, hidden under a sliding door, a label read: "Is 
your reaction to this painting influenced more by the personal associations you 
bring to it or by the painting itself?" 
</P>
<P>
The third component of the experiment was a brochure comparing the Bouguereau 
painting with a pastel drawing by 19th-Century master Edgar Degas "that most 
visitors barely glance at." 
</P>
<P>
One viewer said the label "made him want to take another look at a contemporary 
painting he had hated on sight." Another viewer said, "Even if I stare at a 
painting for a long time and try to think about it, I never really think about 
position and shape. . . . (That) adds another dimension to the painting." 
</P>
<P>
Surely, much the same type of educational tool -- involving personal discovery 
rather than irrelevant or undigestible masses of facts -- could be devised for 
abstract work and other media. While no museum is likely to want to pursue this 
approach for an entire exhibition, it might be a welcome guide to major pieces 
or especially popular works. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone out there want to give it a whirl?

Unocal Must Pay $10 Million: A federal jury in Miami awarded $10 million to 
Barkett Oil Co., a former service station operation that claimed Union Oil Co. 
of California -- now Unocal Corp. -- violated a federal act governing oil 
company franchises and the distribution of petroleum products. Barkett said it 
suffered financial hardships when the Los Angeles-based company canceled its 
franchise agreement in 1985. Unocal would not say whether it will appeal.

Gas Prices Continue to Slide: A gallon of gasoline costs nearly a penny less 
than it did two weeks ago, thanks to a seasonal downward push and a rise in 
crude oil production, said Trilby Lundberg, who surveys prices at 12,000 
stations nationwide. Between Oct. 20 and Nov. 3, the price of an average gallon 
of gasoline fell 0.95 cents to 108.16 cents. The drop was about twice that 
which occurred in the prior two-week period, said Lundberg.

counting? 
</P>
<P>
Presto Food Products, for one. And Carnation, for another. 
</P>
<P>
Presto, a small City of Industry company, has had the West Coast market for 
liquid non-dairy creamers much to itself since introducing Mocha Mix in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The soy-based creamer, which for 15 years was promoted by Steve Allen and Jayne 
Meadows and is valued by many as a no-cholesterol alternative to milk products, 
last year outsold half-and-half in Southern California, according to Presto. 
And company sales have been rising 20% annually as Presto has embarked on a 
gradual coast-to-coast rollout of Mocha Mix, a "cash cow" that accounts for 
about 25% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
But giant Carnation, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of the Swiss company 
Nestle, is getting set to challenge Mocha Mix come January, when it goes 
nationwide with a new liquid version of its powdered Coffee-mate creamer. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is a product category that industry observers estimate could grow 
within four years from its current $40 million in annual sales at retail to 
more than $150 million as Americans become increasingly aware of cholesterol 
intake, milk allergies and other health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Presto officials liken Carnation's move to Goliath going after David. After 
all, noted Bruce Coffey, Presto's aptly named chairman and chief executive, 
Carnation has the marketing oomph and the distribution system to make a 
national expansion a piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
Presto, on the other hand, has been painstakingly pushing into new markets 
outside its Western region since 1986, attempting to develop a national 
following. Mocha Mix is now in Kansas City, Denver, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
several cities in Texas and Florida. By year-end it should be in Minneapolis, 
Milwaukee, Detroit and Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"Our success obviously attracted others," Coffey said in an interview at 
Presto's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1937 as a manufacturer of aerosol whipped cream for the 
food trade, Presto has grown by getting into profitable product segments with 
limited competition. It projects $83 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making Mocha Mix creamer, it packages and sells frozen desserts 
under the Mocha Mix and Jon Donaire labels and packages private-label non-dairy 
creamers and whipped toppings for such merchants as Vons and Ralphs. It is the 
largest producer of individual creamer packets in Southern California and has a 
sizable food service division that sells creamers, toppings, dressings and 
seasonings to restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Key to Presto's success, Coffey said, has been finding "special niches where we 
could do a good job." Although the company does not disclose earnings, Coffey 
said profit growth "has kept up with sales," which have ratcheted up at a 20% 
rate since 1985's $40.4-million level. 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company is owned by relatives of founder Melvin S. Morse, 
who died in 1983. Coffey, who has an MBA from UCLA and was formerly a vice 
president of Chase Manhattan Bank, is married to Morse's daughter Marty and has 
been with Presto since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheading much of Presto's growth is Glynn Morris, a 20-plus-year Carnation 
veteran who joined Presto last January and was recently promoted to president 
and chief operating officer. Morris hastens to note that he never worked on the 
Coffee-mate team at Carnation. 
</P>
<P>
But he has followed that product's progress closely as it has undergone testing 
in Denver and Dallas this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience . . . shows that they have been able to gain significant market 
share very quickly due to their name and our pioneering work," Morris said of 
Carnation's marketing effort. "Even so, we have continued to gain share at a 
significant rate ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, he said, Carnation's Coffee-mate is creating a bigger market 
and more awareness of the product, which Presto acknowledges is scarcely bad 
news. (Less significant contenders in the market include Borden's Cremora and 
Rich Products Co.'s Farm Rich liquid creamer.) 
</P>
<P>
Carnation seems undaunted by Mocha Mix's established position in the West and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a win-win situation for everybody," said John J. Harris, 
vice president and general manager of the Carnation Products division. "To 
knock off Mocha Mix corporately would not be worthwhile for us." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said Carnation, which has $2.6 billion in annual sales, expects to begin 
shipments of the new liquid Coffee-mate this month, in preparation for "a heavy 
marketing thrust" in January. By the first week of 1990, the product will be in 
more than 90% of U.S. grocery stores, Harris added. 
</P>
<P>
In his office at the stark-white Carnation building on Wilshire Boulevard, 
Harris invites visitors to taste the liquid Coffee-mate straight from a cup. 
"We wanted something that replicated half-and-half," he said. "We've developed 
a product that has a clean taste and masks the flavor of soy." 
</P>
<P>
Getting to that stage took nearly 15 years and millions of dollars. But, given 
the potential for liquid non-dairy creamers, Carnation thought the effort 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it seems to be paying off. Harris said testing in Dallas has resulted 
in a 500% growth of the category, with Carnation's product capturing 65% of the 
market. In Denver, Carnation's entry doubled the market for the category, and 
liquid Coffee-mate has 40% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal long term is to make this into one of the major categories in the 
grocery store," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
If Presto is playing David to Carnation's Goliath, it does not appear to be 
overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We've anticipated somebody coming into the market for a number of years," 
Coffey said. "So we have continued to strengthen our program over the years. 
We're going to keep doing what we think we've done well."

HIRING A CONSULTANT: BEGIN AT THE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are interested in hiring an environmental consultant, it may be wise to 
heed the advice of Joel Moskowitz, author of "Environmental Liability and Real 
Property Transactions," published in May. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz recently characterized the mushrooming industry in real estate 
environmental assessments as "akin to the Gold Rush, in the same way that all 
the miners who were attracted to California were not necessarily the world's 
best miners." 
</P>
<P>
No license or certification is required at present to hang out a shingle as a 
consultant. But many banks keep lists of consultants with whom they are 
familiar. And the California Office of Environmental Affairs has established a 
registry of consultants who meet the following standards: 
</P>
<P>
* Five years' experience in their general field of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
* Two years, within the past four years, doing environmental assessments. 
</P>
<P>
* A bachelor's degree or higher in a physical or biological science, 
engineering or law. 
</P>
<P>
* Three personal references for competence and character. 
</P>
<P>
Most people familiar with the field recommend looking for specialists; if 
you're worried about water, find a consultant with extensive experience 
assessing potential water problems. In this growing industry, experience can 
count more than a diploma on the wall. Sound environmental assessments may be 
made by engineers, attorneys managing subcontractors or consultants with fairly 
wide-ranging backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz counsels buyers to first ask their lending bank for recommended 
consultants, since in many cases the bank will want approval of the consultant 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Moskowitz, an attorney, has set up many environmental assessments 
for clients and recommends going through a lawyer to help keep such studies 
confidential. A client who contracts directly with a consulting firm, he notes, 
may later find a government agency asking to see the results. Work done through 
an attorney is protected by attorney-client privilege, says Moskowitz. 
</P>
<P>
If the client wants to work without a lawyer in the middle, Moskowitz 
recommends going to a larger, established firm. It will likely cost more than a 
smaller consultant, but experience and quality control are less likely to be a 
problem, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens if the consultant misses an environmental hazard? 
</P>
<P>
The potential liability is so high that many consultants draw up contracts that 
limit their liability to a client. In some cases, these contracts even ask 
clients to indemnify the consultant against any possible liability for working 
up their site assessments.

WARNING: DANGER BELOW; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS ARE POPPING UP TO HELP DEVELOPERS SNIFF OUT HAZARDOUS 
WASTE ON SITES BEFORE THEY BUY AND BUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As routinely as house hunters study termite reports, companies shopping for 
commercial real estate now buy and scrutinize environmental assessments of 
target properties. And peering over their shoulders are their bankers -- with 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous waste cleanup can be expensive. The word that no one wants to read is 
remediation, a term that all too often in Southern California appears on orders 
from a local, state or federal agency to rid a property of contamination before 
anything else can be done with it. "Any remediation (that costs) less than a 
couple of million bucks is a small problem," says O. P. Ghuman of 
Woodward-Clyde Consultants in Santa Ana. "A couple of million to 20, I'd put in 
the moderate range. And there's one heck of a lot above 20." 
</P>
<P>
Ghuman is vice president and consulting principal of Woodward-Clyde, which 
along with such other established firms as Dames &amp; Moore, International 
Technology Corp. and McLaren Environmental Engineering, do environmental site 
assessments. Ghuman is considered an old-timer in this still-new business, 
having produced these reports for the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The field is so new that virtually no one knows how big it is in terms of 
sales, or even how many companies are in it. Estimates run from 25 to 250 for 
the number of consultants practicing in Southern California. And the level of 
expertise among the practitioners is equally uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the last unregulated professions," says Joel Moskowitz, partner 
in charge of national environmental practice for Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, 
California's largest law firm. No certification or license is required. "If 
you're tired of being a barber, or a chef," says Moskowitz, "and you want to 
enter a field with unlimited opportunity, become an environmental consultant." 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Environmental Affairs has established a voluntary registry 
of environmental consultants, however, and it lists 1,059 consultants in 
California who have satisfied the office that they have significant expertise 
in real estate assessments. 
</P>
<P>
The misnamed Love Canal and other environmental disasters of the 1970s prompted 
passage in 1980 of the Superfund law, technically known as the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA. This made 
owners responsible for whatever hidden horrors turned up on their land, even if 
the substances were deposited before they owned the property and even if they 
knew nothing of their existence. Beyond federal law, at least a dozen states 
have passed their own statutes. In California, for example, failure to tell a 
buyer in writing of the presence of hazardous materials can bring a $5,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
And in recent years, when these horrors have been so expensive to remove that 
they forced some owners to go belly up, lenders -- either commercial banks or 
mortgage holders in the secondary market -- have been held liable. A series of 
court decisions has made it clear that banks may face the unhappy choice of 
either foreclosing on a property that they will then have to clean up 
themselves or deciding not to foreclose and taking a loss on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Later laws have modified the extent of an owners' liability, especially if they 
show legal due diligence -- often just by having an environmental assessment 
done -- before buying a commercial site. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this has also made environmental assessments even more important. Five 
years ago, only a few thoughtful buyers and lenders might have paid for an 
assessment. Now, it's a rare piece of commercial real estate that is sold to a 
new owner without one. 
</P>
<P>
"Most commercial banks started 12 to 18 months ago developing policies or 
implementing them," says Evan C. Henry, manager of environmental services for 
BankAmerica. While BankAmerica reserves the right to ask for environmental 
assessments even on single-family residential loans, notes Henry, it only 
requires them as a blanket policy on commercial deals of $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy requires that borrowers illustrate to us that their collateral is 
acceptable as real estate security," Henry says. "We do not make any judgments 
or pronouncements as to whether a site is clean or contaminated. We strictly 
get the information provided to us by the borrower." 
</P>
<P>
"And the environmental risk assessment," Henry adds, "though it can be 
significant in some cases, is only one part of determining the 
credit-worthiness of a borrower." 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica and other lenders normally require what's called a phase one 
assessment. This is a report based on a study of various records of the site, 
as well as physical inspection of the premises, but without actually sampling 
the soil, water or air. Although costs vary widely, typical phase one "due 
diligence" reports, as they are often called, run $5,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial photographs dug out of libraries can help fill in a site's history. 
Interviews with present and former workers and, more rarely, neighbors, can be 
useful. And the sharp eye of a consultant with experience in the particular 
industry or business that was once run on the site can often spot telltale 
signs of sloppy handling of hazardous substances. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important element (in a report) is just knowledge Ghuman. "We have 
people who know that if steel was made at this site, what kinds of operations 
would have had to be conducted." 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the records kept by various public agencies over the years. 
Permit agencies keep their own histories. Even a title search can turn up a 
suspicious detail. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, naturally enough, would like to learn of a site's sordid past well 
before taking out construction permits. By then, too much may be committed to 
pull away from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one site that had been used by the federal government," recalls Lindell 
Marsh, of Siemon, Larsen &amp; Marsh, Newport Beach-based attorneys who handle 
commercial real estate transfers. "And it turned out to be used for munitions 
disposal, though no one knows exactly. But what was suspected was that at the 
end of the war, they just dumped a lot of these old weapons in a hole, then 
covered them over with municipal waste. And when the developer tried to put up 
condominiums, it took $3.5 million to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a site's general location is enough to cause consultants to give the 
land an especially careful look. 
</P>
<P>
Alistaire B. Callender, a senior project scientist at Woodward-Clyde, cites 
Carson as a place requiring special care, because it is "an area where there's 
a lot of industrial, a lot of oil field activity. Santa Fe Springs is, too, as 
opposed to south Orange County, where it was primarily agricultural." 
</P>
<P>
Phase two studies, which are usually undertaken only when something in a phase 
one review smells (sometimes literally), involve laboratory work on soil, water 
and (rarely) air samples. They can easily cost 10 times the price of a phase 
one report. 
</P>
<P>
Often, potential buyers back out of a deal when even a potentially suspicious 
former use pops up in a phase one report, notes Ghuman of Woodward-Clyde. The 
horror stories of land that takes more to clean up than it's worth afterward 
are too numerous to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Noble, vice president of EnviroQuest Information Services and financial 
editor of Environmental Business Journal, recalls a small chunk of former 
agricultural land that cost $40,000 to buy, then an additional $100,000 to 
clean up when hazardous materials were found. 
</P>
<P>
"There are properties like that all around L.A.," says Noble, "and there they 
sit, because no one wants to accept the liability."

ART: A STAR-STUDDED LIST OF SELLERS JOCKEY FOR POSITION IN THE OVERHEATED N.Y. 
AUCTION WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christie's and Sotheby's are gearing up for the height of New York's fall 
auction season. They have laid in plentiful supplies of multimillion-dollar 
paintings, mailed catalogues far and wide, sent star artworks on the road and 
lined up prospective buyers. Now comes the public part: a round of auctions, on 
Tuesday through Nov. 15, that is expected to ring up more than $500 million in 
sales of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art. 
</P>
<P>
Art isn't the only thing for sale, however. Prestigious provenance is also on 
the block, as we see from the star-studded list of sellers. Collectors who are 
concerned about who has owned the art they buy should feel secure this season. 
Even those who want or need no validation of their own judgment are likely to 
be impressed by the consignors: 
</P>
<P>
* Lorinda de Roulet, sister of John Whitney Payson -- who sold Vincent van 
Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million two years ago -- will sell Pablo Picasso's 
"Au Lapin Agile" at Sotheby's on Nov. 15. De Roulet and Payson inherited the 
paintings from their mother, Joan Whitney Payson, a noted collector, 
philanthropist and owner of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors abound that "Au Lapin Agile" may replace "Irises" as the world's most 
expensive painting. Failing that, the Rose Period cabaret scene featuring 
Picasso as a harlequin may still break the artist's record of $47.85 million 
set in May for "Yo Picasso." Sotheby's has announced no firm estimate for "Au 
Lapin Agile," but a press release states that the firm anticipates "the same 
level of interest among collectors" as "Yo Picasso." 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Mellon, a major benefactor of the National Gallery of Art and son of 
museum founder Andrew W. Mellon, is pruning his personal collection to the tune 
of $100 million. Christie's New York on Nov. 14 will offer about $85 million to 
$90 million worth of that cache -- in the form of 15 Impressionist and modern 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them are Edouard Manet's painting "Rue Mosnier, Paris, Decorated 
With Flags on June 30, 1878," valued at more than $30 million, and "The Tree, 
Arles," a vivid 1888 landscape by Van Gogh, expected to bring at least $25 
million. Picasso's "Death of a Harlequin," a Rose Period painting that Mellon 
bought from W. Somerset Maugham's collection, is expected to sell for more than 
$20 million. Three of Edgar Degas' wax sculptures of ballet dancers, valued at 
$1.5 million to $2 million apiece, are also in the Mellon sale. 
</P>
<P>
* Billy Wilder, a legendary film maker and highly regarded art collector, will 
sell 94 modern and contemporary works at Christie's on Nov. 13. Expected to 
total as much as $30 million, the Wilder collection is among the liveliest 
collections to come up for sale in many years. Exercising a purely personal 
taste that favors literary complexities and emotional punch, Wilder purchased 
exquisitely raunchy nudes by Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, poetic boxes 
and collages by Joseph Cornell and delightful whimsies by Joan Miro. In the 
Wilder roster of works by 47 artists, Picasso's classical 1921 pastel drawing, 
"Tete de Femme," is expected to bring the sale's top price of $5 million to $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* The late Edgar Kaufmann Jr., a Frank Lloyd Wright scholar and heir to a 
Pittsburgh department store fortune, is known for persuading his father to 
commission Wright's masterpiece, a house called "Fallingwater," but he was also 
a distinguished collector of art. Sotheby's Nov. 15 sale of 21 Impressionist 
and modern works from his collection is expected to total up to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
There's a Monet waterlily painting, valued at $7 million to $9 million, an 
early Mondrian, called "Facade in Tan and Grey" ($6 million to $8 million) and 
a sprightly Miro, "l'Oiseau au Plumage Deploye Vole Vers l'Arbre Argente "($4 
million to $5 million). Another painting from the Kaufmann collection, Willem 
de Kooning's 1955 "Interchange" ($4 million to $6 million) is among top 
offerings in Sotheby's contemporary sale on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
* The late Robert B. Mayer, a Chicago clothing retailer, founding member of the 
Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art and supporter of the Art Institute of 
Chicago, amassed one of the finest private art collections in the country. 
Twenty contemporary pieces from the Mayer collection, for sale at Christie's on 
Tuesday, include Roy Lichtenstein's comic-strip style "Torpedo . . . Los!," 
expected to bring $3 million to $4 million, and Jasper Johns' small gray 
painting of numbers, "O Through 9," valued at $2.5 million to $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
How does such distinguished ownership figure into the auction houses' 
estimates? Not at all, officials from Christie's and Sotheby's insist. If only 
to protect themselves from being overly optimistic in an overheated market, 
they establish estimates that they say reflect market value, based on sales of 
similar works. 
</P>
<P>
But the two houses compete vigorously for big-name collections and promote them 
to the hilt. The selling of collections includes selling the collectors as 
people of prescience and taste. 
</P>
<P>
Prestigious "single-owner" sales -- auctions that include a number of works 
from a single collection -- are fancy dress occasions with admission by ticket 
and reserved seats for favored clients. 
</P>
<P>
These sales have color-illustrated catalogues, often containing essays about 
the collectors, historical notes and photographs of how the artworks were 
installed in the collectors' homes. Really big sales get hard-cover catalogues. 
Really, really big sales of single paintings -- such as "Irises" and "Au Lapin 
Agile" -- get their own hard-cover books. 
</P>
<P>
Artworks in "single-owner" sales are also sent on carefully plotted 
international tours that include private openings and public viewings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the strategy works. Highly publicized "single-owner" sales often 
surpass, even double, their estimates. That success -- coupled with the fear 
that the bubble will burst -- persuades more collectors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
With art pouring out of closets, new collectors emerging in ever larger numbers 
and European buying reportedly on the rise, this year promises to bring more of 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest note of skepticism about the perpetually escalating art market 
has been voiced over what some observers call artificial prices, pumped up by 
Sotheby's practice of loaning money to their clients for the purchase of art 
from Sotheby's sales. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous case is that of Australian businessman Alan Bond who reportedly 
borrowed about $27 million from Sotheby's to buy "Irises" in 1987 and 
subsequently suffered financial setbacks. Although he has made regular payments 
-- after renegotiating the loan -- the painting is safely locked in a Sotheby's 
vault, according to the auction house. To help pay off his loan, Bond has 
consigned "La Promenade," an Impressionist painting by Edouard Manet valued at 
$10 million to $14 million, to Sotheby's Nov. 15 sale -- the same auction that 
features "Au Lapin Agile."

A risky new National Endowment for the Arts controversy -- emanating from an 
art show focusing on the AIDS epidemic and containing sexually explicit gay 
photographs -- has broken out here even as the agency struggles to recover from 
a bruising political fight. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the NEA nor the New York City artist organization sponsoring the show, 
scheduled to open Nov. 16, would discuss the dispute in detail. But The Times 
learned national endowment attorneys have contacted a lawyer representing the 
gallery -- apparently to try to persuade the organization to voluntarily return 
$10,000 in endowment funding for it. 
</P>
<P>
NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer has also met privately with Susan Wyatt, 
director of Artists Space, the Manhattan gallery and arts activist 
organization, to urge that the endowment's name be removed from publicity 
materials about the show and that the show's catalogue include a disclaimer 
distancing the work from the NEA. Under existing federal law, the endowment 
cannot order the return of grant money, but it can disassociate itself from a 
piece of work or exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The show has a total budget of about $30,000. Artists Space, one of the 
nation's best known artist-run gallery and support organizations, has received 
$199,000 in NEA grants in the last three years and is highly reputed in the 
NEA's museum and visual arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists Space show is titled "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." It 
involves the work of 23 different artists and was organized by Nan Goldin, a 
prominent New York City artist and photographer. The show, which is scheduled 
to remain on view until Jan. 6, was planned to coincide with a daylong Dec. 1 
national program called "Visual AIDS," in which museums and arts groups around 
the country will sponsor events oriented toward the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Frohnmayer and Wyatt continued through the weekend, without 
final resolution. Wyatt scheduled an emergency meeting of the board of Artists 
Space for this week, but she said categorically that the gallery would not 
cancel or alter the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The situation underscored widespread fears among arts observers that the 
political fight over control of content of federally funded artworks could lead 
to a new era of hypersensitivity and fear that could influence subject matter 
of work funded by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the dispute also appeared to represent the introduction of a new tactic by 
artists determined to resist the imposition of censorship standards. Wyatt said 
that, while she regretted having to involve the NEA in a fresh dispute, she 
felt it was important for artists and arts groups to actively resist any 
chilling of freedom of expression in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
In the original application for the grant, submitted in November, 1988, Artists 
Space described the show as intended to treat the AIDS crisis and "focus on 
three areas: sexuality, recovery from drug use (and) death." The application 
noted that "the issue of sexuality deals with the sublimation of sexuality 
through art or art as safe sex." 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary attempt to either distance the endowment from the content of 
the show -- which is said to include homoerotic sexually explicit pictures and 
text materials that criticize a variety of public officials, specifically 
including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) -- has developed as Frohnmayer has 
struggled to contain political damage to the arts agency and resume normal 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In comments during a meeting of the National Council on the Arts, the NEA's 
advisory body, Frohnmayer confirmed that a delicate negotiation was under way 
in regard to the content of "Witnesses," precipitated by intense fears within 
the endowment that the episode could rekindle the political firestorm that 
enveloped the NEA over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to comment on that. We are really communicating actively," 
Frohnmayer said of the situation. "This is a very difficult situation. It has 
the potential of being as politically sensitive as some of the other grants 
have been. We are trying to manage it." 
</P>
<P>
The other sensitive grants to which Frohnmayer referred were the basis of the 
political tumult that arose starting last April. Helms and other conservatives 
in Congress objected to the subject matter content of shows involving the work 
of two photographers, including sadomasochistic and homoerotic images of the 
late Robert Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS last March. The Robert Mapplethorpe 
Foundation, an AIDS organization endowed by proceeds from Mapplethorpe's 
estate, is underwriting publication of the catalogue for "Witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
The political dispute resulted in restrictions in the 1990 NEA funding bill 
that prohibit grants to support work that is obscene unless the work meets high 
standards of artistic excellence. The grant for the New York City show, 
however, involves money from the NEA's 1989 budget that was disbursed in July 
and is not subject to the content restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Wyatt brought the subject matter content of the "Witnesses" 
show to the attention first of officials of the NEA's museum division, which 
funded the show, and then of Frohnmayer personally. As a result of the 
notification by Wyatt, Frohnmayer sent Andrew Oliver Jr., acting director of 
the NEA's museum program, to New York to personally inspect work to be included 
in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt's decision to warn Frohnmayer of a potentially difficult grant -- of 
which he might not have otherwise become personally aware until the New York 
show opened -- was part of what she said was a deliberate strategy to keep the 
NEA chairman from being blind-sided by developments of which he had no 
knowledge. However, Wyatt also said her tactics were intended to provoke a 
confrontation with the principle of federal control of arts subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
She said she initially developed the strategy at a meeting in Minneapolis three 
weeks ago of the National Assn. of Artist Organizations. She advocated that 
every museum and arts group take deliberate action to take issue with the 
proposition that federally-imposed standards of any kind should dictate the 
content of art. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the Metropolitan Museum of Art (in New York City) and the Museum of 
Modern Art (involved,)" Wyatt said. "This is why I have done this." Wyatt and 
Charlotte Murphy, director of the National Assn. of Artist Organizations, met 
privately during the national council meeting with Wendy Luers, an artist and 
arts patron who is a member of the national advisory body. Luers is married to 
William Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Frohnmayer and other arts endowment officials conceded 
that they were having difficulty drawing up written standards to put the 1990 
content restrictions officially into place. In the draft of a letter intended 
to be sent to all NEA grant recipients, Frohnmayer urged grant recipients to 
cooperate with the endowment and to avoid actions that the arts agency's 
opponents could construe as deliberately provocative. 
</P>
<P>
"You may or may not like or agree with the new law," the letter draft said. 
"But it is still the law." The draft was released at the national council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Frohnmayer said endowment officials had concluded of the 
pitfalls of implementing the content-control standards that "it's a whole lot 
harder in the specific to make these decisions than it is in the abstract." 
</P>
<P>
"When you get the first one (arts project likely to be politically troublesome) 
coming down the pike," he said, "it really is crunch time. It's terribly, 
terribly tough. I don't think any of us were satisfied that the task is in hand 
or that it's going to be easy."

SANTA ANA MAN KILLED, WIFE HURT AS FLEEING TEEN-AGER RAMS CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was killed and his wife critically injured early today when a 
15-year-old wrong-way driver crashed into the couple's car as the teen-ager 
tried to elude pursuing police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who was not identified because of age, was traveling north in 
the southbound lanes of Fairview Street at an estimated 80 m.p.h. in a stolen, 
four-wheel-drive pickup truck, said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
He smashed broadside into the couple's car, which was heading west on 1st 
Street. The truck struck with such force that both the man and women were 
thrown from their car. Neither was identified by police pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said the incident began about 3:45 a.m. when a police officer noticed 
the pickup truck being driven erratically while headed west on McFadden Avenue, 
near Raitt Street. When the young driver apparently saw the officer behind him, 
he abruptly turned into a shopping center and then headed north on Fairview 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
To further evade the officer, the youth turned into the oncoming southbound 
traffic lanes and speeded up. The officer, Helton said, remained in the 
northbound lanes as the pickup ran a red light at 1st Street and struck the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old driver of the car was pronounced dead at United Western Medical 
Center about two hours after the crash. The 33-year-old woman was in critical 
condition at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana youth received only a minor cut on his head in the crash. He was 
taken to Juvenile Hall where he was booked on suspicion of murder, grand theft 
auto, possession of stolen property and evading a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup had been stolen from Huntington Beach recently, he said.

800 S&amp;LS LIKELY TO FLUNK TOUGH NEW RULES, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
WILL NEED $20 BILLION TO STAY OPEN

<P>
Federal officials said today that 800 savings and loan associations are likely 
to fail tough new capital standards being imposed next month and will have to 
raise as much as $20 billion to keep operating. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, required by the S&amp;L bailout law, call for all thrifts to 
hold capital equal to 3% of their assets. Institutions that fall short will 
face strict government supervision while they are trying to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
"These new standards will require savings institutions to become stronger and 
will thereby reduce the exposure of the federal deposit insurance fund to 
losses," M. Danny Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said of 
the standards, designed to reduce further failures of savings and loan 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The office, created by the savings and loan bailout law passed by Congress last 
summer, estimated that 800 thrift institutions with assets totaling $600 
billion would not be able to meet the capital requirements immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Those failing to comply will have immediate growth restrictions imposed on them 
by the office and will be required to develop capital restoration plans 
detailing the steps they will take to meet the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made as James Barth, the office's chief economist, told an 
S&amp;L industry group in Chicago that thrift institutions lost at least $2.5 
billion in the July-September quarter, probably the best performance in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the new standards, many thrifts have been selling assets and 
reducing their size recently, and the thrift office said many of them will be 
able to meet the new requirements by the time they take effect on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
A key provision in the reform bill requires S&amp;L owners to risk more of 
their own capital as a buffer between losses and government deposit insurance 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The standards require S&amp;Ls to keep in reserve at least 1.5% tangible 
capital and 3% core capital and meet a risk-based capital requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Tangible capital consists of common stock plus retained earnings but excludes 
most intangible assets, such as good will. 
</P>
<P>
Core capital consists of tangible capital plus good will. Good will is an 
accounting term referring to the amount above actual cash value paid by an 
investor for a troubled thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Risk-based capital consists of 8% of the value of risk-weighted assets when the 
new rule is fully phased in. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum capital for the credit risk component -- the risk of a loan not 
being repaid -- is calculated by multiplying the value of each asset (including 
off-balance-sheet commitments) by one of five risk factors and holding 8% of 
the result as the minimum required capital," the office said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the five risk categories range from 0% for cash to 200% for certain 
delinquent loans and repossessed property. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it said, a typical home mortgage has a risk factor of 50%. Thus, 
the risk capital required capital on a $100,000 home mortgage loan would be 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The risk-based capital requirement was described as the "most important" of the 
three standards that will make S&amp;L standards "no less stringent" than those 
imposed on the commercial banking industry.

<P>
A Van Nuys teen-ager was in extremely critical condition today after being shot 
during what investigators believe was a gang-related dispute in his back yard, 
Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
William Segovia, 16, was being treated for a chest wound at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Jim Vojtecky said Segovia was found in his back yard in the 13900 
block of Roscoe Boulevard about 9:50 p.m. Sunday. The detective said Segovia, a 
known gang member, was believed to have been shot during a dispute with other 
gang members, but the exact motivation was not known. 
</P>
<P>
There were no suspects in the shooting. Police were attempting to determine if 
the shooting was related to a rash of gang drive-by shootings last week at 
schools and parks in the mid-San Fernando Valley, but so far there was no known 
connection, Vojtecky said.

The satirical magazine Private Eye, threatened with closure by a massive libel 
suit by the estranged wife of one of Britain's most notorious mass killers, won 
a reprieve today when the case was settled. 
</P>
<P>
Private Eye appealed successfully last month against the size of the $930,000 
damages awarded by a jury to Sonia Sutcliffe in May. It was the largest libel 
award ever made in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Today Private Eye told the Court of Appeal that it had agreed to pay one-tenth 
of the award and legal costs to Sutcliffe, wife of the murderer nicknamed "The 
Yorkshire Ripper." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which has made its reputation by lampooning politicians, royalty 
and public figures for almost 30 years, was ordered by the High Court to pay an 
additional $155,000 in settlement of a second libel suit brought by Sutcliffe.

PURPORTED DAUGHTER LOSES BID FOR HANK WILLIAMS' ROYALTIES

A woman who says she is Hank Williams Sr.'s illegitimate daughter lost a 
Supreme Court bid today for a share of the late country music legend's 
copyright royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Cathy Yvonne Stone waited 
too long to sue over the royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Stone, 36, was born in Alabama five days after Williams died Jan. 1, 
1953, at age 29. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Bobbie Jett, and Williams had signed an agreement a few months 
earlier in which he acknowledged that he might be the father of the child. 
</P>
<P>
The girl first was adopted by Lillian Stone, Williams' mother. After Lillian 
Stone died, the child was adopted by George and Mary Deupree. The Deuprees in 
1967 refused to be included in court proceedings to determine whether Williams 
had fathered any children other than Hank Williams Jr., now a country music 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Deupree first told her adopted daughter in 1973 that the elder Williams 
may have been her natural father. But Cathy Stone did not take any immediate 
legal action to establish her real parentage. She waited until 1985, soon after 
marrying attorney Keith Adkinson.

Jerome Robbins, regarded as one of the century's finest choreographers, said he 
will resign as co-director of the New York City Ballet on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, 71, plans to continue writing his memoirs and to develop an 
autobiographical theater piece. The ballet company announced his resignation 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important at my age to do other things," he said. "I'm resigning from the 
New York City Ballet; I'm not retiring from the field." 
</P>
<P>
Though he is stepping down as co-director, Robbins is due soon to begin 
rehearsals at the City Ballet for a retrospective of his ballets since 1944. 
The Robbins festival is scheduled to be presented next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer, who has worked with the City Ballet since 1949, has spent 
most of the past year working on "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," a medley of 
excerpts from musicals he choreographed or directed. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Martins, the City Ballet's other co-director, will be solely responsible 
for the company's artistic policy after Robbins' resignation becomes effective.

Most Japanese believe that their country should open its doors to unskilled 
foreign workers, but the government says tough entry restrictions on such 
workers will continue. 
</P>
<P>
A poll of 3,000 Japanese nationwide, conducted by the Asahi Shimbun daily 
newspaper and published today, showed that 56% believe that Japan should admit 
foreign workers, with 33% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
A Labor Ministry official said Japan will "absolutely not" review its stance on 
admitting unskilled foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do they take job opportunities away from Japanese, they also make it 
difficult for Japanese to improve their working conditions, because foreign 
workers are willing to take low wages and not demand insurance and other 
benefits," the official said.

Stock prices dropped sharply today amid persistent concern over the outlook for 
interest rates and corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 47.34 points to 2,582.17. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 349 up, 1,185 down and 430 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 135.48 million shares, against 131.50 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 2.52 to 184.76. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's view of prospects for corporate earnings has worsened steadily 
over the past few weeks as reports for the third quarter of the year came in 
below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the first few indications for the fourth quarter have also 
been negative. 
</P>
<P>
That concern had been at least partly counterbalanced by hopes that the Federal 
Reserve might soon relax its credit policy further, in order to cushion the 
impact of slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But last Friday's stronger-than-expected employment figures for October 
dampened that speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were lower in slow trading early today amid speculation that the 
Federal Reserve will not relax its credit policy in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond declined 7/16 point, or $4.37 for 
every $1,000 in face value, by around midday. Its yield, which rises when 
prices fall, climbed to 7.97% from 7.93% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts described the decline as a continuation of Friday's retreat in bond 
prices, which was triggered by a government report showing surprisingly strong 
job growth in October. 
</P>
<P>
Traders believe that the report dims chances for an easing soon in the Fed's 
credit policy, which means interest rates are not likely to fall significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing some continued reaction from Friday's data," said Kevin Flanagan, 
a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The market is reacting a 
little bit unfavorably now." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the market's nervousness was today's announcement by the Treasury 
that it is postponing its weekly auction of three- and six-month bills because 
Congress has not raised the debt ceiling. The Treasury bill sales normally are 
held every Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues slipped 3/32 point to 3/16 point, intermediate maturities 
were down 3/16 point to 9/32 point and 20-year issues lost 7/16 point, 
according to figures provided by the Telerate Inc. financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
fell 3.11 to 1,185.97. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 3/4%, unchanged from late Friday.

<P>
The former head of Los Angeles-based Transit Casualty Co., a high-risk insurer 
that left up to $4 billion in unpaid claims when it crumbled in 1985, has 
pleaded innocent to a charge of filing a false financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
George Pettengill Bowie, 64, Transit's former chairman and chief executive 
officer, entered the plea Thursday in Circuit Court after his indictment by a 
Cole County grand jury, county prosecutor Richard Callahan said today. 
</P>
<P>
The charge stems from the company's 1984 financial statement, which indicated a 
$21.9-million surplus when in fact Transit's records were "incomplete, 
inaccurate, inauditable and in such a state that it was impossible to construct 
an accurate financial statement," the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Filing a false annual statement is a felony punishable by up to five years in 
prison. No trial date has been set for Bowie, who is free on a $250,000 
signature bond.

The Treasury Department postponed its scheduled weekly auction of three-month 
and six-month bills today because of Congress' failure to raise the debt limit. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain whether the Treasury would be able to go ahead with its 
planned quarterly refunding later this week. 
</P>
<P>
It tentatively had scheduled auctions of $10 billion in three-year notes on 
Tuesday, $10 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year 
bonds on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The government's borrowing authority dropped from $2.87 trillion to $2.80 
trillion last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the current 
fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been blocked by a squabble over whether 
to cut the capital gains tax.

AVERAGE SOVIET CITIZEN EARNS $8,850, CIA SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The CIA says the average Soviet citizen earned the equivalent of $8,850 last 
year, less than half the average American's earnings of $19,970. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA's "Handbook of Economic Statistics 1989" shows that the U.S. figure was 
higher than that of other major non-communist countries, with the average 
Japanese shown as earning $14,340 and the average West German $14,260. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings of the average American grew by 2.9% in 1988; the average Soviet 
citizen had an increase of only 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The handbook's 1988 edition did not include a figure for the Soviet Union, 
although other statistics indicate that the average citizen's earnings there 
were $8,363 in 1987, compared to $18,200 for the average American. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA makes these comparisons on a "purchasing power" basis. That means it 
does not translate foreign earnings into dollars at prevailing exchange rates 
but at theoretical rates that would equalize the cost of a basket of goods and 
services in the two countries being compared. The document did not say what 
those theoretical rates were. 
</P>
<P>
A few other comparisons were given for 1988: Life expectancy was 69 years in 
the Soviet Union, 75 years in the United States and 78 years in Japan. The 
average American used energy equal to burning 56 barrels of oil, and the 
average Soviet consumed only 35 barrels worth. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few more cars than one for every two Americans -- 572 per thousand 
-- and only one for every 24 Soviets -- 42 per thousand, according to the CIA. 
The Soviet figure came from 1986 and may have grown by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet international trade was closer to balance than America's: The United 
States imported $128 billion worth of goods more than it exported, and the 
Soviets had a surplus equal to $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Total production of goods and services in the Soviet Union was valued at $2.5 
trillion, compared to $4.9 trillion in the United States. The Soviet population 
was larger at mid-year, 296.4 million compared to 246 million for the United 
States. Both populations were growing at the same rate: 0.9% a year.

BECKER TURNS MISFORTUNES INTO VICTORIES AS HE SHOOTS FOR NO. 1

<P>
Boris Becker says it's difficult to get to the top, but that it's even harder 
to get back there. 
</P>
<P>
"People see me playing tennis and nobody knows the real cost of winning," 
Becker said. "Sometimes it is necessary to grow and learn as a human being. 
That's what I did in the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, playing with increased confidence after struggling over the past two 
years, looks as if he is ready to stake his claim as the best tennis player in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old West German beat Stefan Edberg and John McEnroe, the No. 3 and 
No. 4 ranked players in the world, in less than 24 hours to win the Paris Open, 
which attracted 17 of the top 20 players in the world. Becker downed Edberg 
6-4, 6-3, 6-3 after stopping McEnroe in Saturday's semifinals 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Against a slightly off-form Edberg on Sunday, Becker raced through the final in 
two hours for his fifth tournament title of the year and 24th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion this year, has a good claim on the 
No. 1 ranking for the year although he still trails Ivan Lendl in the computer 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had won two Wimbledons and advanced to the No. 2 ranking in the 
world by the time he was 18, Becker was expected to move into the top spot 
three years ago, especially when his victory at the 1986 Paris Open capped a 
three-week, three-tournament, three-continent victory march. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing great tennis in 1985 and 1986, but I didn't go through any 
difficult moments," Becker said. "In order to be the best, you have to go 
through those moments. That's what I did in '87 and the beginning of '88." 
</P>
<P>
Becker's troubles started in the beginning of 1987 when he broke with former 
coach Gunther Bosch at the Australian Open -- where he lost to Wally Masur in 
the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
Becker righted himself a bit in 1988, making the Wimbledon final but losing to 
Edberg. Foot injuries plagued him all year long. 
</P>
<P>
"All that helped me this year. That is the reason I am playing so well," Becker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's fortunes turned in last year's Masters when he beat Lendl in five 
sets, winning the deciding point on a let cord in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he won Wimbledon for the third time, beating Edberg, and took the 
U.S. Open by beating Lendl in the final.

Miami Dolphins defensive end Eric Kumerow and his sister were charged with two 
felony counts each of assaulting a police officer in a melee outside a sports 
bar, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Kumerow, sister Cheryl and a friend were arrested Sunday night after police 
were called because of a fight inside Koz's bar, said police. The Kumerows, 
also charged with trespassing, were released Sunday night after posting bond. 
Conviction on the felony charge of assaulting a police officer would carry a 
possible maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Police who found the group outside the bar "described them all as being drunk," 
said Ft. Lauderdale Police spokesman Ott Cefkin. The 6-foot-7, 268-pound 
Kumerow punched one officer twice, Cefkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kumerows reportedly were asked to leave Koz's after a fight and were in the 
parking lot at about 10:40 p.m. when police arrived and found them "highly 
agitated," Cefkin said. The bar's namesake is former Dolphins' safety Mike 
Kozlowski. 
</P>
<P>
The friend, Robert Sean Skelton, 24, of Chicago, had been in the fight inside 
and began kicking one of the police officers, Cefkin said.

Cleveland Browns running back Kevin Mack was granted probation today, 
permitting his release after serving one month of a six-month prison term for 
using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Richard J. McMonagle of Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court granted Mack 
two-year probation, effective immediately, along with several requirements, 
including regular urine testing for drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something I want you to know. You have one dirty urine, and I'll send 
you back to prison," McMonagle said. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, wearing orange overalls and running shoes, told the judge: "Your Honor, I 
feel I learned a valuable lesson from the mistake I made -- being involved with 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was in the institution I've just been around people that I've never 
seen before, and never really confronted before. It really scared me. 
</P>
<P>
"And I just feel that, given another chance, I can turn my life around with the 
help of God and the friends I have and the program I'm trying to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Mack, 27, was arrested June 28 after police investigating drug activity checked 
a car Mack had been driving.

World soccer's governing body, which has suspended Chilean goalkeeper Roberto 
Rojas for life, accused him today of attempting the sport's biggest swindle and 
called Chile's conduct "criminal." 
</P>
<P>
The International Soccer Federation sanctioned Rojas last month after he 
retracted claims that he was hurt by a signal flare thrown from the stands 
during a Sept. 3 World Cup qualifier at Brazil. Chile abandoned the match, 
saying its safety was endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's general secretary, Joseph Blatter, said other Chileans seem 
likely to have colluded with Rojas in staging "the biggest attempt at swindle 
in the history of (the federation)," making him "perpetrator and victim at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of conspiracy spells danger for Chile because the federation's 
executive committee could decide on further punishment in considering the case 
next month. Possible measures include banning Chile from international 
tournaments for a time.

Gov. George Deukmejian today signed a 12-bill earthquake relief package, 
including a temporary sales tax hike to raise $800 million.

<P>
"We're going to do whatever is necessary to restore the lives and the homes of 
the people who were victims of this quake," Deukmejian said as he began signing 
the bills.

As Mayor Art Agnos and a dozen legislators looked on, Deukmejian signed the 
relief package at 11:45 a.m. after riding a ferry boat across the San Francisco 
Bay from Oakland.

"I congratulate the Legislature on its quick action on the earthquake relief 
package to assist the earthquake victims in rebuilding their lives, businesses 
and communities," Deukmejian said.

State and federal aid, the Republican governor said, "should provide the 
necessary resources in order to restore some semblance of normalcy in the Bay 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Some legislators of both parties criticized the plan, which raises the sales 
tax to as much as 7 cents on the dollar, depending on local rates. Deukmejian 
also plans to tap the state reserve for $200 million.
