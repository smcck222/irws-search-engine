HIS 43 YEARS OF GOOD CHEER EARN A SALUTE; 
</P>
<P>
AMOS MANUEL HAS MADE BOTH LIFE AND SHOES LOOK BRIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's a small thing, really, an old piece of metal anchored deep in the 8th 
Avenue curb, a sturdy ring built to tie a horse to, though no one has done that 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
A rusty remnant of another day, it sits there like a worn penny amid the parked 
motorcycles, passing cars and passers-by, overlooked and forgotten by almost 
everyone except Amos Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, when he was a boy, athletic and strong, Manuel would ride a 
friend's horse down the railroad right of way from National City to downtown 
San Diego, where he would watch a movie in one of the many theaters then 
thriving. And he would tie the horse to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is bent at the back from arthritis and walks with the aid of two 
canes. But he is still there, 40 feet across the street, proprietor of Amos' 
Shoeshine, as near as anyone can tell the oldest shoeshine emporium in town. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, when he first leased the small, open-air, brick-walled room, about 
the width and length of a bus bench, Amos has dispensed a special brand of 
friendliness, ribald humor and human warmth right along with the polish. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of those 43 years, Amos has earned a cadre of disparate admirers, 
from barrio kids and bankers to secretaries and judges. He has endeared himself 
not with wealth or position but by being who he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best souls I've known," says Alice Zukor, owner of Broadway 
Florists, a few doors down from Amos'. Zukor met Amos more than 40 years ago by 
way of her late husband, Allan, who was good buddies with him. "He's just a 
genuinely kind man." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no more eloquent testimony exists for that than the bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday without fail since 1944, Amos has bought his wife, Ellen -- a 
former dancer at the old Creole Palace -- a bouquet from the Zukors. If he was 
sick, Amos sent his only child, Dennis, down to the flower shop, and, if his 
son couldn't go, then he would ask someone else. It's a streak of such love and 
devotion that it touches even the most hard-nosed of his customers. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason this shoeshine man is revered by his friends. Several years 
ago, he underwent a double hernia operation, paid for in full by his regular 
customers. And next Tuesday a group of them will honor Amos at a special 
luncheon at the U.S. Grant Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was time to pay some tribute to this downtown institution," said 
Superior Court Judge Ross Tharp, an Amos customer for more than 20 years who is 
helping organize the fete. "He's just a charming guy who makes you feel glad. 
You have a smile when you 
</P>
<P>
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Amos' family lived in San Diego when his pregnant mother went to Oklahoma on an 
emergency trip to see her injured sister. As fate would have it, she delivered 
Amos there, an accident recorded on a birth certificate but which in 
practicality has no bearing on his claim that he was both born and raised in 
San Diego. He became one of 14 brothers and sisters, and the only one still 
alive. While he had several jobs as a youngster, he and a brother worked their 
way through San Diego High School shining shoes, both from a box they carried 
around town and from a stand at 7th and B Streets, today the site of the 
Imperial Bank high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
"This used to be a strong Navy town then and there were lots of shoes to 
shine," Amos said recently. "We used to charge the sailors 10 cents coming and 
5 cents going out." 
</P>
<P>
A good athlete who played football, basketball and baseball in high school, 
Amos worked as a bellhop, for the gas company and for a contractor. Then the 
United States entered World War II. He and several of his brothers marched down 
and signed up, and for the next 3 1/2 years he worked as a Navy cook for an 
aviation squadron, stationed aboard aircraft carriers, including the ill-fated 
escort carrier Liscombe Bay. 
</P>
<P>
It's an episode Amos would rather forget, but military records show a Japanese 
submarine hit Liscombe Bay with a torpedo at 5:10 a.m. on Nov. 24, 1943, during 
a fierce four-day battle. Twenty minutes later it sank, about 20 miles 
southeast of Makin Island. The ship carried 644 men, 272 of whom survived. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to San Diego, Amos went back to the shoeshine business, and a 
friend scouted out a good location for him -- on the east of the 8th Avenue 
between C Street and Broadway -- in what was then nothing but a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it was a bustling time for downtown, before freeways, suburban 
sprawl, shopping malls and jogging shoes, Amos for a time worked a second job, 
usually as a night janitor. 
</P>
<P>
But he always came back to the shoeshine stand. Little bigger than a walk-in 
closet, its walls are cluttered with yellowed newspaper clippings and 
photographs, some showing Amos as a much younger man standing and smiling with 
friends, others capturing his customers' happy moments holding a big fish or 
embracing at a party. A small electric heater wards off the chill. A few 
tarnished plaques hang on the wall, the words lost to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched among the knickknacks and mementos are Amos' collection of pin-up 
girls, not your 1940s variety heavy on teasing the imagination but the more 
current crop of less-is-more '80s women. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of a shine, Amos is likely to treat his customer to a platter 
of jokes and stories just short of Jay Leno-quality. Zsa Zsa is a current 
favorite topic. "Did you hear Zsa Zsa has a new perfume out?" Amos asks. "Yeah, 
you slap it on." If that one's too tame, you'll have to go get a shine 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy has a cheerful greeting for everyone, and the women love him," said 
the barber next door to Amos, Gabe Ornelas. "The women will walk by his stand, 
and Amos will say to them, 'Do me a favor.' And they'll look and say, 'What?' 
and then he'll smile and tell them, 'Stay pretty.' They love it." 
</P>
<P>
Shining shoes is a hard business, and for Amos his schedule of six-day weeks 
from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night would be tough enough for a younger 
man, let alone for someone older than 70, many of whose contemporaries are 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Amos was hit by a car two years ago while he was crossing 8th Avenue at G 
Street. They never caught the driver, but Amos has had to live with a bad leg 
since. "That really messed me up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He has a bad back, bad knees and a bad hip. He is so badly stooped that, when 
he shines shoes, he glances up from the waist to return a greeting, his eyes 
moving to make contact but his body bound by its pain. The $3 he collects for 
each shine is a must: He has his own doctors' bills, and his wife is ill too. 
</P>
<P>
"That don't help it none," Amos says, explaining what shining shoes does to his 
back. "It's tough work. Do it eight hours a day and see how tough it is. It 
gets to your shoulders and arms, too. You're on your feet a lot." He says it 
matter-of-factly, without rancor, simply responding to a question. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, this is not a bitter man. He is proud. He speaks reverentially 
of his son, who works for the opera. He speaks of his customers, especially the 
old timers, with grace. 
</P>
<P>
He places honesty on a pedestal. It has been a life with few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to treat everyone the same. There was a time when I had lines of 
customers, and I started giving them two coats instead of three, because I 
wanted to get to them all. Well, I was ruining my business doing that," he 
said. "Well, now I give three coats to everyone, and I don't count them 
(customers) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make sure you enjoy your work . . . and don't cut no corners 
because they catch up with you." 
</P>

DISTRICT-ONLY RACES RADICALLY CUT INCUMBENTS' SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: GRASS-ROOTS CAMPAIGNING SUPPLANTS COSTLY, GLITZY MEDIA DRIVES AS KEY 
TO WINNING CITY COUNCIL SEAT. 
</P>

<P>
After all is said and done about this year's San Diego City Council election, 
Councilman Bob Filner believes that there is a simple explanation for the fact 
that Gloria McColl and Ed Struiksma will be leaving City Hall next month. 
</P>
<P>
"They played by the old rules, but the game had changed," Filner said Wednesday 
of his two defeated council colleagues. "They didn't recognize that -- or 
realized it too late -- so they lost." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the game in San Diego City Council campaigns has been dramatically 
changed by the shift to district-only races. If there was any doubt about that 
before Tuesday's election, the defeat of two council members and a third's 
narrow survival in the four races being contested made the point with a 
political thunderbolt heard by everyone in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changed dynamics either seen this year or forecast for future 
elections are: 
</P>
<P>
* Significantly reduced political security for incumbents, a shift largely 
attributable to the diminished role that high name recognition and huge 
campaign treasuries play in district races. 
</P>
<P>
* Virtually non-stop door-to-door politicking by incumbents, even in 
non-election years, in an effort to demonstrate attentiveness to their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
* A scramble by candidates accustomed to running glitzy mass-media campaigns to 
quickly master the techniques of grass-roots politics. 
</P>
<P>
* Campaigns waged on such widely divergent issues from one district to another 
that, as one consultant put it, "they'll look like they're being run on 
different planets." For example, even as slow-growth themes dominate one race, 
diametrically opposed calls for jobs and industrial development may head the 
agenda in an adjoining district. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's a different world with district elections," said consultant 
David Lewis, whose firm managed Struiksma's unsuccessful bid for a third 
four-year term. Referring to the four even-numbered council seats at stake in 
1991, Lewis added: "If I were an incumbent in districts 2, 4, 6 or 8 . . . I'd 
already be looking over my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Final unofficial returns showed that Abbe Wolfsheimer retained her 1st District 
seat in northwestern San Diego by only 571 votes over challenger Bob Trettin 
out of nearly 32,000 ballots cast -- 16,072 (50.9%) to 15,501 (49.1%). In the 
5th District, which covers the north-central portions of the city, former 
Wolfsheimer aide and land-use planner Linda Bernhardt defeated Struiksma by a 
surprisingly wide 3-to-2 margin, 13,704 votes (60.1%) to 9,094 (39.9%). 
</P>
<P>
McColl lost her 3rd District seat to longtime Normal Heights activist John 
Hartley in September's primary, and 7th District Councilwoman Judy McCarty was 
easily reelected in the primary against token opposition. 
</P>
<P>
All explanations for council incumbents' worst electoral performance in more 
than a decade -- before Tuesday, only one other councilman had lost a 
reelection campaign in the 1980s -- begin with last November's passage of 
Proposition E. The fifth such proposal put before San Diego voters in the past 
two decades, the measure replaced the city's former two-tiered election format 
-- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs between the top two 
vote-getters -- with district-only contests. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the strategies that had governed council campaigns for half a 
century were obliterated -- creating new political realities that, judging from 
the election results, challengers grasped better than incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
There is little question -- least of all among the candidates themselves -- 
that, were it not for the shift to district-only races, Hartley, Bernhardt and, 
perhaps, Wolfsheimer would not be preparing to take the oath of office next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbe possibly might have made it, but with the other two, absolutely, 
positively no way," said Hartley consultant Tom Shepard. Hartley and Bernhardt, 
in fact, have said that they probably would not have even bothered to run in a 
citywide race. 
</P>
<P>
"When an unknown like me can be outspent by a two-term incumbent and still win 
3-to-2, you have to say district elections made it possible," Bernhardt added. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's former election system, it was not uncommon for candidates 
defeated in the district primary to win citywide on the basis of their 
better-known names and fund-raising ability -- factors essential to reach a 
citywide electorate. Even with hundreds of volunteers, it is physically 
impossible for candidates to effectively cover a city of 1.1 million people, 
forcing them to rely on 30-second television and radio ads and mailers to reach 
voters they cannot hope to personally contact. 
</P>
<P>
By reducing the playing field in council races to one-eighth their former 
citywide size, however, district elections make an aggressive door-to-door 
campaign not only feasible, but almost mandatory. Indeed, one of the most 
frequent arguments for district elections is that they enable challengers to 
compensate with hard work for the financial and publicity advantages attendant 
to incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that, if you were an incumbent, the day after the primary you'd 
go out and buy $100,000 of TV time and blow away your opponent," Trettin 
consultant Jack Orr said. "It's not that simple any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Bernhardt and Hartley campaigns provided compelling case studies of the 
transformations brought about by district races. Relatively unknown and with 
limited sources of financing at the outset of their races, both constructed 
extensive grass-roots organizations and spent hundreds of hours walking door to 
door or telephoning voters. 
</P>
<P>
Although Struiksma and McColl did not ignore those necessities, they clearly 
were outmaneuvered and outhustled by their challengers. The critical error both 
incumbents made, consultants and others argue, was to run campaigns that had 
the look and feel of pre-Proposition E races -- heavily outspending their 
opponents, blitzing voters with mailers, taking false comfort in the fact that, 
even at race's end, they remained much better known than their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"They really didn't know how to run a grass-roots campaign, because they never 
had to under the old system," said Filner, who finished ahead of McColl in a 
1983 primary but then lost to her in the citywide runoff. "All they knew was 
how to run citywide." 
</P>
<P>
Viewing that explanation as an oversimplification, Struiksma consultant Lewis 
argues that other factors contributed to his candidate's defeat -- most 
notably, his staunch pro-development record in a district that suffers from 
severe traffic congestion and other problems traceable to growth. 
</P>
<P>
"People felt Ed was out of step on growth and told him so," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley adviser Shepard, however, contends that 5th District voters' discontent 
with Struiksma -- or toward any incumbent -- would have been politically 
insignificant in a citywide contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Struiksma always had this latent problem of discontent in his district," 
Shepard said. "To articulate that to a citywide audience would cost a 
challenger about $40,000. But you can do a good district mailer for about 
$5,000. So, Ed Struiksma's problem didn't become a serious issue for him until 
Linda Bernhardt could make it one for $5,000." 
</P>
<P>
At least on that point, Lewis concurs. One of the major issues in the 5th 
District race was Struiksma's support for the controversial 3,300-home Miramar 
Ranch North development, which drew intense opposition from nearby communities. 
In a citywide race, however, "that would have been only a minor blip, at most," 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1st District contest, Trettin, a former aide to county Supervisor Susan 
Golding and, before that, to the councilman who was unseated by Wolfsheimer in 
1985, Bill Mitchell, found himself in a more paradoxical position. 
</P>
<P>
His own consultant concedes that the 3% name recognition that Trettin began the 
campaign with would have been enough to scuttle his candidacy under the city's 
former election system. However, Orr also believes that, once Trettin narrowly 
survived the primary by edging the third-place finisher by 116 votes, he 
suffered because of the shift from citywide to district runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With strong financial backing from the development industry, Trettin was better 
positioned than most first-time candidates to wage a citywide campaign. In 
addition, Wolfsheimer's well-documented history of abrasive comments and an 
argumentative, sometimes patronizing style -- factors that have alienated many 
of her council colleagues -- arguably would have been a greater liability in a 
citywide contest than within her own district, where many residents see her as 
a scrappy, forceful advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Individual neighborhoods' enhanced clout under district races probably will 
force officeholders who previously spent more time talking about "remaining 
close" to their constituents than actually doing so to begin to match deeds to 
words. 
</P>
<P>
"Once voters feel their added power, the next step is for them to start asking 
candidates, 'Why am I only seeing you now during a campaign?' " said Filner, 
who regularly walks precincts in his district and expects to see other council 
members increasingly follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, for example, said Wednesday that she plans to resume her 
precinct-walking shortly after her inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
"One lesson of this election is you'd better be out there in the neighborhoods 
and put top priority on their needs, because if you're not, you're going to be 
gone," Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for some voters, the additional contact with candidates and their 
campaigns came to be seen this fall as perhaps a bit too much of a good thing. 
Because of the reduced campaign boundaries, so-called "high-propensity voters" 
-- those who vote most frequently -- were deluged with mailers and telephone 
calls. In the 5th District race, for example, Struiksma and Bernhardt sent out 
roughly 3 dozen mailers between them, contacts often complemented by phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a saturation point," Trettin said. "We were all calling and 
contacting a much smaller group of voters than you'd be going after in a 
citywide race. Even some of my supporters told me they were getting sick and 
tired of getting so many phone calls. People would say, 'Look, we're already 
going to vote for you, but this is getting ridiculous.' " 
</P>
<P>
As sometimes narrow district issues grow in importance, both legislatively and 
politically, under a district-only council, future council campaigns may 
increasingly reflect that diversity -- creating races that often may have 
little in common with one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect single-issue politics to really take off under district elections," 
said Trettin consultant Orr. "An issue important to one district, or even a 
single community, will outweigh citywide issues." 
</P>
<P>
Within political circles, the consensus is that the issue of growth, long a 
staple of San Diego politics, may remain a pivotal topic primarily in the 1st 
and 5th districts, simply because they include much of the city's vacant land 
available for development. The 8th District also has huge expanses of open 
space, but there many residents welcome growth for the jobs it brings -- giving 
the issue a different political slant. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, crime and the city's crumbling infrastructure may attract greater 
attention in the older communities of the 3rd and 4th districts than elsewhere 
in the city, while the long-running debate over the future of Lindbergh Field 
may never again be a major campaign issue outside the 2nd District, which is 
under the airport's takeoff path. 
</P>
<P>
One key component of political campaigns that apparently will not change under 
district elections is the amount of money spent in most of the races. Even with 
this year's geographically smaller contests, $250,000-plus campaigns remained 
the rule -- a price tag comparable to the amounts spent in the former 
district-citywide races. 
</P>
<P>
"That's never going to change," Orr concluded. "All district elections mean as 
far as money goes is that more and more dollars will be spent on fewer and 
fewer people. Maybe that's not so bad, because the first rule of advertising is 
repetition. And, since most people probably are less interested in candidates 
than toothpaste, it takes more repetition."

SAN DIEGO TO BE SITE OF INQUIRY ON POST OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: HEARINGS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH TO FOCUS ON THE STRESS 
QUESTION, AS WELL AS THE LEADERSHIP OF SAN DIEGO'S POSTMASTER. 
</P>

Calling San Diego County "the hot spot in the country" for postal problems, 
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said Wednesday that a congressional inquiry will 
be convened in San Diego early next month, and that particular attention will 
be paid to the leadership of local Postmaster Margaret Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Bates sent a letter last summer to the General Accounting Office calling for an 
investigation of the management practices of the U.S. Postal Service. His 
letter followed the Aug. 10 shooting rampage of John Merlin Taylor, an 
Escondido postal worker who killed his wife and two co-workers, then himself. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, the July 28 suicide of letter carrier William Camp had been the 
fourth among county postal workers this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the hearing, scheduled for Dec. 11 in the Federal Building downtown, 
will be chaired by Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.), chairman of the House 
subcommittee on postal operations and services. Also in attendance will be Rep. 
Charles A. Hayes (D-Ill.), chairman of the House subcommittee on postal 
personnel and modernization. Bates said he and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-San Diego) 
have been called to testify, and Postmaster Gen. Anthony Frank may attend the 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"McCloskey wants to focus on the stress question," Bates said. "He wants to 
find out why there's so much stress between postal supervisors and employees, 
particularly in San Diego. Budget crunches and quotas have been followed by a 
high number of disciplinary actions, especially here. But were they 
appropriate, and could any have been handled differently? We're not saying that 
anyone has the answers, but the truth is there's a troubling problem with the 
Postal Service all across the country, particularly in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Boyd, a spokesman for Sellers, said in a terse statement: 
</P>
<P>
"We always cooperate with the government and look forward to cooperating here. 
And that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he hopes the hearings will examine the slayings and suicides "in the 
context of extreme stress. We don't want to sensationalize or dramatize 
unfortunate incidents, but we do want to use them to point to and highlight the 
incredible stress that postal workers face. What used to be a cushy, soft, 
public-employment position is suddenly a real pressure cooker of a job." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he is concerned about the "inadequate" number of post offices in the 
county considering its "phenomenal growth." He cited in particular an Encanto 
post office that he said handles "a staggering volume" of mail and the rapidly 
expanding Otay Mesa area, which has no post office, merely a contract station 
that Bates said "processes an enormous parcel of mail." 
</P>
<P>
Asked, if Sellers' job is in danger, Bates said: "I don't think so. . . . She 
runs a tight ship, no question, but as to whether her job's on the line, I 
don't think I'd be in a spot to make that call, even if it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some really serious problems, though, that have to be looked 
at. San Diego is the hot spot in the country right now for postal problems. . . 
. That's why these guys are coming."

<P>
Last year, Apanel -- true to the contrary nature of the Doo Dah -- urged people 
not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find a place to park," his recording pointed out. "It won't be any 
fun. It's gonna be too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, he was contacted by Pasadena police and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they wanted to know what was going on," Apanel recalled. "They were 
getting calls from people who thought I was canceling the parade." 
</P>
<P>
So Apanel is playing it straight this year. His recording reminds would-be 
entrants that no motorized vehicles or animals are allowed as participants in 
the event, which is set for noon Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
But, he told The Times, he's hoping for a smaller crowd than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really advise people to go to the movies that day instead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rent-a-Cops go Madison Avenue: 
</P>
<P>
Westec Security, which provides private neighborhood patrols, has announced the 
establishment of a Westec News Bureau to furnish the media with the latest in 
"crime trends," "crime statistics" and "other subjects relating to peace of 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
What's next: the TV show? 
</P>
<P>
It's odd, in a way, that Ronald Reagan would apologize for remarking that he 
was "not too proud of Hollywood these days" and that Sony Corp.'s purchase of 
Columbia Pictures might be a step toward bringing back "decency and good taste" 
to American films. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's certainly not the first to rap Hollywood. It's almost a sport, 
especially within the industry. Consider these flashbacks: 
</P>
<P>
"Strip the phony tinsel off Hollywood," said humorist Oscar Levant, "and you'll 
find the real tinsel underneath." 
</P>
<P>
"The only 'ism Hollywood believes in is plagiarism," said Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, this view of Tinseltown from pioneer movie-maker D.W. Griffith: 
"It's a shame they took this country away from the rattlesnakes." 
</P>
<P>
Before we leave Tinseltown, let's ponder why Song's Automotive Service would 
display a giant cutout of Marilyn Monroe on its front gate. 
</P>
<P>
Is owner Kyongsop Song a rabid fan? Was this Monroe's favorite garage? 
</P>
<P>
Nah! 
</P>
<P>
Song just wants people to notice his Silver Lake-area shop. 
</P>
<P>
"If a customer of mine wants to tell someone else to come here, he just says, 
'Go to the mechanic with Marilyn Monroe out front,' " Song pointed out, 
logically enough. 
</P>
<P>
Song obtained the cutout of Monroe, as well as those of singers Bruce 
Springsteen and Donna Summer, from a nearby storage facility, where they had 
been left behind by a customer. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Song had the cutouts of Springsteen and Summer perched on his 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
"But they blew down," he said. "So I gave them to customers."

POMONA FIRM TO REMODEL CABRILLO BATHHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than two months of debate and delays, the Los Angeles Board of 
Recreation and Park Commissioners has selected a Pomona-based partnership to 
convert San Pedro's Cabrillo Beach bathhouse into a restaurant and retail 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The board reached its 3-0 decision Monday, with Commissioner Mary Nichols 
switching her vote to reverse a previous stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona partnership, which calls itself Hurricane Gulch Development Co. 
after the popular San Pedro windsurfing spot, now has the right to negotiate a 
30-year lease with the city. It was selected over a joint bid from the San 
Pedro Bay Co. and the Santa Monica-based Janss Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased, obviously," said Charles Pilcher, one of the four 
Hurricane Gulch partners, after the commissioners' vote. "We're very excited 
and very committed to this project." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Larson, the developer who heads the San Pedro Bay Co., left the meeting 
quietly after the vote. In an interview the next day, he said he wasn't 
surprised by the decision. "You roll with the punches." 
</P>
<P>
At two previous meetings, Larson, a San Pedro resident who has restored two 
buildings in the community's downtown, asserted that the Hurricane Gulch plan 
was not financially feasible and that the company could not do an adequate job 
of restoring the historic bathhouse on the budget it had projected. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said they had reservations about both bids, which differed vastly 
in the amount of revenue they projected for the city, with Hurricane Gulch 
proposing to pay more than 10 times as much in rent as San Pedro Bay Co. over a 
10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Hurricane Gulch proposal, the city will receive 6% of the gross 
receipts generated by the project. The San Pedro Bay Co. plan called for 
vendors in the project to pay Larson's company between 6% and 7% of their gross 
receipts, and for the city to receive 6% of that amount. A staff report to the 
commissioners said the difference amounted to $1.4 million, with Hurricane 
Gulch paying the city $2.8 million over 10 years and San Pedro Bay Co. paying 
$240,000. 
</P>
<P>
When the previous commission vote was taken Sept. 18, Nichols -- who had voiced 
the loudest concerns about preservation of the 70-year-old building -- 
advocated rejecting both plans and starting the bidding process again. But with 
only three of five commission members present, her plan failed to garner a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's meeting, Nichols said she switched her vote because she had 
viewed other examples of Pilcher's work and had checked several references he 
provided. She said she was convinced that Hurricane Gulch, which formed 
specifically for the bathhouse project, had "a genuine understanding . . . of 
how to deal with a historic building." 
</P>
<P>
The bathhouse, built in 1929, was home to the Cabrillo Marine Museum for 
decades, until the museum moved out in 1981. It has been vacant since then. 
Several years ago, city officials began looking for someone to renovate the 
20,000-square-foot building and lease it from the city on a long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
Parks officials say that although the Hurricane Gulch bid has been approved, it 
may be more than two years before work begins. The approval gives the city 
authority to negotiate a contract with Hurricane Gulch, and the contract must 
then be approved by the commissioners, the City Council and the state Coastal 
Commission, which has jurisdiction because the building is in the coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
Such delays have frustrated some community leaders, who have complained that in 
recent years the old bathhouse has been the target of vandalism and that the 
Recreation and Parks Department has allowed it to fall into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
But Julie Boxx, the official in charge of the bathhouse, said the building 
looks in worse shape than it is. She said a maintenance crew recently patched 
several holes vandals had punched in the building's walls.

CHALLENGERS SWEEP FIELD IN CENTINELA SCHOOL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbents generally fared well in South Bay school board elections Tuesday, 
but challengers swept the field in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District, a dramatic upset that could cause problems for Supt. McKinley Nash. 
</P>
<P>
The ousted incumbents -- Ann Birdsall, Aleta Collins and Herbert Bartelt -- 
were Nash's strongest supporters on the district's five-member board. Two of 
the victors -- Lawndale Planning Commission Chairwoman Pam Sturgeon and Lennox 
accountant Jacqueline Carrera -- have been critical of the superintendent. The 
third challenger elected, Amparo Font, a bilingual teacher from Hawthorne, has 
declined to offer an opinion on Nash. 
</P>
<P>
There already is talk that Tuesday's results augur drastic personnel changes in 
the school district, which has been beset by friction between the 
administration of Nash, who is black, and the union that represents the 
district's overwhelmingly white teaching corps. The union, the Centinela Valley 
Secondary Teachers Assn., endorsed Carrera and Sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Nash will be gone and the administrators will be changed," Birdsall 
predicted Tuesday night. "That really hurts me because those (people) in the 
administration have given their all." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating her victory at her campaign manager's house in Lawndale Tuesday 
night, Sturgeon stopped short of calling for Nash's ouster, saying only that 
she would like to tighten board control over the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Nash on Wednesday appeared to be waiting to see what the attitude of the 
district's new board members will be. "I intend to remain in this job if I can 
be productive for the students of this district," the superintendent said. "If 
I can't be productive I have no interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Tuesday's elections settled a total of seven South Bay school board 
races, including contests in Torrance, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, Hermosa 
Beach and Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
In the Torrance Unified School District, board incumbent Carol O'Brien lost to 
challenger John Eubanks, who came in second in a five-way race for three seats. 
The other winners were board President William Blischke, who ran third, and 
incumbent Ann Gallagher, who led the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Teachers Assn., which represents the district's 870 teachers, and 
the California School Employees Assn., composed of the district's 160 clerical 
workers, endorsed just two candidates in the race -- Eubanks and Blischke. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien expressed frustration at not drawing a union endorsement, saying the 
unions got "the best deal they've ever had in the last four years, and why they 
turned on this particular Board of Education, I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
In the Manhattan Beach City Elementary School District, voters returned two 
incumbents, RosaLee Saikley and Gary R. Collins, by comfortable margins. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance attorney Bernard O'Connor Jr. captured the third seat by outpolling 
Ronald G. Durham, another challenger. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor attributed his election to hard work: "I went to PTA meetings. I put 
up signs and sent out mailings. I made an effort to meet as many people as I 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said he and Saikley fared well because many Manhattan Beach residents 
feel their elementary school district is improving after years of declining 
enrollments and budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
In the El Segundo Unified School District, Tuesday's elections brought four new 
faces to the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butterworth, Nancy Wernick and Ken Schofield won four-year terms, and Keith 
R. Wise was elected to serve the two years remaining on the term of Andrew 
Wallet, who resigned last year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the casualties in the contest was Ruth Parks, the only incumbent in the 
race, and board appointee Timothy Chang, an attorney whom the state Supreme 
Court disbarred in July after finding that he misappropriated more than $7,000 
from a client, the Mellon Bank of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth attributed the defeats of Parks and Chang to public sentiment that 
the school board has been unresponsive to parents. He said his first order of 
business will be to begin negotiations with the teachers, whose contracts 
expire next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to begin face-to-face," Butterworth said. "Teachers feel they 
are underpaid, and we'll do the best we can for them." Schofield said he would 
like to see teachers get a 10% across-the-board pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hermosa Beach City School District, board incumbents Mary Lou Weiss and 
Lynne Gonzales were reelected to second terms, while challenger Gregory J. 
Kelsey, a commercial mortgage banker, captured the third seat up for grabs on 
the five-member board. Odd man out in the four-way race was challenger Bill 
Druar. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates agreed that a shortage of classroom space is the most pressing 
problem facing the crowded district, which has had to set up portable 
classrooms at its only school, the Hermosa Valley School. Other issues facing 
the board are the sale of excess school property, including the site of the 
now-defunct South School, and whether to merge with other beach city school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hawthorne School District there were no surprises as voters returned all 
three incumbents to the three seats at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Reelected by strong margins were John D. Andersen, a sales representative for a 
bottled water company, Rosemarie Caldwell, an account clerk with the Centinela 
Valley Union High School District, and Leslie V. Smullen, a supervisor for the 
U.S. Postal Service in Hawthorne.

HAWTHORNE LOSES PARK BID -- BUT HOLDS AN ACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign investors have outbid the city of Hawthorne for 5.8 acres of Caltrans 
property alongside the San Diego (405) Freeway, despite the city's insistence 
that it will not rezone the land, which is designated for park use. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth Jue said investors from Asia, South America and Europe 
have offered to pay nearly $1.5 million for the 21 parcels along Glasgow Place 
in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the city has sought to buy the narrow, mile-long strip on the west 
side of the freeway between Wiseburn and Rosecrans avenues for use as parkland. 
In September, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne) persuaded legislators 
to provide the city with $200,000 to buy the Glasgow strip. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jue said, the city offer of $200,000 for 20 parcels totaling 202,482 
square feet fell far short Tuesday of winning the bidding contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed but not surprised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said a city representative attending the real estate sale tried to inform 
the investors of the city's intentions for the land. But he said the investors 
either could not understand the city representative because they did not speak 
English or because they were unfamiliar with the zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
Selma Gleason, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, said eight investors offered a total 
of $1,473,864 for the parcels. She said each bidder spoke English and was 
notified in the bidding manual of the current zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Gleason declined to disclose the names or nationalities of the investors. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gleason, the bidders were required to place a deposit of $5,000. 
The deposit automatically gives a successful bidder one year to obtain 
rezoning, variances and clearances from the city. If the zoning or code changes 
cannot be obtained, the buyer can void the purchase agreement but must also 
forfeit the $5,000 deposit to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Two six-month extensions can be bought for $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, the City Council has maintained that the land, near the 
Holly Glen neighborhood, is not suitable for development, partly because of its 
closeness to the freeway. Single-family homes that once occupied the strip were 
demolished when Caltrans acquired the land. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said he believes that the investors will forfeit the property once they 
realize the city will not rezone.

MAN GETS 10 YEARS FOR BLUDGEONING TEEN-AGE COUPLE WITH A HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former mental patient who bludgeoned two teen-agers with a hammer was 
sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison Wednesday by a San Fernando Superior Court 
judge who complained that state law does not allow harsher punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John P. Farrell gave Rodolfo Aguero the maximum sentence allowed under 
state law for two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter with the special 
allegations of great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
With credit for time already served and for good behavior, Aguero, 36, of 
Granada Hills, could be released in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
Aguero was convicted last month of repeatedly hitting Kelly McClure, 19, and 
Jackson P. Utley, 18, over the head with a hammer as the teen-age sweethearts 
sat on a curb at the corner of Index Street and Montgomery Avenue, near 
Aguero's house, July 8, 1988. Both are permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sentences are wholly inadequate for violent crimes," Farrell said. 
"The sentencing scheme is far too low." 
</P>
<P>
California law sets minimum, mid-term and maximum penalties for all but murder 
and sex crimes. If a case involves multiple victims, however, the standards 
apply only to the first victim. Terms are greatly reduced for other victims. 
Aguero faced a maximum sentence of 8 1/2 years for the first victim and two 
years for the second. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the second person is cheap," Farrell said. He also complained 
that sentences are lower if a victim survives a violent attack. Farrell urged 
the victims' families to complain to state legislators if they were 
dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Aguero, who has a history of paranoid schizophrenia, should serve his term at 
the state prison at Vacaville, which has a psychiatric department, Farrell 
said. Four days after the attack, Aguero told authorities that voices told him 
people were laughing at him and he should punish them. During court 
proceedings, however, he refused to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
In court Wednesday, Utley's father, William Jackson Utley, pleaded for a stiff 
penalty. "Punishment and retribution are demanded," he said. "A society that is 
too effete to exact that cannot last." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Utley suffers memory loss and has virtually no feeling in his hands and 
legs. McClure still wears leg braces and cannot stand for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy McClure, Kelly McClure's mother, said the case demonstrates the danger of 
cutting funds for mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We would feel much better if we could be sure he would get help," she said. 
"We were lucky. The kids are really coming along, and it could have been a lot 
worse. But what about other victims in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Nelda K. Barrett told the court that Aguero, an 
immigrant from Nicaragua, does not have any recollection of the incident. She 
recommended he be sent to Vacaville.

DOMESTIC TROUBLES TOPPLE SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: A ONCE-POPULAR HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIAL WAS OUSTED AND THREE 
INCUMBENTS LOST IN THE KEPPEL ELEMENTARY DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The major changes wrought by school board elections in the Antelope Valley were 
the ouster of three incumbents in the small Keppel District and the defeat of 
the president of the Antelope Valley Union High School District, a former top 
vote-getter who became involved in a domestic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Almost complete, semi-official returns showed that about 9.5% of the region's 
voters -- well below the countywide turnout of 13.2% -- cast ballots Tuesday in 
eight Antelope Valley school district elections in which 44 candidates sought 
22 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, county probation officer William Olenick got more votes than 
any other school board candidate in the Antelope Valley to win a seat on a high 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
But he finished a surprisingly distant fifth among seven candidates following a 
much-publicized arrest in July on a complaint by his now-estranged wife that he 
had struck her. The district attorney's office declined to prosecute him, and 
his opponents did not make an issue of the arrest in their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the region's other major upset, incumbents Patricia Conner, Jerry Freeman 
and Robert Jones were ousted by challengers who complained of poor educational 
standards and other problems in the Keppel elementary school district, which 
covers Pearblossom and Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
In the 9,800-student Antelope Valley Union High School District, with three 
seats at stake, the top finishers were Parent Teacher Assn. president Sophia 
Waugh with 22.2% and advertising executive Steve Landaker with 21.4%. Larry 
Rucker, the only victorious incumbent, won the third seat and a third term with 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing them were school police officer Daniel Fricke, 10.6%; Olenick, 10.4%; 
phone company superintendent Phil Maher, 9.1%; and court financial officer 
David Von Buskirk, 6.4%. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 3,000-student Keppel Union School District, three incumbents and 
four challengers competed for three seats. The challengers winning office were 
school principal R. Michael Dutton, 20.7%; homemaker Valorie Gorny, 20.2%; and 
parks supervisor Richard Sanders, 14.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The ousted incumbents finished fourth, fifth and sixth. Freeman got 11.9%, 
Conner 11.2%, and Jones 11.1%. Trailing them was homemaker Claudia Moore with 
10.5%. Challengers had complained the district was suffering from high teacher 
turnover, low test scores and excessive administrative spending. 
</P>
<P>
In the 8,600-student Antelope Valley Community College District, two incumbents 
and two challengers sought three seats. Incumbents James Du Pratt Jr. and 
Herman Kicenski won reelection with 30.8% and 25.4% tallies. Former college 
spokeswoman Betty Lou Nash took the third seat with 28.9%, while insurance 
executive Felix Le Marinel trailed with 14.9%. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10,700-student Lancaster School District, all three incumbents on the 
ballot won reelection, fending off four challengers. Incumbents Melinda White 
and Michael Huggins, who both took office as a result of a February recall 
election, won new terms with 24.2% and 21.7%, respectively. Board President 
Richard White (no relation to Melinda White) won a second full term with 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Three challengers lost, led by air traffic controller Joseph Starling, who 
received 11.6%. Maridelle Wright, the wife of a former district superintendent 
who was ousted earlier this year, got 9.2%; Parent Teacher Assn. President 
Jacki Pendleton received 9%, and aircraft mechanic Keith Wilde, 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11,500-student Palmdale School District, Sheldon Epstein, a teacher in a 
sheriff's detention facility, topped two opponents to win a two-year term. 
Epstein got 45.1%, besting retired aerospace engineer Dan Hunter's 34.7% and 
the 20.1% tally for general contractor F. Don Linde. The seat belonged to 
former board member Susan Moulton, who resigned in June, leaving the four-year 
seat available for the remaining two years of the term. 
</P>
<P>
In the Eastside Union School District, incumbent Martha Johnson won reelection 
with 28.3%, while newcomers Larry Lake and Lee Doughty took vacant seats with 
votes of 25.4% and 21.4%, respectively. Lake is a rancher and businessman. 
Doughty is an educational consultant. Trailing them were Michael Terry with 
13.2% and Gary Holmes with 11.8%. 
</P>
<P>
In the Westside Union School District, homemaker Sandra Engebretson finished 
first with 22.1%. Two incumbents, Lynne Murley and Charles Strole, won 
reelection with 21.8% and 20.5%. The losing candidates were Larry Lindner,

WESTLAKE VILLAGE: THE CITY COUNCIL MAY ACT ON WESTLAKE NORTH BEFORE TWO NEW 
MEMBERS TAKE OFFICE. 
</P>

<P>
The top vote-getter in Tuesday's Westlake Village City Council election said 
Wednesday that his victory partly reflected opposition to a controversial 
development project called Westlake North. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, ex-city manager James E. Emmons, said voters "do not want to see 
the plan . . . approved." 
</P>
<P>
Voters elected Emmons, who was city manager from 1982 to 1988; incumbent 
Councilwoman Bonnie Klove, and homeowner association president Douglas R. 
Yarrow. 
</P>
<P>
They overwhelmingly defeated incumbent Councilman Irwin A. Shane. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons led the contest with 1,414 votes, or 30%. Yarrow had 1,212 votes, 25.7%, 
and Klove 849 votes, or 18%. 
</P>
<P>
Shane finished fifth with 324 votes, or 6.9%. Ahead of him was vocational 
teacher Sybil Nisenholz with 649 votes, or 13.8%. Joanne Robinson, an office 
manager for the California Highway Patrol, received 264 votes, or 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Shane agreed that voter anxiety over Westlake North played a major part in his 
defeat. The proposal is for 1.5 million square feet of office space and 250 
apartments or condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The election returns, Emmons said, indicate that "the citizens of Westlake do 
not want to see the plan that we currently know about approved. Myself and Doug 
Yarrow were probably the two strongest in our opposition to that plan of the 
six candidates." 
</P>
<P>
The council has scheduled decision hearings on the project for Nov. 15 and 16. 
But Emmons and Yarrow do not take office until Dec. 6. With Shane's defeat and 
Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier's decision not to seek reelection, the council now 
has two lame-duck members. 
</P>
<P>
"This matter is going to be dealt with by the council next week, and we will 
decide what we are going to do or not going to do or whether to continue it," 
Pelletier said. 
</P>
<P>
A ballot initiative to raise the city's constitutional spending limit passed 
overwhelmingly, with 89.5% voter support. About 37% of the city's 4,805 
registered voters cast ballots, City Manager Larry W. Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
Shane's defeat was not a major surprise to some Westlake Village political 
observers. Klove said many were surprised that Shane, 75, decided to seek 
reelection in the first place, since he narrowly avoided losing in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Shane had lost his effectiveness, and generally people wanted a more vibrant 
council," said Anthony Plaia, who lost to Shane by nine votes in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At a campaign forum last month, Shane said that one reason the council should 
make a quick decision on Westlake North is that "the developers are anxious to 
get started." 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier questioned whether Emmons could be objective about Westlake North 
because his property management company manages a 90,000-square-foot shopping 
center at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Lindero Canyon Road, near the project 
site. 
</P>
<P>
If the Westlake North decision is postponed, Emmons "is going to have to deal 
with that situation, which may or may not be a conflict of interest," Pelletier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons said his company has no ownership interest in the shopping center and 
merely manages the property. But he said he expects to ask the city attorney 
for an opinion if any potential conflict arises once he is on the council.

MIRALESTE CLOSURE FOES LOSE AT POLLS BUT VOW TO FIGHT ON IN COURT

Even though they lost decisively among voters on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 
east-side school board candidates said Wednesday that they will press forward 
with the legal fight to keep their neighborhood high school open. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the place we have always prevailed, where there is a real sense of 
justice," said Barry Hildebrand, an east-side resident who ran for one of the 
three open seats on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to roll over and die. Hell, no," he added. "I think the 
(east-side) community is really aroused now." 
</P>
<P>
Hildebrand, along with Peter Gardiner and Marianne Kipper, campaigned as a 
slate, hoping to become the majority on the five-member board. The trio are 
former directors of an east-side parents' group that has been fighting to 
overturn the present board's decision in November, 1987, to close Miraleste 
High School -- the only high school on the east side of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a large voter turnout on the east side -- Hildebrand said the slate 
estimates that 60% of the voters in the area went to the polls -- incumbents 
Jeffrey Younggren and Marlys Kinnel handily won reelection against the slate 
candidates and a fourth opponent, Brigitte Schuegraf. 
</P>
<P>
Brenton Goodrich, who had aligned himself with the incumbents, also easily won 
election, finishing third with 8,538 votes. Of the losers, Gardiner collected 
the most votes, 6,480, still 2,059 short of winning a seat. In the school 
district, 15,162 people voted, a turnout of 36%; countywide, the average voter 
turnout was 13.2% 
</P>
<P>
"I am elated," Younggren said late Tuesday night when the election's outcome 
was evident. "Over the last couple of years, you begin to wonder where the 
community support is." 
</P>
<P>
Younggren was referring to the low profile of district supporters during 
acrimonious attacks on the board since its unanimous vote to close Miraleste 
because of declining enrollment districtwide. In the wake of that decision, the 
east-side parents' group, the East Peninsula Educational Council, was 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
Younggren, Kinnel and Goodrich said the election clears the way for the 
district to move forward and eventually close Miraleste. The three campaigned 
on a theme that money saved from closing Miraleste as a high school should be 
used to expand the curriculum at the district's Rolling Hills and Palos Verdes 
Estates high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnel said she hopes that the bitterness between the present board and their 
east-side opponents will now dissipate and that both sides will start working 
together again on school issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a two-way street," Kinnel said. "We want to do it. We don't know 
when they will be ready to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kipper said the east-side candidates knew from the start that they were 
"outnumbered" because more voters live on the west side of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the party in Rancho Palos Verdes on Tuesday night where the winners 
gathered, Younggren called the results an overwhelming vote of confidence in 
the present board, adding: "The community has made a clear statement that they 
are not going to tolerate this kind of nonsense. I think the community at large 
is tired of the personal attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Besides launching a drive to keep the high school open, the east-side parents' 
group has also alleged that the present board and top district administrators 
mishandled the sale of surplus school property. The group also contends that 
present board members cost the district hundreds of thousands of dollars when 
they retroactively approved fee exemptions in 1987 to local developers. 
</P>
<P>
Board members deny any wrongdoing. During the campaign, they contended that the 
group's allegations stem solely from the desire to keep Miraleste open. 
Younggren, the board's current president, has repeatedly accused district 
critics of launching a "witch hunt" that ultimately led to the resignation in 
early October of Jack Price, district superintendent for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Kipper and her running mates said that while they are disappointed in the 
election's outcome, their spirits are buoyed by the large number of east-side 
residents who voted for them. The votes showed that there is widespread concern 
on the east side about district affairs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The trio said the parents' group will now focus its energies on the legal 
challenge it has mounted to keep Miraleste open. The district, as a result of 
the group's lawsuit against it, is preparing a court-ordered environmental 
impact report on the Miraleste closing and other closures throughout the 
district.

PROTECTING THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glidden's view of the desert is obscured by smog so thick that he has lost 
touch with reality. He attempts to convey the illusion that the desert is 
populated by 19th-Century squatters living in shacks next to slag heaps. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the vast majority of the 300,000-plus people in the California 
desert are living in the 20th Century and are against the desert closure bill. 
</P>
<P>
Mining is the largest industry in the desert, and the value of industrial 
minerals mined in the California desert is greater than any other state. We 
cannot afford the cost of losing this industry upon which urban and desert 
dwellers depend every day of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called beautiful "crown jewels" when viewed in the smog-free air and 
compared to other mountain ranges become ordinary mountains not worthy of the 
title jewels but simply rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
Urban dwellers like Glidden have only viewed the desert on TV, but if they 
would try to walk across the desert in the summer heat (120-plus degrees) they 
would be exposed to stark reality. This desert "wilderness" is no place to be 
without roads. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important fact Glidden failed to see is that the Bureau of 
Land Management (a federal agency) already has in place a federally approved 
multiple-use land management plan, which includes wilderness areas, but which 
also allows the best land use planning, accommodating urban and desert dwellers 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The desert belongs to the people and is now accessible to them. The desert 
should not be protected from them.

THIS ISN'T KID-GLOVE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senators are entitled to respect for what they are -- moving parts in the 
machinery of democracy. But they are not entitled to kid-glove treatment for 
just anything they do. There are now enough serious questions about precisely 
why four senators met with the chief savings and loan regulator on April 2, 
1987, for the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics to abandon the kid gloves and 
get answers to those questions. If it requires appointment of an independent 
counsel, the committee should not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
Two elements have honed the edge on the questions the committee needs to ask. 
One is testimony by Edwin J. Gray, who was then chairman of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board. The other is some apparent shifting around in the recollection 
of one participant in the meeting, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), of what went 
on during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gray contends that the senators wanted him to withdraw a regulation that was 
opposed by Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan or 
Irvine and a major campaign contributor to Cranston, and Sens. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Cranston originally said he was astonished that Gray would say such a thing; 
later he said that there might have been some such discussion. Cranston also 
said the Gray either misunderstood what happened at the meeting or made up his 
version. 
</P>
<P>
What is involved here goes beyond the question of who is telling the truth and 
who is not. What is wanted is a far sharper picture of the relationships 
between politicians and savings banks during years when the banks squandered 
billions of dollars, money that taxpayers will spend years making up. We may be 
old-fashioned, but getting that picture would seem to be worth any trouble the 
Ethics committee might have to go to.

HARDEMAN'S LEGAL FEES CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council has hired an outside attorney to challenge nearly 
$250,000 in fees being sought by the lawyers who represented Councilman Garland 
Hardeman in his two-year legal battle that overturned the 1987 council 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The city will argue at a Dec. 15 hearing before Superior Court Judge Leon 
Savitch that Hardeman's 1987 lawsuit against Ervin (Tony) Thomas and the city 
was for private, not public, benefit. Even if it did benefit the public, City 
Atty. Howard Rosten said, the city maintains that it should not be required to 
pay legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Borenstein, who represented Hardeman, said Thomas and the city are liable 
for the fees because the case provided "substantial benefit to the 4th District 
voters" in overturning a fraudulent election. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle &amp; Taylor, Borenstein's firm, is seeking about $200,000, while the 
additional $50,000 would go to the Center for Law in the Public Interest, which 
also represented Hardeman.

GUARD HELD IN TORRANCE SLAYING WAS ON PAROLE

A former security guard arrested this week in the murder of a woman in a 
Torrance townhouse complex was on parole for a felony assault conviction at the 
time he was hired to patrol the gated complex where the victim lived, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Brian Campbell was released from Folsom State Prison in November, 1988, 
after serving four years of a seven-year sentence for assault with a deadly 
weapon. He was working for Transworld Security Systems at the Park Del Amo 
development in Torrance on May 31 when he allegedly strangled Tracy Morrigan, 
26, police said. The security firm and Watt Homes Inc., which built Park Del 
Amo, did not respond to requests for comment.

...AS BUSH'S VISION DIMS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: IT WASN'T ABORTION THAT SUNK THE GOP. IT WAS THE FAILURE OF GOP 
LEADERS TO OFFER A VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAL THOMAS, Cal Thomas is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's "off year" election was not a referendum on abortion, race or any 
other single issue. It was a referendum on vision -- and Republicans were 
defeated all over the country because they have lost theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Republican inability to read the political eye chart was revealed by the 
party's leader at his Tuesday news conference. Speaking on the abortion issue 
(though the subject could as easily have been capital gains taxes), President 
Bush, who had made some gains among conservatives for what they had perceived 
as a principled pro-life stand, said, "We have room in our party for people 
that feel one way, pro-life or pro-choice. The Democratic Party is the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party is not the same way. Few staunchly pro-life Democrats 
could be elected to anything above the level of dog catcher, and no one could 
hope to be nominated for President in the Democratic Party if he or she is not 
convincingly pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
This is what is killing Republicans from coast to coast. Voters don't want 
accommodaters. They want leaders with strong convictions who will tell them 
what is right and wrong and why. They want visionaries who will lead them 
toward a defined goal. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's election campaign, President Bush didn't say that there was 
room in the Republican Party for those who thought Willie Horton ought to be 
out on parole, or room for flag burners along with those who would protect the 
national symbol. He took a stand. He had a vision. And the people followed. 
</P>
<P>
Now he complains that Congress is "blocking everything I try to do." And why 
shouldn't they? The "Mr. Nice Guy" image may work at country clubs, but it is 
suicide in politics. At a prize fight the biggest cheers don't come when the 
combatants shake hands before the fight, but when the slugging starts. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one reason for winning the presidency and it has nothing to do 
with promoting kindness and gentleness. It has to do with exercising power to 
promote the general welfare. 
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the general welfare, though, one must define the general 
welfare. It does not excite conservative voters, who provided President Bush 
with his margin of victory, when they hear him say that abortion, for example, 
is not the most important issue "for me . . . absolutely not." There is only 
one reason to oppose abortion and that is because one believes it is the taking 
of innocent human life. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush can't get worked up over the most emotional issue our society 
faces, what issue will light a fire under him? 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Courter lost support early on in the New Jersey governor's race 
because he tried to accommodate the pro-choicers by softening his pro-life 
position. Pro-choicers already had one of their own in Rep. James Florio, so 
why should they vote for Courter? They didn't and neither did many pro-lifers, 
who stayed home and watched Courter lose by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, though the margin was tight, Marshall Coleman assured voters that 
if elected governor he would not do anything to change the abortion status quo. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the kind of talk that energizes conservatives to go out and vote, 
and it is not the kind of talk that will produce victories for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have a case of political cataracts. If they don't have them 
removed, they risk going blind and having to be led around by Democrats.

ON TUESDAY, WHITE AMERICA CAME OF AGE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: WHEN REASON SURPASSES RACE OR SEX IN VOTING, THE BEST MEN AND WOMEN 
WIN -- AND THEY DID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
On Tuesday, with the election of Doug Wilder, a descendant of slaves, as 
governor of Virginia, America completed an historic cycle. In the 1960s, we 
integrated the lunch counters and the libraries. Today we are integrating the 
mind of America and the leadership of our country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1619, slave ships landed in Jamestown, Va., bearing Gov.-elect Wilder's 
forebears who were Africans shackled in chains to be sold as chattel. The 
Constitution would later define us as three-fifths human. In the journey from 
the holds of these ships to the governor's office under the Capitol dome in 
Richmond, remarkable changes have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
This magnificent journey, from slave ship to championship, marks a great moment 
in American history that should make all of us proud to be Americans -- without 
a hyphen. Such victories make us as a nation less racist, less sexist -- more 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom is that African American and women candidates somehow 
are changing. The reality is that white male America is maturing. It is 
becoming more secure in this multiracial and multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
There were other victories and milestones. New Yorkers elected David Dinkins 
the first African American mayor of their city. John Daniels in New Haven and 
Norm Rice in Seattle hurdled the race barrier to become the first African 
American mayors of their hometowns. Two Arab American women attained public 
office: Suzanne Sarieni won election to the Dearborn, Mich., City Council and 
Betty Esper became mayor of Homestead, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
There are still those hostile to the empowerment of African Americans, Latinos, 
women and other minorities. But they are on the losing side of history even if 
they gain aid and comfort from the deficit of moral leadership in the White 
House -- the absence of a chief civil-rights officer in the Justice Department, 
the lack of an effective Equal Employment Opportunity Commission chief and a 
Civil Rights Commission without credibility. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with these failures of leadership, a maturing white America is 
choosing a better course over a bitter course. 
</P>
<P>
This is the real story of Tuesday's election results. It is not news that 
qualified African Americans and women ran for public office. It is news that 
white Americans voted for them in sufficient numbers to give them well-earned 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of our Republic, full citizenship was limited to white male 
landowners over the age of 25. The Big Lie of white male supremacy made the 
country sick, divided it and caused fear, hatred, violence and, lest we forget, 
was a crucial factor in starting the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
The great struggle of America has been to open up the democracy to locked-out 
groups. Just last Sunday, the Southern Poverty Law Center dedicated a memorial 
in Montgomery, Ala., to the people who gave their lives in the modern 
civil-rights movement. The stones of bigotry, hostility and prejudice are being 
rolled away, giving way to resurrection, the joy of a new day. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that candidates could prey easily on white male racial and sexual 
fears with racially based campaigning, like the Willie Horton ad. But white 
voters are increasingly rejecting such appeals as insulting and anachronistic. 
They are tired of candidates waving American flags made in Taiwan. When reason 
surpasses race as the thought process of voters, we all win. 
</P>
<P>
I could see the change in white America's attitudes unfolding during the 1988 
presidential primaries. I saw it in the face of the farmer who told me he would 
rather vote for "a black friend than a white enemy." 
</P>
<P>
This maturation phenomenon is a political process. It takes time and 
organization.It is no mere coincidence that the cities breaking through on 
Tuesday and electing African American mayors -- New York, New Haven, Seattle, 
Cleveland -- also gave their votes to the African American candidate in last 
year's Democratic presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that African Americans were not ready for leadership before. We were 
qualified to play baseball before 1947, to go to public school with whites 
before 1954, to sit on the bus before 1955, to eat a hamburger in an integrated 
restaurant before 1964, to vote without harassment before 1965 and to live in 
fair housing before 1968. We have moved up, not according to our ability, but 
according to the speed with which whites were able to overcome their unfounded 
fears and insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
But our movement upward has benefited all people, who are finally being given a 
chance to develop to their highest potential. Our movement historically has 
opened doors for white women, such as Kathy Whitmire, just reelected to her 
fifth term as mayor of Houston, Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska and Sen. Barbara 
Mikulski of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The the decline of racism and sexism also benefits white men, who can finally 
realize their potential, not by domination but by solidarity and connection 
with other human beings. The success of one of us enriches us all. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine where we would be as a society today without the legacy of racism and 
sexism. We would be more educated, more productive, more virtuous, more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
But after Tuesday's elections, we are now one important step closer to that day 
when, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we in America judge other 
people not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
</P>
<P>
That America is the best America, our promise and our dream.

GIVE ALLIES THE LEAD, BUT HOLD REINS; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: IF THE UNITED STATES NEED NO LONGER BE THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE'S CEO, IT 
MUST REMAIN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD. 
</P>

By GREGORY F. TREVERTON, Gregory F. Treverton, a senior fellow and director of 
the Europe-America Project at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, is

The only thing worse than not consulting the Japanese, a government colleague 
of mine used to say, is consulting the Japanese. So it is with America's allies 
in Europe. Too much leadership is bullying or high-handed; too little is 
weakness or indecision. Now is the time for the United States to let its 
European allies take the lead over Eastern Europe, but it is not the time for 
us to leave Europe to the Europeans. If the United States need no longer be the 
Atlantic Alliance's CEO, it must remain the chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is the center of Europe, the two Germanys. The underlying question 
is whether the nature of the state system in Europe has changed enough -- or is 
in the process of doing so -- so that old worries are no more. The postwar 
division, for all its unhappiness, did solve Europe's historic problem. 
Dividing Germany and embedding the western half in NATO created, as the old 
saying had it, a Germany that was strong enough to stand up to the Soviet Union 
but not so strong as to threaten Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns may be old-fashioned. After all, the Federal Republic is a secure 
democracy now, and it is not as if Europeans have learned nothing from the last 
40 years. The European Community, for all its shortcomings, is an impressive 
achievement in cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in this century, Europe's record at ordering its affairs when left alone is 
unimpressive, to put it gently. For all the euphoria over freedom's march in 
Eastern Europe, there are more than a few echoes of the period between the 
wars. Now, as then, German influence -- this time West Germany and primarily 
economic -- is spreading through Eastern Europe. As the hand of the Soviet 
Union lightens there, old antagonisms are resurfacing, most notable that 
between Hungary and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Franco-German ties that exist now are a far cry from the period before World 
War II. Still, the Franco-German connection is weak and uneven, its ups and 
downs determined all too visibly by cycles of French concern over its neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, there is no strong Anglo-French understanding to serve as an 
anchor in the European Community for the Federal Republic. Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher has stubbornly pursued her own view of Europe, akin to that 
of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, as one of sovereign states, not of supranational 
institutions. Whatever the merits of her vision, it has taken Britain out of 
the game, leaving a vacuum at Europe's center. 
</P>
<P>
All politics is local politics, Tip O'Neill is credited with saying, and that 
seems true in spades for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He seems so preoccupied with 
reform at home that he has little time for even those foreign relations that 
have been most critical to Moscow -- Eastern Europe. Implicitly, he seems to be 
saying that he will deal with Eastern Europe, even perhaps Germany, later. He 
does have 400,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany; while his spokesmen 
occasionally hint that Soviet troops might leave Hungary and Poland, East 
Germany is never on the list. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing stream of East Germans fleeing their county is a reminder of 
just how unpredictable the future will be and how fast that future may arrive. 
The best of America's experts on East Germany, who are dismayingly few in any 
case, were badly wrong about the events of this summer and fall; a year ago 
they were talking of East Germany's "success." That East Germans -- Prussians, 
after all -- would be satisfied because their standard of living was better 
than Poland's seems laughable in retrospect. It should at least make for 
humility and an awareness that whatever designs we conceive will be badly 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that is no excuse for not thinking ahead, still less for leaving it all to 
the Europeans. When President Bush meets with Gorbachev, reassuring him that 
the West has no designs on Eastern Europe is important. But reassurance and 
listening so "not to miss anything," as the President put it, are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
He needs also to indicate America's willingness to stay in Europe, with 
military forces, for some time to come. He needs to stress that our primary 
goal in Eastern Europe is political and economic change -- "Finlandization," 
though he would not put it that way -- not dismantling the military alliances. 
That can come later, if at all. So, too, while the United States cannot be in 
the position of preventing its German ally from achieving its dreams about 
countrymen to the east, the President also needs to be plain that the questions 
at issue are not ones for Germans alone. Other Europeans have large stakes. And 
so does the transatlantic chairman of the board.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mother Butterbreast, otherwise known as KFMB radio personality Joe Bauer, was 
named the winner Wednesday in the "honorary mayor" fund-raising election 
sponsored by the Assn. of Retarded Citizens of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer edged out rival radio personality Roger Hedgecock, the former real mayor 
of San Diego, with 7,892 votes to Hedgecock's 6,617. San Diegans were asked to 
donate $1 for each vote tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
A total of $15,417 was raised. It will go toward programs for the retarded in 
San Diego, including Eggie's restaurant on University Avenue in North Park, 
where Wednesday's announcement was made. Eggie's is owned and operated by 
mentally impaired people who are clients of the Assn. of Retarded citizens. 
</P>
<P>
ARC officials said that Hedgecock was the early leader in the race but that 
Bauer pulled ahead at the finish. Other candidates were San Diego Union 
columnist Michael Grant (641 votes) and traffic reporter Monica Zech (282 
votes).

RAPIDLY MULTIPLYING FLY IS ABOUT TO MEET SOME UNFRIENDLY WASPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first volley in a carefully plotted biological war against the ash whitefly 
will be fired next week when researchers hunting for ways to control the 
destructive and rapidly multiplying pest release 50 parasitic wasps. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the wasps, which do not sting humans and are smaller than a 
pinhead, will slow the spread of the whitefly, which has defoliated trees from 
the Mexican border to Sacramento and is viewed as a substantial threat to the 
state's thriving nursery and citrus industries. 
</P>
<P>
One week from today, small vials containing the tiny wasps will be uncorked 
beneath the branches of whitefly-infested ash trees in the San Fernando Valley, 
scientists at UC Riverside said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That action will be followed later this month by similar test releases in 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. In all, 300 of the 
specially imported wasps will be deployed this fall, with as many as 10,000 
more scheduled for release in the spring of 1990. The black-and-gold wasps, 
which were imported from Israel and Italy in midsummer and have been 
reproducing in UC Riverside's federally approved quarantine laboratory ever 
since, are parasitic insects that can only multiply by laying their eggs within 
the whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
A female wasp inserts her eggs into a juvenile whitefly, known as a "nymph," 
through a tube called an ovipositor. The wasp larvae then develops by feeding 
off the tissue of the whitefly, which ultimately dies when the wasp becomes 
mature and chews its way out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's classic biological control, and we have every reason to be confident that 
this project will succeed," said Tim Paine, an associate professor of 
entomology at UC Riverside, where scientists are working with $95,200 in 
emergency grants to combat the whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if the wasps prove effective against the whitefly, residents 
irked by the swarming pest and growers fearful of its threat to crops are not 
likely to detect any sign of population reduction for at least two years, 
scientists say. As for the 300 wasps being turned loose this month, they are 
not expected to slow the whiteflies' spread at all. Rather, Paine said, it is a 
means for determining how the imported parasites will fare in Southern 
California's winter climate. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasp has reproduced successfully in the laboratory, so we want to see how 
it does under realistic conditions," Paine said. "We also recognize there is a 
lot of public concern about the whitefly and we're anxious to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Larger releases are not possible yet because not enough wasps have reproduced, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the whitefly was first spotted in California at a Van Nuys fruit stand in 
August, 1988, state agricultural officials and scientists have mostly been 
forced to watch helplessly as the non-native pest swarmed through the state -- 
free of the natural predators that control its population in Europe and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown some pesticides are effective against the whitefly, but only 
as short-term measures: trees are reinfested within a week. Moreover, because 
the whitefly has infested such vast areas -- many of them heavily populated -- 
widespread insecticide spraying is viewed as impractical and undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
Also, whitefly eggs have proven difficult to treat with pesticides because they 
are laid on the underside of leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, scientists are hoping biological control will do the trick, and 
eight species of enemy insects have been imported for study at UC Riverside. In 
addition to the parasitic wasps, there are wasps that paralyze and kill 
whiteflies outright as well as two predatory beetles from Israel, relatives of 
those that eat aphids on roses. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only two of the wasp species have reproduced in the laboratory, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the whitefly -- which weakens and ultimately defoliates 
trees by sucking the juices out of their leaves -- was accidentally imported 
from Europe or the Middle East. While so far its destructiveness has been 
limited to shade trees and back yard fruit trees, scientists say it is only a 
matter of time before the state's $634-million citrus industry is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the pest has made life miserable for residents in many heavily 
infested areas of Southern California, spoiling barbecues and ruining patio 
furniture and automobile paint jobs with the sticky secretion it leaves behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been here 15 months, and its population explosion has been 
incredible," Paine said. "Last year, we could barely find it in Riverside, and 
now it's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Agricultural Commission member Edouard Layaye agreed: "We 
had maybe one or two calls on it last year. This year, we get 20 calls a day."

KINGS CAN'T HOLD THREE-GOAL LEAD AGAINST FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings lost, once again, to the Calgary Flames, the defending Stanley Cup 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
That might not sound so bad, but they blew a three-goal lead along the way. And 
it was a rookie who scored the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
Flame rookie Paul Ranheim knocked a puck out of the air and past a flustered 
Kelly Hrudey for Calgary's 5-4 victory before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the 
Forum Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have lost four in a row, dropping to 7-10 and falling into a 
three-way tie for last place in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, who have won three in a row, increased their lead in the Smythe 
Division to seven points, improving their record to 10-4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Including this season's two losses, the Kings have been defeated by the Flames 
10 times in a row, dating to last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the winning goal, Ranheim said: "Theoren (Fleury) was driving down the left 
side and the pass was meant for Mark Hunter, but I didn't know that at the 
time. I reached out and got a piece of it when it was about two feet above the 
ice, and it floated in. It seemed like it took all day to go in. Hrudey was 
going to his left, and there's no way he's getting it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
There have been too many of those things for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
King General Manager Rogie Vachon said before the game that there would be some 
changes made if things don't turn around soon. 
</P>
<P>
But owner Bruce McNall was so distressed after the game that when asked if 
there would be any moves made, he said: "You don't want to panic when you're in 
a rut. Besides, I don't want to let any of these guys go now. I want them to 
suffer along with me and all the fans in L.A. I don't want to let anyone out of 
this hole." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, for one, is visibly suffering. Looking shaken, he went over the 
same ground he has covered after the last few losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're frustrated as a team. We're disappointed in ourselves. It hurts to lose. 
It's hard "(Calgary) played strong. They came back hard. But we got ourselves 
in penalty trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Not a good idea against the Flames, the best power-play team in the league. The 
Flames scored three of their goals on power plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the power play killed us," King assistant Cap Raeder said. 
"Five on five, I thought we did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Raeder was standing in for King Coach Tom Webster, who was behind the bench for 
the start of the game, but when the team came out for the start of the second 
period, his assistants had taken over. Webster was back in the locker room, 
where he had been advised to stay because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Kings have taken turns with the flu bug in the last few weeks, 
and they apparently passed it on to their coach. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gretzky has escaped the bug. He had a goal and two assists against the 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had put the Kings ahead, 3-1, with a goal 37 seconds into the second 
period. The score came after Gretzky had put a centering pass in front of the 
net, hoping to set up his teammates. Instead, the puck glanced off the skate of 
Calgary's Dana Murzyn and past goaltender Rick Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky set up another score when he sent a pass from behind the net to Hubie 
McDonough, who flipped the puck past Wamsley, giving the Kings a 4-1 lead at 
5:17 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings were unable to put the Flames away. 
</P>
<P>
Al MacInnis, star of the Stanley Cup finals, led the charge as the Flames tied 
the game before the end of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
On a power play, MacInnis sent a pass from the left-side boards out to Gary 
Suter, who scored on a slap shot at 11:51. 
</P>
<P>
At 17:06, King defenseman Petr Prajsler left Gary Roberts alone in front of 
Hrudey. Roberts took advantage by scoring on a shot that hit the left post and 
ricocheted behind the King goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
One of MacInnis' powerful slap shots from the blue line found its way through a 
lot of skates and legs and bounced off Mark Hunter's leg for the tying goal at 
18:05. Hunter, taking advantage of the power play, had planted himself right in 
front of Hrudey, blocking the goaltender's view of MacInnis. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey never saw what hit Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
At least the Kings got Hrudey some goals this time. The last time these teams 
played, the Flames embarrassed the Kings before their home crowd with a 5-0 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings avoided a shutout with two early goals -- one that Steve Kasper 
pushed into the left side of the net after Luc Robitaille had redirected a 
centering pass from Gretzky, and a second on the power play that John Tonelli 
scored off a pass from Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter put the Flames back within a goal with his first score of the night, a 
power-play goal that he shot directly off a pass from Doug Gilmour. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have not won at home since beating Detroit Oct. 8. . . . Mike 
Krushelnyski is expected to be back from his wrist injury and in the lineup for 
the game Saturday. . . . Barry Beck shook off the flu to play Wednesday night, 
but a puck hit his right thumb during the first period and he missed the rest 
of the game. The X-rays showed no break. . . . Marty McSorley played on a line 
with Jim Fox and Mike Allison Wednesday night. McSorley has played at forward 
almost as much as he has served as a defenseman this season. In the game at 
Boston he was moved back and forth in the course of the game. Asked if he 
considered McSorley a forward who could also be a defenseman or a defenseman 
who could also be a forward, Coach Tom Webster said: "I don't think of him as 
either. I think of him as both." . . . In 10 consecutive losses to the Flames, 
the Kings have been outscored, 61-31.

AZTECS FACE BIG JUMP IN DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without a quick turnaround at the gate, an infusion of university or private 
funds or severe budget cuts, the San Diego State athletic department is facing 
its biggest annual financial deficit in almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is critical enough that the department has purchased half-page 
advertisements in local newspapers today and Friday, urging people to attend 
the Aztecs' final two home football games against Wyoming Saturday and Brigham 
Young Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The ads, placed at a cost of $6,700, are in the form of an open letter to the 
community from Athletic Director Fred Miller explaining the importance of 
football ticket sales to the department's financial health. The ads ask for the 
public's support in light of the team's four-game winning streak and 5-3-1 
record, its best in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But the late push might not be enough to ward off a crisis. The troubles, 
building for several years, are being compounded by a steep drop in home 
football attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance has averaged 19,161 for the first five of seven home games in 
60,409-seat San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. That is a decrease from last year's 
average of 22,398 for five home dates. 
</P>
<P>
University officials have declined to discuss actual sales figures until the 
end of the season. But if the trend continues, the department will finish more 
than $200,000 short in football ticket revenue, according to William Erickson, 
university vice president for business and financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The department is in danger of adding significantly to its overall deficit of 
$510,000. SDSU President Thomas Day has said that a $700,000 deficit would 
endanger the athletic department's ability to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in such a desperate state for so long that this year we are 
finally having to pay the piper," said Kathryn Wullner, chairman of the SDSU 
Intercollegiate Athletic Authority (IAA), the board that oversees the athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Wullner said that slashing the budgets of non-revenue sports such as tennis and 
golf might not be enough to solve the problem and that the board might begin 
looking at cutting football expenditures in areas such as accommodations and 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if putting the guys up in a hotel the night before a home game is 
really necessary," Wullner said. "These are things we have to look at. We're 
starting to feel a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal crisis has the potential to be the worst since a series of reversals 
took the department from a surplus of $427,000 at the end of 1979-80 to a 
$433,000 deficit three years later. 
</P>
<P>
This year's problems come after a 1988-89 budget year in which $39,000 was 
added to the deficit. That figure could have have been much higher, but the 
department avoided adding an additional $254,000 in new debt by transferring 
funds from other department and university accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the money -- about $184,000 -- came from surplus university 
funds in areas not related to instruction or student services, Erickson said. 
The money was used to help pay the salaries of department employees whose 
positions originally were to be funded out of athletic department revenue. 
"Athletics is part of the university, and we wanted to help them try to meet 
their budget," Erickson said. "We could put a lot more into athletics, but we 
have been very reluctant to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The department also took $109,000 raised by individual sports for their use -- 
called earmarked funds -- and applied it to the general budget with the promise 
to repay those sports this year. But some of the repayment was offset by budget 
reductions in those sports. 
</P>
<P>
Without similar funding measures or budget cuts, department officials are 
concerned that the department's overall deficit for the fiscal year that ends 
June 30 could surpass its record level of $552,000 at the end of the 1984-85 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for crisis exists because revenue projections for two of the 
department's most significant revenue sources -- football ticket sales and 
fund-raising by the Aztec Athletic Foundation (AAF) -- appear now to have been 
overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Football season ticket sales brought in $612,000, almost $106,000 less than 
budgeted. Single-game sales for the first five home games have fallen short of 
projections, and early prospects for a two-game surge are not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, a crowd of 20,000 was expected for Wyoming and about 25,000 
for BYU, said Vicki Larsen, SDSU's ticket manager. Both would be substantially 
below preseason projections. 
</P>
<P>
The department had counted on the increase from five to seven home games from 
last year would substantially increase revenues. But games such as Cal State 
Long Beach and New Mexico, each of which drew fewer than 14,000, have been 
little more than break-even propositions. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic department officials are hoping attendance for the BYU game will 
increase if it has a bearing on the Western Athletic Conference race and 
Holiday Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
But the lagging ticket sales are only part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The department is counting heavily on the AAF. In the budget for the fiscal 
year that began July 1, approved three weeks ago by the IAA, projected revenue 
from the AAF is $772,000. That is $348,000 more than received last year, an 
82.1% increase over 1988-89 fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials say that increased revenues from the annual fund-raising 
drive, its corporate sponsorship program and several planned special 
fund-raising events -- including a Nov. 21 tennis exhibition match at the San 
Diego Sports Arena between John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors -- will help the AFF 
meet its goal. But officials already have conceded privately that projected AFF 
revenue was over-budgeted by at least $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal crunch comes at time when the department is under pressure from the 
the office of W. Ann Reynolds, chancellor of the California State University 
and Colleges system, to operate a balanced budget. But at the same time, Miller 
has said he must put more money into women's athletics because concerns over 
inequities. 
</P>
<P>
There are some encouraging signs. Season ticket sales for basketball have 
already slightly exceeded last year's total, reaching 1,371 with 3 1/2 weeks 
until the first regular-season home game. But it would take more than a slight 
increase in basketball ticket sales to offset the football losses. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said the hope is that an increase in basketball revenue, combined with 
improved attendance the final two home football games, will cut the shortfall 
to a manageable level that could be eliminated with mid-year cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Because football and basketball account for the largest share of the department 
budget, it is those programs that likely would be trimmed the most, Erickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the maximum we have to cut out is $100,000," Erickson said. 
"We could probably peal that much away. It won't be done without some pain, but 
it could be done."

<P>
RAIDER GAME TO BE SHOWN ON LOCAL TV

<P>
For the first time in two years, the Chargers have sold out a home game without 
outside help. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Teele, the Chargers' director of administration, Wednesday declared a 
sellout for Sunday's game against the Raiders at 5 p.m. at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. As a result, the game will be shown locally both on ESPN (which 
is carrying it nationally) and Ch. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The blackout also was lifted a year ago for the Sunday night game against the 
Raiders, but only after ESPN, Ch. 10 and Cox Cable bought remaining tickets 
before the deadline (72 hours before kickoff). 
</P>
<P>
"We just have singles and a few pairs left, so it's essentially a sellout," 
Teele said. "We'll distribute over 59,000 tickets. Capacity is over 60,000 
(60,750), but the bleacher seats added after the baseball season don't count. 
Neither do the obstructed-view seats or the ones at the east end near the 
scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Chargers met the blackout deadline on their own was Nov. 29, 
1987, for a game against Denver. They also sold out the Raider game two weeks 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"Our win last week over a competitive team (the Philadelphia Eagles) and the 
Raiders' recent success have been key factors," Teele said. "And, of course, 
the rivalry with the Raiders. We've sold about 6,000 tickets since Sunday's 
game." 
</P>
<P>
The agent of quarterback Jim McMahon, Steve Zucker, didn't enhance his 
popularity in the Chargers' locker room with a remark he made last Sunday about 
their offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, Zucker probably cost himself a new client. 
</P>
<P>
After the Chargers' 20-17 victory over the Eagles, Zucker demeaned the men 
charged with protecting McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zucker: "I really think Jim's playing well, especially considering that 
line in front of him. I mean, look at it. You won't hear it from him, but how 
can you get anything done with that line?" 
</P>
<P>
When tackle Brett Miller read Zucker's words, he said, "He was interested in 
representing me, but after that comment, he can . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Miller added, "Agents are a bunch of leeches, anyway. The majority of them are. 
They milk you for what they can get and wait for the next guy." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Beightol, who coaches the offensive line in addition to serving as 
offensive coordinator, said, "(Zucker) doesn't know whether the ball is blown 
up or stuffed," 
</P>
<P>
Of the linemen he coaches, Beightol said, "They're getting better each week. 
They're not ready for the Hall of Fame, but I've never had a group work harder 
to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Sammy Seale is confident of avoiding a rerun of his disastrous 
season opener, in which Willie Gault burned him for four catches totaling 131 
yards and a touchdown in the Raiders' 40-14 victory at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do it by myself that day," Seale said. "I tried to be Superman, and 
I'm not Superman. I'm going in with a more realistic attitude this time." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
H-back Rod Bernstine is expected to miss his fifth game in a row because of a 
sprained knee. He didn't practice Wednesday, and Coach Dan Henning said, "I 
don't think there's a real good chance he'll play." He was listed as 
questionable on the Chargers' injury report for Sunday night's game against the 
Raiders. So were offensive tackle Brett Miller (knee) and defensive end Lee 
Williams (thigh), but Henning said they probably would play. . . . Running back 
Darrin Nelson (hamstring) was listed as probable, but Henning said, "If he goes 
hard tomorrow and pulls the muscle again, he'll be back in the same boat." . . 
. The Raiders listed quarterback Steve Beuerlein (neck) and linebacker Jerry 
Robinson (head) as questionable and safety Eddie Anderson (hamstring) and guard 
Steve Wisniewski (back) as probable. Regardless of whether Beuerlein is ready, 
Jay Schroeder will start.

HAMMOND TAKES FIRST-ROUND LEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Donnie Hammond, who has won $294,400 in his last three golf tournaments, shot 
an eight-under par 64 Wednesday for the first-round lead in the $650,000 
Kapalua International. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate was alone in second place at 67, followed by Nick Price at 68 on the 
6,761-yard Bay Course on Maui, where 48 professionals are vying for the 
$150,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond had eight birdies in his bogey-free round. Two of his birdies came 
after he landed in sand traps, one came on a 50-foot putt and another on a 
25-foot chip. 
</P>
<P>
"I played pretty solid," he understated. "It's nice to start out a tournament 
with a good round. It's nice to be in the driver's seat a little bit. I feel 
comfortable being in control." 
</P>
<P>
Light showers fell in the afternoon, but tradewinds were tame. 
</P>
<P>
In his three starts before this event, Hammond won the Texas Open, placed 
second in the Disney tournament and fifth in the Nabisco Championship. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Texas Open by seven shots with a score of 258, the second-lowest 
ever on the PGA Tour, topped only by Mike Souchak's 257 in 1955. In the Disney, 
a bogey on the final hole kept him from a playoff. His official earnings for 
the year are $458,741, good for 20th on the money list in his best season. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned a bad year into a real good year in just three weeks," said Hammond. 
"I've been working hard and I'm starting to get the breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, 32, joined the Tour in 1983 and has two career victories, the first 
being the Bob Hope Classic in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, 28, birdied four of the last 10 holes en route to his 67. The former UCLA 
star credited his short game for his success. 
</P>
<P>
"Chipping and putting, that's what it takes out here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pate knocked in birdie putts of one, five and four feet to offset a lone bogey 
over the first nine holes, and added birdie puts of one, 10 and 12 feet on the 
back nine. "The greens are the best I've seen them," Pate said. "The grain is 
still there, but not like it usually is. There are some putts that look pretty 
flat, but you can hit it 15 feet past. You get to learn where those fast putts 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Pate, who joined the Tour in 1985, played the same course last December in the 
Kirin Cup and shot 64. 
</P>
<P>
His best finish this year was a tie for third at the Honda tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Price bogeyed his last hole from six feet to fall out of a tie for second 
place, but wasn't unhappy with his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy," he said. "I just wanted to get it anywhere near 70. There are 
a lot of hot players here this week."

<P>
49ER, RAIDER VICTORIES REFLECTED HERITAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the better part of a century, it has often seemed that the more things 
change in football, the more they stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
In last weekend's games, for example, the Raiders and San Francisco 49ers 
crushed good opponents with offenses that were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Very different. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Basically true to the designs of their authors as plotted many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Former coach Bill Walsh, who created the 49er way, installed a short-pass 
offense that is still the marvel of the NFL. Awesome is one word for what 
quarterback Joe Montana did to the New Orleans Saints in a 31-13 game Monday 
night as the quarterback in the familiar Walsh system. 
</P>
<P>
Former coach Al Davis, creator of the Raider way, installed a wholly different 
kind of pass offense years earlier -- a more exciting one than Walsh's, 
actually, with an effective blend of long passes and power, as there was Sunday 
in the Raiders' 28-7 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
It was no fluke that quarterback Jay Schroeder's first bomb -- which wide 
receiver Willie Gault fielded more than 60 yards away -- preceded halfback Bo 
Jackson's 92-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' system, the only one in football that deliberately uses long-pass plays 
to set up power plays, hasn't changed greatly in his years as owner-manager. 
</P>
<P>
It reached a peak, however, against the team that represented the American 
Conference in the Super Bowl only last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati lost to two big passes to Gault and two powerful runs by Jackson, 
whose 92-yard score began as a power play launched between convoys of Raider 
blockers striking the left side of the Bengal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Art Shell has Davis' old job as coach of the Raiders. And in San 
Francisco, George Seifert has Walsh's old job. But on both teams, everything 
else is fundamentally the same. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that makes football so interesting is that there are so many ways to 
play it. 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame, Coach Lou Holtz wins with intricately timed option plays. At 
Florida State, Coach Bobby Bowden has a pass-oriented offense. The wishbone 
formation is still alive in some places. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers move on short passes, the Raiders on long. The Rams, who used to run 
their way into the playoffs with Eric Dickerson, have a much different look 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions are different kinds of run 'n' shoot 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for this variety is that football is a 22-man game whose 
offensive performers don't play defense. Thus offensive coaches have time to 
experiment with different schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that the players differ so greatly. A decade ago in San 
Francisco, Walsh, who had coached long-ball teams, running teams and others, 
found himself with a quarterback whose lack of arm strength dictated exactly 
what you see today from the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Davis is convinced that the surest way to win is with long 
passes and tough running plays. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Shell is facing something of a challenge in his first season as an 
NFL head coach. The player he calls his best all-around quarterback, Steve 
Beuerlein, doesn't have Schroeder's downfield passing range. 
</P>
<P>
How Shell solves this problem will be much more than a footnote to the '89 
Raider story. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ram game at Minneapolis last week, it was easy to see why Minnesota's 
critics have been offended this year by the offensive coaching of the Viking 
leader, Jerry Burns, and his deputy, Bob Schnelker. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Ram defense, the Vikings' close-in offense was consistently 
unimaginative and unsuccessful, as it has been for several years. 
</P>
<P>
On drive after drive, the Minnesota coaches gave their good players good plays 
to move the ball. But in scoring position they turned conservative, sending in 
simple running plays to set up field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Their seven field goals were a monument not to the artistry of the kicker -- 
who was seldom called on to kick the ball more than 25 yards -- but to the 
Vikings' undistinguished leadership. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best things the Rams have done this season was to hold their own 
with Minnesota, which, plainly, has the best players in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings were recruited by a knowledgeable general manager, Mike Lynn, who 
recently paid the price to bring in, among others, a Pro Bowl linebacker, Mike 
Merriweather, the former Steeler who earned the overtime safety that beat the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings put more Pro Bowlers on the field than any other team. It's hard to 
beat their receivers, Anthony Carter and Hassan Jones, or their defensive 
linemen -- particularly Keith Millard -- or the rest of their defense, 
particularly safety Joey Browner. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't hard to beat the Vikings. And their critics in Minneapolis and St. 
Paul think they know why. 
</P>
<P>
When the Green Bay Packers upset the Chicago Bears Sunday, 14-13, the NFL's 
instant replay officiating system did what it was designed to do. 
</P>
<P>
It made the right team win the game. The team that earned it got it. 
</P>
<P>
If there hadn't been an instant replay official on the job that afternoon, the 
Bears would have won, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
The officials on the ground had ruled that Packer quarterback Don Majkowski 
crossed the line of scrimmage before he threw the winning pass on fourth down 
with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"The game hinges on this play," replay official Bill Parkinson said. "So we 
took our time, and looked at (several TV versions). The ball did not cross the 
line of scrimmage (before Majkowski threw it)." 
</P>
<P>
Although many NFL club owners in recent years have voiced strong objections to 
continuing replay officiating -- which costs them a lot of money -- they may 
take a look at the Green Bay result and decide they need it after all. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the last 32 seconds of the Bear-Packer game could have 
happened to any of them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst fates in team sports is to lose on an official's erroneous 
call. It's still possible in most sports, but with instant replay it is less 
likely these days in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
There is one good reason why it would be disastrous for the NFL's owners to 
eliminate replay officiating now: they can't eliminate replays. Television will 
continue to show them as long as there is television. 
</P>
<P>
The only real question is whether or not the owners are willing to keep paying 
to end some of the most harmful mistakes made by their highly professional 
officials, who, 98% of the time, the tapes show, make the right call. 
</P>
<P>
Quote Dept.: 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning, San Diego coach, on quarterback Jim McMahon, whose leadership 
helped upset the Philadelphia Eagles on the day that McMahon's former team blew 
a big game in Green Bay: "The best thing he does (is) get rid of the ball 
without a sack. That allows you to go back for the next down without creating a 
(long-yardage) situation." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Noll, Pittsburgh coach, after quarterback John Elway -- despite 
considerable adverse publicity in Denver -- led the Broncos to a 34-7 victory: 
"They're a super team." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Banks, New York Giant linebacker, after the officials called three late 
hits against him, Lawrence Taylor and Adrian White in a game at Phoenix: 
"(Referee Howard Roe) said I cheap-shotted (quarterback Gary Hogeboom). He said 
I gave him a shot to the back. I never touched the guy. If I did, it was 
unintentional." 
</P>
<P>
Haywood Jeffires, Houston inside receiver, on the Oilers' four-wide receiver 
offense, which deploys Drew Hill and Earnest Givins outside and Curtis Duncan 
as the other inside receiver: "This might be the best foursome that has played 
in a long time. Most quarterbacks don't have the confidence to go to four 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rivera, Bear linebacker, on instant replay officiating: "It's basically 
taken human error, human effort and human nature out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Infante, Green Bay coach: "Who says the game has to have the human 
element at the officials' position?"

THE BIG GAME;

<P>
CITY EASTERN'S MAIN EVENT: POINT LOMA VS. MORSE

<P>
How simple it would have been if these two teams had just played at the 
beginning of the season and the county had then gotten on with the playoffs. 
Everybody has predicted all along that the City Eastern League football 
championship would be decided by today's 2:30 p.m. game between visiting Point 
Loma and Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, both Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens and Morse Coach John Shacklett 
said the typically cautious things coaches say at the start of a season. Such 
as: "There's a lot of games to play." And: "We just take one game at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Well, they played a lot of games and took them one at a time, and after all 
that, everything is the way it was supposed to be. Morse (7-2, 4-0) and Point 
Loma (6-3, 4-0) are tied for first. Today's game will decide the league 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, neither coach is willing to concede this was a two-team race. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Mira Mesa was tougher than we thought," Edens said. "We probably could 
have been beaten by them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shacklett, humbly: "I have to admit, I'm very pleased with the way things 
turned out." 
</P>
<P>
This figures to be quite a game if you consider that Point Loma and Morse each 
defeated the league's third-best team, Mira Mesa, by four points. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five meetings, each team has two victories and there has been one 
tie. Total score in those games? Morse 104, Point Loma 99. 
</P>
<P>
Stopping Point Loma quarterback Danny White and his receivers, J.J. Stokes and 
Brett Callan, would be Morse's ticket to victory. So far, no team has figured 
out just how to do that. White (126 for 208, 2,190 yards, 18 touchdowns) leads 
the county in passing, and Callan (51 catches, 936 yards, six touchdowns) and 
Stokes (47 catches, 984 yards, nine touchdowns) are first and second in 
receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Morse has a strong pass rush led by down lineman Irwin Mendiola, but Point 
Loma's offensive line is also strong and has given White ample time to throw. 
Morse will miss the services of tackle Salua Poutoa, who is out with a stress 
fracture in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Shacklett said his team showed its best balance offensively last week in a 
42-19 victory over Patrick Henry. Look for Morse quarterback Teddy Lawrence to 
run almost as much as he passes, and Utotofo Faime, a workhorse running back, 
to take the rest of the offensive responsibilities. Controlling the ball may be 
Morse's best defense against White, who can't throw from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Time for a prediction. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Edens? 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to bet my life on it, I'd bet on us," he said. "But I'm not out 
looking for bets."

TRAINER GETS EARLY WEDDING PRESENT

<P>
Four days before the big event, Victor Garcia collected a memorable wedding 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly, best known previously for having her number taken down after 
the 1988 Del Mar Debutante, rallied under Alex Solis to win the $81,225 Linda 
Vista Handicap Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of only a maiden victory at Caliente and an allowance win at Del Mar in 
13 previous starts, the 3-year-old Flying Paster filly overhauled favored 
Affirmed Classic in the final yards to win going away in 1:42 1/5 for the 1 1/6 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly's 6-1 upset provided the 25-year-old Garcia, the son of 
Caliente operator Juan Garcia, with his second Oak Tree stakes victory. Last 
year, he saddled Wait Till Monday to win the Henry P. Russell Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Given eight months off after finishing fourth in the Bay Meadows Oaks in 
January, Approved To Fly cruised in her sprint comeback, then ran second to 
Affirmed Classic in the Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
A trip to Kentucky proved fruitless. She never mounted a rally and wound up 
sixth, 13 lengths back of Winning Colors at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was kind of heavy and was favoring speed horses," said Garcia, who 
will wed Litta Parra Sunday in San Diego. "The horse had a little heat in the 
ankle when we turned her out, but it was nothing bad. 
</P>
<P>
"She's more experienced now. She was green before and used to lug in and out." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking her third consecutive victory for Ron McAnally since arriving in 
California, Affirmed Classic appeared to be home free a sixteenth out, but 
couldn't contain the winner. With Russell Baze sitting in for Jesus Castanon, 
still nursing a bruised shoulder after being dumped in a workout spill Sunday, 
she was nearly two lengths clear of stablemate Paper Princess. 
</P>
<P>
"I saved ground all the way to the quarter pole," said Solis, the rider when 
Approved To Fly was disqualified for bothering Lea Lucinda in the Debutante. 
"At the quarter pole, she got clear and in the last sixteenth I whipped her 
left-handed and she took off." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree Notes

<P>
In his third full day in Southern California, Gary Boulanger doubled Wednesday. 
The 21-year-old rider from Longacres in Washington won with 25-1 shot More 
Golden in the second and Only The Facts in the fourth. . . . There's a Pick Six 
carryover for today of $59,450. . . . Although she has only one stakes win, 
Approved To Fly has been second in four others. . . . Her Linda Vista victory 
was worth $47,475 to owners Barry and Judith Becker. . . . The Hillsborough 
Handicap from Bay Meadows will be simulcast locally Saturday.

BEUERLEIN LISTED AS QUESTIONABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Raider quarterback Steve Beuerlein practiced lightly Wednesday. The team is 
listing him as questionable for Sunday night's game in San Diego and holding 
out hope he'll be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said it's 100%, but I've got a shot," Beuerlein said. 
</P>
<P>
It's still considered a longshot. Beuerlein tore a ligament in his right knee 
11 days ago. Jay Schroeder, now the backup, was the quarterback in last week's 
victory over the Bengals and will start against the Chargers if Beuerlein 
can't. MARK HEISLER

MIGHTY MIRALESTE ALL-STARS START WATER POLO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Miraleste High water polo team opens the South Bay fall sports playoff 
season today, facing Western of Anaheim at home. The Ocean League champions are 
the No. 3 seed in the Southern Section 2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Miraleste starting lineup was named to an all-league team, and 
Marauder captain Kyle Hildebrand was the unanimous choice for Most Valuable 
Player. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, we dominated the league," Miraleste Coach Chick McIlroy 
said. "So it's a real challenge to keep everyone sharp." 
</P>
<P>
After beating Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks, 16-6, in a wild-card match Tuesday, 
Mira Costa moves into first-round 2-A playoff action today at Kennedy of La 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to play better than we did (against Notre Dame) to move 
through the playoffs," said Mira Costa Coach Mike Nollan, whose team advanced 
to last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (7-11), the surprise second-place finisher in the Ocean League, 
opens today at Agoura, the Frontier league champion. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (19-0), the nation's top-ranked girls volleyball team, enters the 
5-A playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the 16-team field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're deserving of the seed, and we're ready for the playoffs," Mira 
Costa Coach Dae Lea Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa opens today at 3 p.m. at home against Bishop Montgomery, which 
defeated Trabuco Hills in a wild-card match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prep League champion Chadwick (13-0) is the No. 1 seed in the Small Schools 
Division. The Dolphins play at home tonight against Thatcher in the opening 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery was a surprise winner at the Angelus League boys 
cross-country finals. The Knights, who suffered a regular-season loss to Mater 
Dei, edged the Monarchs by a point to earn their second straight CIF 
qualifying-meet appearance after a five-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
All divisional qualifying meets will be run Friday morning at Mt. San Antonio 
College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were just happy to go and we came in last in a 12-team heat," 
Bishop Montgomery Coach Tim Forney said. "This year we want to do well." 
</P>
<P>
Angelus League individual champion Joe Reinsch will lead the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Bishop Montgomery in the 4-A Division finals are Bay League champion 
Palos Verdes and runner-up Torrance, led by individual champ Israel Pose. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls 4-A finals, Palos Verdes is favored to win its fifth consecutive 
championship. "If we are healthy, (the 4-A championship) will be between us and 
Buena," Palos Verdes Coach Joe Kelly said. Kelly said some of his runners have 
flu, but top runners Tami Wilcox and Maya Muneno are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
In girls tennis, Miraleste and Palos Verdes seem destined to meet for a third 
time this year in the Southern Section 4-A semifinals. The teams split the two 
meetings by 11-7 scores. 
</P>
<P>
Both have to get through first-round and quarterfinal opponents, but Palos 
Verdes Coach Kathy Ross said the Nov. 16 semifinal date is tough to ignore. 
"It's tough not to look forward to Miraleste," she said. "Anything can happen, 
but I think we'll see them there." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (12-2) has not lost since early October at home to Miraleste. The 
Sea Kings' only other loss was to No. 1-seeded Corona Del Mar in the opening 
match of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Palos Verdes swept the Bay League singles and doubles championships. 
Sheila Moore was chosen Bay League singles most valuable player, and the 
doubles team of Paully Hackathorn and Lorren Lotesta was chosen doubles MVPs. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste (12-2) opens the playoffs today at home against Santa Monica, while 
Palos Verdes plays Dos Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick has played 15 matches without a loss this season and is the No. 1 seed 
in the 1-A division. The Dolphins open at home today against La Serna.

HARVARD ROLLS TO WATER POLO PLAYOFF WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Border and Eric Deutsch combined for 13 goals as Harvard High buried 
Newbury Park, 27-4, in a first-round Southern Section 3-A Division water polo 
playoff match Wednesday at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
The Saracens, who won the 2-A Division championship last season, led by as many 
as 16 goals early in the third period before Coach Rich Corso emptied his 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's the first step toward the championship," said Corso, whose 
team improved to 25-4, including a 12-0 Del Rey League mark. "We can win it 
all. I really believe it. The kids have got to keep on remaining positive and 
keep faith in the system." 
</P>
<P>
The Saracens were bumped up a division after winning the area's first water 
polo title in seven years last season, but they hardly have appeared 
overwhelmed by the improved competition. Harvard scored the game's first seven 
goals, and, after a Newbury Park (6-13) score early in the second period, 
rattled off the next 10 in a row. Newbury Park Coach Jack Doman was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
It was suggested, in jest, that perhaps the 3-A Division was better off without 
the fourth-seeded Saracens. 
</P>
<P>
"The 4-A can have them," Doman said. "Next year the 4-A, and the next year the 
world. It's an Olympic year, right? 
</P>
<P>
"You get out, count all your fingers and your toes, and if they're all there . 
. . I think they're No. 1, but we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard will next play Fontana, a 7-6 first-round winner over Indio, on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Wilkirson of Santa Ana Foothill High and Dorian Manigo of San Francisco 
Riordan signed national letters of intent with the Cal State Northridge men's 
basketball team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkirson, a 6-foot-5, 175-pound swingman, and Manigo, a 6-1, 160-pound point 
guard, signed on the first day of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
early-signing period. They will enroll at Northridge next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkirson averaged 17 points, nine rebounds and four assists a game as a junior 
and was named to the All-Century League team. Manigo averaged 16 points, four 
rebounds and five assists a game and was named to the All-Bay Area team. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo is the second Riordan player to sign with Northridge in the past year,

<P>
When the Chatsworth High girls' volleyball team fell behind early against 
Westchester on Wednesday, the Chancellors looked like anything but the 
top-seeded team in the City Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth trailed by six points in the first game before rallying for a 15-11, 
15-8, 15-7, quarterfinal win at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 8-2, in the first game, the Chancellors scored the next nine 
points, three on kills by middle blocker Lori Mertes, who led the team with 
nine. Daisy Sudparid had six service aces. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Kris Bassler had 27 assists for the Chancellors. Chatsworth plays El 
Camino Real on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. at Venice High. SCOT BUTWELL

ROYAL ADVANCES TO SHOWDOWN WITH EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devin Hurst scored five goals and cousin Todd Hurst added three to lead Royal 
High over Glendale, 11-6, in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A 
Division water polo playoffs Wednesday at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, who this season won their ninth consecutive Marmonte League 
title, advance to the second round for the eighth time in the past 10 years. 
Royal, however, has never won a second-round match and this year's opponent -- 
El Toro -- figures to be a worthy foe. The Chargers are the division's 
top-rated team. A coin flip today will determine the site of Friday's match. 
</P>
<P>
Against Glendale (10-10), which finished third in the Pacific League, Royal 
(15-6) got an inspired performance from junior William Spencer, who came off 
the bench to score two goals. He also had three steals and two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"He provided the spark," Royal Coach Steve Snyder said. "He got into the flow 
of the game very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 7, Costa Mesa 6 -- Crespi goalie Tim Behrens, making his first start 
after being sidelined with the chicken pox, recorded 15 saves as the Celts took 
a 7-5 lead in the fourth quarter and held on in the 3-A match at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Greco had three goals for Crespi (16-7), which never trailed. Jean Michel 
and Paul Suppa each scored twice for the Celts, who will play Palos Verdes on 
Friday. Palos Verdes defeated Fountain Valley, 11-9, on Wednesday.

MISS MANNERS: PESKY SUITORS NEED A GUILTLESS 'NO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN, Judith Martin is author of the new book Miss Manners' Guide 
for the Turn-of-the-Millennium (Pharos Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am a 39-year-old single professional, not currently 
dating anyone, and generally satisfied with my social life (or lack thereof). I 
work hard at a job I enjoy, keep up my own house and yard, and volunteer with 
several organizations. My free time, which is too little and very precious, is 
spent with friends and family, around my house, and doing all sorts of projects 
that give my life meaning. 
</P>
<P>
I don't enjoy casual dating for the sake of dating. Even though I would love to 
meet someone special, until I do I simply don't want to go out with a man just 
because he wants to go out with me. 
</P>
<P>
I recently experienced several awkward phone calls, during which a gentleman 
was unable (or unwilling) to take my hint that I was very busy. Now I have 
found myself again accepting an invitation because I don't know how to say no 
without sounding rude. 
</P>
<P>
Should I feel guilty when my friends chastise me for not giving the man a 
chance? What can I say to avoid unwanted dates, yet not insult the "suitor"? 
With the occasional egoist who plows unrelentingly on with invitations that are 
never accepted, do the standard rules of politeness apply? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Standard rules of politeness always apply, but the standard 
rule for ridding oneself of a pest is an insistently firm, "I'm so sorry, but I 
really can't," repeated as often as necessary. If you don't know how to say no, 
Miss Manners fears what the next step would be, after you accepted these or any 
other dates. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether you need feel guilty, certainly not. Miss Manners has always 
failed to understand why anyone would engage in such an unrewarding emotion. 
One's time is surely one's own to dispose of. 
</P>
<P>
If your friends really believe that you are offhandedly rejecting acquaintances 
you would value, they should invite you to visit them at the same time that 
such a candidate does. You would presumably spend a pleasant evening, because 
you at least enjoy their company, and you could judge, with more to go on than 
a telephone call from a stranger, if they were right. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- As a busy high-school teacher, I have little time to 
entertain. But a night-before-the-elections dinner seemed like an opportunity 
to invite some interesting guests. 
</P>
<P>
Three close friends were invited, plus one university professor and his wife, 
who had previously been guests in our home. They accepted. I also invited 
another professor from the same department, with the hope of becoming better 
acquainted with her; she seemed to be a fine and interesting person who would 
be a special sort of guest. She left a message on our answering machine 
requesting directions to our home. The final guest was to be a newcomer to the 
university, from a different department, who I thought would enjoy meeting the 
other guests. This guest also indicated an intention to come. 
</P>
<P>
The professor and his wife called at 4 on the afternoon of the party to say 
they would be unable to come (car trouble), and, oh yes, the other professor 
had a paper to write and wouldn't be coming either. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and the remaining guests were uncomfortable with the obvious 
overabundance of food, but we all put on a jolly face. Underneath that facade 
was my chagrin. Had I somehow been presumptuous in my invitation to senior 
academicians? 
</P>
<P>
If I wasn't in error, then the people from the university must be judged to be 
incredibly insensitive. I had so looked forward to a lovely party, and had 
spent a great deal of time and money preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- As you well know, these people were simply rude, and in a 
regrettably common fashion. Had they been snobbish, which is what you mean by 
raising the question of presumption on your part, they would not have accepted 
your invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Sudden death, preferably one's own, is the only legitimate excuse for throwing 
over a dinner party at the last minute. (Miss Manners trusts that you made it 
clear this was a dinner party, not simply a huge drop-in-if-you-can 
television-watching preelection party.)

* Five Acres (Boys' and Girls' Aid Society of Los Angeles) received a grant of 
$25,000 from proceeds raised at the sixth annual Teradata Invitational Golf 
Tournament July 24. The check was presented to Five Acres Board of Directors 
President Marge Wyatt at the group's October meeting by Sally Simonds, 
Ferdinand Fattorini and Jerry Modes. Proceeds will be used to continue work 
with abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
* The American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) announced a final campaign 
total for Against AIDS/Los Angeles, of $1.54 million. The Sept. 10 Butterfield 
&amp; Butterfield live and silent auctions raised $240,000. They were the 
culmination of the Los Angeles campaign that began last December with an 
exhibition of more than 200 art works. Half of the proceeds from the Los 
Angeles campaign were awarded to AIDS Project Los Angeles. Funds generated 
nationally have surpassed $5 million, making Art Against AIDS the most 
successful fund-raising effort for AIDS research, education and services. 
</P>
<P>
* The Friends of the Los Angeles Free Clinic, at the Oct. 15 kickoff "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's," announced the group will conduct its 13th annual dinner-roast on 
Dec. 1 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel to honor Budd Friedman, founder and 
co-owner of the Improvisation Cafe. A goal of $125,000 was pledged, although a

YOUR COINS: GRANDFATHER LEFT GOLDEN, BUT NOT RARE, LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My grandfather left me some gold coins. They are: an 1855 $3 in fine 
condition; 1853 (Type I) $1, very fine; 1854 (Type II) $1, very fine; 1908 
Indian $10, extra fine; 1908 $5, very fine; 1896 Liberty Head $20, Mint State 
60; and an 1895 Liberty Head $10, also MS-60. He obtained the gradings from a 
coin dealer. Can you please give me a ballpark figure as to what they are 
worth? I have been told that they are rare and getting rarer. -- D.E. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your grandfather has left you a nice legacy. But whoever told you that 
your coins are rare and getting rarer is wrong. Coins are minted to specific 
numbers, so it would take extremely low mintages for rarity to be a factor. In 
order for the coins to become rarer, existing pieces would have to be lost, 
destroyed or melted. 
</P>
<P>
Your lowest mintage piece is the 1855 $3, with 50,555 produced. Unfortunately, 
according to the grade you submitted, it's rather worn and worth about $300 if 
accurately graded. The 1853 $1 has a high mintage of more than 4 million and 
worth about $275. The 1908 $10 is worth about $400, depending upon whether it 
has the motto, "In God We Trust," on it. (The No Motto piece is worth more than 
the one with the motto.) 
</P>
<P>
The 1908 $5 has a mintage of more than 500,000 and is worth about $200; the 
1896 $20 was minted in both Philadelphia (no mint mark) and San Francisco (an S 
mint mark). Both mintages are high with Philadelphia having a slight edge in 
value. Figure about $450. The 1895 $10 has a mintage of 567,826 and is worth 
about $250. 
</P>
<P>
Before you sell, get other opinions on the grading and price quotes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have what I believe is a half crown dated 1839. On one side there is a 
coat of arms and the inscription "Brittanica Regina Fed Def," on the other the 
head of Queen Victoria and a partial inscription, "Victoria Dei." Does it have 
any significant worth? -- M.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: If your coin is in extra-fine condition, which is in the mid-range of 
circulated, it's worth about $15. If it has more wear, it's worth less than 
that; if it's barely worn or not worn at all, it's worth considerably more. It 
would have to be seen to be accurately graded and evaluated. Most coin dealers 
can do this. It's best to get more than one opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are any of these coins of any value? There's an 1853 $1 gold with an O mint 
mark, a silver $1 dated 1881 and a 5-cent piece dated 1883. -- B.K.G. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your 1853-O $1 is $1,560 and up. (The O, incidentally, stands for the New 
Orleans Mint.) The 1881 $1 is $7 and up and the 1883 nickel is $3 and up. All 
prices depend on condition. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have quite a few silver quarters dated 1964 and older. Is it possible that 
some of these could be worth more than others, based on their dates? If so, 
where would I find a list of the quarters that are worth more than the 75 cents 
to a dollar they commonly bring? Or must I depend on some coin shop proprietor 
to give me this information? -- W.D.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: There's nothing wrong with getting prices from coin dealers. Checking with 
more than one dealer is also a good idea, because prices can vary depending 
upon dealer needs and interest. But there's also nothing wrong with buying a 
coin price guide. There are many on the market, and it shouldn't be difficult 
to see if you have any of the better dates. Also, both Coin World and the 
Numismatic News, weekly coin publications, print price guides on a regular 
basis. Some dealers, in fact, will share their Coin Dealers Newsletter with 
you. It is commonly called the Gray Sheet and it is used as a guide in 
dealer-to-dealer transactions.

It probably took longer to play the earthquake-plagued World Series than it did 
to rush a medal commemorating the event into the hands of collectors. The medal 
(pictured) features the Oakland A's logo on the obverse and the "Battle of the 
Bay" logo on the reverse. The 1-ounce silver pieces have a limited mintage of 
25,000 and sell for $29.95 plus $3 for handling from the Chicagoland Processing 
Corp., which is licensed by Major League Baseball. To order, call (800) 
765-0123.

A three-day seminar on grading U.S. coins will be conducted by the American 
Numismatic Assn. in conjunction with the 1990 Winter Long Beach Numismatic

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: CREDIT CARD A TRUE LIMITED EDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am the holder of the first American Express credit card, issued in 
October, 1958. The card is made of paperboard, which was later replaced by 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
It is my understanding that a card of this nature is extremely rare and sought 
after by collectors. What is its fair market price? -- H.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The American Express card you hold was first issued on Oct. 1, 1958, 
according to American Express' archivist in New York, Stephen Crysko. It was 
purple with a red expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
Crysko said this card and others are in a historical display in the firm's 
executive offices in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Tunks of Houston, an expert in collectible credit cards, estimated that 
about 500,000 of these paperboard cards were issued, but that relatively few 
have survived. There is a good reason for its rarity. 
</P>
<P>
According to archivist Crysko, when American Express issued its next credit 
card, on April 30, 1959, it told its customers to cut up the paperboard card. 
The new card, violet in color, was the firm's first plastic credit card. 
</P>
<P>
Tunks said in a telephone interview that he believes the value of that first 
American Express card varies widely, depending on its condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware of at least a dozen in circulation," he said. But he added that 
there are "probably hundreds" in collectors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
As for price, Tunks said a few months ago he got a letter from an individual 
who was "willing to pay $750 for one in mint condition." 
</P>
<P>
But in reality, he said, that probably was an exception and that a more 
realistic price was in the $300 range. 
</P>
<P>
Tunks, 39, publishes a monthly newsletter, Credit Card Collector, which, he 
said, has about 200 subscribers, averages 16 pages and has an annual 
subscription price of $19.50 (address: 150 Hohldale, Houston, Tex. 77022). 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to estimate how many credit card collectors there are in this 
country, says Tunks, who put the number somewhere between 5,000 and 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Collectible credit cards generally fall into three categories, he said: bank 
cards (such as MasterCard and Visa); travel and entertainment cards (such as 
American Express, Diners Club and Carte Blanche), and single-purpose cards 
(such as those issued by gasoline companies and department stores). 
</P>
<P>
Tunks started his newsletter about 3 1/2 years ago. Collecting credit cards, he 
said, is "relatively new and was virtually unknown five years ago. Until I 
started my newsletter, with the exception of a few collectors, (expired credit 
cards) were regarded as junk." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, he said, the American Express card is one of the most popular 
collectible credit cards. But it wasn't the first multipurpose credit card to 
appear in this country. That honor, he said, belongs to Diners Club, which 
issued its first card in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Diners Club story, a businessman, Francis Xavier McNamara, was 
in a Manhattan restaurant that year and realized, at the end of his meal, that 
he had forgotten his wallet. That night, McNamara came up with the idea for a 
multipurpose charge card, which sparked a credit revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the credit card industry, Tunks said, small booklets were 
issued, featuring the credit card as part of the cover and containing several 
tissue-thin pages telling the consumer where the card could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Tunks said such a Diners Club wallet-sized package, printed in the 1950s, sold 
for $525 a year ago, one of the highest prices ever paid for a collectible 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, not many individuals have been attracted to this collectible. 
</P>
<P>
"People still laugh," he said, when he talks about collecting credit cards (he 
said he has about 800 assorted cards in his personal collection). "But people 
who are well informed don't laugh. It's a ground-floor opportunity" for 
collectors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are obvious, he continued. First, only a limited number are printed 
for a credit card company's customers. And second, credit card companies tell 
their customers to cut them up when they expire. 
</P>
<P>
"So you have a double rarity factor," he said. "They're the ideal collectible, 
truly a limited edition."

SHAKING THE FAMILY TREE: SEARCH FOR ROOTS CAN START AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'I want to compile my family tree -- how and where do I start?" The answer is 
so obvious it can be overlooked: Start with information and records you'll find 
at home and in the memory of your relatives. 
</P>
<P>
You will find some family records in baby books, Bibles, diaries and journals 
(ask your grandmother if she ever kept a diary or journal -- you might be 
surprised and discover a treasure no one ever thought to ask about), old family 
letters, passports, memorial cards, newspaper obituaries (often inserted 
between pages of Bibles), pictures and school records. 
</P>
<P>
Genealogical research, while enjoyable and fascinating, does require 
methodology. Just because it is fun, and you're doing it only for yourself, 
does not change the rules for success. 
</P>
<P>
You must have names, dates and places. You can't find information about your 
grandpa Pierson if you don't know his full name, birth or death dates and 
places he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Determine which records exist that can help you. Where are they located? How 
can you access them? 
</P>
<P>
Start by looking for information right under your nose -- in your own home, at 
your parents', grandma's, Uncle Irving's and Aunt Clare's. Talk to the oldest 
members of your family first. 
</P>
<P>
Living relatives can be a peculiar bunch, especially when you start asking 
questions about the family's history. Some will be delighted you are 
undertaking this project; others will have a negative attitude. Be diplomatic 
in your requests. 
</P>
<P>
After checking records you find at home or through your helpful relatives, the 
next place to go is to the records of the city or town where your families 
lived. There you will find information in church records, city directories, 
city and county histories, hospital records, mortuary/funeral home records, 
newspapers, cemeteries, obituaries and tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
Cemeteries may be church-owned, privately owned or owned by the city or county. 
Their records usually show the plot where someone is buried, who is buried in 
the plot, who owns the plot, and sometimes the cause of death (disease or 
accident). However, tombstones often have information not recorded in the 
cemetery records, and you may be surprised to find out who is buried next to 
whom. 
</P>
<P>
Next, tackle some county records -- these are usually found in the courthouse 
of the county seat. They may include: births and deaths, civil and criminal 
suits, deeds and mortgages, guardian and lunacy records, marriage licenses and 
certificates, soldiers and sailors' discharge papers, voting lists, wills and 
probate records. 
</P>
<P>
On the state level, records are frequently found in state archives, state 
libraries, bureaus of vital statistics and in public libraries. These may 
include birth and death records, censuses (federal and state), land records, 
military records, state agencies and state histories. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are federal records -- among which you will discover some 
military records, pension records, censuses and bounty land records. Federal 
records will be found in several repositories, but many are available at the 
National Archives in Washington, or in its regional field branches. 
</P>
<P>
Now you know the types of basic genealogical records available. Next you must 
learn where they are located and how you can access them. Then you'll need to 
analyze what you find and compile the vast amount of data that you will 
accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, I suggest you go to your local library and consult a "how-to" 
book on genealogical research. Next, join your local city/county genealogical 
society so you can meet others who also suffer from the incurable disease -- 
genealogy -- that you have contacted.

ERMA BOMBECK: GETTING A LINE ON UNREACHABLE SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erma Bombeck is on vacation for two weeks. This Best of Bombeck release 
originally appeared June 22, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, my son, who lives in another state, got an answering 
machine. At first I resented it. I knew as sure as God made little green apples 
the kid was lying in bed with the machine turned on, listening to me having an 
anxiety attack and loving it. 
</P>
<P>
But after awhile, the machine began to take on a human quality. It had such 
fine manners. It would say softly, "Hi, I'm not here right now, but if you 
would leave your name and your phone number, I'll get back to you as soon as I 
can. At the sound of the beep, you have 10 seconds. Have a good day now." My 
son never would have said that! 
</P>
<P>
Somehow I couldn't bring myself to say what I had called for. ("You bum! Is 
your arm broken? I have stretch marks around my knees and you don't have five 
minutes to talk to your mother!") So I ended up saying: "I know you're busy. I 
was just checking to see if you're alive. I hardly hurt at all today. You have 
a good day, too." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years, the machine and I continued to communicate on a regular 
basis. As I told my husband, "I've never had a relationship that was so 
satisfying. That little monkey is always there for me when I need it. You know 
how you call some people and the phone rings and rings? Not this one. Why, even 
our son used to brush me off. Someone was always honking a horn, or a buzzer 
was going off, or his car was being stolen as we spoke. But not the machine." 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas in '84 it actually played "Silent Night" for me, and before the 
beep it wished me a merry Christmas. It meant the world to me. It was such a 
sweet, simple thing to do. No whining about how the gift was in the mail or how 
the airlines were booked and he couldn't get home, just a sincere little 
electronic Christmas card. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day -- I think it was the spring of '85 -- I dialed the machine and 
heard it say, "You have reached 555-4455. I promise I'll return your call." 
(God, I love integrity!) "Got a little problem. The beep is broken, but if 
you'll just count to five and leave your name and number, I'll call you right 
back." 
</P>
<P>
You'd have thought my son would have had the decency to tell me the recorder 
was sick. I know him. He had probably abused it in some way, like dropping it 
from the stove or cutting off its current. You know how kids are. They think 
only of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
I called the recorder yesterday, and a voice said, "Yeah?" 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Who is this?" 
</P>
<P>
The voice said, "It's your son." (It had been three years since I had heard his 
voice.) "How's it goin'? Are you there, Mom?" 
</P>
<P>
I told him I was waiting for the beep. He said I just caught him on his way 
out. 
</P>
<P>
I called the recorder a little later. We had a nice chat.

BORN IN THE HIPPIE ERA, VALLEY CLINIC COMES OF AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PERRY, Perry is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1978 and Audrey Goldman needed a doctor. With a history of abnormal pap 
smears, she required medical attention every six months. But the former Los 
Angeles schoolteacher was temporarily broke and newly single. Although she held 
a master's degree in counseling, Goldman lacked the internship hours necessary 
for licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Her only option, she believed, was the Valley Free Clinic in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was truly out of the '60s," Goldman recalled. "Everything about it was 
laissez-faire. Everybody looked like a hippie, even the administrator. They had 
long hair and wore unhemmed jeans. You couldn't tell the clients from the 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impression as an upper-middle-class person was, 'Maybe I don't belong 
here.' But the minute I met the staff and saw how they took care of me, I 
realized looks were deceiving. Volunteers came rain or shine, even with poor 
working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
That clinic's original location, on Lankershim Boulevard, was neither heated 
nor air-conditioned. During wintertime, the staff often wore gloves and 
jackets. Smoking was permitted, and the waiting room was in disarray. 
</P>

"It was upstairs, without handicapped access," recalled Diane Chamberlain, the 
clinic's assistant director for the past five years. "You went up very dark 
stairs to the offices, which, no matter how many times they were painted, 
always looked dirty." 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed for both Goldman and the clinic. After her initial 
visit, Goldman received her counseling license by performing an internship for 
the clinic. Today, she is a therapist and director of programs for the Southern 
California chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
<P>
And she has long since paid the clinic back for services rendered, in donations 
as well as volunteer service. She even sits on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
What about the clinic? It has become a sophisticated center offering a range of 
services including free AIDS testing, legal assistance, general health care and 
counseling. Patients are received in a clean and warm office. 
</P>
<P>
Originally founded in 1970 as the North Hollywood Counseling Clinic, the 
project was the brainchild of a group of Valley College students, doctors and 
pharmacists who were motivated to form something in the San Fernando Valley 
akin to the newly established Los Angeles Free Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmacist Ira Freeman was there from the beginning. After noticing a flyer 
next to his North Hollywood pharmacy, and with a little soul-searching, he 
decided to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a more positive effect on society. This gave me an 
opportunity to serve people who were not being served by the establishment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after he saw the flyer, Freeman attended planning sessions and found 
himself elected to the first board of directors. At the time, services -- which 
consisted of counseling by volunteers -- were offered for free, although 
donations were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients were low-income or no-income people who were not part of the 
general population," said Freeman, who still volunteers once a week at the 
clinic's dispensary. "The impression we had was that these were people who 
wouldn't feel comfortable in a normal medical setting." 
</P>
<P>
But by 1975, an evolution was under way. The name changed to the Valley Free 
Clinic. Medical and optometric services were added, and the clinic became a 
training ground for interning therapists. State and federal funding for family 
planning allowed the clinic to begin paying its medical staff for the first 
time. (Chamberlain said paid physicians receive between $20 to $25 an hour for 
their work.) 
</P>
<P>
Grants also came from the Valley Mayors Fund for the Homeless, Arco, IBM, 
Lockheed, J. B. and Emily Van Nuys Charities, MCA Foundation, Greater Los 
Angeles Partnership for the Homeless, Rockwell Employees Club and the McDonnell 
Douglas Community Service Group. 
</P>
<P>
With the late '70s came a designated smoking section. The reception area was 
vacuumed. Trash was emptied. Magazine racks were straightened. A more 
professional look ensued. 
</P>
<P>
"I think as new people began to be hired, we were looking for those qualities," 
Goldman said. "Not only are they a warm, loving, giving spirit but are they 
credentialed; what value system do they have; do they value documenting and 
record-keeping and organizational skills?" 
</P>
<P>
By the time Ann Britt took over as executive director in 1983, the clinic was 
undergoing further transitions. The board took a hard look at the realities 
facing the health care and free clinic movements. A year later, the "free 
clinic" was dropped and the Valley Community Clinic was born. The reasons were 
twofold, Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
On a pragmatic level, being licensed by the California Department of Health 
Services as a community clinic enabled the facility to charge fees based on a 
sliding income scale. The second consideration was strictly for public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"What I was finding out, as I went out to chambers of commerce was that 
community clinic was more palatable than free clinic," Britt said. "Business 
people have a little bit of a hard time with" the concept of free. 
</P>
<P>
Drastic changes continued. In the beginning, board members were professionals 
in the health care field who did not necessarily have fund-raising ability. 
Little or no time was spent on publicity. In fact, Freeman recalled an early 
bike-a-thon in which only four riders participated. 
</P>
<P>
"And one of them was the president, who was popping his nitro in order to make 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, more than 170 people attended the clinic's recent fund-raiser, a 
dinner-dance held Oct. 6 at Universal Entertainment Center's Streets of the 
World. More than $20,000 was raised. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency -- a project aimed 
at revitalizing Lankershim Boulevard -- condemned the clinic's site and 
assisted with its relocation to Vineland Avenue. Along with the move came a 
cleaner look: fresh paint and crisp, black vinyl chairs. And Keith Richman, 
internist and businessman who is head of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Although he believes that the ideals of the board members are basically 
unchanged from those of the preceding members, "however idealistic I am, I have 
a fiduciary responsibility to keep the clinic open," he said. "If we're going 
to provide the care, we've got to be able to pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
According to Chamberlain, funding from private companies can be difficult. For 
certain services, such as optometry, there's no problem. But for others, like 
birth control, difficulties arise. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with women's health care is that family planning is linked to 
abortion, even though it's a totally separate issue. We don't do surgeries 
here," she said, adding that when a pregnancy is diagnosed, clinic personnel 
only discuss options with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Counseling grants are also tougher to obtain, she explained, because the net 
result isn't concrete. (The clinic operates on a $650,000 annual budget, which 
does not include about $220,000 worth of volunteer time.) 
</P>
<P>
One thing hasn't changed, however. It's the clinic's neighbor-helping-neighbor 
policy. Even though there aren't geographical restrictions, half the clientele 
and almost the entire volunteer staff come from North Hollywood, Burbank and 
Van Nuys areas, Chamberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two percent of the patients are minorities, primarily Hispanic. And 
because one in five Californians under 65 has no health insurance and since 
access to health care has become increasingly difficult during the past decade, 
the clinic has seen patient visits increase from 750 per month in 1986 to 1,400 
to 1,500 per month at the new facility, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our patients start coming here because they have no funds to go 
anywhere else," said Lillian Finck, a 71-year-old volunteer who has worked in 
the clinic's lab for 10 years. "Some of them go on to get jobs, and they still 
come here because they like the care. They like the fact that everybody's 
interested in them as a person." 
</P>
<P>
"We always make an effort to call people by name, and we use first names only," 
Chamberlain said. "We want people to feel like they have an opportunity to ask 
their questions. We make sure people don't leave confused." 
</P>
<P>
Today, patients are pretty much the same as in the past -- teen-agers, 
low-income and unemployed men and women, the elderly, the homeless, 
schoolchildren who take advantage of the partially city-funded optometry 
program, and whole families in need of counseling. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical Tuesday evening, around the dinner hour, patients and staff 
members begin arriving. (Services are by appointment only -- day and evening -- 
which is the practice at most free and community clinics, Chamberlain said.) 
</P>
<P>
It's business as usual. Medical residents perform routine pap smears, examining 
women for infections and providing family planning information. In the lab, 
blood work is processed. The pharmacy dispenses medication. A lawyer offers 
advice on a landlord-tenant dispute. Several others are in need of information 
about restraining orders against an abusive former spouse. 
</P>
<P>
It's on these busy days when there is standing-room only that Chamberlain feels 
a sense of comfort and pride. 
</P>
<P>
She smiles. "We're just helping people function."

RIGHT-WING ORTHODOX JEWS FIND VOICE IN RABBI AHARONI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA RIFKIN, Rifkin is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Dov Aharoni is a man of paradoxes. 
</P>
<P>
He rails against what he calls the spiritual emptiness of suburban American 
Jewish life, yet lives comfortably in one of the nation's pre-eminent suburban 
communities, the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He is a ferocious supporter of Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, but admits that the greatest disappointment of his life was his 
unsuccessful attempt to adapt to living in a West Bank settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And although he counts himself among that generation of Americans who came of 
age in the free-thinking 1960s and '70s, his radicalization left him rooted 
even deeper in the authoritarian Orthodox Judaism of his upbringing. Rather 
than burn his draft card, Aharoni's days of rage were played out on the streets 
of his native Brooklyn in support of the militant Jewish Defense League. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni arrived in Los Angeles just three years ago, but already his ability to 
turn a phrase and his willingness to take the heat for controversial positions 
has made him the media darling of Los Angeles' growing Orthodox Jewish 
community. The city is home to between 60,000 and 80,000 Orthodox Jews, the 
second-largest concentration in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's essays -- often strident, uncompromising and sardonic -- are 
published regularly in the city's Jewish English-language newspapers, as well 
as on the opinion pages of The Times and other publications, extending his 
influence far beyond his small Woodland Hills synagogue, Beit Hamidrash 
Congregation. Articulate as well as literary, he is also a fixture on the local 
Jewish lecture and debate circuit, his views always to the right of his fellow 
panelists. 
</P>
<P>
These views run the range of Jewish religious and political issues. "He seems 
to be able to take a position on everything," said Rabbi Jack Simcha Cohen, 
president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni has lambasted the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles for 
earmarking charity dollars for a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood in Israel 
rather than spending it at home on purely Jewish institutions. He routinely 
castigates Conservative and Reform rabbis for their less-stringent standards 
for conversion to Judaism, accusing them of turning the process into a 
money-making endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
He has written disapprovingly of Jewish teen-agers socializing with non-Jews, 
saying it might lead to intermarriage, and he has berated Jews for caring more 
about the homeless and other social concerns involving non-Jews than they do 
about strictly Jewish needs, such as the religious education of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, also Orthodox, said Aharoni is the first visible spokesman of the Jewish 
right-wing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he the spokesman for orthodoxy?" Cohen asked. "No. But there are quite a 
number of people in the Orthodox community who are very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
"Influencing the public is the name of the game," added Rabbi Alan Kalinsky, 
West Coast director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. "A good 
number of us in the community encourage him to publish as often as he can 
because we don't have anyone else who is willing to say it like he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is enamored with Aharoni. Reform Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin of Bel-Air's 
Stephen S. Wise Temple calls Aharoni "knowledgeable, even if I don't agree with 
him on many issues." Zeldin noted that the vast majority of the 600,000 or so 
Jews in the Los Angeles area are Reform, Conservative or secular and "would 
find most of what Rabbi Aharoni says to be anathema." 
</P>
<P>
One Orthodox critic of Aharoni is Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, the highly 
liberal (by Orthodox standards) Hillel Council campus rabbi at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be knowledgeable, but his views on Israeli politics fly in the face of 
Jewish morality," Seidler-Feller said. "Unfortunately I think he reflects the 
views of a growing number of people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni, boyish-looking at 36, clearly relishes all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional orthodoxy was defensive about its views, but I see no value in 
playing the isolationist and tending to my small flock of followers," he said. 
"I believe in going on the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni insists that he has tempered his tongue considerably since his angry 
college years when he wrote his first book, "Jews for Nothing." In that volume, 
he charged that institutional Christian anti-Semitism is still a dangerous 
reality. Non-Orthodox, suburban American Judaism, he wrote, is a sterile 
religion of "nursing-home owners" that "extols the paganistic bar mitzvah . . . 
a religion of shameful Portnoys, bagels and sonorous ministers." 
</P>
<P>
"Ideologically, I haven't changed one iota," Aharoni said during a recent 
interview in his Woodland Hills home. "But I've mellowed out tremendously. I 
don't use the same terminology now as I once did." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that from an Orthodox perspective, he is a centrist on many 
theological issues. Unlike most ultra-Orthodox rabbis, he allows women to 
attend his religious studies classes and does not shun the non-observant. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni came to Los Angeles following two frustrating years in Israel. He and 
his family moved into a new West Bank Jewish settlement with the intention of 
never leaving. He even adopted a new name, dropping the family name Fisch in 
favor of the Israeli-sounding Aharoni. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Israel with the greatest of ideals," he said. "My commitment to 
aliyah (settling permanently in Israel) was as much as anything my reason for 
becoming a rabbi. And then I got there and one by one I saw my dreams turn to 
puffs of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
In his writing, Aharoni blames his disenchantment with Israel on that nation's 
struggling, socialist-driven economy and overbearing bureaucracy. In 
conversation, however, he admits that his failure to adjust also stemmed in 
large part from his fondness for middle-class American life. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't realize how much we had come to love our American life style," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's return to the United States was facilitated by a sister who lives in 
Tarzana and put him in touch with Beit Hamidrash Congregation, a struggling 
Orthodox outpost that needed a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, he's fit in like a glove," said Alan Shapiro, Beit Hamidrash's board 
president. "His being so public hasn't hurt either. He arouses people's 
curiosity and that brings them to our synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
In Aharoni, the synagogue secured a dynamic leader with a growing reputation. 
He has written two books (his second book was a defense of Israel's 
controversial Gen. Ariel Sharon) and served as national executive director of 
Herut Zionists of America and as a right-hand man in New York to Rabbi Meir 
Kahane, the JDL founder who advocates the forcible expulsion of Arabs from 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni, meanwhile, took over a congregation comprised of mostly like-minded 
souls (the Los Angeles leader of Kahane's overseas support organization is a 
member). One-third of the congregation is made up of expatriate Israelis, while 
many others are Americans who also tried life in Israel but returned to the 
United States. Ninety percent of the congregation is ba'alei teshuvah, formerly 
non-observant Jews who have recently become Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
Under Aharoni, Beit Hamidrash has more than doubled its membership to about 60 
families. Its day school, the West Valley Hebrew Institute, has about 40 
youngsters in the first three grades. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation recently won city approval to move to a larger location in 
Woodland Hills, a converted home on Fallbrook Avenue, and it attracted more 
than 300 people to Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services held in an apartment 
complex meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni said the congregation is in the process of changing its name to 
Woodland Hills Synagogue. "I want a name that is more compatible with the West 
Valley," he said. "This is not Fairfax. This is the Valley, and out here most 
Jews can't even pronounce Beit Hamidrash, no less look it up in the phone 
book."

PROBLEMS BEGIN EARLY FOR LIKELY DROPOUTS

Although each case is different, educational experts say many junior high 
school dropouts have experienced emotional or academic problems long before 
they reach the point of giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, a lot of them have dropped out as far back as third or fourth 
grade," said Jewell Henderson, a Los Angeles Unified School District adviser. 
"Teachers are even beginning to identify children in kindergarten who could be 
potential dropouts." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lenkeit, director of the Institute for Motivational Development's Los 
Angeles office, said many parents who bring their underachieving children in 
for counseling report that there have been problems for at least two to five 
years. "The parents think the problems will disappear if they wait it out," he 
said. "But usually they just get worse over time." 
</P>
<P>
What can parents do to help their children? Educators and counselors offer the 
following advice: 
</P>
<P>
* Communicate with teachers. A child who regularly doesn't want to go to school 
may be experiencing problems that could be easily corrected if educators were 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it can be as simple as changing a child's seat, or finding out that 
another child is being mean on the playground," Henderson said. "Parents need 
to find out why a child doesn't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
* Seek out educational resources where needed. Experts say a young child who is 
falling behind scholastically often develops self-esteem problems, which in 
turn can lead to further academic difficulties. Parents can request tutors or 
resource specialists in the public schools to assist their children to catch 
up. School psychologists can provide free counseling when needed. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask children about any difficulties they may be having. Statistics show that 
most junior high school dropouts experience problems early in seventh grade, a 
time when they are faced with a new level of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"They're starting puberty, there are a lot of social issues coming up for them, 
and on top of that they also have to learn how to handle their time better with 
changing classes and more teachers," Lenkeit said. "Some of them need help with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
* Get involved. "Schools can offer a lot of resources, but they can't take the 
place of parents," said Charles Esplain, director of counseling and guidance 
services for the Los Angeles district. "If parents don't take the time to find 
out what's going on with their child, that sends a powerful message. If they 
want their child to care about school, they have to care too." AURORA MACKEY

Photo, A Bard Who Turns Yon Young Yawns Into Yuks The lights dimmed. The kids 
hooted, hollered and whistled. And then 350 students from peninsula high 
schools settled down to a special performance of Shakespearean tragedies that 
draws as much from Saturday morning cartoons as from the Bard. In only an hour, 
the Reduced Shakespeare Company performed three versions of "Hamlet" -- one of 
them backward -- and a fast version of "Romeo and Juliet." Actors in period 
costumes and high-top sneakers, such as (from left, above) Daniel Singer, Jess 
Borgeson and Adam Long, sped through select scenes from the plays, spicing them 
with unexpected humorous twists. Juliet, played by a man, performed the balcony 
scene from atop the shoulders of another performer, and Romeo (right, Singer 
again) kissed a member of the audience instead of his beloved's very puckered 
lips. In "Hamlet," the play-within-a-play was performed by hand puppets. The 
Hollywood-based company has been performing fast, fanciful versions of the two 
tragedies since 1981 and also a two-hour performance called "The Complete Works 
of William Shakespeare (Abridged)." Last week's performance at the Norris 
Theatre drew a standing ovation from the teen-agers, who pronounced the 
tragedies "fun." ALAN HAGMAN / Los Angeles Times

LITTLE TRAMP IN A TOUGHER WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
The emergence of original, outstanding directing talent is always exciting. 
It's a hint that film may get a transfusion of lifeblood richer than the anemic 
reconstituted stuff trickling in from Movie of the Week directors or sleek MTV 
stylists. 
</P>
<P>
Authentic talents make their mark from the first: Spike Lee was someone to 
watch after "Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads," as is Terence Davies 
after "Distant Voices, Still Lives." Jim Sheridan, of "My Left Foot," is 
clearly a writer-director of intelligence and bracing unsentimentality and Jane 
Campion -- whose stunner, "Sweetie," will be here before long -- has a pure, 
distinctive vision. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the magical "Sidewalk Stories" (opening Friday at the AMC Century 
14), we can add Charles Lane, who has had the audacity to make a 
black-and-white silent movie and make it, in the face of today's shamelessly 
callous values, with a brimming heart and an activist's outraged passion. 
</P>
<P>
Lane, the film's producer, writer, director, co-editor and central figure, 
plays a character Chaplin would recognize. Called only the Artist, he's a 
bashful, ingenious Greenwich Village street portraitist, scuffling to get by in 
the breath-defining New York winter. 
</P>
<P>
The physically small Lane is part of a collection of street performers -- 
tap-dancers, jugglers, three-card monte dealers -- who seem to dwarf him, 
particularly his bullying rival (Tom Hoover) who might have migrated in from a 
basketball team. In true silent-movie fashion, the Artist isn't above a bit of 
sly retaliation, taking a blowtorch to his competitor's sketchpad. 
</P>
<P>
But in the way Hoover towers over Lane, the city looms over them all, bleak, 
frightening and bitingly cold. That is the demarcation between "Sidewalk 
Stories," which cares intensely about its street people and their homeless 
neighbors, and Chaplin, who used little tramps and hobos as stylized, 
sentimental figures. There is no shortage of emotion here or sentiment either, 
but it's built on harsher bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, the unfettered Lane finds himself in charge of an adorable 
2-year-old (Nicole Alysia), wrested out of the care of both parents. He puts 
her up at his digs, the last remains of a demolished building that he has 
jerry-rigged to have lights, although it's without heat or a mattress. Lane's 
character isn't supposed to be able to resist the big-eyed, pony-tailed Alysia; 
it would be surprising if anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
As he searches for the toddler's mother, Lane re-meets a warm, magically 
unattached baby-store owner (Sandye Wilson), whom, in a delicately charged 
scene, he has once sketched. She is also astonishingly compassionate for a New 
Yorker; watching him shoplift clothes for his little charge, she pretends not 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
Lane is a master at fending for himself, but like someone seeing the city from 
wheelchair height for the first time, he suddenly begins to see his 
surroundings from a 2-year-old's precarious point of view. Pushing a stroller, 
he can no longer dart across red lights. Picking a bathroom door in a 
restaurant becomes a dicey choice. Just how fierce can he get with sandbox 
bullies -- and their mink-coated mothers? 
</P>
<P>
Lane relies entirely on mime and Marc Marder's buoyant, brilliantly scored 
music to carry his story points -- he even scorns intertitles. Marder is a 
wonderful choice: He has themes here as memorable as some that Chaplin did for 
his "Limelight" score. And Bill Dill, the cinematographer, creates equal 
atmosphere and presence with his rich black-and-white camera work. 
</P>
<P>
However, not all of his cast have Lane's delicate control of silent 
storytelling; the picture occasionally wobbles when its mimes are less expert 
or when the plot gets a little too far-fetched, as in its taxi-kidnap incident. 
</P>
<P>
About its equally unlikely love story you may feel more tender, since Wilson is 
so glowingly readable and real. Nice to think that this cross-class attraction 
would hold, even when experience suggests otherwise. Lane even creates a dream 
love scene that might have popped out of "She's Gotta Have It," one that 
Chaplin's buttoned-up Tramp would never have allowed himself. (It's Lane's 
moment of quick nudity that gives the film its unfortunate R-rating.) 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is pushed to shelter these two when Lane comes back to find his 
makeshift flat bulldozed and everything inside ruined. Now he doesn't even have 
the luxury of a stroller, and the reality of life with a child during the harsh 
winter is awful. They try missions, but those fill up on the worst nights. 
Lane's stated intention -- that no one look at the homeless in quite the same 
way after his film -- may be realized more acutely after this gentle fable than 
after more hard-edged portraits, simply because his characters are so tenderly 
drawn and his touch is, for the most part, so tactful and restrained. 
</P>
<P>
All the more reason to feel that Lane has underestimated his power in his 
film's very last scenes, when he shifts techniques abruptly and allows his 
homeless to speak. It's clearly a mistake that comes from the heart and from 
inexperience, but he should have trusted the enormous bond he had created with 
us and kept his final eloquent plea within his own stylistic constraints. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mistake, not a disaster. "Sidewalk Stories" is a bold and utterly 
enchanting creation, and its appearance is a signal to watch the multifaceted 
Lane closely. Whatever happens next cannot be commonplace.

'thirtysomething' Gets Calls: David Marshall Grant and Peter Frechette slipped 
between the sheets on Tuesday night's episode of ABC's "thirtysomething," and 
Wednesday morning the ABC switchboard was busy answering the phones as a 
result. By midmorning, one operator (of three taking calls) had logged 25 
calls, 23 of which were offended by the post-bed scene between the two men. 
"thirtysomething's" Emmy-winning executive producer Marshall Herskovitz's own 
response Wednesday: "We didn't do it for fun. It was a natural following-out of 
themes we had established. I don't know if the relationship between the 
characters will continue; that hasn't been decided. But we're not waiting for 
public response to influence our decision. We've never worked that way, and 
we're not going to start now." Incidentally, this was not the first time the 
two actors had played a homosexual couple. Two years ago, Grant and Frechette 
co-starred as gays interned in Dachau in the acclaimed drama "Bent" at the 
Coast Playhouse -- for which Frechette won a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle 
Award. ALEENE MacMINN

Accord Reached in Opera Strike: A tentative agreement was announced Wednesday 
in the eight-week musicians strike that canceled the New York City Opera's fall 
season. Terms of the agreement reached late Tuesday were withheld pending a 
ratification vote, probably this weekend. The strike began Sept. 13, which was 
to have been opening night of a 70-performance season. After making progress in 
negotiations last week, the company announced that it was going ahead with 
plans for its spring season of musicals. The opera's 69 orchestra members went 
on strike over wages and the number of guaranteed weeks of work per year.ALEENE

STAGE WATCH: TAPER MAKES MOVE FOR HARTFORD'S 'PEER GYNT'; NEW DIRECTORS TO LEAD 
REVAMPED 'FORMICANS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement that Kenneth Branagh's London-based Renaissance Theatre 
Company will bring "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in repertory to 
the Mark Taper Forum has the trappings of a terrific opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
True, the Jan. 21-March 4 bill replaces Tom Stoppard's "Artist Descending a 
Staircase" (which will now descend on Broadway), but it is more than a schedule 
replacement. Not only was this collaboration the result of uncanny timing 
(coinciding schedule cancellations for both companies made coming together 
possible), but there was -- is -- the suggestion this could become a 
stimulating and ongoing association between the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
It might even culminate -- the matter came up -- in a mixed company of British 
and American actors. However, that's far in the future. For now, the 
boyish-looking Branagh, 28, and his brash 2-year-old RTC resemble nothing so 
much as youthful catalysts for the 25-year-old Taper. 
</P>
<P>
Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson doesn't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any promises or pretense about the future," he cautioned 
Tuesday after the announcement. "This is not a substitute for the work we need 
and want to do. But it's a viable alternative in terms of seeing the classics. 
And it's affordable from our standpoint, which is important." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not as affordable but certainly as exciting is the news that Davidson 
is also talking with Mark Lamos, artistic director of Connecticut's Hartford 
Stage, about the possibility of restaging the Hartford's impressive and 
much-acclaimed two-part "Peer Gynt" at the Taper next season. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Thomas, who earned personal accolades in the title role at Hartford 
earlier this year, would repeat it at the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in the context of theaters exchanging projects and personnel," 
Davidson said, pointing to the Taper's "Stand-Up Tragedy" now playing at 
Hartford. Underscoring his affection for such cross-pollination, he cited Taper 
associations with New York's Circle Rep, London's Royal Court, South Africa's 
Market Street Theatre and now, of course, the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the theater bigger than the sum of its parts," he said. "Mark (Lamos) 
is anxious to take a second look at his work. And Richard (Thomas) would like 
another crack at a complex part." 
</P>
<P>
But it's a massive undertaking and practical considerations could get in the 
way. "The two theaters are similar, but also different," Davidson said. "They 
have a fly gallery and big storage backstage. We don't. Mark and I had talked 
about this earlier, but (a couple of weeks ago) was the first time we took a 
look at the logistics." 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
THE MATRIX SHUFFLE: The opening of Constance Congdon's "Tales of the Lost 
Formicans" has been postponed twice at the Matrix Theatre. It now opens Sunday 
with new directors: Lee Shallat and Kristoffer Siegel Tabori replacing Michael 
Arabian. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't see eye to eye," said producer Joe Stern. "I didn't recognize 
that until I saw that (the play) was turning into a sound-and-light show. We 
set out to do a season about words, two chairs and a table, and we almost got 
into an event." 
</P>
<P>
Arabian agrees that his differences with Stern were purely artistic, "but they 
should not have been," he said. "When Joe invited me to join the company, he 
said he wanted me to do something more experimental, more conceptual for him, 
because he had never had that experience as a producer. 
</P>
<P>
"I delivered what he said he wanted, and I think because of his inexperience 
with this type of theater he didn't understand what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Arabian will be staging three one-acts in March for the Taper's '50s-'60s Rep: 
Pinter's "A Slight Ache," Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" and Albee's "The 
Sandbox." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Dueling Divas," an evening of song starring Amanda McBroom and Mara 
Getz as a benefit for the Matrix, will take place there Monday, 8 p.m. 
Tax-deductible tickets are $75-$125. 
</P>
<P>
NOT YET A NON-THEATER: When Tom Stagen of Stagen Realty and Management Inc., 
owner of the Wilshire Theatre, decided he wanted the Nederlander Organization 
out of there and his firm out of the 34-year lease it had with the 
Nederlanders, he didn't count on having to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the sporadic bookings at the 1,988-seat house on Wilshire 
Boulevard near La Cienega Boulevard, he sued the Nederlanders in 1986 for 
breach-of-lease. But in an out-of-court settlement earlier this year, it was 
Stagen who ended up having to buy his way out. What price freedom? $1 million. 
The deadline: September. Stagen asked for an extension through Oct. 30 to buy 
time to drum up the cash. 
</P>
<P>
However, Oct. 30 came and went "and we're still in possession of the theater," 
said Nederlander vice president Stan Seiden. 
</P>
<P>
"Stagen told Jimmy (Nederlander) he didn't have the money at this time, so we 
find ourselves starting from ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
"It's correct," Stagen confirmed. "We're a bit behind schedule. We haven't 
consummated the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he know when the deal might be consummated. "I'll let you know as soon 
as I do." 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander attorney Neil Papiano explained the legal ramifications: "It means 
(Stagen) has forfeited his earnest money ($25,000) and we've been damaged in 
our ability to book the theater, since we assumed he was taking it over. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect," he added, "that we will take some legal action." 
</P>
<P>
It's not over till it's over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERY SERIES III: The Pasadena Playhouse's Monday-night Discovery Series 
enters its third year Monday at 8 with a reading of "The Return of Jeeves," a 
P. G. Wodehouse novel adapted by Jim Piddock. Piddock, Kate Burton, Clive 
Revill, Dana Ivey and Alan Mandell (as Jeeves) constitute the cast. 
</P>
<P>
Playhouse artistic director Susan Dietz has found this a productive source of 
new plays, personally and in general. Vince McKewin's "Ad Wars," read last 
spring, she said, will be part of the Playhouse's next Mainstage season. Jim 
Brochu's "The Lucky O'Learys," read in June, is becoming a feature film.

CHEESECAKE: RICH INDULGENCES; 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE DECADENT AND GUILT- LADEN. BUT IN SPITE OF THE HIGH-FAT, HIGH-CALORIE 
CONTENT, MOST OF US FIND IT HARD TO RESIST A GOOD CHEESE- CAKE. THESE RICH AND 
WONDERFUL DO-AHEAD SWEETS MAKE GREAT HOLIDAY DESSERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BALSLEY, TIMES FOOD EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheesecakes are a built-in guilt trip. Loaded with fat and all the other 
no-no's a modern diet decrees be eliminated, cheesecakes are nonetheless almost 
the irresistible dessert. Truthfully, it should be illegal for anything to 
taste as good as a well-designed cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
Don't try to fool yourself into thinking that just a thin slice won't be too 
fattening. It's a fact of life: A REAL cheesecake, one filled with all those 
wonderful rich ingredients that make up its smooth and creamy texture and 
flavor, is loaded with calories. 
</P>
<P>
Take that Italian masterpiece, the Neopolitan pastiera, a cheesecake/tart 
usually served around Easter. It is a mixture of softened wheat berries, 
ricotta, fruits, eggs and flavorings. The ingredients are mostly healthful, 
with just a few that could add up to a bit of trouble for someone watching 
their cholesterol and fat intake. After all, ricotta cheese certainly isn't 
anywhere near as fattening as the cream cheese usually used in cheesecakes. And 
just think of all that highly desirable fiber provided by the wheat berries. 
</P>
<P>
So a good pastiera should be the perfect answer for the person looking for a 
low-calorie cheesecake, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong! It may be lower in calories and fat than many of the ultrarich 
cheesecakes that abound in top-drawer restaurants or are made from secret 
family recipes that have withstood the test of time, but it is still a totally 
decadent indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just how one should view a cheesecake -- as a rich indulgence. One 
that is either worth the guilt trip it causes, or isn't. The decision is yours. 
But if you're going to sample one of these creamy desserts, enjoy it. Put your 
conscience in your pocket, savor every bite and make up for your lapse of 
fortitude the next day. 
</P>
<P>
With the holidays soon to be upon us, a cheesecake can be a good choice for a 
festive dessert. They have that one looked-for attribute that every frantic 
cook needs; they can, indeed must, be made ahead. And by and large, most 
cheesecakes go together quickly and easily. 
</P>
<P>
One exception to this rule is a very special pastiera from La Mela, a small 
storefront-type restaurant on Mulberry Street in the Little Italy section of 
New York City. Nancy Zaslavsky, a Los Angeles-based graphics designer, talked 
about La Mela at a dinner party one night and urged me to pay it a visit the 
next time I was in New York. So I did, and quickly discovered that the moment 
you finally get a table in the place you can forget about ordering what you 
want. Mimmo or Pepi, both ebullient hosts, immediately take you in hand and 
bring you what they think you need. It sounds dicey, I know, but the meals I've 
had there and those served to equally startled diners at tables near us each 
time were wonderful examples of good, simple Neopolitan food. 
</P>
<P>
The pastiera was memorable and Pepi gladly shared the recipe. Unfortunately one 
of the ingredients turned out to be a major problem. Pepi's recipe called for 
"grain wheat," which we finally discovered is really whole wheat berries. But 
ordinary wheat berries really don't produce a satisfactory end result. Finally, 
we got the answer to our problem from two excellent sources. Albert Vera of 
Sorrento, a well-known Italian deli on Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, told 
us he carries what we needed under the name "peeled wheat grain." Sorrento has 
the product most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Still another source, Carlo Middione, in his book "The Food of Southern Italy" 
(William Morrow, $25), explains that the whole-wheat berries used in this 
Italian dessert should be the berries of soft spring wheat. Otherwise the 
berries will harden a day or so after the pastiera is made. He suggests that 
you can get good results when soft spring wheat berries aren't available by 
substituting cracked wheat or even barley. We haven't tried his substitutions, 
but they should work. 
</P>
<P>
If a more traditional cheesecake appeals to you, some of California's top chefs 
and good home cooks have shared their recipes with us also. Joachim Splichal, 
who with his wife, Christine, recently opened Patina on Melrose Avenue, gave us 
an elegant recipe for a cheesecake made with hazelnuts and brown sugar and 
topped with a crispy filo and almond crust. This is one of those desserts 
that's almost too pretty to cut into. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dodge, author of the award-winning cookbook "The American Baker" (Simon 
&amp; Schuster: $24.95), gave us a recipe for a wonderful cheesecake made with 
ricotta and encased in a tender, flaky crust. 
</P>
<P>
Still other professional chefs who have shared cheesecake recipes with us are 
Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger of City Restaurant. These two well-known 
young chefs and authors of the cookbook "City Cuisine" (William Morrow, $19.95) 
gave us a recipe right in line with the season as it combines pumpkin with 
cream cheese and flavors the mixture with pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and 
ginger juice. The result is ideal for a Thanksgiving dessert. 
</P>
<P>
One recipe that came our way, Grandma Elsie's Cheesecake, was shared by fellow 
Times staffer Amy Klein, who told us that she has to bake it for her father's 
birthday every year. "He can eat one-fourth of the cake in a sitting," she 
said, "and we all wait for his arteries to clog while he does it." 
</P>
<P>
And for those who hanker for cheesecake but really can't manage the calories or 
fats found in the real thing, we've included a recipe for Cherry Cheesecake, a 
light cheesecake-style dessert that boasts considerably fewer calories and fats 
than most cheesecakes. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: CONSISTENT QUALITY OF FARRELL VINTAGES BEGINS IN RUSSIAN RIVER 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HEALDSBURG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be that no two entities were better matched than the Russian River 
Valley and Gary Farrell. Or perhaps it's just that Farrell listens carefully 
and hears what the grapes are saying. 
</P>
<P>
But for sheer consistency, I can think of no one who has made such high-quality 
wines that evoke the region's uniqueness, and someone who has improved the 
quality of his wines so regularly the way Farrell has. 
</P>
<P>
Though his is not a name you've heard mentioned in the company of the world's 
great wine makers, Farrell has achieved much in the 15 years he's been in this 
industry and to my mind stands with the great ones. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this bearded gentleman is so quiet and unassuming that even when he's 
pouring his wines at public events, his soft voice and modest manner make him 
appear to be no more than a pourer who is cautious about making bold statements 
about the quality of the wines. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason Farrell's name is known largely to wine connoisseurs is that he 
is the wine maker for Davis Bynum Winery, a small property with a nonexistent 
advertising budget. It is a winery that could very well say it's distribution 
system is an oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the wines Farrell makes are crafted in a style that is anything but 
showy. Thus the greatness of his art usually is exhibited in small, delicate, 
finely detailed works, not giant frescos strewn with bold colors. 
</P>
<P>
This article was prompted by what I consider to be one of the finest American 
Pinot Noirs I have tasted in years. Released under Farrell's own label, the 
wine was made in a style that accents the vineyards. More about it later. 
</P>
<P>
I also was inspired by the fact that the Bynum wines, after a hiatus from the 
marketplace in some areas of the country, are now available again, a welcome 
end to a drought. And the fact that the Farrell wines are now being made in 
quantities large enough to write about. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian River area of Sonoma County is a cool region that runs north and 
west from Santa Rosa, reaching as far north as Healdsburg and west to 
Guerneville. Included are such towns as Sebastopol to the southwest and 
Forestville due west, with Windsor at its heart. 
</P>
<P>
It is a region that is actually cooler than the famed Carneros, the swath of 
land that sits at the southerly edge of both Napa and Sonoma counties and which 
is renowned for its Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, pockets of the Russian River area produce the finest Pinot Noirs in 
America, and its Chardonnays are fast becoming recognized as some of the most 
classic made anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dehlinger's 1985 Chardonnay wowed the marketplace with rich flavors in a crisp 
package; Joseph Swan's wines from Russian River fruit are sought for their 
depth and potential; De Loach and Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnays are award-winners 
every year, and some exciting Pinot Noirs have been made by J. Rochioli, Iron 
Horse, Belvedere and Mark West. (Farrell was Rochioli's wine maker for four 
years, 1983 through 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the cult wineries of the Russian River area is Williams Selyem, a 
project of Burt Williams and Ed Selyem, Sonoma County partners who have made a 
stunning succession of Pinot Noirs from the area. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Williams Selyem wines are no exception, either, but they are next to 
impossible to find and expensive: $30 for the top-of-the- line wine from the 
Rochioli Vineyard. Still, should you find a bottle, it is worth a try. They are 
truly exciting wines. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis Bynum winery, founded by the former San Francisco newspaperman who 
gave his name to the winery, has less acclaim, but the wines are nearly as 
good. And the property has been around a while. 
</P>
<P>
Bynum celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, and if it stages an open house 
to celebrate, some guests will get lost finding it. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years making wine in Berkeley, in San Francisco's east bay, Bynum 
bought a hillside ranch separated from Healdsburg by twisting sidepaths that 
snake through the foothill oaks. The location was selected, in part, because of 
the quality of the grapes growing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an old hop kiln, and I helped Dave convert it into a winery," said 
Farrell, who arrived just after Davis and Dorothy Bynum bought the place. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell then was a house painter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a political science major (at Santa Rosa Junior College before earning a 
degree at Sonoma State), and after school I started a house painting business," 
said Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
With partner Scott Harris (now wine maker at Arbor Crest Winery in Washington), 
Farrell painted houses for 18 months. In late 1974, Bynum's first crush at its 
Sonoma winery facility, "we began helping with the harvest, as cellar workers." 
</P>
<P>
An abiding interest in wine, gained while in college in Sonoma County, prompted 
Farrell and Harris to become the ultimate cellar workers, spending their off 
hours studying wine making. Both were soon hired as full time cellar workers, 
and Farrell "gave up painting houses. I picked up wine making skills on the 
job," he said. "I took UC Davis extension classes in enology and I made a lot 
of phone calls to other wineries." 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, Farrell was made head wine maker; Davis and his son, Hampton, removed 
themselves to the sales and marketing office. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade the winery has made some exceptional wines in small 
quantities. Marketing in Southern California was done by Simon Levi until that 
company's demise some months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we had no distribution in a major area of the state," said 
Hamp. "If we went to one of the major distributors, we'd get lost in their 
book." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, Bynum was picked up by J. Sosnick, a speciality food 
company, and is now back in circulation in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
As I write this, I am sipping a glass of 1988 Davis Bynum Gewurztraminer ($8), 
which annually is one of the finest wines of its type made in California. This 
one is gorgeous, made essentially dry but with such intense spice character 
that it begs to be served with Sichuan food. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, ever modest, says the wine annually is made from grapes that might 
frighten another wine maker -- acidity so low you'd think the best thing to do 
with the stuff is make grape juice. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrell has a touch with this wine, as with many wines. Moreover, all the 
Bynum wines are well priced including the lovely 1986 Bynum Pinot Noir Limited 
Release ($14). The aroma of this pink/ruby-colored wine is more Burgundian, 
with spicy tea and rose scents, cherrylike fruit and a silky finish. 
</P>
<P>
This is typical Farrell wine making, deft and elegant, letting the fruit speak. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the best wines I have ever tasted is the 1987 Gary Farrell Pinot 
Noir ($15), a strikingly handsome wine with a profusion of fruit/spice elements 
such as cherries, roses, cloves and other Far East scents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid this wine would show well so early that it would overshadow this 
one," said Farrell as he poured the 1987 Gary Farrell "Howard Allen" Pinot Noir 
($20), a more concentrated wine in which the accent is on depth and richness. 
The Allen wine is a marvel of intensity that would do well with a rest in a 
cellar for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
All three wines are superb examples of Russian River Pinot Noir, and are worth 
seeking out. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's Chardonnays are also stunning. The 1987 Bynum Artist Label ($14; with 
a drawing by Dorothy Bynum) is a richer wine with creamy texture and a citrusy 
aftertaste. The 1988 Bynum Sonoma County ($10) is a remarkable value. The 
spicyness combines with rich citrusy fruit to make a lean yet mouthfilling 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Gary Farrell Chardonnay ($16) is the best of the three, with loads of 
citrusy/spicy elements and a crisp, inviting finish. No overt buttery elements 
here, just classical Chardonnay fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cabernets from Farrell are also pleasing: 1986 Bynum ($10) has a richness 
akin to chocolate in the aroma and a complex finish, an excellent value. The 
1987 Gary Farrell Cabernet ($16) has more anise in the nose and a lovely lean 
structure that indicates it will age handsomely. Aeration helps both wines show 
their greatness. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell makes only 4,000 cases of wine under his own label and distribution in 
Southern California is thus far limited. (Wine House in West Los Angeles, 
Hi-Time in Costa Mesa and Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach are three locations 
where they may be found.) The Bynum wines are slowly getting back into the Los 
Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
For information on obtaining Farrell's wines by mail, drop a note to Farrell, 
P.O. Box 342, Forestville, Calif. 95436. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 St. Andrews Vineyard Chardonnay ($13.75) -- The 1987 
vintage in California did not produce a great many classic Chardonnays, I am 
discovering. Many of the wines lack the fruit character of 1985s and 1986s. 
However, a few wines achieved a degree of richness worthy of mention. This is 
one of those wines, made by wine maker Daryl Ecklund to accent richness and 
smokiness. For those who like a fuller-bodied style of wine, this is one to 
consider.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: NUTRIENT-RICH CRUCIFERAE VEGETABLES BUILD CHARACTER INTO 
FAMILY MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blackberries in Boston? Peaches in Pittsburgh? In the dead of winter? No 
problem, provided that you're willing to pay the price -- and compromise a 
little on flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Many produce items once limited to certain regions or seasons are now available 
every day of the year -- a feat made possible by modern packaging and handling 
methods, coupled with a transportation network that brings remote corners of 
the world as close as a neighborhood supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
No one suggests that we reset the clock to when our ancestors enjoyed cucumbers 
for only five months a year (and ate the surplus as pickles the rest of the 
time), and fresh tomatoes for an even briefer period. On the other hand, it's 
regrettable many of us have forgotten, or never tried, the vegetable delights 
that sustained folks not only in the fall, harvested at peak, but also as they 
were held over long winters in root cellars, dried or preserved. Among these 
are the Cruciferae, a group of vegetables with four-petal flowers in the shape 
of a cross. 
</P>
<P>
Like most other vegetables, the Cruciferae are potent sources of vitamins and 
minerals. They contain few calories and are virtually fat-free. But when it 
comes to meal preparation, vegetables -- the Cruciferae included -- too often 
get shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
We can't pretend that overcooked, under-seasoned broccoli, Brussels sprouts and 
turnips are irresistibly appealing. What we can say is that properly prepared 
and seasoned, these and other Cruciferae -- cabbage, cauliflower, mustard 
greens, kale, collards, kohlrabi, turnips and rutabagas -- will lend taste, 
texture and nutrition to meals. 
</P>
<P>
First, consider calories. A half-cup serving of any of these vegetables ranges 
from a low of 7 calories for turnip greens to a high of 40 calories for mashed 
rutabaga. Even twice that amount, if not drenched in butter or cheese sauce, 
will hardly break the day's calorie bank. 
</P>
<P>
Next, check nutrients. A half-cup serving of broccoli or Brussels sprouts 
provides nearly all the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for Vitamin C -- as 
much as a half cup of orange juice. Various other Cruciferae -- cabbage, 
cauliflower, collards, kale, rutabaga and turnip greens -- also contribute 
substantial Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
As for Vitamin A, the Cruciferae represent some of the richest sources of beta 
carotene, which the body converts to make that vitamin. One half-cup serving of 
collards meets the entire day's RDA, and a half cup of kale goes about 80% of 
the way. But there are several other good sources, too, including broccoli, 
Brussels sprouts and turnip greens. 
</P>
<P>
These vegetables, particularly collards, kale and broccoli, contribute calcium, 
too. Most contain appreciable amounts of iron and are generally good sources of 
fiber. Finally, increased use of Cruciferae has been linked in some studies to 
reduced risk of certain cancers. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there's plenty to recommend these foods nutritionally; the challenge 
is to get people to partake of them often. An important first step is proper 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The plain fact is that these vegetables don't take kindly to overcooking. 
Broccoli and Brussels sprouts, for instance, are far better served on the 
slightly crunchy side than limp, yellowed and tasting of the sulfur compound 
that makes them unappealing to people of all ages. Depending on the size of the 
pieces, four servings of broccoli cook in just 5 minutes in a microwave oven, 
or about 10 minutes if steamed. 
</P>
<P>
Timing for other Cruciferae varies with the size of the pieces, but all require 
relatively brief cooking, far less than the rest of the meal. They also require 
little personal attention, apart from an occasional glance to check for 
overcooking. 
</P>
<P>
A second approach to overcoming resistance is to combine these vegetables with 
other, milder ones. Brussels sprouts can be mixed with carrots or lightly 
sauteed mushrooms. Cauliflower and small green peas harmonize well. Shredded 
turnips and carrots, lightly steamed and enhanced by chopped dill, are another 
good team for flavor and texture. You can combine rutabaga, turnips and even 
cauliflower in equal parts with mashed potato and season with freshly grated 
nutmeg for an excellent puree. Chopped collards can be cooked with rice in a 
chicken broth, and steamed kale goes well with cooked lentils generously 
seasoned with black pepper. 
</P>
<P>
While we think nothing tastes better than a plain, properly cooked vegetable 
with its true flavor shining through, judicious use of herbs and spices can add 
sparkle. Try chopped parsley and chives on cauliflower, or caraway seeds on 
Brussels sprouts steamed in chicken broth. Sauteed green onion enlivens the 
flavor of kale or other greens. 
</P>
<P>
Or make a simple sauce of yogurt seasoned with horseradish, pepper, vinegar and 
a dash of salt to top broccoli. Cruciferae may never replace peas on the 
banquet circuit, but if well prepared, they can add character to many a family 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking With Alcohol Not a Caloric Problem 
</P>
<P>
Question: While preparing dinner the other day, my sister and I got into an 
argument about calories from alcohol used in cooking. She said they evaporate, 
but I thought otherwise. Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It depends on how you use the alcohol. If you're talking about the 
dramatic effect created by pouring warm rum or brandy on dessert and igniting 
it with a match, then your sister is correct. The alcohol does "go up in 
smoke." On the other hand, if you use wine, beer or even brandy as part of the 
liquid in which meat, fish or chicken is simmered, then your answer is the 
right one. 
</P>
<P>
Both beer and wine are diluted alcohol solutions, weakened still further 
because they usually account for only part of the cooking liquid -- along with 
vegetable or fruit juices, broth and natural juices that seep from food as it 
cooks. And while brandy starts out with a much higher alcohol content, using it 
as part of the cooking liquid dilutes it, too. Diluted alcohol evaporates quite 
slowly, so what you added is pretty close to what you have when the dish is 
cooked. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you are counting calories very carefully, it should not affect your 
decision to use some alcohol in cooking when it enhances the flavor of the 
dish. A cup of wine used in a recipe for six servings would provide just 35 
calories, assuming all the sauce was consumed, which is not always the case. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm in my first year at college. Before I went away I decided to become a 
vegetarian. I pay careful attention to my diet, and am reasonably sure I'm 
getting all the nutrients I need. However, I read that getting enough iron can 
be a problem, especially for young women, and that substances in the diet can 
inhibit absorption. Is this something I should worry about? 
</P>
<P>
A: A number of foods contain substances that inhibit iron absorption. More than 
20 years ago a group of British scientists accidentally discovered that eggs 
affect the body's ability to take up iron. Phytic acid in whole grains also 
binds the mineral, making it unavailable. So, too, do large amounts of 
cellulose (one of the fractions of fiber), tannins in tea and polyphenols in 
coffee. But to those who do not consider the day started without a cup of 
coffee, or lunch ended without tea, the suggestion to drink these beverages 
apart from meals is clearly unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, it is also known that one of the things that enhances 
the absorption of "non-heme" iron, found in grains, vegetables and fruits, is 
ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). In practical terms, this means that taking a glass 
of orange juice increases the amount of iron absorbed from your cereal. 
Similarly, eating broccoli at a meal with dried beans will mean that you will 
benefit more from the iron they provide. 
</P>
<P>
In short, to maximize iron absorption, it's a good idea to inject a good source 
of Vitamin C into meals whenever you can. Along with orange juice and broccoli, 
that would include other citrus fruits, melons, strawberries and vegetables 
such as green pepper, cauliflower, kale, spinach, turnip greens and cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In recent years I've noticed that so-called fresh chickens in my supermarket 
are really frozen. The department manager assures me that these are not frozen 
birds in the process of thawing. He claims that fresh birds are now kept at a 
lower temperature to permit them to stay fresh longer. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Fresh chicken in the supermarket case often gives the appearance of 
being frozen but, in fact, only the surface is icy. Underneath the meat is well 
chilled, but not solid. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, poultry plants commonly pack chickens in ice and maintain them at a 
temperature just below 32 degrees , or chill them with nitrogen. Either method 
removes body heat rapidly and preserves the bird on the way to the supermarket. 
Birds processed this way can remain fresh longer -- up to seven days in the 
refrigerator case. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm an avid reader of ingredients lists and never cease to be amazed at what 
I find. For instance, recently I noticed that frankfurters and luncheon meats 
contain corn syrup. Then I became curious about just how much sweetener they 
contain, but there was no way to tell from the ingredients list. I wonder if 
you could provide the information. 
</P>
<P>
A: They don't contain much. Frankfurters, bologna and similar products can 
contain a maximum of 2% corn syrup by weight. That translates to just over half 
a gram per ounce. To put that into more visual terms, a one-ounce slice of 
bologna would contain about 1/8 teaspoon of corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
Question: During the holiday season, I plan to eat both duck and goose. I 
realize they contain more fat than chicken, but is that fat more saturated too? 
</P>
<P>
Another question: Are turkey and chicken frankfurters high in fat? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, the fat in duck and goose is more saturated than that in chicken, 
but the nutritional significance is small if you eat them only rarely and 
especially if portion sizes are controlled. As a point of reference, 3 1/2 
ounces of dark-meat chicken without the skin contains a total of about 10 grams 
of fat, of which a little more than 2 1/2 grams is saturated. That amount of 
chicken, by the way, would contain about 205 calories. 
</P>
<P>
While calorically comparable, the same size portion of duck would have a little 
more saturated fat: over four grams. The same amount of goose would provide 4 
1/2 grams of fat and a total of 240 calories. 
</P>
<P>
If the 3 1/2 ounces of dark-meat chicken included the skin, it would provide as 
much saturated fat as the goose, and 250 calories. 
</P>
<P>
As to your second question: Despite the fact that they may be labeled as 
"reduced fat," 70% or more of the calories in chicken or turkey dogs can come 
from fat. Three-and-a-half ounces (about two hot dogs) provide 5 1/2 to 6 grams 
of saturated fat and between 225 and 260 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have recently begun to do some cross-country skiing, and have found that I 
really do enjoy it. Can you tell me how many calories I am burning as I 
traverse the snow? 
</P>
<P>
A: The exact figure will depend on the terrain, the condition of the snow, and 
on how fast you are going. In general, you will spend somewhere between 0.098 
and 0.143 calories per kilogram of body weight per minute, depending on whether 
you were skiing leisurely on light snow or walking on your skies on hard snow. 
(In the extreme, going uphill at top speed you will burn 0.274 calories per 
kilogram per minute.) 
</P>
<P>
To calculate more precisely how many calories you burn, you will need to start 
by dividing your body weight in pounds by 2.2 to convert it to kilograms and 
then multiply it by an average figure for energy expended and by the length of 
time you spend skiing. Take an individual weighing 160 pounds, or 72.7 
kilograms, skiing for an hour. Since conditions vary, we will take the midpoint 
of the usual range, or 0.121 calories per kilogram per minute. In that case, 
you could expect to burn about 530 calories an hour. For purposes of 
comparison, an hour of leisure biking at a rate of 5 1/2 miles per hour would 
burn 279 calories.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SMOKERS URGED TO TAKE MORE VITAMIN C, WITH VEGETABLES A 
GOOD SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10th edition of the Recommended Dietary Allowances, which were recently 
announced, encouraged smokers to increase their intake of Vitamin C to 100 
milligrams per day in order to replenish body stores depleted by smoking. Since 
winter produce is a primary source of the nutrient, now is a good time to take 
advantage of its nourishing effect. 
</P>
<P>
According to USDA Handbook 8, oranges, kiwis, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, 
kohlrabi, cauliflower and raw cabbage are ideal for meeting the body's need for 
Vitamin C. Oranges and kiwis provide more than 100% of the daily allowance for 
Vitamin C. They are the fruits of choice -- boasting 70 mg. per whole orange, 
about 74 mg. for each kiwi. 
</P>
<P>
As vegetables go, Brussels sprouts and broccoli are best. A one-half cup 
serving of either cooked sprouts or diced broccoli pieces has about 48 mg. of 
Vitamin C. The same size portion of kohlrabi has about 44.5 mg. Cooked 
cauliflower, a one-half cup serving of flowerettes, provides about 34 mg. 
Cabbage, a lesser source, offers about 15 mg. per one-half cup. 
</P>
<P>
While the RDA of 60 milligrams is sufficient to prevent scurvy (10 mg. is 
required for protection), it is thought that the additional intake may provide 
some protection against cancer for smokers. However, there is no data to 
support a link between increased Vitamin C intake and decreased risk. 
</P>
<P>
What is known about the nutrient is its value in the formation of collagen, the 
protein that provides elasticity to tissues. Collagen is the foundation for 
various organs within the body, such as bones, teeth, skin and tendons. It also 
is an element of scar tissue, which heals wounds. It makes up the reinforcing 
structure that mends fractures and the supporting material of capillaries that 
prevents bruises. Vitamin C protects against infections, enhances iron 
absorption and serves as an antioxidant, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin C is, however, easily destroyed. As a water-soluble substance, it is 
easily leached out of foods by overcooking and it is excreted in the urine 
daily. Therefore, health professionals recommend replenishing blood stores each 
day with foods rich in the vitamin. This should eliminate the need for 
excessive intake through vitamin supplements.

RECIPES THAT TAKE YOU BACK TO SCHOOL DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just about every year at this time, nostalgia over foods eaten in school 
cafeterias years ago rears a maudlin head. 
</P>
<P>
How good or bad those school day foods actually were matters not. It's how well 
remembered, adored and revered they are today that counts. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Gilges of Long Beach writes: "In the cafeteria in the early '60s, they 
used to make a tuna sandwich and a killer peanut butter cookie. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Vakovich remembers a crumb cake sold during nutrition break. "It's been a 
very long time since I've eaten that great cake," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
So we're back digging in our files for those long-lost recipes for cookies, 
pizzas, cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Experience throughout the years has told us that sweets are remembered most 
fondly and most frequently. Ranger Cookies (also known as Flying Saucers), the 
most frequently requested school recipe, was formulated for home use by a 
cereal manufacturer in 1952, according to school officials interviewed some 
years ago. Back then the Los Angeles City Unified School District food service 
director was Helen Crane, who adapted the recipe that has been a favorite 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an oversized chocolate chip cookie and a plain, moist and dense crumb 
cake, the standard breakfast item today, are considered the most popular sweets 
on the a la carte menu, according to Anita King, now head of nutrition services 
for the Los Angeles City Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Today, too, attitudes toward sweets have dramatically altered school menus, 
particularly the dessert menu. 
</P>
<P>
School district nutritionists have markedly curbed dessert offerings in the 
School Lunch Program in an effort to conform to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to 
reduce fats and sugars in the diet. Today, school lunch rooms are serving 
occasional cookies such as apple-oatmeal, ice milk and fruit juice bars along 
with fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten away from serving desserts almost entirely in the last seven or 
eight years. We try to encourage fresh fruit for school lunches," said King. 
</P>
<P>
Sugary goodies, however, have been available on an a la carte basis all along. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Devil's Food Cake, which was introduced in 1939 to the Los 
Angeles City Schools by Frances Johnson, when she was a manager at one of the 
schools. Today, the recipe for the dark, moist cake derives its red coloring 
from baking soda, not the red food dye used in the past. "The cake is 
especially good when frosted with Seven Minute Frosting, and dribbled with 
melted chocolate," suggested King. And there are readers who have reminded us 
how wonderful that gooey cake was -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Sour Cream Coffeecake, a version of the breakfast coffee crumb cake requested 
by Vakovich, has been part of the school cafeteria repertoire since 1959 and is 
still served at special school functions. 
</P>
<P>
A peanut crunch, still requested by readers, was served in the Glendale Unified 
School District for years and was one of the all-time favorites of that school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Among the favorite entrees most requested throughout the years has been pizza, 
which made its debut in 1957 in the Long Beach Unified School District. Today, 
according to King, pizza is numero uno, along with tacos and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, however, when the best-remembered entrees were such school 
favorites as chopped beef and gravy over mashed potatoes and roast beef hash, 
no longer served in schools. Readers, however, still request the recipes. And 
we still print them. 
</P>
<P>
Here they are, along with other old and new recipes from school cafeterias that 
will no doubt be passed on through the years to come, like heirlooms: 
</P>
<P>

USC FANS SCORE AT BEACH PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINING: TAILGATE COMPETITION PROVIDES CREATIVE IDEAS FOR MENU AND 
PRESENTATION OF MOVABLE FEASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
USC football fans were in peak party form last Saturday as evidenced by the 
First Annual Trojan Tailgate Competition sponsored by the school's Department 
of Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Although both the Coliseum's Exposition Park and the USC Campus are always 
filled to overflowing with pregame picnics on most fall Saturdays, the 
festivities were much enhanced last weekend by the contest's beach party theme. 
</P>
<P>
Lawns normally reserved for blankets, folding chairs and barbecue grills were 
transformed into a sea of volleyball nets, beach umbrellas, lavish buffets, 
tropical drinks and tiki lamps. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't too difficult to imagine that some party-goers were actually at the 
beach considering the large amounts of sand imported to the park just for the 
occasion. Surf boards were also in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the event's authenticity was perfect 80-degree weather and an 
anticipated postgame concert by the Beach Boys, the group's second appearance 
at the Coliseum following a USC game in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Groups entering the tailgate contest were asked to form teams to compete for 
round-trip airline tickets, dinners at area restaurants and scoreboard 
recognition after the game against Oregon State. Judges rated the various 
parties based on menu, theme/originality and attendance. There were three prize 
winners in each category. 
</P>
<P>
One of the day's liveliest gatherings was in and around Bloody Mary's Grass 
Shack, a bamboo hut assembled just for the party. Ron Ellico, the team's 
captain, was attired in nothing more than a grass skirt and straw hat. He 
amused the competition's judges with a lumbering hula dance that ultimately led 
to first prize in the theme/originality category. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups, the USC Wok Team, served an incredibly diverse selection of 
food. Led by Ken Matsuda and Paul Chan, the party was overwhelming guests with 
a wide assortment of food prepared on portable deep fryers, woks, grills and 
steamers. Some of the Wok Team's items included fried calamari, sashimi, 
chicken teriyaki, roast pork, and stir-fried noodles. The Wok Team also served 
steamed New Zealand green-lipped mussels. Matsuda, a former USC track coach, 
enticed the judges with the perfectly steamed mollusks saying, "You'll never 
get anything like this around here. Try them, they're great." 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda and Chan, who are known for always having elaborate tailgate parties 
before and after USC football games, were awarded second prize in the menu 
category. The team's finish can only be considered an upset, according to those 
familiar with USC tailgate legend. 
</P>
<P>
The winners in the food category were the Newport Beach Boys &amp; Girls. The 
group had a tastefully decorated buffet table filled with grilled bratwurst, 
sauerkraut, German potato salad, caviar and sushi. The Newporters showed 
excellent taste in wine by pouring a couple of fine Napa Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Chardonnays. The group, led by Allen Gilchrist, also offered an 
extensive dessert table. 
</P>
<P>
Another spirited gathering was coordinated by the Trojan Beach Boys. The group 
let guests choose from several tropical drinks -- blue Hawaiian, strawberry 
daiquiri and pina colada -- made in blenders that were powered by a portable 
generator. The menu consisted of shrimp kebabs, salads, barbecue chicken, 
pineapple and a fully stocked bar. Elaborately decorated cakes were also on 
display, but one of the organizers, Jack Tingley, said, "No one ever eats the 
cakes, but they look really nice." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan Beach Boys were awarded second place in the spirit competition 
helped, in part, by Tingley's sharp Samoan wrap-around skirt, normally worn by 
men only on the South Pacific island itself. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the non-winners demonstrated a great deal of initiative. At a 
party called the Dead Beat Club, a 6-foot-long inflated life raft filled with 
ice was used as a cooler for drink and food. Asked about the raft, team captain 
Alan Baron said they brought it along "because it fit the theme. Hey, we're at 
the beach here." The club also set up a palm frond-decorated bar, well-stocked 
with an assortment of tropical elixirs. 
</P>
<P>
At another location, Rand Beardslee, who was the captain of the Trojan Beach 
Bum team, had a silver serving bowl filled with fish eggs. As the judges 
approached he yelled out, "I've got caviar, go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Few took him up on the invitation, though. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the good-natured controversy over the menu category winners, the 
event was judged a complete success and will be repeated with various themes 
each year, according to Ron Orr, USC's assistant athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity and originality demonstrated on Saturday indicates that at least 
the USC tailgate enthusiasts are in fine shape for the activities preceding the 
big game against cross-town rival UCLA on Nov. 18 at the Coliseum.

VILLAGE COURT RESIDENTS GONE; BITTERNESS STAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The southern half of the Village Court apartments, a cottage-style complex for 
low-income residents in north Glendale, was silent, empty and dead at noon 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Its gardens have grown wild from neglect. Paint was beginning to peel off the 
buildings' wooden window frames. No one walked the sidewalks. The lawn chairs 
in the patio were rusty and empty. 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining tenants had quietly stashed away their belongings in 
cardboard boxes. The others have all relocated, but leaving hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments in the 1100 block of North Central Avenue were built in World 
War II to house Air Force officers and their families. Three years ago the 
Mormon Church brought them. In June the church served 120-day eviction notices 
on the residents of 75 of the 146-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials said the southern half of the apartments, which border a 
Mormon church, will be razed to make room for an expansion of the worship hall 
and a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The northern wing remains occupied. The church has not made public any plans 
for it, but its 100 or so residents fear that they also will soon be ordered 
out. "We don't know what's going to happen," said Gretchen Berlew, whose cozy 
two-bedroom home escaped demolition. "This is like my own little house. 
Wouldn't it be awful if I had to lose it?" 
</P>
<P>
The evicted tenants, most of whom are elderly and living on fixed incomes, were 
given two months' free rent, and a relocation agency was hired to help them 
find new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them thought their eviction was not fair and decided to fight the 
church. Marion Simmons, a Village Court resident for more than 20 years, and 
two others filed a lawsuit claiming the church had no right to deplete the 
city's low-income housing stock. It was dropped when Simmons died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of residents went to City Hall in September and asked the council 
to reconsider the zoning administrator's decision to allow the demolition. The 
council refused. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days after moving to a new apartment, Barbara Simmons -- no relation to 
Marion -- also died. She had been suffering from a lung disease for years, a 
friend said, and was wearing an oxygen mask when her husband helped her out of 
Village Court. Susan Barklay, another resident, suffered a stroke while packing 
and was sent to a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very lonely feeling in the village right now," said Wayne Westand, one 
of the two remaining residents. He fought back tears as he prepared to leave 
Friday. "Lonely, sad and poignant." 
</P>
<P>
Westand was angry. Not so much against the church -- "they did what they had to 
do" -- but against the Glendale City Council. "They were remiss in 
investigating the situation. It shows the city doesn't care about 
non-property-owners." 
</P>
<P>
The other tenant, who requested anonymity, was downright bitter. "At a certain 
point in your life, society tells you that your contributions are no longer 
needed so lay down, die and get out of our way. That's what they did to us." 
</P>
<P>
She said she rented a place "out of desperation without even looking at it." 
Social Security is her only source of income. She does not know if she can 
afford the $135 monthly rent increase the move will cost her. 
</P>
<P>
Both tenants were given extensions from their Nov. 1 deadlines to finish 
packing. Church officials in Glendale and Salt Lake City responsible for the 
evictions could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Hanson, the apartment manager, said, "It's always tough when you have to 
move anybody, but the process went pretty well. We've been able to place 
everybody, and everyone seems satisfied."

GLENDALE TO BUY RAILROAD STATION; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE CITY COUNCIL SETS ASIDE MORE THAN $3.5 MILLION FOR A 
HISTORIC STRUCTURE THAT IS TO BECOME A REGIONAL TRANSIT CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Glendale City Council allocated more than $3.5 million Tuesday to buy the 
historic Southern Pacific Railroad depot and develop plans for turning it into 
a regional transit center. 
</P>
<P>
The action was the first step toward building a $7-million hub for a variety of 
transportation -- the Amtrak train and commuter rail with a planned light-rail 
system, shuttle buses and van pools -- to relieve downtown traffic congestion, 
said Steve Adams, project director and assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city plans to hire an expert in historical preservation to help 
plan for the 66-year-old depot, which is distinguished by its Spanish-Colonial 
Revival architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The station at 400 W. Cerritos Ave in south Glendale near the Golden State 
Freeway is on the site of the first Glendale train depot, built in 1883. 
</P>
<P>
"It is equally important to preserve that building as a historical site as it 
is to develop some kind of transportation center," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials called a special meeting with traffic-management consultants 
Monday to urge rapid development of a computer program to project the traffic 
impact of new development. 
</P>
<P>
"The information is vital, and we can't afford to make a mistake," Councilman 
Larry Zarian, chairman of the Glendale Redevelopment Agency, said at the study 
session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants have assured Glendale that it is a long way from gridlock. But city 
officials, who are spending millions to widen streets and modernize traffic 
signals, say such improvements have limited potential. Also, Glendale and all 
other cities in California are mandated by state law to curtail the number of 
automobiles on the road to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"Every city is going to have to consider alternative transportation systems," 
Councilman Carl Raggio said at the session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials six years ago talked about building a transportation 
center inside the redevelopment zone, possibly at Harvard Street and Brand 
Boulevard. Those plans faded as officials realized they need to steer traffic 
away from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
They hit upon the idea of converting the depot into a transportation center 
less than three months ago when the city learned that Southern Pacific is ready 
to dispose of the property, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The station, which is leased by Amtrak, "is an excess to our operating needs," 
said Rick Gooch, assistant regional director of real estate for Southern 
Pacific, which recently was acquired by the Rio Grande Industries and limited 
to freight. He said the depot "is more in line with passenger service, which 
the city has in mind for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials fear that if they do not buy the station, it will be sold 
for industrial use. "We have had numerous inquiries on that station area," 
Gooch said. "I don't foresee any problems selling it should the city decide it 
doesn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price is under negotiation. Council members met in closed session 
last week to discuss the city's offer, which is expected to be made next week, 
Adams said. Southern Pacific wants to complete the sale before the end of the 
year, according to Gooch. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale would follow Santa Monica, Burbank and Pasadena in acquiring a 
railroad station for a transportation center, according to Roberta Tinajero, a 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The money allocated by the council Tuesday will come from the city's $7.5 
million reserve of revenues from the half-cent Proposition A sales tax hike 
authorized by voters in 1980, said Brian Butler, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditure still requires the approval of the Transportation Commission, 
but the commission's Transit Committee on Monday recommended approval of the 
project, which is expected to be routinely endorsed by the full commission 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the city's funds will be used for a feasibility study and development 
of a master plan. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans call for construction of a multilevel garage surrounding the 
station on the 2.4-acre site. The $4-million garage would be designed so 
additional levels could be added, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of downtown businesses in Glendale would be encouraged to park at the 
station and ride shuttles to work. The council report called the train station 
"strategically significant" because it is located outside downtown, near a 
freeway and is serviced by wide streets in a largely industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
The center could also serve commuters going to downtown Los Angeles or other 
cities served by Amtrak, such as San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara, 
according to the report. It called the station "an important stopping point on 
the way to Hollywood, Burbank and the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale had fallen behind other cities in developing a regional transportation 
plan until last year. Pasadena, for example, has been given priority for a 
light-rail transit system by the Transportation Commission, which next year is 
expected to divvy up about $800 million in Proposition A funds for transit 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale officials have been working feverishly to catch up. A joint 
city-county study on possible light-rail routes connecting the Amtrak station 
with the downtown area is nearing completion, and officials hope to pick one of 
six potential routes within two months, even though public funding for the 
project may be at least 15 years away. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get moved up on the list of priorities" of the county 
Transportation Commission, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Rebeiro, a spokesman for Barton-Aschman of Pasadena, Glendale's traffic 
consultants, warned council members Monday that growing congestion "may force 
you into a more aggressive traffic management program." 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering requiring all new developers in the downtown area to 
provide employee parking outside of the downtown and to operate shuttle buses 
to get employees to work. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zarian said Monday, "The question is how much more development can 
the city absorb and still be able to handle the traffic?" 
</P>
<P>
Additional study sessions are expected to be held early next year.

CHARGES FILED AGAINST MOTHER OF TRUANT CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of a 15-year-old Glendale girl who has attended school only a few 
days since 1987 will be prosecuted because of her daughter's truancy, the first 
time the Glendale Unified School District has pressed for criminal action over 
a child's absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Birss has been charged with failure to comply with the State Education 
Code, which requires parents to ensure that youths ages 6 to 18 attend school 
daily. Birss has been ordered to appear Dec. 6 in Glendale Municipal Court and 
could face up to $230 in fines if convicted, said Glendale Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Michael Pargament, who filed the charge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under Los Angeles County's Truancy Mediation Program, initiated in February by 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, school districts increasingly have taken legal action 
against parents of chronically truant children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This finally starts to give the system some real teeth in dealing with 
truancy," said William Card, coordinator of attendance for the Glendale school 
district. "We provide a number of interventions along the years to try to keep 
kids in school. When it comes to the point that nothing changes the situation, 
the referral is given to the district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
Court documents showed that Birss' daughter had a history of truancy dating 
back to second grade. In 1987, the girl failed to attend her seventh-grade 
classes at Wilson Junior High School and was put in a continuation school. The 
girl skipped classes there and did not show up for two meetings with a county 
review board, the records showed. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, who attended one of those meetings, told school officials that her 
daughter ran away whenever school was discussed and lived with a friend, a 
court file indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Birss nor her daughter could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The school district each summer mails more than 400 notices to parents of 
students who have missed more than 20 days in the 180-day school year, Card 
said. If school officials cannot resolve the problems with parents and truant 
students, the matter is referred to a School Attendance Review Board, made up 
of community representatives who decide whether truancy cases should be 
referred to the district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 55 cases were referred to Glendale's board, and two were recommended 
for prosecution. One was resolved in a hearing, and the other led to the charge 
against Birss, Card said. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Pasadena, 20 truancy cases are pending against parents, said 
Pasadena Deputy Dist. Atty. Frederick J. Kubik.

He sells fiberglass and Brazilian yogurt, eats lunch with Japanese office 
ladies, brings silent cheer to sick children and hovers above Macy's 
Thanksgiving parade. One look at him, and you start mouthing his song. 
</P>
<P>
He's hot -- hot pink -- and today the Pink Panther turns 25. This week, which 
his creators have dubbed "Paint the Town Pink" week, he is celebrating with a 
slew of visits to hospitals, cheerleading contests at malls and a 
celebrity-studded charity fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he was honored with proclamations in Hollywood and in Culver City, 
where his home office, MGM/UA Communications Co., is located. 
</P>
<P>
To accept his Culver City award, the debonair cat was chauffeured in a 1959 
pastel pink Cadillac convertible from the MGM/UA building kitty-cornered from 
City Hall. The 6-foot-tall, slender panther, dressed in black-sequined tuxedo 
jacket with tails, ruffle-front shirt and metallic silver bow tie, hopped over 
the car door, waving and landing elegantly on his watermelon-sized feet. "He's 
the Fred Astaire of cartoons," said Friz Freleng, 82, who created the cat with 
Dave DePatie. "He doesn't dance, but he's very graceful." 
</P>
<P>
"Pink," as he's affectionately called at MGM/UA, caused a stir among the 
residents who had come to the City Council meeting to talk about housing and 
budget issues. Councilman Steven Gourley read a proclamation calling Pink a 
"citizen of the world (who) has kept a special place in his heart for Culver 
City," while the rest of the council sang the Pink Panther song. Pink, his jaws 
fixed in a grin, kissed Mayor Jozelle Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The now-famous cat had humble beginnings, his name coming from the pink jewel 
stolen in the first "Pink Panther" film. 
</P>
<P>
Freleng, also a mastermind behind Porky Pig, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety Bird and 
Bugs Bunny, was asked by director Blake Edwards to fashion an animated title 
for the 1964 movie, in which Peter Sellers tries to stop David Niven from 
nabbing the legendary "Pink Panther" gem. Henry Mancini had not yet written the 
snappy Pink Panther tune, but gave Freleng a tempo to go by. "It was 7 1/2 
minutes long -- probably the longest title that was ever done" at that time, 
Freleng said. 
</P>
<P>
Pink "became silent because he couldn't talk over the title," Freleng said. He 
also became "a real egotist," pushing signs with his name onto the screen every 
time the credits to the human actors appeared. 
</P>
<P>
That first title led to other titles in the six Panther sequels. Freleng and 
DePatie also entered into a partnership with Edwards and producers Marvin and 
Walter Mirisch to make theatrical cartoons, such as the Oscar-winning "Pink 
Phink," shown before the features in theaters. From the 1970s to 1984, Pink 
Panther cartoons aired on networks Saturday mornings. Today, the cartoons can 
be seen on cable television in the United States. They are still aired 
regularly abroad. "There is no language barrier," Freleng says of his pantomime 
panther. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no sales barrier, either. The cat, at 25, has become a 
salesman as well as an industry in his own right. Worldwide, there are more 
than 250 licensees with more than 2,000 Pink products, that rake in retail 
sales of $300 million annually, says Mike Georgopolis, president of licensing 
and merchandising for MGM/UA. The company declines to disclose how much it 
earns in Pink Panther royalties. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, boys and girls buy hollow Ferrero-brand chocolate eggs, to find a 
surprise inside -- plastic pieces that they put together to make a 2 1/2-inch 
tall Pink Panther in cowboy, English bobby or one of 10 other guises. In 
Brazil, Pink is on television, pushing Batavo yogurt -- and those who buy it 
get a Pink Panther sticker with each carton. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, where a premium is put on Hello Kitty, Snoopy and other embodiments 
of cuteness, Pink has his own line of eyeglass cases and handkerchiefs. "OLs" 
-- office ladies, the Japanese slang for secretaries, clerks and other office 
workers -- can bring their lunch in sleek Pink Panther bento boxes that come 
with Pink Panther-adorned chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the United States, plush Panther dolls first came out in the mid-'60s, 
riding the success of the movies, said Georgopolis. Pink Panther merchandise 
has since exploded to include slippers, night shirts, beach towels, key chains, 
Christmas ornaments, notebooks, pendants and Hallmark cards. The Lange Pink 
Panther ski boot -- hot pink with Pink Panther at the heels -- retails for 
$450, according to Susan Notarides, MGM/UA vice president of marketing and 
operations. A 15-inch tall plush Panther sells for $25; the four-foot version 
goes for $120. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Pink graced boxes of Kellogg's Froot Loops. Since 1980, he has 
rolled out pink Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation in TV commercials. "We 
thought (he) would fit -- he's the same color as our product," said Fritz 
Lalendorf, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. marketing manager, who noted that most 
other brands of insulation are yellow or off-white. Peter Craighead of the ad 
agency Ogilvy &amp; and Mather, who helps manage the fiberglass advertising, 
said "sales have responded positively" to the Panther. 
</P>
<P>
Pink also prances at NFL games. In the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, he 
floats in the air, swinging a 70-foot tail and dressed in a floral-print 
bathing suit, inner tube and scarf. "Only the Pink Panther is silly enough to 
go out in November with this get-up on," Notarides said. 
</P>
<P>
The suave cat is a "cradle-to-grave" character -- like Mickey Mouse, he appeals 
to all ages, Georgopolis said. But Pink stands out because "he is known by his 
music, not only by his looks and his color," Georgopolis said. "The Japanese, 
Italians, Brazilians, the British, can all whistle the Pink Panther theme." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other stars, Pink balances his money-making with philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot "Pink Says Think" campaign on college campuses has such slogans as 
Exercise your mind, energize the body, and Refuse to abuse. The Panther appears 
as a poised, if not preppy, college character, with sunglasses, polo shirt with 
the collar turned up and vest. The message is that "you can be real cool, but 
think about it while you do it," Notarides said. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite part of this week, Pink explained in pantomime, is visiting 
children in Southland hospitals, where he wins them over by patting their hands 
or stroking their cheeks with a bulbous paw. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, he schmoozes at Ed Debevic's in Beverly Hills, at a fund-raiser for 
the Starlight Foundation of Southern California, which grants wishes to 
seriously ill children. Party-goers can bid for original Pink Panther animation 
cels, Pink Panther ski boots and other Pink paraphernalia and eat pink 
shortcake with raspberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Creator Freleng, said he had not envisioned Pink's success when the cat came 
out of "the end of my pencil." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that he's lasted this long," Freleng said. But, calling Pink a 
"magician and egotist" and "a sophisticated bum," Freleng said, "he's somebody 
everybody would like to be like -- in front of the screen all the time -- to be 
strong, to be able to push themselves to the front."

AGENCY RULES LOOSENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency has given its staff broader authority to award small 
contracts for projects without prior approval from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policies approved Monday, the executive director or assistant 
executive director can: 
</P>
<P>
Award contracts of up to $10,000 for landscaping, traffic studies, soil testing 
and other professional services. 
</P>
<P>
Award contracts of up to $5,000 for capital projects without going through 
formal bidding procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Get informal bids, without advertising in newspapers and in the community, for 
supply and equipment purchases up to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The top staff members may also authorize amendments in contracts that would 
cost up to 10% of the original contract amount or a maximum of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the director and assistant could spend no more than $500 without 
specific approval. 
</P>
<P>
The new policies are similar to those of other Culver City agencies, officials 
said.

BID TO THWART DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to discourage itinerant workers in the community, the Topanga Town 
Council has set up a telephone hot line for residents to report suspected 
illegal immigrants and the people who hire them, a member of the council's 
board of directors said. 
</P>
<P>
Board Member Pauline Rogers said residents were being asked to call 455-3000 to 
report incidents involving itinerant workers in Topanga, including the license 
plates of contractors and others who stop along Topanga Canyon Boulevard and 
elsewhere to hire them. 
</P>
<P>
She said the effort aims to reduce the number of day laborers in the area, 
several dozen of whom are said to inhabit primitive camps in the Santa Monica 
Mountains that pose a fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol officers arrested 41 illegal immigrants in Malibu and 
Topanga two weeks ago, although officials said only several were arrested at 
Topanga.

7 HEROES GET CHP AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven motorists who saved the lives of four people trapped in a burning car on 
the freeway will receive community service awards from the California Highway 
Patrol today. 
</P>
<P>
They are Alvin Daniels, 32, Rancho Cucamonga; Roger Middleton, 35, Alhambra; 
Raul Mata, 30, West Covina; Alfonso Alvarado Jr., 20, Los Angeles; Richard 
Marshall, 26, San Bernardino; Salvador Araujo, 37, Los Angeles, and Pete Mena, 
30, West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The seven were in separate vehicles when they witnessed a two-car collision 
July 6 blocking three eastbound lanes of the San Bernardino Freeway in West 
Covina, said CHP spokesman Trany Morton. 
</P>
<P>
They rushed to the accident and pulled five people from one of the cars, which 
had burst into flames, Morton said. The occupants of the second car had 
apparently managed to get out on their own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims died later of internal injuries. But Morton said the seven 
Good Samaritans saved the lives of Maria Godinez, 30, Pomona; her daughter, 
Yesenia, 12; her son, Rogelio, 6, and another passenger, Rosa Palamino, 15.

<P>
YMCA ASKS FOR BICYCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood YMCA is asking for the public's help in replacing $10,000 worth 
of bicycles and equipment destroyed in a Malibu fire last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycles, tools and helmets would have been used in the Hollywood Y's 
Adventure Trails program, which exposes inner-city children to nature in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We have these mountains that ring our entire city, and a lot of these kids can 
see them in the distance but that's about it," said Larry Shaw, director of the 
Hollywood YMCA Counseling Center. 
</P>
<P>
Each year between 45 and 50 groups and agencies, such as Youth Gang Services 
and the Boys and Girls Club of Venice, bring at-risk and developmentally 
disabled young people to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of children, many of whom have never seen more than a few trees in 
their neighborhoods, have gone on the bike rides, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
A loss of funding last year forced the program to shut down, but with a grant 
from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and a private donation the program 
was due to start again this month. 
</P>
<P>
The fire has left the Hollywood YMCA uncertain if it can resume the rides this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One organization, the Kiwanis Club of Hollywood, has pledged three bicycles to 
the group, but much more is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have 20 bikes to go, and a storage shed and helmets and a lot of 
equipment," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
At least $10,000 is needed to get the program on its feet again. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA is asking bicycle shops, corporations, businesses and individuals to 
make tax-deductible donations of money or equipment. 
</P>
<P>
If the program does not receive enough donations to start by the end of the 
year, it will have to return the grant money.

BENEFITS FOR YOUTH'S FUNERAL

Three restaurants and a gas station will host car washes this weekend to help 
raise money for funeral expenses for Anthony Cataldo, 16, who was shot to death 
last Friday night outside an Alhambra hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
Cataldo was apparently riding his bike when he was cut off by someone in a 
pickup truck. Angry words were exchanged and, a bit later, shots were fired 
from a passing car, said police, who do not think the incident was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Friday , from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Saturday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., friends 
and family will be washing cars for $3 at Arby's, 429 E. Main St. Also 
Saturday, there will be a car wash from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Mobil Gas 
Station, 1000 W. Valley Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, cars will be washed from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Pizza Pub, 1411 S.

CHURCH CONSTRUCTION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved construction of a Jehovah's Witnesses church in the 
city's Sunset Park area. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and one council member said the large turnout in favor of the church 
-- more than 100 supporters attended Tuesday night's council meeting -- helped 
sway their votes. The vote was 5 to 1, with Councilman David Finkel absent. 
</P>
<P>
The project was technically denied by the city Planning Commission in October 
because the commission cast only three votes in favor of the plan, instead of 
the mandatory four. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, to be built at 2119 Virginia Ave., will replace the Jehovah's 
Witnesses building on Pico Boulevard, which will probably be sold, a church 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
A small number of people opposing the church said it would create greater 
traffic congestion on narrow Virginia Avenue. Supporters, however, said it 
would not create significant traffic and would be a good neighbor.

PHYSICIANS BUY AMI-GLENDORA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of doctors signed an agreement to purchase AMI-Glendora Community 
Hospital from Beverly Hills-based American Medical International Inc. on 
Tuesday night, saving the hospital from imminent closure. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's 350 employees had been notified in September that the facility 
would close Nov. 6 if AMI could not find a buyer. When a deal seemed likely, 
the deadline was extended. 
</P>
<P>
"We're grateful that the hospital is staying open," said Bill Raymond, chairman 
of the board. "It's an excellent thing for the community." Glencom, a group 
representing at least 50 doctors, mostly on the hospital's staff, expects to 
close escrow Jan. 7, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Glencom had agreed to take over the 165-bed facility in the spring but was 
unable to finance the purchase then, AMI spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey said. She 
would not disclose the selling price. 
</P>
<P>
AMI then agreed to sell the hospital to staff physician Dr. Jesse Umali, but 
when that deal fell through last week, AMI resumed negotiations with Glencom, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Umali, who made a down payment of $100,000, said he expected staff doctors to 
support his bid but could not finance the deal when they did not. He would have 
paid $8.5 million, he said.

LANZA NAMED POLICE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Carmine R. Lanza, who joined the Baldwin Park Police Department as a 
patrol officer 18 years ago, has been named police chief by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Richard A. Hoskin, who was fired last week after three years on the 
job. City Council members blamed Hoskin for inaccurate figures that showed a 
greater decrease in gang crime than actually occurred and for failure to 
communicate effectively with his officers. 
</P>
<P>
Lanza, 41, had been acting chief since Oct. 9, after Hoskin was placed on 
administrative leave. The council appointed Lanza to head the 63-officer 
department last week. City officials said it had been a "toss-up" between Lanza 
and Hoskin in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lanza, who holds a master's degree in public administration from the University 
of La Verne, is president of the Baldwin Park Host Lions Club and is a member 
of the board of directors of the San Gabriel Valley YMCA. He lives with his 
wife and two children in Covina.

CITY CITED IN 'RAPE' OF MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monterey Park Mayor Patricia Reichenberger hit the nail on the head when she 
said developers "who are complaining about the standards are the ones who want 
to rape the city." (Times, Nov. 5.) There is no question that developers have 
been raping Monterey Park for the past 15 to 20 years, but the city should be 
held as an accessory to the crime. Loose development standards attract 
developers who, like anyone else, are interested in making the maximum profit 
possible. Very few builders will, out of the goodness of their hearts, provide 
more open space or off-street parking than is required. Proposition K was 
approved in 1982 because residents of the community had become fed up with 
wall-to-wall condominiums and unbearable traffic. 
</P>
<P>
An all-out moratorium is not the answer to Monterey Park's problems. Strict 
development standards, including lower densities, together with a Planning 
Commission and planning staff that are not willing to grant variances at the 
drop of a hat, would be a great starting point for a "get-tough" policy. 
</P>
<P>
I have no sympathy for the developers who claim that they are disillusioned, 
can't make a profit, or are losing money in Monterey Park. That's too bad, 
because it's safe to say the millions of dollars in profit were made in the 
last two decades at the expense of the city's residents, who now have to deal 
with the results. City Planner Margo Wheeler should not let the complaining of 
a few developers concern her. The overriding fact of Monterey Park's excellent, 
close-in location will attract other builders, hopefully some who are concerned 
with something other than making obscene profits.

The miles that separate Fukuoka, Japan, and Santa Monica seemed less formidable 
Monday after students from Oki Gakuen and St. Monica high schools met and 
discovered some common interests: music, sports, pizza and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just typical teen-agers -- just from a different place, a different 
part of the world," St. Monica senior Kathy Bailey said of the Japanese 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 students from Oki Gakuen High School in Fukuoka, Japan, spent the day 
at St. Monica High School in Santa Monica, getting a glimpse of student life in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
They toured the school, watched scenes from the school play, "Frankenstein," 
ate a lunch of pizza and submarine sandwiches, danced to the latest rap music 
at a "sock hop" held in their honor, and played volleyball against the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help broaden their eyes," said Toshiyuki Yoshinaga, an English 
teacher at Oki Gakuen. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, students from Oki Gakuen have visited St. Monica and 
other Catholic schools in Los Angeles. This year, 650 will visit 15 schools in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The students have to pay their own way, $1,400 each, but teachers on both sides 
believe that the experience outweighs the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"God knows we need more opportunities to create understanding between people, 
and this certainly does that," said Teresa Dickey, English teacher at St. 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Students who have taken Dickey's world literature class have read some Japanese 
literature. The day was a day of cultural sharing, Dickey said, and it was full 
of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to school from Monday through Saturday, 7:30 to 4:30," said Stephanie 
Teves of her Japanese friends. "That's wild." 
</P>
<P>
Masaru Tomohara, 17, seemed equally surprised to learn that schools in this 
country are co-ed. "I think its good. It looks fun," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to the United States was the first for teacher Yoshinaga, as well as 
the students. He was struck by the openness of the American schools, the 
open-minded attitudes of the students and the lack of formality. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things are impressive for the student, and they are going to remember," 
Yoshinaga said, adding that Japanese schools need to "move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting around a table during lunch, Stephanie got a quick lesson in origami, a 
Japanese form of paper art. Carefully following the motions of her partner, 
Masako Yamashito, Stephanie folded a small square of red and white paper. 
</P>
<P>
"See, it doesn't look like yours," she said, surveying her finished creation. 
</P>
<P>
Masako laughed, holding her neatly folded origami bird next to her partner's 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"She's laughing at me, . . . that's not a good sign," Stephanie said with a 
playful grin. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither group was adept at speaking the other's language, the students 
quickly learned to communicate. In place of words, they used hand gestures, 
head nods, and lots of smiles and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"When they get one on one, it's an international language," said Sister Cheryl 
Milner, principal of St. Monica. "They come away changed." 
</P>
<P>
Julio Quinteros, captain of the football team, said he had no problem 
communicating with his partner, Hidekazu Fujiki, 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's because he's an athlete too. We understand each other." Fujiki is 
a black belt in judo. 
</P>
<P>
David Martinez even got an opportunity to practice his Japanese. Under the 
watchful eye of his partner, Masaru, he carefully tried his hand at counting in 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Ichi, ni, san, yon, go, roku, shichi, hachi. . . . I always get stuck on that 
one," he said, trying to remember the Japanese word for nine. 
</P>
<P>
"Ku," Masaru reminded him. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's it!" said David. 
</P>
<P>
Later during the day, the rest of the senior class and others in school had an 
opportunity to meet the Japanese students at a dance and volleyball game. 
</P>
<P>
Rap music blared from the school auditorium as the senior class demonstrated 
the latest dances to its guests. 
</P>
<P>
Standing around in groups, the Japanese students seemed inhibited at first, but 
with a little coaxing from John McFarland, 17, some joined in, clapping and 
moving from side to side. The more adventurous joined a snaking line of 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"They adjusted so well. As soon as they saw their friends dancing, that just 
took the shyness away," John said. 
</P>
<P>
The underclassmen joined the seniors at a volleyball game and pep rally, 
complete with cheerleaders, drill team and class rivalries shouted across the 
stands. The Japanese students shed their school uniforms for sweats and 
T-shirts as the St. Monica students cheered, "Let's go Okis, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
The final score was St. Monica 15, Oki Gakuen 13. 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of the teachers, both sides were winners. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey said her students previously had felt intimidated by their Japanese 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
"They think, 'God, they're better in school, they do better in business, they 
can do so many things that we can't do," Dickey said. "But they're not 
(superhuman). They're just people like us. If (my students) learned that, then 
the day was successful."

WOMAN COMES TO U.S. TO FIND HUSBAND HAS VANISHED

It was supposed to be a reunion. Lucy Udo, 69, had not seen her husband since 
December, 1988, when he left their home in eastern Nigeria headed for Los 
Angeles. He had come to receive treatment for Organic Brain Syndrome, which 
causes symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease. Family members said he was much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was anxious to see for herself. 
</P>
<P>
But when she arrived in Los Angeles two weeks ago, she was told that her 
husband had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just in shock," said her daughter, Nkiru Ogamba. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Udo has been missing for nearly three weeks, and authorities have 
no clues to his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
He was last seen Oct. 17 in the 5500 block of 64th Street in Ladera Heights at 
3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ogamba said her father was not familiar with the area and had never left their 
Ladera Heights home alone. A worker in the nearby Ladera Heights Shopping 
Center said he believes he saw Udo walk by his store alone on the day he 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Before his disappearance, he had talked of going home back to Nkpologwu, the 
village of his birth. There life is slow, Ogamba said, and everyone knows 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He would say that he wanted to go back home. We had to explain to him and calm 
him down." 
</P>
<P>
Udo missed walks around the countryside and his family members back home, 
Ogamba said. He was scheduled to return to Nigeria with his wife next month. 
His disappearance has left family members "sitting on pins and needles." 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we are believing that today is the day that we will find him," 
Ogamba said. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, family members and friends search the neighborhood, hospitals 
and clinics for some sign of hope. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings the Ogamba home is filled with prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the oldest, and the biggest challenge is to be sure that the family is 
holding up. We pray together, and we talk about it. . . . That helps a lot," 
Ogamba said. 
</P>
<P>
The family fears that Udo's illness has worsened and that his loss of memory, 
coupled with a heavy accent, will hinder his ability to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray that he will be able to at least remember his name and any basic 
information," Ogamba said. 
</P>
<P>
Udo weighs 130 pounds, and is 5 feet, 4 inches. When last seen, he was wearing 
blue pants and a black and white sweater. He is 66. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are asking for the community's help. Anyone with information about 
his whereabouts should contact the Sheriff's Department at 974-4346 or 
974-4341.

BID TO RAISE FEES DROPPED

A proposal to almost double business licensing fees was withdrawn from the City 
Council agenda after nearly 50 business owners protested at Monday night's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After the city received about 335 protests from business owners -- who furnish 
almost 46% of the city's sales tax revenues -- the La Verne Chamber of Commerce 
requested that the council withdraw the proposal, which would have raised 
business license fees 75% across the board. The proposal would also have 
imposed license fees on operations conducting business in La Verne but not 
located in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to withdraw the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Sullivan, president of the chamber, which originated the idea, blamed the 
hostile reception on a lack of understanding of the proposal's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But many business owners said they thought that the proposal was an unnecessary 
intrusion into their operations. Others thought that its benefits would be 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have provided the funds for, among other things, the 
development of a high-profile image for the city, the scheduling of major 
promotions and the organization of shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the withdrawn proposal will be discussed at a meeting of the 
chamber's board Nov. 20, although no plans have been made for it to be 
reintroduced. 
</P>
<P>
In her statement to the council, Sullivan said she hopes to work with business 
owners who opposed the plan to develop a proposal that would be acceptable to 
all. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members and business owners raised concerns that some businesses 
would benefit more than others, but until last week little opposition had 
surfaced and most council members were amenable to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But a campaign organized by Dick Thompson, owner of La Verne Glass &amp; 
Screen, in which more than 250 preprinted postcards opposing the increase were 
sent to city officials, appeared to turn the tide.

LA CANADA ENDS SPONSORSHIP OF TEEN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE BAILIE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With little opposition from the teen community of La Canada Flintridge, the 
City Council voted unanimously Monday to withdraw its sponsorship of the Teen 
Center that closed last month at La Canada Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff recommended the closure of the facility, citing low attendance, 
insufficient staff, a lack of funds and community complaints over noise. 
</P>
<P>
No teen-agers spoke at the City Council session, and city officials said they 
encountered little protest from teens when the closure was announced. 
</P>
<P>
The city spent $11,330 on the center, which it viewed as "an experiment," 
Councilwoman Joan Feehan said. 
</P>
<P>
The center opened Oct. 1, 1988, and closed Oct. 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see it go, but obviously it has not worked," Councilman O. Warren 
Hillgren said. 
</P>
<P>
The council intended that a private organization would eventually take over the 
administration of the center, Councilwoman Joan Feehan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed it didn't get more support from the community. . . . The 
program really limped along. Nobody in the community wanted to take it over," 
Feehan said. "We're not big enough to run and staff a full teen center . . . , 
and the teens didn't seem to want it." The center was opened in response to 
community concerns that La Canada Flintridge teens "had nowhere to go," Feehan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the initial attention for the project began after an 18-year-old La 
Canada High School senior, reportedly drunk at the time, fell from a porch roof 
during a classmate's party and died as a result of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We did everything we could to fill a void in the community, and it just wasn't 
successful," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The program worked at first because it was new to the teen-agers and because 
staff members spent lots of time on the program, said Katy Duanis, coordinator 
of the city's Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Attendence continued to fluctuate, from 150 for dance events to three or four 
on nights when no particular program was planned. The average attendence 
hovered at about 20, Duanis said. 
</P>
<P>
The center's one-year history was also fraught with other problems, Mayor Pro 
Tem Chris Valente said. 
</P>
<P>
"It never really got off the ground to start with," Valente said. "It was 
originally intended for 11th- and 12th-graders and ended up attracting junior 
high school students." 
</P>
<P>
The center's original site was in the gymnasium at Foothill Intermediate 
School. It was moved in mid-January to an auditorium at La Canada Elementary 
School after attendence declined markedly, Duanis said. 
</P>
<P>
Property damage at the La Canada Elementary School site also detracted from the 
center's image with the community, Valente said. 
</P>
<P>
When it first opened, the center had a sign-in policy restricting access. But 
the regulation was soon abandoned to create a less structured environment so 
that more students might be attracted. 
</P>
<P>
One resident who lives across the street from the school said she is "certainly 
glad they're doing away with the center. There were kids running through our 
yard, some of them ripped a tree of ours in half. They threw fruit against the 
side of the house, and they trashed our front lawn."

LA CANADA DECIDES TO BUY INTO SEWER SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO PURCHASE SEWER CAPACITY FROM GLENDALE. IT'S 
THE FIRST STEP AWAY FROM SEPTIC TANKS AND COULD TOUCH OFF DEBATE OVER THE COST 
OF THE EFFORT AND ITS EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada Flintridge City Council voted 4-1 Monday night to negotiate the 
purchase of sewer capacity from the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The action could be the first step in the city's partial conversion from 
reliance on septic tanks to joining the Los Angeles sewage system. It promises 
to be controversial because of the cost and opposition in some quarters to 
development, Mayor Pro Tem Chris Valente said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement authorized by the council would allow 87 properties in La Canada 
Flintridge to be served immediately. The capacity would increase by nearly nine 
times in the coming seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of investment," Valente said. "We felt that we might not have the 
opportunity to buy into this later on." 
</P>
<P>
All but 6% of city residents and businesses now use private waste-disposal 
systems. La Canada Flintridge officials must now gauge community support for 
the project, since the city would have to pay for any unused capacity. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 businesses and residents in La Canada Flintridge have expressed 
interest in using the Glendale sewer system, Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which also would need Glendale City Council approval, calls for 
La Canada Flintridge to buy 0.09 cubic feet per second of sewer capacity for 
$242,500 a year. The city would then be expected to purchase additional 
capacity for $2,838,000 per year within a seven-year period, according to a 
staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Glendale would sell La Canada Flintridge some of its right to dump 
sewage into the Los Angeles system. The sewage would run through the Crescenta 
Valley County Water District to the Hyperion Plant near the Santa Monica Bay. 
Under the agreement, La Canada Flintridge would be billed for its share of 
capital improvements to the Hyperion Plant. 
</P>
<P>
The projected cost of using the system ranges from about $8,000 for a small 
home to $70,000 for a large business, according to Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
The city decided to reconsider the introduction of a sewer system after the 
Foothill Car Wash was ordered in July by the Regional Water Quality Control 
Board to stop dumping rinse water into a storm drain, Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the car wash can't be hooked up to the Crescenta Valley County Water 
District sewer system, it will be forced to close if it does not find an 
alternative disposal system. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings between the governments of La Canada Flintridge and Glendale have 
taken place since the city of Glendale first proposed the selling of sewer 
capacity to La Canada Flintridge in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal eight years ago allowed for the sale of 0.9 cubic feet per second 
for a cost of just under $1 million. In the current proposal that same amount 
has an asking price of more than $3 million.

GLENDALE PREPARES FOR FIRST WOMEN FIREFIGHTERS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: TESTING WAS EXPANDED TO FIND MORE MINORITIES AND FEMALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday approved spending $15,000 to remodel six 
of the city's fire stations to accommodate its first women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department will get its first two women firefighters early next year, 
part of a class now in training that includes the largest group of minorities 
ever to join the department. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the 21 recruits, 13 are members of minority groups or women, Chief John 
M. Montenero said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to hire more minorities, the department tested everyone 
who applied, instead of the first 300 as was done in the past. Chosen from 
among 2,500 people tested, the recruits include eight white men, one white 
woman, four black men, two Asian men, five Latino men and one Latino woman. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the department has consisted mostly of white males with some Latino 
males, said Sandra Houlemard, a personnel analyst, who was hired by Glendale in 
April to work on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
The recruits started their training a week ago and will join Glendale's 163 
firefighters on Feb. 15, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The money approved by the council will provide separate sleeping quarters and 
bathrooms for female firefighters at six stations, Montenero said. The 
department's other three stations already have separate facilities for women. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 recruits had to pass written, oral and physical agility tests, as well 
as a physical examination and a check on their personal background, a spokesman 
from the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department's training center is located at the Chevy Chase Public 
Works Yard at 541 W. Chevy Chase.

RUSHING INTO THE SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDORA'S BILL ZERNICKOW HAS MADE RUNNING A BIG PART OF THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE FOCUS HAS CHANGED FOR THE FORMER PASS-HAPPY TARTANS AS THE 
EX-FLANKER RACED INTO THE PICTURE THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before football season, the focus of attention at Glendora High School was 
squarely on senior quarterback J. J. O'Laughlin -- and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
After all, O'Laughlin was a preseason All-American selection and had been one 
of the premier quarterbacks in the San Gabriel Valley the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Glendora's running game had languished in the background. In 
Glendora's aerial circus, the running was merely a sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
But this season there has been a change afoot at Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
O'Laughlin is still a player in the spotlight for the Tartans, but junior 
running back Bill Zernickow may have stolen the show. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Zernickow has rushed for 1,128 yards -- third best in the 
valley -- and nine touchdowns in 159 carries to lead Glendora to one of its 
best starts ever at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the man most surprised about the development of the 5-11 and 185-pound 
Zernickow is Coach Dean Karnoski. 
</P>
<P>
"After last season we wanted to give the running back the ball more this year," 
Karnoski said. "We didn't know it was going to be him. We didn't know he was 
going to do the things he did to improve himself." 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow started as a sophomore flanker but gained more attention for his 
running. He rushed for 185 yards in 49 carries and caught 16 passes for 180 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't really a running back last year," Karnoski said. "He was more of a 
receiver-type back. I guess he's improved in his speed and strength. He always 
had the fluidness and the moves. But he went out and improved his speed and 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said a strong work ethic has been the biggest factor in Zernickow's 
marked improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good kid and a hard runner," Karnoski said. "He worked very hard over 
the summer and it's paying off for him. It's always nice to see kids who work 
hard and succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow credits much of his team's success to its offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive linemen are bigger and stronger and they've done a really good 
job," he said. "Most of the line has been playing together since they were 
sophomores. Any team that has a top rusher needs to have a top line to do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
In his case, Zernickow says, it has made a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
"You know when you run the football that they're going to open the holes," he 
said. "You just have to worry about the defensive backs." 
</P>
<P>
While Karnoski agreed that the offensive line has been a key element in 
Zernickow's success, he didn't play down the running back's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"The line has spent a lot of time in the weight room," he said. "Four of our 
offensive linemen have been together since their sophomore year. They're a good 
line but he's a good runner. He has done of lot of it on his own." 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow gave an inkling of his talent as a running back when he rushed for 
1,500 yards as a member of the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't receive much opportunity to run in his first season on the 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more of a once-in-a-while thing," Zernickow said. "We just liked to 
pass a lot more. When you have one of the top college prospects on the team (at 
quarterback) you might as well use him." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while last season did nothing to build his statistics, it went a 
long way toward strengthening him as a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was more of a learning experience for me," Zernickow said. "(The 
coaches) probably wanted me to get used to being on the varsity and grow a 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he is much better for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It has given me the experience to handle situation where I'm up against bigger 
people," Zernickow said. "I'm more sure about myself and what's going to 
happen. Last year I broke my nose in a game (against Don Lugo), so I know 
what's the worst thing that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
With his sophomore year behind him, Zernickow set out to improve himself during 
the off-season and spent a lot of time in the school's weight room. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm hitting the holes a lot better than last year," he said. "I 
also feel a little stronger." 
</P>
<P>
His coach said Zernickow needs more strength for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has to put on a little more weight and get a little stronger," 
Karnoski said. "I think he could work on his speed a little too. I think most 
good backs punish people, and he needs to get to the point where he punishes 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds, says he can improve his 
speed by competing in sprints for the school track team. He competes in the 
100- and 200-meter dashes and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial burst is pretty good, but I have problems switching gears and 
breaking away from people." 
</P>
<P>
Karnoski said Zernickow has shown that he has the proper mental approach and 
physical skills to develop into a major-college prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to improve but I think he can do it," Karnoski said. "He's a very 
hard worker and he's a tough kid. He can definitely become a college prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Although recruiting doesn't usually start in earnest until after a player's 
junior season, Zernickow has received a handful of recruiting letters from 
major colleges such as USC, UCLA, Oregon, Colorado State, Utah and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow has managed to keep this sudden attention in stride. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he says the attention has arisen from Glendora's victories. "It's just 
been a case of me being in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
He also said O'Laughlin deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't hurt to have a great quarterback," Zernickow said. 
</P>
<P>
No, it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
But, with Zernickow in the starting lineup, the running game for Glendora is no 
longer just a passing fancy.

AZUSA PACIFIC FACES BIG TROUBLE IN QUEST FOR .500 GRID SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific University can finish its football season at the .500 mark 
when it visits UC Santa Barbara at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
But getting past Santa Barbara does not figure to be easy, especially when you 
consider how impressively the Gauchos have played recently. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, an NCAA Division III independent that has a 7-2 record and has 
won six games in a row, has outscored its last two opponents by a combined 
score of 110-3. The Gauchos blasted the University of San Diego, 51-3, and shut 
out Menlo, 59-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (3-4) suffered a 24-6 loss to San Diego and a 40-28 setback to 
Menlo. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos also have the incentive of last year's game when Azusa Pacific won 
by 31-18. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest task for Azusa Pacific's defense figures to be containing Santa 
Barbara quarterback Steve Armstrong, who has completed 122 of 205 passes for 
1,587 yards and 17 touchdowns with only three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, starter since the fourth game of the season, passed for a 
season-best 425 yards and four touchdowns against Menlo. Santa Barbara's top 
pass catchers are wide receiver Brian Fleming with 52 for 706 yards, tight end 
Khaled Shahbo with 43 for 441 yards and wide receiver John Ace with 37 for 568 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific slipped below the .500 mark last week with a 21-17 loss to Cal 
Lutheran. The Cougars have been led by the rushing of quarterback Fitz Wilson 
and fullback Tommy Daniel. They have a good receiver in Kevin Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has been headed by linebackers Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner, the 
top tacklers. Another standout is defensive back Mario Riveros. 
</P>
<P>
The season will also close for several other four-year colleges from the valley 
Saturday. In 1:30 p.m. games, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (2-6) visits Pomona-Pitzer 
(1-6) and La Verne (3-5) plays host to Redlands (4-4), and at 7:30 Occidental 
(6-2) is at home against Whittier (3-5). 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will not be heading for postseason play, but the Tigers will have 
plenty of incentive against Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
First, a win would give Occidental the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference title for the third straight season. It would also help 
avenge a 26-16 loss to Whittier on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental was assured of no worse than a tie for the SCIAC title when it 
defeated Redlands, 21-17, last week. Whittier rolled to a 36-12 win over 
Pomona-Pitzer behind quarterback Mike Haney, who passed for three touchdowns 
and ran for another. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Hondo Prep of Arcadia has received the top seed in the CIF Southern Section 
Eight Man Large Division football playoffs that start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kares, who have a 9-0 record and won the Prep League title, will face 
Brentwood (5-4) in their first-round game at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
The only other San Gabriel Valley team in the playoffs is Pasadena Poly, which 
finished third in the Prep League and will take a 4-4 record into its opener 
against host Mission Prep (8-0) of San Luis Obispo at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The winners advance to the division semifinals Nov. 17. The championship game 
is Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific women's cross-country team, which struggled to third place in 
the championships of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 
last week, leads the way on the All-Golden State Athletic Conference team with 
three selections. 
</P>
<P>
The list is headed by Sonya Weir, who finished seventh in the district meet and 
qualified for the NAIA nationals Nov. 18 at the University of 
Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha. The other first-team selections from Azusa are 
Jenee Ellis and Sandy Belding. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific has placed three players on the All-NAIA District 3 second team 
in men's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who finished with a 6-9-2 record, placed senior defender Dean 
Miller, senior forward Ab Alvarez and freshman midfielder Mark Vaught. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was the team's leading scorer with nine goals and eight assists, and 
Vaught was second with eight goals and five assists. Miller scored four goals 
and had one assist.

CABRILLO MUSEUM STUDY TRIP PROVIDES EXCITING LOOK AT SEA LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum sponsored its first in a series of ecology marine 
study trips over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Fukuhara, the museum's program director, selected a group who showed 
interest in the study of marine life. The Shogun out of L.A. Harbor 
Sportfishing was equipped for a trip to Catalina Island with gear for observing 
marine activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun was just an hour out in the channel when four playful dolphins put 
on a show on both sides of the boat's bow. 
</P>
<P>
When the boat reached Catalina just before daylight, floodlights were turned on 
so everyone could see how squid float and are brought into waiting nets. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Ellis, marine diver for the museum, made dives and brought up many sea 
creatures and some kelp. He also surfaced with sharks he had baited, which were 
tagged and released. 
</P>
<P>
Traps brought up calico bass, perch and whitefish, all of which were released 
after studies. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuhara said more trips will be offered as part of a series he calls "Above 
and Below Catalina Marine Ecology Studies." 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the museum's tanks, holding many exotic fish, are available Tuesday 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Yarbrough of Torrance was first-place finisher in the 13th annual Dive and 
Surf lobster contest. 
</P>
<P>
He brought up seven lobsters of legal limit with a total weight of 45 pounds. 
The contest was sponsored by Redondo Beach Dive and Surf stores, which launch 
the lobster season opener every year in October. About 300 divers participated 
in this year's contest. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Charles Pfluven of Long Beach, fishing aboard the El Dorado 
on a two-day albacore trip, caught the whopper of the week when he brought to 
gaff a 46-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Thelma Sorenson of Carson, fishing at the oil rigs aboard the Hitless Miss, won 
the jackpot with a 29 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Chang Chow of Santa Monica, aboard the Spitfire, used cut squid to win the 
jackpot with a 24 1/2-pound Santa Monica Bay halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cox of Torrance, on the Sea Spray at Twin Roads, caught a 24-pound 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Chatelain of Carson, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Sportking, 
cinched the jackpot with a 22 1/4-pound yellowtail.

UCLA SOCCER TEAM WILL TRY TO REBOUND IN NCAA REGIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's soccer team, ranked 10th nationally after losing its last two 
regular-season matches, will meet No. 18 San Diego State in the first round of 
the NCAA Far West Regionals at 2 p.m. Sunday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said the playoff "matches the two top Division I teams 
in Southern California" for the third straight year. "It will be a tough, 
physical and exciting game." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins dropped to 16-3-1 after losing to South Carolina, 3-2, and being 
shut out for the first time this season by Howard, 2-0, in last week's South 
Carolina/Met Life tournament. San Diego State is 14-4-3. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's Far West first round, UCLA defeated the Aztecs, 2-1. In the 1987 
NCAA quarterfinals, San Diego State edged the Bruins, 2-1. Sunday's match marks 
the Bruins' seventh straight NCAA tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Against South Carolina, Bruin goals were scored by freshman Chris Henderson and 
junior Kirk Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's basketball team, with only one part-time starter 
and two reserves from last year's 32-4 squad, will open the season when it 
plays host to Pasadena City College at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Corsair Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Coach John McMullen's Corsairs advanced to the state tournament 
quarterfinals for the second straight year, but the only players returning from 
that team are 6-foot, 6-inch Mark Moton, a part-time starter at forward, and 
6-6 Chris Cook and Marc Schrobilgin, front-court reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a young team," McMullen said, "but they're hard workers who believe 
they can win and carry on the tradition established in the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen include former Crenshaw High School players Cornelius Banks (6-5), 
Chico Langston (5-10), Donald Smith (6-2) and two named Marcus Williams, one 
5-10 and the other 6-3. The taller Williams broke a foot bone in practice and 
is expected to be sidelined for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other first-year players are 6-5 Emile Bigelow, 6-1 Jason Shea, 6-4 Earic 
Peters, 6-5 Lincoln Hill, 6-6 Lamont Koonce, 6-5 Lamont Mitchell and 6-7 Jess 
Odom. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen expects his Corsairs to continue to play "aggressive, pressure defense 
and a fast-break, up-tempo style offense." Pasadena is always strong under 
Coach George Terzian, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Banachowski and his UCLA women's volleyball team clinched their 
second straight Pacific 10 Conference championship last week, their third 
conference title in four years, by defeating No. 7 Stanford in three games and 
No. 18 California in four. 
</P>
<P>
The victories gave Banachowski 601 career wins, making him second nationally to 
Coach Linda Dollar of Southwest Missouri State, who has 640. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (21-1 overall, 15-0 in the Pac-10 as the week began) will play host 
to Oregon State (11-13, 2-12) at 7 p.m. Friday and to No. 15 Oregon (19-6, 8-6) 
at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA freshman middle blocker Natalie Williams was named conference player of 
the week. She had a career-high 25 kills against Cal and 14 against Stanford, 
and she also had 13 blocks in the two matches. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's volleyball team (17-6 overall, 11-0 in the West Coast 
Conference at the start of the week) has clinched its third straight conference 
championship. The Waves will play Friday night (11-10) at Portland (14-12, 7-4) 
and Saturday night (11-11) at Gonzaga (17-9, 7-4). 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves defeated visiting Portland and Gonzaga, each in three 
games. Against Gonzaga, sophomore outside hitter Cari Delson had 10 kills, 
sophomore outside hitter Carolyn Hueth had nine, and freshman middle blocker 
Debbie Merandi had nine kills and six service aces. Against Portland, senior 
outside hitter Tami Seidenberg had 10 kills, and Merandi had nine kills and 
three aces. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Nina Matthies said, "At this point . . . we are playing for 
the best seeding possible at the NCAA tournament. How we fare in our upcoming 
matches against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Cal State Long Beach and San Diego 
State will likely have a major effect on our seeding." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 Pepperdine water polo team (22-4 overall, 8-0 in the Big West 
Conference) will try to clinch the conference championship and earn an NCAA 
tournament berth at No. 2 UC Irvine (21-5, 5-1) at noon Sunday. The Waves, who 
have won 16 of their last 17 games, will play host to USC at 2 p.m. Saturday at 
Raleigh Runnels Pool. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves defeated Fresno State, 13-6, and Pacific, 10-7, running 
their winning streak to six. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Geoffrey Clark leads Pepperdine with 76 goals, Sasa Poljak has 63 and 
Rafael Gandarillas 43. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder says five or six teams have a good chance of 
winning the NCAA championship, "but I can almost guarantee the team that is 
playing the best defense at the end of the season will win the national crown." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team (4-4 overall, 3-4 in the Western State 
Conference) will play host to Los Angeles Valley (4-4, 4-3) in a homecoming 
game at 1 p.m. Saturday at Corsair Field. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Corsairs snapped a three-game losing streak by shutting out 
Compton, 35-0. SMC tailback Charles McKinzie rushed for 173 yards on 21 
carries, giving him 1,065 yards in his career and eighth place in the school 
record book. 
</P>
<P>
Valley's strong running attack is led by Donald Dozier and Cliff Robinson. The 
Monarchs are coming off a 29-13 victory over Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's cross-country team will try to qualify for the NCAA 
championships Saturday in the District 8 championships at Fresno. The Bruins, 
who finished fifth in the Pac-10 championships, need to place first or second 
Saturday to get to the NCAAs on Nov. 20 at Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine sophomore Kim McElhinney, who won the West Coast Conference 
individual title in cross-country, will compete Saturday at the District 8 
championships at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's swim team (2-0) will compete Friday and Saturday at the Texas 
Invitational, while Pepperdine (0-1) will play host to Cal State Northridge and 
UC San Diego at 11 a.m. Saturday at Raleigh Runnels Pool. 
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the Pepperdine men's tennis team, led by freshmen Alejo 
Mancisidor and Matt Holt, will compete today through Sunday at the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn./Rolex District 8 championships at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's basketball team will play host to the University of 
British Columbia in an exhibition game at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Wave Coach Ron 
Fortner's team is led by three senior starters: guards Dionne Burgess and 
Sherri Murrell and forward Kristy Greenberg.

'ROYAL WATCHER' KEEPS TABS ON ALL THE WINDSOR RICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Queen of England is worth well over 2,000 times her weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly. 
</P>
<P>
In mere money, the 126-pound monarch, almost certainly the world's richest 
woman at any weight, possesses somewhere between $1.72 billion and $2.04 
billion. And -- here's the good part -- it's all tax free. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a good chunk of the royal private fortune derives from gifts, some 
dating back to the days of Queen Victoria, of jewels, land and hefty sums of 
cash from maharajahs, sheiks, sultans and subjects who show no signs of turning 
off the tap to the sovereign -- or her family. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates are made by Andrew Morton, professional "royal watcher," who 
traced the British royal family's private holdings -- in precious gems, 
estates, art, investments, race horses, automobiles, even a stamp collection -- 
to come up with what he claims is the best guess yet of how rich the royal 
family really is. 
</P>
<P>
Of course estimates of the royal riches are cranked out regularly, in what 
amounts to a mini-industry. Last September, Fortune magazine put the queen's 
worth at $10.9 billion. Other estimates have varied wildly over the years from 
a few paltry millions to as much as $26 billion, all of which Morton maintains 
are skewed by questionable motive or bad information. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this huge wall of secrecy surrounding anything to do with the royal 
family," Morton said in an interview in Los Angeles. "Everybody thinks they 
know everything about the Windsors. They know nothing. The often used image is 
that the Windsors live in a goldfish bowl. If it's a goldfish bowl, it's one 
that's been blacked out." 
</P>
<P>
Morton has laid out his stalking of the royal finances in a new book published 
simultaneously here and in Great Britain, where it was excerpted in a national 
newspaper and is due to be serialized in other publications. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the British Royal Family" is studded with 
the usual royal tidbits: a Canadian air force jet being dispatched to return 
Prince Charles' "beloved" crocodile shoehorn left behind on a visit to 
Winnipeg, the queen diverting her yacht so that she could mail a letter, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
But the core of the book is a cold-eyed banker's assessment of the origins and 
disposition of the private wealth that supports the House of Windsor. One 
chapter traces the development of the family's finances from Queen Victoria to 
the present, including deductions based on the limited evidence available about 
the current queen's stock portfolio, apparently brimming with mining and 
electronic issues and estimated to be worth $595 million to $680 million by 
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired somebody for two months who was a proper stocks and shares expert to 
look into this thing because their (the royal family's) stocks and shares are 
disguised by something called the Bank of England nominee accounts, which were 
set up by the government in order specifically to shield the queen's 
investments from investigation," Morton explained. 
</P>
<P>
The book's appendix includes an inventory of "known" royal jewels, estimates of 
land values and income from estates and other holdings, including a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory of Queen Elizabeth's private jewelry -- as opposed to the crown 
jewels and other property held in public trust -- includes a tiara last seen in 
public in 1911 with an estimated value of $600,000 and a 94.4-carat diamond 
valued at $9.5 million. The assessment made for Morton puts the total value of 
the diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls and sapphires at $60.6 million to $71 
million. It is a conservative estimate and does not include the market value -- 
up to 10 times or more of assessed worth -- that would be added because of 
their royal ownership, according to Morton. 
</P>
<P>
During his investigation, Morton said he bumped into a lot of obstacles -- laws 
that shroud royal investments in secrecy, uncooperative sources close to the 
royal family and the family's own fierce protection of its privacy. For 
example, since the time of Queen Victoria, royal financial advisers have taken 
"the secrets that they have to the grave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morton is the author of seven books about the royal family, a former newspaper 
correspondent who covered the royal beat and now proprietor of Palace Press, an 
independent news agency specializing in news and features about the royal 
family. But even for him, Morton admitted, much of royal life is unknown 
territory. Not only that, but the royals are protected by a "global myth 
machine" that further obscures the difference between royal image and reality, 
Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The royal family, like the best actors, put on a very good display for the 
public but in private they are very different people," he continued. "They're 
not everything that the public thinks. For example, the royal family today 
lives very much the way Queen Victoria did. Prince Charles, this man who is 
described as 'everyman, the crusading prince,' still goes grouse shooting with 
kings, dines with billionaires and millionaires in exactly the same way that 
Edward VII did a hundred years ago." 
</P>
<P>
One instance of royal obfuscation occurred in 1986 when a sapphire and diamond 
ensemble was omitted from the list of official gifts made to the Prince and 
Princess of Wales by the Sultan of Oman, Morton said. The ensemble, estimated 
to be worth $1.7 million and designated as a private gift, was only admitted to 
exist a year later when the Princess happened to wear them in public, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Morton theorized that this royal reluctance "rightly shows the embarrassment 
they feel" about receiving such lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the monarchy itself, the giving of gifts to the royal family is an 
enduring anachronism, Morton said. "I find the psychological and sociological 
aspects of it just fascinating," he said. "Why give to the richest woman in the 
world? . . . In a sense it shows that we're not really that far off from 
primitive tribes, that we live in a global village and that we still look to 
the equivalent of the squire on the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Morton contends, however, that the royal family will not always be able to 
protect its private wealth and enjoy unique privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In his book he notes, "The Windsors have shrewdly used the shield of their 
public duties to construct an armor of legal concessions, ranging from their 
wills to their shares, to deflect the arrows of outrageous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of fine judgment for the royal family -- and ultimately 
Parliament -- about how long their legal and tax advantages, secured by dint of 
their public role, can coexist alongside their increasingly vocal demands to be 
left a lone and treated as ordinary people. Ironically the very success of the 
Windsor dynasty may prove to be its undoing."

THE PROFESSOR'S 'PENDULUM'; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: IN HIS SECOND NOVEL, UMBERTO ECO FOCUSES ON MAN'S AFFINITY FOR GRAND 
SCHEMES BUILT ON DUBIOUS PREMISES.

<P>
It was a glorious Indian summer day in Manhattan, the kind that Umberto Eco 
ordinarily might spend roaming the city streets and drinking in the sights and 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
But these are not ordinary times for the portly, bearded university 
professor-turned-novelist, who created a literary sensation almost a decade ago 
with the publication of his first fictional work, "The Name of the Rose." 
</P>
<P>
His long-awaited second novel, "Foucault's Pendulum," has just been released in 
an English-language version by his American publishers, Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich, and his schedule overflows with the usual rounds of interviews, 
book signings, lectures, readings and receptions to promote the book. 
</P>
<P>
"My only pleasure is to obey my publicist," he said with a sigh during an 
interview in the sun-filled tearoom of the elegant Fifth Avenue hotel where he 
was staying. "It is a pity, because I am a compulsive walker." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the amiable expression on his face seemed to say, that it is a small 
sacrifice for the adulation he and his new novel are receiving. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, where the book came out last year, it sold more than 600,000 copies 
in the first three months of release and launched a new wave of "Ecomania." At 
one point, it was outselling its closest rival on the Top 10 list by about 100 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, in the space of three short weeks, it has already climbed to 
the top ranking in the Washington area and holds the No. 3 spots on the Los 
Angeles Times and New York Times best-seller lists. His book signings have been 
mobbed by eager fans, and his readings, lectures and debates have played to 
packed houses. In addition, his American publishers are printing 25,000 more 
copies of the book to augment the initial run of 250,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Along with its commercial success, the book has been greeted by overwhelming 
critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, is more pleased at all this than the 57-year-old Eco, who, 
until the publication of "The Name of the Rose" in 1980, was little known 
outside of academic circles in his chosen field of semiotics, the study of 
symbols and signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every author has two dreams," said Eco, who speaks fluent English with a 
lilting Italian accent. "One is to sell a lot of copies. The other is to have 
written such an important book that it is difficult to read. But to have both. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
There is no denying that his latest book is difficult to read -- in many ways, 
perhaps even more so than "The Name of the Rose." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it is 641 pages long -- almost 1 1/3 times as long as "The Name 
of the Rose." What is more, it has a far more convoluted structure and ranges 
in subject matter over what at times seems like the whole of Western culture, 
from Jewish cabala, the medieval Knights Templars, Shakespeare and Celtic 
legend to Karl Marx, Afro-Brazilian voodoo, computer theory and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
But in much the same way that he wrapped the medieval theological disputes and 
disquisitions in "The Name of the Rose" around a good old-fashioned murder 
mystery to hold the reader's interest, so he has plotted "Foucault's Pendulum" 
around a compelling adventure mystery. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, his presentation of the often arcane and abstruse history in the 
book is seldom dull or unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in describing the rise of the Knights Templars, a militant 
religious order established among the Crusaders in the early 12th Century, 
Casaubon, the narrator and one of the chief characters of the book, says: 
"Remember, the new kingdom of Jerusalem was sort of the California of the day, 
the place you went to make your fortune. Prospects at home were not great, and 
some of the knights may have been on the run for one reason or another. I think 
of it as a kind of Foreign Legion." 
</P>
<P>
Eco says the fascination his books hold, despite the difficulties they pose for 
readers, is easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many books that are adventures, in which someone is going through a 
forest, in which a lot of strange trees with exotic names are mentioned," he 
said. "You may not know the names or the shapes of the trees. But you continue 
reading because you participate in a sort of an agreement with the author. Now 
suppose that, instead of using nature, the author uses culture, as I do. The 
effect is the same." 
</P>
<P>
"Foucault's Pendulum," eight years in the writing, is the story of three 
editors at an obscure publishing house in Milan who get caught up in a hoax of 
their own making involving a supposed Knights Templars plan to tap a mystic 
source of power greater than any other known on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, they are hoist by their own petard -- in the case of one character, 
almost literally so. 
</P>
<P>
Eco says the book is a cautionary tale against a problem that has plagued 
mankind for centuries: the all-too-human passion for concocting some grand 
scheme -- usually conspiratorial in nature -- then, finding hidden meanings in 
the least little things to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Eco says, such intellectual machinations are relatively harmless 
-- like the 19th-Century literary tracts that sought to prove, through their 
eccentric interpretations of "The Divine Comedy," that Dante was a Rosicrucian, 
even though he lived hundreds of years before the mystic order's founding. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, however, the results of this "plotomania," as Eco calls it, can 
have disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
He gives as an example the so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a 
fabrication of anti-Semitic czarist Russians alleging a Jewish plot for world 
conquest that the Nazis used to help justify their systematic extermination of 
European Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The Protocols are a classic example of a concoction born of pure paranoia," 
Eco said. "They are a pure comic text, full of contradictions. You can't take 
them seriously." But this, he added, does not stop anti-Semites from continuing 
to accept them as Gospel truth -- or some close approximation of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Take the attitude of one Nesta Webster, a reactionary, anti-Semitic 
Englishwoman," he said. "She was mad but not stupid. She recognizes that the 
Protocols cannot be authentic. But, she says, that doesn't matter because they 
say exactly what the Jews think. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fundamentally fascist, this way of looking at things and continuously 
finding connections. Why are you wearing a red tie?" he asked, his gravelly 
voice taking a suddenly peremptory tone as he noted an interviewer's bright 
crimson knitted tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Were you a premature anti-fascist of the times of McCarthy? Are you a secret 
Communist? . . . You see what I mean? You can do anything once you start down 
that path of reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
In "Foucault's Pendulum," the three plotomaniac editors are started down the 
path when approached by Col. Ardenti, a former Foreign Legionnaire who sports 
an Adolphe Menjou mustache. He starts the ball rolling by telling them he has 
discovered a centuries-old coded message involving the supposed Knights 
Templars plan to harness the mystic power source. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the colonel disappears and is presumed to have been 
murdered. From then on, the story spins out in an ever-growing web of intrigue, 
deception and intellectual excess that eventually snares the editors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Eco says that the moral of the story is contained in every chapter in 
one way or another, it never seems more directly and eloquently stated than 
when Casaubon, the story's narrator, says: "I have come to believe that the 
whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own 
mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Eco did not know whether he had another novel in him after he had 
completed "The Name of the Rose," which has gone on to sell more than 9 million 
copies in 24 languages in hard- and soft-cover editions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to start writing from some personal obsession," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The obsession, in the case of "Foucault's Pendulum," came in the form of two 
images with which he had long been fascinated. 
</P>
<P>
One was the pendulum designed by the 19th-Century French physicist Jean 
Bernard-Leon Foucault to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. Eco first saw one of 
the devices 25 to 30 years ago hanging in a Paris museum, the Conservatoire des 
Arts et Metiers. 
</P>
<P>
The other image was of a scene out of his childhood in Italy during World War 
II, when he played the trumpet at a burial ceremony in a country village for 
some anti-fascist partisans. 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking about what could be in between those two images in a book," 
Eco said. "One year later, I started finding out." 
</P>
<P>
How precisely he fitted everything between those two images is evident in the 
book. The opening chapter finds Casaubon gazing upon Foucault's pendulum as he 
hides out in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. The penultimate chapter is 
a haunting lyrical one based on Eco's trumpet-playing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that cemetery story," Eco said with a wistful look in his dark eyes. "I 
have told it a lot to my friends over the years. Also, to many women to seduce 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has had several offers, Eco said that he has no intentions of 
allowing the book to be made into a movie because of what he describes as the 
risk to the novelist. 
</P>
<P>
"When the book is like 'Death in Venice' and the movie arrives 40 years later, 
there is enough distance from the book so that people won't make a comparison 
between the two," he explained. "But when the movie arrives too early on the 
shoulders of the book, there will be too many people who read the book through 
the movie, and this betrays the book." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added with a smile, "I don't think it's possible to make a movie 
out of 'Foucault's Pendulum' -- except to make a sort of Vincent Price movie." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, too -- although he prefers not to discuss it -- his experience in 
seeing "The Name of the Rose" translated to film has soured him on having 
"Foucault's Pendulum" turned into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for a book written as a caution against making unwarranted 
connections, "Foucault's Pendulum" has stimulated many a reader to try his own. 
</P>
<P>
Eco said that he is often questioned about the possible significance of the 
fact that the last names of the three editors start with the initial letters B, 
C and D -- Belbo, Casaubon and Diotallevi -- and that they are furthered in 
their scheme by three characters whose names each begin with the letter A -- 
Col. Ardenti, Signor Aglie and a computer dubbed Abulafia after a Jewish 
cabalist. 
</P>
<P>
"And another person has noted that Jacopo Belbo drinks a lot and that his 
initials are the same as a popular whiskey, J &amp; B," Eco said, dismissing 
such speculation as nonsense with a wave of his hand. "Once you start, as I 
said, you never can stop." 
</P>
<P>
However, he does not deny that there may have been some unconscious intent of 
which he was and remains totally unaware. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine once asked me why I chose the name Amparo for the Brazilian 
woman Casaubon has an affair with," he recalled. "'He said it was pretty 
strange because it's a Spanish name and not Brazilian -- a fact I note in the 
novel. He asked me if I had known someone named Amparo." 
</P>
<P>
Eco told the friend that he had once had an affair with a Latin American woman 
who served as the model for his fictional creation. But she was not Brazilian 
and her name was not Amparo. Only later, however, did he recall that when he 
was writing the scenes between Casaubon and Amparo, he would think of his old 
Latin American flame and how she used to played "Guantanamera" for him on her 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I remembered in one of the lines of that song there is a reference to 
a mountain called Amparo," he said. "So probably from my guts it came up in my 
writing. Did I have any conscious intent? No." 
</P>
<P>
Success as a novelist has not changed Eco much, although he finds celebrity 
consumes a lot of precious time that he would rather devote to writing and to 
his scholarly pursuits. He still teaches classes at the University of Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
But there are compensations -- like seeing his first book, "The Aesthetics of 
Aquinas," which was based on his doctoral dissertation, printed recently in an 
English-language version by Harvard University Press. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely true that I am happier of those 2,000 copies of the Harvard 
University Press than the millions of 'The Name of the Rose,' " he said. "It 
was the only one of my books that had never been translated because it was 
difficult. Even in Italy, the first edition was a small university press run of 
about 500 copies." 
</P>
<P>
Is there another novel in the works? 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible," he said. "One reason I started the second was to separate 
myself from the first. Otherwise, you become a prisoner to the book. It's 
possible that, at a certain point, if I feel too pressured by the 'Pendulum,' I 
will be obliged to start thinking about another story."

THE NEWLY MARRIED SIDNEY SHELDONS HONORED AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stretch limousines stretched out the driveway and down the block. The 
Rolls-Royces rolled in one after another. It was a busy night at Jimmy's, where 
author Sidney Sheldon was inside celebrating his recent marriage with his 
bride, Alexandra Kostoff Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were married Oct. 14 in Las Vegas in what Sidney Sheldon described 
as "a very private ceremony, just family, no friends." 
</P>
<P>
After a stay at Caesars Palace, they honeymooned in New England and spent a 
week reviving at La Costa. Now they're back in Los Angeles for awhile; their 
many friends, family and business associates had gathered Monday night to throw 
them a belated wedding reception, Beverly Hills style. 
</P>
<P>
A stack of crisply wrapped boxes and a bag from Tiffany sat near the door. 
Though the invitations had specified no gifts, a Beverly Hills wedding party 
without presents would be like . . . well, like a Beverly Hills wedding party 
without Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was there, of course, becoming the instant center of attention when she 
entered with her husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt. (Seems like just a year 
ago when Zsa Zsa's appearance at a party would be saluted with only a few 
perfunctory flashbulbs. Judging from the photographic panic that now ensues, 
Zsa Zsa is the Hungarian Madonna.) 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of other notables to look at, too. Creative Artists Agency 
head Mike Ovitz made a brief appearance and left quickly after congratulating 
the Sheldons and conferring with Marvin Davis, who was there with his wife, 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Also there: Sidney Sheldon's daughter, Mary, and granddaughter, Elizabeth; 
Milton Berle; Mrs. Morton Phillips ("Dear Abby"); Nancy and Alan Livingston; 
Lloyd Bridges; Anne and Kirk Douglas; Red Buttons; Jack Carter; Ed McMahon; and 
dozens of members of the Hollywood media. 
</P>
<P>
They and about 200 other guests had photos taken with the newlyweds and snacked 
from a buffet with fresh oysters and shrimp, meatballs, lox, fresh vegetables 
and other cocktail hour repasts. 
</P>
<P>
What's up next for the couple? 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to Europe," said Sidney, shaking hands with well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
Inveterate Sheldon fans also will be glad to know that his next hardback 
original, a sequel to "The Other Side of Midnight" titled "Memories of 
Midnight," is scheduled to be out within a year. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of prolificacy, the Sheldons should have their thank-you notes 
written in no time at all.

SOCCER'S BABE RUTH TAKES A BRIDE

<P>
A one-time street urchin named Diego Maradona chartered a Boeing 747 for a 
couple of hundred friends and came home this week to strut his riches before an 
adoring nation and walk to the altar with the mother of his two children. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona and his bride emerged exhausted at 8 a.m. Wednesday after an all-night 
wedding party for 1,100 guests in a run-down boxing stadium that was 
transformed for the event into a glittering reception hall, complete with 
caviar and glossy programs with color photos of the newly legitimized family. 
</P>
<P>
The world's finest soccer player thus fulfilled a promise to Pope John Paul II 
by legalizing his union with childhood sweetheart Claudia Villafane. Their two 
daughters, at times overwhelmed by the crush of guests, well-wishers, groupies 
and photographers, were there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
From Maradona's arrival in his homeland Monday through the civil and church 
services Tuesday to the all-night reception that followed, Argentina luxuriated 
in a spectacle of excesses. At a time of hunger and hardship, with bus and 
subway strikes paralyzing transport in the capital, nobody seemed to mind a bit 
of blow-out diversion. 
</P>
<P>
That is especially true for this most-favorite-son whose famed left foot, now 
in the employ of Napoli in Italy, carves legends worthy of Wayne Gretzky and 
Michael Jordan. Maradona, with his diamond studded earing, attracts adulation 
more usual for a Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The gossip magazine appeal of this confident, handsome, fireplug-shaped 
superstar recalls that of Evita Peron, another humbly born Argentine who also 
was prone to parade her finery and fame before an admiring populace. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, believed to earn about $2.2 million a year in a country where a bus 
driver battles to make $1,200, did not escape the controversy that has dogged 
him recently in Italy. He had arrived late for the first part of the Italian 
season, claiming that the Mafia was after him, missed matches, was fined $7,500 
for insulting a referee and is accused of punching a 5-year-old Naples boy. 
</P>
<P>
As the photographers pressed forward in a crush to shoot his arrival at the 
registry office here, he lashed out and landed a right on the nose of one, but 
inflicted no serious damage. With customary disorganization, police sought in 
vain to control the surging crowd of several hundred as the couple pleaded for 
respect for this "intimate ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Maradona Productions, which arranged the fiesta, did what it could to lend some 
order, issuing wedding press badges for the 140 or so reporters invited to a 
reception in the Sheraton Hotel, after the church service at the Most Blessed 
Sacrament Church on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona and Villafane relaxed a bit after the two wedding ceremonies. Chided 
for barring the press from the church and the gala party, Maradona responded 
with a smile, "I didn't come to your wedding. If you don't like it, don't come 
to mine." 
</P>
<P>
The chartered plane for 209 friends cost $500,000, the newspapers insist, and 
the whole bash a cool million. Some suspected that the deal with Italian 
television for exclusive film rights will cover most of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
Villafane wore an $8,000 white gown, with a glittering tiara and a train three 
yards long, covered with 20 pounds of semiprecious stones. She needed four 
attendants to help her move. 
</P>
<P>
As usual in Argentina, some things went awry. Maradona was told he had to pay 
$14,000 in customs duties before he could clear gifts, food and drink brought 
on the flight, including a Ming vase, crystal glasses, 30 cases of French 
champagne and 30 cases of Italian wine. 
</P>
<P>
But the 120 waiters hired for the party had plenty to serve. The cake alone was 
8 1/2 feet tall and weighed 330 pounds. There was smoked salmon, lobster and 
crab to start, followed by boned chicken. Fifteen baby-sitters cared for 
children in an adjacent gymnasium while guests danced to rock bands before 
straggling back to the 110 rooms that Maradona had rented for them in the 
city's best hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included former President Raul Alfonsin and his political foe, 
current President Carlos Menem, who played a passable charity match alongside 
Maradona a few months ago. But neither politician attended. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona led Argentina to a spectacular World Cup victory in Mexico in 1986, 
scoring five goals including the "Hand of God" goal against England, when he 
clearly touched the ball with a hand, unseen by the referee. His stunning play 
allowed an otherwise mediocre team to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet 30, he plays now with painkillers, and Italians grouse that he is 
off-form. But Argentines place their hopes in him as they approach the 1990 
World Cup in Italy. And they wait impatiently for his return -- after his 
Italian contract expires -- to his former Argentine team, Boca Juniors, in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The international soccer body, FIFA, said after the 1986 World Cup that 
Maradona was "the perfect football professional . . . crowned with exemplary 
fairness." 
</P>
<P>
The acerbic British soccer columnist Rob Hughes, complaining of Maradona's 
recent unruly performance on and off the field, said, "He might have benefited 
from discipline rather than sycophancy. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be too much to hope that, at 29, he will return (to Italy) with a more 
controlled marriage of talent and reason."

ART: LOUVER GALLERY GOES BICOASTAL BY SETTING UP AN OUTPOST IN THE HEART OF

<P>
Los Angeles' seaside art scene has made a splash in Manhattan. While Eastern 
galleries open outposts in Santa Monica, L.A. Louver Gallery of Venice has gone 
bicoastal. 
</P>
<P>
Louver Gallery New York, in the heart of SoHo, opened in October with a 
museum-quality show of sculpture from the '80s by Edward and Nancy Reddin 
Kienholz. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a trend? Not in the obvious sense. Los Angeles dealers aren't lining up 
to rent New York spaces, but the move indicates a growing tendency to think of 
"the art world" in global terms and not as a New York hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
As international art fairs assemble far-flung galleries under one roof and the 
art market becomes increasingly mobile, many dealers establish themselves in 
more than one city, if not more than one country.

Peter Goulds, owner of the two Louvers, and Sean F. Kelly, director of the New 
York gallery, talk about making European connections through New York and 
reaching across the Pacific from Los Angeles. Traffic will run both ways, they 
say, with Louver Gallery New York providing a forum for some Los Angeles 
artists while L.A. Louver continues to include British and European artists in 
its California program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the advantage of interlinking while running distinctive programs. This 
isn't a franchise, but we have more things in common than differences," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aficionados of L.A. Louver will find that the lineup of New York shows has a 
familiar ring: Los Angeles artists Ed Moses, Peter Shelton and Tony Berlant, 
and Britons John Virtue and David Nash. 
</P>
<P>
The Kienholzes, who divide their time between Berlin and Hope, Ida., are also 
better known in Los Angeles than in New York. Though they show regularly at 
L.A. Louver and have an enormous following in Europe -- a major exhibition of 
their work that began in Dusseldorf is now in Vienna -- this is the pair's 
first show in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Kienholz, who got his start in Los Angeles, hasn't had an exhibition in 
New York since 1966, long before Nancy Reddin became his wife and creative 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the long absence, people who really know, know about them. The 
response has been tremendous," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition of about two dozen sculptures, largely composed of flea-market 
foundlings, is prime Kienholz. A disturbing mixture of rage, criticism, 
empathy, hope and humor throbs through these artistic metaphors for aggression 
against humanity and nature. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grey Man's Parade," with a flag-waving, baby-faced man looming over a 
stag's head, raises issues about sending children to war and killing off their 
natural legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Claude Nigger Claude," featuring two life-size figures -- one caged as an 
elevator operator and the other as a businessman -- questions the impact of 
race, education and opportunity on social standing. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fast Walking Through Sparrows," a pair of sturdy legs plows through a 
forest of birds. "Septet," a particularly poignant assembly of dress forms and 
an old photograph of German girls, suggests that lost innocence is the price of 
youthful dreams and inevitable maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Such messages are open to interpretation, however, and each cast-off component 
is cloaked in its own ambiguous history. The resulting mystery allows the art 
to rise far beyond politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Kienholz show (through Saturday) has launched the new gallery as well as a 
remodeled building. Louver Gallery New York is currently the lone tenant in a 
handsome five-story structure at Prince and Wooster streets, but not for long. 
Tony Shafrazi, Victoria Munroe, Christine Burgin, Andrea Rosen and Luhring 
Augustine galleries and Petersburg Press will move in as soon as construction 
is complete. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Louver will be tightly embedded in the New York scene. West 
Coast art won't be its only L.A. connection, however. Los Angeles architect 
Frederick Fisher, who adapted an old brick building in Santa Monica to the 
needs of the Eli Broad Family Foundation's collection, has designed the 
6,000-square-foot gallery. 
</P>
<P>
He has married the existing structure with new additions, using an effective 
mixture of natural and artificial light. Subtly detailed themes include 
coffered ceilings and a cutaway form under a counter that echoes a volume 
projecting below one corner of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the building itself was formerly owned by Los Angeles developer 
Edward Broida, who had planned to use it for a private museum. Reportedly 
frustrated by red tape, Broida gave up the project a couple of years ago and 
sold the building to another developer.

The first Los Angeles Honors for lifetime achievements in the arts will be 
presented at the Beverly Hilton Hotel today to arts luminaries Eli Broad, 
Gordon Davidson, Ernest Fleischmann, Bella Lewitzky and Robert Wise. 
</P>
<P>
Every big city hands out arts honors "and it's time we got on that level," said 
Jacqueline Kronberg, executive director of the Los Angeles Arts Council, which 
is presenting the awards. The Los Angeles Honors replace the Armand Hammer 
Award, which the council has given to philanthropists for the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Visual-art recipient Eli Broad in 1984 used his personal art collection to 
establish the Eli Broad Family Foundation, which lends works from the last 
quarter of the 20th Century to 100 museums and university galleries worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Theater recipient Davidson is the artistic director of the Center Theatre 
Group/Mark Taper Forum and producing director of the Center Theatre 
Group/Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
Recognized in the category of music is Fleischmann, executive vice president 
and managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn, while dance 
recipient Lewitzky is artistic director of the Lewitzky Dance Company. 
</P>
<P>
Cinema recipient and director Wise has 38 motion pictures (including "West Side 
Story" and "The Sound of Music") to his credit, but Kronberg said he is being 
honored for his service to the industry, noting Wise's posts as former 
president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, former president 
of the Directors Guild of America and current vice chairman of the board of the 
American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley was originally scheduled for recognition in the community 
service field, but because schedule conflicts prevent him from attending 
today's luncheon, he will receive his award next year, Kronberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Each Los Angeles Honors recipient will receive a foot-tall crystal sculpture, 
designed by Kronberg, depicting the Los Angeles skyline, the ocean and a palm 
tree.

ABC CITES ADVERTISER APATHY, RATINGS IN CANCELING 'SOUP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's cancellation of "Chicken Soup" came not only as a result of disappointing 
ratings, but also because the audience it attracted, although large, was not 
desirable to advertisers, ABC Entertainment President Robert Iger said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that it was the highest-rated new series of the season, he 
said, the Jackie Mason sitcom was losing an unacceptable number of the viewers 
watching the show that preceded it on Tuesday nights -- the top-rated 
"Roseanne." Moreover, he noted, while its share of the total audience often 
dropped 11 percentage points below "Roseanne's," it was dropping by 17 to 18 
points among younger viewers in the key age group of 18-49. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a factor," said Iger, who met with reporters Wednesday to discuss the 
television season. He said the network considered the notion of moving the show 
to a different time period but decided against it because it was difficult to 
find compatible programs. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter suggested that "Coach" -- the returning sitcom scheduled to replace 
"Chicken Soup" on Nov. 21 -- had not electrified the world its first time 
around last season and might be a temporary programming measure. "We believe in 
that show," Iger responded testily. "I don't view it as a stopgap measure." 
</P>
<P>
But he later indicated that the ready availability of "Coach" likely played a 
role in its scheduling. Reviewing the status of ABC's mid-season backup shows, 
Iger said the network had four half-hour series waiting in the wings, none of 
which would be ready before January. 
</P>
<P>
Iger portrayed ABC, currently running second behind NBC in the prime-time 
ratings, as a network on the go. He cited statistics to show that the network 
is succeeding in attracting the "key demos," or demographics. ABC is No. 1 in 
attracting viewers aged 18 to 49 and viewers 25 to 54, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength is still in the younger demographics," Iger said. The network's 
advertising sales force is telling him, "Give us demographics, Bob," he said. 
In other words, don't worry about scheduling programs that will draw the 
greatest number of viewers, just get the right viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to another topic, Iger said he has little day-to-day involvement with 
ABC's new in-house production arm. Brandon Stoddard, the former ABC 
Entertainment president who heads the new ABC Productions, created a stir 
within the TV industry when he revealed several weeks ago that he was 
developing a program for rival NBC. Stoddard said he would keep information 
about that show, and any others he made for rivals, a secret from his ABC 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Iger maintained Wednesday that he doesn't know what Stoddard's NBC show is 
about.

A MUSIC MAVERICK FINDS HIMSELF IN THE MAINSTREAM

What a difference 22 years can make. Sixties renegade Gary Burton has become 
'80s mainstreamer Gary Burton. According to vibraphonist Burton, who plays 
Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach this Saturday night, his playing hasn't changed 
that much, just the musical climate around him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I burst on the scene with my own group in 1967, I was considered 
avant-garde, one of the first to combine pop with jazz before the term fusion 
existed. They called us jazz-rock. At the time, that was just what I heard, 
what I wanted to play. I've pursued the same model. I'm open to stylistic 
influences, but I keep the focus on improvisational jazz." 
</P>
<P>
"My rock heroes were Dylan, the Beatles, the Band. My jazz influences during 
the early years were Bill Evans, Jim Hall and the usual famous horn players of 
the day. As I got further along, my big influence over the years has been 
Chick," he said, referring to Chick Corea. Burton has recorded several times 
with that keyboard wizard, and the two have played together at least once a 
year for the past 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Burton also makes a cameo appearance on rock guitarist Eric Clapton's new 
album. The two met in the '60s when they shared a bill at the Fillmore in San 
Francisco, when Clapton was a member of Cream. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change in Burton's music of late has been the replacement of his 
pianist with young Austrian guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel. Burton returns to the 
powerful guitar-vibes combination featured in his '70s bands, with a string of 
guitarists that included Larry Coryell, John Scofield and Pat Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Don McCaslin is the third melody maker in the band. 
</P>
<P>
"With the three of us capable of handling melodies, and the guitar and vibes 
capable of handling chords, there are a lot of possible combinations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes Wolf and I accompany Donny, sometimes only one of us backs him. We 
also combine on melodies. We orchestrate different ways. The guitar and tenor 
share the melody line, or the vibes and guitar, or all three." 
</P>
<P>
Burton's latest albums include guitarists: a year-old recording with Scofield, 
and an upcoming release with Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
At 46, Burton knows himself and his music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very lyrical, melody-oriented player," said Burton, a prime player on 
the mellow ECM jazz label in the '70s. "I have no political messages. I'm not 
angry. I'm not troubled." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-pollination is blurring the lines between styles of music. Rockers work 
with jazz musicians, rappers hook up with rockers, and Brazilian flavors are in 
with musicians of all stripes. 
</P>
<P>
If the Yellowjackets are any indication, all this crisscrossing is expanding 
the musical horizons of the listening public. Originally pegged as a fusion 
band, the group has charted a jazzier course since drummer Ricky Lawson and 
guitarist Robben Ford were replaced three albums ago by saxophonist Marc Russo 
and drummer William Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
According to bassist Jimmy Haslip, one of two original Yellowjackets along with 
keyboard player Russell Ferrante, fans are are following the new direction with 
interest. The new album, "The Spin," hit No. 1 on the Radio and Records 
contemporary jazz chart, and is still in Billboard's top five. 
</P>
<P>
On "The Spin," the Yellowjackets opted for extended improvisations and simpler 
instrumentation more typical of mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been going in that direction for a while, but this is the first time on 
record," Haslip said. "We've always stretched out live." 
</P>
<P>
Haslip said the band recorded the new album, engineered by ECM genius Jan Erik 
Kongshaug, more like a mainstream jazz session. Songs were played live instead 
of built up instrument by instrument. Overdubbing was kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
So they should easily replicate their recorded sound when they play two shows 
next Wednesday at 7 and 10 p.m. at Mandeville Auditorium at UC San Diego. 
Sharing the bill is Stanley Jordan, whose unusual two-handed tapping technique 
turns a guitar into a veritable orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
France, known for fine wines and cuisine, has exported two other quality 
commodities this century: jazz violinists Stephane Grappelli and Jean-Luc 
Ponty. 
</P>
<P>
Ponty, who has thrilled listeners since the late '60s with his soaring, 
electric melodies, appears Tuesday night at Symphony Hall in downtown San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After learning the instrument from his violinist father, Ponty initially made 
his mark on albums with Frank Zappa and guitarist John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
On his new album, "Storytelling," Ponty uses an unusual five-string violin, but 
the sound still includes the slicing runs and arcing glissandoes that have made 
him the world's best-known jazz violinist. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Jazz fans should check out the "New Visions" program, carried Sunday 
evenings on the VH-1 cable TV music channel. Last week's show included an 
amazing solo composition from drummer Max Roach, plus music videos of the Duke 
Ellington Orchestra and Branford Marsalis. Unfortunately, subscribers to Cox 
Cable, San Diego's largest cable system, can't watch it, since Cox carries VH-1 
only between midnight and 6 a.m. The channel may go full time next year. 
Dimension Cable in North County airs the show at 8 p.m. Sundays . . . 
Saxophonist Barney Wilen, who played with Miles Davis, is featured on "Le Jazz 
Club" this Sunday night at 7 on KSDS-FM (88.3). . . . Host Erin Searles dishes 
up blues Saturday nights from 9 to 11 on KPBS-FM (89.5). . . . Next Wednesday's 
"Jazz Trax" concert at the Catamaran features Freeway Philharmonic.. . . Most 
Valuable Players plays this Friday and Saturday night at the B Street Cafe 
&amp; Bar in downtown San Diego.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Fleming bent down to rub some leaves from one of her short sage plants, 
leaving a mint-like scent on her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just smell that. In the morning and at night, with the dew, there's just a 
beautiful, beautiful aroma," Fleming said of the small garden surrounding her 
Belmont Shore home. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's garden is healthy and green and aromatic. Her plants have thrived 
despite the fact that the last time she watered them was on Labor Day, and the 
next time she waters will be June of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach resident has a "xeriscape," an increasingly popular type of 
garden that combines various landscaping principles aimed at conserving water. 
</P>
<P>
In Greek, the word xeros means dry. But that does not translate to a bunch of 
cacti, tumbleweeds and rocks, xeriscape enthusiasts quickly point out. 
</P>
<P>
In Fleming's garden, for example, there are drought-resistant plants with red, 
purple and blue flowers that need only occasional watering and are more 
suitable to the desert-like climate of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It is a concept that is catching on in cities such as Los Angeles and Santa 
Monica, where officials adopted xeriscape ordinances last year, and in Irvine 
and other parts of southern Orange County, where new developments feature 
better irrigation methods, mulches and plants that need less water. 
</P>
<P>
But in places such as Long Beach, city officials do little to educate people 
about the option of xeriscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some cities have done nothing at all," said Phil Hitchcock of the Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California. "Long Beach, for example, has no 
requirements that I'm aware of. I was not able to find anything for Anaheim and 
Fullerton, either. (Such cities) encourage low-water use plants, but it's more 
lip service than a requirement." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ehren of the Long Beach Water Department acknowledged that "it's 
something we could do more of." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say that Long Beach is not doing anything," said Ehren, the 
department's safety and training officer. He noted that the city has an 
emergency water conservation plan that would go into effect in the event of a 
drought, and officials have also promoted water conservation in restaurants and 
through garden shows. In addition, the city has a xeriscape garden around its 
own Water Department building at 1800 E. Wardlow Road. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not through the city that Fleming heard of xeriscapes. Earlier this 
year, the retired schoolteacher received a visit -- and a lesson in water 
conservation -- from John Griffith, a former student who is now a wildlife 
biologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes absolutely no sense to plant anything that was not there to begin 
with," Griffith said from his home in Michigan. "Everything that happens in her 
native garden will keep everything under control." For example, fleas, ants and 
snails will stay away because they don't like to eat native California plants, 
Griffith explained. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have native plants, which are the pyramid of wildlife, you'll attract 
native animals, like butterflies and lizards and hummingbirds," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a xeriscape is to use landscape designs and plants that fit the 
natural environment. Using mulch, for example, keeps soil moist and reduces 
watering and evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
The right kind of sprinkler can also make a difference, said Hitchcock, the 
principal analyst in the water district's conservation management division. A 
drip or trickle irrigation system using narrow, porous tubes that slowly soaks 
plants' roots can cut water use by 20% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, about 50% of the average household's water bill is 
spent on watering outdoor landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is a finite source that will become increasingly expensive as we face 
droughts," said Jim Van Haun, a spokesman for the Orange County Water District. 
Most of the xeriscape push in Orange County is toward the south, where most of 
the new development is taking place, Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Water District of Orange County, the primary importer of water 
for the county, has sponsored for the last eight years an annual xeriscape 
conference, which attracts several hundred landscape architects, contractors, 
irrigation specialists, gardeners and homeowners, according to a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where city officials adopted a comprehensive ordinance last 
year in hopes of conserving water, new developments must submit landscaping 
plans that meet a xeriscape point system, said John Stodder, the environmental 
affairs adviser to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Monica also adopted a xeriscape ordinance last year affecting 
new commercial and multifamily construction that includes landscaping. The new 
law limits lawn area to 20% of the landscaping, urges grouping plants with 
similar water needs together and calls for the use of water-conserving plants 
and efficient irrigation systems, said Atossa Soltani, the city's water 
conservation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Santa Monica City Hall there are three such gardens, which Soltani 
said cost no more to plant than a regular garden but save the city money in 
both water and maintenance. Several times a year, busloads of visitors gather 
at City Hall and then tour homes with xeriscape gardens in a city-sponsored 
tour, Soltani said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Welsh, president-elect of the National Xeriscape Council, said he has not 
had to do much to promote the idea of planting a garden that saves water and 
work. In 1978, there was only one educational program in the country promoting 
xeriscapes. Today, such programs exist in 36 states, Welsh said from his office 
in College Station, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even have to try to sell it. It's selling all over the nation," Welsh 
said. "Xeriscape is beautiful landscaping. Xeriscape, to me, will one day 
replace the word landscape."

SOLIS, GONTHIER WIN REELECTION TO RIO HONDO BOARD

<TEXT>
<P>
After a bitterly fought campaign that included a scathing "hit" letter, the 
voters in the Rio Hondo College District have returned incumbents Hilda Solis 
and Isabelle Gonthier to the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also selected Barbara Stone, a conservative political science professor, 
to fill the seat vacated by Marilee Morgan, who retired after serving on the 
board for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some college officials said the races for district seats in Whittier, El Monte 
and South El Monte were the most competitive in recent memory, fueled partially 
by the controversy over last year's change of presidents at the college, which 
split the five-member board. Nine candidates were seeking election. 
</P>
<P>
The winners have pledged to reunite the board, but some college sources say 
privately that they expect the bickering to continue, with Gonthier and Solis 
in a struggle against Trustees Ralph Pacheco and Bill E. Hernandez. Stone, who 
was supported by Morgan, is seen as the swing vote on the board. Stone has been 
critical of the trustees' decision not to renew Herbert Sussman's contract as 
president last year, but supportive of the decision to hire Alex Sanchez as 
Sussman's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign reached the boiling point early this week, when a letter attacking 
Solis was sent to voters in El Monte and South El Monte. The letter, typed on 
official college stationery by a group claiming to be the "staff committee for 
ethical elections," accused Solis of living outside the district and 
associating with a convicted child-molester, among other things. Solis denies 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
College President Sanchez has asked Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner to investigate the 
matter. "The letter is written on Rio Hondo letterhead and represents that it 
is official business of the district," Sanchez wrote in a letter to Reiner. 
"This is absolutely not true, and thereby constitutes an intentional 
misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
In the last days of campaigning, Solis and her supporters walked door-to-door 
to deny the allegations. On the eve of the election, Solis said she was worried 
she had lost the race because of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
But Solis' race was never close. She won 45.7% of the vote. David Flores, who 
received encouragement from Hernandez and Pacheco, finished second, with 35.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the letter had some effect on the election, but there were a lot of 
people who hung in there with us," Solis said. "I'm anxious to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
In Area 3, which includes parts of Whittier, incumbent Gonthier beat newcomer 
Ceci Medina to win a third term. 
</P>
<P>
In Area 5, which also includes parts of Whittier, Stone easily defeated her 
four opponents. Stone, a well-known figure in Whittier for 17 years, has run 
before for State Assembly seats, but has lost. The Cal State Fullerton 
professor is a member of the state Little Hoover Commission and other 
committees dedicated to improving education. Attorney Louis Caldera, who 
launched a well-financed campaign with $20,000 in donations, finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said she is anxious to stop the board's bickering and improve the image 
of the college by spending more time in the community promoting programs. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the board, has been split on several issues. 
</P>
<P>
The problems started when Trustees Ralph Pacheco, Bill E. Hernandez and Solis 
voted not to renew President Herbert Sussman's contract for the 1989-90 school 
year, even though Sussman had announced that he planned to retire anyway in 
June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
They said they did not like Sussman's leadership style. Gonthier and Morgan 
disagreed and voted to retain Sussman. 
</P>
<P>
Another spit developed over the selection of Sussman's successor. Pacheco and 
Hernandez favored a candidate from east Los Angeles, but Solis joined Gonthier 
and Morgan to hire Alex Sanchez, former vice president at the University of New 
Mexico in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco and Hernandez told Gonthier and Solis that their decision to hire 
Sanchez could cost them the election. They said the community wanted a local 
president, not someone from outside the state, and the votes would prove it. At 
the beginning of the campaign, Pacheco criticized Gonthier and Solis for their 
decision to hire Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the residents of the district) had been saying, 'If you are going to 
hire someone, hire someone who knows our community, who understands the 
community college district,' " Pacheco said. "It was an opportunity as a 
community to promote within our community." 
</P>
<P>
Solis said she sees her victory as a vote of confidence for Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
"He can now move forward and make the changes and improvements necessary at the 
college without having to worry," Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco said he wants to put the hard feelings in the past, but said he expects 
the board to continue to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you have bodies of two or more, there are going to be differences of 
opinion," Pacheco said. "But I'm looking forward, with no hard feelings. I see 
a new era here."

VOTERS DEFEAT MOVE TO GIVE LATINOS BETTER CHANCE AT COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters narrowly defeated a proposal to divide the Cerritos Community College 
District into seven trustee areas to give Latinos a better chance of being 
elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the voters, or 6,691, were against Proposition B, while 5,349 
voted for it. Four incumbents retained their seats on the Cerritos College 
Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Trustes will continue to be chosen at large from throughout the district, which 
serves Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, La Mirada, 
Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs and parts of Lakewood, Long Beach and South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
During a February meeting, the board voted 4 to 3 in favor of creating seven 
trustee areas, which were expected to increase representation of ethnic 
minorities, especially Latinos, on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Durant, 38, who was reelected for a second term, opposed the proposition. 
He said that raising the ethnic issue was "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong for one nationality to be favored over another group," he said. 
"It was set up and addressed to a certain group. I think it's garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad, very glad that the public saw it for what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those calling for redistricting have argued that Latinos, the largest 
minority in the district, have been inadequately represented in the past and 
that the new plan would increase the likelihood of a Latino trustee being 
elected by largely Latino communities such as Hawaiian Gardens. The board has 
one Latino member, Ruth Banda. 
</P>
<P>
"Our opponents made it look like we were dividing along ethnic lines," said 
Banda, "but we were just being sensitive to the community and trying not to 
intentionally divide it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to give areas more local control over selection of trustees, 
and redistricting was the best way to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she regrets that proponents didn't do a better job of providing more 
detail and background on Proposition B. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stits, 52, who was reelected, said the issue will resurface. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the issue will come back soon, maybe in four years. It is not a dead 
issue at all," said Stits, who was appointed to the board in January. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee John Moore, who was reelected to the board, was against the proposal, 
because there was not enough information on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the present makeup of the school board, Stits said he's not 
convinced that redistricting would increase the number of minorities on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Several other community college districts have trustee areas, including Rio 
Hondo, Pasadena and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's election, all four incumbents were victorious, including Ada 
Steenhoek, 50.

LYNWOOD PUTS 2 INCUMBENTS ON COUNCIL, ADDS LATINO; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE RACE WAS MARKED BY CHARGES THAT RACISM WAS BEHIND CHANGING NAME 
OF CENTURY BOULEVARD TO MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. BOULEVARD.

<P>
Two black incumbents held on to their jobs and for the first time a Latino was 
elected to the five-member City Council in a race marked by charges that racism 
was behind the renaming of Century Boulevard in honor of slain civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Evelyn Wells and Mayor Pro Tem Paul H. Richards were reelected to second 
four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Rea, who ran on a slate with two other Latinos, finished third, 
capturing the seat left vacant by retiring veteran Councilman E. L. Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Richards received the most votes in the race by 12 candidates for three seats, 
Wells was the next highest vote-getter, followed by Rea. 
</P>
<P>
The two others on the Latino slate, Emma Esparza and Alberto Penalber, finished 
a close fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a good fight. We didn't lose by too much. I'm just happy one of us 
won," Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wells and Richards expressed relief that they had taken an early Tuesday 
night lead away from Rea, Esparza and Penalber. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel much better now," Richards said during a victory party at his home. 
</P>
<P>
All of the winners said they would be willing to work with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"As the new kid on the block I went to them and congratulated them," said Rea, 
30, a county sheriff's detective specializing in burglary and stolen automobile 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
With all 12 precincts reporting, Richards finished with 1,119 votes, Wells got 
1,110, Rea, 1,043 and Esparza, 944 while Penalber received 822. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over changing the name of a portion of Century Boulevard to Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard generated charges and countercharges early in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Black council members said they were accused of racism after they voted to 
change the name. 
</P>
<P>
In the waning moments of the campaign, candidate Benjamin R. Miranda, a black, 
accused the Latino coalition of running "a blatant racist campaign" because of 
a last-minute mailer. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer by Latin Americans Together, supported Rea, Esparza and Penalber and 
stated that there were no Latinos on the five-member council even though more 
than 45% of the city's 50,000 population is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer, which displayed numerous flags of Latin American countries, asked 
voters to elect Esparza, Rea and Penalber as well as Lynwood school board 
candidate Rachel Chavez and school board incumbent Helen Andersen, an Anglo. 
Chavez was elected and Andersen defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Rea denied running a racist campaign. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it was important that a Latino be on the council to 
represent the varied Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Both Esparza and Penalber denied that their tactics in the campaign were 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing racist about wanting to get Latinos elected to the council. 
Blacks supported each other in this campaign. No one is calling it racism," 
Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Wells said: "I see this (the Latino campaign) as racism. It is a shame 
they had to resort to this. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a multiracial community and we should be supporting harmony." She said 
she would be willing to work with Rea. "I hope he will be willing to work with 
the entire community, not just the Latino community," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said he welcomed a Latino on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"It is about time. It is long overdue," Richards said. The 33-year-old Richards 
was elected to the council in 1986 to serve out the unexpired term of Louis 
Thompson, a councilman who died in office. 
</P>
<P>
As for the renaming of the street, both Wells and Richards said they would not 
do anything differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some people disagreed with the street renaming but I think people 
looked beyond the street controversy. My record won for me," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rea said the street issue should have been put on the ballot to allow 
citizens a chance to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Martin Luther King was a great man, but he probably would not have 
supported using $40,000 to name a street after him, " Rea said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the street renaming, Esparza and Penalber launched an unsuccessful 
recall attempt against Wells, Richards and Councilman Robert Henning. All three 
had voted for the street renaming. 
</P>
<P>
Wells and Richards had called the recall attempt, that was abandoned before 
petitions were circulated, a publicity stunt to help Esparza and Penalber in 
their political campaigns.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL VOTES TO RECOGNIZE UNION FOR CITY EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As of this week, employees of Hawaiian Gardens are being represented by a labor 
union. The City Council voted at a special meeting Monday to recognize the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees as the bargaining 
agency for city workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a union here before," City Manager Ron Downing said. "I think 
it's a positive step in the right direction in terms of improving 
employee-employer relations." 
</P>
<P>
The city has 31 full-time employees, although those in management positions 
will not be union members. There are no fire and police employees in the city. 
Those services, as well as some building inspection and health services, are 
provided under a contract with Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The first negotiating session between the city and the union, Downing said, is 
expected to be next week. A pay increase is likely to be at the top of the 
agenda. "I would expect they will expect one," Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city experienced a severe budget crunch last year, employee 
salaries have been frozen.

Photo, All the Fun of Flight Without the Noise Unlike other neighborhoods of 
Long Beach where battles are waged over aircraft noise, all is quiet at this 
small launching and landing strip near the beach. There are no jet engines to 
roar upon takeoff, no high-pitched whines upon landing approaches. These are 
gliders that fly out of Bluff Park on Ocean Boulevard near Redondo Avenue, 
where onshore breezes and street traffic make far more noise than the aircraft. 
A pilot, top, watches his radio-controlled glider cruise past a recent weekend 
panorama of ocean ships and harbor cranes. Zachary Schuster launches his glider 
by hand into a strong wind. The beach bicycle path runs below the bluff, 
offering a temptation for pilots to buzz unsuspecting cyclists. BARRETT STINSON

LEGENDARY WALKING VIOLIN MINSTREL DIES AT AGE 76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elston Johnson, the "Violin Man" who wandered the streets of Whittier for 
nearly 25 years playing lively tunes on his fiddle, has died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson died Sunday afternoon at his home after suffering from a prolonged 
illness, said Gladys French, Johnson's caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
Visitations for the fiddler will be held from 2 to 8 p.m. today at White 
Emerson Funeral Home, 13304 E. Philadelphia St., Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a kind and gentle-mannered fellow who looked a little like Santa Claus 
with his long white beard, had become a legend in Whittier. When Johnson was 
younger he walked between 10 and 25 miles a day through Whittier, playing his 
fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson became ill several months ago, French and her husband, Paul, 
would drive Johnson to a park or street corner where he could play his carefree 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, also known as the "Whittier Walker," said during an interview in 
September that he put on the impromptu concerts because he loved music and 
fresh air.

LACK OF FRUIT FLY EVIDENCE EASES CONCERN ON QUARANTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County agriculture officials this week reported no new findings of the 
Oriental fruit fly, easing concerns about the possibility of a quarantine on 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The fly, found for the first time two weeks ago on Ventura County's west end, 
sent alarm through the farming community because of its potentially devastating 
effects on citrus, avocados, strawberries and other fleshy fruits. 
</P>
<P>
But even with 920 traps set countywide, no new flies have been captured since 
Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have traps out, and they are checking them every day for a while 
yet," said Ken Weiss, deputy agricultural commissioner. "But that's mostly a 
precaution." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said the increased findings of the Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles 
County concerns growers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you get down in L.A., the more likely it is that they'll pop up up 
here," Weiss said.

EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your recent article about a demonstration at Procter &amp; Gamble over the 
increased use of dogs and ferrets in animal testing for their products, it was 
implied that the Oxnard Republican Women's group was involved in the protest. 
This is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Republican Women have not taken a stand and did not take a stand on 
that day on the company's activities. 
</P>
<P>
The implication mentioned above was derived by a reporter asking what groups 
and organizations I was affiliated with. I am vice president, not president, of 
Oxnard Republican Women; I will be installed as president on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
And, although as its newly installed president I may be working next year on 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock's reelection campaign, I am not individually in 
charge of it. 
</P>
<P>
All those involved in the demonstration appreciate the Times' coverage of our 
effort to alert the public to the unnecessary and cruel use of animals in 
product testing.

ORDERS TO REMOVE SANTA PAULA PLAYER CAUSE COMMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula High coaches are still upset about the events surrounding the 
removal of Freddie Torrez from Saturday's 35-21 loss to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began because Dr. Michael Huff removed Torrez from the game 
because he felt the player was in danger of rupturing his spleen. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula coaches were unaware that Huff was the game physician and 
questioned his authority to remove Torrez. 
</P>
<P>
Torrez, who starts at outside linebacker and fullback, had complained about 
pain in his side after getting hit numerous times during the first half. 
Torres, however, did not believe he had suffered a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guy comes running out on the field and says Torrez has to come out," 
Santa Paula Coach Mike Tsoutsouvas said. "I told him he's not hurt. The guy 
goes crazy and starts yelling at us that he's the game doctor. We don't even 
know who he is. He was wearing a Santa Clara jacket and he never identified 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Tsoutsouvas said he had his player examined by another doctor before Torrez was 
allowed to continue to play in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Huff, who works as a family physician in Oxnard, said he didn't see Torrez get 
hurt in the first half, but was asked for advice about the player's condition. 
Huff said he later witnessed Torrez get hit a half-dozen more times in the side 
during the second half and felt that Torrez could have been suffering from a 
ruptured spleen. 
</P>
<P>
"By the way he was grabbing his side, I had reason to believe that if he played 
further, he could suffer a significant injury," Huff said. "I also felt that it 
was possible that nothing was wrong. But it wasn't worth the risk. He was taken 
out of the game at my request." 
</P>
<P>
Huff admitted, however, he should have handled the situation in a more 
professional manner. "The situation was handled poorly for a number of 
reasons," he said. "There was a failure to communicate between me and their 
coaching staff. It was 100% my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Add Torrez: The Santa Paula starter is healthy enough to play, but will not be 
in the lineup for tonight's finale against Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Torrez was suspended from school for a week by Santa Paula administrators 
because he cursed at Huff and slammed his helmet into the ground after being 
removed from Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Torrez has a 3.2 grade-point average and an excellent attendance record, 
according to Santa Paula athletic director Henry Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
Add suspensions: Also, four Santa Paula players were suspended before the Santa 
Clara game because of disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
They are kicker Juan Carlos Rodriguez, fullback Jamie Jimenez, defensive tackle 
Richard Polcori and tight end Gabriel Alcantar. None will play this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ups and downs: For lessons in the importance of maintaining quality football 
teams at the freshman and sophomore levels, look no further than Hueneme and 
Fillmore highs. Not only do players become acquainted with the philosophies of 
their varsity coaches, but they also develop an attitude toward winning and 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
Hueneme (0-9 overall, 0-6 in the Channel League), for example, may suffer their 
first winless season under Coach George Machado. That team is composed of 
seniors who also failed to win a game at the freshman and sophomore levels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the old story about the circus elephant," Machado said. "You teach a 
baby elephant not to run away by tying a heavy chain from his leg to a stake. 
What happens after a short time is the elephant stops pulling on the chain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you see an older elephant tied to a stake with a thin rope. It 
doesn't want to make the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had as much talent as Dos Pueblos and San Marcos. But they 
traditionally win and play well as a team. We didn't have the intestinal 
fortitude to pull the rope. We were afraid to take the extra step to become a 
good team." 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore (9-0, 4-0) has become the upstart of the Tri-Valley League and the 
Flashes believe they has can knock perennial league champion Carpinteria from 
its perch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The juniors on Fillmore have never lost a Tri-Valley League game at any level. 
</P>
<P>
"To the kids, Carpinteria is no big mystical entity that we have to worry 
about," Fillmore Coach Curtis Garner said. "They have beaten them as freshman 
and sophomores and they see no reason why they can't beat them as juniors. I 
think their confidence has rubbed off on the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Add Fillmore: Quarterback/safety Chad Van Winkle, who missed two games with 
torn ligaments in his right (throwing) thumb, will start on defense and be used 
in a reserve role on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Art Sosa, who started the season at wide receiver, has been the quarterback the 
past two weeks. Garner is reluctant to make any changes. Sosa, more of a 
running threat than a passer, has 11 completions in 33 attempts for 141 yards 
and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're getting the job done with Sosa as quarterback," Garner said. 
"Van Winkle did a great job for us earlier this season, but I hate to make a 
change when we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
In six starts, Van Winkle has completed 37 of 70 passes for 531 yards and four 
touchdowns.

VENTURA, MATHEWS BUILD ON WINNING TRADITION

Basketball at Ventura College hasn't been the same since Phil Mathews stepped 
into the gymnasium in 1985 and led the Pirates to their first Western State 
Conference title in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the ball still bounces the same. It's just that it finds the basket more 
often when Mathews is storming the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has won four Northern Division championships, two Western State 
Conference titles and the 1986-87 state championship in Mathews' four years. 
The team has averaged 25 wins a season and won 82% of its conference games. 
Division I players such as Cedric Ceballos (Cal State Fullerton) and Pookey 
Wigington (Seton Hall) have worn Pirate uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore high expectations float around Telegraph Road this time of year. The 
Pirates open their season Friday night when they play host to San Bernardino at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only my expectations, but those of the institution and community," 
said Mathews, who can earn his 100th Ventura win Friday. "We all have a lot of 
expectations and want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura likely won't disappoint if it can overcome the inexperience of nine 
freshmen on a 14-player roster. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be young, but I think we'll be pretty good," said Mathews, 37, who has a 
99-30 overall record. "We're deep, quick, and we can do some things." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't what the rest of the conference wants to hear. Ventura was 28-6 last 
year and won the Northern Division title. Two starters return, and that duo of 
6-foot-7 forward Leo Parker and 6-5 forward Reggie Betton averaged 17.2 and 
16.8 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Lam, a 5-10 sophomore, has the edge for the starting spot at point 
guard. Ventura High's Chris Hantgin, a 6-4 sophomore who played at Gonzaga 
University in Spokane, Wash., last season, will start at off-guard. Lester 
Neal, a 6-6, 220-pound freshman from Chicago, Ill., will start at center. 
</P>
<P>
Should those five stumble, Mathews can find players such as Jerry Dalton and 
former Channel Islands High star Kevin Venable on his bench. Venable, a 6-5 
sophomore forward, was averaging 22 points and 13 rebounds when he blew out a 
knee early in the 1986-87 season, losing more than two years to rehabilitation. 
Dalton, a 6-1 freshman, is fighting with Lam for the point-guard position. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the conference's coaches are pointing at Ventura, but the Pirates 
aren't the only talented team. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is very, very strong," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. "(West L. 
A. Coach Charles Sands) was telling me he has one of the best teams he's ever 
had, but will probably finish in the middle or bottom of the league." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Coach Remy McCarthy said Ventura and Glendale are the teams to beat. 
"Then you can just throw all of us in there and it will be close." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is coming off a 20-12 season and is expected to be a contender, but the 
Condors have lost Andy Beltowski and Gary Hunter to season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Beltowski, a 6-5 forward who averaged nine points and eight rebounds as a 
starter last year, injured his back and left McCarthy with a large void in the 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a devastating blow," McCarthy said. "There is no way to measure his 
value to this team." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a 6-3 redshirt freshman who averaged 28 points a game and was Freeway 
League Player of the Year at Buena Park High, joined Beltowski in the trainer's 
room when he ruptured an Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
That puts even more burden on Randy Carter -- the lone returning starter -- 
when Oxnard opens against Allan Hancock at 7:30 Saturday night. Carter, a 6-4 
forward, averaged 17 points and nine rebounds last year and was all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Daughrity (6-1) and Santa Clara High's Art Santana (6-1) may start at the 
guard positions. Hueneme High's Jesse May (6-1), Channel Islands High's Omar 
Otis (6-5), and Gerry Coleman (6-5) are battling for starting positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about adjusting, and we need some big-league adjusting," McCarthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, meanwhile, is secure with four returning starters from last year's 
16-15 team. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders begin their season Nov. 10 with a first-round game at the Mt. San 
Antonio College Tipoff Tournament against Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's leading returning rebounder, 6-6 forward Greg Taylor, and three 
double-figure scorers return. Bruce Watson, a 6-6 forward from Thousand Oaks, 
averaged 11.6 points a game; Roger Thomas, an all-conference guard, led the 
team with an 11.7 average; and Sean Young averaged 10. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Crawford, a 5-10 freshman, will start at point guard and Jerry Markray, a 
6-8 sophomore, returns to Moorpark after a one-year stint at San Diego State.

STAKES RAISED IN COLLEGE RIVALRY; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK: REDEMPTION FROM LAST SEASON'S LOSS TO VENTURA ADDS TO RAIDERS' 
MOTIVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

How would Moorpark College love to win its game at Ventura? Let the Raiders 
count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, for the first time in years, the teams are playing for something 
more than Ventura County bragging rights. The game will likely decide the 
Western State Conference Northern Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (7-1, 6-1 in conference play, 3-0 in division play) and Ventura (7-1, 
6-1, 2-1) are ranked eighth and 11th in the state, respectively. If Moorpark 
wins, it's guaranteed at least a share of the Northern Division championship 
and a shot at the WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I can remember that both teams have had good teams," 
said Coach Jim Bittner, who is in his 17th year at Moorpark. "Normally, 
(Ventura's) only claim to fame was beating us. We were both sort of mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Northern Division is guaranteed a berth in the WSC Bowl, but 
a 9-1 record would make Moorpark a near shoo-in for the PONY Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't (win the last two games), we're just a team that had a pretty good 
season," Bittner said. "If we win this game, I think we'll be assured a bowl 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Another bowl, well actually a cup, is at stake. The Citrus Cup is awarded to 
the winner, and Moorpark will try to capture the cup for the third time in four 
years. Ventura, however, defeated Moorpark, 12-10, last year. "We've got to get 
that back," said Moorpark defensive back Troy Thomas, who has shown a 
propensity for getting things back with three interceptions in his last two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Cup could be considered the trophy for a mythical "Ventura County 
Bowl." For the only two football-playing Ventura County community colleges, the 
game is somewhat of a sibling rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Bittner characterizes the rivalry as friendly, but the Moorpark defense, ranked 
second in the state, will likely be whipped beyond its characteristic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark offense, also ranked second in the state, runs on the turbocharged 
legs of Freddie Bradley, a Ventura refugee. "I know just about everyone on the 
team," Bradley said of Ventura. "I'll be playing against a lot of my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Bradley, the leading scorer and eighth-leading rusher in the 
state, grow up in Ventura's back yard, but he also worked out with the Ventura 
team all summer before deciding to attend Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
For Bradley and Ventura, familiarity has not bred contempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's kind of bad because everyone is going to want to hit me," Bradley 
said of playing against his buddies. "I live right around everyone. If I had to 
listen to it the rest of the year. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark sophomores have been hearing about the teams' last meeting for a 
year, and the Raiders want revenge. Last season, Ventura, then 4-4, ambushed 
Moorpark, 8-0 at the time, with a victory on a last-second field goal. The loss 
knocked Moorpark out of consideration for the Potato Bowl and killed the 
Raiders' aspirations for a state championship. 
</P>
<P>
"They put a big blemish on it," Thomas said of the 1988 season. "We want to get 
a little pay-back."

HOUSE VOTES TO LET STATES ENACT STRICT OIL SPILL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major victory for environmentalists, the House voted Wednesday to 
significantly strengthen federal oil spill legislation by preserving the right 
of states to enact their own, stricter standards for clean-up efforts and 
liability limits. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 279 to 143 after heated debate, the House adopted a package of 
amendments by Reps. George Miller (D-Martinez) and Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.) 
that leaves intact existing oil-spill standards adopted by California and 
several other states. 
</P>
<P>
By a razor-thin margin of 213 to 207, the House adopted a separate amendment by 
Miller that would lift all limits on the financial liability of tankers and oil 
companies responsible for oil spills in cases of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Although work on the measure has not been completed, Wednesday's votes settled 
a longstanding congressional controversy over the rights of states to set their 
own oil spill clean-up and liability requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments sponsored by Miller and Studds shored up what critics had argued 
was the weakest part of the bill by striking a provision to set uniform, and in 
most cases, lower federal standards for oil spill liabilities than those in 
effect in a number of states. 
</P>
<P>
The votes also bring the House bill into closer alignment with legislation 
already passed by the Senate. The House is expected to finish work on the bill 
today and send it to a conference committee, where House and Senate negotiators 
will try to iron out differences between the two versions of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Long considered more sympathetic to oil industry interests, lawmakers in the 
House were frequently at loggerheads with the Senate over the question of state 
oil spill standards. But the ecological damage caused by the Exxon Valdez oil 
spill last March and the Bush Administration's new emphasis on environmental 
issues appear to have weakened the oil industry's influence on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress had to decide whether this bill would be an environmental bill or 
a company bill and it decided it would be an environmental bill," Miller said 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The Exxon Valdez was a national environmental insult to the American people, 
and today's vote was the House's response to its constituents' outrage," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Senate version passed in August, the House bill would create a 
national fund, probably financed by a new tax on oil, to pay for oil spill 
damages. It would make cleanup a federal responsibility coordinated by the 
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of Miller's amendment on negligence standards, the House 
measure goes even further than the Senate bill, which provides for unlimited 
liability only in instances of "gross negligence." 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association, issued a 
strongly worded statement calling on President Bush to veto the bill if it goes 
to his desk in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dismayed and distressed that the House has taken this gigantic step 
backwards in environmental protection. If the House's plan is adopted into law, 
many responsible transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and 
replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers," the trade group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless altered by conference committee action, we must strongly urge that the 
President veto this legislation," the API said. 
</P>
<P>
While supporters of the bill said that the House provision on negligence 
standards may be scaled back to conform with the Senate version, they expressed 
enthusiasm bordering on surprise at the extent of their victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very significant and very exciting. These (votes) add real teeth 
to the bill and, for the first time, we have a real deterrent to pollution by 
the oil industry," said Bob Sulnick, executive director of the Santa 
Monica-based American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the day-long debate focused on the question of whether states should 
retain the right they now have to enact and enforce their own oil pollution 
laws, a controversy that has long blocked passage of legislation in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the state preemption provision contained in the House bill argued 
that creating a single federal standard to replace a patchwork of existing 
state laws would ensure a speedier and more effective response to another 
disaster like the Exxon Valdez spill.

PERSONAL CARE SPRAYS CURBED IN SMOG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a dramatic new turn in the war on smog, the state Air Resources Board 
imposed unprecedented restrictions Wednesday on antiperspirant and deodorant 
aerosol sprays that could result in a ban on products that fail to meet the 
standards within five years. 
</P>
<P>
The action marked the first time ever that personal care products have been 
regulated because of their impact on smog. In the mid-1970s, the federal 
government banned some chemicals in certain aerosol products, but that was 
because they contributed to the destruction of the paper-thin stratospheric 
ozone layer that protects Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
While the rule approved here Wednesday would eliminate only a small percentage 
of smog-forming chemical emissions, the 6-2 vote could foreshadow air pollution 
controls on a wide variety of other personal care and consumer products from 
hair sprays to barbecue lighter fluids. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more at stake today than just (deodorants)," ARB Executive Officer 
James Boyd told the board. ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless called the decision 
a "landmark action." 
</P>
<P>
"It really gets down to impacts that people themselves are going to notice and 
going to feel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol antiperspirants and deodorants -- which account for 25% of product 
sales -- spew up to five tons a day of smog-causing volatile organic chemicals 
into the atmosphere statewide -- an amount equivalent to the emissions from a 
typical oil refinery. About half of those emissions occur in the four-county 
South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the new regulation, which will take effect early next year, 
manufacturers of aerosol spray deodorants and antiperspirants have until 1992 
to reduce overall emissions from their products by 20%. By 1995, those 
emissions will have to be reduced by 80%. 
</P>
<P>
However, manufacturers that submit an acceptable compliance plan in 1994 may be 
given until 1999 to meet that goal. If they fail to submit a plan, they must 
meet the 1995 deadline or remove the product from California's lucrative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The rule also prohibits using substitutes that would contribute to the 
depletion of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
In all, consumer and personal care products account for 250 tons a day in 
emissions of volatile organic compounds in California -- about half of them in 
the four-county basin. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB vote marks a dramatic departure in the state's decades-long war on 
smog, which until now has concentrated on reducing emissions from motor 
vehicles and industrial sources. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB staff estimated the aerosol regulation will add 25 cents to 50 cents to 
the cost of a product. Industry spokesmen, however, placed the cost between 31 
cents and $2.36 per can. They said 46 million cans of aerosol deodorants and 
antiperspirants are sold each year in California. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers were uncertain of the impact of the regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Their (the ARB's) intention is to ban aerosols. This is step No. 1. The only 
reason they aren't putting an outright ban is because there would be a hundred 
lawsuits," said George C. Dietrich, president of Diversified CPC International, 
an Illinois manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Dietrich, who said his company is the largest producer of aerosol propellants 
in the world, contended he could be forced to close his Anaheim plant, which 
produces propellants for the California market. 
</P>
<P>
"Should that market shift to any degree, we very well could remove that plant 
and its employees. This is not to be taken as a threat. It is a business 
decision," Dietrich told the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting the Timetable 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Engel of the Chemical Speciality Manufacturers Assn., said he could not 
yet say if his industry could meet the timetable. "I hope so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a string of industry representatives had appeared before the ARB to 
challenge the need for the rule, arguing that it would cost millions of dollars 
for little or no improvement in air quality. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the emission reduction is so small that it doesn't warrant this 
kind of treatment," Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jennifer Jennings, legal affairs director for the Planning and Conservation 
League, urged the board to impose tough limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a product form that is environmentally damaging, which is 
not needed for health and safety . . ." she said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule finally adopted by the ARB was even tougher than the recommendation of 
the board's own staff. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, all of whom are appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, called for 
earlier compliance deadlines than the staff had recommended. "These products 
are totally replaceable. . . . This is a good place to take some sort of a 
stand to reduce (smog)," said board member Gene Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor recently named to the board, 
challenged suggestions that aerosols were needed so that consumers could have a 
choice in products. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a problem with a choice that pollutes more," Bilbray declared. "I have 
a major problem subsidizing that choice with an (adverse) environmental 
impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB regulation is aimed primarily at volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such 
as butane, propane and iso-butane, which all contribute to smog. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the aerosol emissions, about 75 tons a year, come from an array of 
personal care products. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 25% of Californians who buy their deodorants and 
antiperspirants in pressurized aerosol spray cans, another 41% buy sticks, 29% 
roll-ons, and 5% buy pumps or other forms. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers were expected to have little difficulty meeting the initial 20% 
reduction in smog-causing emissions by 1992. But achieving an 80% reduction 
from 1989 levels by 1995 poses a more complicated problem. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB staff conceded that work will be required to develop substitutes that 
neither contribute to smog, global warming or depletion of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulation is not aimed primarily at the formula of the product but the 
propellant that pushes it out of the pressurized can. Propellants account for 
about 80% of the smog-forming emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a product is used, these pollutants are released into the atmosphere 
where they contribute to the formation of smog, the state's largest health 
hazard in the lower atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Smog is formed when the VOCs react with oxides of nitrogen in the presence of 
sunlight. Health studies have found that ozone pollution, which makes up 95% of 
smog, is responsible for respiratory illness, reduced lung capacity as well as 
damage to trees, crops, and building materials.

PANEL AGREES TO ALTER EVOLUTION GUIDE ON TEXTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Insisting they were trying to avoid redundancy and not bowing to pressure from 
the religious right, members of a Board of Education committee agreed Wednesday 
to remove references to evolution as scientific fact from a guideline for 
science textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-1 decision by the Policy and Planning Committee was a clear signal that a 
majority of the nine-member board will formally approve the 190-page guideline 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to alter the evolution section of the guideline came from Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig. He said he offered it as a compromise to satisfy 
some conservative board members who found the tone of the section to be too 
"argumentative." 
</P>
<P>
Honig contended the guideline still makes it clear that evolution has been 
accepted by scientists. To include the reference to it as scientific fact, he 
argued, would be repetitious and might "muddy the waters." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the modifications had also been requested by conservative 
religious groups, both Honig and board members steadfastly maintained that 
their only purpose in altering the document was "to make it clearer." They said 
the guideline still leaves no room for the teaching of creationism, the 
biblical version of the origin of man espoused by the religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you read this document you see very clear language," said Honig. 
"Evolution will be taught. It will be taught strongly. It will be taught in 
classes and if books don't reflect that they won't get adopted." 
</P>
<P>
The only objections to the proposed changes were raised by Paras Mehta of 
Cerritos, the student member of the board who sat in on the meeting even though 
he is not a member of the committee. Saying he feared the change may "deprive 
the document of its strength," Mehta urged the panel to think carefully before 
it removed the references to evolution as scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
However, only one board member, Committee Chairman Joseph Carrabino, cast a 
dissenting vote and his concerns were not directed at the modifications. 
Carrabino said his colleagues should delay approval of the guideline to allow 
more time to correct any potential technical flaws in the document. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision ends months of controversy spawned by conservative 
religious groups wanting drastic changes in the guideline and scientific and 
anti-censorship groups pushing for its adoption as written. The guideline was 
authored by a committee of scientists and educators and formally recommended to 
the board by the California Curriculum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, a religious group lobbying for teachers to be allowed to present 
creationism, said the modifications were "a beginning" but they did not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Only removing the statement evolution is a scientific fact from the 
introduction does not change the many, many dogmatic statements throughout the 
document," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hudson, western director for the civil libertarian group, People for 
the American Way, said it is clear that board members were influenced by the 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The document is clearly a strong science statement even with regard to 
evolution," he said. "The shame is that it had to be tarnished by concessions 
to the religious right." 
</P>
<P>
A new guideline is adopted by the board every seven years for publishers to use 
in writing textbooks. Once the textbooks are completed, they are then submitted 
to the board for final approval. The board draws up a list of accepted 
textbooks which local school districts use to select their teaching materials.

POLISH TRANSITION LEAVES NO SAFETY NET FOR NEEDY

When baker Krzysztof Lubaszka offered bread to pensioners at a price below his 
cost, so many people crowded into his shop in northern Warsaw that the 
plate-glass front window was smashed. 
</P>
<P>
What was meant as a simple act of charity in troubled times turned into 
pandemonium as speculators and the well-off vied with the truly poor to get the 
bargain bread. After a few days, Lubaszka called the whole thing off, then 
looked around for some other way to help. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when foreign governments are preparing large aid packages to help 
Poland through the painful transition from communism, Lubaszka stands as a 
frustrated symbol of the difficulties Poles are encountering. 
</P>
<P>
"People through these last 40 years have got accustomed to the idea that the 
state is giving them everything," Helena Guralska, deputy minister of Social 
Security, said Wednesday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Guralska, a former economic adviser to Solidarity, the independent trade union 
movement that now dominates the government, said the Communist authorities made 
promises they could not keep and at the same time suppressed efforts at 
independent social organization. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the old system has collapsed, she said, "there must be a change in the 
whole mentality" of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rapid deterioration of the economy means that the number of 
people facing poverty is rising sharply. Soaring inflation has made it 
particularly difficult for retired people and invalids. 
</P>
<P>
Zofia Hetman, 68, said her $10 monthly pension barely pays her rent and 
electricity bill and buys a small loaf of bread a day. 
</P>
<P>
Jacek Kuron, the minister of labor and social security, conceded that "Poland 
has practically no sensible social welfare system." 
</P>
<P>
"Such a system can be introduced," he said, "but that will take one, two, even 
three years. People need to be helped right now." 
</P>
<P>
The government planned to issue food stamps to the poorest 4.5 million of 
Poland's 38 million people, but the state bank refused to issue the coupons 
because it would cost too much. Kuron is expected to come up with an 
alternative idea by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Kuron, an often-jailed former dissident, said the other day on his weekly 
television program that his underground experience could serve as a model for 
the country in this time of economic need. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's launch a nationwide campaign to locate the needy and help them," he 
said. "In 1976, we set up the Workers Defense Committee to help unfairly 
dismissed workers. . . . We helped between 10,000 and 20,000 people at a time 
when you could lose your job for providing this kind of assistance, be beaten 
up and imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we achieved something bigger: the self-organization of 
society and the beginning of its subjectivity. This was the beginning of the 
road to Solidarity, to democracy and independence. We must realize this because 
we are in a similar situation now." 
</P>
<P>
There are some bright spots in the picture. The Polish Red Cross has organized 
soup kitchens in about half the country's counties. The Roman Catholic Church 
and an occasional private benefactor run similar charities. There are now about 
a dozen such outlets in Warsaw offering one hot meal a day to the old and the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross worker Ewa Jablonska said the organization's five Warsaw soup 
kitchens serve about 1,500 people, and the number is increasing every day. She 
said there has also been an increase in the number of working people asking for 
financial help. Their paychecks cannot keep pace with inflation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuron established an "SOS" fund to help the Red Cross and other charitable 
organizations, and it raised the equivalent of about $10,000 in the first two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, is only a drop in the ocean of need," he said, "but the 
stream of generosity is also flowing in other places." 
</P>
<P>
But Kuron's deputy, Guralska, sees weakness even in the initiatives that have 
been taken. 
</P>
<P>
"People haven't had a tradition of this sort of thing," she said. "One person 
opens a soup kitchen, and all of a sudden everybody wants to open one. Nobody 
has other ideas about what could be done." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition government is trying to encourage local initiatives to help those 
most in need, but its record is spotty. The one notable exception -- in a 
country where organized giving has all but disappeared in the last two 
generations -- is the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
But the church, too, has problems, according to Father Stefan Gralak, director 
of the charity commission for the Warsaw diocese. Ironically, the problems are 
rooted in Western aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to about 1980, to the time of Western aid, people were pretty sensitive on 
this issue," Gralak told an interviewer. "Any appeal from the parish was 
answered quickly and efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
But then, the churches became the preferred distribution channel for outside 
help, and that, rather than organizing aid, became their prime concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The aid from outside the country sort of damaged the structure of the help," 
Gralak said. "It spoiled the connections between us, and people became used to 
receiving rather than giving." 
</P>
<P>
The church will have little to do with distributing any new Western aid, Gralak 
said, adding: "The priests do not want this help. They fear it will spoil the 
people again. Now we're returning to our old methods and with our own means." 
</P>
<P>
Lubaszka, the baker, said that he, too, will try again. With the help of an 
apartment cooperative, he is getting up a list of 200 families that need 
low-cost bread. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is tragic," he said, "and we have to help each other. This was 
our goal, and it will be, despite the unfortunate beginning. Let them at least 
have bread!"

ROAD SIGNS? BOLINAS VOTERS SAY 'READ OUR LIPS' INSTEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attention, bureaucrats. Bolinas has made itself heard: It wants to make itself 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
In an overwhelming rejection of tourists, Caltrans and, perhaps, common sense, 
the 418 voters of the blissfully obscure Marin County village about 20 miles 
north of San Francisco voted nearly 3 to 1 Tuesday against allowing road signs 
directing travelers into town. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot, a nonbinding advisory measure, is the most definitive gesture yet 
by Bolinas residents in their long struggle with state highway engineers who 
insist on posting signs showing the route into town from California 1. 
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1960s, the town's rebels-with-a-cause have tried to remain 
rebels-without-a-cutoff by engaging the state's Department of Transportation in 
an epic -- and comic -- guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
Their beef is that signs attract tourists who will attract developers who will 
attract city folks in search of weekend homes, ruining the town's laid-back 
life style. Business owners, who put the issue on the ballot, argue that the 
sign war draws far more attention to Bolinas than the signs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
About 36 signs have been assiduously erected -- and stolen -- over the last 20 
years. Caltrans now installs inexpensive handmade signs to discourage the 
trophy hunters who, it is whispered, have boldly recycled purloined placards 
into coffee tables and wall hangings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, signs vanish as quickly as they are put up. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans once tried painting BOLINAS on the blacktop. Tar swiftly blacked out 
the letters. 
</P>
<P>
Highway Patrol officers tried hiding in the brush to catch sign stealers. 
Cunning sign-nappers simply waited for the somewhat absurd stakeout to end. 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, however, such shenanigans were dismissed by state workers and 
even some town residents as the anomalous act of an outlaw minority, the 
pointless prank of a small band of over-aged James Deans. 
</P>
<P>
That thesis was all but buried by Tuesday's election, in which 304 of 418 
voters rejected Measure N, a plebiscite in favor of signs. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the election would have changed very much in any case, said Greg 
Shelley, bartender at Smiley's Schooner Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
"The vote count doesn't really matter," Shelley told the San Francisco 
Examiner. "The sign's going to be torn down anyway -- it's an unwritten thing." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans declined to discuss the matter.

ASSEMBLYMAN, WIFE CLEARED IN PROBE OF LUPUS ORGANIZATIONS

<P>
The state attorney general has found nothing improper in the handling of 
finances by two lupus research organizations, one of which is headed by 
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) and the other by his wife, Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoryios Apallas, a deputy attorney general who oversaw the investigation, said 
Wednesday there was no misuse of funds by either the National Lupus 
Erythematosus Foundation, a nonprofit organization headed by Bane, or the 
three-member state Lupus Appropriations Board, on which Marlene Bane serves as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But Apallas said the attorney general's office has asked Bane to dissolve the 
foundation because it "has been inactive for some time now" and to distribute 
the remaining funds, more than $200,000, to lupus research. Bane said Wednesday 
that he is dissolving the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Bane said he was pleased but not surprised by the conclusion of state officials 
who examined the records of the foundation, which was founded in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office is responsible for ensuring that funds raised by 
nonprofit groups are used for their stated purpose. Prosecutors were prompted 
to launch the investigation in June after receiving a letter from Dr. Daniel J. 
Wallace, a medical adviser to the American Lupus Society's Southern California 
chapters and the Lupus Foundations of America. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace maintained that Bane's foundation "provides no services for lupus 
patients, supports no ongoing research and has no speakers program." In 
addition, people listed as board members said they had not been contacted for a 
meeting or other foundation matters in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Apallas said that as of now, only Bane and his wife, Marlene, are serving on 
the foundation's Board of Directors. He said the attorney general's office has 
recommended that Bane fill a majority of the seats on the board before final 
decisions are made on disbanding and distributing the remaining funds. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace had also challenged the propriety of $801,473 in grants that the 
three-member state Lupus Appropriations Board made to Dr. Raymond L. Teplitz, a 
longtime friend of the Banes and a contributor to the lawmaker's campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Apallas said there was "no misuse of funds" in connection with the grants to 
Teplitz. He determined that Teplitz is an "able, conscientious researcher who 
did top-quality work" on lupus. Teplitz was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit on behalf of taxpayers, lupus support groups in June charged that 
more than $1 million in state funds appropriated for lupus research has been 
illegally diverted to non-lupus projects. The suit against Bane, his wife and 
other members of the Lupus Appropriations Board is pending in Superior Court in 
Van Nuys, according to Debra Wegman, a lawyer for the lupus groups. 
</P>
<P>
Wegman questioned whether Teplitz conducted lupus research, saying, "It's a 
little difficult for me to accept that there was no impropriety when $800,000 
in Lupus Appropriations Board money went to cancer research."

RESIDENTS REJECT PAROLE OF ROTHENBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Desert Center in Riverside County have angrily rejected the parole 
of Charles Rothenberg to a nearby prison facility, indicating the kind of 
reception that may loom this winter for the father imprisoned for setting his 
son afire 6 1/2 years ago in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
State prison officials searching for a spot to place Rothenberg when he is 
released early next year said they were not entirely surprised by the fierce 
opposition voiced at a heated meeting earlier this week in this town about 
halfway between Blythe and Indio. They said they will now look for another 
place to send Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Public opposition was so furious in several Northern California cities over the 
release in 1987 of Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl 
and hacking off her forearms with an ax, that he finally had to be housed in a 
trailer on the San Quentin Prison grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that won't be the case" with Rothenberg, state Department of 
Corrections spokesman Tip Kindel said Wednesday. "But given that experience, we 
certainly are preparing for that." 
</P>
<P>
Kindel said that wherever Rothenberg is placed, he will be under close 
supervision in a "structured program." He will not, however, be placed in 
Orange County, where his son and ex-wife live. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg's son, David, and former wife, Marie Hafdahl, have said they want no 
contact with the man who disfigured the boy, then 6 years old, in a 1983 motel 
kerosene fire. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to The Times, Rothenberg said he will always live with the 
pain of knowing that he nearly killed his only son and that he wants to help 
other parents who commit "child abuse." He has said previously that he will not 
try to contact either David or his ex-wife, who is now married to Buena Park 
Police Lt. Richard Hafdahl. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like him as far away as possible," Richard Hafdahl said Tuesday. "But 
we would actually prefer he be in California so we are in a better position to 
check on where he is at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials met Tuesday night with 182 residents in Desert Center to 
discuss possibly paroling Rothenberg to a state facility about 25 miles from 
their community. Known as the Eagle Mountain Return to Custody Center, the 
minimum-security compound houses about 200 men. It is in a former mining town 
abandoned years ago by Kaiser Steel Co. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County officials granted the center a conditional-use permit last 
year on the agreement that the facility not house inmates convicted of arson, 
sex crimes or other violence. Part of the agreement calls for residents to 
approve any exception to those rules. 
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot Tuesday night, the residents rejected Rothenberg's parole to 
the facility near their community by a vote of 150 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can tell, the margin was not exactly close," Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials must now "return to the drawing boards" in their search for a 
place to parole Rothenberg, a former New York waiter who claimed that he tried 
to kill his son to hurt the wife who divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg is tentatively scheduled to be released from the California Men's 
Colony at San Luis Obispo on Jan. 9.

ROAD TAX HIKES IN TWO CONGESTED AREAS REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WERE IN NO MOOD FOR NEW 
LEVIES, BOND ISSUES OR SALARY BOOSTS.

<P>
In an apparent paradox, voters in two heavily congested areas of Southern 
California -- Orange County and the Santa Clarita Valley -- rejected tax 
increases to finance road improvements in Tuesday's elections, while voters in 
outlying, less-congested areas were approving such increases. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, a half-cent sales tax boost for traffic improvements, 
including a six-lane widening of the often-jammed Santa Ana Freeway, lost, 
getting a 53% negative vote. In the Santa Clarita Valley, a measure to add $75 
to $200 to residential property tax bills for $285 million to build and widen 
roads went down to a 79.7% defeat. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, voters in relatively less-congested San Bernardino, Santa 
Barbara and Imperial counties all approved half-cent sales tax increases to 
build better roads. 
</P>
<P>
In other significant election results around the state: 
</P>
<P>
* Voters in San Francisco narrowly rejected, by 50.5% -- or less than 2,000 
votes -- a proposal to issue bonds to build a new downtown baseball stadium for 
the San Francisco Giants. The city's bitterly disappointed mayor, Art Agnos, 
promptly predicted that the Giants would leave town. 
</P>
<P>
* San Franciscans, however, approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax for 
traffic improvements by about a 2-1 margin, and 87% cast ballots for a 
$59.7-million earthquake safety bond issue that had been placed on the ballot 
before the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego voters gave environmentalists apparent control of the City Council, 
rejecting two pro-developer candidates. It was the first time in decades that 
council candidates ran in separate districts. 
</P>
<P>
* With scattered exceptions, voters in municipalities up and down the state 
rejected special-purpose property or utility tax increases ranging from 
providing more money for law enforcement to financing school and sanitation 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the many anti-tax votes, however, some observers said Wednesday they 
detected a slow trend in California toward less resistance to tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a spokesman for the County Supervisors Assn. of California, Dan 
Wall, pointed out that, adding the new county sales tax increase votes to past 
ones, 16 of California's 58 counties have now approved taxes in excess of the 
state's basic 6 1/4% sales tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the basic message that has been going out from county supervisors for 
the past five years now is that the revenue we're getting from the state is not 
sufficient to do the job," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Orange County, the vote this time against the proposed sales tax 
increase was less one-sided than on an earlier try for an increase, in 1984, 
when voters rejected a proposed 1-cent hike by a massive 70%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competence of Leaders 
</P>
<P>
In both Orange County and the Santa Clarita Valley, some activists said, a lack 
of confidence in the competence and integrity of elected officials might also 
have been major factors in rejection of the tax-increase proposals. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, by contrast, the Board of Supervisors worked with 
considerable political skill to reshape a previously rejected road improvement 
tax increase to ensure that a substantial amount of the money went to 
improvements in the High Desert areas that had voted massively against the 
proposal the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive campaign was waged in Orange County, with proponents of the 
tax increase spending an estimated $2.5 million compared to only about $10,000 
for the victorious opponents. That campaign brought the voter turnout to 22%, a 
record for an off-year election in the county, but it could not put the road 
improvement program over. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, across the state, regardless of any trend toward less decisive 
defeats of tax, salary and bond measures, most such proposals still were 
defeated. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
* In San Diego County, voters in Encinitas defeated a $25-million park bond 
issue, in Imperial Beach a 5% utility tax measure, in Vista a $38.8-million 
school improvement proposal and in Ramona a $2.2-million bond issue for the 
water district. 
</P>
<P>
* In Modesto, 63% of voters turned down a proposal to raise the salaries of the 
mayor and council members. 
</P>
<P>
* In Selma, 72% voted against increasing utility bills up to 5% for added 
police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
* In Arvin, 88% rejected a property tax increase of $100 for homes and $400 for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
* In Chowchilla, voters refused, by nearly a 2-1 margin, to form a hospital 
assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
* Sales tax increases for roads were rejected decisively in Nevada County and 
trailed by only seven votes among 42,000 cast in Monterey, with 500 absentee 
votes remaining to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
But there were exceptions. For example, in Tulare, voters narrowly approved a 
six-year extension of an earlier-voted property tax increase for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
One of the angriest reactions to an election outcome in the state came in San 
Francisco where municipal officials vowed to investigate $50,000 in what they 
termed suspicious contributions that came in in the final days for a mail 
campaign against the proposed Giants baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Agnos has charged that some of this money came from Gregg Lukenbill, 
owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball franchise. Lukenbill is the organizer 
of moves to acquire both the Los Angeles Raiders football franchise and, 
ultimately, a professional baseball franchise, for a new outdoor stadium to be 
built in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill denied Agnos' charge. Executives of one company that had helped build 
the Lukenbill-operated Arco Arena in Sacramento and contributed $12,500 to the 
mail campaign against the San Francisco stadium did not return calls asking for 
comment. Another $12,500 contributor denied any relationship to Lukenbill. 
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said he would investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
While Agnos despaired of keeping the Giants in San Francisco, saying, "I don't 
know if we can be competitive anymore," the owner of the baseball team, Bob 
Lurie, said the team will play in Candlestick Park, its present home, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But Lurie refused to commit himself beyond that, saying, "What happens after 
next season is simply not known." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Interested Parties 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sunnyvale Mayor Larry Stone said a consortium of officials in the 
so-called Silicon Valley stands ready to dust off an offer to construct a 
Giants stadium in Santa Clara County. Tampa, Denver and Vancouver, B.C., are 
among cities that have also expressed interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Most cities will want to wait, as they say, for the body to get cold," said 
Corey Busch, Giants vice president and aide to Lurie, adding that he expects 
several cities to contact the Giants in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions by officials Wednesday that more than 10,000 absentee 
votes had been cast in the days immediately after the Oct. 17 earthquake, when 
sentiment was strong that San Francisco would have to devote all its resources 
to earthquake repairs, and that these may have tipped the narrow vote against 
the stadium. With a relatively few absentee votes still to be counted, the 
tally was 86,732 against the stadium and 84,755 for it.

WAR SHADOWS CAMPAIGNING IN NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: VOTER REGISTRATION IN RURAL AREAS HAS SURGED ALONG WITH REBEL 
ACTIVITY. BUT BOTH SIDES FEAR ATTACK.

<P>
Since the start of Nicaragua's election campaign 10 weeks ago, the Contras have 
augmented their forces around this frontier town, telling peasant farmers to 
vote against the Sandinista government and stepping up armed attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The quickening rebel activity has contributed to an overwhelming turnout for 
voter registration here, especially in rural hamlets where anti-Sandinista 
sentiment runs high. But civilian opposition leaders complain that it has 
exposed them to charges by the government that they support violence and 
brought down restrictions on peaceful politicking. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events around Rio Blanco offer a case study, in one rural area, of how 
war is shadowing politics as Nicaragua struggles toward an election that is 
aimed at stopping the bloodshed. It is a place where, after eight years of 
fighting, much of the stumping is conducted by armed brigades. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the election is not so clear," said Father Domingo Pepe, a 
Roman Catholic priest in Rio Blanco. "What dominates most here is fear." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 21, 18 Sandinista soldiers being trucked to register to vote died in an 
ambush that, by all accounts, was set by the Contras. Six other soldiers and 
civilians have been killed near the town in rebel attacks since formal 
campaigning opened Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the ambush and growing rebel infiltration from Honduras, President 
Daniel Ortega ended a 19-month cease-fire throughout Nicaragua on Nov. 1. As 
the Sandinista army readied troops, helicopters and artillery for a major 
offensive, the Interior Ministry reported killing 14 rebels in an ambush last 
Thursday near here. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas have also mounted a political offensive here to link the 
14-party National Opposition Union (UNO) to the Contra ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Rock-throwing Sandinista gangs, called turbas, have attacked opposition rallies 
in the war-zone towns of Jalapa, Matagalpa and Pantasma in the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Rio Blanco, an angry crowd of ruling party supporters, some of them 
armed, gathered outside the homes of local opposition leaders two days after 
the Contra ambush, demanding that they clarify their ties to the U.S.-backed 
insurgency or condemn it. 
</P>
<P>
In official statements, UNO has tried to cast doubt on the government's version 
of the ambush. It has issued statements here and in Managua denying any 
coordination with the rebels and rejecting all acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, however, local activists admit they know that the Contras staged 
the attack but are afraid to say so publicly. They concede that rebel violence 
has bloodied the group's image and prompted defections by some of their 
campaign workers, but they feel powerless to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is very threatening," said Crisanto Sosa, who was a lieutenant 
in former dictator Anastasio Somoza's National Guard and is now president of 
UNO's local branch. "If we denounce the Contras, at a certain point they could 
grab us and kill us. We cannot compromise ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Sosa spoke to reporters Saturday in a hotel he owns while hundreds of 
Sandinista supporters gathered a block away in the town square for a speech by 
Ortega, who is seeking reelection. The politician said the group had been 
ordered by security officials to halt local campaigning the week of Ortega's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
As the idled opposition leader returned to his card game in the hotel 
courtyard, the crowd in the plaza chanted: "UNO, the Contras and Somoza -- 
they're all la misma cosa (the same thing)!" 
</P>
<P>
Rio Blanco, a major trading post at the edge of the central highlands, is as 
polarized as any Nicaraguan town. While the revolution has brought land, 
schooling and better medical care to many of its people, hundreds of others 
have taken up arms to protest food rationing, collective farming, obligatory 
military service and police repression. 
</P>
<P>
Last July 19, when the Sandinistas marked 10 years in power, Rio Blanco marked 
an entire year without a Contra ambush. But even during the truce, small 
conflicts simmered and Sandinista agents moved ruthlessly against the rebels' 
network of civilian supports. 
</P>
<P>
The election campaign has brought these tensions back to the surface. Chants of 
"Viva el FDN!" -- a salute to the Contra army -- erupted at a rally here in 
August. A wall slogan in town condemns Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the UNO 
presidential candidate: "Violeta Dies, the Revolution Stays." 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials estimate that 200 Contras have filtered back from Honduras 
since August to double the rebel presence in the hills around Rio Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming in with two to three new uniforms (apiece), as if to show their 
support from the United States is as strong as ever," said Pedro Haslam, the 
top Sandinista official here. "Their message is: 'Vote for the UNO or the war 
will continue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Election officials said 16,637 people signed up during the voter registration 
period in October -- more than four times the number who did so in 1984, when 
the Sandinistas faced weak opposition. So heavy was the crush in some rural 
precincts this time that two small children standing in line with their mothers 
died of suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
"There was too much enthusiasm," said a Sandinista supporter. "They stood in 
line all night. They want to change the government." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders charged that 25% of the eligible voters who tried to 
register were turned away -- in some cases by the army, in others by election 
officials who had run out of registration cards. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Sandinista officials said the rebels intimidated peasants by 
claiming to have a "special machine" to determine how each person votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Holding an election here in Rio Blanco, with civic guarantees and all, is 
going to be very difficult," Haslam said. "This is a territory of conflict and 
the clearest conflict here is between the Sandinista army and the Contras. . . 
. To the Contras, it's not a question of which side has the best program. It's 
a question of military might. . . . The UNO is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials said Ortega's decision to end the cease-fire was aimed in 
part at neutralizing the Contras' role in the election and blaming UNO for the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting with UNO leaders, Haslam demanded that they explain an 
encounter they had in September with a rebel chieftain and a communique signed 
by Enrique Bermudez, the senior rebel commander, instructing his troops to 
serve as "guarantors" of an opposition election victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a coincidence of political ideology with the Contras, but we do not 
have joint plans," said Vicente Juarez, a local leader. He said that if he had 
any influence, "I would say to the Contras: 'Act only in self-defense and don't 
attack.' If the war increases, it will only favor the Sandinistas." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, farmers and townspeople say they are concerned less about which 
side is reviving the war than how they are going to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living through tremendous anxiety. Everybody is frightened and 
afflicted, waiting for a great war," said Yelva Guzman, 54, who sells hot meals 
and medicine from her farmhouse outside town. "We are afraid of both sides 
because both have arms. People die on one side and the other because the arms 
are all the same, the soldiers are all the same."

ORTEGA EXPANDS PEACE OFFER TO CONTRAS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: THE SANDINISTA LEADER SEES 'A GREAT OPPORTUNITY' FOR ACCORD IN TALKS 
STARTING IN NEW YORK TODAY.

<P>
President Daniel Ortega said Wednesday that the Sandinista army will suspend 
acquisitions of new weapons until next April 25 if the U.S.-backed Contras 
accept a timetable for closing their bases in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega outlined his proposal after dispatching six Sandinista negotiators to 
New York for talks with Contra leaders at U.N. headquarters starting today. He 
instructed his team to insist on a settlement in a single round of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, the first between the two sides since September, 1988, were proposed 
by Ortega when he ended a 19-month cease-fire Nov 1. The two moves are aimed at 
bringing military and diplomatic pressure on the rebels to accept their 
disbanding under an agreement signed Aug. 7 at Tela, Honduras, by the five 
Central American presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great opportunity for an agreement," Ortega told reporters 
Wednesday. "If no agreement is reached, then the Contras are clearly voting for 
more war." 
</P>
<P>
His proposal sets forth a series of steps to comply with the Tela accord, 
including the disarming of all Contra soldiers in Honduras by Dec. 5 and their 
repatriation to Nicaragua -- with amnesty and resettlement aid -- or to other 
countries as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras are asked to renounce any U.S. aid after Nov. 30 that is not 
channeled through a commission set up to supervise the Tela accord. It is led 
by Javier Perez de Cuellar and Joao Baena Soares, secretaries general of the 
United Nations and the Organization of American States, respectively, who will 
mediate the talks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ortega proposal contains two new elements to address recent 
Contra demands. It would give Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman 
Catholic Nicaraguan prelate who is an outspoken critic of Ortega, a role in 
monitoring the agreement. And it would release all prisoners held by the 
Sandinistas for counterrevolutionary activity as soon as half of the estimated 
7,000 rebels now in Honduras are disarmed and all people held against their 
will in the Contra camps are freed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials say there are 846 such prisoners in their jails and 1,845 
captives in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
But the surprise element was the proposed suspension of arms acquisitions. 
Sandinista officials said it was aimed mostly at the Bush Administration, which 
has been seeking to halt the flow of Soviet Bloc weapons to Nicaragua and to 
scale down the 70,000-strong Sandinista army. 
</P>
<P>
"The Contras aren't going to do anything unless the United States tells them 
to," said Alejandro Bendana, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry official. "This is 
an attractive offer for the United States . . . the last chance for an honest, 
decent, face-saving way out." 
</P>
<P>
At Washington's behest, the Soviet Union has suspended arms shipments to 
Nicaragua until after the Feb. 25 election. And Ortega has promised the Soviets 
that weapons obtained from other sources will be publicly catalogued. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders said this week that Nicaragua unloaded a boatload of weapons from 
Cuba last Friday. Ortega said Wednesday that if this were true, it would be 
confirmed in due time. He did not deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras' five-member negotiating team will be led by Enrique Bermudez, the 
senior rebel commander, and joined by a four-member civil-military commission. 
The Sandinista delegation is headed by Victor Hugo Tinoco, a deputy foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Aristides Sanchez said in Miami that his side will take a proposal 
to the U.N. talks and disclose it today. He said the Sandinista offer is "worth 
careful study" but indicated the rebels want political concessions as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the rebels will also insist that their forces inside Nicaragua -- 
about 3,000 soldiers now -- be allowed to gather in cease-fire enclaves while 
awaiting concessions that will induce them to disarm. The Sandinista proposal 
offers cease-fire corridors so that rebels can retreat peacefully to Honduras 
and disarm there. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega insisted that the Honduran government, which has played host to the 
rebels throughout the eight-year war, take part in the negotiations. But 
Honduras agreed only to attend as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cease-fire ended, the army has reported few details of its new 
operations and only seven rebel casualties. It deployed trucks and helicopters, 
along with heavy artillery, toward war zones north and east of Managua. But 
there is no evidence of the multi-battalion sweeps that were common at the 
height of the war. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in a situation of expectation," said a European military 
specialist. "There's no cease-fire, but there's no grand offensive either. What 
we have is a reinforcement and an intensification of the small-scale, 
search-and-destroy patrols that never stopped during the cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista strategists are clearly hoping that the rebels, whose U.S. military 
aid was cut off early last year, will come to the table eager to sign. But 
Sanchez said it is the Sandinistas who are more eager to settle because of the 
negative international reaction to their decision to resume the war. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in no hurry to sign a bad agreement, and that's what the Sandinistas 
are offering," Sanchez said.

RULING ON FBI SEIZURES DEFENDED IN CONGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AIDE WARNS OF 'TERRORISM AND NARCO-TERRORISM.' REP. 
EDWARDS CALLS THIS A 'RADICAL PROPOSAL.'

<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief legal adviser Wednesday cited mounting 
terrorist and drug threats as justification for his June 21 opinion that the 
FBI has legal authority to seize fugitives overseas without a foreign country's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights, Assistant Atty. Gen. William P. Barr dismissed as "fundamentally 
flawed" a 1980 Carter Administration ruling that denied the FBI such authority. 
</P>
<P>
Barr was pressed by California Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the subcommittee 
chairman, on why "this very radical proposal" was issued at a time of 
increasing detente. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing an increasing menace in the area of terrorism and 
narco-terrorism," said Barr, who as head of the Justice Department's office of 
legal counsel is known as "the attorney general's lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
"There are still lawless countries in the world that sponsor terrorism directed 
at the United States," Barr added. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said that his subcommittee keeps "very careful count" of terrorist 
incidents, and noted that they had dropped from more than 100 annually to an 
"infinitesimal" level this year and last. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the crisis?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Chairman, I'm sure the families of the people on Pan Am 103 will be glad 
to know that the incidents in the United States were infinitesimal," Barr shot 
back, referring to the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the London-to-New York flight 
that crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. Among the 270 killed were 189 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Barr emphasized at the hearing that his analysis did not mark a change in 
policy but only a legal opinion that under U.S. law, the FBI now has authority 
to conduct arrests abroad without a foreign country's consent. That opinion was 
also emphasized by Abraham D. Sofaer, State Department legal adviser, and 
Oliver B. Revell, FBI associate deputy director for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The three Administration witnesses said that there is an "inter-agency process" 
that would be followed to ensure that the President considers foreign policy 
and international law before dispatching agents to seize suspects abroad 
without the foreign country's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Sofaer and Revell said that foreign countries had expressed concern after 
Barr's opinion was disclosed on Oct. 13 by The Times. Foreign officials 
expressed "concern that we were going to mount up like the Lone Ranger," Revell 
said, but "we have given assurances there is no change in our practice and 
policy of conferring with them" before moving against fugitives in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said that the FBI had sought the reexamination of the Carter era ruling 
because its criminal investigative division wanted "to look at a number of 
different scenarios." Other intelligence sources, however, have said that the 
FBI submitted the issue to Barr's offices when it was seeking to seize a 
fugitive from the Middle East, months before the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances of the Administration witnesses that the authority was 
limited and would be examined carefully before being used, Rep. Edwards 
remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of no law passed by the Congress or any provision of the 
Constitution that licenses the United States to be an international outlaw," 
Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's opinion was hailed in an opening statement by one member of the 
subcommittee, Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), who left the hearing before 
testimony began. 
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner said he was concerned that the inquiry "appears to be an effort 
to hamstring" the FBI. If the Carter era ruling were still in effect, the only 
persons who would benefit are "the Kadafis, Noriegas" and drug cartel leaders, 
he said, referring to Libya's strongman Col. Moammar Kadafi and Panama's Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega.

WHERE IN WORLD ARE WE? SOME U.S., SOVIET CITIZENS NOT SURE

<P>
Despite years of studying the subject, the average Soviet citizen knows even 
less geography than the average American, according to a National Geographic 
Society survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both superpowers, in fact, are outclassed in geographical knowledge by 
countries like Sweden and West Germany. A sizable number of Soviets and 
Americans cannot even spot their own countries on a map. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks before the December summit meeting between President Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on warships in the Mediterranean, 
National Geographic Society President Gilbert M. Grosvenor said the survey 
proves that "their constituents have an astounding ignorance of the world 
around them." 
</P>
<P>
There was one hopeful sign for the Soviet Union: Soviets between the ages of 18 
and 24 did far better than young American adults, who ranked lowest among the 
10 countries surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
But the scores were a disappointment to the Soviet Union, where, according to 
Dr. Vladimir G. Andreyenkov, chief of methodology at the institute of sociology 
in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the average pupil takes courses in geography 
for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the results of this education are not so exciting," said 
Andreyenkov. "In principle, I am not satisfied with these results. We thought 
that our results should be better." 
</P>
<P>
In a special test administered for the society by the Gallup Organization, 
11,500 adults in 10 countries were asked to identify 16 countries and other 
geographic sites, such as the Persian Gulf, on a map. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans did best, correctly identifying an average of 11.6 of the 16 
sites, followed by Swedes, who identified 11.2; Japanese, 9.7; French, 9.3; 
Canadians, 9.2; Americans, 8.6; British, 8.5; Italians, 7.6; and, in a tie for 
last place, Mexicans and Russians averaging 7.4 correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of all these countries except the Soviet Union was conducted in the 
spring of 1988. In April and May of this year, the survey was expanded to cover 
the Soviet Union, with researchers from Andreyenkov's institute of sociology 
polling 1,500 residents of Moscow and the industrial city of Kursk. 
</P>
<P>
When the first results were announced in July, 1988, there was a good deal of 
dismay over the dismal achievement of the Americans. And even now, with the 
poor Soviet scores added to the survey, Americans could take little solace from 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
The results showed that 14% of American adults could not even identify the 
United States on a map, 54% could not find Japan, 68% could not find Vietnam 
and 71% could not find West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Americans aged 14 to 18 could identify an average of only 6.9 of the 16 sites 
on the test -- the lowest score for any country. In fact, the United States was 
the only country where young adults did worse on the test than adults over the 
age of 55 -- a sure sign that geographic knowledge is dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going downhill and the others are going uphill," said Grosvenor. "I 
would like to see geography returned to the curriculum in this country. . . . 
Geography dropped out of the school system after World War II. When it was 
taught, it was sometimes taught by the football coach." 
</P>
<P>
Grosvenor also noted with disappointment that Americans simply do not look on 
geography as important. In a questionnaire that accompanied the map test, 52% 
of the Soviets replied that knowledge of geography is "absolutely necessary" to 
be considered a well-rounded individual. Only 37% of Americans replied that 
geography is "necessary." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, the Soviet results were surprisingly poor: 13% could not find their 
own nation on a map and -- despite the searing cataclysm of World War II -- 61% 
could not find West Germany. The Soviets did much better than the Americans at 
finding neighbors like Japan and Sweden. But, in a special question for the 
Soviet survey alone, 62% failed to spot neighboring Afghanistan despite their 
country's 10 years of military involvement there. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet scores were brought down by extremely poor results among adults over 
the age of 55. At the same time, the scores of adults aged 18 to 24 ranked 
close to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Andreyenkov attributed the poor showing by older Soviet citizens to the general 
breakdown of the educational system before and during World War II.

BISHOPS BACK SMALLER FARMS, ADOPTION OF BLACK RITES

In separate actions unanimously adopted Wednesday, the nation's Roman Catholic 
bishops declared that U.S. agricultural land should be owned by as many small 
farmers as possible and that black worship styles should be incorporated into 
more Catholic parishes. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, who will 
conclude their four-day fall meeting here today, also overwhelmingly approved a 
controversial plan to allow lay men and women to conduct Sunday religious 
services in remote areas when priests are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
In their statement on farms, the bishops said the growing concentration of 
agricultural land in the hands of a few corporations had produced "a farm 
crisis" and threatened the livelihoods of thousands of U.S. farmers who have 
lost their land in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to return the means of production to the greatest number of people 
possible," Bishop Thomas J. Connolly of Baker, Ore., said during discussion of 
the 32-page policy paper. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the U.S. Congress' plan to draft a comprehensive statement on 
agricultural policy next year, the bishops said such a plan should include 
"food security as the ultimate goal . . . ensuring that every human being has 
access to enough food to maintain a decent human standard of living." 
</P>
<P>
The bishops' farm statement also asks the federal government to restructure tax 
and commodity programs to favor small-farm owners, and it urged less dependence 
on commercial fertilizers and pesticides that pose risks to farm workers and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops' plan to evangelize and guide the nation's 2 million black 
Catholics affirms the "rich, cultural dimension" of African-American identity, 
heritage and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the document, "Here I Am, Send Me," notes that black church 
leaders must daily confront "issues of injustice, institutional racism, 
economic oppression, and human exploitation and waste." 
</P>
<P>
Although he pointed out that the action paper had been in preparation for two 
years, Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore said "it would be foolish to 
deny that Father (George) Stallings was a catalyst" for the bishops' 
enthusiastic response to the plan Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Stallings, a maverick black priest, formed an independent temple 
in Washington, D.C., drawing several thousand black Catholics to his 
unauthorized weekly services. He has charged that the church hierarchy is 
unresponsive to the needs of black Catholics and has accused the church of 
"institutional racism." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings was not present at the bishops' meeting here nor was he or his church 
a part of conference business. 
</P>
<P>
The measure that will allow nuns and lay church members to conduct Sunday 
worship services in the absence of a priest or deacon drew sharp debate. Some 
bishops said they were fearful that it would be misinterpreted as giving the 
laity permission to celebrate Mass without a priest's being present. 
</P>
<P>
The rites will allow lay persons to lead prayers, preach and distribute 
Communion wafers only if a priest has consecrated them beforehand. Consecration 
of the host is a sacramental act reserved for priests to perform and it is the 
essence of the Catholic Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Although "priestless" Sunday services already occur in 51 dioceses with severe 
clergy shortages -- mostly in Alaska, Wyoming, Texas and Utah -- the new rites 
would standardize the procedures and prayers for the celebrations, according to 
Bishop Joseph P. Delaney of Ft. Worth, chairman of the Committee on Liturgy. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep insisting, however, that the celebration of the Eucharist (Mass) in 
every parish every Sunday is our desire," Delaney said at a news conference 
before the 225-18 vote favoring the plan was announced. 
</P>
<P>
But retired Bishop William McManus of Ft. Wayne, Ind., was still unhappy. The 
new rite, he said, "will bless a monster that could destroy the Sunday Mass 
tradition and Sunday Mass obligation" of U.S. Catholics.

CONGRESS ENACTS $4.25 MINIMUM WAGE; BUSH PRAISED FOR BACKING COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Congress completed action Wednesday on a compromise bill to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour and sent it to the White House for President 
Bush's promised signature. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, in a swift follow-up to overwhelming approval in the House last 
week, beat back proposed amendments that would have aided small business and 
agricultural interests and passed the measure, 89 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for the federal minimum wage to rise from the current $3.35 
an hour to $3.80 next April 1, then to $4.25 a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush vetoed a bill last June that would have raised the basic pay rate 
to $4.55 an hour over three years, he was praised by Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and others for his support of the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"The working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not as much 
as they deserve," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate 
Labor and Human Resources Committee and chief sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he would do his best to see that another increase, effective in 
the presidential election year of 1992, is passed. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said that about 11 million workers would benefit from the increase. In 
a concession to Bush, the bill would also establish for the first time a lower 
"training rate" for teen-agers during their first 60 days of working. Employers 
could pay the lower wage for 60 days longer if their training programs are 
approved by the Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
California, which already has a $4.25-an-hour minimum wage, would not be 
affected by the federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The President at first proposed raising the base wage to $4.25 an hour over 
three years, with a lower rate for six months for all newly hired workers, 
regardless of age or previous experience. At one point, he said that he would 
veto any bill that differed from his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
President Ronald Reagan successfully opposed any increase in the minimum wage 
during his eight years in the White House, on grounds that it would be 
inflationary and would price younger, unskilled workers out of the job market. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) made the same arguments Wednesday, but Bush's 
endorsement of the bill ensured its passage through the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the raise said that the average hourly pay for all rank-and-file 
workers has climbed to $9.70 an hour and that starting pay for even menial jobs 
is now $5 or $6 an hour in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who has been a frequent critic of Bush in recent weeks, paid tribute 
to him during the closing debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the President, who was willing to stand up and 
come out for a minimum wage increase, contrary to the previous Administration," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took a more critical view, saying that the Bush-backed compromise "owes 
more to the ideological embarrassment of those seeking tax relief for capital 
gains than it does to any real commitment to the minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole praised the outcome in a statement, 
saying: "With the Senate passage of the minimum wage bill, the President's 
commitment to a reasonable wage hike coupled with a meaningful training wage is 
finally fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
At the $4.25 hourly rate, a person working full time would earn $170 a week, or 
$8,840 a year. That is below the federal poverty-level income of $12,100 a year 
for a family of four.

SON OF ACTORS IRELAND AND MCCALLUM FOUND DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason David McCallum -- the son of actor David McCallum and actress Jill 
Ireland -- whose troubled life and battles against drugs and alcohol were a 
focus of Ireland's recently published book "Life Lines," was found dead in his 
Laurel Canyon home, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the 27-year-old McCallum was found by his girlfriend, Tracy Medina, 
on the bathroom floor of his rented apartment early Tuesday evening, Los 
Angeles police spokeswoman Margie Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of death was unknown, she said, adding that "there were no signs of foul 
play, no obvious signs of trauma to the body." 
</P>
<P>
Reid would not comment on whether drugs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said an autopsy would be 
performed today, but results of toxicological tests would not be known for a 
week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum was adopted by David McCallum, star of the former TV series "The Man 
From U.N.C.L.E.," and Ireland in 1962, according to Ireland's book. After the 
couple divorced, Ireland married actor Charles Bronson. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Jonas, spokeswoman for Ireland, said the actress was flying to Los Angeles 
on Wednesday from her Vermont home. 
</P>
<P>
"She's making no comment until she knows the cause of death," Jonas said. "They 
don't know if this was a drug overdose or a medical problem." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, Ireland, released this statement: 
</P>
<P>
"I hate drugs. Jason had shown signs of being on the road to recovery. The book 
meant a lot to Jason, and he hoped it would keep other young people from going 
through what he had gone through." 
</P>
<P>
David McCallum could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A friend, who asked not to be identified, said the tall, dark-haired McCallum 
was a "shy, very withdrawn" young man who, except for occasional acting jobs 
playing bit parts, did not work. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to be supported financially by Ireland and Bronson, the friend 
added, though just two days ago McCallum told him: "I'm going to find a job 
next week." 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't unhappy. I would rule out his taking his own life," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum had moved into the apartment only about a week ago, the friend said, 
with his new girlfriend, Medina. 
</P>
<P>
In "Life Lines," Ireland said McCallum had had troubles since his teens with 
cocaine, alcohol and heroin, and made numerous failed attempts at 
rehabilitation. His recurring addictions seemed to parallel Ireland's own 
recurring struggles with cancer, which she contracted five years ago. But she 
wrote that of the two battles, Jason's was more painful to her than her own. 
</P>
<P>
"I suddenly knew what it meant when people wrote that someone's heart breaks," 
she wrote of the moment when she learned her son was a heroin addict. "I felt 
as if mine were shattered. It gave me more pain and fear than when I learned I 
had cancer. I could fight for my own life. But even with all the energy and 
force I could muster, I realized I would get nowhere in this battle unless 
Jason fought harder." 
</P>
<P>
At a publication party for the book last April, however, McCallum told a 
reporter that he had spent a month in a recovery program and had been clean and 
sober for two months. According to others, however, McCallum did go back on 
drugs after that. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks, he had been under the care of a Los Angeles internist, Dr. 
Howard Mark. Mark said he treated McCallum for "poly drug abuse" with 
buprenorphine, a Federal Drug Administration-approved drug that he said recent 
studies have shown has promise for detoxification from opiate and cocaine 
addiction. McCallum had made remarkable progress within two weeks, Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice person, with a great sense of humor," the physician said 
Wednesday. "I said to myself, this guy has a chance. He's only 27. I don't know 
what happened."

CONTAMINATED HAY BLAMED FOR MYSTERY HORSE DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
State agriculture officials Wednesday blamed hay cubes contaminated with a 
botulism bacteria for the mystifying deaths of at least 15 horses in stables 
across Southern California over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests confirmed that from two to three pounds of the candy bar-sized 
cubes, collected at a San Bernardino County stable where three horses died, 
contained remains of a rabbit that may have carried the bacteria, officials 
said in a news conference at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that the puzzling malady came to light Oct. 28, and in the space 
of a few days claimed the lives of seven horses. Two other horses at the center 
have been stricken with similar symptoms -- quivering muscles, difficulty 
breathing and dull eyes -- but remained alive Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and local veterinarians, encouraged that no new cases have been 
reported since Tuesday, expressed optimism that the crisis that had alarmed 
stable owners and equestrians has ended. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day that passes with no reports of new victims is a positive sign that we 
may have isolated the problem," said Irvine veterinarian John Byrd, who treated 
the sick horses at the Costa Mesa equestrian center. "For the first time in a 
week, we're feeling better." 
</P>
<P>
In all, officials said that 15 horses have died -- seven in Orange County, 
three in Chino, three in Los Angeles County and two in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators focused on the possibility of botulism after eliminating other 
potential culprits such as rabies, strychnine, heavy metals, pesticides or 
infectious viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Thompson, a state Department of Food and Agriculture veterinarian, said 
hay cubes had been fed to each of the afflicted horses. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, veterinarians had suspected botulism, a type of food poisoning. But 
it was not confirmed until cubes from the Prado Park Stables in Chino were 
analyzed and animal remains were found. 
</P>
<P>
The tainted cubes, Thompson said, were processed in Utah, where the hay was cut 
and then compressed into pellets by a harvesting combine. Thompson said the 
rabbit may have been caught in the harvesting machinery, then shredded and 
pressed into the cubes.

LACK OF VOLUNTEERS MAY HURT AIDS DRUG TRIALS;

HEALTH: ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS OFTEN HAVE ACCESS TO NEW MEDICATIONS THROUGH OTHER

There are early signs that AIDS researchers conducting formal clinical trials 
of the newest antiviral drug DDI may be having a difficult time finding 
eligible volunteers, a circumstance that they attribute in part to the 
widespread availability of the drug through other newly approved channels, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS researchers who attended a three-day closed meeting at the National 
Institutes of Health that ended Wednesday expressed serious concerns that many 
patients who may be eligible for the formal studies instead have qualified for 
DDI, or dideoxyinosine, under a new plan that allows distribution of the drug 
before human studies have proved it effective against the disease, according to 
sources who were present at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Their anxiety underscores the difficulty of achieving the balance between 
delivering potentially life-saving drugs to terminally ill patients as quickly 
as possible and the need to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of 
these drugs, which can only be achieved through traditional highly structured 
clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
When the decision to make drugs available to AIDS patients outside the formal 
scientific process was announced several months ago, many researchers said they 
were worried that people would not participate in formal trials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Than 100 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, fewer than 100 patients have been enrolled in the formal studies, 
while about 1,000 have signed up for the drug under the new mechanism, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers cautioned, however, that many of the centers conducting the 
formal studies have not yet begun to recruit patients and that a clearer 
picture should emerge within two weeks, once all the formal DDI studies are 
underway. "It may be too early to conclude that the trials are impaired," said 
one researcher who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "people are concerned," said another researcher who was there. 
"There are more people concerned now than there were several months ago. There 
is enough preliminary evidence to make people worried. I fear that the hype 
about DDI has been such that people are doing back-flips to get on it, one way 
or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, new drugs are not released until rigorous human studies have 
shown them to be both safe and effective, a process that typically takes 
several years. Further, these drugs usually were only available to patients who 
qualified for such trials. In a formal trial, one group is given the new drug 
and another is given something else for comparison purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, federal health officials, under increasing pressure 
by AIDS activists and others, have indicated their willingness to make 
promising but unproved drugs accessible earlier for life-threatening 
conditions, and have announced several routes for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
These include a proposal to establish less formal "parallel track" trials and 
the increased use of a designation known as the "Treatment IND", for 
"investigational new drug," both of which would enable patients to receive 
drugs while the drugs are still being formally studied. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would make DDI 
available to certain AIDS patients under the IND designation, which makes a 
drug available for "compassionate use." In the parallel track trials, there 
would not be a comparison arm, and it would include those patients who could 
not qualify for entry into traditional trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going to happen but everyone is watching it; we're 
following it very closely," said Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the division of 
AIDS for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which 
sponsors the formal AIDS clinical trials program. 
</P>
<P>
"The (IND) started before the research track -- it had a head start. We would 
have preferred that they had started together. There is a tremendous pent-up 
demand, and those patients -- if they all go in one direction -- once they're 
gone, they're gone. That's not to say there's nobody left. But it does mean we 
may be losing the opportunity to accrue patients into the research trials," 
Hoth said. 
</P>
<P>
Another scientist at the session, which was a regularly scheduled meeting of 
researchers who belong to the 46 units of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, which 
are funded by NIAID to conduct trials of potential AIDS therapies, said: "you 
can have accrual problems with any trial." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "If we see a continuous increase in the numbers of patients in 
the Treatment IND for DDI" without a corresponding increase in the numbers 
participating in the trials, "then we would have to worry that the IND was a 
mistake. We have to achieve a scientific evaluation of DDI if the drug is to 
have a future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allergic to AZT 
</P>
<P>
Under the IND, all patients who cannot medically tolerate AZT, the only 
approved antiviral AIDS drug, will automatically receive DDI. There are three 
formal DDI trials scheduled, which require a total of more than 2,000 
participants. Two of the three clinical trials are intended to compare DDI to 
AZT. A third trial would compare two different doses of DDI among individuals 
who cannot take AZT. 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials have insisted all along that individuals who were 
otherwise eligible for formal trials would not be allowed access to the drug 
through other channels. However, at the NIH meeting this week, some researchers 
suggested that the entry criteria for the formal studies may be too strict, 
enabling patients to use the easier alternative to get the drug, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are asking for more flexibility," one researcher said. "It's too easy 
to rule someone out and lose him to parallel track. We may have to loosen up 
the rules a little to attract the patients." 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the formal studies is designed to determine whether 
individuals who develop anemia taking AZT do better with DDI. To be eligible 
for the formal study, an individual must demonstrate that AZT has reduced the 
oxygen-carrying capacity of his blood by more than 40%, as measured through his 
level of hemoglobin. 
</P>

"Many physicians would stop AZT before a patient's hemoglobin got that low, or 
give him a blood transfusion, so he would not qualify for the formal trial," 
one researcher said. "Also, if the physician has the option of getting his 
patient on DDI in a Treatment IND -- which is easier than getting him into a 
formal trial -- that's what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, in these circumstances, an individual might "never even know" 
that he qualified for a clinical trial and would not be motivated to find out 
since the drug was available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are anxious to do is to make sure that if someone is eligible for a 
DDI trial, that the trial is the route he takes to get that drug," the 
researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The NIAID's Hoth said that NIAID would continue to monitor the situation 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely critical to allow us to tell whether the (IND and proposed 
parallel track) is adversely impacting the research," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that the competing tracks will benefit the formal 
research.

SECORD PLEADS GUILTY TO PERJURY, WILL COOPERATE

<P>
The guilty plea Wednesday of Iran-Contra figure Richard V. Secord was hailed by 
federal prosecutors as closing an important chapter in their yearslong 
investigation of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Reid H. Weingarten, who was to try Secord on 12 felony charges beginning next 
Monday, told reporters that the former Air Force major general's admission that 
he lied to Congress in 1987 was "a significant step in this office's effort to 
expeditiously and fully complete its work." 
</P>
<P>
Weingarten's boss, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said in a separate 
statement that Secord's plea "brings within an adequate range of punishment one 
of the principal participants in the Iran-Contra diversion." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the plea bargain disclosed in federal court, Secord, 56, who 
assisted former White House aide Oliver L. North in supplying weapons to 
Nicaragua's rebels, pleaded guilty to one felony count of lying to Congress in 
return for dismissal of the 11 other counts in his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
He also agreed to "cooperate fully" with Walsh's office by testifying at future 
trials or grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The principal two trials remaining are those of former White House National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North's one-time superior, starting next 
Jan. 22, and Albert A. Hakim, Secord's former business partner, whose trial 
date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Secord's plea places Hakim under new pressure to enter a plea 
himself. Officials would not comment on whether such a plea is expected today 
at a pretrial hearing for Hakim. Richard Janis, Hakim's attorney, declined to 
discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., who accepted Secord's plea, 
set no immediate date for sentencing him. But he reminded Secord that he faces 
a maximum possible term of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers familiar with plea bargains said that Secord got a standard settlement 
-- admitting one felony count in return for dismissal of the remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Most judges make sentences on additional counts run concurrently anyway, so 
the government benefits whenever it gets someone to plead to a felony without 
the risks and expenses that a trial entails," one attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation of the Watergate scandal in the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration, it was standard procedure for special prosecutors to try to 
negotiate guilty pleas to one felony, with the understanding that such 
defendants would testify for the government against others. 
</P>
<P>
Watergate figures who accepted such plea bargains included former White House 
aides John W. Dean III and Egil (Bud) Krogh Jr. and former Nixon campaign 
officials Herbert L. Porter and Frederick C. LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the Iran-Contra investigation, Robert C. McFarlane -- another former 
national security adviser to former President Ronald Reagan -- was required to 
plead guilty to four separate charges of misleading Congress. But they were 
misdemeanors rather than felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, judges try to encourage the settlement of criminal cases by 
giving more lenient sentences to defendants who plead guilty. Plea bargains 
save the government the time and expense of trying every defendant who is 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
At his court appearance, Secord told Judge Robinson that he had lied by 
responding "no" when congressional investigators asked him under oath: "Are you 
aware of any money from the Enterprise (North's code word for the Iran-Contra 
operation) which went to the benefit of Mr. North?" 
</P>
<P>
Standing erect before Robinson with hands clasped behind his back, Secord said 
he gave his false answer "in a misguided effort . . . to protect Mr. North and 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said in court papers that "if called to prove this (perjury) 
allegation at trial, the government would prove that defendant (Secord) knew 
that, in fact, money from the Enterprise went to North's benefit as the result 
of defendant's purchase of a security system costing in excess of $13,000 and 
the establishment of a secret account containing $200,000 in Switzerland for 
North" for the education of his children. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing the venal side of the Iran-Contra case, the government's court filing 
said further that Secord personally had received $1.5 million in profits from 
the sale of weapons to Iran and the Contras. It added that Hakim "received 
profits in comparable amounts." 
</P>
<P>
A federal court jury last May convicted North on three of 12 felony counts, 
including his acceptance of a $13,800 gratuity from Secord, an electronic 
security fence at his Virginia home. 
</P>
<P>
North was not charged with accepting the $200,000 education fund, although it 
figured in trial testimony. Prosecutors said in their new filing that Secord 
had informed North in 1986 that he and Hakim had established such a fund. 
</P>
<P>
Secord and Hakim gave these gifts to North "at least in part to thank him for 
providing lucrative financial opportunities" for them, prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Green, Secord's attorney, replied that the home security system was 
"not an attempt to thank Col. North." Rather, Secord paid for the installation 
"to respond to threats against Col. North's life and his family's security," 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, was one of 
four major figures in the Iran-Contra scandal to be indicted in March of last 
year for their roles in selling arms to Iran and diverting some profits to 
Nicaragua's rebels. Oliver L. North, a White House aide, was convicted of three 
of 12 felony counts, fined and sentenced to 1,200 hours of community service 
for his role in the scandal. The trial of North's White House boss, John M. 
Poindexter, is scheduled for Jan. 22. No trial date has been set for the fourth 
defendant, businessman Albert A. Hakim.

Jordanians voted in their first general election in 22 years, a parliamentary 
contest that included women for the first time. An Interior Ministry spokesman 
said that at least 62% of the 877,000 eligible voters cast ballots. A broad 
range of candidates demanded the end of martial law, formal legalization of 
political parties and greater press freedom, as well as support of the 
Palestinian uprising on the West Bank. Unofficial returns are expected by 
Thursday.

A newspaper said the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl power plant, the worst 
commercial nuclear accident in history, took 250 lives instead of the 31 
officially reported. A brief article in the weekly Moscow News said deaths not 
reported by authorities were caused by various illnesses related to the 
accident. But a spokesman for the agency overseeing the Chernobyl cleanup said 
that only the 31 deaths officially reported could be traced directly to the 
accident.

The earthquake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17 caused little or no 
damage to most of the 102 dams within 50 miles of its epicenter, state 
engineers reported. The most severe cracking was to the Austrian Dam on Lake 
Elsman, owned by the San Jose Water Co., seven miles south-southeast of Los 
Gatos and about eight miles from the epicenter, they said. Engineers conducted 
the survey for the Division of Safety of Dams, which is in the Department of 
Water Resources. Repairs are in progress at the Austrian Dam and will begin 
shortly at several other dams in the area owned by the Santa Clara Valley Water 
District. They are Lexington Dam, two miles south of Los Gatos; Vasona Dam, two 
miles north of Los Gatos, and Guadalupe Dam, five miles southeast of Los Gatos. 
Minor longitudinal cracking was discovered at Newell Dam, owned by the city of 
Santa Cruz, nine miles southwest of Los Gatos.

The earthquake-damaged San Francisco Bay Bridge is scheduled to be reopened to

Caltrans informed Gov. George Deukmejian. "The speedy reopening of the Bay 
Bridge symbolizes to the world that the Bay Area has bounced back from the 
tragic earthquake," the governor said. Department of Transportation Director 
Bob Best warned that inclement weather, or other unforeseen complications, 
could delay the date, but he is proceeding with plans to reopen the span Nov. 
17. Best also cautioned that earthquake-related difficulties still exist on the 
related 280,480 and 880 freeways.

Folsom Prison reported that an estimated 13,500 gallons of raw sewage drained 
into the American River last week. Warden R. G. Borg said inmates in the old 
section of the prison apparently clogged a sewer line with plastic wrap, bags, 
towels and torn sheets. The sewage came up out of a manhole just inside one of 
the gates, ran down a street, out the gate and into a sewer drain. Borg said 
blueprints showed that the drain led to a sanitary sewer, but that was wrong. 
An interceptor line drained to a storm sewer that ends at the river. It was the 
third raw sewage spill from the prison this year. A fourth spill was of treated 
sewage.

<P>
NOTED BOOK COLLECTION, ONE OF WORLD'S BEST, BEING SOLD OFF BY EX-CALTECH 
PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 40 years, Ned Munger stalked books about Africa the way safari 
hunters stalk big game. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the thrill was in the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Once, while crawling on his hands and knees along the cold concrete-floor 
basement of a Zurich bookshop in the early 1960s, the former Caltech professor 
heard what sounded like a huge rat gnawing at a book. 
</P>
<P>
He peered cautiously into the next aisle. And there was his old pal Nnamdi 
Azikwe, then-president of Nigeria, also on his hands and knees, gazing intently 
at contents on the dusty lower shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"He, too, knew that hit-and-miss collectors will often . . . leave the real 
gems unmined on the less-convenient lower shelves," Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It took Munger more than four decades of haunting bookstores on six continents 
to build up a collection of 45,000 volumes on Africa, the largest such private 
library in the United States, says Moore Crossey, curator of the African 
Collection at Yale University's library. 
</P>
<P>
But the professor retired last year and Caltech, which housed the books, says 
it can no longer accommodate his library. Neither can Munger, whose Pasadena 
home will hold only a fraction of his collection. 
</P>
<P>
So Munger, 67, has been forced to break up what many scholars have called a 
unique cultural resource. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was invaluable," said Richard L. Sklar, a professor of political 
science at UCLA and former president of the Atlanta-based national African 
Studies Assn. "I'm so sorry to hear it's being broken up. So many scholars have 
used it from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
At first Munger had hoped to sell his library in one piece, but many 
universities already owned some tomes and didn't want to duplicate their 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
He donated about 8,900 books to Caltech. Several hundred more were sold at a 
discount to Occidental College and Pasadena City College. Others were purchased 
by antiquarian book dealers in far-flung places like Sydney, Australia, and 
Johannesburg, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is down to one-quarter of his original collection. Another 1,000 of his 
rarest books will go on the auction block beginning todayat Sotheby's in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Munger did not reveal how much the books have sold for, but he noted that one 
bookseller said the estimated worth of the entire collection "probably 
approaches seven figures." 
</P>
<P>
Munger says he has few regrets about breaking up his collection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when a child grows up and goes to college; it's a part of life," 
says Munger, who hopes his 45,000 "children" will all find good homes. 
</P>
<P>
One of Munger's most prized possessions is a scrap of paper that bears what the 
professor calls the only known signature of Cetywayo, the last great King of 
the Zulus, who trounced the British in South Africa in 1879, wiping out an 
entire British regiment. 
</P>
<P>
When a later Zulu king visited Munger, and saw the rare signature, "he broke 
into tears" Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Munger's library includes rare political pamphlets written in 1912 by South 
African communists. It also includes first editions of "Cry The Beloved 
Country," by the anti-apartheid South African author Alan Paton, a friend of 
Munger. 
</P>
<P>
It includes 15th-Century illuminated manuscripts on vellum written in Geez, the 
liturgical language of the 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Coptic Church; there is a letter signed by Dr. David Livingstone 
dated 1861 and a document signed by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who 
sailed around the Cape of Good Hope to India in the late 1490s, opening the 
first all-water trade route between Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
One collection that Munger didn't snap up was a cache of 200 letters that 
Mahatma Gandhi wrote to an architect friend while living in Durban. At $20,000, 
Munger thought it too pricey. But he often sought out rare publications and 
manuscripts that dealt with the history of the Indian people in Africa, who 
"played an extremely important role in developing the economic history of East 
Africa," Munger says. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s, when he was growing up in Chicago, however, Munger didn't 
know Durban from Timbuktu. But he did have a penchant for book collecting, 
often trading candy to neighborhood children in exchange for books. 
</P>
<P>
Some years later, while he was in the Army, Munger showed an aptitude for 
poker. When he hit the jackpot one night in 1947, he took his winnings and 
headed for West Africa -- a place that had long conjured up visions of exotic 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a lifelong fascination with Africa, one that led eventually to a 
doctorate in political geography from the University of Chicago, a role in 
founding the national African Studies Assn. and a 14-year stint as president of 
the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, the Pasadena-based organization founded by 
archeologists Louis and Mary Leakey which supports scientific research into the 
origins of man. 
</P>
<P>
While completing his Ph.D and looking for an academic home, Munger realized 
that few libraries in the United States had sizable Africana collections. Bent 
on teaching students about Africa, he decided to build up a collection that 
could both serve as a teaching tool and make him a welcome addition to any 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
When Caltech offered him one of its few humanities professorships in 1959, he 
agreed, so long as he could take along his "laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
During the decades that he taught "The Politics of Africa" to science majors at 
Caltech, Munger's podium served as a revolving door for visiting lecturers that 
included the foreign minister of Tanzania, the president of Gambia, and South 
African critics of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Munger has met just about every important person in recent African 
history, including the noted Nigerian social realist writer Chinua Achebe and 
the notorious tyrant and former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who had been a 
bellboy in a hotel where Munger once stayed in Kampala. Amin, an amateur boxer, 
was so big and brutish that he could knock out two men at once, and proved it 
during fights that the British set up, Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After 76 trips to Africa, Munger concludes that "the people are the most 
exciting in West Africa, the scenery is the most inspiring in East Africa and 
the problems are the most challenging in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Book collecting proved challenging too, an occupation ill-suited for weak-kneed 
bookworms. 
</P>
<P>
Munger says he has been shot at by a Cuban MIG fighter plane in Angola and held 
upside-down over a cliff in Sao Tome -- an island in the South Atlantic -- by 
Portuguese secret police who mistook him for a revolutionary. Another close 
call came in 1960 when the Belgians began pulling out of the Congo (now Zaire). 
Munger was walking down the street with an Israeli colonel in Leopoldville -- 
now Kinshasa -- when, briefly after parting ways, the colonel was shot in the 
head by guerrilla snipers. 
</P>
<P>
Bibliophiles say Munger himself played an important role in African 
scholarship, beginning with his doctoral thesis: a history of Monrovia, the 
capital of Liberia, the African country founded in 1847 by freed U.S. slaves. 
</P>
<P>
Munger's library "has a lot of unique, interesting and very, very scarce 
political material, especially about South Africa," said Crossey, curator of 
Yale's African Collection. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Munger devotes most of his time to the Cape of Good Hope Foundation, a 
Pasadena-based organization he founded in 1984 to provide college educations in 
South Africa to promising poor and underprivileged minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some academics who have enhanced their own collections with Munger's 
books are of two minds about the dismantling of his library. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, it's a pity because it was put together by the vision of one 
individual," said Gerald J. Bender, director of the school of international 
relations at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, "If it's going to be better utilized, then perhaps that should 
be its fate."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DECISION ON WATER RATE HIKE PUT OFF FOR 60 
DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual break with the Department of Water and Power, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday balked at approving a 6.5% water rate increase 
requested by the department. 
</P>
<P>
In an 8-7 vote, the council again put off action on the increase for 60 days to 
gather more information. It is the second time in recent weeks the council has 
put off making a decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP request became controversial after the city's administrative officer 
issued a report saying the increase is not needed because the department has a 
$30-million surplus. DWP officials have argued that they need the money to 
maintain a high bond rating. 
</P>
<P>
Under the department's recommendation, the average monthly residential water 
bill of $21.26 would be increased by $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials have predicted that if the council denies the increase 
this year, consumers will face double-digit rate increases in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members on Wednesday asked that the DWP and the administrative 
office attempt to reach an agreement about whether the hike is necessary, but 
Norman Nichols, DWP general manager, argued that he -- not the city's 
administrative officer -- has the sole responsibility to recommend increases 
under the city Charter. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're telling me is that I can take it or leave it," responded 
Councilman Hal Bernson. "Well, I can leave it. That's OK."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER, GIRLFRIEND CHARGED IN ABUSE OF 
DAUGHTER, 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and his live-in girlfriend have been charged with seven counts each of 
felony child abuse for allegedly beating and hog-tying the man's 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Venus Berthomieux and Martha Germany, both 30, face up to six years in prison 
on each charge if convicted, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
Berthomieux pleaded not guilty to all counts Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court. Germany's arraignment is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested Oct. 14 after calling paramedics to report that the girl 
had accidentally swallowed rubbing alcohol at their home in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said they found the child malnourished and badly bruised. 
Police said bruises on the child indicted that she had been tied up. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency room doctor called it one of the worst cases of child abuse he had 
ever seen, investigators said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDENTS SKIP CLASS, RALLY TO BACK TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 125 San Marino High School students skipped their 1 p.m. class Wednesday 
to attend a rally supporting teachers' salary demands. But the crowd broke up 
peacefully 15 minutes later when the principal politely asked students to 
return to class. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have bright kids and they understand there are two sides to 
issues," said Principal Don Banderas, as he watched the last stragglers file 
back into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Students had unfurled banners and chanted "6%" in efforts to focus attention on 
the contract demands of their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like all my teachers, they're great teachers and I think they should get 
paid more," said Annie Wu, a 14-year-old freshman at San Marino, where about 
1,000 students are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
About 140 teachers in the San Marino School District have been working without 
a contract since the beginning of the 1988 school year. They are seeking a 6% 
increase retroactive to Sept. 1, 1988, said Jim Korkis, vice president of the 
San Marino Teachers Assn.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN REAL ESTATE SCAM RELEASED ON BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man accused of making tens of thousands of dollars by tricking 
homeowners into signing away title to their homes was released on $50,000 bail 
Wednesday after proving that the bail money did not come from any allegedly 
ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Gary L. Palmer told Municipal Judge David M. Horwitz that 
Palmer's mother, a retired county nurse, used her savings to post the bail. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer faces eight felony counts of grand theft and four counts of forgery 
stemming from a real estate scam in which he allegedly forged property deeds to 
transfer title into a straw buyer's name then took out loans on the properties. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was the subject of an Oct. 15 Times article on questionable real estate 
deals in which homeowners throughout Los Angeles County have lost title to 
their homes. Most of the victims are elderly or unsophisticated homeowners who 
bought their properties years ago, have all but paid them off and have 
substantial equity. 
</P>
<P>
Though charges were filed against him in August, Palmer was a fugitive until 
turning himself in last week. He has pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing 
was set for Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier telephone interview, Palmer, 24, denied the charges against him 
and said he had been "set up." 
</P>
<P>
Because Palmer's alleged crimes made money, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela J. Gelman 
used a provision of the state penal code to require that the defendant show 
that the money used for his defense is not "tainted." Gelman said Wednesday she 
was satisfied that the money was posted by Palmer's mother.

O.C. PREACHER PLEDGES NEW ANTI-GAY DRIVES; 
</P>
<P>
GAY RIGHTS: THE REV. LOUIS P. SHELDON SAYS HE WILL TURN HIS ENERGIES TO THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
</P>

<P>
The Orange County preacher who successfully supported ballot measures against 
gay rights in three California cities, including Irvine, vowed Wednesday to 
pursue additional campaigns to curb homosexual rights. 
</P>
<P>
"To give special rights to an insular distinct minority is pushing voters too 
far," said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of the Anaheim based-Traditional 
Values Coalition. "(People) are saying, 'Enough is enough. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's 53% to 47% approval of Irvine's Measure N, which repealed protections 
for gays from the city's 15-month-old broad anti-discrimination law, was one of 
three important defeats for gay rights issues in California Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Concord, east of San Francisco, voters repealed an ordinance barring 
discrimination against people with AIDS. And in perhaps the most surprising 
result, voters in San Francisco, by reputation the most tolerant of American 
cities, narrowly rejected a law that would have permitted unmarried "domestic 
partners" to register their relationships at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, who opposed gays in all three campaigns, made his comments at a news 
conference in Anaheim, where he basked in victory and pledged to take his 
crusade to California's schools. He said he will approach school districts 
throughout the state, beginning in Orange County, to make sure that teachers do 
not encourage homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
The election results, Sheldon declared, put politicians throughout the state on 
notice that voters do not believe that gays and lesbians deserve the same 
protection given to women and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
There were common threads in Tuesday's results. All three measures had been 
approved by local governments -- and all three were placed on the ballot by 
petition drives organized by fundamentalist Christians supported by Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of gay rights were stunned by their electoral shutout but rejected 
any sweeping conclusions about the future of the gay movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad and depressing day," said Carol Anderon, co-president of Lawyers 
for Human Rights in Los Angeles. She blamed "complacency" among gay voters 
following three statewide electoral victories over repressive AIDS initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bray, communications director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task 
Force, noted that the setbacks in California came the same week that the 
Massachusetts Legislature approved civil rights protections for gay men and 
lesbians in a bill that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has pledged to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's approval of Measure N by 11,482 votes to 10,328 removes the words 
sexual orientation from the city's human rights ordinance, which continues to 
ban discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age or 
physical handicap in housing, employment and public services. 
</P>
<P>
The mandate could signal trouble for Mayor Larry Agran and council members 
Cameron Cosgrove and Edward A. Dornan, who were vocally opposed to the 
initiative and who face reelection next June. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a black eye on Agran and the rest of the council," said Michael Shea, 
one of the leaders of the Irvine Values Coalition, which led the charge for 
Measure N. He pledged to support candidates who have "pro-family" views in the 
next election. 
</P>
<P>
But Agran said he doubted that passage of the measure would hurt him 
politically because the vote was close. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an issue people have decided early-on. Arguments have been 
passed back and forth, and the voters in Irvine have made up their mind and are 
very independent," Agran said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, who advocates that gays and lesbians should receive special therapy to 
change their "sexual behavior," said he helped the measure's proponents plan 
their campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Values Coalition focused on portraying homosexuals as child 
molesters and "recruiters" to the gay community in the Yes-on-N campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights advocates, however, accused the Irvine traditional values group of 
pursuing a "vile," negative campaign that they said confused voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The passage of Measure N was not, as our opponents have claimed, a victory for 
family values. It was a victory for intolerance," said the Rev. Fred Plumer, a 
member of Citizens United, the group opposing the measure. "It was a victory 
for fear and hatred and a temporary setback for compassion and human concern." 
</P>
<P>
Agran said he does not plan to try to push for another measure or city action 
to reinstate the section of the ordinance. Under Measure N, that would be a 
more difficult task because voter approval is now needed for reinstatement of 
gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who voted for the ordinance in 1988 but who 
was the sole council member to declare neutrality on the initiative, said the 
Measure N victory could spell future defeats for Agran. 
</P>
<P>
"People voted against Larry, rather than the issue," said Sheridan, who has 
formed an exploratory committee for her own campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Uribe, a lesbian teacher who started Project 10 at Fairfax High School 
in Los Angeles, the country's first support group for gay students within a 
school, predicted that Sheldon will eventually spread himself too thin on too 
many issues he opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The more vocal and discriminatory these people get, the more people are 
willing to work harder to fight him. He is a very vocal person who stirs up 
inflammatory rhetoric," Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, as gays assessed damage to their cause Wednesday, businessman 
Jack Bellingham said he was "serving notice that there is an entity as strong 
as or stronger than the gay voting block in San Francisco: conservatives and 
religious people who believe in traditional family values." 
</P>
<P>
The Domestic Partners law, which was unanimously approved by the Board of 
Supervisors earlier this year and signed by Mayor Art Agnos, was defeated by a 
razor-thin margin of fewer than 2,000 votes, 50.5% to 49.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos vowed to "come back again and again" with similar legislation. Harry 
Britt, the city's openly gay president of the Board of Supervisors and the 
measure's principal sponsor, said it is "a false perception" that gay power is 
waning in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Pabich, the political consultant who engineered the campaign in favor of 
the law, blamed relatively low voter turnout in an off-year election for the 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The repeal of the AIDS bias ordinance in Concord by a margin of 56% to 44% 
surprised local public health officials. It was the the first such referendum 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard lesson when fear and hate prevail, but I'm afraid that's the 
lesson we've learned," said Francie Wise, director of communicable disease 
control for Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that everyone from President Bush to former Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop had embraced civil rights protection for people with AIDS and 
those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Lloyd Mashore, who helped lead the repeal campaign and rode it to a 
seat on Concord's council, had attacked the law as "a homosexual agenda 
presented in camouflaged, palatable anti-discrimination language." 
</P>
<P>

writer Mark I. Pinsky also contributed to this story from Orange County.

heading to Washington this weekend for a national conference to discuss gay 
politics. They'll "tell their story of how it didn't work," said National Gay

<P>
Ernie Schneider, a 20-year veteran of Orange County government, marathon runner 
and head of the county's powerful Environmental Management Agency, was chosen 
Wednesday to be the county's new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, 42, will be formally named as the county administrative officer at 
the board meeting next Tuesday. A West German immigrant who arrived in New York 
a few weeks shy of his sixth birthday, he won out over four other top county 
officials who were finalists for the job. In all, 12 county executives 
submitted applications for one of the highest-paying government jobs in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors, who unanimously selected Schneider after shelving plans for a 
national search, hailed him Wednesday as a consensus builder with a keen 
knowledge of the intricacies of Orange County government and able to get a 
handle on the county's escalating financial woes. Part of Schneider's pitch for 
the job included a broad plan to restructure county government, interviews 
indicated. But one critic complained that he was too much of an insider and too 
close to developer interests. 
</P>
<P>
Board members declined to discuss specifics of his proposals but acknowledged 
that his suggestions for streamlining county operations and keeping board 
members better informed on fiscal matters played a key role in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking about a budget of $3 billion, we need to have continuing 
monitoring of where we've been and where we're going so we don't run into 
periods of panic, which those of us in county government are very familiar 
with," Supervisor Don R. Roth said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to read in your paper that the county is going to lay off three 
or four hundred people. I want to know about it ahead of time. . . . I just 
think he's one of the best men for the job." 
</P>
<P>
The other finalists for the job were Transportation Commission Director Stanley 
T. Oftelie, Associate CAO John Sibley, Fire Chief Lawrence J. Holms and Chief 
Probation Officer Michael A. Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider will replace retiring CAO Larry Parrish, who as the 
fourth-highest-paid county administrative officer in California, earns $129,910 
a year. Schneider's salary is under negotiation as is his official start date. 
Parrish is scheduled to retire in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider declined to discuss specifics of plans for streamlining county 
operations but said his first action would be to meet with the heads of all 
county departments. He said he plans to be more of a "hands-on" administrator 
than Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's selection drew a mixed, though mostly positive, reaction from 
environmentalists and community activists, many of whom have dealt with him on 
development issues during his three years at the Environmental Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Brown, president of the slow-growth-minded Laguna Greenbelt, credited 
Schneider with "opening up the process" at the agency and giving more serious 
consideration to the concerns of community activists. Shirley Grindle, a former 
planning commissioner who wrote TIN CUP, Orange County's campaign-contribution 
and lobbying regulations, also applauded the board's choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he can teach the board to say no" to development, Grindle said. Voters 
want a tough stance on development, which they clearly signaled Tuesday when 
they rejected Measure M, a half-cent sales tax that would have paid for 
transportation projects, Grindle declared. 
</P>
<P>
But Russell Burkett, chairman of the committee that successfully fought passage 
of Measure M, expressed dismay at the board's decision to drop a search outside 
the county for a new CAO. Burkett criticized Schneider as part of "an ol' boy 
network" of powerful developers and their advocates, noting Schneider's history 
of acquiring high-paying county appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider was an aide to former Supervisor Bruce Nestande when he was selected 
to head the EMA in December, 1986. Schneider, whose salary jumped by $20,000 to 
$80,000 a year with that appointment, beat four assistant EMA directors who had 
also applied for the job. Schneider was among three supervisors' aides to 
receive high-paying county jobs during a 15-month period. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think there's an incestuous relationship of people moving up the ladder 
. . . ," Burkett said. "They suffer from a disease called 
'don't-rock-the-boat-itis.' They all went to the same school of public 
management. They have a degree in getting along with developers."

SAN JUAN PLANS 'CENTRAL PARK' TO PROTECT ITS VANISHING OPEN SPACE

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled between Trabuco and Oso creeks lies an undisturbed piece of yesteryear, 
where wooden farmhouses and fruit stands can still be found under the shade of 
majestic eucalyptus and live oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
It is the northern entrance to this historic city, a rural buffer zone that 
separates the traditional home of the swallows from the increasingly urban 
landscape that marks neighboring Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
But, city officials warn, residential and commercial developers are already 
wooing owners with promises of high returns in exchange for the 120-acre 
agricultural preserve -- a quiet refuge of orange groves and persimmon patches 
along Camino Capistrano, north of Junipero Serra Road. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to maintain the area in its current state, city officials will today 
unveil an ambitious plan for a $20-million bond issue to purchase the preserve 
and transform it into a city-owned "Central Park." 
</P>
<P>
At an 11:30 a.m. press conference, to be held on the proposed park site, city 
officials are expected to announce that they are considering calling a special 
April election. The bond sale needs approval by two-thirds of the city's 
registered voters, according to Michael McNamara, a private financial 
consultant hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond sale is approved, property owners would be assessed an average of 
$5.83 per month for the next 20 years, McNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said city officials envision a sprawling park with 
tree-lined walkways, horse paths and baseball and soccer fields, all anchored 
by a community and senior center. The plan would also preserve some of the 
agricultural land and orange trees in community garden settings. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, Hausdorfer said, is another example of San Juan Capistrano's 
commitment to keep the city as rural as possible in the fast-developing South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"San Juan has a long history of caring about values more than economics," he 
said. "This is open space that cannot be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Citing Tuesday's failure of Measure M, a half-cent sales tax measure for 
transportation improvements, Hausdorfer conceded that efforts to raise taxes in 
the county do not appear to be popular. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "San Juan (residents) have had a long history of saying: 'We're 
different, and we're going to do some things differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some property owners in the proposed park area have long been critical of the 
city-imposed agricultural preserve category, which prevents them from 
developing the property unless it is sold. They were skeptical that the city 
would raise enough money to succeed with the park idea, which was first raised 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to buy any 120 acres with $20 million," said John Swanner, 
68, who owns 38 acres of the farmland along with his brother and two cousins. 
"They've been talking about doing this for years." 
</P>
<P>
Swanner and other landowners have complained that the agricultural preserve 
category, which went into effect in 1977, has limited their options on how they 
can best use their property. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they say, they are losing thousands of dollars by paying 
rising property-tax assessments for land that is not producing sufficient 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40 property owners who have shares in four separate farming 
estates in the proposed park area. Many of the owners are related to the 
original farmers who first planted the orange groves in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers have held the land (rather than sell it to developers), and 
they've been the losers because of it," said Bill Bathgate, a caretaker and 
part owner of some of the preserve land. "They've waited patiently for the city 
. . . to put it crudely . . . to put up or shut up." 
</P>
<P>
Developers who purchase the property would have to apply to the city to remove 
the agricultural preserve restrictions but could then develop the property, 
according to city zoning law. 
</P>
<P>
The idea to carve the city's only large park out of the farmland was first 
proposed by the Planning Commission in 1975. Under the proposal, the City 
Council was asked to approve a bond purchase to acquire 136 acres of farmland 
at a cost ranging from $4 million to $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected the plan by a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"City policy (at that time) was to continue with an agricultural use," said 
former councilman Roy Byrnes, who favored purchasing the land through the sale 
of bonds. "After that, the decision to do a bond was never forced on the city." 
</P>
<P>
The farming area is one of two large undeveloped parcels left in the city. The 
other farm area is bounded by Alipaz Street, Camino del Avion and Del Obispo 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also studying that parcel of land for purchase to protect it 
against future development. 
</P>
<P>
The series of ridgelines that wind through the city have also been permanently 
protected from development by city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said if the land were to be developed by private companies, they 
would have to pay up to $50 million to shore up the eroding creek beds that 
converge on the southern tip of the agricultural preserve. 
</P>
<P>
They would also have to provide a safe crossing for the Atchinson, Topeka &amp; 
Santa Fe Railway tracks, which bisect the land.

REGIONAL JAIL PROPOSED BY SUPERVISOR; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: A JOINTLY RUN FACILITY IN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DESERT EAST OF INDIO 
IS SUGGESTED TO SOLVE ORANGE COUNTY'S JAIL OVERCROWDING CRISIS AND SITING 
TURMOIL.

<P>
To alleviate jail overcrowding in Orange County, Supervisor Don R. Roth on 
Wednesday proposed establishing a regional jail authority that would build and 
operate a multicounty prison facility in southeastern Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who said he has discussed the plan in a series of private meetings with a 
Riverside County supervisor, said the facility would house long-term Orange 
County inmates serving sentences ranging from two months to a year -- at a 
potential cost savings of as much as $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, it would be built and operated jointly by Orange, Riverside and 
possibly other interested counties under a Southern California Regional Jail 
Authority. One site that could be considered is near Eagle Mountain, 55 miles 
east of Indio and north of the Salton Sea. It would be the first jail in 
California to be jointly operated by two counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The regional jail approach represents our best chance to solve Orange County's 
jail overcrowding crisis in a cost-effective manner with popular support," Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a facility, according to Roth's staff, could eliminate the need for a 
planned county jail in Gypsum Canyon, a facility to be built east of Anaheim 
Hills that he and another supervisor have opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was immediately criticized by Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad 
Gates, who said the county's jail overcrowding problems would not be solved "by 
moving it (the jail) to someone else's back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, while saying he had few details about the plan, said it is fraught with 
legal and logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You are talking about a four-hour drive each way. That's eight hours a trip," 
he said. "It's mind-boggling." He said serious problems of administration and 
staffing of such a jail could be serious barriers. The county already has spent 
$7 million in planning for the Gypsum Canyon jail, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who also opposes the Gypsum Canyon jail site, 
which is in his district, said the Riverside County proposal is certainly worth 
exploring, but he warned there are legal barriers to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Roth disclosed Wednesday that he has held a series of private meetings on the 
plan with Riverside County Supervisor Patricia (Corky) Larson over the last 
year. The proposal has received her support, said Roth's aide, Dan Wooldridge. 
Larson was not available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For years the county has been struggling with finding a site for a new jail to 
relieve overcrowding in the present facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, in a letter to other supervisors, said, "We need to search out every new 
alternative which solves part of the jail overcrowding problem while 
circumventing the passionate opposition to siting a local facility." The 
proposal did not mention methods of raising money for building and operating a 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) said he is supportive of the 
multiple-county jail concept but warned that the Eagle Mountain location "might 
not get off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
He said the area already has a state minimum-security facility that is being 
increased from 200 to 400 inmates, and there have been other proposals to use 
the area for the disposal of trash from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people out there are getting a little tired of it all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Presley, who has carried major crime and prison legislation, said he had been 
encouraging counties to look at regional solutions to some of their problems. 
He said state bond money might even be available for such a regional facility. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) said he supported the concept of regional 
county jails in the Legislature. But he said there are difficult problems that 
have to be overcome such as who would control the jail and be responsible for 
the staffing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this stuff can be worked out," said Seymour, a former mayor of Anaheim 
who also opposes the Gypsum Canyon jail site. 
</P>
<P>
County officials noted that there is a railroad track that runs from Santa Ana 
to within miles of the proposed site for the joint jail facility. 
</P>
<P>
But even Roth was cautious: "A joint powers agency in another county may prove 
to be a complex legal and operational challenge. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Roth will ask the full board Tuesday to: 
</P>
<P>
* Approve in concept the feasibility of a regional jail facility for meeting 
the county's jail needs. 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the County Administrative Office to evaluate and review the regional 
jail concept and report back in 180 days, identifying the major issues, 
alternatives and costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the County Administrative Office to study the feasibility of 
establishing a Southern California Regional Jail Authority. 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the County Administrative Office to provide reports to the board every 
60 days concerning a regional jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this effort will result in a potentially more cost-effective and 
remote site to house long-term inmates," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony C. Hughes, vice president in charge of public finance for The First 
Boston Company, said his firm, which has worked for both Orange and Riverside 
counties in bond funding matters, did a feasibility study on a joint jail for 
Orange and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The cost savings, Hughes said, were estimated at $80 million to $120 million. 
But others, including Sheriff Gates, contended that construction of a jail is 
only a small part of the larger ongoing operational costs.

BOTULISM-TAINTED HAY CUBES BLAMED IN 15 HORSE DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State agriculture officials Wednesday blamed hay cubes contaminated with a 
botulism bacteria for the mystifying deaths of at least 15 horses in stables 
across Southern California over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests confirmed that from two to three pounds of the candy bar-size 
cubes, collected at a San Bernardino County stable where three horses died, 
contained remains of a rabbit that may have carried the bacteria, officials 
confirmed during a news conference at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that the puzzling malady came to light Oct. 28, and in the space 
of a few days claimed the lives of seven horses. Two other horses at the center 
have been stricken with similar symptoms -- quivering muscles, difficulty 
breathing and dull eyes -- but remained alive Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and local veterinarians, encouraged that no new cases have been 
reported since Tuesday, expressed optimism that the crisis that had alarmed 
stable owners and equestrians throughout Southern California has ended. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day that passes with no reports of new victims is a positive sign that we 
may have isolated the problem," said Irvine veterinarian John Byrd, who treated 
the sick horses at the Costa Mesa equestrian center. "For the first time in a 
week, we're feeling better." 
</P>
<P>
In all, officials said that 15 horses have died; seven in Orange County, three 
in Chino, three in Los Angeles County and two in Ventura County. Los Angeles 
County veterinarians initially estimated that three other deaths had occurred, 
but on Wednesday said that they had been mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators focused on the possibility of botulism after eliminating other 
potential culprits such as rabies, strychnine, heavy metals, pesticides or 
infectious viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Thompson, a state Department of Food and Agriculture veterinarian, said 
hay cubes had been fed to each of the afflicted horses. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, veterinarians had suspected botulism, a type of food poisoning. But 
it was not confirmed until cubes from the Prado Park Stables in Chino were 
analyzed and animal remains were found. 
</P>
<P>
The tainted cubes, Thompson said, were processed in Utah, where the hay was cut 
and then compressed into pellets by a large harvesting combine. Thompson said 
the rabbit may have been caught in the harvesting machinery, then shredded and 
pressed into the cubes. The resulting toxin secreted by the animal parts may 
have produced the botulism bacteria that was then passed on to the horses. The 
toxin strikes the nervous system, usually within 48 hours after being ingested. 
</P>
<P>
How many cubes have been tainted may never be known, Bryd said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the 30,000 tons that they have sent down here (from Utah), maybe 16 or 
17 are bad," he said. "We don't know if this is one load of cubes or an entire 
field of alfalfa." 
</P>
<P>
The cubes were manufactured and distributed by Paramount Cubing, in southeast 
Los Angeles County. But Thompson said state officials have taken no action 
against the firm, except to quarantine those cubes delivered by the company to 
stables reporting sick horses. 
</P>
<P>
To "firm up" the botulism theory, Thompson said testing of both the cubes and 
the stricken animals will continue. "Until proven otherwise, we believe that 
this is the cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the issue of whether the feed was prepared and shipped improperly 
has been turned over to the Feed, Fertilizer and Livestock Branch of the state 
agriculture department, the agency charged with regulating the animal feed 
industry. An spokesman said agency investigators have been dispatched to Utah 
to inspect the farms where the cubes are produced. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we have no reason to believe that anything improper has 
occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd said the strain of botulism bacteria detected in the cubes is commonly 
found in dogs, cats and aquatic birds, but is extremely rare in horses. The 
last known occurrence of this type of botulism in a horse was 10 years ago in 
Florida. There is no cure for the illness, and the bacterium is considered one 
of the deadliest types known to man, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"One contaminated cube is enough to kill a horse," said Byrd, adding that he is 
awaiting the arrival of several types of experimental serums to treat those 
horses still suffering. "But nobody has had much experience with this, so 
there's no track record of how successful it might be."

CITY COMMENDED FOR RECYCLING PLAN

<P>
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez commended the City Council for its 
"forward-looking and forward-thinking" automated recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to members of the council Tuesday night, Vasquez said Brea had taken a 
leadership role "in developing innovative methods of recycling." He presented 
Mayor Gene A. Leyton with a plaque from the county citing Brea's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, representatives of Brea Disposal Inc. demonstrated the 
automated recycling truck to show how the system works. The trucks will begin 
picking up recyclable items and garbage around the city on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Glass and plastic containers, aluminum cans, newspapers and other items will be 
collected from green, 110-gallon cans that were distributed to residents 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Other refuse will be stored in similar black cans for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This city has a futuristic look," said Vasquez. "We are facing a critical 
level of crisis in a throwaway society. This is a move which we hope other 
cities will follow." 
</P>
<P>
The automated trucks are operated by one employee instead of two, and a 
mechanical arm is used to lift a can and dump its contents. 
</P>
<P>
Collection days for Brea residents will not change, but the recyclable items 
will be picked up twice a month instead of weekly. JENNIFER MOULTON

Police on Wednesday were investigating an accident in which a motorcyclist was 
fatally hurt in a collision with an auto. A passenger on the motorcycle was 
severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Lane Clarida, 18, of Brea died at 7:41 p.m. Tuesday, about an hour 
after the accident on La Habra Boulevard near Palm Street. Both he and his 
passenger, Darrin Royer, 17, also of Brea, were taken by helicopter to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. Hospital officials said Royer was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as Clarida and Royer, neither of whom was wearing a 
helmet, were traveling on La Habra Boulevard. Their motorcycle collided with a 
car driven by Maria Jessica Jimenez, 21, of La Habra, Police Capt. John Rees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was attempting to make a left-hand turn onto La Habra Boulevard, Rees 
said. Jimenez was taken to a hospital with cuts and scrapes and complaints of 
pain, he said.

anniversary of the county GOP's hiring of uniformed poll guards on Election 
Day. About 150 people gathered for the candlelight vigil outside the Garden 
Grove office of Curt Pringle, the Republican who was narrowly elected to the 
72nd Assembly District seat. Lawsuits alleging intimidation of Latinos are 
pending, but the district attorney's office announced Monday that prosecutors 
will not file charges against 20 individual guards, a decision that "appears to 
be an intentional strategy by the district attorney's office to compromise the

<P>
City leaders will meet with Irvine Co. officials Friday to discuss a new 
proposal for the hotly contested Laguna Laurel housing project. 
</P>
<P>
"The council doesn't want it (the offer) discussed until it's presented to the 
Irvine Co.," Mayor Robert F. Gentry said. "But I think it's extremely 
reasonable, and we're serious." 
</P>
<P>
An Irvine Co. spokeswoman also declined to comment until after Friday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city's proposal will counter a previous Irvine Co. offer to sell 276 acres, 
including the planned golf course portion, of the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel site 
for about $38 million, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
"In return, we'd have to agree to support the remainder of the project," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder includes construction of about 3,000 homes, a number that 
environmentalists say would damage the sensitive Laguna Canyon ecosystem, 
increase traffic, destroy Indian burial sites and produce harmful storm drain 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Council members prepared the counteroffer in a special closed session Tuesday 
night after hearing testimony from angry residents and groups, including 
Village Laguna, Laguna Canyon Property Owners, Laguna Canyon Conservancy and 
Laguna Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the item must be placed on the (City Council) agenda," Gentry said. 
"The people must have some say." 
</P>
<P>
Several residents at the meeting urged rejection of the Irvine Co. proposal, 
saying acceptance would do nothing to mitigate damage to the canyon or the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"We would buy the liability for downstream damage (from the project)," said a 
Laguna Canyon property owner. "It would be a condemnation of downtown." 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the emotional meeting was the playing of a recording which had 
just arrived from singer Jose Feliciano. Against a guitar background, the 
Orange County resident urged community support of a protest march through the 
canyon scheduled for Saturday. LESLIE HERZOG

3 INCUMBENTS LOSE SCHOOL BOARD SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Change is coming to the Orange Unified School District in the form of five new 
school board members, who will be sworn in next month. 
</P>
<P>
Voters Tuesday ousted three incumbents from the scandal-plagued board and 
elected most of the candidates backed by the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to change the philosophy of the board, if nothing else by the 
fact that we do have new members," said Russ Barrios, one of the two trustees 
who was not up for reelection. "I think that it will bring new energy." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people, including the three incumbents, vied for the five seats on the 
board. Two board members are retiring. 
</P>
<P>
The election results, said winning challenger Barry P. Resnick, show that "the 
people are speaking and they're saying if you don't do your job, you won't have 
a job. It's great. It's the democratic way. People can make a difference. No 
longer does the incumbent have a free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Moore, 47, another successful candidate, said, "I think our electorate 
has spoken and is interested in seeing us set a new more positive direction for 
our school district." 
</P>
<P>
Several new members said the first thing they must do is learn to work as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Five out of the seven members are new, and we all need to coordinate our own 
agendas," said winner Lila Beavans, 59. "It's important to have cohesion on the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
The other two winners are John Hurley and Alan E. Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Resnick said the first priority should be a settlement with classified 
employees, whose contract negotiations are at an impasse. New members said they 
also hope to improve the district's bilingual education program, decrease class 
size and improve financial management. 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Stover, president of the Orange Unified Education Assn., said the 
teachers are pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope from this new board is that it will put an end to the politics 
and begin working for education in this district. We are in hopes that this 
board will be able to straighten out the mess that exists here." 
</P>
<P>
The defeated incumbents are Joe J. Cherry, Jane McCracken and Sandy Englander. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry was one of three board members accused by the 1986-87 Orange County 
Grand Jury of "not minding the store" while thousands of dollars in kickback 
contracts were negotiated from the district's headquarters. The other two 
trustees implicated in that scandal did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
But voters opted for a clean sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lewis, chairman of Orange Political Action Committee, said, "We couldn't 
get through to the current board and there were five members up for election, 
so we decided to get a new board." SHANNON SANDS

<P>
HOESTEREY TO RESIGN FROM CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a development that could deadlock the Tustin City Council, Councilman Ronald 
B. Hoesterey announced Wednesday that he will resign. 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey said the Nov. 20 meeting will probably be his last, because he is 
moving from Pepperwood to Orange Park Acres and a house large enough that his 
mother-in-law can live with the family. 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey, Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy and Mayor Pro Tem Richard B. Edgar have 
frequently disagreed with Council Members John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott on 
major issues. They have recently divided on the regulation of news racks and 
the shift of election dates from November to April. 
</P>
<P>
Those issues, plus the possible selection of a new mayor and mayor pro tem, are 
scheduled for consideration at Hoesterey's last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although his family will move next week, Hoesterey said he plans to stay with 
relatives in Tustin to retain his resident status. 
</P>
<P>
Without Hoesterey's vote, key issues could deadlock. "There is a possibility 
for 2-2 votes that could stagnate the operations of the city," he said. "It is 
my sincere hope that that doesn't occur." 
</P>
<P>
The council has 30 days after Hoesterey resigns to appoint a replacement. If 
members cannot agree, they must call an election. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and Edgar said they are disappointed to see the departure of Hoesterey, 
who has served on the council for almost 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's provided very good leadership, and he has a good balance between the 
interests of the business community and the residential community," Kennedy 
said.SHANNON SANDS

CITY TURNS ATTENTION TO REPLACING VOSS 
</P>

<P>
As recall organizers took down campaign signs and savored their victory in 
ousting City Councilman Fred Voss, city officials said Wednesday that they will 
move quickly to name a replacement for the man who was mayor until he solicited 
a prostitute in January. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to removing Voss from office by a 2-to-1 margin, voters Tuesday 
also decided that his replacement will be appointed by the City Council rather 
than chosen by a special election that would have cost $45,000. The council 
could name a successor as soon as Nov. 14, the day election returns are to be 
certified by the county, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Election) Code said the City Council shall appoint at once," said City 
Atty. Alan R. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said Wednesday that it was too soon to speculate about who 
might replace Voss. "I really don't have any idea," said Councilman James E. 
Neal. "The election was just yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Moss, chairman of the recall committee, said that his group has concluded 
its involvement in city politics and will not suggest a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Voters "knew the issues and made their wishes known," Moss said. "I feel sorry 
that Fred Voss' political career had to end in this manner." 
</P>
<P>
Voss did not return calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred is, of course, very disappointed, but he believes in the will of the 
people," said Karen Ackley, treasurer for Say No on Recall for Fred Voss. "That 
one isolated incident did not affect his decision-making process, and we as his 
supporters knew that. We are just sorry that the rest of the community didn't 
get an opportunity to realize that too." 
</P>
<P>
Voss, 52, a telephone systems manager, was arrested by Santa Ana police during 
a well-publicized crackdown on prostitution on Harbor Boulevard in January. 
After offering $20 to an undercover officer disguised as a prostitute, Voss was 
arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex. 
</P>
<P>
He later pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge, was fined $300 and 
sentenced to three years of probation. Voss resigned his ceremonial post as 
mayor but refused to give up his council seat. MARY LOU FULTON and ALLISON

PEOPLE: MAKING MODELS IS A LABOR OF LOVE, AND IT'S HIS LIVELIHOOD 
</P>

CAPISTRANO BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malcolm Wilson was one of those kids who grew up with an X-Acto knife in his 
hand. He was a gifted model-kit maker, one who actually finished the ship, 
airplane and car models he started. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult, Wilson, 33, is just as busy making models, although now they 
eventually become full-size rides in theme parks throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of funny, but I'm using a lot of the techniques I learned as a kid 
when I built models from kits," said the 30-year Capistrano Beach resident who 
works for Theme Design in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently designing and building flying vehicles that resemble antiquated 
aircraft for a Coney Island theme park that will have a turn-of-the-century 
look. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy designing models as much as I like making them," he said. "I favor 
building models that fly, swim or do something." 
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder that Wilson has found happiness in his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I really appreciate what I've got here, and they pay me to do it. What could 
be be better?" said Wilson, who earlier worked 15 years in the graphics field 
before changing careers to build models for theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from work, he is now specializing in building old-time sailboat and ship 
models, many of them powered by modern-day, radio-controlled devices. He 
usually sails them in the harbor at Dana Point or at lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how to sail when I was a kid and I continued to love it," Wilson 
said, "but I don't sit around and make boats all the time," he said. "I like to 
get out there and sail them too. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson builds both model ships and radio-controlled airplanes, which he takes 
to deserted stretches of beach to fly them, another venture that harks back to 
his youth when he would sit in front of a television set and put kit planes 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I go out and fly the planes, it seems about a half-dozen kids will 
show up to take a look and if someone looks confident I give him a shot at the 
controls," said the San Clemente High School graduate and former Saddleback 
College and San Diego State University student. "That's really part of the 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
What was more fun, he recalls, was finding out how to make models from kits. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard part was starting the first ones and finishing them," he said, noting 
that "the more I did the easier they became and the better they looked. The 
easy part is to quit. You just have to get over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has had a happy life making models, Wilson said he plans to build a 
full-size sailboat, "something I can use to get some exercise and get down on 
the water for a relaxing day." 
</P>
<P>
For heavier exercise he surfs, another of his childhood escapades. 
</P>
<P>
However, building models is his mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could live happily without building model boats and 
airplanes," he said. "You just don't spend a good part of your life making 
things and then give it up." 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 11, Pamela Ann Whishaw and Byron R. Hoffman, both of Newport Beach, 
discovered each other in a Laguna Beach art gallery and last Thursday the 
couple married in a private ceremony at the same gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Attending were Whishaw's children, Steve, 24, and Kimberly, and Hoffman's 
children, Karen, 27, and Suzayn, 24. 
</P>
<P>
After a private dinner party, the bride and groom and their four offspring 
boarded a jet plane for a week's "funnymoon," as the children called it, with 
stops in Lake Tahoe, Vancouver, Canada, and Sun Valley, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
The second week, Hoffman, an Irvine land broker, and Whishaw, a marketing 
executive, went alone to Rancho Mirage for what they said would be a honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tom W. Thomson, president of the Orange County Fair, said drivers who show up 
with four or more people in their car at the July 11-22 fair will be allowed to 
park free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage car-pooling as much as possible to the annual Orange 
County Fair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers with less than four passengers in the car will pay the $3 parking fee, 
which is up from $2 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Flynn of Santa Ana will speak Saturday on "The Battle of Gettysburg" during 
the Fifth Annual West Coast Civil War Conference in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Although Flynn has studied the Civil War throughout his life, he will get some 
helpful hints from Steve Madden of La Habra, who will attend the convention and 
who actually fought in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
Madden is one of a host of Orange County residents who fight in Civil War 
re-enactments on weekends at Fort Tejon.

LAGUNA NIGUEL'S NEW LEADERS EXPECT A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO CITYHOOD

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Always the bridesmaid but never the bride, this community has finally made it 
to the altar. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel, which struggled for three years to get the question of cityhood 
on the ballot, on Dec. 1 will become Orange County's 29th city. 
</P>
<P>
It's a big change but one the community is ready for -- and has been carefully 
planning for -- Councilwoman-elect Patricia C. Bates said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She also marveled at the size and scope of Tuesday's election mandate for 
cityhood: "It was overwhelming. We're all still in a state of euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel voters gave a thundering approval of nearly 89% for cityhood 
Tuesday, with a vote of 8,463 to 1,058. The pro-cityhood turnout, she noted, 
surprised even the most optimistic of incorporation boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel becomes a county city with a montage of images: a picturesque, 
planned community of expensive homes dotting undulating hills; a city whose 
Main Street is fast, sleek Crown Valley Parkway; a city whose best-known 
architectural work is the curious Ziggurat -- a federal building that was 
constructed in a style from ancient Babylonia. 
</P>
<P>
This elegant, eclectic community of about 40,000 residents moves from 
unincorporated county to independent city in less than three weeks -- an 
unusually short time span, according to the county Local Agency Formation 
Commission. By contrast, LAFCO noted, Mission Viejo had almost five months to 
make the adjustment, and Dana Point had about six months. 
</P>
<P>
But Bates said Wednesday that Laguna Niguel began preparing for cityhood long 
before Tuesday's climactic vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Laguna Niguel Community Services District board commissioned a management 
consultant team in September to outline the process for transition," Bates 
said. "They are setting up the basics, such as the city's banking and insurance 
-- all the housekeeping functions for a new city." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the new city is also ready to get off to a running start on issues 
facing it. She predicted that city planning and police protection would be 
among the first items under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"Land-use planning and the level of police protection -- I think those will be 
things the new council will focus on," she said. "About 35% of our community 
still remains to be developed, and how that is done is a concern of the 
residents here. The residents also are interested in how much police service we 
will contract for with the Sheriff's Department." 
</P>
<P>
Bates topped a field of 23 council candidates. She outdistanced her nearest 
competitor by about 2,400 votes. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, five people, including Bates, will be sworn in as the inaugural City 
Council. Council members will vote among themselves for mayor. The candidate 
who got the most votes in the popular election usually gets that honor, so 
Bates is likely to be Laguna Niguel's first mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, 49, handles personnel and community relations work for her husband's 
architectural firm, John Bates Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The other four council members elected Tuesday are James F. Krembas, 53, 
principal of San Clemente High School; Paul M. Christiansen, 38, a stockbroker; 
Thomas W. Wilson, 49, a program manager for Rockwell International, and Larry 
A. Porter, 50, an investment broker. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, Krembas, Christiansen and Porter are all directors of the Laguna Niguel 
Community Services District, which until Dec. 1 will continue to oversee parks 
and roads. Bates is also a member of the Laguna Niguel Community Council, as is 
Wilson, the current president of that body. The council has been an advisory 
arm to county government. 
</P>
<P>
"All five of us elected to the new City Council have been working together for 
years," Bates said. "We know each other well, and we know the problems of our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
One problem that has bedeviled Laguna Niguel has been the loss of its coastal 
strip, Monarch Beach. LAFCO placed that 1.5-mile strand, which includes the 
luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel, in the proposed city of Dana Point in 1987; the 
area then voted to incorporate and became a city last Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel residents, furious about the loss, have two legal challenges 
pending in the courts, both seeking to win back Monarch Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The coastal question is an issue very much before the people of Laguna 
Niguel," Bates said. "We're in the courts with two lawsuits on that issue, and 
we'll pursue that. Wherever we went during the campaign, we found that this 
coastal issue is still very much a concern of the residents." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point Mayor Eileen Krause on Wednesday congratulated Laguna Niguel on 
becoming a new city. 
</P>
<P>
She said Dana Point extends cooperation and best wishes, "but Monarch Beach 
remains a part of Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said: "One point I want to make clear. That point is that Monarch Beach 
didn't belong to anyone. It was unincorporated, just as was Dana Point and just 
as was Laguna Niguel. But the residents in Monarch Beach wanted to become a 
part of Dana Point, and they are now a part of our city, and they will continue 
to be a part of our city." 
</P>
<P>
Monarch Beach residents themselves voted in 1987 to go with Dana Point, but 
Laguna Niguel leaders protest that the advisory election was limited to an area 
favoring Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point Councilwoman Judy Curreri added in a separate interview: "Laguna 
Niguel is going to find out that it has many things to do as a city -- a lot 
more things than just trying to wage an old battle."

L. Donald Shields, former president of both Cal State Fullerton and Southern 
Methodist University, has accepted a position as head of the new California 
Council on Science and Technology, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shields had been president of Cal State Fullerton for nine years. At the time 
he was appointed, he was the nation's youngest state university president at 
age 34. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned from SMU citing medical reasons in 1986, as a school football 
scandal was unfolding. After it was revealed that the school's trustees, with 
Gov. Bill Clements as chairman, had approved a play-for-pay scheme for 
athletes, the NCAA imposed its "death penalty" on the school and its football 
program was dropped for two years.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
MEASURE M: TIME TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after a major defeat may not be a good time to talk about starting 
over. But it is never too soon to regroup for another attempt at a measure to 
fund much-needed improvements to the Orange County highway and transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, which would have imposed a half-cent sales tax increase to raise 
$3.1 billion over 20 years for the county's transportation projects, was 
defeated Tuesday, 53% to 47%. Discouraging as that sounds, it lost by less than 
the 2 1/2-1 margin by which a similar traffic measure was trounced in 1984. We 
think of it as a slow coming to grips with the facts: There is no magical pot 
of money out there to take Orange County out of its traffic misery. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with similar traffic problems, voters in San Bernardino, Imperial, Santa 
Barbara and San Francisco counties Tuesday approved half-cent sales tax 
increases for their transportation plans. All the counties contiguous to 
Orange, and a total of 15 in the state, now have approved such taxes. 
</P>
<P>
While not perfect, Measure M was a sound plan that would have speeded the 
widening of the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5), added lanes to the Santa Ana, 
Riverside, Orange, San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, built a network of "super 
streets" and coordinated traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M apparently failed to overcome Orange County's anti-tax mentality or 
alleviate fears that the money would result in more development and even worse 
traffic problems in the future. Many voters were suspicious of the heavy-handed 
backing of developers, who financed the campaign to the tune of $2.5 million. 
And they lacked faith that government would spend the money wisely. 
</P>
<P>
But the process of coming up with a transportation measure must continue, and 
its base must be widened so that the next measure is truly a consensus of all 
those who have an interest in the well-being of the county and its residents. 
It is time for all to realize that nobody is riding to the rescue. The 
prospects of additional funds from state or federal sources are dim, especially 
since Orange County residents, unlike their neighbors, have refused to dig 
deeper to help solve the problem with local funds. 
</P>
<P>
The county must help resolve its own traffic problems or forfeit the right to 
complain.

U.S. HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is time to think more about our greatest national weakness, namely health 
care. We have just had a bitter taste of being taxed on tax to support 
so-called catastrophic health care. The United States has 37 million people who 
are uninsured and 10 million to 12 million of that number are our children. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians tell us we have the best medical facilities in the world, but go on 
to say that only 30% can afford those facilities. The other 70% must go without 
care or go bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come when our businesses and factories can no longer afford health 
insurance for their employees and are ready to make a change. We must realize 
that health is everyone's problem. They say that the United States has the 
highest health care bill of any nation in the world, yet we have a high 
mortality rate for babies up to 1 year of age. 
</P>
<P>
So what is the solution to this dilemma? 
</P>
<P>
Other nations have pioneered this problem and none have given up national 
health care once in place. We know that doctors and insurance companies will 
tell us it won't work, but we have listened to them long enough. Let this 
nation be all it can be.

UNOCAL TO CEASE OPERATIONS AT ITS OIL REFINERY IN TEXAS; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE MOVE IS SEEN AS PART OF THE NEW CHAIRMAN'S PLAN TO STREAMLINE 
MONEY-LOSING OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unocal Corp. said Wednesday that it would cease manufacturing at its Beaumont 
oil refinery in Texas early next year, suspending virtually all operations at 
the unprofitable 65-year-old plant, which employs 462 people. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Unocal admitted that it had failed to turn around the aging plant 
even after eliminating 160 jobs and cutting money-losing production of 
petroleum fuels last summer. Unocal said it has no offers to buy and no plans 
to sell the plant in Nederland, Tex., about 75 miles east of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite efforts to increase profitability at the refinery, the facility has 
continued to lose money every month since the downsizing last year," Richard J. 
Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The company did not detail losses, except to say they amounted to several 
million dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as part of Unocal's continuing effort to streamline 
unprofitable operations under Stegemeier, who succeeded longtime Unocal 
Chairman Fred L. Hartley last year. But some analysts said the closing runs 
counter to a trend in the industry that has kept refined products in strong 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Hartley had opposed efforts to close or cut output 
at Beaumont, giving rise to unfounded rumors that he had his first Unocal job 
at the plant. Hartley first worked for Unocal in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Under Stegemeier, Unocal has systematically sold assets, including its downtown 
Los Angeles headquarters. Last month, the company said it would significantly 
reduce its retail operations in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Unocal discontinued making gasoline and other petroleum fuels at 
the 120,000-barrel-per-day Beaumont plant. The plant could only process costly 
low-sulfur crude oil, and profit margins for refined products were thin in the 
Gulf area, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
By focusing on relatively small production of high value-added specialty 
chemicals and lube oil at the plant, the company had hoped to stem the flow of 
red ink. The plant now processes about 50,000 barrels of crude per day. 
</P>
<P>
The company will begin shutting down operations in mid-January, with all 
manufacturing to stop by the end of the first quarter of 1990. The company may 
continue to operate the plant as a terminal, to accept oil for shipment 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The plant's 462 workers will be transferred to other operations or be 
dismissed. Unocal must negotiate severance terms with labor unions representing 
about 337 of the workers. Only about 10 employees will be needed if the plant 
becomes a terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the Beaumont plant's lack of profits to lackluster 
markets for its products, which include lube oil and two hydrocarbons: 
aromatics and aliphatic solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Aromatics include benzene and xylene, used to make gasoline, and toluene, used 
as an industrial solvent. Aliphatic solvents are chemicals used to make paints, 
dry cleaning fluids and ink. 
</P>
<P>
"The real profits are going to companies with refining and marketing together, 
and Unocal has that on the West Coast," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an 
economist and fellow at the Institute for International Economics in 
Washington. "But orphan refineries like Beaumont must dispose of their products 
on the open market, and that is very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that competition, most refiners have enjoyed strong demand for refined 
products over much of the past year. Earlier, the industry had a slump that 
resulted in the closure of several plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries have run at record rates of capacity for much of the year to meet 
relatively strong demand for fuel. Refining capacity could remain tight if 
there are more accidents such as the explosion that disabled a Phillips 
Petroleum Co. plastics plant in Texas last month. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some companies have reopened previously mothballed refineries and 
others have reportedly shopped around to buy refining companies, particularly 
on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent oil refiner, said 
it had received offers from three multinational suitors for either the entire 
Santa Monica-based company or its Northern California refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal itself is about to close a $500-million joint venture deal with the 
national petroleum company of Venezuela that includes selling a half interest 
in its Chicago oil refinery.

Savings Bonds Sales Up 11%: Sales of U.S. savings bonds totaled $589 million in 
October, an 11% gain over September and 8% more than were sold in the same 
month a year ago, the Treasury Department reported. The October sales raised 
the total of bonds held by the public to $116.2 billion, the highest level ever 
and a one-year increase of 7%, the Treasury said. Bonds currently earn interest 
at a rate of 6.98% when held five years or longer.

Kansas City Wants Late Fees From Braniff: City officials said if Braniff Inc. 
doesn't pay $1.8 million in overdue airport rental and gate fees by Nov. 28, it 
risks losing its gates at Kansas City International Airport. Kansas City will 
file a motion in federal bankruptcy court next week demanding the payment and 
will resist any effort by Braniff to extend the deadline, a city official said. 
Airline officials were unavailable for comment.

SECURITY: IN AN ERA OF HOSTILE TAKEOVERS AND COMPUTER THEFT, BUSINESS LEADERS 
ARE SECURITY CONSCIOUS. SECLUDED MEETING PLACES SUCH AS GRAYLYN CONFERENCE 
CENTER, A LAVISH MANSION WITH GUARDED MEETING ROOMS, ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When candidate George Bush held a fund-raiser here last year, he stayed briefly 
at Graylyn, the second-largest home ever built in the state, an imposing stone 
mansion that now is used as a conference center. 
</P>
<P>
Security-conscious Secret Service agents combed the facility's 49 bedrooms, 10 
meeting rooms and the 55 acres of manicured grounds, making a series of 
modifications that included installation of a set of utilitarian beige curtains 
in the area where the future President was to spend a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the least elegant of Graylyn's furnishings, the Bush curtains still 
stand, a reminder of his visit. They also remind visitors of the increasing 
concern with security -- a concern that transcends government, including 
business executives as well. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of corporate takeovers, theft by computer and high-tech spying, 
business leaders have grown increasingly cautious, according to officials at 
Graylyn, which is owned by Wake Forest University. Therefore, they say, their 
business is booming, drawing meetings that formerly would have been held at a 
big hotel or convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Sklar, manager of conference planning for General Electric in New York, 
said that while she still uses hotels at times, conference centers are superior 
in many instances because "I get dedicated meeting space and don't have to 
substantiate why I need the meeting space at night. It is an automatic at a 
conference center -- when they assign you the room it is yours 24 hours a day, 
which is not the case with hotels." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see strangers walking through our halls," said Jane Rachlin, 
assistant director of the Graylyn Conference Center. "Guests don't have to 
worry about people putting up a glass to hear what they're saying." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the walls of the Norman Revival mansion are two feet thick. So are the 
floors. Room doors are equipped with combination locks, and the center will 
station guards outside rooms on request. A helicopter pad is on the front 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Lynch, director of the High Point Economic Development Commission, has 
hosted meetings at Graylyn and said because of its secluded location away from 
the center city, "you could secure the place a lot easier than a typical 
hotel." 
</P>
<P>
While security may be a pressing concern for many of the hundreds of 
associations, corporations and government groups that meet there annually, the 
sheer lavishness of the place is also a drawing-card. 
</P>
<P>
Graylyn was completed in 1932 by Bowman Gray, a former president of the R. J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. The mansion's size is second only to George Vanderbilt's 
Biltmore House in Asheville. It was donated to Wake Forest in 1947, suffered a 
fire in 1980 and was restored and converted to a conference center, opening in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The center offers high-powered executives the usual amenities such as golf, 
tennis and jogging facilities, but, aiming to pamper and intrigue, it also 
features a Turkish mosque, a 15th Century French carved stone doorway, a tent 
room the Grays brought back from Egypt, art pieces that are rotated every two 
months and an Art Deco swimming pool that resembles an ocean liner pool, 
complete with portholes. Some bathrooms boast gold-plated fixtures, Italian 
marble and showers with 17 showerheads. There are no televisions in the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Gilsenan, general manager and director of the center, seems particularly 
proud of one of the center's culinary features: an "ice cream room" containing 
a tall freezer filled with a fancy brand of ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hearn Jr., president of Wake Forest, said Graylyn gives the university 
"a bond with the city, as the university has preserved one of Winston-Salem's 
historic sites and uses it in a manner which does not detract from its beauty 
or historical significance." 
</P>
<P>
Amid a climate of depersonalization, conference centers like Graylyn appeal 
because of their attention not only to luxury but to individual needs, say many 
business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"At Graylyn you're a name instead of a number," said John Roberts, president of 
Solite Corp. in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, conference center officials have a greater stake in pleasing 
customers than do hotel officials, for whom conferences may be only a small 
part of their daily concerns. 
</P>
<P>
No small part of Graylyn's motivation is the income derived from its operation. 
Officials declined to divulge the cost of its conference packages, asserting 
that the figures might be misinterpreted, confused with the price of a mere 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Fortune 500 corporations that hold board meetings and strategy 
sessions in this western North Carolina city are IBM, Sears Roebuck, 
Westinghouse and AT&amp;T, according to Graylyn. 
</P>
<P>
For many guests, money is not a huge consideration. Indeed, Graylyn literature 
describes them as "organizations which emphasize the quality rather than the 
price of accommodations." 
</P>
<P>
But for some, such as the members of the Gastonia, N.C., city council, price 
matters. Last December council members considered holding a workshop at several 
places, including Graylyn, and found that for 25 people they would have to pay 
about $10,000, compared to $3,550 at Appalachian State University. The council 
members chose a third site, a resort that cost $5,750. 
</P>
<P>
The Gastonia mayor was quoted in the Charlotte Observer as saying: "I'd heard 
several people say Graylyn was a nice place," adding, "I never dreamed it would 
cost so much. I thought since it was operated by Wake Forest it would be around 
the same price as Appalachian." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Graylyn officials say they have no trouble keeping the place 
occupied and are now taking reservations for 1994. And the center is doubling 
its space, converting a group of buildings formerly used for caretaker's 
quarters, garages, stables and poultry houses into an additional 45 guest rooms 
-- with country French decor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're busy all year round," said Gilsenan. "There's more demand than 
facilities." He said Russians, Chinese and Japanese all have booked conferences 
here. "We're getting more international."

<P>
Stocks turned upward Tuesday on evidence that the Federal Reserve was taking 
steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to decline. News 
accounts this morning quoted unidentified government officials as saying that 
inference was correct. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that encouraged stock traders who had been growing increasingly 
apprehensive about the possibility of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters still expect corporate profits, which came in below expectations 
for the third quarter, to be disappointing for the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed could presumably cushion the impact of an economic slowdown in the 
future by relaxing its credit policy now. 
</P>
<P>
A relatively small St. Louis bank lowered its prime lending rate to 10% from 
10.5%, helping to stir expectations that bigger money-center banks might soon 
do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks were notably strong. J. P. Morgan gained 1 7/8 to 43 1/2; 
BankAmerica rose 1 1/4 to 28 5/8; Manufacturers Hanover edged up 1 1/4 to 37, 
and Chemical Banking rose 1 to 32 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chip industrials included Philip Morris, up 3/4 at 41 
5/8; General Electric, up 1 at 54 1/2; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2 5/8 at 129 
1/8; Coca-Cola, up 2 1/4 at 74 1/2, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 
3/4 at 44 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
But International Business Machines dropped 5/8 to 96 3/4 and Digital Equipment 
was down 1 1/2 at 87. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth dropped 1 1/8 to 58 1/4 amid some disappointment about the size of 
the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse Technology led the active list, down 1/8 at 9 3/8. The stock traded as 
high as 12 1/2 early in the session amid takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Then it fell back when the company said it was discussing a possible 
acquisition at $10 a share with a party it didn't identify. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 170.15 million shares, against Tuesday's 163 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded in moderate trading, ending a 
three-session losing streak. The key Nikkei average of 225 shares jumped 325.13 
points to close at 35,595.59. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed sharply higher Wednesday largely on technical factors 
and positive sentiment stemming from Wall Street's continued recovery from its 
steep loss at the start of the week. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 
25.6 points to close at 2,203.6. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bill prices rose as the bond market also reacted favorably to the 
signs that the Fed had eased monetary policy. Prices of longer-term securities 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or under $1 for 
each $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased 
to 7.87% from 7.86% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was little activity in longer-term issues because of 
hesitation in advance of Treasury auctions of 10-year and 30-year securities 
scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Bills did well," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., managing director of Stone &amp; 
McCarthy Research Associates. "Primarily I think it's because it's generally 
acknowledged that the Fed has eased monetary policy, so some of the short-term 
rates responded favorably." 
</P>
<P>
Easier monetary policy and lower interest rates increase the value of 
securities that are already issued and pay higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Traders believe that evidence of credit policy easing came Tuesday, when the 
Fed unexpectedly injected $2 billion of reserves into the market. The sign was 
registered in a drop in the key federal funds rate, the interest on overnight 
loans between banks. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate was quoted at 8.375%, down from 8.50% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-point drop in the federal funds rate this week is the fifth small 
decline that has occurred since late May, when the central bank began to 
reverse a yearlong effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fight 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose modestly against most major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for 
gold at 4 p.m. EST of $387.50 an ounce, up from $384.75 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said the dollar showed fundamental strength despite the 
market's perception that the Fed is relaxing its credit policy, which likely 
would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress 
the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar is basically absorbing the lower interest-rate scenario rather 
well," said Robert Hatcher, a vice president of corporate trading at the New 
York office of Barclays Bank PLC. "It's hanging in there." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that traders are looking toward today's government report on wholesale 
price inflation in October for further signs of an economic slowdown, which 
could spur the Fed to ease credit further. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to a closing 142.97 Japanese yen from 143.63 yen at Tuesday's close. 
Later, in London, it declined further to 142.73 yen. But in trading in New 
York, the dollar recovered and finished at 143.18 yen, up from 142.95 yen late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound rose in London to $1.5860 from $1.5810 late Tuesday. Later, 
in New York, the pound fetched $1.5885, up from $1.5865 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures prices slid on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders 
shrugged off news that petroleum stocks in the United States declined. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybeans and precious metals were mixed, copper 
advanced and livestock and pork futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 to 15 cents lower, with the 
contract for delivery in December at $19.87 a barrel; heating oil was 0.16 cent 
to 1.13 cents lower, with December at 58.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline 
was 0.49 to 0.54 cent lower, with December at 51.87 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The selling was spurred by bearish inventory data from the American Petroleum 
Institute, which showed a 3.98-million-barrel draw on crude stocks to 341 
million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stock drawdown occurred on the West Coast, while stocks actually 
increased in the Midwest and Gulf regions," said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices were higher on New York's Commodity Exchange as 
uncertainty continued about labor activity at Chile's Chuquicamata mine, the 
world's largest open-pit mine. 
</P>
<P>
Copper was 1.5 to 3.9 cents higher, with November at $1.1545 a pound.

The Treasury began to replenish its coffers Wednesday after last-minute 
congressional action raising the debt limit averted the government's first-ever 
default. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury sold $16 billion of new three- and six-month bills at its weekly 
auction, which was postponed Monday because the government's borrowing 
authority had dropped to $2.8 trillion, a level its debt already surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
The drop also forced postponement of $40 billion in quarterly refunding 
auctions; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the government would 
default if Congress failed to act by midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Without congressional action, the Treasury would have been unable to redeem 
$13.8 billion in bills that mature today. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved legislation shortly before the midnight deadline raising the 
debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the fiscal year ending next Sept. 30. 
President Bush signed the bill on Wednesday morning and the Treasury 
rescheduled its auctions, starting with the short-term bill offering that 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury on Wednesday also resumed sales of U.S. savings bonds and special 
securities for state and local governments, the temporary investment vehicles 
for money those governments raise in the bond market, that had been suspended.

ST. LOUIS BANK TRIMS ITS PRIME RATE TO 10%

Trend-setting Southwest Bank of St. Louis on Wednesday reduced its prime 
lending rate to 10% from 10.5%, acting fast after signs this week that the 
Federal Reserve has eased credit to keep the economy from sliding into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Other banks are expected to follow suit, economists said, viewing Southwest 
Bank's move as a logical response to recent behind-the-scenes Fed actions to 
push interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates are heading south," said Southwest Bank Chairman Andrew Baur, 
citing the Fed's guiding hand. 
</P>
<P>
The initial signal that rates were coming down emerged earlier this week with a 
drop in the federal funds rate, the fee banks charge each other for overnight 
loans. The rate is highly sensitive to Fed policy, since the loans are to meet 
Fed cash requirements. 
</P>
<P>
When the rate dropped to 8.5% from 8.75% on Tuesday, helped by Fed injections 
of cash into the banking system, other key rates were expected to follow. The 
closely watched rate fell even further Wednesday, slipping to 8.375%. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed easing was a surprise, however, since it took place amid recently mixed 
economic statistics. But economists agreed that the Fed is hedging its bets to 
prevent a damaging recession. 
</P>
<P>
The prime is traditionally the interest rate a bank charges its best customers, 
but is more commonly used now as a peg for consumer rates. The Federal Reserve 
estimates that half of all home equity loans are tied to the prime. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis regional bank's lower prime takes effect today. It said the move 
"reflects a general easing of interest rates due to a slowdown of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
If others follow Southwest, it would be the first reduction in the prime since 
July, when banks lowered it to 10.5% from 11%. 
</P>
<P>
That move was led by Chase Manhattan Corp., which lowered its prime July 10. 
Other banks followed suit at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
No major banks immediately followed Southwest's lead Wednesday. Spokesmen for 
Citibank, Chase Manhattan and Morgan Guaranty, all of New York, and San 
Francisco-based BankAmerica said they had no immediate announcements on their 
prime rates. 
</P>
<P>
A small New England bank, First Federal Savings Bank of Boston, announced late 
in the day that it had lowered its prime rate to 10%, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But easier credit conditions, banks' lower cost of doing business and a 
competitive banking environment should prompt others to do so soon, economists 
said. Nonetheless, some banks awaited more signs from the Fed, which does not 
announce its policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
"My bottom line is yes, the Fed is in the process of easing or at least sending 
a signal to the market that it does not want (federal) funds to tighten," said 
Joe Plocek, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Bank's prime rate cut had little immediate impact on the credit 
market, where commercial banks' actions are less important than the Fed's 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
However, stocks surged, with the Dow industrials closing up 26.23 to 2,623.36 
in an enthusiastic response to the lower prime.

U.S. TO PRESS 'SHOTGUN MARRIAGES' ON SOME S&amp;LS

<P>
The government will press for mergers between struggling savings and loans and 
stronger competitors to build a smaller but healthier thrift industry, M. Danny 
Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the main thrift industry 
group, Wall said his agency would use the threat of penalties against thrifts 
to arrange "shotgun marriages" with potential suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling this our arranged marriage program. Where I come from, they 
would put the word 'shotgun' in there," he said. He said the program would 
start in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The forced mergers would apply to S&amp;Ls that fall short of tough new capital 
requirements issued by the office this week. 
</P>
<P>
The capital rules and merger programs are the latest steps by the chief federal 
regulator of the 2,900 U.S. thrifts to reform the industry after heavy losses 
forced Congress to pass a $159-billion bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said well-run institutions in the thrift industry, which is a major source 
of loans for home buyers, have been penalized for imprudent and criminal 
actions by some savings executives. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who has been heavily criticized by members of Congress, vowed he will be 
a diligent enforcer of new rules requiring thrifts to put more of their own 
funds at risk in the form of capital. 
</P>
<P>
The capital rules issued by the thrift office Monday will require many thrifts 
to increase their capital beginning next month as a cushion against losses and 
if they cannot, to submit a plan to comply. 
</P>
<P>
If a cash-strapped thrift receives an offer to be acquired but is too coy about 
accepting, the regulators will have to consider whether the thrift's behavior 
violates a rule against operating in an unsafe manner, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will consider enforcement actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said as many as 300 thrifts could disappear into acquiring firms, which 
might be healthy thrifts, commercial banks or industrial companies and will 
include non-U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese firm is acquiring part of a Hawaii thrift for $20 million, Wall 
said, without identifying them. He said Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, the 
largest trust company of Canada, is investing $110 million in Pacific First 
Financial of Seattle in order to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"Major international financial service organizations share our vision of a 
positive future for the thrift industry," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, the agency will soon issue rules that will specify when an 
undercapitalized thrift must limit or omit dividends to help build up capital, 
Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the number of thrifts that are insolvent because they have liabilities 
exceeding assets will continue to grow.

THATCHER BACKS NUCLEAR POWER IN FIGHT AGAINST WARMING

<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday that nations can fight 
the threat of global warming by increasing the use of nuclear power and 
allowing free market forces to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said the "greenhouse effect" caused by carbon dioxide emissions poses 
clear dangers to the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the 
atmosphere," she told General Assembly delegates during a seminar on global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing task which faces us at the international level is to 
negotiate a framework convention on climate change -- a sort of good conduct 
guide for all nations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
More specific agreements to restrict damage to the climate would then be 
negotiated among nations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher reiterated her government's position that more study of global 
warming is needed before remedies are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
She said Britain will establish a Center for the Prediction of Climate Change, 
which will have advanced computing facilities to predict climate changes. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher proposed letting market forces work to solve the problem in developed 
countries and the greater use of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
She said Britain will spend $158 million to help developing nations preserve 
their rain forests.

JURORS SCREENED FOR TRIAL IN 27 BUS CRASH DEATHS

<P>
Amid extraordinary security, jury selection began Wednesday for the trial of a 
man charged with 27 counts of murder in the nation's deadliest accident alleged 
to involve drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mahoney, a 36-year-old Worthville laborer, sat quietly in the sealed 
Carroll County circuit courtroom. He is charged with 82 counts for allegedly 
driving his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 and slamming into a church 
bus loaded with children returning from an outing. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 people who died as a result of the fiery crash on May 14, 1988, all 
but three were children. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the murder counts, there are 42 wanton endangerment charges, 12 
assaults and one charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. Mahoney 
faces life imprisonment on each of the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
One wanton endangerment charge against Mahoney was dropped Monday. Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Paul Richwalsky, who was appointed special prosecutor, said the 
victim did not wish to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Richwalsky said the woman involved was not in the bus from the Radcliff 
Assembly of God church, but was in another car on I-71 the night of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine prospective jurors packed the tiny courtroom Wednesday. Similar 
groups will be interviewed today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone entering the courtroom was searched and had to pass through a metal 
detector. Nearly a dozen State Police officers were at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Charles Satterwhite said the measures were designed to ensure an 
uneventful and fair trial. "We want to do it once and we want to do it right," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective jurors are not using their names but are identifying themselves by 
numbers assigned by the judge. Satterwhite also has taken other extraordinary 
measures to protect the anonymity of potential jurors, even forbidding the news 
media to take their pictures while in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
During the general questioning, prospective jurors were asked if the use of 
alcohol and youthful victims would influence their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence that Mahoney reportedly had nearly 2 1/2 times the legal limit of 
alcohol in his blood the night of the accident will be introduced during the 
trial.

Old Raiders love Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"A fascinating fact is that Art is on the same par with Gen. George Patton and 
John Madden," says Lester Hayes. "His 45-man unit distinctly loves him." 
</P>
<P>
Current Raiders love Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a John Wayne kind of guy in that movie, 'The Quiet Man,' " says 
Howie Long. "I wasn't surprised (by the turnaround). It was the lid being taken 
off the teapot. It was boiling and some steam needed to be let off. The boys 
wanted to run free, man." 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Raiders love Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Art always had a presence," says the 49ers' Matt Millen. "There was something 
about Art, I don't know what it was. Uppy (Gene Upshaw) would talk and some 
guys would choose to listen and some wouldn't. When Art said something, guys 
sat up and took heed." 
</P>
<P>
Part-time Raider franchises love Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here yesterday morning, I noticed there was a big difference in the 
attitude around here, " said Bo Jackson, a day after arrival. "There were a lot 
more smiling faces. People are happier. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some big things are going to happen pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows the future, too? 
</P>
<P>
What's not to love? Art Shell is warm, soft-spoken except after holding calls 
-- and suddenly a sensation. The first black coach in the modern era of the 
National Football League is 4-1 and the only fluke was the loss. If his kicker 
hits two makeable field goals at Philadelphia, he's 5-0 and Ted Koppel is 
trying to do "Nightline" from Shell's living room. 
</P>
<P>
What doesn't seem possible now? Al Davis standing on the victory stand at New 
Orleans, accepting the Lombardi Trophy and telling Paul Tagliabue he's the 
greatest football commissioner since the NFL-AFL merger . . . or Bo pulling his 
groin muscle and Davis pulling out for Sacramento? The difference is there's an 
upside in sight, which the Raiders have created in five weeks under their new 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
If this isn't a dream come true for a rookie mentor, one doesn't exist, but 
Shell measures his joy. 
</P>
<P>
He squirmed when approached for this story. He ducked ABC's "Monday Night 
Football" last week. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaim he cares about comes from his peers and his family, who are almost 
one and the same for him. 
</P>
<P>
His idea of fulfillment would be to win the Super Bowl, have Davis pull him 
aside, look into his eyes and tell him, "Nice job;" then go home, kiss his wife 
and hug his sons. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Jackson called the Raider office the week he was hired but Shell didn't 
mention it for days, and only after being asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
Without prodding, though, he told of his oldest son, Art Jr., a basketball 
player at Palos Verdes High, telling him how proud he was, and how overwhelmed 
he had felt hearing it. 
</P>
<P>
He said he almost cried in the Meadowlands dressing room after his first 
victory, but his players wouldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ride again, or threaten to. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of football could cry, too. 
</P>
<P>
THE HONEYMOONERS 
</P>
<P>
Mike Shanahan is a brilliant guy. The guy -- I mean, when we played Denver, he 
came out on the field and he was rattling off defensive schemes we could run 
against them, just bang-bang-bang-bang. It was a philosophy thing. It's like 
the Japanese in that movie, "Gung Ho," coming in and running that car factory. 
The guys were working their butts off, but they did it their way. They've got 
music on the assembly line. And the new guys come in and say, "No. no, no. This 
is the way we're going to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HOWIE LONG 
</P>
<P>
 Under Tom Flores, it was semi-democratic. Under Coach Shanahan, it was a 
dictatorship. He thought he was Coach Davis' twin brother. It was a mind-set. 
He thought it was his team. Oh, n-o-o-o! There's only one Coach Davis. So be 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LESTER HAYES 
</P>
<P>
If the players were glad to see Shell, who had been a friend as long as they 
had been Raiders, they were doubly so after the brief, tense reign of Mike 
Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to fault Shanahan for everything that happened. He'd been brought in 
to update Raider philosophy and his track record was plain to see. In his first 
post as an offensive coordinator at Florida, he had coached a soft-thrower 
named Wayne Peace to the NCAA record for completion percentage, better than 
70%. This could only have been accomplished by throwing short. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shanahan was from the bitter division rival Denver Broncos and was 
obliged to assume a holdover staff, assuring an awkward transition, at best. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan was his own man, which might have served him well if things had ever 
gotten rolling. He intended to snap the casual Raiders into the businesslike 
posture employed throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the rules: No eating sunflower seeds in the locker room; a seat for 
everyone and everyone in his seat at meetings; and most sacrilegious of all, no 
sitting on helmets at practices. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how tired a Raider could get standing around for two hours? 
</P>
<P>
Raiders were paid to strike terror in opponents' hearts Sundays, not stand at 
attention Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
"We had assigned seating in the meetings," Long says, laughing. "I didn't do 
well with assigned seating at St. Francis de Sales Junior High and I wasn't 
doing very well here with it." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
Davis talked later of having wanted "that freshness" from the outside -- 
outsiders had been the only ones really considered to replace Flores -- but 
once it was on the lot, Davis found it more coup than update. He made his 
doubts known throughout the league and by midseason, Shanahan was on the 
griddle. 
</P>
<P>
By the start of this season, after the assistant coach scandal during which one 
of Shanahan's guys, Nick Nicolau, told one of the holdovers, Shell, that he 
wasn't wanted and should take a hike, Shanahan was dangling. 
</P>
<P>
When the Raiders went 0-4 in the exhibition season, he was on borrowed time. 
</P>
<P>
After the Raiders won their opener, Shanahan said their "backs were against the 
wall," which was true enough, in his case. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made a mistake in practice, we would run the play over and over and 
over," Mike Haynes says. "Instead of just saying, 'This is what you did wrong, 
next time do this.' Art's a little more relaxed about it. You're going to make 
mistakes, but when you made a mistake, Mike would blow up. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to know he was feeling the pressure. He did a good job of keeping it 
away from us. He never talked about his job being in jeopardy. But everybody 
knew it was. There was just a lot of tension when the pressure would get to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
After four weeks and three losses, Davis canned Shanahan. Davis had never fired 
a coach and has since said privately that a 20-game stint might not have been 
fair, but that he had concluded they would never have a meeting of minds. 
</P>
<P>
He might also have been looking to launch Shell as well as he could. Winnable 
games against the Jets and Chiefs were next, before the schedule turned tiger. 
</P>
<P>
Under Shell, they won those games. Then the Raiders turned tiger, instead. 
</P>
<P>
HIS OLD RAIDER HOME 
</P>
<P>
In legend, the Raiders present a bristly, porcupine's ball of quills to the 
outside, but to a true insider, they're like an old sofa, all warm and furry 
and soft. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders have only each other to fall back on, so they support each other. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders are family. 
</P>
<P>
Once in, never out. A Raider official remembers Davis talking on the telephone 
to retired lineman Steve Sylvester who was now in business in Cincinnati. Davis 
needed a lineman. Sylvester explained he was now in business. 
</P>
<P>
To which Davis replied: "But what about the Raid-uhs?" 
</P>
<P>
And there were few Raiders like Shell. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 23 years since a little-known No. 3 pick from Maryland State first 
flew west. It was Shell's second time on an airplane. He remembers looking 
forward to this opportunity but missing his family back in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
He was an ambitious young man, but so much had always been closed off. Southern 
schools didn't recruit blacks. His state had just had its first football 
all-star game for blacks; an integrated game wouldn't come till later. 
</P>
<P>
If a faraway Big Ten school didn't happen on you, you went to a black school. 
The kids all repeated stories about the lucky ones, like George Webster, of 
Union, S.C., who went to Michigan State, like litanies. 
</P>
<P>
But you couldn't depend on luck, could you? 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote (Ohio State Coach) Woody Hayes," Shell said, smiling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I typed Woody Hayes a letter -- took typing my senior year. Never sent the 
letter. I had it in an envelope. I don't know what would have happened if I'd 
sent the letter." 
</P>
<P>
He went to Maryland State and became a premium draft pick, although he hadn't 
been invited to an all-star game. He'd seen those major college guys on TV, he 
was good enough to play with them, he thought. Davis saw him on film and 
figured he could. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I graduated, I hopped a plane and came out here (to Oakland)," 
Shell said. "I was out here before training camp, just working, trying to learn 
the techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was surrounded by people. I stayed at a hotel and players stopped by and 
called to make sure I was comfortable. That was a big relief." 
</P>
<P>
He could play with major college guys, all right: 15 seasons, eight Pro Bowls, 
two Super Bowl victories and the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 300-pounder with the footwork of a ballerina, the power of a 
locomotive . . . and the same, sheepish smile he smiles today. 
</P>
<P>
"Art would kill you with kindness," says Lyle Alzado, his longtime Bronco 
opponent and a man who was trying to kill you, for real, on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we played, he smiled and said, 'How you doing, Lyle?' I 
thought, 'What the hell is this?' 
</P>
<P>
"He proceeded to drive me off the ground, drop me on my back and run over me. 
</P>
<P>
"Art was impossible to rattle. I'd talk about his mother, his sister and 
brothers. He ignored me. I hated Art Shell." 
</P>
<P>
What would Shell be thinking, looking across the line at the rising tide of 
Alzado's rage? 
</P>
<P>
"Never let an opponent know he's getting to you," Shell said, smiling like a 
Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
His quiet demeanor hid a burning desire. Before the 1980 AFC championship game 
at San Diego, he made an impromptu speech teammates still remember. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little like the E.F. Hutton commercial," Todd Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Art said, 'If you have to fight, if you have to hold, if you have to grab, 
pinch, punch -- do what it takes!' Even grizzled vets like Ted Hendricks were 
standing there with their jaws open, paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure enough, we went out and beat a team that quite frankly was better than 
us. And you know the rest." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders beat the Philadelphia Eagles -- in New Orleans -- and became the 
first wild-card team to win a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
COACH SHELL 
</P>
<P>
As a Raider star, Shell was the first to extend himself to young players, to 
offer to teach them techniques. Madden noticed and suggested he think about 
becoming an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said that "kinda put a bug in my ear." 
</P>
<P>
After Shell became an assistant, Madden suggested he might even become a head 
coach in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Shell thought his bug was delusionary. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'John, are you dreaming?' " Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
"A head coach in this league? I could see myself a head coach in a college 
someplace but not in this league at that particular time." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of Flores' tenure in 1987, Shell was known to be Davis' top prospect 
on the staff, but Davis was going outside. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the '88 season, there were regrets all around. The staff was 
split with dissension. Shell calls it his lowest time as a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
On the sideline of the finale, as the Raiders lost to Seattle, blowing their 
chance to be an 8-8 playoff team, he and Nicolau argued. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Nicolau asked the why-are-you-sticking-around question. 
</P>
<P>
Davis promptly fired Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing on the sidelines, I thought we didn't have the players on the field 
to win with," Shell says. "I just made a statement to (Nicolau), why isn't a 
certain individual in the game, we're trying to win the doggone thing. I guess 
he took exception to that. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened later on, he came and made the statement to me and another 
coach: 'Why don't you guys leave? Mike doesn't want you here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those days are over, never to be forgotten or lamented in Raiderdom. Now Shell 
tells old Raider stories to rapt new Raiders, who long to reignite the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Shell likens Eddie Anderson's hit on Christian Okoye to Jack Tatum, the defense 
to the Eleven Angry Men of the '60s and says Bob Golic is a "throwback who 
would have fit in with us a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear Ben Davidson's motorcycle warming up in the background. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, hard-nosed salvation of the Raider Way smiles his smiles and 
dreams his dreams.

MAGIC GETS $3,000 FINE FOR FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: NBA DECIDES OPEN-HANDED SLAP BY JOHNSON WARRANTS HEAVIER PENALTY THAN 
ACTIONS OF PHOENIX'S KEVIN JOHNSON, WHO IS HIT FOR $1,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although Magic Johnson maintains that he and guard Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix 
Suns merely engaged in a relatively harmless shoving match that should not even 
have warranted ejections, the Laker star was fined $3,000 by the NBA on 
Wednesday for his part in Tuesday night's altercation. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson, on the receiving end of Magic's repeated pushes 3 minutes 22 
seconds into the Lakers' home opener, was fined $1,000 for fighting. Laker 
guard Byron Scott, the first player to intervene, was fined $500 for pushing 
Kevin Johnson away from Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson got the stiffest penalty because, as a league spokesman worded 
it, he hit Kevin Johnson in the face with an open hand. Johnson said after 
Tuesday's game and again Wednesday that he had not struck Kevin Johnson, that 
he had pushed him, and should not be fined more than his combatant. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the Lakers' practice on Wednesday, before the fines 
were announced, that he would probably appeal any fine for "punching" the Suns' 
guard, who gives away seven inches and 32 pounds to the Lakers' guard. Magic 
could not be reached after the fines were imposed, but he reportedly told Laker 
spokesman Josh Rosenfeld that he "didn't have any problem" with the league's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what (the fine) is going to be, but I'll pay it," Johnson had 
said earlier Wednesday. "But I don't want to pay a punching fine, because I 
didn't hit him. If it comes to that, I will (appeal)." 
</P>
<P>
TV replays showed that Magic Johnson did not use a clenched fist, but shoved 
Kevin backward with a left-hand push to the chest, followed by a right-hand 
push that struck Kevin's left jaw. Bill Oakes, the lead official in Tuesday's 
game, called a "punching" foul on Magic Johnson, apparently as a result of the 
open-handed blow. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the incident was sent to the league office in New York Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Had the league agreed with Magic Johnson, the amount of the fine would have 
been reduced. Last week, Atlanta Hawk forward Kevin Willis was fined $1,500 and 
Indiana center Rik Smits $750 for what the league termed a "fighting incident." 
</P>
<P>
Oakes had told a pool reporter that Magic Johnson's ejection was automatic 
because of the punching foul call. Kevin Johnson's ejection was at the 
official's discretion, Oakes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen (the videotape), and, no, I didn't punch him," Magic Johnson said. 
"I told you guys that Tuesday night, but you still (reported) it as a punch. He 
came running in and, when I pushed him back, you saw (Kevin Johnson's) head go 
back. Maybe that's what you and the refs thought was a punch. You guys saw it 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, he was this close to me (about six inches), and I could have punched 
him if I wanted to. But I didn't. I just pushed him out of my way." 
</P>
<P>
Cotton Fitzsimmons, the Suns' coach, questioned the decision to eject Kevin 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"The officials are on edge this year," Fitzsimmons said. "They've been told to 
crack down on the fighting. If either player had thrown a punch, (that player) 
has to go. They did call Magic for that (punching) foul, but Kevin did nothing 
but push him. There was pushing and shoving all night." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's incident was the fourth altercation in the NBA since the start 
of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Willis-Smits fight, Detroit's James Edwards was fined $2,500 for 
starting a fight with Philadelphia's Mike Gminski during the exhibition season. 
Isiah Thomas of Detroit was fined $1,500 for grabbing Gminski's throat from 
behind. Thomas, in another incident, was fined $1,000 for responding to an 
elbow from Phoenix's Armon Gilliam with a slap to the face. 
</P>
<P>
But Magic Johnson's fine was the biggest this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, asked whether a stiff fine would hurt Johnson's cash flow, laughed 
and said: "That's just chump change to Earvin." 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday night's game, Kevin Johnson said he immediately regretted the 
incident. "It is embarrassing to me," Kevin Johnson said. "I'm surprised I got 
ejected from the ballgame. I pride myself on my conduct. I try to be a role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson said Wednesday that he wanted to put the incident behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come right down to it, I'm really sorry it happened," he said. "I'm 
sorry because I respect and know (Kevin). When you play against one another and 
it's a rivalry like we have, you got to make a stand. I guess that's what we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jawann Oldham, a 7-foot center recently released by the Sacramento Kings, was 
scheduled to have a physical Wednesday, the first step in the club's attempt to 
sign him. Oldham, 32, missed all last season after undergoing major 
reconstructive surgery on his left knee on March 22, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If Oldham passes his physical and decides to sign with the Lakers rather than 
the Seattle SuperSonics, who also are vying for him, he figures to play only a 
supporting role, at least at first. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said we're looking for a big body," Coach Pat Riley said. 
"Someone who can fill a specific role -- block shots, rebound, play tough 
defense. We aren't looking for him as a scorer. He won't be part of our 
rotation right away. He'll have to prove himself. That's if we sign him. But if 
he could help us if he is over his physical problems."

Hurray!

Bartender, drinks all around! No, better yet, let's all bow in silent prayer. A

"Statement on gambling by Pete Rose -- 11/8/89. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was suspended from baseball on Aug. 24, I decided to see a 
psychiatrist because of the many accusations made in recent months that I have 
a gambling problem. Since then, I have come to learn and accept the fact that I 
do have a problem related to gambling -- what my doctor, James Randolph Hillard 
of the University of Cincinnati Medical School, calls a gambling disorder -- 
and I am getting treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Well, hallelujah! The most prolific hitter in the annals of baseball just made 
the most important contact of his career. How's this for a sentence that his 
many friends and fans have been hoping to hear for two years? 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can't gamble on anything anymore, because I can't control it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, amen. Way to go, Pete. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Edward Rose handed that statement to me Wednesday as I walked into his 
hotel room in Beverly Hills. I wanted to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
I had gone there to talk about his recently published book, "Pete Rose: My 
Story," by Pete Rose and Roger Kahn. But I was uneasy. The book was an 
inconclusive rehash of events leading up to the most shocking banishment in 
baseball history since the Black Sox. The book left unanswered questions 
hanging in the air. 
</P>
<P>
The book left Pete Rose in the same unregenerate and unrepentant posture he had 
been in all along. 
</P>
<P>
So, he had bet on a few horses? Big deal. Doesn't everybody? 
</P>
<P>
Was he broke? Are you kidding? Count the Rolls-Royces and the swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
So why was he selling his mementoes? Well, Reggie Jackson sold $980,000 worth, 
a record. Pete sold over a million. Pete is in the business of breaking 
records. He wanted the record, not the money. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsive gambler? Naw! How can you say that about a guy who played in 
Philadelphia and only went to Atlantic City three times? Or was it four? So he 
lost $34,000 in three months. But he was making $400,000, wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
The book was about 290 pages of what the psychologists call denial. 
</P>
<P>
Pete was all right? He was out of the game he loved. He was a nonperson in 
baseball. When he went 'round to the Cincinnati clubhouse the last day of the 
season to say goodby to the team he had led most of the season, he was barred 
from entering. 
</P>
<P>
That's when it finally seeped through to Charlie Hustle that something was 
wrong. He was taking too many pitches. He was getting called out with the bat 
on his shoulder. He had given up the game he loved for the company of felons, 
guys who ratted on him when the cops came. 
</P>
<P>
The world at large pretty much accepted it as an admission of guilt when Pete 
signed an agreement with the commissioner of baseball accepting permanent 
suspension for betting with bookies, associating with felons. And even though 
it specifically stipulated there were no findings about betting on baseball, 
the late Commissioner Bart Giamatti said it was his opinion that Pete had. 
</P>
<P>
Why would Pete capitulate if he had cards to play? Had a deal been cut? Pete -- 
and Giamatti -- said no. Only a right to apply for reinstatement in one year 
instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
But what Pete really couldn't come to grips with was, how could he be diagnosed 
as a compulsive gambler when there were some days he didn't bet at all? It was 
explained to him that alcoholics have been known to stay on the wagon for a 
year. But they are still alcoholics -- as one drink could immediately prove. 
</P>
<P>
Pete conceded that there were forces at work he didn't fully understand. A 
curve on the fists Pete can handle. A psychosis you can't hit to right. 
</P>
<P>
Pete had 15 sessions with his psychiatrist. He learned something about himself 
at each one. Pete is an explosion of energy. When he quit the game on the 
field, there was no place for this to go. 
</P>
<P>
He has to get involved. Other people could watch a horse race, a game, a fight 
on TV. Pete had to get in it. Since he couldn't pick up a bat or a glove and 
get in a game anymore, he took out a checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't there any of this in the book? 
</P>
<P>
"We finished the book on Sept. 1," explains Pete. "Then, I started to go to 
Randy (Hillard). We will update the book." 
</P>
<P>
He will also update Pete Rose. You'll have to hide the cards and soft-pedal the 
spread around Pete, but he's already excited about the challenge of not 
gambling. For Pete, it's just another 3-2 count. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a challenge and this is a challenge," he says, excited. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who ever rooted for Pete Rose with the bases loaded and the game or 
the pennant on the line has to be standing and cheering here. There is one 
thing good to remember: Pete always was at his best with two strikes on him.

GLORY, ACHIEVEMENT ALL IN LINE OF DUTY FOR TITANS' REDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reggie Redding is barely 21, but he already has made peace with his lot in 
life, or at least in football, which is pretty much his life right now. 
</P>
<P>
Behind every great running back, there are the guys in front of him. Redding is 
one of the offensive linemen toiling for the glory of Mike Pringle, the Cal 
State Fullerton running back who tied the national single-game rushing record 
Saturday but didn't find out about it until Monday, when a five-yard 
statistical error was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive linemen are players with no statistics of their own, so they must 
take pride in the accomplishments of others. "It's all right," says Redding, a 
smile breaking across his face. "We're unselfish people." 
</P>
<P>
As Gene Upshaw, executive director of the National Football League Players 
Assn., once said, everyone remembers what a nice job Paul Revere did, but 
nobody ever mentions the horse. Offensive linemen know how the horse feels. 
</P>
<P>
"What (Pringle) is accomplishing, it's our accomplishment, too," said Redding, 
the Titans' 6-foot-4, 270-pound left tackle. "He told us that after the game. 
He gave us all a big hug Saturday. Mike's a great back and a good person. Just 
to do that for him makes us feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's offensive line is not the secret in front of Pringle's success, 
though. Pringle has proven capable of succeeding not only because of his line 
but, at times, in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game this season, Fullerton started only two players on the 
offensive line who had played in a Division I game -- Redding and center Marc 
Hauser. Pringle rushed 10 times, and he was stuffed on play after play. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was so taken aback by the lack of success that it used only 15 
running plays, passing 50 times. Pringle finished with 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Eyes turned to the offensive line. "We weren't ready," said Redding, a senior 
who is a pro prospect. "It took us two or three games to get the offense 
clicking." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the line was one focal point for blame. 
</P>
<P>
"If the running game isn't going or if (quarterback Dan) Speltz is getting 
sacked, people look at the offensive line," Redding said. "But if the guys are 
catching the ball or running the ball, they don't look at us." 
</P>
<P>
In recent games, the line has been playing its best of the season, Redding 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Titan assistant coach Don Morel agrees, especially about Redding's performance. 
"He's always been our best offensive lineman," Morel said. "He was always 
playing well. Now he's dominating." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's line has had more to struggle with than inexperience. It is also 
dangerously thin on backups. Redding had missed only one snap all season before 
Saturday, when he, like Pringle, sat out the final five plays of a 45-10 
victory over New Mexico State. Tom Gang, the right tackle, hasn't missed a play 
yet. Laita Leatutufu, a 6-2, 300-pound right guard, and Hauser, the center, 
have missed fewer than a dozen plays. The only players to get any substantial 
amount of rest are Mike Rogan and Shannon Illingworth, who have been battling 
for the left guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
To Redding, this is just another reason for the line to take pride in the 
accomplishments of Pringle, who is leading the nation in all-purpose running 
and whose 148.9-yard rushing average is second only to that of Florida's Emmitt 
Smith (151.8). 
</P>
<P>
"That's one thing I love about Mike making all that yardage," Redding said. 
"Emmitt Smith, he has 10 or 15 linemen. (Indiana's) Anthony Thompson, (Air 
Force's) Dee Dowis, they have all these linemen and most of them have been 
there five years. We've got five guys getting Mike that type of yardage. This 
1,300 yards is our reward." 
</P>
<P>
A more personal reward for Redding could come in the next National Football 
League draft. His speed, along with his size and strength, has drawn NFL scouts 
for a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
His running ability was in evidence even before the game began at Fresno State 
last month. During individual pregame introductions, most of the offensive 
linemen plodded to midfield, or finished the jog winded. Redding sprinted the 
50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In games, his speed is most apparent when he finishes his assignment and then, 
amazingly, runs downfield with Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that," Redding said. "It's a mismatch, me and those (defensive backs)." 
</P>
<P>
Last season in a victory over San Jose State, Pringle caught a swing pass 
around midfield and headed for the sideline, Redding alongside him, his 
personal blocker. It turned into a 40-yard gain before Pringle was tackled at 
the 10-yard line. Pictures of that run, with Redding in front of Pringle with 
the San Jose State secondary in pursuit, keep turning up in Fullerton 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from his ability on the field, what endears Redding most to his coaches 
is his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at Fullerton in 1988 after transferring from Laney College in 
Oakland, Redding weighed 320 pounds. Fullerton coaches told him he had to get 
down to 300. It meant passing up his beloved red meat in favor of fish and 
chicken and lots of fruit, but Redding did it. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows his dedication," Morel said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had intended to redshirt Redding last season, but with injuries and 
lack of depth, he was forced to play. And he started every game. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they asked him to come to camp at 290. He arrived weighing 289. 
</P>
<P>
"He's this happy-go-lucky guy, but he can turn on the intensity," Morel said. 
"When he's intense, he's intense as anyone you've ever seen. But you'd never 
know that if you run into him in the library or a restaurant."

UTAH VOTERS PASS REFERENDUM FOR OLYMPIC FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A clear majority of Utah voters are willing to spend $56 million to build 
sports facilities in anticipation of the Winter Olympics coming to Salt Lake 
City by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide referendum Tuesday, a proposal to divert 1/32 of revenues from 
the state sales tax over the next 10 years to construct bobsled and luge runs, 
a speed-skating oval and a ski jump passed with 57% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
With 99% of the precincts reporting, the count was 211,385 for the measure and 
161,736 opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-election polls had indicated that the measure would pass with 62% to 
66% of the vote, but an opposition group, Utahans for Responsible Public 
Spending, apparently struck a nerve with some voters. There was a higher 
turnout than expected for an off-year election. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Salt Lake Winter Games Organizing Committee officials called the victory 
decisive. Their chairman, Tom Welch, met Wednesday in Mexico City with Juan 
Antonio Samaranch, International Olympic Committee president, to inform him of 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
Welch had said that Salt Lake City would withdraw its candidacy if the measure 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a landslide from my perspective," said Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter, 
who was elected in 1988 with only 40% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City is among seven cities bidding for the 1998 Winter Games. But 
officials from the organizing committee admit that Nagano, Japan, is the clear 
favorite among IOC members, who will select a site in 1991. Consequently, the 
committee has begun diverting a portion of its resources toward a bid for the 
Games in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee designated Salt Lake City as its candidate for 1998 
and 2002 earlier this year with a stipulation that the city begin building 
facilities in December, 1990, that will be available for use by U.S. athletes 
by June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The vote Tuesday provided financing for those projects and also established a 
Utah Sports Authority to supervise them.

AQUINO DRAWS SIX YEARS FOR DEATHS IN AUTO CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former world champion boxer Lupe Aquino was sentenced Wednesday to six years in 
state prison for vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, who had pleaded no contest to the charge Sept. 8, was driving under the 
influence of alcohol when his car plunged off the San Diego Freeway and down a 
30-foot embankment on Aug. 14, 1988. The crash killed passengers Howard Thomas 
and Teresa Bello of Ventura. Aquino and his girlfriend, Michelle Avila, 
suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David Perez of Los Angeles Superior Court said in Santa Monica that the 
deaths of Thomas and Bello were "clearly attributable" to Aquino. The maximum 
sentence would have been eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, 26, was the World Boxing Council's super-welterweight champion for 
three months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Thomas, Howard Thomas' mother, said she was not satisfied with Perez's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Six years is not enough time for two lives," she said. "Eight years wasn't 
even enough. Two lives -- aren't they worth more than three years? I pray that 
he stays in there the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who said Aquino will be eligible for parole in three years, denied a 
request for bail by Ed Whipple, Aquino's attorney, saying: "Aquino does pose a 
threat to the community because of his repeated acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, originally from Santa Paula but now living in Campo in San Diego 
County, has been charged twice with battery by Avila, who was not present at 
the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Whipple argued that Aquino would have been "an excellent candidate for 
probation because of his support group, which includes his boxing trainers and 
family. He also argued that with a long prison stay Aquino would be too old to 
box, which Whipple said "is the only thing he is qualified to do." 
</P>
<P>
But District Attorney Thomas Miller said Aquino's past made him a poor 
candidate for probation. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that Aquino was driving without insurance at the time of the 
accident. He also mentioned that Aquino had spent 10 days in jail for driving 
without a license, which was revoked after the accident, and that Aquino had 
spent 30 days in jail for failing to pay child support to Avila for the son 
they had together.

WARRIORS' LISTER MAY MISS SEASON AFTER SURGERY ON ACHILLES' TENDON

Golden State Warrior center Alton Lister, who had appeared in 167 consecutive 
NBA regular-season games, is expected to miss the remainder of the season with 
a ruptured right Achilles' tendon, the Warriors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot center was injured Tuesday night in the third quarter of a 118-94 
victory over the Clippers. The injury necessitated surgery Wednesday at Eden 
Hospital in nearby Castro Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lister, 31, acquired from Seattle in the off-season for a first-round draft 
pick, had missed only 13 games in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like somebody kicked me and I fell down," Lister said Wednesday. "When 
I tried to get up and walk, I knew something was wrong. I have never been 
injured before so that's what will make the recovery process so tough. But 
fortunately I have almost a year to get this healed and that's encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
The injury leaves 7-1 Uwe Blab and 7-7 Manute Bol as the Warriors' only big 
men. Injured Jim Petersen, 6-10, is still recovering from Sept. 18 knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Coach and General Manager Don Nelson said the team will be picking up another 
big player to replace Lister "as soon as we can. . . . We're in the process of 
doing that already."

USC FOOTBALL WATCH: AN INSIDE LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening blast: Looks as if they still haven't forgiven USC Coach Larry Smith 
for deserting Arizona three years ago after seven seasons as head man of the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote columnist Greg Hansen of Smith in Wednesday's Arizona Daily Star: "The 
two flaws in his 1986 move were (1) that he created a caste system within the 
Pac-10 by jilting a middle-class program to join the rich and famous, and (2) 
that he didn't so much as say it had been fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a most sterile departure for a man given to tearful locker-room 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries: Arizona redshirt freshman quarterback George Malauulu, the Pac-10 
leader in passing efficiency at 172, is out for the season after tearing knee 
ligaments last week against Cal. Junior Ron Veal will start Saturday against 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
Also out for the year is Wildcat free safety Jeff Hammerschmidt, who tore knee 
ligaments two weeks ago against Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Honors: The list of candidates for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the defensive 
back deemed the nation's best, has been narrowed to 10 finalists, among them 
USC's Mark Carrier and Notre Dame's Todd Lyght. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers: In last year's Arizona-USC game, the Wildcats had the ball for only 18 
minutes 3 seconds, yet managed to rush for 241 yards against the Trojans. 
Arizona still lost, 38-15. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Wildcats are averaging 245.2 rushing yards a game and lead the 
Pac-10. STEVE SPRINGER

ORANGE TRYING TO COMPLETE TURNAROUND

<P>
Long after the conclusion of Orange High School's season opener, Coach Tom 
Meiss went back into the locker room for one last look around. 
</P>
<P>
What he found was one Panther player, sitting in front of his locker. The kid 
was smiling, obviously happy about the 30-0 victory over Chino. 
</P>
<P>
"He just looked up at me and said, 'This stuff can work. We really can win,' " 
Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Panthers have continued to win, reaching new heights under Meiss, who 
is in his first year as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
With one regular-season game remaining, the Panthers are 7-1-1 and have 
clinched a spot in the Southern Section Division VIII playoffs. Their only loss 
was to Estancia, the No. 2 team in the Division VI poll. 
</P>
<P>
It's the most victories for the Panthers since 1986, when they were 7-5 and a 
Pacific Coast League co-champion. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 tonight, the Panthers (4-0 in league) will attempt to win another 
championship when they meet Trabuco Hills at Mission Viejo High School. A 
victory against the Mustangs (8-1, 4-0) will give Orange its second title in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
This from a school that went 14 years between championships. The Panthers 
hadn't even qualified for the Southern Section playoffs since 1972, when they 
won the Crestview League title. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of this rejuvenation is Meiss, who was the head coach at Santa Ana 
for six years from 1978-83. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McMahon, who guided the Panthers to their first league title in 14 years, 
resigned as coach last spring. Finding a replacement proved to be difficult for 
Orange officials. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the league championship, the Panthers had slipped. They had a 4-6 
record in 1987 and were 2-8 in 1988. Orange won only two league games in those 
two years, one of which was a forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
No one on campus wanted the job, so officials went outside the district and 
hired Meiss as a walk-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss has a history of reviving programs. In 1978, he took over a Santa Ana 
program that had won two games in three years. His teams went on to win two 
league titles and compile a 46-23-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of coaches say you can't win without the horses, and there were some who 
told me Orange kids didn't know how to win," Meiss said. "Well, not to sound 
egotistical, but coaching is 75% of it. I'm not saying that it will win every 
game, but good coaching makes a team competitive every week." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Meiss assembled a coaching staff that, although 
inexperienced, was capable of teaching kids to win. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of his assistant coaches, Ed Howard, teaches at the school. Howard, 
who is also the Panther baseball coach, had no experience as a varsity 
assistant. The rest of the staff members are walk-ons, all of whom have close 
ties to Meiss. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bland, Dan Stroup and Cary Conway all played for Meiss at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Haley Jr. is another assistant, whose father was an assistant under Meiss 
at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of experience on the staff. In fact, sometimes I've 
actually been teaching coaches how to coach," Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss has built on the success started by McMahon. He has instilled a winning 
attitude, something he said was lacking when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
He has used toughness and humor to turn the Orange program around. 
</P>
<P>
During Hell Week, the Panthers went through three-a-day practices instead of 
the standard two-a-days. Meiss also has the team in pads every practice, and 
every scrimmage is full contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids don't know what it's like to hit and then giggle," Meiss said. "We're 
at full speed every practice." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Meiss has also kept the team loose. Before each practice, he gathers the 
players together for the Joke of the Day. There are also special events, like 
Crazy Hat Night, when the players come to practice in hats of their own design. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be serious all the time," Meiss said. "You have to be able to laugh 
at yourself from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
But this season, no one is laughing at the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (3-6, 1-2) vs. Mater Dei (5-4, 2-1) at Santa Ana Stadium -- A Mater Dei 
victory will assure the Monarchs of being the Angelus League's No. 2 team 
entering the Division I playoffs. Mater Dei is currently tied with St. Paul for 
second place, but defeated the Swordsmen, 34-24, this season. Servite will be 
out of the playoffs for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Century League -- Foothill at El Modena; Empire League -- Cypress vs. Katella

WATER POLO: TOGETHERNESS AND EXPERIENCE HAVE HELPED THE SENTINELS POST A 
SCHOOL-BEST RECORD THIS SEASON.

<P>
Four all-league seniors and lots of team unity have led Magnolia High School's 
water polo team to its best league record in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia, which faces Don Lugo today in the first round of the Southern Section 
2-A playoffs, finished the regular season 20-6 overall, 10-0 in the Orange 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past couple of years, I've had teams where it was all I could do to 
keep them from getting into fights in practices," Magnolia Coach Grafton Weiss 
said. "But these players work well together." 
</P>
<P>
The four all-leaguers are co-captains Jesse LaVere, Mike Courchaine, Darin 
Schow and Pete Shilaimon. 
</P>
<P>
LaVere, 5-feet-8 and 130 pounds, has set Magnolia records for single-season 
goals (125) and career goals (211). 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, LaVere wanted to play football. But at the time he was 5-4 and 
100 pounds, and his chances of making the team were slim. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman year, I almost drowned," he said. "I could hardly swim." 
</P>
<P>
LaVere, who was named the Orange League's most valuable player this season, 
concurs with his coach when it comes to the reason for the Sentinels' success. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we're doing as well as we are is that in the past, we had a lot of 
conflicting attitudes," he said. "But now, no one cares who scores. I'll pass 
the ball to anyone if they have a better shot than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Courchaine, Magnolia's two-meter man, has been feeding his teammates a 
multitude of passes -- enough, in fact, to set school assist records for a game 
(11) and career (104). 
</P>
<P>
"I feel close to Jesse, because this is our third year on varsity, so I tend to 
look for him in the pool," Courchaine said. "He knows how to play -- he knows 
where to be. And Darin, our goalie, is the best Magnolia has ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Said Weiss: "Darin is one of the main reasons we've been so successful." 
</P>
<P>
Schow, who has played goalie since the middle of his freshman season, shrugged 
off the praise. "I'm not that good," he said. "It's just a matter of knowing 
where the ball's going to be. After you've been in goal for a while, you can 
tell (who is going to take the shot) by the different facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense makes me better -- everyone helps everyone else out. It's not just 
one person on the team that's good -- we're all equal. If Jesse can't score, 
we'll give the ball to someone else and they'll score." 
</P>
<P>
That someone else is often the fourth senior, Shilaimon. 
</P>
<P>
"What usually happens is that teams will set up a defense to try and two-time 
Jesse," Weiss said. "(Then) Pete will pick up the slack. That's when he'll 
score his goals." 
</P>
<P>
Shilaimon, who came to the United States 10 years ago from Greece, says he does 
not feel badly playing behind LaVere. "Jesse's better than I am," he said. "I'm 
really happy for him. That's the thing with this team, we all work together." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he will rely on his four senior captains to take the team past the 
first round. In 1986, the Sentinels reached the second round, where they were 
eliminated by El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
If Magnolia wins today, it will meet the winner of the Dos Pueblos-Sierra Vista 
game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Goal-wise, I'd just like to get to, or past the second round," Weiss said.

HERDMAN, ANDERSON LEAD UCI'S EXHIBITION VICTORY

The UC Irvine basketball team, led by the outside shooting of Jeff Herdman and 
Justin Anderson, shot past High Five America in the second half for a 99-96 
exhibition victory Wednesday at Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman and Anderson, who figure to be the Anteaters' three-point specialists 
this season, looked in midseason form as they combined for 21 second-half 
points. They also made six three-point shots between them, Anderson making 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by their performance, UCI outscored High Five America, 41-19, in the 
game's final 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be encouraged when you're able to come back from 18 down against 
some pretty good ball players," UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
High Five America, an anti-drug club team that had defeated such teams as 
Villanova and Wichita State, featured Eric White (Pepperdine, Clippers) and 
John Hatten, who played for Cal State Long Beach last season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine trailed, 76-58, with 14 minutes to play. High Five America led by five 
at halftime and outscored Irvine, 22-9, in the first six minutes of the second 
half, building that lead with the help of five three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"That happened because one of their guys would beat one of ours, and when 
another one of our guys came to help they just dished off to the open man for 
the shot," said Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan was pleased with his team's offensive effort, but said the defense 
still leaves much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, Anderson and Rod Palmer each had 18 points to lead UC Irvine. High 
Five America was led by Doug Spradley, who had 21, and Pat Hamilton, who had 
20.

CEBALLOS HAS GAME-HIGH 37 IN TITANS' INTRASQUAD GAME

<P>
Cal State Fullerton's basketball team, struggling and uncertain a year ago, put 
on a solid and confident exhibition in an intrasquad game Wednesday night at 
Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The starters, in Blue, took a 57-29 lead at halftime before the lineups were 
shuffled. The Blue team eventually defeated the Orange, 103-74. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos, a first-team Big West Conference forward last season, scored 
37 points, and guard Mark Hill, the Titans' second-leading scorer last season, 
had 26. 
</P>
<P>
Among newcomers, freshman Aaron Wilhite, a 6-foot-7 forward, scored 16 points; 
junior guard Dareck Crane had 13; freshman forward Bruce Bowen had 12, and 
sophomore forward Agee Ward, ineligible last season under Proposition 48 
guidelines, had 11. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton struggled in its intra=squad game last season, with only 10 players 
available less than a week after George McQuarn suddenly resigned as coach. 
John Sneed, an assistant under McQuarn, replaced him and is beginning his 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
"You think of last year's intrasquad game -- it was almost an embarrassment for 
us," Sneed said. "I think we showed how much further along we are." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which has been picked to finish from second to fourth in the Big 
West, played with the pressing, running style that evolved last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he was particularly impressed with his team's passing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played very unselfish ball," Sneed said. "There was some good 
passing. That was a problem sometimes last year, passing and shot selection." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans must replace one starter, forward Derek Jones, and appear likely to 
start a smaller lineup that moves Ceballos to power forward and brings in 
senior Van Anderson and his defensive skills at small forward. Anderson had 14 
points Wednesday.

<P>
Webb Automotive Group said Wednesday that is has completed a $17-million 
acquisition of three import auto facilities in Irvine and is planning several 
major changes at the Orange County dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Webb, owner and founder of Webb Automotive, said he has acquired three 
Irvine Auto Center properties -- Irvine Nissan, Irvine Toyota and Irvine 
Mitsubishi -- from Cerrito Management Group of Los Gatos in Northern 
California. The three properties accounted for $71 million in gross sales for 
Cerrito last year, according to Auto Age magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight new car facilities the company now owns, five are in Orange 
County. Webb is one of the new breed of super dealers -- owners of multiple 
dealerships -- who are attempting to build car retailing networks that rely on 
customers' loyalty to a dealer rather than to a brand of car. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to acquiring the land and buildings, Webb took over operation of 
the Toyota and Nissan dealer franchises. But he closed down the Mitsubishi 
dealership and said he currently is seeking a domestic car franchise for the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a reflection of anything bad about Mitsubishi," he said. "It's just 
that I felt that having three foreign car dealerships in the same center was 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
Webb also believes that owning two Toyota dealerships within a 10-mile radius 
is too many. He said he intends late next month to consolidate Lew Webb/Son 
Toyota in Mission Viejo with the newly acquired Irvine Toyota -- which will be 
renamed Lew Webb's Irvine Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo lot will become a Lexus dealership, the first in South Orange 
County to sell Toyota's new luxury line. Webb also owns Toyota of Buena Park 
and plans no changes to that property. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said the parts and service departments at the Irvine Nissan and Toyota 
dealerships have reopened after being closed for several days for inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Sales operations at the two dealerships, however, will remain closed for two 
weeks for refurbishing. Webb said his company is spending about $1 million to 
re-roof the buildings, repair the parking lots and paint and replace carpeting 
in the showrooms and sales offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine dealerships were put up for sale almost three years ago at an asking 
price of about $20 million as Cerrito Management began searching for funds to 
keep its Northern California operations afloat. Before the sale, Cerrito had up 
to a dozen dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
All but the Irvine dealerships, however, were in and around Cerrito's home base 
in the Silicon Valley. Industry analysts said Cerrito launched a major 
expansion in Northern California just as the computer and aerospace industry 
crunches cut deeply into the area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he expects the addition of the new dealerships to his auto retailing 
group to propel it into the top rank of car dealers nationally next year, with 
combined sales of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
That would rank the Webb group among the top 25 new car dealers in the nation.

GOVERNMENT WILL PUSH FOR THRIFT MERGERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAVINGS AND LOANS: THE U.S. WILL PRESS FOR 'SHOTGUN MARRIAGES' BETWEEN 
STRUGGLING FIRMS AND THEIR STRONGER COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP A HEALTHIER

<P>
The government will press for "shotgun marriages" between struggling savings 
and loans and stronger competitors to build a smaller but healthier thrift 
industry, M. Danny Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the main thrift industry 
group, Wall said his agency would use the threat of penalties against thrifts 
to arrange mergers with potential suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling this our arranged marriage program. Where I come from, they 
would put the word 'shotgun' in there," he said. He said the program would 
start in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The forced mergers would apply to S&amp;Ls that fall short of tough new capital 
requirements issued by the office this week. As of June 30, seven Orange County 
thrifts were deficient in their capital levels, according to Sheshunoff 
Information Services of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The capital rules and merger programs are the latest steps by the chief federal 
regulator of the 2,900 U.S. thrifts to reform the industry after heavy losses 
forced Congress to pass a $159-billion bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said well-run institutions in the thrift industry, which is a major source 
of loans for home buyers, have been penalized for imprudent and criminal 
actions by some savings executives. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who has been heavily criticized by members of Congress, vowed he will be 
a diligent enforcer of new rules requiring thrifts to put more of their own 
funds at risk in the form of capital. 
</P>
<P>
The capital rules issued by the thrift office Monday will require many thrifts 
to increase their capital beginning next month as a cushion against losses, and 
if they cannot, to submit a plan to comply. 
</P>
<P>
If a cash-strapped thrift receives an offer to be acquired but is too coy about 
accepting, the regulators will have to consider whether the thrift's behavior 
violates a rule against operating in an unsafe manner, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will consider enforcement actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said as many as 300 thrifts could disappear into acquiring firms, which 
might be healthy thrifts, commercial banks or industrial companies, and will 
include non-U.S. firms.

He cited the $110-million investment of Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, the 
largest trust company of Canada, in Pacific First Financial of Seattle. Royal 
Trustco made the purchase as part of a major expansion plan in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Trustco also recently acquired insolvent Pacific Savings Bank in Costa 
Mesa in a federally assisted transaction. The federal government provided $550 
million and Royal Trustco pumped in $47 million in capital. The thrift will 
become part of the Pacific First network. 
</P>
<P>
Wall also said a Japanese firm is acquiring part of a Hawaii thrift for $20 
million. He did not identify either party in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Major international financial service organizations share our vision of a 
positive future for the thrift industry," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County thrifts are currently exploring ways to shore up their 
capital, including through the sale of assets, infusion of cash from new 
investors or mergers. Mercury Savings and Loan in Huntington Beach, for 
instance, recently hired an investment banker to explore a merger with an 
outside firm. The troubled thrift has lost $5.4 million in the first nine 
months of the year and as of June 30 had only half the capital required by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, the agency will soon issue rules that will specify when an 
undercapitalized thrift must limit or omit dividends to help build up capital, 
Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the number of thrifts that are insolvent because they have liabilities 
exceeding assets will continue to grow.

SALE BY COMPUTER AUTOMATION OF TEST UNIT FALLS THROUGH 
</P>

Computer Automation Inc. said Wednesday that the proposed $4-million sale of 
its automatic test equipment business to Technology Marketing Inc. of Irvine 
has fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Automation, a troubled vendor of mid-size computers and other 
electronic gear, announced on Sept. 21 that it would sell the test equipment 
unit -- which accounted for about 60% of the firm's $17.2-million revenue for 
the fiscal year ended June 30 -- to Technology Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
But the two firms were unable to come to a final agreement on terms and 
conditions of the transaction. Christopher Miner, chief financial officer of 
Technology Marketing, said "we didn't like what we saw" in proceedings that 
followed a September letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
The assets of the test equipment operation and the underlying business were not 
as strong as Technology Marketing had originally believed, Miner said. The 
company was interested in the Computer Automation unit because it complemented 
Technology Marketing's existing line of computer memory board test equipment, 
Miner added. 
</P>
<P>
William Osmundsen, chief financial officer of Computer Automation, said the 
company would seek another buyer for the division but that no discussions are 
now under way. The Irvine company reported a loss of $1.9 million for the nine 
months ended March 31, but still has not released earnings for the year ended 
in June 30.

<P>
Rock bands wearing cowboy hats? That's been done. 
</P>
<P>
Rock bands with each member taking the same name? That's been done, too. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came the Clints, an Orange County band that figured one way to 
invent a new promotional ploy was to splice together two old ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Clints maintain -- adamantly, although not very convincingly -- that each 
of the four band members really and truly has borne the name Clint from birth. 
They didn't sprout the black cowboy hats until two years ago, when the band was 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
This does not make the Clints promotional geniuses. It's hard to fathom why a 
band debuting in 1989 would want to rehash the image of the "cowpunk" bands who 
briefly rode the range in the early to mid-'80s -- especially because many of 
those bands (among them Rubber Rodeo, Rank &amp; File and Lone Justice) wound 
up in premature graves on pop's version of Boot Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The Clints figured that cowboy trappings would give the band an instant image, 
and an excuse to spin some wild Western tall tales about themselves, explained 
Clint Ambuter, the oldest Clint, whose shadowy beard would probably typecast 
him as one of the bad guys in a cowboy movie. Unlike the cowpunk bands, who all 
wove country influences into their sound, the Clints never intended to carry 
over any Western stylings into their music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even like country music. None of us does," Ambuter said. Instead, he 
said, it was sheer process of elimination that left the Clints wearing cowboy 
gear and planting their concert stages with fake cacti. 
</P>
<P>
"When the band was formed, we said, 'We can't go out and be punk, because there 
are so many out there with spiked haircuts.' We didn't want to be a glam band 
with long hair. Our music wasn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
But cowboy gear would stand out, they figured. And, after all, didn't everyone 
in the band already bear the first name of a certain hard-bitten film hero from 
the spaghetti Westerns? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe. Asked during a recent interview to produce legal identification 
verifying their authenticity, self-proclaimed Clints Ambuter, Wade and Harrison 
demurred, mumbling something about stolen or misplaced wallets. 
</P>
<P>
Setting aside the name game and the hokey cowboy jokes, the Clints' debut 
album, "No Place Like Home" is a solid, wide-ranging effort that holds up 
without recourse to gimmickry. While not afraid to let go with some 
satisfyingly noisy blasts of guitar feedback or toss in some punkish thrashing 
rhythms, the Clints always keep the emphasis on melody. On a couple of songs, 
they silence the raging electric guitars and speedily flailing drums and strum 
folksy, airy-sounding campfire music. 
</P>
<P>
Ambuter's husky singing voice recalls his hero, Peter Gabriel, and his songs 
about romantic trials and existential crises display an admirably lean and 
concise approach to lyric writing. Wade's songs -- flightier, abstract, and 
strewn with tangled thickets of words -- offer an enjoyably quirky counterpoint 
to his sidekick's concrete images and straightforward emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
The Clints admit that what's on the record doesn't mesh in the least with the 
band's promotional trappings: "The clothes don't tell you who we are. What 
tells you who we are is the songs," Ambuter said. 
</P>
<P>
Ambuter, 28, and Wade, 27, are childhood friends who grew up on the same block 
in Huntington Beach. "We used to take tennis racquets when we were 10 years old 
and pretend we were in a band," recalled Wade, an effusive talker with a sunny 
disposition. After playing together first in a progressive rock band, then in 
an early-'80s punk band called the Cement Bugs, the two guitarists hooked up 
about five years ago with bassist Clint Harrison, 25. The band's newest member 
is drummer Clint Villalobos, 24, who, the others say, was recruited through a 
musician-wanted ad seeking drummers named Clint. 
</P>
<P>
The Clints hooked up with a Los Angeles record producer, Dan Matovina, and made 
demo recordings that they say drew some big-label interest. But the first 
concrete offer came from Skyclad Records, a small New Jersey company that 
Matovina had approached at the New Music Seminar in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Skyclad said they could have the album out in three months, and the other 
labels could have still been talking about it in three months," Ambuter said. 
"It's a good way to start -- small and solid." 
</P>
<P>
Since the album came out in July, the Clints have gotten good notices in the 
alternative music press, as well as a fair amount of college radio airplay. 
While all four members hold day jobs, they plan to begin working in some 
touring outside Southern California, with dates in Northern California and Las 
Vegas set for after Thanksgiving. In the meantime, the Clints have a round of 
local shows coming up: Saturday at Bogart's with fellow Skyclad acts the 
Popelopes and Russ Tolman; Nov. 24 at the Meadowlark Country Club, with the 
Vandals; and a Nov. 25 acoustic set at the cozy Doll Hut in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
When "No Place Like Home" came out, it contained one surprise that had the 
Clints scratching their heads under those black hats. It turns out that the 
folks at Skyclad Records know a thing or two about grabbing attention with a 
promotional image -- the company logo printed on the record features a 
blood-red splotch set against a background photo of the exploding space shuttle 
Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that horrible?" Wade said. "Don't ask." 
</P>
<P>
The Clints play Saturday at 10 p.m. at Bogart's, in the Marina Pacifica Mall, 
6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Also playing are Too Many Joes, Russ 
Tolman and the Popelopes. Tickets: $6. Information: (213) 594-8975. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SO LONG: Jim Palmer, one of the leading figures in developing Orange County's 
alternative-rock scene over the past five years, has moved to Las Vegas. There 
is still an Orange County connection in Palmer's life, though: He'll be working 
as a concert promoter and publicist for Calamity Jane's, a rock nightclub 
co-owned by Coach House owner Gary Folgner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be dealing with bigger artists and management companies and record 
companies," said Palmer, an ex-Marine corporal who has been involved in the 
Orange County rock scene since 1984. "I'll still be in touch with Orange County 
as much as I can be. I still have a real interest in that." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer booked concerts at local clubs, released several albums by local bands 
on his own Out There label, and touted such upcoming Orange County bands as 
Imagining Yellow Suns, the Swamp Zombies and Don't Mean Maybe to others in the 
music business who could help them advance. Palmer said he will continue to 
operate his own national tour booking agency, Plaza Booking, although on a 
scaled-down level. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer has made one of his finest contributions as the organizer and promoter 
of the annual "Orange County Music For The Needy" benefit, which raises money 
and gathers food, clothing and toys to provide a festive Christmas holiday for 
poor families in the county. The daylong benefit also serves as a showcase and 
a get-together for the local rock scene. The fifth annual Music For The Needy 
benefit will take place Dec. 17 at the Coach House, with Dick Dale (solo), the 
Wild Cards, the Joe Wood Project, James Harman, and the Louisiana Cajun Trio 
among the featured acts.

DRAMARAMA MIXES SPACE AND TIME FOR PUNCHY, SELF-CONSCIOUS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All right: who messed with the space-time continuum controls at the Roxy? 
</P>
<P>
Dramarama -- the L.A. via New Jersey band that has built a loyal local 
following through KROQ airplay over the last couple of years -- performed last 
week decked out in colorful, '60s-ish shirts on a stage strewn with Love 
Generation flowers; its music reflecting an array of '70s glitter and punk 
influences, its audience a slam-dancing morass of collegiates and skinheads 
drawn to the band's '80s suburban-Angst themes. The group plays the Coach House 
in San Juan Capistrano on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, each of those phenomena was approached too self-consciously to 
simulate authenticity. But that didn't lessen the fact that Dramarama's music 
at its best carries a punch as real as the bruises the slammers took home. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the release of its new "Stuck in Wonderamaland" album (and 
suffering from some serious-sounding head colds), the band powered its way 
through 70 minutes of catchy but raw rockers and well-placed, self-doubt-laden 
ballads, spiced by tributes to David Bowie (an almost Neil Young-like version 
of "Sweet Thing") and the New York Dolls. John Easdale, singing like a cross 
between Iggy Pop and Ian Hunter and looking -- with his beard, shoulder-length 
hair and flat expression -- a bit like the Mad Monk, is a solid, sometimes 
compelling frontman. Still, something seemed to be missing. 
</P>
<P>
But if you (correctly) think of Dramarama as sort of the Replacements' older 
brothers, something's missing. The sextet shares the 'Mats overwhelming sense 
of emotional frailties while singing about the same kind of concrete 
inspirations ("70's TV") and needs (a "Last Cigarette" before bed). The 
frustrations -- sometimes specific, sometimes nebulous -- come through as real. 
</P>
<P>
But the band could pick up a few tips from its little "siblings." Replacements' 
shows are erratic, as likely to be a sloppy mess as a brilliant display, but 
(or because) they're tied to the emotions of the moment. They do (or don't) 
play particular songs simply because it's what they feel like doing right then. 
</P>
<P>
Although its stage command has grown by leaps an bounds over the last couple of 
years, Dramarama last week seemed as if it were doing songs because they were 
on the set list. And whatever aura of spontaneity might have survived was blown 
when Easdale preceded "Last Cigarette" by asking if anyone had a light for his. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama and Tommy Keene play Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Show time: 9 p.m. Tickets: $15. Information: 
(714) 496-8930.

Saturday will be a busy day at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the museum is holding a panel discussion in 
conjunction with the exhibit, "American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove." 
A lunch will follow the program at 12:30 p.m. At 2 p.m., the museum will show 
"Inter/National," a program of narrative and documentary videos. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the panel discussion will be video artists Doug Hall and Bill 
Viola; David Ross, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and 
moderator William D. Judson, curator of film and video at the Carnegie Museum 
of Art in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Judson was the curator of "American Landscape Video," which includes work by 
Hall and Viola. Ross, an art video expert, has written an essay for the exhibit 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $10 general, $7.50 for students and seniors. The lunch will cost 
$12 per person. 
</P>
<P>
"Inter/National" is part of an "LA Freewaves," a three-week celebration of 
video sponsored by the city Department of Cultural Affairs in Los Angeles and 
participating groups. 
</P>
<P>
One of four "road shows" traveling to various Southern California sites, 
"Inter/National" includes "Stories of Three Friends," the refugee experiences 
of three boys from Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, and a documentary about an 
American who introduced dance to disabled students of Changchun University a 
few months before the student protests in the People's Republic last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the screening is free with museum admission ($3 general, $2 for 
students and seniors, $1 for children ages 6 to 17). 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1., a free 3 p.m. show by Los Angeles performance artist Tim Miller 
will be the highlight of "A Day Without Art: A National Day of Action and 
Mourning" at the Newport museum. 
</P>
<P>
Part of a national art museum event in honor of AIDS Awareness Day, "A Day 
Without Art" seeks to honor and recognize colleagues who have died or are dying 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and greater support and recognition of 
AIDS sufferers from the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor will also offer free admission to the museum Dec. 1 and (from 
noon to 3 p.m.) an AIDS information table. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's 50-minute performance combines excerpts from three of his 
autobiographical works from the last six years: "Buddy Systems," "Some Golden 
States" and "Stretch Marks." Miller grew up in Whittier and attended La Habra 
High School before becoming a leading figure in the New York performance art 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"A Day Without Art" was organized by VISUAL AIDS, a New York organization of 
arts professionals that promotes AIDS-related exhibitions and events. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 U.S. arts groups are participating in the event, among them the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Getty 
Museum in Malibu and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The second annual AIDS Awareness Day is a project of the World Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Information: (714) 
759-1122.

TYPES OF HONEY VARY GREATLY IN TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Honey is not honey is not honey. Depending on the flowers visited by the bees, 
honey varies greatly in taste (from mild to strong) and corresponding color 
(from light to dark). Here, in order, is a list of honey from mildest (thistle) 
to strongest (buckwheat): 
</P>
<P>
Thistle, locust, tupelo, alfalfa, clover, sage, sourwood, palmetto, blueberry, 
blackberry, gallberry, goldenrod, aster, tulip poplar, Yucatan, buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these flavors -- alone or in combination with others -- are available 
at supermarkets, health-food stores and specialty shops. Two other honeys -- 
orange blossom and basswood (from the linden tree) -- have such distinct 
flavors that they are hard to include in any listing. 
</P>
<P>
Orange blossom has an extremely floral aroma and taste, just like walking 
through an orange grove, says honey expert Ann Harman. Basswood, on the other 
hand, "has a real snap to it; either you like it or you don't," Harman adds. "I 
do not recommend it for salad dressings" or in most recipes unless "you are a 
true devotee of basswood honey." 
</P>
<P>
Harman also doesn't recommend using sourwood honey for cooking -- but for a 
different reason. "It is considered one of America's finest honeys; it is very 
difficult to get. You are better off cooking with alfalfa or clover honey and 
saving sourwood as a table honey." 
</P>
<P>
The light honeys such as clover are very versatile and can be used in almost 
any recipe calling for honey. But they will not contribute a distinct taste, 
such as orange blossom honey, which is recommended for fruits and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
The heavier-flavored honeys, such as basswood and buckwheat, are good for 
barbecue sauces or chutneys -- even granolas. But they are not necessarily the 
best choice for delicate pastries. 
</P>
<P>
Many honey enthusiasts like eating honey straight from the honeycomb. The 
flavor is at its best then, says Russell "Pete" Roberson, former president of 
Roberson Honey Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The air hasn't hit the honey yet," he says. "It's just like eating a ripe 
peach off a tree or an ear of corn just pulled off the stalk. You get the true, 
full flavor."

2 INCUMBENTS, CHALLENGER WIN SCHOOL SEATS IN CULVER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a close race, voters Tuesday elected two incumbents and one newcomer to the 
school board of the Culver City Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The three seats will be filled by the top vote-getters: incumbent Julie Lugo 
Cerra, who got 1,548 votes, or 26.11% of those cast; challenger Jim Quirarte, 
with 1,544 votes or 26.04%, and incumbent Robert G. Knopf, with 1,465 or 
24.71%. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Supple came in a close fourth with 1,371 votes or 23.12%. 
</P>
<P>
Cerra, first elected in 1985, vowed Wednesday to "continue to be an informed 
member of the Board of Education." She said she will work on implementing 
strategic goals for the district, revising the curriculum and increasing 
"accountability for everyone -- parents, teachers, students, staff." 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old consultant said she wants to see a contingency program 
developed that will deal with "any disaster -- gang activity, threats, an 
earthquake." She added that student-athletes should be encouraged to strive for 
"lofty goals. . . . We don't want the athletes just to be athletes -- we should 
be monitoring their grades, giving them the tools to succeed," so they do "not 
just play a good game of football." 
</P>
<P>
Quirarte, 44, who manages property and is in the jukebox and vending machine 
leasing business, said he was surprised that he came in second and by the voter 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, (it took) about 800 votes, and you were elected," he said. 
"This time, it was (1,400). . . . The community is trying to send us a message 
that schools are important." 
</P>
<P>
Quirarte, who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1987, said he stood out from 
the other candidates in his call for beefing up vocational arts. Noting that 
only 34% of high school students nationwide graduate from college, Quirarte had 
stressed a back-to-basics curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Knopf, 46, said he placed third, behind a challenger, probably because his name 
was listed last on the ballot. The Hughes Aircraft Corp. engineer, who has been 
on the board since 1981, said he wants to expand the district's child-care 
programs and use computers to place students at their proper learning levels. 
</P>
<P>
But Knopf said the board's first job is to reach an agreement with teachers 
over salaries and benefits for this year. "Until the contract is settled, it's 
a (distraction to) the educational program. We're in the business of 
educating." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union and the district have a bargaining session set for today. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Los Angeles teachers recently won 8% pay raises for each of the 
next two years, Culver City teachers last month rejected a tentative agreement 
that included a 6% pay raise and new health benefits for retirees but had 
higher health insurance co-payments. Bess Doerr, president of the Culver City 
Teachers Assn., had recommended that the teachers approve the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said this week that a new survey of the rank and file showed that 
teachers, by at least 5 to 1, put salary as a top priority. She said the union 
would propose an 8% raise today. 
</P>
<P>
She said Cerra, Quirarte and Knopf will "do just fine for us." 
</P>
<P>
Cerra said: "Culver City is in a very bad position because of Los Angeles 
settling for 8%." She added: "It's also quite obvious that Los Angeles has 
bitten off more than it can chew," referring to the $180 million in budget cuts 
the Los Angeles Unified School District has said may be needed in 1990-91, 
largely because of rising salaries for teachers and administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Cerra, Quirarte and Knopf all said they would like to see Culver City teachers 
get pay hikes but only if the district is not forced into deficit spending. "I 
can't in good conscience lobby for something that will break the district," 
Cerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Supple said he was disappointed at losing but said he knew the race would be 
close. He lost, he said, because "I'm too straightforward, too blunt and I'm 
Republican." 
</P>
<P>
Supple, a parent and software engineer, said he would remain active on district 
advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
The newly elected members will be sworn in at the board meeting Dec. 5.

Photo, Calm Before the Galleria's Holiday Storm Design can be functional; it 
also communicates moods. The overall mood at the Galleria is one of serenity, 
isolation, sunlight and sweeping curves. The barrel-vault structure, above, 
tells customers they are outside, not inside a mall. Flowing cloth banners in 
bright colors such as maroon, yellow, light purple and orange and treated with 
fire retardants provide a soft counterpoint to the sweep and harshness of light 
fixtures. A light fixture bisects curving light display. And a mother and child 
are isolated in sunlight through skylight that spans 103 feet over Central 
Avenue and ties together Galleria One and Galleria Two. The peaceful, quiet 
atmosphere won't last, however. Christmas shopping season is almost here, and 
where a mother and child stand alone there will be crowds of shoppers before 
too long. RICARDO DeARATANHA / Los Angeles Times

PASADENA VETERANS MAKE PEACE WITH WAR

For some, the meetings have raised long-buried resentment and bitterness. For 
others, they have been a time of cleansing and of healing. And for a few, 
they've been the first time in nearly 20 years to talk about the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Vietnam War Memorial Committee, composed of about 40 city 
employees who served in the Vietnam War, has been working to find a site, 
design and money for a Vietnam War memorial in Pasadena for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The process has included a retreat at Vista Del Arroyo, a city-owned building 
near the Rose Bowl, and a daylong meeting in which the group members were 
encouraged to explore their feelings about the war and the proposed memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mixed bag of people who served, from basic infantry types to folks on 
ships, truck drivers, cooks, radio communications people and supply workers," 
said committee member Bruce Linsenmayer, a police sergeant. "Some of them have 
significant feelings about that whole event." 
</P>
<P>
Some reactions to the hope of a memorial, in a report presented earlier this 
week to the Pasadena Board of Directors, were: 
</P>
<P>
* "Peace of mind. Now finally this country is deciding that we weren't bad 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
* "Tell me that it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
* "Move past frustration. Sense of peace. Accord the proper respect, close the 
chapter." 
</P>
<P>
* "Walter Cronkite was full of (it)." 
</P>
<P>
Though the feelings vary, the veterans are united in their desire to ensure 
that Pasadena's memorial is not the tombstone type common in other cities, 
Linsenmayer said. They also want to ensure that it commemorates all who served 
in varying capacities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"GIs shooting something, that's how it's usually treated; and not everybody 
there was an infantryman," Linsenmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the committee is seeking a design incorporating the names of 
all Pasadena residents who died in the conflict and a map of Vietnam showing 
where they died. So far, 33 Pasadena residents have been identified; other 
names have been submitted and are being verified. 
</P>
<P>
The city last month advanced the committee $15,000 to advertise the design 
competition, which will be open not only to professional artists, but also to 
others in the community, such as high school and Pasadena City College 
students. 
</P>
<P>
A site has been chosen at Central Park, 275 S. Raymond Ave., but it must be 
approved by the city's Development Department and the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
About $5,000 in contributions has been received so far. The amount to be raised 
will probably depend on the design selected, Linsenmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee hopes to unveil the memorial by Labor Day next year. Said 
Director Bill Paparian, a committee member: "It will be a tribute not to the 
war, but to the warriors, and those who served and came back and are living 
productive lives, and to the missing from Pasadena."

New math: Eleven hundred guests. Ticket price $250. Net proceeds $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the booming bottom lines on Saturday at Saint Joseph Hospital's 60th 
anniversary gala, a black-tie dinner-and-show affair in the Anaheim Hilton. 
Proceeds will go into the hospital endowment fund, according to event chairman 
Brad Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Olson -- who also headed last year's benefit -- attributed the phenomenal size 
and financial success of the party to increased participation of doctors and 
other hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
"What put us over the top this year was the tremendous support we had from the 
medical community, both in ticket sales and in underwriting," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Lieberman, one of the four doctors on the party steering committee, said 
including doctors was "a novel idea" three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had ever really asked us to act as patrons," said Lieberman, a 
radiologist who has been with the hospital for 20 years. "We started getting 
involved three years ago, then we enriched it last year. This year, I made it a 
personal goal of mine to meet Brad's goal (of $200,000)." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman added that the big dinner ticket was easier to sell with the promise 
of a stage show -- this year, country gal Louise Mandrell. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're here to support the hospital," Lieberman said, "so we'd be 
here if the entertainment was Attila the Hun. But it's a lot easier to generate 
enthusiasm if people can look forward to a show." 
</P>
<P>
Playing to an audience that included nuns from the order of the Sisters of 
Saint Joseph, who founded the Orange-based hospital in 1929, Mandrell sang, 
danced, fiddled and shook her pink-culotted backside at the audience during a 
show-bizzy, hour-long set. Guests then hit the dance floor to burn calories 
with Barry Cole's orchestra until almost 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's new man: Also on Saturday, also big, Chapman College hosted its 8th 
annual "An American Celebration" benefit at the Anaheim Marriott, drawing more 
than 700 guests at $150 each and raising an estimated $250,000 for the school's 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
This year's event served as a getting-to-know-you party for new president Allen 
Koenig, who reported for work at the Orange campus on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig and his wife, Judy, met with board members and other notables in a 
private suite during cocktail hour. Between greetings and congratulations, 
Koenig -- who came to Orange County from Boston, where he was president of 
Emerson College for 10 years -- said he saw himself "first and foremost as an 
academic president. That's where my priorities are." 
</P>
<P>
While his party talk focused on college expansion -- Koenig has said he would 
like to see the 2,100-student enrollment up by as much as 50% within five years 
-- Judy Koenig had more modest concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, all I can think about is getting my kids settled in their new 
schools and getting them started with some new friends," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
James Moore, a college trustee and board member for 15 years, characterized the 
mood on campus as "filled with anticipation. Everyone's wondering what this 
(change of presidents) portends." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, trustee Chuck Martin is thinking positively. "In the '80s, 
(Chapman) went from financial difficulties to financial strength," he said. 
"The challenge for the '90s is building an institution that is recognized 
academically. I think we'll be thought of as among the 10 top small colleges in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Among others in the private reception were Bob and Debbi Elliott, who 
co-chaired the event; George Argyros, chairman of the board of trustees, and 
his wife, Judie; Myron and Lorene Cole; Dennis and Mary Lou Savage; Paul and 
Virginia Knott Bender, and Donna and John Crean, who wore a diamond hummingbird 
lapel pin. (Why a hummingbird? " 'Cause I'm known to flap my wings real hard 
and not go anywhere," he said.) 
</P>
<P>
Dinner entertainment included a video-and-slide introduction to the Koenigs and 
a tribute to Broadway that featured nearly 150 student singers, dancers and 
musicians, as well as a 60-member student production staff. As with the seven 
previous American Celebrations, the show was produced and directed by 
communications professor Ron Thronson.

ANN CONWAY: 'TIFFANY' AUTHOR'S PARTY IS A SPARKLER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Great American parties balance charity and civilizing moments of good will and 
refinement amidst the hubbub and irritations of modern life, rekindling joie de 
vivre in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Loring, "Tiffany Parties" 
</P>
<P>
It's an intimidating new book, the one written by John Loring, Tiffany &amp; 
Co.'s senior vice president and design director. 
</P>
<P>
The pages are splashed with breathtaking photographs of the kind of soirees 
(200 of them!) that every self-respecting socialite would sell her sable for: 
cocktails aboard the Trump Princess, a tea reception at Blair House (the 
official guest house of the U.S. President), the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
Costume Institute Gala, the Lyric Opera Ball in Chicago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now: Picture the worldly author (a near-and-dear of his editor, Jackie O., no 
less) of that ultrasophisticated tome coming to Orange County. Coming to Orange 
County to host a party. And picture yourself in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling a little iffy? 
</P>
<P>
Not if you're Electa Anderson. For this ardent supporter of the Center for the 
Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano, staging Sunday night's 
"Symbols of Celebration" was a piece of party cake. 
</P>
<P>
Her secret? The ability to "balance charity and civilizing moments of good will 
and refinement," just what Loring says in the foreword of his book. 
</P>
<P>
On the party agenda: serenades by Christmas carolers, cozy rooms filled with 
glittering Christmas trees, an exhibit of holiday drawings by Andy Warhol 
(commissioned for Tiffany's holiday cards in the '50s and early '60s and 
recently reissued), the chance to have a copy of "Tiffany Parties" signed by 
Loring, and, in the late hours, an ultraspecial supper laid out on "Tiffany 
Garland" ironstone for a privileged few. 
</P>
<P>
Among the holiday trees dazzling the guests was "Family Memories," decorated by 
Anderson herself. At the top was an angel, "given to me in 1949 by a Norway 
cousin," said Anderson, who loves to makes links with the past when she 
decorates for Christmas. If you looked closely, you could spot the 
pearl-and-rhinestone tiara she wore to her senior prom and some tiny fans 
Anderson made out of "old sheet music I had." There were even some vintage 
Christmas cards from her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to connect with past generations," Anderson said. "And we need 
to teach our children about past generations and why some of these things were 
so important to us at certain periods of our life. In a high-tech world, it's 
easy to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Other trees on display included an "Antique Doll" creation by Lynn West of 
Newport Beach, a "Christmas Tree With Birds," decorated by Tiffany &amp; Co. at 
South Coast Plaza, and "Winter White," decorated by Mary Rowe of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
After most of the 200 guests had departed, Loring was honored at an elegant, 
relaxed supper set up in the room graced by Anderson's holiday tree. On the 
menu: greens sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and triple cream bleu cheese, 
fresh Maine lobster and vanilla ice cream with almond brittle. 
</P>
<P>
One unadorned tree, to be embellished with trimmings designed by Mario Buatta 
(the decorator of Blair House), was up for auction. Maura Eggan, marketing 
director of South Coast Plaza, won it with a bid of $3,200 (the tree will be 
set up in South Coast Plaza's Nordstrom wing). 
</P>
<P>
Helping Anderson was her co-chairwoman, Kay Evans. Faces in the crowd: center 
founder and trustee Mozelle Redman, center director Gep Durenberger, Pat and 
Steven Gnadt, Dan Evans, Maxine Gaber, Dee Lawn, Jo Ellen Qualls, Gaye and Art 
Birtcher, Gavin and Ninetta Herbert, Wallace Neff, and Kitty and Charles 
Desmaris, director of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Let music ring: Thirty years of music education for children were celebrated 
Friday at the Irvine Marriott hotel when the Women's Committees of the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society staged their annual luncheon and fashion show. 
Fashions from Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza were shown after a lunch that 
featured Greek salad and mousse with strawberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On the "Let Music Ring" committee: chairwoman Marcia Coy, Wanda Cobb, Judith 
Ivey, Sara Mullarkey, Sherri Lawrence, Bobbitt Williams, Sharon Fair, Minna 
Dotzauer, Norma Clapp, Laura McKeever, Jane Grier, Christel Schar, Julie 
Jenkins, Sharon Upp and Peggy Crosby. Proceeds, estimated at $45,000, will be 
used to provide music programs to nearly 300,000 children in Orange County.

<P>
A 39-year-old man is believed to have shot and killed his daughter's 
17-year-old boyfriend during an argument over their romance, deputies said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Lopez, 17, was shot once in the head and pronounced dead at the scene 
in front of his South Gate house late Wednesday night, said deputy Van Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect apparently had gone to the house to try to stop the boy from seeing 
his daughter, Mosley said. Deputies declined to release the name of the man, 
who fled after the shooting.

Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, passed his last formal leadership post to 
his chosen successor today, and the Communist Party laid out an austere 
economic plan for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, resigned as chairman of the party's powerful Central Military 
Commission in favor of party chief Jiang Zemin. He still heads the State 
Military Commission, a virtual mirror of the party group, but said in a letter 
released today that he will also leave that job. 
</P>
<P>
The move solidifies Jiang's position and appears at least to suspend a reported 
power struggle between him and President Yang Shangkun. Jiang, 63, had not held 
a national post until his elevation to party leader after the pro-democracy 
movement was crushed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats and Chinese sources agree Deng is likely to remain the 
leading voice in party and government affairs, as he has been since leaving the 
Politburo and Central Committee in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Yang, an 82-year-old former general with strong army connections, was named 
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which sets military policy. 
He is reported to have sought the chairmanship to consolidate his power base. 
</P>
<P>
In another concession to Yang, a mastermind of the June military crackdown, his 
younger brother Yang Baibing, an army political commissar, was appointed 
secretary-general of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deng described Jiang, a former Shanghai party boss with a weak power 
base in Beijing, as the "nucleus" of the new leadership, many feel the party 
leader's political fortunes are tied to Deng's physical health. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency quoted Deng's resignation letter, dated 
Wednesday, as saying: "As early as 1980, I proposed reforming the leadership 
system of the party and state and abolishing the lifelong tenure of leading 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have insisted on not taking up day-to-day affairs and have been looking 
forward to completing the succession of the older generation by the younger 
generation as soon as possible and realizing my aspiration of completely 
retiring from the leading posts." 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee praised Deng as the "chief architect in all aspects of 
the party's and army's works." 
</P>
<P>
It said economic reforms Deng began a decade ago will continue, but for at 
least two years the people must "lead a thrifty life" to fight inflation of 
nearly 20% annually, too-rapid growth and corruption.

The Bush Administration, frustrated by Senate delays on its nominations, may 
give some of its 200 languishing nominees "recess appointments" that don't 
require Senate action, White House officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Such a parliamentary end run around the Senate's advice-and-consent powers 
would surely anger Democratic leaders and worsen already strained relations 
between President Bush and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anxious to do this. This is only a last resort. But it is something 
we may be compelled to do," an anonymous White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior White House aides are preparing recommendations for Bush on the 
procedures for making a possible batch of recess appointments during Congress' 
year-end break, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone granted such a "recess appointment" may serve, under the Constitution, 
until the end of the next session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all Presidents have made recess appointments from time to time. And it 
is a favored tactic for giving political supporters short-term jobs like 
ambassadorships near the end of a presidential term. 
</P>
<P>
However, the device has never been used in a wholesale fashion before.

Jurors who acquitted television actor Todd Bridges of attempted murder at a

against Bridges, prompting a mistrial. 
</P>

Bridges, who was featured on the television series "Diff'rent Strokes," was 
charged with firing eight shots at Kenneth (Tex) Clay and slashing his throat 
during a Feb. 2 attack at a South-Central Los Angeles house where crack cocaine 
was sold. The jurors earlier acquitted Bridges, 24, of attempted murder and the 
lesser charge of attempted voluntary manslaughter.

E. GERMANY OPENS BORDERS; 
</P>
<P>
CITIZENS CAN EMIGRATE TO WEST FREELY

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's embattled Communist leaders, facing the worst political crisis 
since the nation's founding 40 years ago, said today that they will throw open 
their borders and let citizens emigrate directly to West Germany, including 
through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party media chief Guenter Schabowski, who made the stunning 
announcement, said the new ruling is effective immediately. He said people will 
still need exit visas but police stations have been told to issue them without 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
The new ruling, decided after a more restrictive draft travel law met with 
widespread rejection earlier this week, was a major concession in a country 
that once tried to pen its citizens in with the Berlin Wall, barbed wire and 
automatic rifles set to fire on fleeing refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The move could leave the wall -- a symbol of the differences between East and 
West -- as a mere monument to the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany opened a legal route to the West through Czechoslovakia last 
Friday, leading to a weeklong renewed exodus from the country that reached over 
50,000 by today. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave 
the country through East German border crossing points," Schabowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabowski said the new ruling applies to all border crossings through the 
Berlin Wall to West Berlin and through the "Iron Curtain" frontier to West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials estimate that between 1.2 million and 1.4 million 
frustrated East Germans have applied to leave their Communist homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 have left so far this year, about half of them legally. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schabowski's statement, later carried by the official ADN news 
agency, private tourists intending to return also would be free to take any 
border crossing out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the announcement a "very positive 
development." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a basic human 
right. We've been talking a long time about open borders. We've been talking a 
long time about the importance of seeing the wall come down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's mass migration westward started this summer as its frustrated 
citizens began sneaking through the gap in the "Iron Curtain" provided by 
reformist Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
It escalated in September when Budapest threw open the frontier, letting out a 
flood of emigrants on "freedom trains" and their own sputtering little Trabant 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of East Germans packed Bonn's embassy in Prague to overflowing three 
times in the last two months, forcing East Berlin to allow three more waves of 
"freedom trains" to leave before it finally gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Since last Friday, East Germans have been able to take a legal exit route 
through Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, East Germany's Communist elite called an emergency party 
conference and a parliamentary session to tackle the country's deepest crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The decision-making Central Committee, still in special session after voting in 
a new ruling Politburo Wednesday, scheduled the conference for Dec. 15-17, and 
Shabowski said it might purge a large part of the present Central Committee.

BLACK DEMOCRATS TAKE CAPITOL VICTORY TOUR

Victorious black Democrats toured the Capitol today, and L. Douglas Wilder said 
his triumph in the Virginia governor's race proved that "Americans have come of 
age." 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), Wilder 
joked about the narrowness of his margin -- a majority his Republican opponent 
still questions. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to David N. Dinkins, mayor-elect of New York City, Wilder congratulated 
him and other Democrats, "some of whom had landslide victories like I did." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder was asked if racism was the reason he ran behind other Democratic 
candidates for statewide office, and he replied, "It says I had a very negative 
campaign being waged against me and my ticket-mates didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats were jubilant as they tallied gains that included the governor's 
mansion in New Jersey as well as the State Assembly and the election of blacks 
as governor of Virginia and mayor of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts of political trends among blacks hailed the results not only in 
Virginia and New York but also in such cities as Seattle; New Haven, Conn.; 
Cleveland and Durham, N.C., as "a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown, appearing with Wilder and Dinkins, said he 
believes that the election demonstrated that the Republican Party's stance on 
abortion is "an untenable position." He said he believes that President Bush 
has "painted himself into a corner" by taking a strong anti-abortion position. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Tuesday's election results show the Democratic Party "is not only 
alive and well, but strong and getting stronger."

U.S. BISHOPS HIT CONDOM EDUCATION;

The nation's Roman Catholic bishops today condemned teaching youngsters about 
condoms in public schools and called for Middle East negotiations leading to an 
independent Palestinian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement approved 219 to 4, the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops dropped earlier conditional support for condom education and urged that 
AIDS prevention instead emphasize chastity. 
</P>
<P>
"We caution young people not to be trapped into the 'safe-sex' myth, which is 
both a lie and a fraud," said Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS statement also defended the civil rights of AIDS patients but 
disapproved of programs that let drug users exchange dirty needles for clean 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast policy statement, approved unanimously, said Palestinians have a 
right to "participate as equals" in negotiations affecting their destiny and 
the right to clear title to territory. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion which follows from these assertions is as clear as it has been 
controversial: Palestinian representation in Middle East negotiations leading 
to Palestinian territorial and political sovereignty," the bishops said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the Arab states and Palestinians to recognize 
Israel's right to exist and said there must be negotiated limits on Palestinian 
sovereignty to protect Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said the statement is a "sorely needed 
invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
The Synagogue Council of America, which represents groups of Conservative, 
Orthodox and Reform Jewish congregations and rabbis, promptly accused the 
bishops of meddling in "the domain of the political entities involved." 
</P>
<P>
Grappling with two difficult issues on one day of their weeklong meeting, the 
bishops came out against universal mandatory AIDS testing and violence and 
discrimination against people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS statement drops a 1987 assertion by the conference's Administrative 
Board that the church could tolerate public schools providing information about 
condoms as long as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the 
"only morally correct and medically sure way" to prevent AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Some bishops complained that the 1987 statement could be misinterpreted as 
condoning sex outside marriage and artificial birth control, even though the 
document said the bishops did not approve of condom use. 
</P>
<P>
The new statement attacks condom education as a "quick fix" approach to the 
AIDS crisis that "can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials estimate as many as 1.5 million Americans have been infected 
with the AIDS virus, mostly through sex, tainted needles or infected blood.

During the maneuver, which started at 8:31 a.m. and will end Saturday night,

Alzheimer's disease may have afflicted 4 million people in the United States, 
about twice as many as previously thought, researchers said today. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the next century as many as 14 million Americans will probably 
suffer from the debilitating disease because people are living longer and the 
elderly segment of the population continues to increase, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
were based on the first survey to include victims of the disease who are being 
cared for at home, the researchers said. Previous studies have mainly dealt 
with victims of the disease who are already in nursing homes or other 
institutions.

The seller is to receive five-year notes from Compagnie Financiere Richemont 
AG, which holds a 36% position in Rothmans, in a transaction that Philip Morris 
said will result in a pretax gain of $450 million when completed.

Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, will retain the rights to

A consumer health group asked Congress today to revoke an agreement between a 
cigarette manufacturer and the National Archives that the group says "smears 
the Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans killed as a result of 
smoking." 
</P>
<P>
The August agreement makes Philip Morris Companies Inc. part of an Archives 
campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
A nationally televised public service announcement that is a part of the 
campaign includes the voices of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther 
King over images of the Bill of Rights and scenes from civil rights 
demonstrations. The announcement identifies Philip Morris as the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"This joint venture smears the Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans 
killed as a result of smoking Marlboro and other Philip Morris cigarettes," 
Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen Health Research Group, said in a 
letter to Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), whose Government Affairs subcommittee 
has jurisdiction over the archives. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign has nothing to do with cigarettes. It's about the celebration of 
the Bill of Rights," Guy L. Smith, vice president of corporate affairs for 
Philip Morris, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just sponsoring the messages, and the Archives is helping us to make 
sure they're historically accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Smith added that as of this morning, 200,056 people had requested a copy of the 
Bill of Rights offered by Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bill of Rights belongs to everybody," said Smith, likening his company's 
sponsorship of the campaign to that of American Express raising money to 
refurbish the Statue of Liberty.

The Wells Fargo capital withdrawal comes in the wake of an offer by the New 
York investment group Japonica Partners to buy AI for $638.8 million. The offer 
made late Wednesday is less than the $700 million Japonica bid last July for 
AI. Japonica said it would consider paying more than $700 million for AI if it 
is allowed to review certain undisclosed financial information.

NEA FACES BACKLASH FOR GRANT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One of the nation's largest arts groups suggested today that irreparable damage 
may have been done to the National Endowment for the Arts in a new controversy 
over cancellation of a grant for an art show on the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
And in Washington, a spokesman for a House subcommittee that will hold a 
hearing next week on the conflict between artistic freedom of expression and 
taxpayer rights said the panel's chairman is concerned that the new controversy 
may have so compromised the arts endowment that "it is no longer a vehicle for 
freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
The statements came in reaction to Wednesday's decision by NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer to cancel the $10,000 grant to Artists Space, a New York City 
artists group and gallery that has scheduled a Nov. 16 opening for the AIDS 
show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." The show includes some sexually 
explicit photographs and political commentary on various aspects of the social 
devastation brought about by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council for the Arts, said the arts 
endowment decision, which Frohnmayer said was taken because the "Witnesses" 
show was too politically risky in view of recent pressure on the NEA in 
Congress, places the federal arts agency in grave short-term and long-term 
danger.

CONCERT DELIVERS DIVERSE SCORECARD OF LLOYD WEBBER

<P>
Andrew Lloyd Webber's music gives some people goose bumps and other people the 
creeps. I liked his work through "Cats" and started to hate it with "Starlight 
Express." A chance to hear his theater scores as a continuum couldn't be passed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for attending "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" 
Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was to see Sarah 
Brightman. She is married to Lloyd Webber and played Christine in the original 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Brightman's vocal range may be wider than her emotional range, but within her 
limits she's a charming musical actress. 
</P>
<P>
Brightman is not ready to play Evita. "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" was sung 
with the proper drama, but we didn't get the creepy feeling that Evita had by 
now become a figment of her own imagination. 
</P>
<P>
But "Cats" was right up Brightman's alley. 
</P>
<P>
"The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" won't make converts to Lloyd 
Webber's cause, but it will please the multitude. 
</P>
<P>
A full review of "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" will appear in 
Friday's Calendar section.

MORGAN CUSTODY FIGHT FINDS NEW BATTLEGROUND

<P>
Six weeks after her release from jail, Elizabeth Morgan's dispute with her 
ex-husband, Eric A. Foretich, has become a hot property. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Foretich were married for less than a year, but since 1983 have been 
locked in a pitiless struggle for custody and visitation of their daughter, 
Hilary. In the weeks since Morgan's discharge Sept. 25, the two have found new 
battlegrounds. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, at least two competitors are racing to produce 
made-for-television movies -- one giving Morgan extraordinary control, the 
other an independent production that has upset Morgan's supporters. Foretich's 
attorneys say they are watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the two sides are raising money for rival trust funds for 
Hilary. Each intends to use its trust fund to fight the other on Hilary's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
They even have rival 800 numbers. The Friends of Elizabeth Morgan, at 
800-888-MRGN, provide daily tape-recorded updates on the case and exhort 
supporters to write letters on Morgan's behalf. The Help Hilary Home hot line, 
at 800-345-HLRY, rings in Foretich's dental office and seeks cash contributions 
and tips on the child's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Both have come to cast their fight as the emblem of a broader cause. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who accuses Foretich of sexually abusing their daughter, says she is 
battling for the rights of abused children in general against a legal system 
that fails to protect them. Foretich, who denies the charge and maintains that 
Morgan's decision to hide the child is tantamount to kidnaping, says he is 
battling for missing and exploited children in general against parents who take 
the law into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, before Morgan's release, Foretich seemed to be on the verge of 
withdrawing from the dispute, saying he was tired of fighting with Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Since Morgan won her freedom, Foretich has apparently changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, with the assistance of public-relations executive Vicki Lovett, 
Foretich launched the Help Hilary Home Trust to help him locate his daughter 
and to lobby for a federal law against what he sees as parental kidnaping.

"Dorf," a lovable buffoon played by comedian Tim Conway, has played golf, 
witnessed the first Olympic Games, and gone auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dorf is going to court. 
</P>
<P>
A production company is suing comedian Tim Conway, who plays the 4-foot-tall 
Derk Dorf character on videos, over the distribution of the tape "Dorf Goes 
Auto Racing." 
</P>
<P>
J2 Communications Inc., which claims to have the Dorf distribution rights, 
alleges in a Superior Court suit filed in Los Angeles Wednesday that Conway 
wrongly intends to sell "Dorf Goes Auto Racing" through another company. 
</P>
<P>
J2 Communications seeks unspecified general and punitive damages on various 
allegations, including breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair 
dealing, and fraud.

LIZ SMITH: HELPING THE QUAYLES REDECORATE THEIR D.C. NEST

"EINSTEIN'S three rules of work: (1) Out of clutter find simplicity. (2) From 
discord make harmony. (3) In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
This is from the new Safire/Safir quote book, "Words of Wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
LET'S GIVE some space to Paula Perlini, a decorator we haven't already heard of 
ad nauseum. She is getting ready to decorate the 
soon-to-be-structurally-renovated third-floor quarters of the vice president's 
children in the veep's home in Washington -- The Naval Observatory. At the 
moment, the young Quayles -- Corinne, 14; Tucker, 12; and Benjamin, 11 -- are 
living in a tiny rabbit warren of rooms, making do and muddling through, as 
they have had to do since last January. It is these youngsters who have had a 
lot of "adjusting" to do, plus the fact that they had to make new places for 
themselves as VIPs in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Perlini has been working for the last eight months trying to improve their 
lot. The Third Avenue-based, New York partner of Perlini-Tanksley Associates 
used to toil in the service of her very famous brother-in-law, that top man 
always seen in the pages of Architectural Digest and HG, the one and only Mark 
Hampton. Paula was working for Mark when he decorated the downstairs and second 
floor of The Naval Observatory for George and Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The Quayles think Hampton did a great job on floors one and two and these rooms 
have been left much as they were. Paula, recommended to Marilyn Quayle by a 
mutual friend, will do a tiny touch-up on the Quayle's second-floor master 
bedroom and sitting room. But her big challenge is how to design for the 
children when security is so strict that no plans of the observatory can even 
be sent to her. 
</P>
<P>
FROM TIME to time, Paula kids Mrs. Quayle by saying, "For heaven's sake, 
Marilyn, I'm not a terrorist!" But to make her projections, Paula has to go to 
Washington and study the carefully-guarded third-floor plans in private. She 
finds, however, that the vice president's wife is a person who is "lovely to 
work with. She is very bright. We have lunch, we laugh and we go around with 
the Secret Service. Mrs. Quayle knows what she likes, but admits she is no 
decorator and actually seems to like to take advice." 
</P>
<P>
NOW, JUST the other day, your Liz happened to find herself seated next to 
Marilyn Quayle at a luncheon. I discovered that her photographs do not begin to 
do her justice and her print image has not always come across as less than 
harsh. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle had a lot to say at lunch about her children and her feelings 
about being torn between devotion to them and the schedule she keeps. She 
talked of efforts in planning against natural disasters; her "cause." She told 
of going to an earthquake seminar last August in San Francisco and credits work 
done there with some of the preparedness attitudes that prevailed during the 
recent quake. Her remarks about all of this were dynamic and sincere.

<TEXT>

The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia says just say yes to legalizing drugs. "It's 
the obvious solution," he says in a Rolling Stone interview. "Greed and the 
desire to take drugs are two separate things. If you want to separate the two, 
the thing you do is make drugs legal. Accept the reality that people do want to 
change their consciousness and make an effort to make safer, healthier drugs." 
Later in the same interview, Garcia says he is glad he has beaten his own drug 
problem. "I'm glad I'm not involved in it any more," he says. "I really am. But 
I haven't come to any conclusions about drugs at all on any level. I don't 
think I've gained any particular insights."

Julian Bond, a leading figure during the civil rights movement and a former 
Georgia state legislator, denies that he is the father of a flight attendant's 
year-old daughter. Deborah Kaye Moore filed a paternity claim against Bond over 
her daughter, Mia, in September on the day after Bond, 49, and his wife of 28 
years, Alice, settled their divorce dispute. Bond says Moore never told him she 
was pregnant or that she had given birth. The matter comes up for a hearing

<P>
Former Formula One champion Ayrton Senna said today he is no longer sure he has 
the motivation needed to continue competing on the Grand Prix circuit. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Sao Paulo, the 29-year-old Brazilian said, "the 
possibility of abandoning Formula One exists and I am still debating with 
myself whether or not I have the motivation to continue racing. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the immediate future, all I can say is that next week I'll be training 
in Portugal." 
</P>
<P>
Senna said he started questioning whether or not it "is all worthwhile" after 
the Paris-based International Federation of Auto Racing slapped a six-month 
suspension and a $100,000 fine on him for dangerous driving in the 1989 Grand 
Prix championship race. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was lifted, but the 1988 Formula One champion will be on 
probation for six months next season. 
</P>
<P>
The punishment resulted from an incident in the Japan Grand Prix on Oct. 22. 
Senna bumped into teammate Alain Prost in a turn seven laps from the end, 
forcing the French driver out of the race. Senna finished first but was 
disqualified for not returning to the track at the same point he went off.

Minna Wilson, who clobbered one of her son's opponents over the head with a 
high-heel shoe, said today she won't be anywhere near the ring when Tony Wilson 
and Steve McCarthy square off in a rematch of their light-heavyweight bout next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been going to his fights for years, even when he was an amateur, and 
after fights I have shaken the lads' hands," she said today. "This time, I 
don't know what happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was merely reacting to chants shouted at her son by members of the 
crowd that night last September in Southampton, England, shouts that she 
considered racist. The Wilsons are black. McCarthy is white. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had just been floored by McCarthy in the third round at Southampton 
Guildhall when his mom climbed into the ring, took off one of her high-heeled 
shoes and started beating McCarthy over the head. McCarthy required four 
stitches in his scalp and refused to continue the bout, which made headlines 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The referee awarded the decision to Wilson, the first loss of McCarthy's 
career, and -- while upholding the judgment -- the British Boxing Board of 
Control ordered a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and McCarthy are to meet again in suburban Reading on Nov. 15, where 
promoter Frank Warren said there would be three times the normal number of 
police and security guards to control the crowd.

Track and field's international governing body asked East Germany today for 
details on 14 of the nation's athletes who reportedly failed drug tests in the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation said it had asked the East German 
track and field federation to supply information in the wake of newspaper 
reports in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt, one of East Germany's biggest newspapers, reported Wednesday that 
14 positive results for drugs had been found among East German athletes tested 
at national meets or training sessions in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the names nor the sports of the athletes were released. 
</P>
<P>
No prominent athletes from East Germany, the second-biggest medal winner at 
last year's Olympics, have been named in international doping tests in recent 
years although reports in the Western news media recently have said that drug 
use among the nation's top athletes was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report quoted Manfred Hoeppner, chairman of the East German 
anti-doping commission, as saying that the athletes and coaches involved in the 
drug use had been punished. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeppner also told the newspaper that beginning next year East German 
authorities will publish the names of athletes caught using drugs.

Houston Oilers Coach Jerry Glanville has invited Astros Manager Art Howe to 
stand on the sideline during next week's game against Cincinnati in an effort 
to confuse the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have Art dress exactly like (linebackers' Coach) Floyd Reese -- 
they look identical -- and have them both stand there and flash defensive 
signals," Glanville said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bengals may be the greatest team in the league at stealing hand signals. 
But they won't know which one's Floyd and which one's not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville said he set up the hoax during a telephone call to Howe's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just doing it because Art wants to come to the game. It has nothing to 
do with Cincinnati, but we'll still make a big deal out of it," Glanville said.

California Derby Trials at Los Alamitos. David Payne's 3-year-old quarter horse 
ran the 440 yards in :22.09, giving him a berth in the finals, which will be 
run Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Fastest qualifier for the Derby was Swartz and Vener's Floozie Finder, winner 
of the second trial. Floozie Finder led his field to the wire in :21.83 
seconds. Seven horses from the second division qualified for the final, with 
just the top three finishers from Rambac's heat advancing to the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Rambac defeated Making Merri by a neck, with Challenger Seven another neck back 
in third. Rambac paid $2.40, $2.20 and $2.20. Making Merri paid $2.80 and 
$2.60. Challenger Seven paid $3 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Floozie Finder was the 3-1 second choice in the eight-horse second division. 
The Barry Woodhouse trainee defeated Heres Happiness by a half length, with 
Final Flurry another neck back in third. Lil Rebel Cash, Secret Meeting, 
Shillings, Mary Bobbitt and The Big Kahuna completed the order of finish. All 
but The Big Kahuna advance to the final from the second division. 
</P>
<P>
Floozie Finder paid $8.20 to win, $4.60 to place and $2.40 to show. Here 
Happiness returned $7.20 and $3.20.

<P>
On Wednesday morning, 1,500 NFL players awoke to find an old truth suddenly in 
question. There was no talk about one for all and all for one. The talk was 
about every man for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was the decision by the executive committee of the NFL Players 
Assn. to surrender its bargaining rights and begin the process of decertifying 
itself in its latest skirmish with management. For the San Francisco 49ers, 
reaction to the prospect of life without a union ranged from disbelief to firm 
support. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain. If decertification occurs -- and there is a solid 
possibility it won't -- the result could be chaos. As 49ers player 
representative Bubba Paris put it, "Every player will be his own individual 
negotiating unit" under the new system, a scenario that would, by all accounts, 
prompt a flurry of lawsuits and unusual contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
To Paris, the move to decertify was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's been a crazy, long, roundabout way to come to these 
circumstances, but the players have slowly lost their rights to collective 
bargaining," he said. "Everything we've fought to gain is in the process of 
being taken away. In essence, we've been pushed up against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The only other option, Paris said, was "a long, lengthy appeals process," but 
some see the decertification as a ploy similar to the one used by the NBA 
Players Assn. in 1988, when the NBAPA threatened to decertify, did not follow 
through and then signed a six-year plan with management two months later. 
</P>
<P>
"The union isn't going to decertify," 49ers running back Tom Rathman said. 
"We're going to get a contract before that." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Paris, who said the 49ers was the team that paid the highest dues 
in pro football last season, insisted the NFLPA isn't abandoning the players, 
some players may not agree. 
</P>
<P>
The players must vote on the final move to decertify. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I'd like to see free agency, I don't see how it could work," 49ers 
backup quarterback Steve Bono said. "I would vote to not decertify. I think 
everybody needs a union in some respects. Everybody would be abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
Paris acknowledged that the NFLPA and Executive Director Gene Upshaw have 
something to prove to the players. Upshaw was given generally poor marks for 
his performance during the 1987 strike, and this latest setback can't help his 
reputation any. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any doubt we'd win," said Paris of the union's reaction to the 
defeat. "We're extremely shocked. It's completely against what we'd been led to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beyond muscle-flexing. A lot of players lost faith in Gene when we went 
out on strike and didn't win. And I think others lost faith when the agreement 
went against them. To save face, we've got to do something in the players' best 
interests."

MOVIN NORTH THE FILLY TO BEAT AT LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The La Jolla Handicap and the Huntington Beach Stakes, both at 350 yards, will 
spotlight 2-year-old fillies and 3-year-old Cal-breds on Friday night's 12-race 
card at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Movin North has never been off the board in five races and figures to be the 
filly to beat in the field of 10 for the La Jolla. The 2-year-old filly by Easy 
Dozen finished third in her first two starts. In her third start she showed 
amazing speed winning her trial for the Breeders Classic Far West Futurity in 
17.61 seconds, fastest qualifying time for the Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Movin North was purchased privately by Bob and Frances Wieland. Movin North 
went on to win the Far West, and in her last start, the trials for the Ed Burke 
Memorial Futurity, she finished second by a nose but failed to qualify for the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
Movin North worked 12.4 seconds in preparation for the La Jolla and will have 
regular rider Jim Lewis up for the $10,000-added sprint. 
</P>
<P>
The David Payne's entry of Miss Missile Bug and Puppy Tac figure to receive 
strong support off their excellent form since joining all-time leading female 
trainer Connie Hall's barn. Puppy Tac and Miss Missile Bug arrived in 
California as maidens, after six and seven starts respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Puppy Tac was first to break her maiden and did it in style winning her 
qualifying heat for the Governor's Cup Futurity in 17.69 seconds, qualifying 
for the finals. The daughter of Tolltac finished fifth in the finale and since 
has won the Pacific Handicap and finished second in the Ed Burke Memorial 
Futurity trials. She didn't make the finals of the Ed Burke and has been idle 
since Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Missile Bug made her West Coast debut a little over a month later than 
Puppy Tac with the same result, an impressive win. Miss Missile Bug ran away 
from a maiden field, sprinting 350 yards in 17.63 seconds. In two starts since 
she has a fifth and a second, both in futurity trials. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach is restricted to Cal-breds and will have recent stakes 
winners Collectors Series and Bedadoc in the field of 10. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors Series, one of the most consistent 3-year-olds on the grounds with 
four wins, three seconds and two thirds in 10 starts, defeated Bedadoc in the 
California Sires Derby on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
In the California Sires Derby, Collectors Series was all out at 400 yards to 
hold off the fast-charging Bedadoc. Tonight's 350-yard distance could give the 
edge to the fast-breaking Collectors Series. 
</P>
<P>
Bedadoc has a record of one win, seven seconds and two thirds in 13 starts. The 
son of Merridoc didn't break his maiden until his victory in the San Luis 
Obispo on Nov. 4. The Dennis Ekins-trained roan is extra sharp right now and 
must be given strong consideration as he shoots for his second straight stakes 
win.

ACTIVIST UNSEATS INCUMBENT IN MOORPARK SCHOOL BOARD RACE; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA COUNTY: THE FUTURE OF AN OLD, CLOSED HIGH SCHOOL PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE 
IN A CLOSE ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Preschool director and community activist Pamela Castro emerged a victor after 
a close race in Tuesday's Moorpark Unified School District election, edging out 
Lynda Kira, one of the incumbents Castro tried to recall last year. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Parks and Recreation Commissioner Sam Nainoa also captured one of two 
openings on the five-member school board, garnering the most votes among six 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate the winners and hope they all work together for the education 
of kids," Kira said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In other Ventura County elections, incumbents on the Oak Park and Ventura 
County boards of education also were defeated. The elections drew about 18% of 
the county's 253,497 eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, a 1970 graduate of Moorpark's former Memorial High School, grounded her 
campaign on a crusade to save her alma mater, benefiting from her ties to the 
city's downtown section -- the old high school's location and Castro's own 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the old high school, which was closed last year in favor of a 
new, larger facility, has been the center of a bitter dispute between the 
school district and city. The growing school district wants to lease the 
majority of the Casey Road property to a private developer and use the money to 
build new schools. But the city wants to turn the most desirable portion of the 
26-acre site into a public park that would mainly serve downtown residents. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the old high school prompted Castro and others to launch a recall 
movement against four school board members last year -- including two members, 
Tom Baldwin and Patty Waters, whom Castro now will have to work with. In turn, 
Castro used the recall effort as a springboard for her own successful 
candidacy. With 744 votes, or 22%, she topped Kira's 683 by less than two 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Nainoa, who said he will resign from the city's parks and recreation board at 
its regular meeting Monday, captured about 24% of the vote with 819 ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Nainoa, a 45-year-old engineering manager at a GTE Corp. subsidiary, said his 
top priority would be smoothing relations between the school district and the 
city, which have been involved in two lawsuits since August. 
</P>
<P>
Castro could not be reached for comment, but she has favored retaining the old 
high school property as either a school or the district's central office, and 
allowing residents to continue using its ball fields and basketball courts as 
they do now. 
</P>
<P>
Election returns show Castro did best in downtown polling districts where 
voters would be most affected by the old high school's redevelopment. In 
addition to their desires for a park, downtown residents have expressed concern 
about the traffic that could be created if the old high school is redeveloped, 
according to plans, for 352 apartments and a business park. 
</P>
<P>
How those plans might be affected by Castro's and Nainoa's presence on the 
school board was unclear Wednesday. Both winners have strong ties to the City 
Council, which sued the school district over the old high school and opposes 
dense development of the site. 
</P>
<P>
The other losing candidates were construction manager John Roberts, with 483 
votes; college professor Thomas Bryan, 316 votes; and finance executive James 
Stueck, 314 votes. 
</P>
<P>
In a special election for the Thousand Oaks City Council, attorney Bob Lewis 
trounced seven other candidates for the unexpired term of Lee Laxdal. Laxdal, 
who appointed Lewis to the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission and worked with 
him on the city's slow-growth ordinance, moved to Australia last summer. Lewis 
is expected to resign from the commission to complete Laxdal's term, which ends 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis received 4,173 votes, followed by K. Reed Harrison, 2,946; Elois Zeanah, 
2,168; Phyllis Ellis, 599; Gregory Spencer, 365; Jim Donovan, 227; Grant 
Peterson, 210; and Norm "Blackie" Jackson, 129. 
</P>
<P>
In the Conejo Valley Unified School District race, incumbents Mildred Lynch, 
William Henry Jr. and Dorothy Beaubien recaptured their seats. Newcomer Richard 
"Dick" Newman -- a Conejo Valley parks commissioner, school volunteer and 
retired police lieutenant -- not only won a fourth opening on the school board 
but was the election's top vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
None of the Conejo Valley's board members have school-age children, an issue 
raised during the campaign by candidate Jeanie Mortensen Savage, a mother of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Newman received 4,843 votes, followed by Lynch with 4,655; Henry, with 4,059; 
Savage, 3,909; Martha deBurgh, 3,852; Charles Rittenburg, 3,164; Michael Sean 
Markey, 2,194; Ken Penchos, 816; Vance "Skip" Rodgers, 692; and N. Chuck 
Castaing, 685. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oak Park Unified School District race, Patricia Kavulic was the only 
incumbent to win reelection. Incumbents Richard Daley and David Ross were 
defeated by newcomers Wayne Blasman and Robert Kahn in a close race for three 
openings on the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Blasman received 516 votes; Kahn, 494; Kavulic, 453; Ross, 436; Daley, 283; and 
Sharon Catcott, 277. 
</P>
<P>
And in countywide Ventura races, the son of Supervisor John Flynn was narrowly 
defeated by engineer Pete Tafoya for a seat on the Ventura County Community 
College District board. Tafoya received 2,572 ballots, or about 53% of the 
vote, while Timothy B. Flynn, an account executive, received 2,298 ballots, 
about 47% of the vote. Tafoya will represent Oxnard and Port Hueneme on the 
five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
In another community college board race for the seat representing Thousand 
Oaks, dentist Gregory Cole of Newbury Park defeated Thousand Oaks attorney Joel 
Bryan with 61% of the vote. Cole received 6,889 ballots and Bryan 4,342. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ventura County Board of Education race, incumbent Fauvette Bean Rollyson 
was challenged for the first time in 15 years and defeated by opponent Al 
Rosen. Rosen received 3,092 votes, while Rollyson got 2,829. He will represent 
the district encompassing Simi Valley, Moorpark, Fillmore and Piru on the 
five-member board.

L.A. EIGHTH-GRADERS IMPROVE TEST SCORES DESPITE STRIKE

<P>
State schools chief Bill Honig owes teachers union president Wayne Johnson a 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, just as eighth-, sixth- and third-grade pupils were taking the 
annual California Assessment Program tests, Johnson, head of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles, was gearing up for a strike in the state's largest school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have real problems" with the CAP scores because of the looming 
strike, Supt. of Public Instruction Honig recalled warning Johnson. "No way," 
Johnson shot back, and the bet was on. 
</P>
<P>
This week, when the state Department of Education released the test results, 
Honig prepared to pay up. Los Angeles Unified School District eighth-graders' 
average scores showed improvement in every area: They climbed six points over 
last year's scores in reading, five points in math, eight points in social 
studies and six points in science. 
</P>
<P>
The district's younger pupils did not fare quite so well. Third-graders dropped 
slightly: one point in reading, two points in writing and one point in math, 
continuing a pattern of slow decline in all topics since 1985-86. Sixth-graders 
went up two points in reading, slid three points in writing and stayed even in 
math. This was the second year in a row that sixth-graders showed improvement 
in reading. 
</P>
<P>
While the district remained well below statewide averages in all subject areas, 
education officials said the results are far from bad news. Honig said the 
district's improvement in eighth-grade scores shows officials "are responding" 
to a mandate to improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the state released average scores but did not provide individual 
schools' results or scores for each test subject area until later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Possemato, associate superintendent in charge of instruction for Los 
Angeles Unified, said district officials are "very pleased" with the 
across-the-board improvement in eighth-grade scores but remain unsatisfied with 
its students' continued lower-than-average test results. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district has a rapidly increasing proportion of pupils with 
little or no proficiency in English -- 16.6% of the eighth-graders who took the 
CAP tests last spring, 23.4% of the sixth-graders and 41% of the third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes our students who are very capable in a subject matter can't deliver 
as well on the test," Possemato said. "That's an issue, but that's not an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to provide a full program that leads to achievement by our students, 
and we're going to do it," Possemato said, adding that district staff members 
are prepared to scrutinize school-by-school results over the next month to 
identify problems. He expects that it will take several years to bring the 
district up to statewide averages. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Glendale and La Canada unified school districts continued to do 
well on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's eighth-graders, for example, had a combined score of 278, well above 
the state average of 263. Its three-year growth in test scores averaged just 
one point, usually a cause for worry for education officials. But Honig, 
singling out Glendale as a high-achieving district, said its consistently good 
test scores should overshadow any concern about a low growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
Although scores in some La Canada schools fell from last year, they were still 
high. The lowest score earned by any group of La Canada pupils in any subject 
area was 306. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 100 
and more than 400, and may be compared to district and state averages. For 
example, if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state 
average is 278, children at your school are performing at a higher level than 
most third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The state has eliminated the written expression portion of its eighth-grade 
multiple choice test and replaced it with an essay test. The results of the 
essay test will be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
Dashes indicate that tests were not given or that scores were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in this section generally are in the central Los Angeles area and 
Glendale. Additional scores are in the appropriate suburban section. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sample Question 
</P>
<P>
Illustrative social studies passage: 
</P>
<P>
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new 
plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail 
service to California -- the pony express, which would deliver the mail in ten 
days or less. 
</P>
<P>
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. 
These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They 
had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. 
You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go 
through!" And it did go through! 
</P>
<P>
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or 
mochila. In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars 
was the usual price for sending a letter. 
</P>
<P>
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode 
nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used 
were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was 
thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were 
saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the 
saddle -- and off like the wind!

WINLESS WARRIORS; 
</P>
<P>
SPIRIT IS STRONG DESPITE THE TEAM'S BLEAK RECORD; PIUS X HAS LAST CHANCE FRIDAY 
TO END LOSING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bright spot in Pius X High School's most recent loss, other than that a 
touchdown finally was scored to end a bleak succession of five shutouts, was a 
125-pound running back. 
</P>
<P>
With one game left on its schedule, Pius X has an 0-8 record, due mainly to 
lack of talent. The Warriors, winless last year, have scored four touchdowns 
this season and given up an average of 44 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
But the team's hard times have induced in the Downey school a hopefulness that 
a breakthrough lies just ahead. Spirit is high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for me, but heck, I've got to be positive," said Mike Gallegos, the 
new head coach. "I think the future here is good. Sophomores come up to me and 
say, 'Coach, when we're seniors we're going to win the league championship.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pius X's sophomore/freshman team has not lost a Camino Real League game. 
</P>
<P>
The varsity, though, has been so vulnerable that there had been speculation 
undefeated Serra might score 100 points against it. Serra settled for a 52-8 
victory two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry at the kids," said Gallegos, 26, who was a nose guard on the 
1982 Pius X team that was undefeated until the playoffs. "They play tough, they 
just don't have the ability." 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches are empathic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't envy them at all," said Steve Carroll, whose Bishop Montgomery team 
beat the Warriors, 20-0. "Talent-wise it was evident they're struggling. It 
happens sometimes in cycles at schools, when there just won't be enough talent 
to go around." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Kenneth Johnson, in an early season game program, wrote that "this 
year's Warriors are building on a rich tradition of athletic excellence." The 
program listed the 14 former Pius X players who made all-CIF, beginning with 
linebacker Jim Grissom and quarterback Larry Diel in the mid-1960s and 
including, in 1976, running back Darrin Nelson, now with the San Diego 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
No one from this season's team likely will join that list. "We don't have an 
athlete you can base an offense or defense around," Gallegos said. "We just 
have grunts." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have one returning starter from last season. Their two 
quarterbacks had never played quarterback. Only four players weigh more than 
200 pounds. Devon English, who weighs 125, has become the team's star after 
gaining 140 yards against Serra. 
</P>
<P>
Ten players who were freshmen three years ago are no longer at Pius X. Three 
all-league candidates left before this season: quarterback Thomas Lyons, who 
transferred to Dominguez; tight end Robert Moss, who left for Lynwood, and 
running back Jabbar Thomas, whose family moved to Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos, who returned to his alma mater after a season as an assistant at 
California High in Whittier, thus inherited an inexperienced team that has been 
mistake-prone. But everyone tries. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hired to bring in some enthusiasm and set some roots here," said 
Gallegos, who at only 5 feet 5 himself is easily patted on the shoulders by 
admiring students. "I've got the enthusiasm. What we've got to get is more 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment, which had been declining, held this year at 750 students. Johnson, 
who is recruiting eighth-graders in area parishes, said he expects it to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Pius X students, 86% of whom are Catholic, come from South 
Gate. The school lies on the Downey-South Gate border and competes for students 
with St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
English, the junior running back, lives in Compton. "My pop wanted me to go to 
a Catholic school," he said. "Plus, I wanted to get away from all the gang 
violence around my home." 
</P>
<P>
The athletic director is Mike Murphy, who is also the basketball coach. 
Standing in a wide, unlittered corridor outside the religion class he teaches, 
he said, "Our school spirit is outstanding, the best I've seen it in years. 
This is a great place, an exciting place to be." 
</P>
<P>
It is a quiet, college-preparatory coed school. The voices of teachers drift 
from classroom windows to a grassy area of hanging plants, trimmed trees and a 
statue of Saint Pius X. Inside, a bulletin board hanging on a pale yellow wall 
contains notices about essay contests and a calendar listing impending visits 
of academic recruiters from Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
The academic emphasis was noticeable even at football practice last week in the 
Warriors' attractive little stadium. Players discussed chemistry and anatomy as 
they waited to join a kick-return drill. Four players, Gallegos said, have 
perfect 4.0 grade-point averages. 
</P>
<P>
A misfortune far greater than a losing football team befell the school in 
September, 1988. A $2-million fire destroyed the library. Now rebuilt, the 
library, with its computers and 14,000 new volumes, is a source of pride. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery from the fire, Johnson believes, has been a factor in the spirit 
students have displayed toward the football team. 
</P>
<P>
As for the spirit of the players, junior lineman Marcello Retamosa said: "We're 
not really down. The juniors have a lot of confidence and hope for next 
season." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel bad, but not humiliated," added center Ruben Salas. "We're out here to 
have fun. We always tell each other it's not going to happen again, but. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
The last chance for victory for Salas and the other seniors will be Friday 
night when the Warriors play host to St. Bernard, whose record is 4-5. Optimism 
is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have a shot against those guys," Gallegos said. 
</P>

BRILLIANT CHILDREN SPARKLE, STANDING OUT FROM THE CROWD, BUT THEIR PROBLEMS ARE

Jennifer Lindsay awoke one morning with a vivid dream still pirouetting through 
her mind. So she sat down and wrote a poem about it: 
</P>
<P>
The Earth itself is a ballet performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its stage is the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
Its movements are slow but calculated. 
</P>
<P>
In its own microcosm it continues the dance, 
</P>
<P>
twirling and whirling on its axis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She is only 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Her poem, "The Dance of Infinity," placed first last summer in the Orange 
County Fair's literary competition for children. Although a relative newcomer 
to the universe, Jennifer thinks in terms of eternal space and time. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream started with the earth. Then the picture suddenly got larger and 
became the solar system, then got larger again and became the galaxy, then got 
larger again and became the whole universe. I felt like I was there, watching," 
she recalled. "I get a lot of ideas from dreams." 
</P>
<P>
She illustrated her four-part composition with otherworldly portraits: bright 
blue and red planets circling the sun, the galaxy coated in its milky veil, 
stars sparkling in an endless sky. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah. The youngster can draw, too. 
</P>
<P>
And beat adults at chess. And play Vivaldi's Third Movement on the violin while 
coolly staring you straight in the eye, as if there were no feat easier. And 
sing "Ava Maria" -- in Latin, of course -- with a voice so big, so womanly that 
it's a bit disconcerting to hear coming from her child-size body. 
</P>
<P>
Trophies and ribbons abound throughout Jennifer's Fountain Valley home. She has 
won dozens of awards for swimming, her favorite activity. She has won chess 
tournaments and art contests. 
</P>
<P>
She dances ballet. She roller skates. She karate chops. She does algebra. She 
speaks French a little. She reads English a lot. "I'm a readaholic," Jennifer 
proclaimed. "I mostly read mysteries -- Nancy Drew books." 
</P>
<P>
Is she bad at anything? 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer pondered the possibility. "Soccer," she solemnly answered. 
</P>
<P>
"You've never played soccer," her mother, Gloria Lindsay, pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. So I'm bad at it," Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Prodigy" is not a label to be tossed about casually. "A prodigy is way off the 
graph -- with 180 IQ points, or unusual creative skills that cannot be 
adequately measured using IQ tests," explained Justin Call, chief of child and 
adolescent psychiatry at UC Irvine's School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the definition, Jennifer surely approaches qualification. 
</P>
<P>
As does Ruby Cheng. The Santa Ana 11-year-old already has earned a lifetime's 
worth of awards for her musical prowess. Ruby placed first in the Cal State 
Fullerton Piano Competition in 1987 and '88, and in the Cypress College Piano 
Competition in '87 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
Her talent is almost as amazing to watch as it is to hear. She seems at one 
with the keyboard, her hands an appendage of the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at her fingers," her mother, June Cheng, suggested. They would be 
exceptionally long even in adult proportions, but their elegant span is 
magnified sprouting from Ruby's small palms. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby began developing her gift at the age of 5. Today she practices the piano 
three hours every afternoon, reserving enough study time to maintain her 
straight-A average at Hewes Middle School in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally I lose myself in the music," she said. "It's really nice when 
that happens. More than nice, it's beautiful. It's about the most beautiful 
thing you could feel -- to hear yourself playing a perfect note." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Toledano doesn't sing or dance or play the piano. He just talks like a 
college debate team leader twice his 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Politics are Michael's passion. "I'm a heavy Democrat," the Costa Mesa boy 
declared. "Since the time I've been alive, Republicans have been in the White 
House. In 1986 (at the sophisticated age of 7) I started seeing the way they 
handle things, and I don't like it. They're taking money that could help the 
homeless and using it to kill people more efficiently with the Stealth Bomber. 
I'm worried about the expansion of nuclear weapons that's been going on since 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also worried about the San Francisco earthquake, but that's one thing I 
can't blame on the Republicans," he wryly added. 
</P>
<P>
Michael intends to run for president someday, after first winning the Nobel 
Prize for finding an AIDS cure. "AIDS interferes with (a victim's) ability to 
fight off diseases," he noted. "It's like in chess -- if the other guy hasn't 
lost any pieces and you only have a king, you've got no hope of defending 
yourself against an attack." 
</P>
<P>
As one might deduce from his analogy, Michael is a chess lover. And, as one 
might deduce from his conversational skills, Michael is extremely bright. 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant children might shine among the masses, but they have their own set of 
problems. For one thing, they are bored quickly. Until this year, when he 
started at Pegasus, a Huntington Beach school for gifted children, Michael 
attended public school -- where he often languished in ennui. 
</P>
<P>
He posed a rhetorical question: "I'm sitting in class and the teachers are 
talking about something that I learned three years ago and, I mean, am I 
supposed to enjoy it?" 
</P>
<P>
"The public school system is not equipped to accommodate a child like Michael," 
said the youngster's father, attorney Jim Toledano. "He is as far from the 
median as a child with an IQ of 40. These (gifted) kids require as much 
individual attention as handicapped children." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Call agreed: "Intellectual precocity should be addressed in the 
same way that you would address a serious hearing problem. Schools are 
organized to teach groups of children, not individual children -- yet 
individual help is required in the case of a child with unusual gifts, same as 
in the case of a handicapped child." 
</P>
<P>
Private school, however, is not a viable option for all -- either financially 
or logistically. Laguna Beach parents Mr. and Mrs. L., who requested anonymity, 
keep their son Eric in public school regardless of the shortcomings that they 
see in it. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't spend all day driving him back and forth across the county to a 
private school," said Mrs. L., a college teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the math books we're using right now are very low-level," complained 
9-year-old Eric, whose IQ tested at 179. "We're going over stuff like 
subtraction and borrowing. That's old hat, believe me."

Tax attorney Edward Lindsay and wife June have decided that daughter Jennifer 
is much in need of a one-on-one education and that they would rather do it 
themselves. Jennifer attends Courreges Elementary School in Fountain Valley 
only a few hours a week. The rest of the time, her living room is her classroom 
and her mother is her instructor. "Jennifer has become my full-time job," said 
June Lindsay, formerly a public school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Currently Jennifer is studying such unelementary subjects as Leonardo da Vinci. 
"I have a copy of 'Mona Lisa' hanging over my bed, but I'd rather have the real 
thing," she announced. 
</P>
<P>
So your child isn't a Wunderkind? You can take solace in the fact that genius 
has its price. The child who can bring home a boast-worthy report card without 
cracking a book encounters as many potholes in life's road as do more "normal" 
darlings. 
</P>
<P>
Often he doesn't bring home a boast-worthy report card, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
"A very common problem with these children is that they don't do their 
homework, they don't perform," Call said. "Things comes so easily to them that 
they lose interest. They look at the world more abstractly; they get caught up 
in their own agenda rather than the school curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
Whiz kids don't always adapt well to their surroundings. "They are different, 
and our societal attitude is not accepting of the unconventional," Call said. 
"Other children aren't receptive to a child who is unusual in any way, so he 
can have a hard time making friends. Sometimes classmates call him derogatory 
names -- nerd, egghead. Many precocious youngsters do not find true friendships 
until graduate school, where they run into a significant number of others like 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"Michael came home from his first day of school at Pegasus and said, 'Finally, 
I'm not different anymore, Mom -- I'm average,' " Peggy Toledano remembered. 
Cute, amiable Michael had felt estranged? "He's aware when he doesn't fit in," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although witty, gregarious Eric L. has scant trouble garnering pals, he seldom 
discusses his main interest -- astronomy -- while romping in the back yard. "He 
holds himself back from revealing his intelligence when he's with youngsters 
his own age. He wants to be socially acceptable. That's why he wears his hair 
in that crew cut -- it's in," laughed his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of the class weirdo," Eric bluntly confessed with his 
self-deprecating humor. An adept Jackie Mason impersonator, he's also the class 
comedian. "My mother has this weird philosophy that someday girls are going to 
chase me. Ha," he skeptically related. Time likely will prove her right. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Cheng views herself as "an individualist." "I'm usually at home alone, 
practicing piano or reading. If I focused a lot of my mind on my friends, I 
might not play the piano as well," she speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Stretches of solitude are important for a creative child, reminded Laura Katz 
Hathaway, founder and director of Pegasus School. "The great artists and 
scientists of the world were not sitting in a structured classroom when they 
arrived at their ideas," she said. "They were walking through the woods or 
sitting on the front porch. The brain needs a chance to gestate and digest 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our kids are overscheduled. They go home after a full day of school, 
and then they have piano lessons one day, gymnastics the next, soccer the next. 
These kids don't have time to breathe; they don't have time to just daydream 
and mess around. When they're out at recess and there's nothing programmed, 
many of them have a hard time figuring out how to entertain themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can understand how parents end up overscheduling their children," 
Hathaway conceded. "Gifted children often are very high-energy. They're always 
wanting to do something. They can drive you crazy if you don't keep them busy." 
</P>
<P>
Violin lessons, voice lessons, chess lessons, ballet lessons -- being 
multitalented can kill your whole day. "I wish I had more time to play," 
Jennifer Lindsay groused. 
</P>
<P>
In case you're still consoling yourself with the drawbacks of superior 
intelligence, register this: The parents of a brainy child face a tough 
18-year-plus responsibility. Among other trying characteristics, little 
geniuses won't take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
After his mother had ordered him to quit roller skating in the house, Michael 
dropped to his knees and hobbled; after all, simply removing the forbidden 
wheels would have presented no challenge whatsoever. "He'll calculate a way 
around every rule," Peggy Toledano sighed, exasperated. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to debate every point with him," said Eric's L's dad, an engineer. 
"You practically have to act like an attorney to convince him of his 
boundaries. His response is always, 'Why not? Why not? Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, little geniuses file information like tape recorders -- faulty 
data included. 
</P>
<P>
"If they learn something that's incorrect, it's hard to erase from their 
memory," said Glory Ludwick, founder of the Orange-based El Dorado School for 
gifted children. "They have a tendency to become very rigid in their thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Take Michael, the hard-core Democrat. "He sees the two parties in black and 
white," chuckled Jim Toledano. "He has the mind of an 18-year-old but the 
maturity of a 10-year-old. We're hoping that someday he'll see the shades of 
gray, as well -- that he'll understand Republicans aren't evil incarnate." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and perhaps most important, the parents of little geniuses must give 
their children room to be themselves -- as must all parents. 
</P>
<P>
"With the best of intentions, parents can use a gifted child to meet 
expectations they weren't able to meet in their own lives," said psychologist 
James Daehnert, director of the Child Therapy Center of Orange. "The child can 
develop a false self, where he feels that he must put on a good performance in 
order to be accepted and loved." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes parents push gifted kids too hard," Ludwick of El Dorado School 
observed. "Kids grow up fast enough. We should allow our children to be 
children. There is plenty of time for adulthood, but you can never go back and 
relive a year of childhood."

LIFE AND DEATH DRAMAS IN TRANQUIL NEWPORT SHORES

<P>
While other parts of Newport Beach are typified by ease and elegance, many 
life-and-death dramas take place each day at Hoag Hospital, the dominant 
landmark of the Newport Shores-Newport Crest neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day at the 471-bed facility, located on a bluff overlooking 
Newport Harbor, an average of seven babies are born and at least 100 people 
receive emergency treatment. The Hoag Chemical Dependency Center is here, along 
with centers specializing in the treatment of heart disease and infertility. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has functioned in a state of constant change and expansion since 
it opened as a 75-bed facility on the site in 1952. The most recent addition, 
the George and Patty Hoag Cancer Center, is under construction and scheduled 
for completion next year on a portion of a 22-acre adjacent site purchased in 
1984. Dubby Evins, president of facilities design, says plans for that acreage 
will triple the size of the hospital during the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag Hospital functions as the main hub of the non-residential portion of the 
Newport Shores-Newport Crest area, coexisting with numerous professional 
buildings and other large businesses such as the Hughes Aircraft Newport Beach 
facility on 16th Street, just south of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Several large condominium developments are on the bluff west of the hospital, 
including Newport Crest. But the portion of the neighborhood along West Coast 
Highway below the hospital is more typical of the relaxed, waterfront 
atmosphere associated with other portions of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical weekday morning, rush-hour traffic streams along West Coast 
Highway while a number of cars pull into Cappy's Cafe -- as though lured by the 
smell of breakfast sausage and ham steaks frying on the grill. The aroma drifts 
out the door toward the parking lot as customers pile out of their cars and 
head in for a leisurely breakfast with friends or alone with the newspaper. The 
restaurant is a favorite among locals and others in the know. 
</P>
<P>
T.K. Brimer, who owns the Frog House surf shop nearby, sleeps too late to be 
part of the breakfast crowd at Cappy's, however. Brimer's employees open the 
shop every morning at 9, usually after testing the early morning surf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a night person," Brimer says. "I don't get in to work until around 9:30 or 
10, and if the surf's good, I head right out and surf for an hour or two. The 
only reason I have this shop is so I can surf. It's no big moneymaker." 
</P>
<P>
The big moneymaker in the neighborhood is the city-owned oil field behind Frog 
House, on marshland near the Santa Ana River. The 16 pumps churn out an average 
of 60,000 barrels of oil per year from ocean-floor wells one to two miles 
offshore. The wells provided more than $500,000 in revenue for the city last 
year. And when the price of oil is higher, revenue from the wells hits the 
million-dollar mark, according to Newport Beach utilities director Robert J. 
Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
The oil field is across a canal from a residential area where Howard and Betty 
Jo Chace have lived since 1963, when they purchased their canal-front home new 
for $38,000 on land leased from Signal Landmark Corp. Fortunately for them, the 
Chaces were among those who decided to buy the property their home is built on 
for an additional $38,000 when Signal Landmark made the land available for 
purchase in 1976. Only 76 of the original 398 homeowners decided to purchase 
then. 
</P>
<P>
When Signal Landmark offered the property for sale again in 1982, the asking 
price had nearly doubled, resulting in numerous lawsuits that are now reaching 
the settlement stage. "People were shocked at the increase," Howard Chace said. 
"I wouldn't take less than $500,000 for this home now." 
</P>
<P>
Although the neighborhood was originally a tract-home development, some owners, 
like the Chaces, have added their own embellishments to the street and 
canal-front portions of their homes, giving many of the houses a unique look, 
in spite of uniformity in size. The slow-moving canal frequented by egrets and 
other sea birds gives the area a peaceful atmosphere distinct from other, 
faster-paced portions of Newport Shores-Newport Crest.

SOARING FOOD COSTS PUSH UP PRICE INDEX; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: OCTOBER PRICES ARE SURPRISINGLY HIGH, BUT ANALYSTS PREDICT A BREAK IN 
INFLATION IN MONTHS AHEAD.

<P>
Wholesale prices, pushed up by the steepest increase in food costs in 22 
months, rose 0.4% in October, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the Labor Department's producer price index was markedly 
smaller than the 0.9% jump in September but was still surprisingly high to many 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
The September and October advances followed rare monthly declines in July and 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have been on a roller coaster this year, first surging ahead and then 
easing during the summer after food and energy costs moderated. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of the year, wholesale prices have been rising at an 
annual rate of 5.2%, compared with an increase of 4% for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Food costs rose a steep 1.4% in October, following declines in three of the 
four previous months. Analysts said the jump in food costs reflected in part 
bad weather that affected California and Florida vegetable crops. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetable prices shot up 18.9%. Other big advances in the food category were a 
9.5% increase in pork costs, a 5.6% rise in fish prices and a 4.9% increase for 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The overall 1.4% advance in food costs was the biggest advance since a 1.5% 
rise in January, 1988. But analysts said the one-month increase in the volatile 
food category was not alarming given the fact that food costs had been falling. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said they continue to believe that slower economic growth will 
translate into lower inflationary pressures in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable, we expect 
further moderation in prices in 1990," said Stacy Kottman, assistant director 
of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
Energy costs, which had been the driving force behind the September spurt in 
the overall index, moderated in October to a slight 0.2% increase, far below 
the 6.5% surge in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices were up 2.3% after a 10.6% jump in September. The cost of 
natural gas dropped by 2.5% while home heating prices fell by 0.5% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices excluding energy and food costs were up a tiny 0.1% in 
October. Many analysts consider this figure a better gauge of underlying 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
New-car prices fell by 1.4% in October at the start of the new model year.

SCHOOL-BY-SCHOOL CAP TEST RESULTS FOR THE SOUTH BAY; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 100 
and more than 400, and may be compared to district and state averages. For 
example, if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state 
average is 278, children at your school are performing at a higher level than 
most third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The state has eliminated the written expression portion of its eighth-grade 
multiple choice test and replaced it with an essay test. The results of the 
essay test will be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
Dashes indicate that tests were not given or that scores were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Sample Question 
</P>
<P>
Illustrative social studies passage: 
</P>
<P>
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new 
plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail 
service to California -- the pony express, which would deliver the mail in ten 
days or less. 
</P>
<P>
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. 
These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They 
had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. 
You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go 
through!" And it did go through! 
</P>
<P>
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or 
mochila. In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars 
was the usual price for sending a letter. 
</P>
<P>
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode 
nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used 
were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was 
thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were 
saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the 
saddle -- and off like the wind! 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative test questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Which of the following is an example of an opinion? 
</P>
<P>
 -- "In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting 
new plan..." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The mail must go through." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Each rider rode nonstop for about a hundred miles." 
</P>
<P>
If you had lived in Missouri in 1855 and had posted a letter to Sacramento, you 
can tell that it would have taken: 
</P>
<P>
 -- longer than 10 days 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10 days 
</P>
<P>
 -- five days 
</P>
<P>
 -- less than nine days 
</P>
<P>
STATEWIDE AVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students 
in elementary schools.

SCHOOL-BY-SCHOOL RESULTS FOR THIRD, SIXTH, EIGHTH GRADES;

<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 100 
and more than 400, and may be compared to district and state averages. For 
example, if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state 
average is 278, children at your school are performing at a higher level than 
most third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The state has eliminated the written expression portion of its eighth-grade 
multiple choice test and replaced it with an essay test. The results of the 
essay test will be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
Dashes indicate that tests were not given or that scores were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Sample Question 
</P>
<P>
Illustrative social studies passage: 
</P>
<P>
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new 
plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail 
service to California -- the pony express, which would deliver the mail in ten 
days or less. 
</P>
<P>
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. 
These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They 
had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. 
You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go 
through!" And it did go through! 
</P>
<P>
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or 
mochila. In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars 
was the usual price for sending a letter. 
</P>
<P>
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode 
nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used 
were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was 
thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were 
saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the 
saddle -- and off like the wind! 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative test questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Which of the following is an example of an opinion? 
</P>
<P>
 -- "In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting 
new plan..." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The mail must go through." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Each rider rode nonstop for about a hundred miles." 
</P>
<P>
If you had lived in Missouri in 1855 and had posted a letter to Sacramento, you 
can tell that it would have taken: 
</P>
<P>
 -- longer than 10 days 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10 days 
</P>
<P>
 -- five days 
</P>
<P>
 -- less than nine days 
</P>
<P>
STATEWIDE AVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students 
in elementary schools.
