HOT WINDS FAN FIRES, BEACH-GOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It's November in Southern California. Yet fall was nowhere in evidence Friday 
as desert winds fanned four brush fires, including one that threatened a movie 
star's home, and temperatures soared over 90 degrees, sending surfers and other 
sun worshipers scurrying to the beaches to soak up the summer-like rays. 
</P>
<P>
From the air, plumes of smoke could be seen rising from all directions as 
blazes raged in Pacific Palisades, Chatsworth, Diamond Bar and the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the flames did little to discourage beach-goers who hit the sands in 
unusually high numbers, thanks largely to the fact that many businesses were 
closed for Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where beach crowds were also above average, the official high 
temperature Friday was 82 recorded at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters don't see the warm weather continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a weakening of the high pressure zone that in turn will give 
us a little bit cooler temperatures over the weekend and a return of patchy low 
clouds and fog, particularly on Saturday night," forecaster Frank Perdue said. 
"Other than that, it's a very unexciting weather pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Today's high at San Diego beaches should be from 69 to 74 degrees. Sunday is 
expected to be even cooler, with a high temperature of 66 to 71. The ocean 
temperature will be near 61. 
</P>
<P>
Perdue said that the weakened high-pressure system will continue to keep stormy 
weather to the north. That's lucky, he said, because there will be tides of 
over seven feet in the next few days and when storms accompany such high tides 
they often cause damage along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"If you got a storm surge it could be pretty hairy," Perdue said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, lifeguard Randy DeGregori said smoke from the Pacific 
Palisades fire wafted over Santa Monica Beach like dark clouds but did not 
attract much attention. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong breeze, so a lot of the smoke is coming right down on us," 
DeGregori said. "But people are having a pretty good time." 
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving brush fire that swept across 90 canyon acres in Pacific 
Palisades was the worst result of the hot, dry and windy weather attributed to 
a mild Santa Ana condition. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was controlled after about two hours, started in the 900 block 
of Palisades Drive and raced up a canyon wall toward residential areas. 
Twenty-nine firefighting companies battled the blaze, aided by helicopters that 
dropped thousands of gallons of water over the burning brush. Residents also 
aided firefighters by hosing down their multimillion-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
Among those whose property was threatened by the fire was actor Chevy Chase, 
who lives in the Pacific Highlands. Smoke-belching flames edged within 100 
yards of estate-sized houses. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Brodia was walking out of a market when she first noticed the blaze. She 
raced toward her home on Avenida de Cortez and quickly gathered up her husband 
and 14-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just drove out right through the fire," Brodia said. "The flames were all up 
on one side of the road, and it was hot as hell and very scary. But at least my 
baby is safe." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rockwell, who lives at the end of the Calle de Sevilla cul-de-sac, had left 
his house for his usual morning jog minutes before the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out the door, and it was a bright clear day," said Rockwell, who was 
standing in front of his house still clad in running shorts. "Halfway through 
my run I saw the smoke and thought, 'Oh my God!' By the time I got back the 
fire was pretty much under control." 
</P>
<P>
George Bodner watched nervously from his home at the end of Cumbre Alta Court 
as the flames roared to within a few feet of his back-yard swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely lucky," he said. "I happened to look out of the back of the 
house and the fire was coming straight toward us, and then suddenly the wind 
shifted and took it the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Bodner and his neighbors kept watch for most of the afternoon as four 
helicopters shuttled from nearby Santa Ynez Reservoir, dumping water into the 
burning canyon beneath their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents anxiously gathered at a roadblock set up at Sunset Boulevard 
and Palisades Drive, all too wary of the awesome destructive powers of 
uncontainable brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said the blaze, the cause of 
which was unknown, could have been a lot worse if it were not for good brush 
clearance, a quick response and a "lot of luck." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago these homes would have burned down," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. "But we have avoided a 
disaster. We have just done a good job of prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Much the same could be said of the other brush fires that cut paths across the 
Southland as temperatures topped the 90-degree mark in some areas and winds 
gusted as high as 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Diamond Bar brush fire backed up traffic for several miles on both sides of 
the Pomona Freeway and came as close as 50 feet to a housing tract Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out on a hill north of the Pomona Freeway, causing a SigAlert 
at 12:30 p.m. as motorists slowed to view the fire. The flames were contained 
by 3 p.m. but not before the fire spread farther north over the hill, 
threatening homes in the Samarran Oaks housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
Five county fire crews, made up in large part of inmates from Azusa and La 
Verne correctional facilities, fought the flames, which leaped 60 feet in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up the street and saw it right in my back yard," said Elaine Gonzalez, 
a Samarran Oaks townhouse resident. "My heart ran to my throat." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were also fearful of a fast-moving brush fire that broke out in a 
remote northwest Antelope Valley area known as Kings Canyon. But structures 
escaped the blaze, which charred 60 acres of brush, the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 12:45 p.m. and was contained by 5 p.m. No evacuations 
were ordered although two residents fled their houses as flames approached.

<P>
Twila G. Reid, a pioneer educator for whom an Anaheim school, park and library 
are named, has died in a Newport Beach hospital at the age of 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona del Mar resident died Thursday of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
The first woman school district superintendent in California, she worked for 37 
years in the Savanna Elementary School District in Orange County as a teacher, 
principal and superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"I taught some of your brothers and sisters and I know many of your parents. 
I'm so happy and proud to be here," she told children from the Twila Reid 
School attending a 1973 groundbreaking ceremony for the 25-acre Twila Reid 
Community Park. "I call it my park and my school." 
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 4, 1895, in Gleeten Hill, Pa. -- which was named after a family 
member -- Twila Gleeten got her own elementary education in a one-room country 
school. She later graduated from Edinboro University in Edinboro, Pa., and in 
1917 married Paul G. Reid, who is now deceased, and moved to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A dedicated citizen as well as educator, she was proud of voting in every 
public election after women were given the vote by the 19th Amendment. After 
her retirement in 1962, she served for many years as a polling place official. 
</P>
<P>
She taught one year at the elementary school named in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her son, Richard T. Reid of Whittier, daughter Eileene La 
Barthe of Corona del Mar, two sisters and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services and interment will be at 11 a.m. Monday at Pacific View Memorial Park, 
3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the Reid School 
Library Memorial Fund, 720 S. Western Ave., Anaheim.

FAMILY DREAM OF PRESERVING A SLICE OF ESCONDIDO HISTORY DIES WITH PROPERTY SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Beven Ryan, who has lived all of her 88 years in Escondido, decided 
about 17 years ago that she wanted to preserve a little bit of "the way it was" 
for generations yet to be. 
</P>
<P>
So she and her late husband, artist Lewis Ryan, deeded their 15 acres of 
unspoiled property -- with its towering Engelmann oaks and rocky hillsides -- 
to the University of California, her alma mater, as a nature reserve. Or so 
they thought. 
</P>
<P>
The couple reserved the right to live out their lives on the property in a tiny 
cottage that had been built by Frances' father, Albert Beven, in l9l8. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a grand day, that day of the dedication," Ryan recalled, bringing out 
her scrapbooks. "People came from all over." Indeed, many of the town's 
founding families, local politicians, even a University of California dignitary 
or two from Berkeley. There were speeches and dedication of a handsome bronze 
plaque: 
</P>
<P>
 University of California Natural Land and Water Reserves System. Ryan Oak Glen 
Reserve. Dedicated April 26, l975. In Recognition of the Generosity Of Frances 
and Lewis Ryan And the Fulfillment Of Their Lifelong Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But that happy day also contained "our first inkling that things might not be 
as they seemed," Ryan said. One of the university speakers told the assemblage 
of about 200, "We take reserve land any way we can get it, and we take money, 
too," Ryan recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The inkling became a certainty last year when the Ryans' land was removed from 
the UC natural reserve system and sold, despite a clause in the gift deed 
restricting disposal of the property until the Ryans' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners already have begun to clear part of the land for construction of 
an antique automobile museum. 
</P>
<P>
To Frances Beven Ryan, a teacher, writer and world traveler who has championed 
far-flung causes, from saving Central American rain forests to building a 
church in India, the hometown project was closest to her heart. With its loss, 
she vowed to return or disavow more than 160 honors and plaques she had 
received in recognition of her 15 years as caretaker of the little preserve. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryans searched long before turning over their rural acreage about 4 miles 
northeast of Escondido's business district to the University of California 
Board of Regents. They went first to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, 
who were reluctant to accept the property and maintain it as a natural park. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they just didn't have the money to take on the maintenance of 
another park," she said, "and, without that, the place would be filled with 
beer cans and banana peels." 
</P>
<P>
The couple tried the Nature Conservancy and were told that their land had 
"great potential" but that the state agency only acquires land to turn it over 
to some other group to manage. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryans also went to nearby Palomar College. Administrators there thought a 
nature preserve of rare native plants was a good idea but said that, as a new 
junior college, they lacked the funds to take on the task of creating one. 
</P>
<P>
So, when they heard of the university's reserve program, Ryan said, "it seemed 
too perfect to be true." Now she says it was. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 29, l987, she learned that the University of California Natural Reserve 
System was selling the Ryan Oak Glen Reserve to Billy D. and Ethel Norman of 
Escondido for $80,000, with the proviso that the property not be disturbed 
except for the construction of a residence, associated outbuildings and a 
museum to display vintage automobiles and related memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Ryan, whose husband had died five years earlier, was allowed under the 
terms of the sale to remain in her cottage for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose they needed the money," she said of the university's unexpected 
move. "I think that's what they were thinking of -- the money -- all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Frances Ryan had decided not to bequeath her share of the family's 
land to her four brothers and sisters for fear that, "in a generation or two or 
three, they would decide to rent it out or sell it." 
</P>
<P>
So she gave it to the university because, "if you can't trust your own alma 
mater, whom can you trust?" 
</P>
<P>
Now she says of her decision, "It was the most colossal mistake of my life, a 
nightmarish shattering of life's dream." 
</P>
<P>
In her initial anger, Ryan walked to the entrance of the reserve, where a 
redwood plaque donated by Escondido community groups proclaimed the "Ryan Oak 
Glen Reserve." She painted out the "Ryan." And next to a massive rock where the 
handsome bronze dedication plaque is affixed, she erected a cross bearing the 
inscription, "R.I.P. -- ROGR" to mark the passing of the Ryan Oak Glen Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Samuelsen, director of the UC reserve system, sighed as he recalled the 
day he told Frances Ryan that the preserve would be sold. He said that he 
assured her that the sale would not mar her dream of preserving the rare 
Engelmann oak that shades her cottage with its massive canopy, or of preserving 
a bit of Escondido the way it was when the Indians lived beneath the same 
sheltering branches. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to dispose of the Escondido reserve was done "after considerable 
evaluation" by an advisory committee, Samuelsen said. The Ryan property was too 
distant from the students studying botany (the UC San Diego campus has no 
botany department), and too small to make it valuable for teaching and 
research, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Samuelsen said, was that the preserve "was not viable to hold 
in the name of the university." 
</P>
<P>
The sale to the Normans was a compromise aimed at preserving most of the 
property in its natural state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Norman is Frances Ryan's second cousin, and the Normans agreed that only 
a small portion of the property would be developed, Samuelsen explained. 
Because of these restrictions, the land, valued at $160,000, was sold for half 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Ryan made overtures to buy the land back when she learned it was to be 
sold, Samuelsen said, "but we felt that it would be unwise for a widow lady to 
be dipping into her estate. Fortunately, the Normans came forward, and we felt 
that this would be a better way to go." 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked him (Samuelsen) to name a price, he wouldn't do it," Ryan said. 
"He asked me what I wanted to do with the property, and I told him that it was 
none of his business, just name the price. But he wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said she has no quarrel with the Normans. 
</P>
<P>
"They are real nice people and they have been very nice to me," she said. But 
she doesn't glance at the reddish scar by the preserve entrance where the 
vegetation has been stripped in preparation for a building pad. 
</P>
<P>
She still chafes at the mistake she believes she made in deeding the land to 
her alma mater, and she has considered bringing suit. The deed of gift 
agreement she made in 1973 allowed for the sale of the estate "if circumstances 
no longer permit beneficial use of said property," but said that right could be 
exercised only "after termination of our life interests." 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm still alive, whether they care to believe it or not," she said, 
adding, "but, by the time I sued and won, I'd likely be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her strong Escondido roots, Ryan's interests have taken her around the 
world more than once. She graduated at the top of her class from the University 
of California, Southern Branch (now UCLA), was named a Phi Beta Kappa while 
earning her master's degree at USC, received a Fulbright scholarship, taught 
home economics for 30 years, wrote five books on Escondido history, and, now 
that her 15 years as caretaker of the preserve have ended, has launched into 
new endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
She also donated funds to buy and preserve rain forests in Costa Rica, then 
traveled there to be sure the money was well-spent. She endowed a church in 
Madras, India, a place where she once watched as hordes of beggars lined the 
road, waiting for the rich to ride by on elephants and toss them alms. 
</P>
<P>
But she believes that she has not yet accomplished her goal of leaving 
something of worth in Escondido to document the early days of its history. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the preserve is gone, I've decided that I just have to find something 
else," she said. The "something else" is to be a place to keep more than 100 
years' worth of mementos. 
</P>
<P>
There ought to be a place for "treasures of the past," Ryan said, a pioneer 
room where they can be displayed for future generations. She is raising money 
and support for just such a place. Perhaps it will be situated at the Escondido 
city library or at a branch yet to be built in the Orange Glen area where her 
ancestors settled. 
</P>
<P>
But, if her dream does not come to pass before she dies, Ryan is firm in her 
resolve that her family heirlooms be destroyed, "not turned over to some 
antique dealer who would make a lot of money on them." 
</P>
<P>
"My family was one of the founding families here, and I want a place for my 
history after I'm gone," she explained. "Otherwise, I want them to burn all 
these things I've collected in my lifetime."

EL CORTEZ HAS INSIDE TRACK AS NEW COURTS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former El Cortez Hotel Convention Center sits high on a steep hill at Beech 
Street and 8th Avenue, an appendage of the landmark, but vacant, high-rise 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Seven blocks downhill, at 5th Avenue and Broadway, is the equally empty 8-story 
Walker-Scott department store, which in its quest for tenants bills itself as 
having "classic sophistication at a landmark address." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few activities at the El Cortez these days is professional boxing. 
Matches occur irregularly. Things are even slower down at the department store, 
where an indoor version of a swap meet wilted and died from a lack of 
customers. Now, the bench facing the big display windows on 5th provides 
derelicts a respite and the scent of urine has returned. 
</P>
<P>
The two landmarks, such as they are, are pitted against each other for the 
"temporary" site of nine new civil Superior Courts scheduled for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has agreed to provide $3 million in redevelopment funds 
for courtroom construction, and the staff of Centre City Development Corp., the 
agency responsible for administering those funds, wants the courtrooms in the 
department store. Rehabilitation of the Walker-Scott store, the CCDC contends, 
would do more to further overall downtown revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, CCDC staff submitted a report calling on its board of 
directors to approve a resolution urging county supervisors to select the old 
department store. On Nov. 3, CCDC's board of directors put off a decision until 
this Friday to allow El Cortez representatives a chance to discuss the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff in charge of evaluating the competing sites says the El Cortez 
has met all the basic requirements -- as did the Walker-Scott building. More 
important, the El Cortez can provide the courtrooms more cheaply, though the 
dollars involved are being kept secret because negotiations are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Unless those negotiations hit a snag, though, the county staff will formally 
recommend the El Cortez site to the Board of Supervisors, perhaps as early as 
next month. And, in the end, it's the county staff's recommendation that 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The judges, who established minimum selection criteria such as 12-foot ceilings 
and 30- by 35-foot courtrooms to accommodate large exhibits presented at civil 
trials, are officially on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Wayne L. Peterson, chairman of the Superior Court master 
plan committee, said that, once judges were assured that the court's space 
criteria could be met, then it became "a dollars and cents issue" left to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"We understood the county's position that it didn't want the judiciary involved 
in the negotiations. . . . It boils down to the economics," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Maxwell, the county's deputy director of real property, said the county 
asked for bids early this year and it received more than a dozen responses. As 
the county whittled the list, El Cortez emerged as the best candidate to 
provide the required minimum 60,000 square feet because of cost. 
</P>
<P>
He and the county are negotiating the final details with Grosvenor Industries 
and Minami Group, owners of the El Cortez. Just last month, the owners 
announced plans to renovate the historic hotel and use it as a centerpiece for 
a $250-million residential and commercial project, a plan that includes the 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Both the owners of the 63-year-old El Cortez and the 54-year-old Walker-Scott 
building, O'Hill Partners, submitted their best and final offers. After those 
offers were evaluated, the county entered into exclusive negotiations with the 
El Cortez owners. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment officials have no quarrel with the process the county 
has used. But, given that both buildings meet the minimum space criteria, they 
believe use of the old department store, which closed in February, 1985, would 
have a greater impact on redeveloping Center City than the outlying El Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Hamilton, executive director of the agency, said her agency's stance is 
based solely on the issue of which surroundings would benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
The El Cortez area is primarily residential, and the agency is trying to 
attract residents to the downtown. Hamilton fears that courtrooms on the hill 
will place pressure on the neighborhood to transform residential buildings into 
offices for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the county spent $7 million to buy and renovate a 6th Avenue 
building one block from the El Cortez and turn it into the Family Court 
Building, where all domestic law and probates cases are now handled. 
</P>
<P>
In Hamilton's view, both the Walker-Scott building and the area around it are 
badly in need of a boost. The store is across the street from the historic 
Gaslamp Quarter, an area rich in what bureaucrats call "inappropriate uses" 
such as adult book stores, and abounding in vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
"Courts would be ideal for that location," Hamilton said, noting the department 
store building is next to Horton Plaza, restaurants and public transportation, 
including the trolley and Broadway bus corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"The location of courtrooms at 5th and Broadway supports the Centre City 
Community Plan by keeping the facilities in close proximity to other similar 
public uses," says CCDC's staff report, calling El Cortez merely adequate. 
</P>

"The Centre City Community Plan calls for a dense urban core and activity mode. 
The nine courts at 5th and Broadway would contribute to this goal," according 
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell said he wasn't aware of the CCDC staff position and "my only response 
is that it's rather late in the process." He emphasized that El Cortez was 
picked through competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever site is picked by the board of supervisors, the so-called temporary 
courtrooms will be in place for quite a while. Although the county is 
negotiating a five-year deal, Peterson said that "realistically speaking" the 
temporary courtrooms will be used for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The space crunch is so bad that the county is now operating four Superior 
Courts in the San Diego Hotel. Under the expansion proposal under 
consideration, those courts would be closed and added to five new ones, for a 
total of nine. The additions would bring the number of Superior Courts downtown 
to more than 40. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, all the courts downtown will be consolidated again. And, if the 
judges have their way, that will occur in a rebuilt and expanded county 
courthouse building. But no one is certain when that will happen, though 
estimates range from seven to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the imprecision is that funding for new courtrooms was included 
in Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax increase approved by voters in June, 
1988, but which was declared unconstitutional by a Riverside County Superior 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the measure needed approval by two-thirds of those voting and 
not just a majority. The county is appealing the decision, a process that could 
take two years. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to raise $1.6 billion to pay for new courts and jails. 
Even if Proposition A were in effect, Peterson said, the nine new temporary 
courtrooms would still have to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be where we are right now with or without Proposition A" because the 
measure's funds, if available, would have gone first to build new jails.

ANIMAL PARK ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE OVERDUE PREGNANT ELEPHANT FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Wild Animal Park made a third but unsuccessful attempt on Friday 
to examine Jean the pregnant elephant, who is more than 60 days overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped to have seen the fetus," said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the 
park. "But we were unable to ascertain anything." 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Jean's keepers have been concerned that the fetus may be dead and 
that Jean may be developing an infection. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they began treating the 19-year-old elephant with hormones to help 
her begin dilating, as well as some antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Normal gestation for an elephant takes 615 to 668 days. As of Friday, Jean has 
been carrying the fetus about 730 days. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom has said that, if the elephant cannot give birth to the baby, a 
Cesarean section will be considered as the last, drastic option. 
</P>
<P>
"In large mammals, we always expect some small complications in a first 
pregnancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if she becomes infected from within, there will be very little we can do 
for her." 
</P>

POLICE BLANKET VALLEY IN DRUNK DRIVING SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 Los Angeles Police officers fanned out through the San Fernando 
Valley Friday night in the city's biggest drunk driving sweep ever, hoping to 
compel motorists to shy away from drinking and driving during the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to make the Valley as safe a place as possible during the holiday 
season," said Deputy Chief Ronald A. Frankel, commander of the LAPD's Valley 
Bureau. "We want people to spend their money on holiday gifts instead of 
hospital bills." 
</P>
<P>
The effort started at 6 p.m. and was expected to continue until 2:45 a.m. 
today. It will be repeated tonight and on unannounced occasions during the 
holiday season, Sgt. Dennis Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were optimistic Friday's task force would break the department's 
record of 171 suspected drunk drivers arrested in a single night's sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike past crackdowns, this weekend's sweep does not include sobriety 
checkpoints. Instead, motorists arrested on suspicion of drunk driving were 
being taken to an Immediate Booking and Release System installation outside the 
Police Department's Van Nuys station, where they were fingerprinted and tested 
for alcohol while waiting for sober friends or relatives to pick them up, Sgt. 
Mike Pattee said. 
</P>
<P>
The system includes two converted RTD buses -- one used as a holding tank and 
the other for testing for alcohol and running record checks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It allows officers to immediately return to the field after dropping off a 
drunk driving suspect, rather than spending the usual two hours booking the 
individual at a police station, Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
Zine said the operation is unique because it includes officers from all six 
Valley police divisions. Past drunk driving task forces were manned exclusively 
by traffic officers and usually did not exceed 20 officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a send-off for the holidays," Sgt. Jim Gicking said. "We're letting the 
public know what it's going to be like over the holidays. We're going to 
saturate the area." 
</P>
<P>
As of Nov. 4, 23 people had been killed in drunk driving accidents in the 
Valley, Zine said. That amounts to 23% of all fatal accidents in the area, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The toll is actually less than for the same period last year, thanks in part to 
stiffer sentences for repeat drunk drivers and better safe driving education, 
he said. The number of fatal and major injury accidents of all types in the 
Valley has decreased 16.1% over the same period last year, from 852 to 715, 
police statistics show. During that same period, drunk driving accidents 
decreased 14.4% from 1,575 to 1,348. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Freeman, co-president of the Los Angeles County chapter of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, welcomed the operation, saying such sweeps have proven 
effective in persuading would-be drunk drivers to stay home or seek a ride from 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"The publicity is a tremendous deterrent because the people that might drink 
and drive say 'I may not be able to get away with that,' " said Freeman, whose 
17-year-old daughter was killed by a drunk driver who plowed into the back of 
her disabled car three years ago.

MAILING GOOF SENDS COLLEGE SURVEY WAY OFF THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
That was the reaction of a mailing house paid to send nearly 10,000 letters and 
surveys from the College of the Canyons to households in the surrounding Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys were sent out as agreed. Unfortunately they went to addresses 45 
miles away in Newbury Park, next to Thousand Oaks, in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"They have never had a problem like this at all," said Nancy J. Mattice who, as 
the college's assistant dean for institutional development, had prepared the 
letter and surveys. The mailing house, which Mattice declined to identify, sent 
the mailings to the wrong ZIP code, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, there was a great deal of miscommunication," Mattice said with a 
slight laugh. "Isn't that an understatement?" 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Mattice wasn't laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The college had planned to survey 10% of the Santa Clarita Valley's households 
to learn how the college could better serve the community. The college sent 
4,800 letters to the households last week alerting residents to expect a survey 
in the mail this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 48,000 households in the Santa Clarita Valley, you are one of the 4,800 
to be selected to respond to the survey," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
After a Newbury Park resident who received a letter alerted Mattice to the 
problem Monday, she called the mailing house. A day later, she got the grim 
news. "I didn't have much of a sense of humor," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the surveys had just been delivered to the post office. 
Mattice tried to intercept them, but when she got to the post office, "there 
wasn't anybody at the bulk mail unit," she said. "They were all at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
When she called back after lunch, Mattice learned that neither rain, nor sleet 
nor botched mailing keep the U.S. Postal Service from its appointed rounds. The 
surveys were gone. "We have a very fine post office in Santa Clarita," she said 
with some irony. 
</P>
<P>
The mailing house is reprinting the letters and surveys and will pay for 
another mailing, said Mattice, who dismissed the error as a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Bozman, a college spokeswoman, pointed to the bright side to the fiasco: 
"It may get people looking forward to the survey."

COACH OF TAFT'S DECATHLON CHAMPS GOES OUT ON TOP; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE LOS ANGELES ACADEMIC DECATHLON WILL START NEXT SATURDAY WITHOUT 
ART BERCHIN, WHO LED THE TAFT HIGH TEAM TO THE '89 NATIONAL TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in recent memory, it's quiet after school in Art Berchin's 
neat classroom. Too quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft High School English teacher says he misses the noise and tension of 
the school's Academic Decathlon team, which for the past four years met there 
every day to study. 
</P>
<P>
Berchin, who as coach twice took the Taft team to the U.S. Academic Decathlon 
finals, quit the job weeks after winning the national title in April. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to duplicate the success of Berchin's Taft team, Academic Decathlon 
teams from schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District have 
already started last-minute cramming that will continue until the districtwide 
contest next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Berchin won't be there. 
</P>
<P>
"After four years, most people would assume that was enough," Berchin said this 
week. "And that's what I told everyone." 
</P>
<P>
However, Taft Principal Ron Berz maintains that Berchin quit after Berz refused 
a favor for one of Berchin's team members. "He was contemplating hanging it up 
anyway," Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever reason for Berchin's resignation, coaches of other high school 
decathlon teams say it will be tough for Taft, which has all new team members, 
to repeat last year's feat without him. The district's Academic Decathlon 
contest is the first step toward the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's new coach, humanities teacher Michael Wilson, refuses to predict whether 
the team will win the city championship but said, "I know we will do well." 
Wilson, who holds a master's degree in English literature, said the team has 
been studying at least five hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting in as much time as any previous Taft team," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Teams figuring to battle with Taft for the city title include El Camino Real 
High School in Woodland Hills, which finished second to Taft last year, and 
Westside's University High School. 
</P>
<P>
The academic contest, which tests students in 10 categories, including subjects 
such as mathematics, science and history, has earned national attention in 
recent years. Taft team members appeared with Johnny Carson on "The Tonight 
Show" this spring after their victory. 
</P>
<P>
Under contest rules, the nine-member teams are made up of three A-average 
students, three B-average students and three C-average students. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going because it would be too painful to sit in the audience," Berchin 
said. "The pain is not being in the action. Someone who coaches a decathlon 
must love competition. Otherwise, they wouldn't be in it. I miss proving that I 
can put together the best team." 
</P>
<P>
Berchin said the disagreement with the principal was only part of the reason 
for his quitting but declined to say more about the incident. Berz said Berchin 
asked that one of his team members be allowed to deliver a speech at the Taft 
graduation although the boy missed the deadline to try out for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought over the request, and I didn't think it was the right thing to do," 
Berz said. "But we have no hard feelings. I have the highest regard for him." 
</P>
<P>
Berchin took the same path as former Marshall High School Academic Decathlon 
coach David Tokofsky, who quit after winning the national championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Tokofsky, who knows Berchin as a competitor and a colleague, said the long 
hours from summer to spring that are required to win the national championship 
probably discouraged Berchin from trying for a second national title. 
</P>
<P>
Berchin endured the demands of the Academic Decathlon long enough to finish 
what he set out to do when he took over the Taft team, Tokofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year he brought the team into battle position, taking third in the 
district," Tokofsky said. "Then they had a score that would have won it, except 
we got an unbelievable score and go on to win nationals. Then the third year he 
wins city, state and goes to nationals, where he loses first place by just the 
essay section. If you're possessed about it, you can't quite leave it there." 
</P>
<P>
Berchin didn't. The Encino man, who gave up a career as an UCLA administrator 
in 1985 to teach high school students, started working with his new team 
immediately after Taft's 1988 national finals defeat by the team from J.J. 
Pearce High School of Richardson, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Berchin set forth his team philosophy: "Winning is everything." 
Nine months later, Taft won the city championship, defeated Beverly Hills High 
School for the state title and beat 38 other schools, including second-place 
Deer Park High School, of Deer Park, Tex., to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"When you let go of something like that, it leaves a vacuum," Berchin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the summer, I was getting withdrawal pains. But now I think it was the 
right thing to do. It was a hell of a lot of work, and it's time that someone 
else has an opportunity to try it."

10 YEARS WITH MAX ENDS THE WAY IT STARTED -- OUTSIDE, UNDER THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the pup's first night away from his mother, and he cried. So I sneaked 
out of a nice warm bed, leaving my wife asleep, and slept outside with the 
tiny, black, quivering dog. He curled up against my shoulder, and neither of us 
woke until the morning light. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, I once again slept outside with Max. And again, he rested 
his head against my shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years had passed between these doggie slumber parties. 
</P>
<P>
I now live in a different town. Own a different house. And, now that I think of 
it, have a different wife. 
</P>
<P>
And the dog that had on that first chilly night in San Pedro been roughly the 
size of a football was now roughly the size of a football field. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. There was another difference. On that first night, Max and I were spending 
our first moments together. Friday night was our last. On Saturday he died, 
silenced by a quick injection that ended a few weeks of pain he had endured 
with a cancerous tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Max was a half-Labrador, half-Doberman mutt who grew into 125 pounds of 
fearful-looking beast, the kind of dog you'd just as soon never see without a 
high fence between you and him. But he never harmed anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I'm sure there would be some disagreement over that from the gas 
meter-reader who slammed his shin -- quite painfully, judging from the thunk of 
the impact and the even louder shouting that ensued -- into the bumper of my 
Fiat many years ago when Max chased him down the driveway. But let's not 
nit-pick here. Let's just say that Max never actually ate a human being, and 
leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
One day, during his prime, I took him for a walk inside the fence of an 
abandoned Army base in San Pedro. He quickly disappeared, and a minute later a 
man drove by and asked what I was doing there. When I told him, he winced. 
</P>
<P>
"Better find that dog of yours in a hurry," he said. "We've got a guard dog 
patrolling out here. Believe me, you don't want him finding your dog." 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the two big dogs appeared at opposite ends of a muddy, 50-yard 
field. They began a very dramatic charge toward each other. When they collided, 
we could hear the impact from 100 feet away. And in about 20 seconds the guard 
dog was screeching wildly in full retreat, apparently out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
Max came back to me with German shepherd fur in his mouth. Only dog-owners know 
this feeling, but I was, at that moment, the proudest damn guy in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
An outing at a friend's cabin in Big Bear turned into an equally marvelous 
adventure. I left Max alone in the cabin for five minutes while I went for 
cigarettes. When I returned, he had shredded four curtains, broken two lamps 
and crashed through a window. He did everything but turn on the gas and light a 
match. Apparently he had missed me. The damage came to $450. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, my dog and I embarked on an all-night drive (I had to do all the 
driving) into the Sierras for a camping trip. Just outside Bridgeport, as the 
dawn broke, a small herd of deer crossed in front of my car. Figuring Max 
needed to stretch his legs after four hours in a Fiat, I flung the door open. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't see him again for two hours. He finally emerged from the wilderness 
nearly a mile from where I had turned him loose. And no, of course he had not 
caught a deer. 
</P>
<P>
But he sure seemed proud of the rabbit! 
</P>
<P>
Around the kids Max was a different dog. When Maggie or Nicholas would be 
nearby, Max would follow them very carefully. He seldom got too close, seeming 
not to need their love in order to give his. 
</P>
<P>
When we had friends at the house, he would lie down beside our daughter. If 
anybody he didn't know stood up, he would also rise and move closer to her, 
fixing a hard gaze on the upright human. The message was not difficult to 
interpret, a silent signal from a dog that was something along the lines of, 
"If you would like to continue using both hands to button your shirt, I would 
suggest taking a step or two away from her, if you wouldn't mind." 
</P>
<P>
The cancer came quickly, showing itself first in a swelling on his right 
foreleg. I agreed to a $600 surgical removal of the diseased tissue that a 
veterinarian said might buy Max a few months of limpless days. It didn't. But 
it was worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
When the cancer came back stronger than ever just a few weeks later, he began 
licking the wound constantly. He, like myself, seemed to think of himself as 
indestructible. The nagging pain seemed to confuse him more than hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the limp became severe. At night, as I looked out at him through a 
bathroom window, I could hear him whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
He could still run a bit. On his last day he climbed a 200-foot hill in our 
back yard. It took him five minutes. Two months ago he could make it to the top 
in 20 seconds. He likely could have lasted another month or so, but the pain 
would have been too much for both of us. 
</P>
<P>
The night before he died I defrosted a three-pound London broil roast and gave 
it to him in the back yard. I felt pretty ridiculous doing it. He ate it in 
about four minutes. I considered inviting 11 of his dog friends over for this 
last supper, but knew that would be sacrilegious. So he ate alone. 
</P>
<P>
I crept outside early in the morning and stretched out beside him on an old 
mattress he slept on. He licked my arm and plopped his head against my 
shoulder, and we slept for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, I knelt on the cold linoleum of the veterinarian's office 
and removed Max's leash and collar, the same collar he wore as he chased the 
meter-reader and the guard dog and the mule deer. The same collar he wore 
everywhere for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
I hugged him and I cried and then he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
But what the hell, he was just a dog.

'JUNGLELAND' PROJECT'S COST STILL UNCLEAR; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: A SUIT OVER THE VALUE OF THE FORMER THEME PARK SITE HAS BEEN 
DELAYED, AND A CRITIC OF THE CITY'S PLAN PREDICTS 'FINANCIAL DISASTER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although Thousand Oaks officials are forging ahead with plans for a $75-million 
civic and commercial complex, a lingering dispute over the price of the land is 
slated to bring the city into court next spring and threatens to increase the 
cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is how much the city should pay for a condemned, 20-acre site off the 
Ventura Freeway, former location of the defunct Jungleland theme park. The 
trial of a suit brought by the land's former owner had been scheduled to begin 
this week in Ventura Superior Court, but a backlog of cases postponed the 
matter until April 9, 1990, lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed joint venture between the city and Lowe Development Corp. of Los 
Angeles would include a government center with a new City Hall, a civic 
auditorium and a hotel-office complex at the vacant site at Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard and Conejo School Road. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been mired in controversy since it was first discussed 10 years 
ago, and critics say the real estate dispute is symptomatic of the city's lack 
of realistic planning. 
</P>
<P>
"That project is going to be a financial disaster," said Heinrich (Corky) 
Charles, a former Thousand Oaks planning commissioner and outspoken opponent of 
the "Jungleland" proposal. "If you were a business person, would you build 
something and then get an endowment to pay for it?" asked Charles, who led a 
failed effort to place the issue on a local ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Elois Zeanah, president of the League of Conejo Homeowners Assns. who has 
questioned the project's effect on traffic, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong for the city to spend so much money ramrodding it through and to 
make it a fait accompli without knowing how much it would finally cost," said 
Zeanah, an unsuccessful candidate in the special City Council election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark G. Sellers and City Manager Grant Brimhall 
insisted this week that the disagreement is nothing more than a loose thread in 
an ambitious undertaking well on its way to finally being built. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not at all unusual," Brimhall said. "It happens in almost every public 
project where there is a necessity to acquire property. Sometimes these 
proceedings take years and years to conclude, and public interest and necessity 
demands that you proceed with the project and ultimately pay the value 
determined by the courts." 
</P>
<P>
The city has already paid $12.75 million to take possession of the property, 
which it condemned in 1987. But former owner Assadollah Morovati claims he is 
entitled to $26 million, representing both the land and its potential value had 
he been allowed to develop it, said his attorney, Richard L. Franck of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Morovati's legal claim against the city charges that Thousand Oaks officials 
stonewalled his attempts to build a shopping center and offices on the site, 
Franck said. He said Morovati spent about $2 million and six years on 
engineering, architectural and environmental studies in an effort to comply 
with city demands -- only to have his proposal turned down and his property 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, the city procrastinated and wouldn't approve 
anything to speak of and kept calling for additional studies and this, that and 
the other thing. Then they finally decided they wanted it themselves so they 
condemned it," said Franck. "So we're contending the city engaged in 
unreasonable pre-condemnation conduct causing us a substantial amount of 
damages." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Morovati and the city broke down in August after the city 
offered $14 million for the land and Morovati demanded no less than $19 
million, Franck and Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the City Council has approved a required environmental impact 
report and hired architects for the government center and civic auditorium. 
Sellers said the city is in the process of negotiating 
</P>
<P>
a contract with the architects and a joint-venture agreement with Lowe 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Thousand Oaks and Lowe would include terms of the city's 
lease of the site to the private developer and divide the cost of a parking 
deck and landscaping, Sellers and Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to pay for the civic auditorium and government center, estimated 
to cost $14 million and $12 million, respectively, with bonds issued by its 
redevelopment agency and revenue from the sale of two former city halls, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the city will cover any additional cost for the land, Brimhall 
replied: "a determination would have to be made as to what funding sources are 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said the redevelopment agency has a cash reserve from the sale of 
bonds. He declined to disclose the amount, arguing it might affect the 
litigation with Morovati. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who is a vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. office 
in Pasadena, predicted that the unresolved dispute will help send the project 
into debt because of unanticipated land and interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city does not levy property taxes, residents will suffer, Charles 
said, because municipal revenue will be used to offset the project's debt 
instead of maintaining services.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SUSPECTS HELD IN GANG KILLING OF PACOIMA MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were arrested on suspicion of murder stemming from a gang-related 
shooting earlier this week in Pacoima, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Johnson, 19, of Canoga Park and Maurice Jones, 19, of Panorama City were 
arrested Thursday in connection with the death of Timothy Walls three days 
earlier, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Walls, 20, of Pacoima was shot Monday night while standing at Van Nuys 
Boulevard and Borden Avenue in Pacoima, police said. A 17-year-old Pacoima boy, 
whose name was not disclosed, was seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand would not discuss how detectives identified Johnson and Jones as 
suspects in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-millimeter automatic pistol was recovered at Jones' residence, leading 
investigators to suspect that he fired the shots, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Jones were being held without bail at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Foothill Division. Detectives will seek murder charges against 
them Monday, Ferrand said.

DID BABIES REALLY CRY 'FOR EXERCISE?'; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: WHAT SOUNDED RIGHT FOUR DECADES AGO SOUNDS CRUEL TODAY. A GRANDMOTHER 
TAKES EXCEPTION TO THE "GOOD OLD DAYS" OF BABY-RAISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN LITTLEJOHN AABERG, Jean Littlejohn Aaberg is publications editor for 
Helen Morgan public relations in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Your basic stereotypical grandmother, as I understand it, is inclined to offer 
unsolicited advice about the nurturing of babies and the superior methods of 
the good old days. At the risk of losing my card-carrying status, I would like 
to go on record as a dissenting grandmother. It is my opinion that the current 
concepts of child care are infinitely better than those of my generation. This 
revelation came to me recently when I re-read "Babies are Fun," a how-to book 
for young mothers that I wrote in 1942, pre-Dr. Spock. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the birth of my first grandchild, it occurred to me that this book 
might make an amusing shower gift. I retrieved a copy from the top shelf, 
glanced through it for the first time in years, and discovered that nearly all 
of the advice was completely out of sync with today's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
As I recall, my book was carefully researched and backed by professional input. 
I suppose I was only reflecting the attitudes of that particular era, but at 
the time I thought I knew everything. The reviewers seemed to agree with me: 
"Funny as it is, the advice in this whimsical little book is practically 
fool-proof." . . . "It tells in a cheery, bright style all the things a new 
mother should know, and presents a merry, efficient picture of family 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some of the comments were witty, and a few of the pages may have 
contained pertinent information. It was the sprightly, offhand attitude that 
disturbed me. The subject of a baby's crying, for instance, was dismissed with 
a "merry, efficient" wave of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
From an early chapter: "Setting up good sleep habits is a tough proposition. It 
takes a certain amount of nerve and a complete defiance of the infant's will. 
Here is what you do. After he has been fed, watered, diapered and praised, put 
him in bed. Tuck the blankets around him and walk out of the room. He screams. 
You come back to satisfy your conscience. Is he cold? Is he too warm? Is he 
hiccuping? Does he draw his legs up as though he might have stomach cramps? No, 
none of these things. Walk out again and let him yell. Hold him or rock him and 
you are defeated." Somehow this bit of prose has an ominous ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
A few pages later there was more of the same: "It is a dangerous thing, this 
becoming a parent, and you will have to strike out hard to keep your identity. 
Now is the time when you can give up the ship, or rise like a phoenix, renewed 
and victorious. Being overly concerned is healthy and normal, but don' t forget 
that babies have a way of crying just for the activity of it." 
</P>
<P>
After this dreary trip down memory lane it was refreshing to return to 1989 and 
embrace the tenets of the hug-a-baby school of thought. True, the new gurus are 
sometimes as dogmatic as those of the old school, but their message has more 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
In the current proliferation of baby-oriented books and magazines the simple 
truths are reiterated. For the newborn, crying is the only way to communicate. 
It can have many causes -- hunger, pain, discomfort, fear of separation, fear 
of loud noises, and a dozen other reasons that the baby can't verbalize. 
</P>
<P>
To comfort the crying baby, the present-day authorities recommend physical 
contact, soft music and, of all things, the rhythm of the old-fashioned rocking 
chair. According to their code, cuddling is as important as nourishment. It is 
all very comforting and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
As I continued my study of "Babies Are Fun," another glaring fault came to 
light. The role of the father was almost entirely ignored. References to the 
father as such were scarce, but those that I did find were significant. 
</P>
<P>
From a chapter titled "After the Shouting Is Over": "Now that the baby is home, 
it is time to bring father into the fold. If that fine gentleman, your husband, 
is not treated as a brash intruder, he might enjoy learning some of the 
ridiculous things about a baby as much as you do. But don't say 'Here, Daddy, 
hold the brat. All you've been doing is sitting in a quiet office all day.' 
That sort of attitude is revolting as well as unsuccessful." 
</P>
<P>
The times, they have changed. A recent cover story of The Times Sunday Magazine 
featured fathers raising their offspring. The baby-oriented magazines abound 
with articles by and about fathers. Fathering is trendy and the media is well 
aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
So how did all this come about? Like all sociological changes, it is almost 
impossible to analyze. To explain the earlier attitudes, some commentators cite 
the teachings of Freud or the influence of the women's liberation movement. No 
one seems to agree on what brought about the change. The important thing is 
that the pendulum has swung back and forth and is now in a salubrious position. 
Today's parents can relax and rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to my former persona, I would like to include this final quote from 
my book: "What you should remember consciously is joy, unworried, unqualified 
joy. Your baby needs to know that life can be beautiful, parents can be human, 
and home can be a happy and interesting place. And you need to keep in mind, 
most of all, no matter what, despite diapers and tantrums, and come-what-may -- 
that babies are always fun." That much, at least, is still valid.

RICHARD NIXON: HE CAN GO TO CHINA AS ENVOY EXTRAORDINAIRE, BUT THE WORLD TODAY 
IS LESS AMENABLE TO HIS GRAND DIPLOMACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris is the author of Richard Milhouse Nixon: The Rise 
of an American Politician, 1913-1952 (Henry Holt &amp; Co.), the first of a 
three-volume biography. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You're crazy. No one goes to China." 
</P>
<P>
It was the spring of 1934, and young Dick Nixon was earnestly warning a fellow 
graduate at Whittier College against accepting a fellowship at a Chinese 
university. It was much too risky, he told Osmyn Stout. "Don't get in trouble 
with all those militarists." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, more than a half century later, there was Richard Nixon himself back 
in China, taking the political and public-relations risk of talking to a 
Communist leadership that so recently and so brutally crushed popular 
demonstrations for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For Nixon at least, the visit was a small replica of his diplomatic master 
stroke 17 years ago, when in a sense he gambled his own presidency on a trip to 
China and began the opening that would change the face of world politics. It 
was also an escape, a redemption of sorts. The week that began with an actor 
re-creating on ABC television the hunched shoulders and rambling dialogue of 
that tragic twilight of the Nixon White House, the death throes of Watergate, 
ended with news photos of a real-life, smiling Nixon working a crowd in 
downtown Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
He informed the Chinese leaders "in unminced fashion," said an aide, that they 
had better ease the crackdown. In 20 hours of talk, we are told, the 
76-year-old former President ranged over the turbulent horizon of international 
affairs -- the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Indochina, the world economy. 
Nixon the grand strategist, the blunt but skillful diplomat, just like old 
times. 
</P>
<P>
China has always been a strange, twisting thread in Richard Nixon's remarkable 
life. He grew up in a California where anti-Orientalism was virulent, where 
local politicians pandered to prejudice no less than in the Deep South, where 
conditions were so awful at one point that Chinese families traveled to Los 
Angeles to disinter their dead from the basin's ground. 
</P>
<P>
He would find no Chinese history, no real view of Asian or the non-European 
world, in the narrow, parochial curriculum of 1930s' Whittier High or College. 
But on occasion when speakers would visit the campus to talk about the 
momentous current events of the era -- China's civil strife and Japanese 
aggression, the crucible from which Communist China would eventually emerge -- 
Nixon paid attention. "We'd let it pass off," one of his college friends said 
of those talks. "Nixon listened." 
</P>
<P>
Later, China would exert a fateful, often hidden force in Nixon's political 
rise. Alfred Kohlberg, a millionaire thanks to Chinese textile sweatshops, was 
an early backer and crucial nexus in the Alger Hiss case. The China lobby of 
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek was instrumental in Nixon's election to the 
Senate in 1950. Even through his years in the political wilderness, after his 
defeat for the California governorship in 1962, there were recurring stories of 
his fascination with China and of an involvement with a beautiful Eurasian 
woman from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
He would begin planning his diplomatic China Card in the mid-1960s, long before 
he announced his return to politics. And, with rich irony, it would be Anna 
Chennault, an element of the old China lobby, who played a crucial role behind 
the scenes in his presidential election of 1968. For those who knew the history 
and his secret ambition, the startling visit to the Chinese Communists and 
seeming betrayal of his old Nationalist patrons came as no real surprise. "The 
Chinese are a great and vital people who should not remain isolated from the 
international community," he wrote to the staff of the National Security 
Council in 1970, more than two years before he went to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was always something more here than China itself. Instinctively, 
temperamentally, Nixon vastly preferred the symmetry, the neatness and 
conclusiveness, of secret diplomacy. Especially with tyrants, with men who 
could make things stick, it was all far preferable to the heated, chaotic 
byplay of American domestic politics. No messy congeries of interests to 
accommodate, no leaks to the press to spoil the drama, no anarchy of popular 
pressure. Like his office and home, the starched white shirts his mother ironed 
and the presidential cuff links he always wore, this was an orderly universe. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sense about the Nixon who came to the White House in 1969 that he 
was somehow in the wrong office, that he had so studied and relished foreign 
policy that he was preparing all those years not to be President, but rather a 
great secretary of state, a foreign minister absorbed in his beloved 
initiatives with none of the fears and flailings of a political existence he 
half despised. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it was -- and is -- not to be. In February, 1972, he first went to China 
in the shadow of sagging popularity polls and uncertainty at home. Three months 
later he was in Moscow for another bold stroke, but the "plumbers" had already 
made their first try at the Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Nixon makes his reappearance as envoy extraordinary, the world is less 
than ever amenable to his quiet, controlling talks. The young men of the 
intifada, the peasants of the Brazilian rain forest, the striking workers of 
Poland and the Soviet Union, and, yes, the brave students of Tian An Men Square 
-- they and so many others are taking decisions out of the chancellories. While 
Beijing and a few other capitals are the last holdouts against democracy, their 
days are clearly numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon's grand diplomacy of 1972 may account for his enduring stature as 
politician and President, but it is not a feat anyone, not even the master 
himself, is going to repeat.

DO WE REALLY NEED THE B-2? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is poised to pay for at least two more B-2 Stealth bombers at $530 
million each, the most expensive airplane in the nation's history. But it also 
has attached enough strings to the program to make certain that the B-2 does 
not fly away with the defense budget. That makes sense, in light of a study 
that says that the United States would spend l4 times as much to hit a target 
with a B-2 as it would have to spend to hit the same target with alternative 
weapons already on hand. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 is the most expensive item in the defense budget this year, but some 
other expenses are as hard to justify in a budget that will be in real decline 
for the fifth straight year. What one senator called a "ruthless lobbying 
effort" persuaded the House and Senate conference committee to let Grumman 
Corp. build 18 more F-14D fighter planes that the Navy did not want in order to 
save jobs on Long Island in New York. Because Congress cannot agree whether to 
build the big mobile missiles that Republicans want or the smaller missiles 
that Democrats want, Congress agreed to fund both. 
</P>
<P>
But the big spender is the hump-backed flying wing, designed and built in ways 
that make it hard to spot on radar, hence the Stealth designation. In theory, 
the B-2 could pounce on targets before an enemy knew it was coming. But 
according to a recent analysis published by Harvard University's International 
Security magazine, using a B-2 would cost more than using a Midgetman missile, 
a single-warhead missile that the Air Force has resisted as too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ability to sneak past radar may not even be important in a war. 
The bomber would reach targets in the Soviet Union long after the United States 
had started retaliating with long-range missiles that might well have destroyed 
or at least ripped big holes in the radar screen of the Soviet air-defense 
network, so Stealth would not be important. If some radar were to survive, 
there are nearly 100 B-1b bombers already on duty that the Air Force itself 
says are nearly as elusive as the B-2. The B-1b also could be armed with cruise 
missiles that it could fire at targets from outside the range of Sovier radar. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force argues that only bombers can retaliate effectively against 
missile silos protected by thick concrete cocoons, but new missiles being built 
for the Navy's Trident submarines are so accurate that they could do that job 
as well as a bomber. Stealth bombers would be good for dropping bombs that 
would burrow into Soviet command posts and explode, the Air Force says. But 
does that mission make sense? Would America want to kill the only Soviets who 
might be able and willing to call off a nuclear war? 
</P>
<P>
For some years, the Air Force promoted the B-2 as the only way of finding 
Soviet missiles that can be moved around on trucks and railroad cars. But, 
again, the Air Force itself acknowledges that technology for guiding bombers to 
mobile targets does not exist and is not even in sight. The technology is 
important because no B-2 crew could hope to locate hidden missiles by peering 
through smoke billowing up from the rubble of nuclear explosions. 
</P>
<P>
There are other arguments for the B-2, each matched by an argument against it. 
The strongest case for the plane is its technology. Its graphite wings and 
titanium fuselage make it lighter and its shape creates less drag in flight. 
The combination adds up to a more energy-efficient aircraft, features that may 
well lend themselves to commercial application as pilots and engineers gain 
experience with the plane. But the aerospace industry does not need an entire 
fleet of 132 bombers to expand and perfect the technology. 
</P>
<P>
Conceivably, the B-2 could serve as a bargaining chip in arms control talks. 
But the Soviets so far seem not to need any chips in return for agreeing to 
cuts in their defense budget so that funds can be diverted to consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
There is an argument that the B-2 stabilizes nuclear forces -- stability being 
arms control jargon for a balance of weapons on both sides that reduces fears 
of a surprise attack. Bombers are slower than missiles and, unlike missiles, 
can be called back if they are launched by mistake. But any bomber meets that 
test. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force also wants the B-2 because under a so-called counting rule the 
START treaty for cuts in nuclear weapons would allow it to carry as many 
warheads as the Air Force could cram into it, unlike a B-1b, for example, armed 
with cruise missiles. But as Times writer Robert Toth reported earlier this 
year, many defense analysts believe the services already have more warheads 
focused on targets than they really need. 
</P>
<P>
With logic stacked against the B-2 in so many respects, the fact that it 
survived seven weeks of logrolling in conference committee begs an important 
question. Why? 
</P>
<P>
One answer may be that the Air Force has spread contracts for bits and pieces 
of the Stealth bomber into nearly every state, as it did with the B-1b, so that 
there are jobs at stake in a majority of states and districts. 
</P>
<P>
Another may be that Congress has been persuaded that it cannot kill the B-2 and 
still get deep cuts in intercontinental nuclear missiles under the START 
negotiations under way in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said that Washington's intentions to sign a 
START treaty assumed that the B-2 would be part of any new and smaller force of 
nuclear weapons that might emerge. But Washington can change its assumptions 
about the next generation of strategic forces more easily than it could go back 
and renegotiate all of START. 
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis in International Security by Michael Brown of the 
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, there are alternatives 
to the B-2 that can do any job that the $530-million bomber can do and do it 
for far less. The alternatives, including new missiles for the Navy's Trident 
submarine and the Midgetman also would be far less vulnerable to a surprise or 
accidental attack than would the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress must spend scarce federal dollars on defense, it can find more 
worthy causes than the full fleet of Stealth bombers. As of now, two will be 
enough. One prime candidate for further spending would be new equipment for the 
smaller American force that will be required in Europe after a conventional 
arms-reduction treaty is negotiated, perhaps as early as next year.

WARNING FLAGS ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World Health Organization is calling for a broader commitment to the 
efforts to contain the AIDS pandemic, warning that flagging interest is raising 
the risk of a more rapid spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that 
causes the disease. It is a timely notice, coming as it does when many 
Americans seem to be paying less attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap between the pace of the epidemic and the prevention and control 
efforts is threatening to widen," according to Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of 
the WHO Global Program on AIDS. "Even though we can say today for the first 
time that activities against AIDS are now under way in every country in the 
world, we are locked in a race for control of an epidemic as fatal as any the 
world has ever known." 
</P>
<P>
WHO calculates that 5 million have been infected by HIV, that 600,000 have 
developed AIDS, that more than 300,000 have died. By the year 2000, the 
HIV-infected population will rise to 15 million, with the AIDS case total at 6 
million and the cumulative death toll at more than 3 million. Those numbers 
could prove too low, however, if the epidemic takes hold in Asia. And, 
according to Dr. Mann, they might be reduced by 1 million if there is a 
toughening of national programs. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the global AIDS case load are continuously being revised, and, 
without exception, they are being revised upwards, measuring the gravity of the 
situation. A study by world experts of that case load in May estimated a total 
of 375,000 AIDS cases. By June, however, Mann had revised that figure to 
480,000. And in recent testimony to the National AIDS Commission, he further 
revised the estimate to 600,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a cure, the only control is through prevention. But education 
and prevention programs, including sex education and distribution of condoms, 
have been lagging. There are particular threats of a spread of the disease now 
among the 5 million intravenous drug users scattered around the world, and 
among the 100 million persons who each year contract sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"Societies are still reluctant to confront the underlying problems which create 
and enhance vulnerability to AIDS," according to Dr. Mann. "This entails 
tackling problems such as drug use, access to health services, discrimination, 
prostitute-client relationships and education of young people about sex." 
</P>
<P>
Mann warned in particular about the dangers of discrimination against people 
with behaviors that increase the risk of HIV infection or who have contracted 
the virus. "Ignoring discrimination may be politically expedient but it is 
dangerous to society and to public health," he affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Global efforts are now characterized by a widening gap between what rich 
countries can do, extending the lives of infected persons with costly 
treatments, and what the poor nations are able to do, he noted. "The combined 
AIDS expenditures for California and New York exceed the resources currently 
available for AIDS in the entire developing world." 
</P>
<P>
But even in California, his counsel leaves no room for complacency. There is 
continued resistance to the kinds of education programs likely to be most 
effective in containing the spread of the virus at the critical points: Among 
young people, minorities, and intravenous drug users.

ISRAEL AND ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Gorenberg's great article, it was written on such a high moral track 
that it was uplifting to me personally as it would be to any offspring of 
survivors of the Armenian massacres of 1915-1921 by the Ottoman Turks. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish interference in the affairs of sovereign nations such as Israel is not 
a new phenomenon, however. Open Turkish involvement in the internal affairs of 
our country has long surpassed even intolerable levels. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, former Rep. George E. Danielson, fought the Turkish lobby in 
Washington all through the 1970s and early '80s as the Turks successfully 
importuned the Nixon and succeeding administrations to join in its bankrupt 
denial of the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Turks. Here's just one example 
of Turkish interference: When Rep. Danielson was granted prior approval for a 
contingent of the U.S. Marine Corps band to participate in ground-breaking 
ceremonies of the Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello, Calif., the Turkish 
embassy got wind of it and successfully persuaded the Nixon Administration to 
cancel the Marine Corps appearance. Reason given by the Administration: "The 
band needed to practice." 
</P>
<P>
So, if "keeping good ties with Turkey is a shameful excuse for Israel's 
lobbying against a memorial -- an American one, at that -- to the Turks' 
massacre of 1 million Armenians," then the Bush Administration's lobbying 
against that same memorial for the same reason is not only no less shameful but 
morally corrupt and indefensible on any grounds, because it relegates the lives 
and revered memories of 1 1/2 million Armenian martyrs to mere pawns. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe Times readers are not aware that Turkey is also butting in on our 
internal affairs by lobbying hard for the omission of the Armenian genocide in 
the Holocaust memorial being built in Washington, D.C., even though the 
original Monument Commission committed itself to include it. 
</P>
<P>
Who listens, then, when the Bush Administration sounds off on lives lost at 
Tian An Men Square in China? Selective morality is immorality!

CLOSING OF HERALD EXAMINER ENDS COLORFUL NEWSPAPER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times pompously declares in its Nov. 2 editorial that the Herald Examiner 
folded, in part, because "the public's appetite for such reportage is satisfied 
by lesser television talk shows." In this same editorial phrases such as 
"working-class tastes" and "entertaining sensationalism of yellow journalism" 
are used. This display of arrogant elitism will make the loss of the Herald all 
the more painful. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald considered its readers as peers writing for them and to them not at 
them as a didactic parent. Come on Times, don't take yourself so seriously, 
none of us do.

WOMAN CHARGES POLICE BRUTALITY, BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: A GAS-COMPANY AUDITOR'S LAWSUIT CLAIMS ARRESTING OFFICERS BEAT HER 
BECAUSE SHE ISN'T WHITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In opening arguments of a lawsuit against five Simi Valley police officers, an 
attorney for a black woman contended the officers acted out of racial bias when 
they knocked her down and beat her during an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
A defense attorney denied the allegations of racial prejudice, saying the 
officers wrestled Debra Thomas to the ground because she was resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 32, an auditor for the Southern California Gas Co. and a mother of 
four, was mistakenly arrested by five Simi Valley officers who kicked open a 
door to her home June 8, 1988. She and her family are seeking $10 million in 
damages for pain and emotional suffering. 
</P>
<P>
In the civil trial, which began Friday despite the federal Veteran's Day 
holiday, attorney Stephen Yagman said officers arresting Thomas "knocked her to 
the ground, injured her and beat her in front of her family." 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show that there was a racial bias here, and that a 
middle-class white person would not be treated like this." 
</P>
<P>
He argued that if Thomas were white, officers would have investigated when she 
told them the warrant for her arrest on suspicion of forgery had been 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
In fact the warrant, issued May 12 by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, 
had been withdrawn because Thomas had appeared in Superior Court to resolve the 
matter. It was issued after Thomas, who was on probation for forgery, violated 
the terms of the probation by bouncing a $40 check, according to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Bert H. Deixler said that in arresting Thomas, the officers 
acted in "good faith" that the arrest warrant was still valid. 
</P>
<P>
Before the officers entered the home, Deixler said, they checked with their 
dispatcher who verified that the warrant was valid. They did not believe 
Thomas' claim, he said, because she became hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Deixler said that when officers told Thomas they had a warrant for her arrest, 
she began to "scream bloody murder, to flail and squirm and resist arrest. She 
was punching and kicking the police officers." 
</P>
<P>
Deixler denied that the officers used excessive force to subdue Thomas, saying 
that their conduct inside the house was appropriate, consistent with standard 
police practice and not influenced by racial considerations.

BUSH-GORBACHEV SUMMIT IN MALTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush-Gorbachev meeting presents President Bush an ideal opportunity to 
reaffirm America's non-recognition policy concerning the Soviet occupation of 
the Baltic states. It is also a chance for America to pursue the corollary of 
the non-recognition policy, namely, that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania must 
have their independence restored. 
</P>
<P>
The December conference should be used by President Bush to pursue a diplomatic 
solution to the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, patterned on the 
Austrian experience, whereby Soviet troops are withdrawn and all of the Baltic 
states resume their status as neutral, independent nations. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 23, 2 million Balts formed a human chain stretching from Vilnius, 
Lithuania, through Riga, Latvia, to Tallinn, Estonia, in order to demonstrate 
their desire for independence and their determination to achieve the 
fundamental rights which America's Declaration of Independence and Bill of 
Rights stand for. It behooves America and President Bush to support their 
aspirations.

ISRAEL AND ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anent Gershom Gorenberg's column ("Israel Demeans Itself in an Affront to 
Armenians," Op-Ed Page, Oct. 30) on the Senate's consideration of a resolution 
declaring next April 26 as a memorial day for the 1 1/2 million Armenians 
devastated by the Turkish troops of Enver Pasha, and the ambiguity towards the 
resolution expressed by some alleged Jewish lobbyists: 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the proposed date for the remembrance of the slaughter that 
destroyed half the Armenian population in Anatolia during World War I, the 
Jewish community will commemorate Yom Hashoah, the Holocaust that annihilated 6 
million Jews and 5 million non-Jews by the design of Nazi barbarism. More than 
calendar proximity ties these two tragic events together. Both genocidal 
atrocities mark a kinship of suffering that should unite the actual and 
potential victims of totalitarian repression. Moreover, the two events are 
historically and morally related. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Hitler, urging the war of extermination against "all men, women, and 
children of the Polish race or language" at Obersalzburg on Aug. 22, 1939, 
sought to assure the military commanders of the Third Reich that the world 
would remain indifferent to their death design. His argument rested on the 
following rhetorical question: "Who still talks nowadays of the extermination 
of the Armenians?" Hitler used the same logic in launching his plan for a 
"final solution," the war against the Jews which resulted in the destruction of 
one-third of the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
No people is an island, no event on this crowded planet can be isolated from 
another. And no games of "one-downsmanship" should place one people's suffering 
over another. Genocidal tragedies are indivisible. For the sake of the 
post-Holocaust generation, all people should support the Senate Judiciary's 
approval of the resolution and write their congressman to endorse the moral 
conscience the act expresses. A world is at stake.

We have double locks on our doors and an alarm system. There is a mercury vapor

After reading about the "bust" of the Granada Hills women bowlers, I know I am 
paranoid. If our law enforcement people have the crime situation so under

When Bush and Gorbachev meet they plan to have an unstructured agenda. Why not 
structure it? Why go thousands of miles at tremendous cost just to put one's 
feet up to talk? And for two days? Make it longer. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, they should bury the Cold War in the deepest bowels of the 
Mediterranean. Then the two leaders could make some preliminary proposals for 
arms cuts. Throw fear into those death merchants, the arms manufacturers. Their 
swan song is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years Gorbachev has been more peace oriented than either 
former President Reagan or Bush. Now is the time for the tentative Bush to do 
something positive in the area of peace. If these things are done, the meeting 
will be well worth it.

PRIZE LEFT-HANDER LANGSTON GRANTS AUDIENCE TO PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston, the free-agent left-handed starter who is being wooed by almost 
half of the teams in baseball, agreed Friday to a private meeting next week in 
Los Angeles with Padre Manager Jack McKeon when his agent opens negotiations 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Padres' Chicago-based attorney, is scheduled to travel in Los 
Angeles early next week and begin contract negotiations with agent Arn Tellem. 
In a separate meeting, Langston is scheduled to talk with McKeon, Tellem said, 
to discuss baseball philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Arn told me that Mark thinks very highly of Jack McKeon," Lane said, "and 
that's why he wants to meet him." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I look forward to talking to him, and as you know, I'd sure love 
to have him on our club." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 10 teams, Tellem said, that have expressed interest in 
Langston. Tellem will meet with most of them next week, but said there is no 
timetable as to when Langston will make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 29, who was born in San Diego and raised in the Bay Area, is expected 
to become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball. Those considered to be involved 
in heavy bidding besides the Padres are the Dodgers, Angels, St. Louis 
Cardinals, New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, San Francisco Giants and 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Who his top choice is depends on who you listen to. 
</P>
<P>
Many will tell you it's the Dodgers, considering that his wife is pursing an 
acting career. Others will tell you the Padres, because of the city. And some 
will say the Cardinals, with their spacious ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that he wants to play for a contender," Tellem said. 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I just hope it's us." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Padres begin negotiations with Langston, however, they hope to have 
their own free-agent pitcher -- left-handed reliever Mark Davis -- under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made a new proposal to Davis Friday, offering him a guaranteed 
three-year contract, sources said, for about $6 million. It would give Davis 
the most lucrative contract on the club, exceeding the $5.25 million for three 
years obtained last December by free-agent starter Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third offer the Padres have made to Davis since the season's 
conclusion, the second since Oct. 30, when Davis filed for free agency. It was 
made after Alan Hendricks, Davis' agent, telephoned Lane on Friday and said 
that they were looking for an increase from the Padres' last proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me, and he stated their position," Lane said, "and I stated our 
position. I then gave them a new proposal, and he said he will get back to me." 
</P>
<P>
Is Lane optimistic that Davis will accept the offer? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think they're going to do anything unless Mark decided 
they're going to do something. I don't think there's any reason for them not to 
take our proposal, but I still think they're inclined to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Teams can begin negotiations with free agents at 10 a.m. (PST) Monday. Davis 
will be in New York that day to receive his trophy as the Rolaids relief 
pitcher of the year in the National League, and Hendricks said he is sure there 
will be plenty of interest. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 84 players who have filed for free agency, no one figures to be paid 
as handsomely as Langston. Although his 86-76 career record hardly is dazzling, 
this is a pitcher who led the American League in strikeouts for three seasons 
while playing for the Seattle Mariners, who have never had a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was traded by the Mariners to Montreal on May 25 after rejecting a 
three-year, $7.1-million contract. He was 12-9 with a 2.39 ERA in four months 
with the Expos, but when they attempted to sign him, Langston reportedly turned 
down a three-year, $9 million contract.

MORNING BRIEFING: OUTSIDE THE PACIFIC 10, TROJANS ARE STRUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
The success of USC's football team brings glory to the Trojans but reflects 
negatively on the Pacific 10 Conference as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Writes Don Borst of the Tacoma Morning Tribune: "USC's ability to handle Pac-10 
foes, but inability to handle quality teams outside the league, does not speak 
well for the league's strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Trojans began their 18-game streak in conference games, they are 4-6 
in nonconference affairs, including a 66-10 rout of lowly Utah State. Against 
nonconference ranked teams, USC is 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
"That nonconference record won't be fed any scraps any time soon either. USC 
has the Rose Bowl coming up, followed by contests next year with Penn State, at 
Ohio State and Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
Add Pac-10: Borst goes on: "Oregon State hasn't quite reached the big time. At 
least, members of the Beach Boys' road crew were unimpressed that the Beavers 
were practicing in the Los Angeles Coliseum Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Beach Boys' concert following the game Saturday, the stage and sound 
system were being installed, and the roadies didn't like sharing the Coliseum 
with OSU. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the Beavers were already pretty distracted, anyway. Bo Jackson was 
there also, taping a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"We all were looking over at Bo," safety Larry Vladic said. "I mean, you 
couldn't help it. He's a monster. 
</P>
<P>
"And then the Beach Boys guys were trying to get us off the field. They said, 
'Hey, we've got a concert.' We said, 'Hey, we have a football game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: There were nine players named Johnson in the NBA last season. What 
was the second most-common surname? 
</P>
<P>
You can look it up: The Philadelphia 76ers' media guide sells for $8. And it's 
worth every penny; the guide includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A recap of every dunk made last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Technical-foul leaders since 1970. Kevin Loughery is No. 1 with 330. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A list of 1988-89's top 40 players in combined points, rebounds and 
assists, led by Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A team-by-team list of number retirements. Boston leads with 16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A breakdown of the types of injuries and illnesses that sidelined NBA 
players for at least one game last season. Of 380 injuries and illnesses, 69 
were ankle problems, followed by 52 knee injuries and 43 cases of flu. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Williams (seven), followed by Jones (six).

Quotebook: Bobby Knight, Indiana basketball coach, on a proposed postseason 
tournament to determine the Big Ten champion: "The guys who devise these things

overlooked some very important details." GARR KLUENDER

IT'S GETTING DIFFICULT FOR THESE RAM FANS TO REMAIN DEDICATED

Who does the public relations work for Fritz Shurmur? Whoever it is, give 'em a 
raise because they're the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
How else can you explain Shurmur's tenure? Year in and year out, his soft zone 
defense allows teams to march down the field. And that's with time on the 
clock. Give a team only a minute or two and Shurmur really softens it up. 
</P>
<P>
We're accustomed to it, of course. But Sunday's choke was still something 
special. They only had to hold the lead for 28 seconds! 
</P>
<P>
It has never been easy to be a Ram fan. Now, it's impossible. Where do we turn? 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. It's basketball season.

CARPENTER, BURRIDGE LEAD BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Carpenter and Randy Burridge have been linemates for only three games, 
but it looks like a good match. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter scored two goals and an assist, and Burridge had a goal and two 
assists Friday night in Landover, Md., as the Boston Bruins extended their 
unbeaten streak to four games with a 5-3 victory over the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"Three games, and we've played three great games," Carpenter said of the line 
that also includes Bob Sweeney. ". . . We play well together. We complement 
each other. I think there's a real good work ethic there." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, 3-0-1 in their last four games, scored on three of their first 
seven shots as they built a 3-0 lead in the opening 13:17 of the game. By the 
time they reached the third period, they were just trying to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Bruins were outshot, 13-4, in the final period, they ended 
Washington's four-game unbeaten streak as the Capitals fell to 3-3-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ridley's third-period goal pulled Washington within 4-3, but Boston 
defenseman Garry Galley put the game away with a goal with 3:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter has four goals in his last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Vancouver 2 -- The Sabres, last in the NHL on the power play, scored 
three goals with the man advantage at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo scored on three of four power-play opportunities to remain unbeaten at 
home this season (7-0-1). The Sabres are unbeaten in their last seven games, 
with six wins and a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Andreychuk, Alexander Mogilny, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel scored for 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
With the teams tied, 1-1, Mogilny turned in an outstanding individual effort to 
give Buffalo the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet rookie took a pass from Doug Bodger near the Vancouver blue line, 
skated around two defenders and lifted a backhand past McLean for his third 
goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Tippett made his first goal of the season a 
game-winner for the Whalers at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Tippett picked up a rebound off the end boards and beat Jet goaltender Daniel 
Berthiaume with just 2:39 left in the third period to snap a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomlak added an empty-net goal with 43 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Young and Kevin Dineen also scored for the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk broke out of a six-game pointless streak with two goals for 
Winnipeg. The third period was filled with fights, with Dan Marovelli handing 
out 33 minutes in penalties, including a high-sticking major and game 
misconduct to Pat Verbeek.

LITTLER SHOOTS 66 FOR LAS VEGAS LEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Littler, returning to the site of three of his 29 PGA Tour victories, shot 
a six-under par 66 Friday for a one-stroke lead after the first round of the 
Senior PGA Tour's Las Vegas tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Littler, who won the Tournament of Champions three successive years beginning 
in 1955 at the Desert Inn Country Club, used seven birdies to pull ahead of 
Charles Coody and Senior Tour rookie George Archer. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot back at 69 were Lee Elder and course record-holder Al Geiberger. 
Chi Chi Rodriguez, Orville Moody, John Paul Cain, Tom Shaw, Ben Smith and Lou 
Graham were next at two-under 70. 
</P>
<P>
Despite what he called "pretty pathetic ball striking," Robert Wrenn moved into 
the lead after three rounds of the Kapalua International golf tournament in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Wrenn fired a five-under-par 67, including an eagle, five 
birdies and two bogies. 
</P>
<P>
His three-day total of 14-under-par 202 was good for a one-shot lead over Steve 
Pate entering today's final round. Pate shot a 68.

Ivan Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, continued his mastery over Tim 
Mayotte with a 6-2, 6-2 victory Friday to set up a semifinal against Stefan 
Edberg in the $1-million Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, playing in Stockholm for the first time since 1978, dominated Mayotte 
and ended the match with an ace before 13,084 fans at the Globe Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lendl's 15th victory in 15 matches against Mayotte, who was seeded No. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg held off Jim Courier, joining fellow Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Mats 
Wilander in the semifinals. Edberg, the No. 3 seeded player, beat Courier, 3-6, 
6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander easily defeated Jan Gunnarsson, 6-3, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, a wild-card entry, upset No. 4 seeded Andre Agassi, 6-2, 7-6, 
assuring Sweden of a berth in the final of the world's oldest indoor Grand Prix 
tournament for the eighth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova withdrew from a $250,000 tournament in Chicago because of a 
groin injury, but said she planned to play next week in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, the world's No. 2 player, was trying to win her fifth consecutive 
title in the tournament and ninth since 1978. She had been scheduled to meet 
unseeded Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union in a quarterfinal match. 
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal matches, Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria defeated Gretchen 
Magers, 6-1, 6-1; Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia beat Ann Henricksson, 6-4, 
6-4, and Zina Garrison defeated Pam Shriver, 6-3, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe battled back after losing the first set to beat Miloslav Mecir of 
Czechoslovakia, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, and reach the semifinals of a $440,000 
tournament at Wembley, England. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded McEnroe, beaten in his two previous meetings by Mecir, held on 
to win in 2 hours 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was joined in the semifinals by Michael Chang, who beat Andrei 
Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 6-3, 6-4. While two Americans made the final 
four, two others were defeated. Robert Seguso lost, 7-5, 6-3, to Frenchman Guy 
Forget, and unseeded Australian Wally Masur upset No. 3 seeded Brad Gilbert, 
7-6, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>

Brazil.

ARMSTRONG CLOSES OUT CAREER ON SUNNY SIDE; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: UNFULFILLED AT WEST POINT, THE FORMER AGOURA HIGH PASSER IS 
FINISHING HIS CAREER AT UC SANTA BARBARA IN A GOOD FRAME OF MIND. HE HAS PASSED 
FOR 1,583 YARDS IN HIS PAST SIX GAMES.

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Armstrong always seems to save the best for last. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a fourth-and-13 situation on the last play of his high school 
career, he threw a 27-yard touchdown pass and then kicked the extra point to 
give Agoura High a Southern Section championship in 1984. Now a senior at UC 
Santa Barbara, Armstrong has led the Gauchos to a school-record six-game 
winning streak with a stunning display of sustained excellence. 
</P>
<P>
A symphony building to a crescendo, Armstrong has passed for 184, 152, 296, 
214, 312 and 425 yards in the six games since he moved into the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"That championship game in high school, and this winning streak will be some of 
my better memories," said Armstrong, whose quarterback rating is a glossy 149.0 
during the past six games. "I'm playing well, and it's a lot of fun. I have 
some good memories. All good things have to come to an end, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
His totals in the past two games, a 51-3 victory over the University of San 
Diego and a 59-0 win against Menlo College, are virtually a season in 
themselves. Despite playing only three quarters in each blowout, Armstrong 
completed 52 of 73 passes for 747 yards and eight touchdowns with no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
He set a school single-half record with 272 first-half yards against San Diego 
and broke the school single-game yardage mark against Menlo. "We don't have the 
talent to cope with him," Menlo Coach Ray Solari said. "I would say he's got a 
good name for his talents, Armstrong, strong-arm, it ties right in." 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos (7-2) will end their season this afternoon in a 1:30 homecoming 
game against Azusa Pacific, giving Armstrong, a history major, one more chance 
to scribble his name across the pages of the Santa Barbara history books. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 touchdowns, he has tied the Santa Barbara single-season record and he 
is only 210 yards, a quarter of work at his rate, shy of the yardage record. 
Armstrong (6-feet-2, 212 pounds) has compiled these numbers without playing a 
down in the first two games and playing briefly in the third against San 
Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos had left their pride in San Francisco after a 32-14 loss dropped 
them to 1-2, and Coach Rick Candaele went back to basics the next week of 
practice. He told his team to get physical, benched junior quarterback Mike 
Curtius and installed Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Armstrong's previous seasons had been cut short by injuries. He had 
been first team briefly during the preseason before an arm injury forced him to 
miss a week and a half of workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get disappointed; I think our players respected him for that," 
Candaele said. "We also decided Steve Armstrong was the guy who could give us 
the composure and leadership we needed." 
</P>
<P>
That week, Armstrong threw three touchdown passes and Santa Barbara defeated 
Cal Lutheran, 24-21. Since then, the Gauchos (7-2) have outscored their 
opponents, 191-39. "That was the turning point of our season," Candaele said. 
"He's gotten better every week. Our turnaround isn't just Steve Armstrong, but 
he's one of (the factors)." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sterbick, Santa Barbara's offensive coordinator and a former graduate 
assistant at Washington State, has modeled the Gaucho offense after the system 
former WSU Coach Dennis Erickson used with Timm Rosenbach last season. In 1988, 
Armstrong started twice and passed for 406 yards, but he has steadily grown in 
the new system. "Our offense is a lot simpler. I feel a lot more comfortable 
with it," said Armstrong, who watches an hour of film every day at 8 a.m. "I've 
also been able to able to read defenses a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
The offense uses multiple receivers to spread the field, which also opens up 
Santa Barbara's one-back running attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing he has going for him is great understanding of our offense," 
Candaele said. "He doesn't make the big mistakes that put your team in the 
hole." 
</P>
<P>
His judgment has not always been so astute. After graduating from Agoura, he 
threw himself into a situation that almost ended his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong matriculated to West Point, but after two and a half weeks of 
football practice, he was cut. Army had recruited nine quarterbacks, and there 
wasn't much room for a strong-armed Californian in Army's wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I went there for all the wrong reasons, which was football," said 
Armstrong, who had been told that Army had only recruited three quarterbacks. 
"I thought it would be more like a regular college." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong then spent a year at Moorpark College but was again caught in a 
quarterback numbers crunch. After sharing time with Steve Haddad and Dan 
Nagelmann, who started several games at Cal Lutheran this season, Armstrong 
moved on to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half removed from West Point, Armstrong was back in his element in 
sunny Isla Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"The places are totally opposite," Armstrong said. "Here, there's a very good 
social life, lots of parties, that kind of thing. At West Point, there were no 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
After Armstrong graduates at the end of the quarter, he may taste la dolce vita 
of professional sports in Italy, following the lead of former UCSB basketball 
player Brian Shaw. Steve Marks, a UCSB football assistant, also plays and 
coaches football during the winter in Italy and has expressed interest in 
recruiting Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be making quite as much money (as Shaw)," said Armstrong, who has 
wanted to travel to Europe after graduation. "If this would work out, it would 
make it a lot easier."

ALEMANY DRIVES INTO POSTSEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Elway had The Drive against the Cleveland Browns. Doug Williams had The 
Quarter in the Super Bowl against the Denver Broncos. Friday night at St. John 
Bosco High, Joey Rosselli and Alemany had The March. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli, the Southern Section's leading passer among Valley-area quarterbacks, 
marched his team 80 yards to the winning touchdown in the final five minutes to 
give Alemany a 22-21 Del Rey League victory. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany (6-4 overall, 3-1 in league play) clinched second place in the league 
and a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco (4-6, 1-3) led, 21-6, at the half, but was held scoreless in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 21-14, the Indians took over at their 20. Alemany moved to the St. 
John Bosco 28 with a drive in which it converted a fourth-and-one situation on 
Terry Barnum's four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Rosselli completed a 16-yard pass to Billy Markowitz that 
moved the ball to the Braves' eight. Barnum then carried seven yards to the one 
and Rosselli dived in with 1:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, however, still trailed, 21-20, and Scott Goldsmith's point-after 
kick failed wide right. The Braves were offside, however, and the Indians got a 
second chance from the one. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Indians went for two, and Barnum ran it up the middle for a 
22-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco nearly pulled out a win. After a short kick, the Braves took 
over at the 50 and backup quarterback Gary Manley completed a 39-yard pass to 
tight end Bryce Christiansen to put the ball at the 11 with 29 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
A delay-of-game penalty moved the ball to the 16, where Nomar Garciaparra's 
33-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Brian Brison. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli was 21 of 38 for 282 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to come back," said Rosselli. "I told the coach, 'Hey, 
let's run the quarterback sneak.' The next thing you know, I was over the line 
and I saw two arms up in the air."

CRESPI WINS GAME AND A BERTH IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call the Crespi High football team a lot of things, but through the past few 
years, helpless hasn't been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts beat St. Francis, 28-7, Friday night, but the postgame celebration 
was put on hold for more than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts (7-3 overall, 2-2 in league play) had to wait that long before 
results of another Del Rey League game between Alemany and St. John Bosco 
filtered through to La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the news arrived that Alemany had beaten St. John Bosco, qualifying 
both Alemany and Crespi for the Division I playoffs. A St. John Bosco win would 
have meant a three-way tie among Alemany, St. John Bosco and Crespi at 2-2 with 
only two playoff berths available. Instead, St. John Bosco fell to 1-3 and is 
eliminated. Crespi finished third, one game behind second-place Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Leonice Brown led Crespi with an impressive performance, rushing for 134 yards 
and one touchdown in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole situation made us think about how bad we want to play football," 
Brown said. "We don't want our season to end now." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Cody Smith completed 12 of 17 passes for 173 yards and a 
pair of touchdowns. Tight end Christian Fauria caught six passes for 91 yards, 
including a diving reception for a 24-yard touchdown in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi limited the Knights to only seven yards in the first half and 114 in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis broke the shutout in the third quarter when quarterback John Willis 
hit Mike Torres with a 14-yard pass to cut the margin to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas Freeman added a four-yard touchdown for the Celts in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts took a 21-0 lead in a first half, but the margin easily could have 
been greater. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi outgained the Knights, 205-7, and ran 31 plays to the St. Francis 14. 
However, the Celts lost two fumbles deep in Knights territory to squander 
another pair of prime scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 15-year-old sophomore, completed 10 of 13 first-half attempts for 117 
yards. Brown gained 84 yards in 10 carries.

SHOOTING SHOCKS VENTURA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only two days before a big game against Moorpark College, two Ventura College 
football players were shot late Thursday night after attending a Moorpark High 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
Leading rusher John Johnson and starting cornerback Roderick Jones, both of 
Oxnard, were injured by an apparently random shotgun blast fired from a passing 
car at a Moorpark shopping center and will miss the remainder of the season, 
including a pivotal 7:30 home game tonight against Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they've had time to digest the situation," Ventura Coach Phil 
Passno said of his players, who learned of the incident at a 9:30 practice 
Friday morning. "Obviously, their first concern is about their friends who've 
been hurt. The game takes a second-place atmosphere. After time, the feeling 
becomes that they want to play well for these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura can ill afford to lose another running back. Ryan Rapoza, who has 
rushed for 544 yards, only nine fewer yards than Johnson, will play sparingly 
because of a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
Passno scheduled a 3 p.m. workout for his quarterbacks and running backs today 
to try to sort out the backfield situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't affect too much," said Johnson, who was hit by seven pellets 
-- three of which remain in his legs -- and will attend the game in a 
wheelchair. "We've got eight running backs, and they're all good." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever replaces Johnson will have the unenviable task of facing a Moorpark 
defense ranked first in the state against the rush and fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Moorpark, unbeaten at the time, lost to Ventura, 12-10, on a 
last-second field goal. The loss knocked the Raiders out of Potato Bowl 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll probably be the toughest team we play all year long," Moorpark 
Coach Jim Bittner said. "It's like the USC-UCLA type thing. You like to play 
good against your friends. . . . I think it's a good rivalry. I think both 
programs tend to make the other stronger. It's almost like two brothers going 
at it." 
</P>
<P>
The teams initially met in 1968, and they split the first two contests. Ventura 
won 10 in a row from 1972 to 1981 and holds a 16-5 advantage. Despite winning 
two of the past three meetings, Moorpark still has a chip on its shoulder pads. 
"Coach Bittner gave us a pep talk," linebacker Scott Yurek said. "He said when 
Moorpark was down for all those years, Ventura beat them, but now it's 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
This time, the game should decide more than just the champion of Ventura 
County. If Moorpark (7-1, 6-1 in Western State Conference play, 3-0 in the 
Northern Division) wins, it will be guaranteed at least a share of the Northern 
Division championship. Ventura (7-1, 6-1, 2-1) needs to beat Moorpark and 
Glendale to win the Northern Division. Moorpark and Ventura are ranked ninth 
and 11th in the state, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has been so focused on playing Moorpark that it was upset last week by 
Harbor, 26-20. "I think the attitude was we lost the game because we couldn't 
concentrate," Passno said. "We thought so much about winning this (Moorpark) 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark also was banged up in its last game, a four-hour marathon win over 
Glendale. Yurek, who almost blocked Ventura's winning kick last year, has a 
severely sprained ankle but may play. Leading receiver James Gambrell could 
miss the rest of the season because of a strained medial collateral ligament. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's offense ranks second in the state. Quarterback Jayson Merrill has 
passed for 1,380 yards, and Freddie Bradley, the leading scorer in the state, 
has rushed for 971 yards.

Western Christian 14, L.A. Baptist 7 -- A 70-yard drive and L. A. Baptist's 
chances for an automatic playoff bid ended when tailback Colyn Van Buren's pass 
was intercepted by Terry Noice at Western Christian's two-yard line with a 
minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for second place at Monroe High, Western Christian (5-5, 4-1) took an 
early lead as Jix Cortes scored on first-quarter runs of 39 and two yards. 
Cortes finished with 116 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist (7-3, 3-2) broke into Lancer territory only once in the first 
half, but a Chris Robinson pass was intercepted by Noice, ending its only 
threat. Midway through the third quarter, Dinari Williams' fumble was recovered 
by L. A. Baptist's Jeff Hampsten at the Lancers' 21-yard line. Six plays later, 
Van Buren ran one yard for a score. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist had the ball on its two-yard line after a Lancer punt, then an 
18-yard run by Dan Stepper and three consecutive completions by Robinson, 
including two for 51 yards to Kurt Rayners, put the ball on the Lancers' 28 
before Van Buren's interception. ANDY MEYERS

HOME FIELD FOR FINALS ISN'T PERFECT FOR UCSD

It appears the UC San Diego women's soccer team has it made. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons are the No. 1-ranked Division III team in the country and playing 
for the national championship at home begining today with a semifinal match 
against Plymouth State at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But the home-field advantage has put pressure on the Tritons. 
</P>
<P>
"During the season, the players were saying how great it would be to host," 
said Brian McManus, UCSD soccer coach. "Now they are saying, 'Oh, there is all 
this pressure.' " 
</P>
<P>
Must be the lofty ranking and no-excuse venue that has UCSD concerned. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly 
</P>
<P>
"Now, with being at school all week and midterms going on, they can't get away 
from the pressures of school," McManus said. "Some of them took midterms 
(Friday). Usually they'd get away from school for a few days (if they were 
traveling). They're concentrating on midterms and trying to focus on the 
match." 
</P>
<P>
But the Tritons have found ways to defend themselves against adversity this 
season. Especially on the field, where UCSD has outscored its opponents, 75-2. 
The Tritons have 17 shutouts, allowing one goal by Cal State Dominguez Hills 
(which is in the NCAA Division II semifinals) and another by the College of St. 
Thomas in the first round of the West Region. 
</P>
<P>
Plymouth State (16-2) prevented a duplication of last year's final four when it 
defeated William Smith of Geneva, N.Y., the defending national champion, on 
penalty kicks. William Smith defeated UCSD, 1-0, in sudden-death overtime in 
last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
Methodist College of Fayetteville, N.C. (17-5) will play Ithaca College of New 
York (17-0-6), the only undefeated Division III team in the country, at 10 a.m. 
in the other semifinal.

<P>
Holtville finished the regular season undefeated with a 34-13 victory over 
visiting Imperial Friday night. For the second consecutive year Holtville 
(10-0, 5-0) will make a 1-A playoff appearance. Holtville was defeated in the 
playoffs last year by Marian, which finished this season, 1-9, 2-4 and will 
move to 2-A next season. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, led by quarterback Alex Wells, will play Imperial (7-3, 4-1) in 
the playoffs. Wells is averaging 145 yards per game and was ninth in the county 
in passing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain Empire 16, Army-Navy 6 -- Fullback Todd Salmons and a strong defense 
carried host Mountain Empire. Salmons ran 12 times for 99 yards and a 
touchdown, and the Mountain Empire defense recovered six fumbles. Defensive 
tackle Brian Gary recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Marian 20, Calipatria 14 -- Quarterback Bobby Applegate was 12 for 18 for 161 
yards and two touchdowns for Marian (1-9, 2-4). Jeff Hays caught six passes for 
60 yards and one touchdown for Marian. Calipatria finished the season 4-6, 1-3.

"La Cage Aux Folles" has so much heart, humor and pizazz written into it, that 
all it needs is a good-faith effort to prove irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the curious casting of a weak vocalist (Bill Mullikin) as the singing 
star Albin/ZaZa, the current Starlight Musical Theatre production at the San 
Diego Civic Theatre is proof of the show's indestructibility. 
</P>
<P>
The production, while not top drawer, should draw anyone who likes their 
melodies hummable, their lyrics memorable and their messages heartwarming. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the French farce of the same name, "La Cage" tells the story of a 
young man, Jean-Michel, who is ashamed of the parents to whom he must introduce 
his prospective in-laws. Why? His parents are a gay couple with a 20-year 
marriage, Georges and Albin. (Jean-Michel was the offspring of Georges' 
one-night fling with a woman who had no interest in the child.) 
</P>
<P>
And the prospective in-laws, the Dindons (meant to rhyme with ding-dongs), 
represent an anti-gay political party in France, where the play is set. 
</P>
<P>
Spicing up the comic clashes that ensue from these odd couples in collision is 
the setting: a transvestite nightclub, owned by Georges, starring Albin as ZaZa 
in an array of glittering dresses and a crew of "Les Cagelles," men in women's 
garb, who rip through as many as three flouncy, bouncy sequined costumes in the 
course of the opening number. (Give costume designer Theoni V. Aldredge a hand 
for making those feathers fly.) 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey Fierstein, who did the book, and Jerry Herman, who wrote the music, 
were not content with the obvious sight gags in the original farce. Together, 
they worked successfully to inject poignancy to the max in the 1983 hit 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
Can Jean-Michel persuade the flagrantly effeminate Albin to absent himself from 
the family dinner without fatally wounding the feelings of the man who cooked 
and cleaned and cared for him as his mama his whole life? 
</P>
<P>
Can Georges help his son in the one-night deception without betraying the man 
he loves? Can Albin rise above the pain of rejection to play the role of the 
parent who sacrifices his happiness for the sake of an ungrateful child he 
loves so much? 
</P>
<P>
And if all that doesn't elicit even a tiny tear from your eye, wait till you 
hear Albin's song about being asked to clear his dresses out of his closets for 
the night with the in-laws: "I Am What I Am." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am what I am/And what I am needs no excuses/ ... There's one life and 
there's no return and no deposit/One life so it's time to open up your 
closet/Life's not worth a damn/Till you can say, Hey world/I am what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics are more than a banner to gay pride; when Leslie Uggams sang it in 
the Herman revue, "Jerry's Girls," it became a woman's song. Ultimately, it 
belongs to anyone struggling with issues of self-esteem and one's place in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The song provides Mullikin's best moment, but it is not the showstopper it was 
when George Hearn, who originated the part on Broadway, played it. Mullikin 
brings vulnerability and fragility but not emotional intensity or vocal depth 
to the role. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Mullikin's ZaZa, the supposed singing star, is outclassed at every 
turn by the singing of Broadway veteran Steeve Arlen as Georges. 
</P>
<P>
Director Barry Ivan might have done more to disguise the weaknesses and 
heighten the dramatic strengths. Still, the show survives, with special kudos 
going to Arlen, who raises the company's level of professionalism with his 
suave, smooth pacing, and to Eric Davenport, who got his own separate applause 
with an opening-night standing ovation for his sassy antics as the feisty 
butler, Jacob, who aspires to be a maid. 
</P>
<P>
Other standouts are the Cagelles, featuring Bill Bateman as the catty Mercedes, 
Roger Castellano as the high-singing Chantal and Javier Velasco as the 
bullwhip-wielding Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Starlight favorite Patti Goodwin brings a badly needed soprano to the vocal mix 
as Mme. Dindon; it's a shame that Jack Ritschel, as the grumpy M. Dindon, is 
obliged to shut her up in the restaurant scene where she begins to join in on 
ZaZa's song, "The Best of Times Is Now." Mullikin could have used the help. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much depth for Kevin Schwarz as Jean-Michel and DeAnne Spicer as 
his bride-to-be, Anne, to flesh out in their respective parts; Jean-Michel 
could have benefited from more writing in Fierstein's book to explain his 
changes of heart. But the two actors acquit themselves nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The choreography by David Scala, who plays one of the Cagelles, Phaedra, is 
great fun, and well-executed by the leggy male chorus line (nice gams, guys). 
The sets by Ken Holamon are thin but move smoothly from club to cafe to beach 
scenes, adding to the glittery atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"La Cage," a brand new show for Starlight, was an inspired choice to end the 
company's 44th season. This one works, despite its flaws, but caution is in 
order for next year. The movement toward newer shows, which Starlight is 
happily taking in the 1990 season, creates higher standards for execution 
because new shows cannot rely upon the magic of nostalgia to blur their faults. 
</P>

2 SOVIET ARCHITECTS BUILD ON IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Paper architecture" was once a derogatory term used to berate the Soviet 
avant-garde of the 1930s. As practiced by Alexander Brodsky and Ilya Utkin, it 
is a conceptual endeavor that nourishes the mind and spirit as much as its 3-D 
counterpart shelters the body. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11 years since they graduated from the Moscow Architectural Institute, 
Brodsky and Utkin have only seen one of their projects realized, the interior 
of a Moscow restaurant. Like practicing architects, these "architects of the 
imagination" -- as critic Jamey Gambrell calls them -- address fundamental 
needs in their work, but not those of traffic patterns and space requirements. 
Instead, their etchings and sculptural 
</P>
<P>
installations respond to emotional and philosophical concerns. They propose 
places to facilitate the search for truth and structures to satisfy egoistic 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Their show at the San Diego State University Art Gallery -- supplemented by a 
small selection of work at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art -- merges 
the vocabularies of architecture, fantasy, history and humor. With acute 
insight and impressive technical skill, Brodsky and Utkin translate their 
musings into plans for physical structures. Each of their intricately detailed, 
marvelously rendered etchings contains a montage of trademark architectural 
elements -- the frontal view, the section, the aerial, the plan -- as well as a 
short text. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crystal Palace," the artists liken the seductive quality of false hope to a 
stunning but useless glass structure that lies just beyond town. A mecca of 
clarity and purity, the palace can always be seen on the horizon, just on the 
other side of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuer of this vision must pass through dumps and slums to arrive there, 
according to the diagram on the etching, only to find that the palace "will 
prove the other thing than it seemed afar." In one view, a visitor to the 
disappointing palace stares wistfully into the distance, and the artists ask, 
"Did he learn the very essence of the Crystal Palace; will he have a desire to 
visit it once more?" 
</P>
<P>
In many of Brodsky and Utkin's etchings, a structure serves as a metaphor for 
the individual. In "Villa Claustrophobia," they state, "A house with an atrium 
is similar to a reserved man wholly plunged into the endless space of his inner 
world." In "The Intelligent Market," the passage through a steep-walled 
labyrinth symbolizes the evolution of one's knowledge, each new turn giving a 
new perspective and new "niches" from which to observe and learn. 
</P>
<P>
The idealism of the artists' solutions gives their plans a futuristic feeling, 
but the etchings themselves, with their fine script and meticulous sepia 
markings, appear antiquated. This knotting of the past and future results in an 
arresting tension that is present as well in the installation "After a Big 
Celebration (Still Life)." 
</P>
<P>
Atop a long shelf spanning the width of the university gallery stands an array 
of carefully placed objects, all rendered in an ivory-colored plaster. Stones, 
bottles of various shapes and sizes, shards of architectural ornamentation, 
human heads and a sphinx-like creature, with a heart etched into its 
hindquarters, balance neatly, mutely, on the shelf, as if unearthed by a future 
archeologist. With their darkened cracks and abraded edges, the objects appear 
to bear the stress of time. 
</P>
<P>
Through the preponderance of bottles and inscribed slabs, Brodsky and Utkin pay 
homage to the hedonism and the earnestness of the culture they uncover. In 
their production of new yet weathered objects -- unused but of exhausted 
function -- they raise questions of obsolescence and the short skip from 
drafting table to material remains. 
</P>
<P>
The artists-architects seem drawn to things that endure. They dedicate their 
proposal for an "Island of Stability" to "those who are tired of plastic vanity 
. . . those who feel sick of foam rubber life . . . those who believe in heavy 
things that are difficult to move." One of the images in this etching pictures 
a man pushing a massive egg. 
</P>
<P>
This same scene, fully staged in plaster in the center of the gallery, exudes a 
wrenching power. The man, life-sized, leans into the giant, unyielding orb, his 
head upturned, fine striations on his forehead, and cheeks articulating his 
stoic effort. The egg, scarred, pocked and incised with lines, words and 
drawings, rests on a bed of sand. Its mottled gray shell looks organic, not the 
product of recent, carefully controlled assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the past, present and future collide in what reads, ultimately, as a 
metaphor for the eternal human condition. The man's hat and coat are those of a 
contemporary urbanite, but his fate recalls that of the mythic Sisyphus, 
condemned by the gods to push a heavy rock up a mountain, follow it down, and 
hoist it up again, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
 Brodsky and Utkin's title for the work, "Portrait of an Unknown Person in a 
Coat or Peter Carl Faberge's Nightmare," gives equal nods to the existential 
and the whimsical sides of this situation. Whether the work represents 
anonymous man toiling against hope or the famed craftsman's weightiest 
challenge, its substantial presence in the gallery also endures in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
The university show closes Dec. 6. The etchings at the La Jolla Museum remain 
on view through Dec. 10. Both are offerings of the San Diego Arts Festival: 
Treasures of the Soviet Union.

FACES: PHANTOM'S LATEST LADY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brunette Jill Schoelen was under consideration as the female lead in the new 
film version of "The Phantom of the Opera," but the producers were thinking 
blond. Schoelen held her ground, and the peroxide stayed on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"They had this vision," says the Burbank-born Schoelen, "but the problem with 
using Jill Schoelen was that I was not blond. One of the first sentences out of 
(the director's) mouth was, 'How do you feel about being a blonde?' He 
explained to me the whole 'princess' idea of the role, and I just frankly told 
him, 'Snow White is a princess too.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robert Englund, known better as the viciously manicured Freddy Krueger, is the 
Phantom in the just-released production, which was shot in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Phantom mania is here, what with the eternal Andrew Lloyd Webber spectacle 
(Schoelen hasn't seen it), an upcoming TV movie and yet another stage version 
due shortly in Los Angeles. It's not lost on Schoelen that this ubiquitousness 
is a plus for her project, though her feelings seem mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are wonderful things about it, and also great insecurities about it," 
says the actress with a laugh, her voice imbued with an appealing hoarseness. 
"I think to a certain degree, obviously, the name 'Phantom' is going to help. 
But also, I fear that there are a lot of people who don't know. . . . I think 
that a lot of people are thinking it's a musical." A musical it's not, Schoelen 
explains, as people are surely murdered in this film. 
</P>
<P>
Schoelen had intended to absorb other versions of the Gaston Leroux classic to 
assist her in interpreting the role. Ultimately, she ended up only seeing a 
couple of reels of the 1943 Claude Rains movie before deciding to scrap that 
approach and go with a fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Preconceived ideas, you know, they'll just screw you up every time," says 
Schoelen, laughing again. DAVID PECCHIA

FACES: ROKER: NOT ABOUT GLAMOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roxie Roker, glamour-puss, is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not about glamour," says the statuesque actress of her stage role in 
Samm-Art Williams' "Woman From the Town" at Inner City Cultural Center. "It's 
not about vanity. And I rather welcome it." Roker, who played the very chic 
Helen Willis for 11 seasons on "The Jeffersons," is here a worn-out, worn-down 
Southern farmer who clomps around in overalls, mud boots and bandanna -- with 
not a speck of makeup, tirelessly plowing her late father's fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to get up for the play," she says of the anger-filled, emotionally 
demanding role. "When I finish it, I feel -- cleansed is not the word. You 
start out saying, 'Why do I put myself through this?' But when you decide this 
is what you want to do, you just do it. So any opportunity I get, I want to do. 
I'm from New York; we do a lot of off-Broadway. We like making plays. Not that 
we don't want to be successful and make big bucks, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After an early acting start at her all-girls school ("I played the male roles 
because I was tall and had a deep voice"), Roker went on to a drama degree from 
Howard University, Elizabethan studies at Stratford-on-Avon and stage roles in 
"The Blacks," "Jamimma," and "The River Niger" -- for which she won an Obie. 
</P>
<P>
But the actress' biggest fame of late has been her family ties: as mother to 
up-and-coming musician Lenny Kravitz, mother-in-law to famous Cosby kid Lisa 
Bonet and grandmother to their year-old daughter Zoe. "I know how to separate 
my personal and professional lives," she says lightly. "And keeping (the fame) 
in the family is fine. Zoe is gorgeous, precious, just a joy. Lenny is 
thoughtful and considerate, Lisa is a wonderful mother. Forget about all that 
stuff you read in the papers." JANICE ARKATOV

THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC: MEMORIES OF HOROWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you, Martin Bernheimer and Charles Champlin, for the beautiful articles 
about Vladimir Horowitz on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
After I graduated from high school in New York in 1945, my parents and I spent 
the summer at a resort called Mt. Washington. Among the guests were Horowitz 
and Wanda Toscanini, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Volodya, as we called him, was a cut-up. We teased him because of his many 
fears. His eyes would pop in partly mock panic at the thought of a possible 
encounter with a bobcat on the trails. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6, Volodya greeted us with a panic-stricken face, saying the radio news 
had told of a "beeeg bomb" being dropped on Japan. We all laughed because he 
had on the funny expression he did when talking of the bobcat. It took a while 
for us to realize something of a very different nature had happened. 
</P>
<P>
My memory of Horowitz is forever linked with that lovely summer, and that of 
the A-bomb is forever linked to Horowitz.

HARRELL, OHYAMA WITH PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program for the fifth week of subscription concerts at the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic looked only mildly inviting on paper. It was an agenda, led by 
Philharmonic assistant conductor Heiichiro Ohyama, consisting of an Elegy by 
American composer Samuel Adler, Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto (played by 
Lynn Harrell) and Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique." 
</P>
<P>
At the first performance Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the 
Music Center, however, mildness was nowhere in evidence. Ohyama and the 
orchestra delivered a powerful reading of Berlioz's familiar masterpiece; 
cellist Harrell and his colleagues plumbed the sometimes-neglected depths of 
the E-flat Concerto, and the brief Adler piece started off the proceedings in 
serious vein. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, what started the evening was most serious: a tribute, via a recording 
of Vladimir Horowitz's playing of Schumann's "Traumerei," to the late pianist. 
This seemed to set the tone of this satisfying concert, since it put in a 
larger perspective the emotional range of the three works to come. 
</P>
<P>
Most polished was the "Symphonie Fantastique," in a sweeping and admirably 
detailed account which moved logically and with apprehendable continuity from 
first to last. All choirs of the orchestra rose to what seemed a special 
occasion, and the solo lines emerged with particular passion -- especially 
those of clarinetist Michele Zukovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell's touching and virtuosic performance of the First Cello Concerto turned 
out not to be the usual, heart-on-sleeve reading many soloists produce, but one 
more thoughtful, more self-restrained and ultimately more memorable. 
</P>
<P>
The progress of feeling outlined in the work is thus detailed, nuance by 
nuance, the accumulation of strong emotions building, through the piece, to the 
final cadence. Paradoxically -- or perhaps not so paradoxically -- the lack of 
grandstanding from the solo cellist resulted here in a triumph for the 
composer. Ohyama and the Philharmonic supported Harrell's concept thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Strong feelings in miniature are the product in Adler's brief, pointed and 
atonal Elegy for strings, a work written in 1962 after the death of Marjorie 
Fulton Harrell, the mother of Lynn Harrell, in an auto accident.

ROLLINS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Rollins, co-star of the NBC police series "In the Heat of the Night," 
was released from an Atlanta hospital Friday after passing a stress test for 
chest pains he suffered on the set of the show, MGM/UA Television announced. 
</P>
<P>
The studio released a statement from Crawford Long Hospital saying that there 
was no evidence of coronary artery blockage. Rollins, 37, who stars in the 
series with Carroll O'Connor, earlier passed EKG and heart blood tests for the 
pains that caused him to be hospitalized Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA spokesman Kim Reed said Rollins was expected to return soon to the show.

ROBERT HILBURN: ALTERNATIVE POP TUNES EMBODY ACCESSIBILITY, CRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Variety is the key to a healthy pop music diet -- and that's the emphasis of 
this installment of the Alternative Top 10, a periodic guide to the best new 
singles and album tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The list is headed by four recordings that encompass so much accessibility and 
craft that they are likely to be actual Top 10 singles in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the list, however, centers chiefly on artists who work in styles 
that may be a bit too quirky for the kind of mass radio exposure that is 
required to be a national hit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is these records -- by newcomers with such offbeat names as Shakespear's 
Sister, 3rd Bass and Eat -- that not only give character and seasoning to our 
pop fare, but also help shape the changes that are essential to stretching the 
music's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Alternative Top 10 doesn't automatically exclude records in the actual 
Billboard magazine Top 10, but the focus is on tracks by new acts or by artists 
that often get shunned by radio's mainstream pop formats. 
</P>
<P>
The November choices: 
</P>
<P>
1. Terence Trent D'Arby's "I'll Be Alright" (Columbia) -- This tale of romantic 
celebration is a knockout mix of Sam Cooke soul and Beach Boys good cheer. A 
simply irresistible track from his new "Neither Fish Nor Flesh" album. 
</P>
<P>
2. Tracy Chapman's "Subcity" (Elektra) -- "Crossroads," an unnecessarily dour 
statement of independence and integrity, is the first single from the 
folk-accented artist's second album, but the more natural successor to "Fast 
Car" is this tuneful reflection on society's neglected underclass. 
</P>
<P>
3. Aerosmith's "Janie's Got a Gun" (Geffen) -- The frisky "Love in an Elevator" 
is the first hit from the veteran rock group's "Pump" album, but this dramatic 
portrait of a child abuse victim will probably become an even more important 
part of the band's repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
4. Soul II Soul's "Back to Life" (Virgin) -- Another classy and imaginative 
dance-floor soundscape from the London team that gave us "Keep on Movin'." 
</P>
<P>
5. 3rd Bass' "Steppin to the A.M." (Def Jam) -- Sturdy rhymes and snappy beats 
from the first white rap outfit from Def Jam since the Beastie Boys. 
</P>
<P>
6. Shakespear's Sister's "You're History" (FFRR Records/Polydor) -- Though this 
kind of novelty wears out quickly, the delightfully absurd put-down of an old 
lover is too much fun to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
7. Adult Net's "Waking Up in the Sun" (Fontana/Mercury) -- Brix Smith, a Los 
Angeles native no less, is best known for her work with English cult faves the 
Fall, but the singer-songwriter is concentrating now on her own group Adult 
Net. 
</P>
<P>
8. Eat's "Skin" (Fiction/Mercury) -- A wickedly satiric slap at a small-town 
fat cat, from a British band signed to the Cure's record label, built around an 
anxious, evil-eye swamp rock arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
9. Mekons' "Memphis, Egypt" (Twin/Tone/A&amp;M) -- There's a lot of the Clash's 
independent spirit in this veteran English group, so it's only natural that the 
Mekons would borrow a bit of rock dynamics from Mott the Hoople, a band that 
was a favorite of the Clash's Mick Jones. 
</P>
<P>
10. Steve Stevens' "Action" (Warner Bros.) -- Time out for a little '70s 
nostalgia. Billy Idol's former guitarist salutes the wonderfully energetic 
Sweet with a version of that old British group's 1976 hit.

Patricia Hoffmann thinks she has found a niche to be filled in the local dance 
scene. Young dancers who are somewhere between the student and professional 
level need a platform on which to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann realizes she's fighting several factors, including paltry support for 
home-grown dance troupes and a paucity of male dancers, but she's got 
confidence in Jazzart Dance Company. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the newest troupe of her West Coast Ballet will debut with a pair 
of performances at La Jolla High School's Parker Auditorium. Curtain times are 
2:30 and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Hoffman, the former director of the defunct San Diego Ballet, explained 
in an interview last week, Jazzart harbors no lofty goals for professional 
status -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a training ground to give opportunities to choreographers and 
teen-age students," she said. "Most dancers will still leave (when they 
mature), and the best I feel we can do is to give them experience. 
</P>
<P>
That's not really different from the other dance companies around, she said. 
"We're just one of the first ones to acknowledge what we are. We're not calling 
it a professional company, just a well-trained one." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hoffman's description of the fledgling ensemble, "Jazzart is 
primarily a jazz group, but all our students study ballet, and some study 
modern and tap." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, for Jazzart's maiden concert, Hoffman has enlisted a strong cadre 
of nine choreographers to create a slate of works that will show off her 
aspiring dancers in all their diversity. 
</P>
<P>
This something-for-everyone show will feature jazz, compliments of Los 
Angeles-based Jimmy Locust (whose credits include working with Michael 
Jackson), contemporary ballet in Mieczyslaw (Misha) Morawski's upbeat mode, and 
a taste of Lorna Diamond's brand of classical ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the roster is Pam Thompson's tap-happy work, a raucous rhythm piece for 
the entire company, and a modern dance by Three's Company's Terri Shipman. 
</P>
<P>
Guest artist Cameron English will wear two hats at this coming-out concert. The 
former member of TV's "Fame" show and featured dancer in the film version of "A 
Chorus Line," will strut his stuff in a jazzy solo. His dance designs for eight 
dancers are also on the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be about 28 kids and adults in the show," Hoffman said, "but this 
is definitely not a school recital. We only have three men in the company, but 
all the dancers are really coming along. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't do justice to a professional company," she acknowledged. "This is 
a semiprofessional youth company, and we're living up to that. We'll have to 
impress (the public) before we can build it up any further."

Protea species 
</P>
<P>
Protea 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen shrubs with spectacular flowers 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protea flowers are flown in from Hawaii every day, displayed in 
fancy florist shops and eagerly purchased by patrons of beauty willing to shell 
out $6 to $18 per stem. 
</P>
<P>
Proteas last for two weeks in a vase if the water is changed and a bit of stem 
cut off daily. If you want them to last even longer, hang them upside down for 
several days until they dry out completely; dried proteas can be used in 
bouquets or holiday wreaths; no one will be blase about such a gift. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular is Protea cynaroides, the king protea, which has wide-open 
petals, often pink and white, around a center mound. Other varieties in 
assorted colors have petals that fold in tightly. Pink Mink (P. neriifolia), 
another favorite with the floral trade, doesn't open up but keeps a cylindrical 
shape; it comes in green and a dark, moody pink with black petal tips. 
</P>
<P>
Related species, all members of the Proteaceae family, include Banksia, 
Leucodendron and Leucospermum, all with eye-popping flowers. And these are just 
a few of the color and shape variations. Proteas, native to South Africa and 
Australia, have been compared to thistles, artichoke flowers, even bird 
feathers, but this is a futile exercise; proteas are uniquely beautiful. And, 
if you can find them in nurseries, they are in bloom right now. 
</P>
<P>
Protea growers in Southern California recommend planting the shrubs in sandy or 
gravelly soil (preferably on a slope) in a sunny location where they won't get 
much water or attention -- or nutrients. Smaller proteas (some of the larger 
ones can reach 12 feet in height) can be grown in large tubs with a very acid 
soil mix similar to that for azaleas. 
</P>
<P>
Proteas in the ground should be watered once a week during the first year and 
thereafter during hot summers, and every two weeks (or not at all) during 
winter and spring. (The general rule: Never water a protea unless it's dry.) 
Plants in containers, of course, dry out faster. And while most proteas are 
frost-tender, several species can survive temperatures as low as 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Proteas are difficult to grow from seed and almost as difficult to find as 
plants, although their popularity is growing. Seeds are available from Thompson 
&amp; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527; five seeds cost $4.45. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Nursery &amp; Florist in San Gabriel stocks proteas in five-gallon 
cans for $29. Walter Anderson Nursery in San Diego sells two-gallon sleeves for 
$7.99 and up, and Turk Hessellund Nursery in Montecito carries proteas in 
4-inch pots, 2-gallon sleeves, 5-gallon pots and 15-gallon containers. Prices 
range from $7.50 to $100. JUDITH SIMS

IKEBANA'S LIVING SCULPTURE: THE THEATRICALITY OF NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA TYSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people think of ikebana as those spare, artistic flower arrangements posed 
delicately as a table centerpiece or lovingly in a small vase. But as devotees 
of the Sogetsu School will tell you, ikebana can take more monumental forms. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just something you put on a coffee table. It doesn't just disappear 
into the living room decor," says Don Davidson, who has studied Sogetsu ikebana 
for 15 years. "I do mostly large arrangements. It's not unusual for my 
arrangements to be six to eight feet high or eight to 10 feet long." 
</P>
<P>
For Davidson, who has designed floats for the Tournament of Roses parade for 34 
years, part of the appeal is the grandness and theatricality he puts into his 
ikebana designs. But it's also the opportunity to work with nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in the Cascade Mountains in Washington state and always had a great 
love of nature and the seasons," Davidson says. "I was always drawn to nature, 
and to play with nature in ikebana is a great joy." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson will be among those ikebana fanciers providing examples ranging in 
size from medium to extremely large at the Sogetsu Ikebana Flower Arrangement 
Show today and Sunday at South Coast Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the audience will see the many ways materials can be used besides just 
putting materials in a vase," says Tomi Maeno, who has studied Sogetsu ikebana 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
While the exact beginnings of ikebana are not known, it is believed to have 
derived from the custom of dedicating flowers to the Buddha, which began when 
Buddhism was brought to Japan in the 6th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The Sogetsu School, one of the three largest ikebana schools in Japan today, 
was founded in 1927 by the late Sofu Teshigahara, who believed that ikebana 
should be both enjoyable and creative. Teshigahara had trained from childhood 
in the tradition of flower arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Sogetsu was the first (school) to follow a less rigid code and stress 
originality," Maeno says. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain schools are known for certain types of arrangements -- some for being 
traditional or formal, while others emphasize natural quality of plant 
materials. Ours is well known for being more abstract -- more modern -- which 
blends in well with the modern architecture in Japan and in many homes." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sogetsu group works on larger ikebana that are displayed in 
area banks and hotels, including the New Otani Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sogetsu instructor Yokou Kitajima regularly creates arrangements that may be 
displayed up to six months in the hotel's lobby, and replaces the flower 
components as needed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Maeno says, at the time of Emperor Hirohito's death in January, 
the hotel's arrangement featured red flowers -- inappropriate during a time of 
mourning. So Kitajima replaced them with white blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Kitajima, who has been with the Los Angeles branch for 10 years, received his 
ikebana training in Japan. He is one of the few male instructors in the United 
States, a reversal of the Japanese arrangements, Maeno says, where men dominate 
the ranks of masters and instructors. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," says designer Davidson, "because of my sculptural background, I treat 
ikebana as sculpture in plant material, and even non-plant material, but we 
always try to get the plant material in there somewhere. If you use tree 
trunks, logs or branches, it will last indefinitely as a piece of sculpture. In 
Japan, there is no distinct line between sculpture and ikebana. Many of the 
ikebana masters in Japan do fabulous sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you get into the very abstract, there is no definite dividing line, 
especially since in Japan ikebana is an art form recognized on the same level 
as sculpture or painting." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson notes that while it takes a long time to master ikebana, students show 
results immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Instruction is geared in such a way that you learn specific do's and don'ts 
and if you follow instructions carefully, you cannot do a bad ikebana," 
Davidson says. 
</P>
<P>
Sogetsu instruction includes learning to handle and "condition" materials 
through cuts with boiling water, alcohol or sake. The conditioning, Davidson 
notes, will help preserve the work longer than normal flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that ikebana stresses originality, not competition. "One of the 
big differences with ikebana is that shows are never judged. No one ever 
selects one arrangement over another. We encourage people who are just 
beginning to participate in shows. 
</P>
<P>
"At a show, some arrangements will overwhelm you and you may think, 'I could 
never to that,' but then you'll look around the corner and see something simple 
and think, 'Well, I could do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to be overwhelmed or inspired by ikebana of the Sogetsu School, 
you have two opportunities this weekend. The Yeojin Flower Arrangement Club 
Show, which opened Friday, continues today from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Descanso 
Gardens, La Canada Flintridge. The Sogetsu Ikebana Flower Arrangement Show is 
today and Sunday at South Coast Botanic Garden, Palos Verdes Peninsula. The 
hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the ikebana shows is included in the general admission to the 
gardens: $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and 75 cents for children 5 to 12. 
For information about the Yeojin show at Descanso Gardens, call (818) 790-5571; 
for the Sogetsu show at South Coast (213) 544-1948.

<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Ask a nurseryman now for the correct spray to use on your dormant plants to 
control pests and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Plant cyclamen for an endless show of color during the coolest and wettest 
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Keep those annuals you planted last month well watered and be sure to feed them 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
House plants need less water as the days get shorter and skies grow dimmer, 
especially those in plastic pots (which don't breathe like clay pots); keep an 
eye on those near the fireplace or heater, though.

PHILADELPHIA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At recess time at St. Edmond's parochial school in south Philadelphia, the 
youngsters crowd around to watch blue-uniformed volunteers from the 
Philadelphia Youth Service Corps swarm over the 75-year-old structure, painting 
the trim and patching the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"The building looks wonderful," says Sister Nancy Marie Firn, the principal. 
"But the best thing about this is that it gives the children a chance to see 
people working together to help someone else." 
</P>
<P>
In a rudimentary way, the 2-year-old Youth Service Corps is a testing ground 
for a nationwide scheme that would be much more ambitious -- and has turned out 
to be far more controversial -- than similar programs here and in other big 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats in Congress are proposing to channel the energies and skills of 
young people into federal social programs by enlisting them in a national 
"citizen corps" of perhaps 500,000 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal's sponsors, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Rep. Dave McCurdy of 
Oklahoma, are promoting it as a new approach to government activism in an age 
of big deficits and tight budgets. Not incidentally, they are also seeking to 
pump new life into their political party. 
</P>
<P>
Though some of the plan's backers see a concept as unassailable as motherhood, 
it has touched off fierce opposition and raised the fundamental question of how 
much Americans now can realistically expect from their government -- and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
The breadth of opposition to the proposal and the range of epithets used 
against it may represent some sort of unofficial record. 
</P>
<P>
Among liberals, Rep. William D. Ford (D-Mich.) called the approach "reminiscent 
of Stalinist industrialization in the 1930s." Conservative critics recalled 
that economist Milton Friedman once likened a version of the national service 
concept to the Hitler Youth. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials fear that a citizen corps would complicate recruiting for 
the armed forces. And the War Resisters League branded the idea as "coercive" 
and "a guise for the return of a draft." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the organized left and the organized right who are against it," Nunn 
said. "The left basically wants everything to be in addition to, not instead 
of" current government benefits. "The right doesn't want government involved in 
a big way in people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
The citizen corps was first proposed early this year under the aegis of the 
Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of party moderates, as a way to 
advance its goal of moving the Democrats toward the middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a guaranteed benefit, it's a guaranteed opportunity," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the GI Bill, the program would offer tangible benefits -- tuition payments 
and housing assistance -- in return for service. It would also phase out most 
other forms of federal aid to college students. 
</P>
<P>
As the program was originally contemplated, volunteers for civilian service 
would receive a $10,000 voucher in return for a year of work in education, 
health care, conservation or public safety. They could use the voucher toward 
college tuition or a down payment on a home. 
</P>
<P>
Under another option, a recruit could choose military service and get $12,000 a 
year. The cost of the program has been estimated at $5 billion a year even 
after most current federal education aid programs were phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates say that what distinguishes the citizen corps and gives it political 
potency is that it would reach middle-class youth, much as the Peace Corps has, 
while other youth programs have been aimed mainly at lower-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown called the Nunn-McCurdy measure "the 
first major new social program that has been advanced in Congress in well over 
15 years. We are talking about a government program that will make this nation 
better by reestablishing a special relationship and responsibility between our 
government and its people." 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most serious and intense objections to the proposal have been 
stirred by the idea of replacing most federal aid to education with the option 
of earning part of tuition costs as a citizen-volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nunn-McCurdy bill is based on the false premise that access to education 
beyond high school should be a privilege for the few who have 'earned' it, as 
reward for their public service," wrote Ford, a senior member of the House 
Education and Labor Committee. "The reality is that we need to 'give' as much 
education as we can to as many students as are willing to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Education and Labor 
Committee, said: "They are attempting to take money away from the school aid 
program, and we don't want to interfere with that group of students." 
</P>
<P>
McCurdy says that the opposition the proposal is encountering is symptomatic of 
many politicians' current determination to avoid responsibility for the cost of 
benefit programs and other government services. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Ronald) Reagan Administration for eight years gave us no pain and easy 
answers," he said. "The Democrats are afraid to touch entitlement programs." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the bill modified the original proposal by making it possible for 
volunteers to serve in the corps while going to school. It would also allow 
current federal aid programs to continue for young people with disabilities or 
heavy financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"The only young person who would fare more poorly under national service than 
under existing programs," Nunn said during a Senate hearing, "would be an 
able-bodied high school graduate with no disabilities or other compelling 
personal circumstances who simply did not want to perform any service 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
In answer to critics of the proposed phase-out of current federal programs, 
Nunn-McCurdy backers say that earnings from the national service in most cases 
would exceed amounts available through federal grants, and that national 
service would offer financial support to the estimated 50% of American youth 
who now do not attend college. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of national service say they are encouraged by the success of local 
volunteer programs such as the Philadelphia Youth Service Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is that service programs can work, particularly that we can manage 
programs with low-income kids," said Charles C. Moskos, a Northwestern 
University sociologist who is one of the driving forces behind the Nunn-McCurdy 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
If the Youth Service Corps here is any indication, one key to success is a 
tough, no-nonsense approach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a hard program and a demanding one," instructor Ann Kreidle told a 
group of new recruits, all high school dropouts, some fresh from scrapes with 
the law. "You've got to get here every day, and you've got to get here on time. 
If you are ready to do that, fine. If not, we don't want you." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Daryl Hinton said that only about half of each incoming group makes 
it through training, and that staff members continue to weed out 
"knuckleheads." 
</P>
<P>
One such troublemaker was 18-year-old Chris Dozier, who was suspended for 
writing on the wall at his job site but was given the chance to go through 
training again. Asked why he had returned, Dozier, who first joined the corps 
after he was arrested for his involvement in a gang fight, said: "So I can 
better my hopes for the future. They gave me a second chance to get my life 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Fairbanks, executive director of the corps, said he considers it "an 
embryonic version of a national service corps," but he doubts that Congress 
will approve the Nunn-McCurdy proposal, with its phase-out of existing 
education programs, any time soon. "There is no way in hell the education lobby 
is going to let that happen," Fairbanks said. 
</P>
<P>
For all their accomplishments, the Philadelphia corps and similar service 
programs in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland 
have difficulty attracting middle-class youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the low compensation they offer, usually minimum wage or less. 
Another, said Northwestern's Moskos, "is that they lack the glamour of an 
organization like the Peace Corps." 
</P>
<P>
For youngsters from low-income families, on the other hand, the urban corps 
programs -- which include courses and other help -- offer the prospect of 
getting the equivalence of high school diplomas, which many lack. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Kong, director of the New York City Volunteer Corps, the biggest such 
program in the country, acknowledged that only "a small number" of her 450 
volunteers are middle class, and that 75% of them are high school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
The low-income volunteers generally get high marks for their conscientiousness 
and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
At Chinatown Day Care Center in Manhattan, about 10 City Volunteer Corps 
members who serve as teachers' aides were busy last Halloween showing young 
witches and goblins how to bob for apples. "They are a big help," teacher 
Victoria Mangubat said of her aides. "The children respect them because they 
know how to discipline them." 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes their limited experience and education are handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Simmons, a college-educated former Peace Corps volunteer who is team 
supervisor for the volunteer contingent at the Chinatown center, said that the 
volunteers could accomplish more and have a bigger impact on the children "if 
their skill levels and abilities were higher." 
</P>
<P>
Low-income volunteers probably would be more effective and their experience 
would be more gratifying if they were teamed with better-educated volunteers, 
Moskos said. That would be a goal of the Nunn-McCurdy proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with middle-class kids usually helps lower-income kids raise their 
performance level," Moskos said. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class volunteers would also benefit from a diverse experience, said the 
Philadelphia corps' Fairbanks. "Both middle-class and lower-class kids have 
much to 
</P>
<P>
learn from each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of national service initially welcomed President Bush's early 
emphasis on volunteerism -- what he calls his "thousand points of light" -- 
because it would help focus attention on the idea of service. 
</P>
<P>
But some have come to view Bush's "YES" proposal, for Youth Entering Service, 
as a hindrance. The White House has yet to spell out details of his proposal, 
and some Republicans seem reluctant to act on any kind of service measure until 
they know what the President has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
From what is known, Bush's proposal would seek only about $25 million in 
federal funds to establish a foundation to promote community service. 
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) for support of service 
programs run through schools, is included in a Senate bill that was approved 
last summer by the Kennedy-chaired Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
The bill would also provide $100 million to start and expand local youth 
service corps programs. 
</P>
<P>
And still another section of the Senate bill, inspired by the Nunn-McCurdy 
proposal, would provide an additional $100 million for state-administered, 
five-year demonstrations of the national service corps approach. Volunteers 
would be eligible to receive vouchers good for buying homes or paying tuition, 
though other types of educational aid would continue. 
</P>
<P>
The House Education and Labor Committee is expected to produce its own national 
service bill this month. McCurdy says he hopes for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"With the pilot program, we can allow states to demonstrate that it can 
actually work," he said. "Then, I think, there will be a a move to supporting 
it. I'm not discouraged. When you go outside (Washington area), there is a lot 
of support for it."

JOYFUL REUNIONS AS BORDERS OPEN

<P>
It was like a national family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
There were tears, smiles and scenes of unrestrained joy, mixed with disbelief 
that what was happening was really happening. 
</P>
<P>
After three decades as the industrialized world's most penned-in people, East 
Germans suddenly learned that they were free to come and go as they pleased. 
</P>
<P>
And they did. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 24 hours after the Communist regime threw open its borders, more 
than 70,000 East Germans passed through what had been the Iron Curtain and 
crossed into West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hirschberg checkpoint north of Nuremberg, traffic was backed up for 
nearly 40 miles at times Friday, and there were long waits at all other 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
At the Helmstedt crossing, as at other points along the 860-mile frontier, West 
Germans lined the road to cheer and wave as East Germans in little Trabant and 
Wartburg cars sputtered across to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Years of being forbidden to travel have produced a kind of national neurosis in 
East Germany. They call it fernweh -- wanderlust, a longing to travel. Fernweh 
was clearly demonstrated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans cheered and applauded in their cars as they left their 
homeland for the first time. One shouted, "Finally! Finally!" 
</P>
<P>
Coming to a land that most had seen only on their television screens, the East 
Germans were received as long-lost relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans pressed 10-mark notes (about $6) into the hands of East 
Germans as they entered the country. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles into West Germany, small groups of people stood along the 
highways and on overpasses, waving at East German cars as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, Mayor Walter Momper told a crowd of people, "We Germans are the 
happiest people on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
In a country that has experienced few such moments of joy in this century, it 
was an experience unlikely to be forgotten. Indeed, some people have already 
suggested that Nov. 9, the day the border was opened, should be made the German 
national day. At present, West Germans celebrate on June 17, the date of the 
brief uprising in East Germany in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
In Helmstedt, the main square and pedestrian shopping areas were crowded with 
Germans, East and West, talking and smiling and gesturing animatedly. For 
Germans on both sides of the border, it was a day of celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the East Germans were from frontier areas so close that they were once 
within the Helmstedt city limits. On Friday, they stood in the main square for 
the first time, dazed, excited, dumbstruck. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe this is happening," a young East German foundry worker 
said, clinging to his wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've hoped for this for 40 years," Helmstedt City Manager Lothar Wien said. 
"Relatives who live only a few miles from each other can actually visit. It's 
hard to describe the depth of feeling in all this. It's a huge reunion." 
</P>
<P>
Where words failed, gestures sometimes made the point. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans returning to hastily, illegally parked cars in Helmstedt's main 
square found marigolds instead of tickets under their windshield wipers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who looked into the Ratskeller restaurant next to the town hall found it 
hard to get away. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't buy a drink in here," the manager, Werner Dyga, said. 
</P>
<P>
At the town hall, East Germans collected 100 marks in "welcome money," the 
equivalent of $60, then gaped at the brightly lit affluence of the new world 
that surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the East Germans came briefly, apparently to test their new freedom, as 
if pinching themselves to make sure it wasn't all some cruel joke. 
</P>
<P>
Those who shopped bought carefully, as if they planned to return. 
</P>
<P>
A young East German office manager, asked what he had bought, replied, 
"Bananas, grapefruit and something colorful for my children." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 8,500 East Germans who crossed at Helmstedt, only 500 asked for 
permanent resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to open the borders was viewed as a final, desperate gamble on the 
part of an East German government on the edge of collapse. In the knowledge 
that 1.4 million East Germans had already applied to emigrate before Thursday's 
dramatic move, West German authorities braced themselves for the possibility of 
an enormous exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The 175,000 to 200,000 East Germans who fled in the eight weeks before 
Thursday's move have placed a severe strain on West Germany's ability to house 
and provide jobs for the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in some cities, including Frankfurt and Hanover, have said they are 
unable to absorb additional newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've only come for the day," said Irena Tuerk, a Magdeburg schoolteacher, 
moments after she set foot in the West for the first time. "My grandson has to 
be in school in the morning." The child was in the back seat of her car. 
</P>
<P>
At first, East German authorities had insisted that people traveling to the 
West have a special police stamp on their identity cards. But by early 
afternoon, the people coming in said they had been passed through with no 
formalities. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials expect an even greater number of East German travelers 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Wien said he had approved a request from Magdeburg, East Germany's 
fourth-largest city, to operate a bus service to Helmstedt starting today.

THE WALL CRUMBLES; 
</P>
<P>
GREAT ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of people defied the Berlin Wall's concrete, barbed wire, guards and 
automatic machine guns during its 28-year history. As many as 40,000 escaped. 
Most of these, 25,428, fled in the first 14 weeks after the wall was built, 
until Christmas, 1961. One hundred or more died -- most shot by East German 
border guards, according to officials at the Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie. 
Some of the most daring escapes: 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, 1961, five people escaped in an old Opel four-seat car that was so 
heavy with scrap-metal armor plating it could hardly move. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas, 1961, 81-year-old East Berlin truck driver Erwin Becker, digging 
alone, had completed a 100-foot tunnel from a basement close to the wall. He 
led 28 people to freedom, then returned and organized another tunnel-digging 
group. They started from his small garden near the border. Becker was by then 
too weak to dig, but he stood guard, and all got out. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1962, 29 young people escaped through "Tunnel 29," dug starting 
from West Berlin and running 395 feet. Solidly built, the tunnel could have 
been used for a long time but was flooded when a water pipe burst. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, six people were brought out, one at a time, by contorting themselves 
into a minuscule space created by removing the heater and manifold of an 
Isetta, a tiny three-wheeled car. 
</P>
<P>
The night of March 30-31, 1983, two men on the eastern side of the wall shot an 
arrow -- the tip weighted with steel and trailing a thin nylon wire -- to a 
lower rooftop in the west. A helper on the western side then hauled a stronger 
steel wire across and the two men slid across on pulleys. 
</P>
<P>
A girl in West Berlin made an imitation U.S. Army uniform, obtaining buttons 
and insignia by saying they were for a theater production. She borrowed a Ford 
sedan, stole U.S. military license plates and drove to East Berlin, bringing 
back two friends who were engaged to marry. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, another young woman made Soviet Army uniforms for three male 
student friends. They were respectfully saluted by East German border guards 
when they drove over to West Berlin, the girl hiding in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Klaus Brueske became a hero when he used his truck to smash 
through a frontier barrier and bring out family and friends. He was shot and 
fatally wounded but kept driving until safely across. 
</P>
<P>
"Tunnel 57," also named for the number of escapees, was the longest of all at 
475 feet. It was also 39 feet underground at one point. It was dug by 36 
students in 10 months from a toilet outhouse in East Berlin to a closed bakery 
on the western side. 
</P>
<P>
East German security forgot about a sewer leading from Gleinstrasse in East 
Berlin to the western side, and more than 100 people used it before it was 
discovered -- when an 18-year-old girl lacked the strength to replace the 
manhole cover. 
</P>
<P>
At the Luisen cemetery, students dug down through a grave, using the gravestone 
to hide the entrance to their tunnel. About 200 people made it out before the 
route was discovered by guards who noticed an empty baby carriage next to the 
grave.

BUSH SHEDS HIS CAUTION, CITING PROOF OF REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: THE PRESIDENT SEES NEXT MONTH'S SUMMIT WITH GORBACHEV AS EVEN MORE 
SIGNIFICANT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shedding the cautious tone he adopted only a day earlier, President Bush said 
Friday that East Germany's decision to open its borders proves that the force 
of political reform in Eastern Europe is real and "deserves our continued 
encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the National Assn. of Realtors in Dallas, Bush said that his 
Mediterranean summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month 
"takes on even more importance than when I conceived the idea." 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in fascinating times," the President said, "and we will seize 
every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to extend democracy. And 
in doing so, I will conduct the foreign policy of this great country with the 
prudence that these fascinating times -- times of change -- demand, and with 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments were considerably less measured than his earlier observations 
about events in East Germany. And they underscored the importance of the summit 
at sea on warships off the island of Malta on Dec. 2 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
When the Administration announced plans for the Bush-Gorbachev meeting a week 
ago, White House officials called it a preliminary get-together rather than a 
negotiating session intended to produce substantive decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The President did not elaborate on his comment that events in East Germany and 
the rest of Eastern Europe would make the summit more important. But Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III said that Bush and Gorbachev will "share respective 
viewpoints" on the fast-developing situation. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, interviewed on the ABC-TV program "Good Morning, America," added, "The 
purpose of this pre-summit meeting between President Gorbachev and President 
Bush is not to sit around a table and talk about dividing up in any way Eastern 
Europe or the future of Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Major Impact 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it seems unlikely that the superpower leaders could conduct 
face-to-face talks without either adopting joint measures to assure stability 
in Eastern Europe or failing to do so. Either way, the summit would have a 
major impact on the region. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush spoke by telephone 
Friday with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He said the two men had said 
the Mediterranean meeting has taken on added significance and that they had 
agreed to consult closely in the weeks preceding the session. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush should be very careful at the summit not to sign anything that his staff 
hasn't parsed thoroughly," said George Carver, who was deputy CIA director when 
Bush headed the agency in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has to be very careful not to be mousetrapped into doing something that 
has not been thought through thoroughly or, conversely, to be put into a 
position where he appears to be the only obstructionist," Carver said. "Bush is 
sitting down with a very heady chess player, a man who always thinks at least 
five moves ahead. We (Americans), by instinct, are not chess players." 
</P>
<P>
Since the day the Berlin Wall was built 28 years ago, U.S. officials have been 
demanding its destruction. But Administration officials now acknowledge that 
they are unprepared to deal with such sudden and dramatic success. 
</P>
<P>
"Were we surprised by the speed of it?" Baker asked. "You bet your life. And so 
was everybody else, as far as I can determine. I don't know anybody who's 
suggested that they predicted this was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Administration is struggling to devise a new strategy toward 
Eastern Europe. So far, U.S. policy-makers have taken a very cautious approach, 
with Bush warning that the possibility still exists of a crackdown on the 
reform movements by the region's Communist governments. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone Surprised 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a small group of reporters Thursday, Bush spoke of the 
"dramatic happening" in Eastern Europe and said that he is "elated." But he 
appeared reluctant to assess whether the reform effort will indeed be lasting. 
Friday's remarks indicated that the Administration's skepticism is waning. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes in recent months make clear that the process of reform initiated 
by the East Europeans and supported by Mr. Gorbachev and by America and by our 
allies is real, offers us all much hope (and) deserves our continued 
encouragement," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a speech at a political fund-raising dinner in Dallas, Bush seemed to 
back off a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we all look now with hope in our hearts at the amazing changes in 
Eastern Europe -- indeed in the Soviet Union itself -- with encouragement and 
hope," he said. "Yet this country must not and cannot base its foreign policy 
or its national security on the aspirations of one man inside the Soviet Union, 
or anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney added a note of caution in an interview with the 
Associated Press. "The opening of the (Berlin) wall, it's a major event, but 
it's important for us to think about what comes after that," Cheney said. "We 
need to digest these changes. Clearly we welcome them, but we have to be a 
little reserved about formulating major policy shifts until we have an 
opportunity to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Administration is coming under increasing pressure to take 
some action to reinforce the process of change. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress already have agreed 
that the United States should provide economic aid to the reformist governments 
in Poland and Hungary, although they have haggled over the proper amount. It 
seems likely that the U.S. government will at least consider extending 
assistance to East Germany as well. 
</P>
<P>
Some non-government experts are urging Bush to take steps that would support 
Gorbachev's Soviet reforms and reward him for permitting dramatic changes in 
Poland, Hungary and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"One should realize that the Soviets are quite serious," said Yahia Zoubir, 
professor of international relations at American University in Washington. 
"What they have allowed in East Germany proves their sincerity. If we want to 
help Gorbachev, it's the time to do it. The Soviets have done all that they can 
do." 
</P>

California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), interviewed on NBC-TV's "Today Show," 
expressed similar sentiments. "I think we need to give tangible expressions of 
our support (to Gorbachev)," Lantos said. "Without Gorbachev, what we are 
seeing at the Berlin Wall would not be taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, interviewed on Cable News Network, agreed that East Germany would not 
have opened its borders "had the Soviets not tacitly approved it or called for 
it or welcomed it." But Baker stopped short of suggesting a conciliatory 
gesture from the West. Instead, he called on East Germany to follow up its 
relaxation of travel rules by conducting "open and free and fair democratic 
elections."

DAZED E. BERLINERS BROWSE IN WORLD OF LUXURY

<P>
East Berliners found themselves in a dazzling world of consumer luxury Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many had never been inside a Western shop. Others retained faint memories from 
before their Communist leaders shut them behind the Berlin Wall in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Allowed through the wall for the first time in 28 years, they wandered around 
West Berlin's best-known department store, the KaDeWe, with an air of dazed 
wonderment, accepting the free "welcome" cups of coffee offered only to them. 
</P>
<P>
As a special concession, KaDeWe, situated on the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm, 
was allowing them to pay in East German marks at the Western rate of 10 for one 
West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
As one packed elevator ascended inside the store, three East German boys could 
hardly contain their excitement as a recorded voice intoned the names of each 
department. 
</P>
<P>
When the doors opened to reveal a display of video recorders, televisions and 
radios, they burst through shouting "Technik! Technik!" (Technology! 
Technology!). 
</P>
<P>
KaDeWe sales staff said the electronic goods department was proving one of the 
big magnets for the East Berliners. 
</P>
<P>
Another was the candy department, where chocolates and other confections 
vanished rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Amazed East Berliners stood in the toiletry section, gazing at what to them was 
an incredible array of soaps and toothpastes. 
</P>
<P>
But the exchange rate was too much for most of the visitors. Everywhere in the 
store, strong Berlin accents could be heard saying, "I can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
"Leave it alone. Too expensive," one husband advised his wife as she ogled a 
whole smoked ham priced at 34.80 marks -- about $19. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant in the elegant cosmetics department also had little to report. 
"Nobody has paid for anything here in East (German) marks; it's probably too 
expensive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But for Gisela Leander and many like her, the lack of purchasing power was not 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old woman said she had started out for the West the first thing 
Friday morning from Wolfersdorf, just outside East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came to look, and that was wonderful enough," she explained, 
"especially just before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
She spoke enthusiastically of all the good things the East Berliners were being 
offered by their rich Western neighbors, ranging from free visits to museums 
and free public transport to price concessions on a number of other attractions 
</P>
<P>
She had already taken time during the visit to dash off a quick letter to 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn, suggesting that other West German cities could 
emulate West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'll simply take off one morning for Hamburg and have a look around 
there," she said, envisioning her next taste of Western exotica.

AFRIKANERS SEE SIGNS OF DOOM UNDER NEW POLICY;

SOUTH AFRICA: THE RIGHT WING DOES NOT BUY THE DREAM OF A PEACEFUL, MULTIRACIAL

<P>
All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord I cut them off. . . 
. They swarmed around me like bees, but they died out as quickly as burning 
thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Psalms 118:11-12 
</P>
<P>
In times of desperation, the white Afrikaner has always found solace and 
sustenance in his Bible, particularly in the Psalms, which he quotes from 
memory, and in prayer, for which he kneels daily. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand here as members of an assailed nation," the Rev. Jan Henrik Boshoff 
prayed recently, his head bowed over a well-thumbed Bible. "We call on your 
Holy Name against the heathens. Help us break down these heathen masses." 
</P>
<P>
In God's name, many of the descendants of South Africa's Afrikaner settlers 
today are seeking deliverance from their own vision of Apocalypse: a future 
without the protection of racial segregation, crushed beneath black majority 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
They see signs of doom everywhere as the government loosens its grip on 
peaceful protest, from the red flags of the outlawed South African Communist 
Party that fluttered with impunity over an unprecedented anti-government rally 
of 70,000 people in Soweto on a recent Sunday to the unmuzzled revolutionary 
rhetoric of black guerrilla leaders freed unconditionally last month from life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dangerous situation the government has allowed to develop," 
Andries Treurnicht, a pastor and leader of the Conservative Party, said 
recently. By allowing mass ANC protests, he added, "they are creating a climate 
of resistance -- and a climate of victory" for the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of President Frederik W. de Klerk's ardent supporters said that they 
felt uncomfortable with the open display of support at the Oct. 29 rally for 
the Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1960 along with its ally the African 
National Congress. (Some, but not all, leaders of the ANC are members of the 
Communist Party.) 
</P>
<P>
Amid De Klerk's promises to dismantle apartheid and share power with blacks, 
the country's estimated 1 million right-wing whites have become an increasingly 
important spoiler in the republic's dreams of a peaceful, multiracial future. 
</P>
<P>
Over their dinner tables, in their churches and around the monuments to their 
unbending spirit, rising in steel and stone on the veld, these white South 
Africans beseech the Lord to stop De Klerk from selling out to black Africans 
what they consider their birthright. 
</P>
<P>
And if it comes to it, as many believe it will, they say they are prepared and 
morally obliged to take up arms to protect the purity of Afrikaner culture from 
the "heathen masses." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of these whites, Mike Pentz, a Pretoria factory supervisor, 
bowed his head and nodded agreement with Boshoff's prayer. Pentz, a father of 
four, had one tattooed arm around the shoulders of his son, Coenraad, a blond 
9-year-old who, like his father, was wearing the khaki slacks and shirt favored 
by right-wing whites. 
</P>
<P>
"Today in South Africa, a white skin means nothing, and a black skin means 
everything," Pentz said later, expressing a view widely shared by 
conservatives. "Who built up this country, white people or black people?" 
</P>
<P>
The first Pentzes landed at Cape Town in 1721 from Europe and later joined 
Dutch- and French-descended settlers, known as Boers, in the Great Trek of 1835 
to escape British colonial rule of the Cape of Good Hope area. The trekkers 
established renegade republics in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, and many 
today fly the Vierkleur, the four-color flag of the first Boer republic, rather 
than the modern flag of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Afrikanerdom, a cultural and ethnic group unique to South Africa, has been 
split for seven years between those, such as government officials, who see 
blacks and whites sharing power in a united South Africa, and rightists who 
want to carve up the country so that blacks and whites can live in their own 
separate, sovereign nations. 
</P>
<P>
The factions seem to agree on one thing: Four decades of white-minority rule, 
in which 3 million Afrikaners and 2 million other whites have dominated 26 
million voteless blacks, must come to an end without sacrificing the Afrikaner 
language and culture. 
</P>
<P>
The way whites like Pentz see it, though, De Klerk and his predecessor, 
President Pieter W. Botha, caved in to international pressure and restive 
blacks. De Klerk, who argues that the country can be ruled by consensus rather 
than by black majority rule, is regarded as a traitor by some for removing some 
apartheid legislation from the books and easing restrictions on anti-apartheid 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"He's betrayed the Afrikaner people and is trying to drive us out of our 
country," Pentz said. "But we're not going to lie down and take it." 
</P>
<P>
That was why Pentz and more than 1,000 other whites gathered around a statue of 
bemedaled Afrikaner folk hero Paul Kruger in Pretoria's Church Square a few 
weeks ago to pray for divine intervention. Their concerns about the government 
had come to a head when protesting blacks surrounded Kruger's statue as police 
merely watched, obeying De Klerk's orders to allow peaceful protest. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk came under fire from the right last month for releasing 77-year-old 
Walter Sisulu and other black and Indian leaders of the ANC, and for allowing 
crowds carrying ANC flags to sing and dance in the streets to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been reluctant to ignore the far right, which has siphoned 
off much of the ruling National Party's traditional Afrikaner support. In fact, 
the Conservative Party collected 700,000 votes in the September parliamentary 
elections -- 30% of the total white tally and about half the Afrikaner vote. 
Conservative Party-controlled city councils have replaced the ruling National 
Party in dozens of towns in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative leaders believe that their support will increase as De Klerk edges 
toward talks with black leaders, because whites will begin to doubt that the 
government can protect a white minority from black domination. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Conservative Party voters are members of even more militant 
organizations, such as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) and the Boer 
Freedom Movement. The AWB has threatened to disrupt black protest, and 
right-wing attacks have increased in recent months in South Africa and 
Pretoria-ruled Namibia, where a U.N. independence plan is about to turn the 
territory over to black majority rule. Two AWB members were charged last month 
with a machine-gun and grenade attack on a U.N. office in Namibia, in which a 
Namibian security guard died. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's conservatives maintain they are not racist, although many 
consider blacks to be less sophisticated and less capable than whites. Instead, 
they consider themselves segregationists, believing that blacks and whites 
want, and were meant by God, to live separate lives under their own 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing against the black," said J. C. du Plessis, 67, a retired 
civil servant. "I'll help him. I won't begrudge him anything in life. Hell, 
I've spent thousands of rands in taxes to help him. But I don't want him in my 
schools or my home. I don't want to live with him." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of God's plan, the conservatives point to the biblical story of 
creation, underlining the words "after their own kind." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't read apartheid in the Bible, but I read about the diversity of God's 
people," said Prof. Carel W. H. Boshoff, a former missionary in South Africa's 
black townships and now head of the Afrikaner Volkswag, a conservative cultural 
organization. "And today we feel the whole Afrikaner culture is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
An enduring theme of the far-right movement, and one that is shared with very 
liberal whites, is that it is immoral for white South Africans to deny voting 
rights to blacks in order to maintain their privileged status. 
</P>
<P>
"It's paternalism, is what it is," said Suzette Booyens, a high school 
mathematics teacher in Pretoria. "We want to give blacks their own freedom, in 
their own country. We don't hate them. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we appear selfish, but we want to have our own culture for our own 
people," she added. "And the blacks want that, too." 
</P>
<P>
Booyens and many other like-minded whites back up those words by refusing to 
hire black servants, a rarity in a country where hundreds of thousands of black 
men and women toil as maids, nannies, drivers and gardeners for whites. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in working yourself and using your own people to work for you," said 
Booyens, whose family roots in South Africa go back 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
The specter that conservative whites most fear is the very thing that many 
Americans consider the key to their country's success: the melting pot of 
diverse cultures. And they support that argument by citing recent incidents of 
racial violence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put all these (black and white) cultures together and just put the 
lid on," said Booyens' husband, Danie, a 52-year-old consultant for white-owned 
businesses fending off black union organizers. "It will explode."

3 WHITE ANC MEMBERS GET 18 TO 25 YEARS FOR TERRORISM

A magistrate sentenced three white members of the outlawed African National 
Congress to jail terms of 18 to 25 years Friday for terrorism in connection 
with three bombings and the largest cache of illegal weapons ever seized in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who commit violence must be punished. This is inescapable," Pretoria 
Regional Magistrate W. J. van den Bergh said in sentencing South Africans 
Damian de Lange, 32; and Iain Hugh Robertson, 36, to 25 and 20 years 
respectively, and British citizen Susan Donelly, 24, to 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, a former schoolteacher, was restrained by police as he shouted "Long 
live the ANC!" after being sentenced, and supporters in a packed public gallery 
showered the three with yellow daisies. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid organizations condemned the length of the sentences as a blow to 
hopes for racial reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
The three were among a five-member ANC cell discovered May 8, 1988, during a 
raid on a farmhouse in the town of Broederstroom near Pretoria, police said. 
The fourth member evaded arrest while the fifth is thought to have turned 
state's witness and did not appear at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a cache of arms found during the raid was the largest consignment 
of illegal weapons ever seized and included a ground-to-air missile, automatic 
weapons and hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
De Lange, a former journalist with the defunct liberal newspaper Rand Daily 
Mail, and Robertson were convicted of 11 charges of terrorism. Donelly, also a 
former schoolteacher, was found guilty of 10 charges. 
</P>
<P>
All three pleaded guilty on June 12 to three bomb attacks, including an 
unsuccessful attempt to blow up a bus carrying soldiers. None of the attacks 
caused any injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Friday, the government lifted restrictions on the 
political activity of veteran ANC member Govan Mbeki, allowing him to speak 
publicly for the first time in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, 79, former national secretary of the ANC, was released from prison on 
Nov. 5, 1987, after serving 23 years of a life sentence on charges of plotting 
with Nelson Mandela to topple the minority white government. 
</P>
<P>
He had been under 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. house arrest in his Port Elizabeth home and 
had been banned from speaking with the press.

SIKH SEPARATISTS KILL 19 STUDENTS AT INDIA COLLEGE

Armed Sikh separatists stormed one of the country's most prestigious 
engineering colleges before dawn Friday, killing 19 students asleep in a 
dormitory, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The militants, armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, entered Thapar Engineering 
College and knocked on the door of the dormitory, said a police spokesman. When 
one of the students opened the door, the gunmen opened fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremists fighting for an 
independent homeland in Punjab, a rich farming state on the northern border 
with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people died instantly and three died later of their injuries. Five 
other students remained hospitalized, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were from colleges in neighboring states who had come to attend the 
school's annual youth festival, said the police spokesman, who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at 2:30 a.m., hours before Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
arrived in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, for a brief visit. Gandhi made no 
public statement on attack. 
</P>
<P>
Patiala, in southern Punjab, is about 45 miles southwest of Chandigarh. 
</P>
<P>
The Thapar College, one of the best known institutions in northern India, has 
about 1,500 students. About 200 others had come for the youth festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year in their bid to 
carve out a separate homeland they want to call Khalistan, or "Land of the 
Pure." 
</P>
<P>
The radicals allege Sikhs are socially and culturally discriminated against by 
the Hindu majority and the Hindu-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
Sikhs make up 2% of India's 880 million people but are a slight majority in 
Punjab. Hindus comprise 82% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
In Fazibad in northeastern India, police arrested 1,000 Muslim protesters who 
tried to march to nearby Ayodhya, where celebrating Hindus laid the foundation 
stone of a new temple at a site claimed by both religions. 
</P>
<P>
Babri Masjid, the Mosque of Babar, was built in the 17th Century on the spot in 
Ayodhya where Hindu fundamentalists claim one of their most popular gods, Lord 
Ram, was born. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 minutes after the arrests in Faizabad, Hindus celebrated the laying of 
the foundation stone of a new Ram temple 130 feet from the Babar Mosque.

The villagers had no electricity. They still made furrows in the fields with 
their bare feet, and their idea of irrigation was praying to the Hindu rain 
god. Many had never even heard of television, and, certainly, none knew a TV 
screen could be the size of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Yet suddenly, right in the heart of their own village of dust and straw, there 
was Dr. Jain's sleek, Japanese-built van, opening up to reveal an 
eight-foot-square screen, back-lit by a high-powered 600-lumen projector, 
attached to a state-of-the-art videocassette player and powered by its own 
portable generator. 
</P>
<P>
The program for the night: politics -- specifically, an entertaining campaign 
video in their own local dialect that is part of a high-tech, electoral 
revolution taking place in the largest democracy on earth. 
</P>
<P>
It is the latest wrinkle that reflects Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's 
five-year effort to transform ancient and moribund India into a modern state -- 
"to fuse," as Gandhi pledged when he took power five years ago, "the wisdom of 
our seers with the insights and artifacts of science and technology. To build 
an India of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
But, with a passionate personal dislike for the prime minister and more than 30 
video chariots to carry his message home, Jain is using his ultra-modern 
recording studio in New Delhi and his mobile image machines in ways that may 
not be exactly what Gandhi had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
As campaigning began nationwide this week for the most hotly contested and 
unpredictable general elections in Indian history, Jain has launched his own 
campaign to turn Gandhi's high-tech revolution against him. 
</P>
<P>
Using a computerized collage of what he calls "electronic posters," 
"psychedelic symbolism" and "a cheerful revolution of high technology," Jain, a 
surgeon turned image-maker, is providing India's now largely unified political 
opposition with an alternative to Gandhi's own video campaign on the powerful, 
state-run national television network and taking that message to rich rural 
vote banks where not even government television can reach. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has a monopoly on television in this country," Jain said. "But 
technology is nobody's monopoly. And what we are offering, no television 
network in the world can: portable theaters that can target captive markets 
right in their own back yards." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Jain's video campaign -- and indeed, Gandhi's own slick, video 
assault -- appear to be something of a mutation from the progressive prime 
minister's original high-tech vision. 
</P>
<P>
When the then-largely apolitical Gandhi was swept to power on a sympathy wave 
after his mother's assassination in 1984, he pledged to use high-tech as a tool 
of development, not politics; to harness satellites and computers for locating 
underground drinking water, not for identifying hidden vote banks; for 
immunizing millions of children, not politicizing millions of voters. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gandhi's Administration has used advanced technology successfully to 
help rural India. His high-tech initiatives have doubled the success rate for 
finding and digging drinking wells. They have helped to cushion the country's 
830 million people against a devastating drought two years ago. They have 
brought life-saving vaccines to millions in remote regions. And they have 
vastly improved India's telecommunications system, once among the world's 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
But such advances have not made much of an impression on a campaign full of 
such sexy political issues as corruption, religious communalism and rising 
prices, and the technology through which they were achieved is still at several 
removes from the Indian masses. 
</P>
<P>
To Sam Pitroda, Gandhi's American-trained high-technology guru, the failure has 
not been in the government's use of technology, but in the presentation of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have mismanaged the concept of high-tech," said Pitroda, who gave up his 
U.S. citizenship to join Gandhi as his personal adviser on technology five 
years ago. "Whenever we talk of high technology, we assume it is urban, elite, 
foreign, exotic, fancy and sexy. We don't project the image that technology is 
just for problem-solving. And, really, that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Indian public has equated Gandhi's high-tech boom with 
computer toys, electronic gadgetry and video-cassette recorders, all of which 
have taken the Indian middle class by storm but remain far out of the reach of 
rural villages, where as many as 80% of all Indians live. 
</P>
<P>
Referring specifically to Jain and his video-on-wheels enterprise, Pitroda 
smiled and said, "That's only petty, little stuff. High-tech isn't just TV. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is the price you pay in a democracy. With a lot of good, some misuses 
are bound to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, that is not the way Jain sees his multimillion-dollar enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, Jain Studios also entered the world of high technology 
initially to help open the doors of development to his backward nation. But, in 
the overly politicized and polarized context of today's India, not even 
technology has been spared. Jain insisted that he was locked out of access to 
the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
"I first got involved in all of this because I wanted to go into medical 
television," he said. "I produced videos aimed at the illiterate villagers on 
family planning, sanitation, primary health care and similar subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped to sell these videos to Doordarshan (India's state-run television 
network). But they sort of black-listed me." 
</P>
<P>
Jain is a long-standing, ranking member of the opposition Bharatiya Janata 
Party (Indian People's Party), and he claims his videos were blocked simply 
because of his strong and outspoken political affiliation. So he charted a 
course of high-tech revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I said we should make better videos and even better programming than 
Doordarshan and target them to specific districts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jain and his wife went on intensive buying trips to Japan and America, and, 
under Gandhi's liberalized import policy for technology, Jain built his 
state-of-the-art studio here, complete with 3-D computer graphics machines, 
dozens of editing and display consoles and a staff of 400 engineers, among them 
a core group of young, American-trained computer hackers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jain is the first to concede that his video chariots will have little 
nationwide impact on the upcoming elections. In a sprawling nation of more than 
100 dialects and 400 million voters that more resembles a continent than a 
country, the image doctor hopes only to sway key, critical races where the 
opposition has hired his services. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only made an idea become a reality," he said. "And regardless of the 
outcome of the election, win or lose, I really hope only that this experiment 
will lead to a more productive use of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
"I have, for example, about 20 family planning videos that have never been 
shown. They're based on folklore and traditional music, combined with 
state-of-the-art computer graphics. I know they will work. And, well, maybe if 
the opposition comes to power, perhaps I can even get them on the air someday."

PLO SEEKS CLARIFICATION OF BAKER'S PEACE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: BLUEPRINT FOR TALKS WITH ISRAELIS IS NEITHER ACCEPTED NOR REJECTED.

The Palestine Liberation Organization, struggling to maintain its role in 
negotiating the future of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, 
declined on Friday to accept or reject a U.S. peace plan and instead submitted 
a request for clarification of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the PLO leadership late Thursday in Tunis, a PLO envoy 
arrived here Friday with a list of questions about a plan drawn up by Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The questions, sources said, reflect the same demands the PLO leadership 
expressed last month in Baghdad, Iraq, when the leaders insisted that it be 
left to the PLO to appoint any Palestinian delegation. The PLO also insisted on 
an open agenda for the talks, an agenda not limited to the question of 
elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The clarification request signaled the PLO's continuing differences over the 
framework for the talks with Israel, which endorsed the Baker plan last week 
based on "assumptions" that no representative of the PLO would take part in the 
talks and that they would be limited to details of elections in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has said he does not intend to modify his five-point plan to accommodate 
the Israeli assumptions or provide secret guarantees to either party. But U.S. 
officials have not said how they will resolve the fundamental differences that 
remain over the scope of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is scheduled to meet with President Bush 
on Wednesday in Washington, and their discussion is expected to include the 
proposed talks. A PLO envoy arrived Friday morning with a copy of the 
clarification request. Egypt, which is serving as intermediary in the dialogue, 
was to transmit the request to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled Hassan, a senior political adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and a 
leader of his moderate Fatah wing, refused in an interview Friday to enumerate 
the PLO's concerns about the Baker plan. He said the PLO leadership is "seeking 
additional clarification" based on points raised by the PLO's Central Council 
in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-member council, which acts as a link between the Palestinians' 
parliament-in-exile and the ruling executive committee, was critical of the 
Baker plan and emphasized that in any peace talks the PLO must choose the 
Palestinian delegation and that the agenda must be open to all topics. Thursday 
night's meeting in Tunis included a broad spectrum of the PLO leadership, 
including the executive committee, the leaders of guerrilla groups and 
officials of the parliament-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan did not say that the PLO, with its new questions, was closing the door 
to further discussion of the Baker plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not making propaganda," he said. "We are sincere in trying to make 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with reporters in Tunis, PLO spokesman Bassam abu Sharif said that 
the organization had adopted "a positive position; it means discussions will 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
Although PLO officials refused to publicly discuss details of the questions 
they raised in their latest communique, the Egyptian-owned Middle East News 
Agency, quoting Palestinian sources in Cairo, said they also included questions 
about whether the dialogue would lead to the convening of an international 
peace conference and whether the United States would guarantee that Israel 
would endorse the concept of trading land for peace.

Surprising numbers that turned up during verification of the vote count in the 
Yonkers, N.Y., mayoral race cast doubt on the results of the bitter election, 
apparently won by an opponent of court-ordered housing desegregation. With five 
of the city's 12 wards recounted, officials said Democratic incumbent Nicholas 
Wasicsko had picked up 1,663 votes, cutting by more than a third the margin by 
which he trailed Republican Henry Spallone. The election was basically a 
referendum on the housing-desegregation issue, with Spallone urging continued 
defiance of the court-ordered plan and Wasicsko calling for compliance. The 
canvass of votes was suspended Friday for Veterans Day and was to resume 
Monday.

A General Motors Corp. executive and his wife were found shot to death, their 
bodies dumped in a park, after their home was ransacked and looted Friday, 
police and FBI agents said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn E. and Wanda Tarr's neighbors reported a possible break-in about 5:30 
a.m. Friday. The couple were not there, and police said it appeared they had 
been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
Their bodies were discovered by a woman walking her dog in a park in nearby 
Pontiac later Friday. Each had been shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe they were shot at the home," said Hal Helterhoff, who heads 
FBI operations in Michigan. Helterhoff said money was taken from the couple's 
account at a 24-hour bank machine at 9:06 p.m. Thursday, but that two other 
attempts to get cash shortly afterward failed. The FBI believes Mrs. Tarr was 
forced back to her home, which was then robbed and ransacked. The couple later 
were shot. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's two cars, a 1989 Geo Prizm and a 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier, were 
missing. Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection were believed 
taken from the home, Helterhoff added.

Glenn Tarr is assistant manager of marketing information and research for GM's

President Bush signed legislation that will require all states to use 
competitive bidding to buy food and formula for poor women, children and 
infants. Bush said the 28 states that already use competitive bidding in the 
Women's, Infants' and Children's program have saved $300 million this year and 
have been able to serve 500,000 more people. Bush signed the Child Nutrition 
and WIC Reauthorization Act on Air Force One while flying to Dallas for a 
speech. The measure "will save an additional $40 million and allow 68,000 more 
needy pregnant women, infants and children to participate in WIC," Bush said in 
a statement. Bush said he is "firmly committed to helping nutritionally 
deficient children obtain improved nourishment that will give them a better 
start in life."

Baltimore officials have agreed to take back a trainload of sewage sludge after 
authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi refused to let a disposal company 
unload the waste in their states. The first of 63 carloads of the nonhazardous 
waste will begin arriving in about nine days at the Back River waste treatment 
plant that produced the sludge, city officials said. The 5,000 tons of sludge 
will be treated with lime and then transferred to a facility that will mix the 
waste with leaves and sell it as compost, George Balog, the city's public works 
director said.

Searchers found a body Friday in the rubble of a suburban apartment complex 
where a fighter jet crashed in a fireball. 
</P>
<P>
The young man's body was found in the apartment that absorbed the heaviest 
damage from the crash, Cobb County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, who ejected just before the jet crashed Thursday night, remained in 
critical condition, as did a pregnant woman and her 5-year-old child, who were 
burned on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part was just the sounds -- that little girl screaming," said 
resident Tamara Owens. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Bill Barcus, who still had a reddened face and a singed arm Friday 
from facing the intense heat in an attempt to reach the woman, said: "I got to 
within 10 feet of the woman but it was too hot and I didn't have any shoes on. 
All I could hear were her screams, but I had to back off. I went back to get my 
shoes, but by then somebody had gotten her." 
</P>
<P>
The man whose body was found about 3 p.m. Friday was identified only as white 
and in his 20s. Burton said there was no indication that anyone else was in the 
apartment, where he said a man had lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not immediately identify the resident or the body. Only one 
person was known to be missing before discovery of the body, but the search 
continued. Four missing people were located earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people were left homeless by the fire, and about 50 others who lived 
in undamaged portions of the Pine Lake Village Apartment complex had not been 
allowed to return to their homes Friday afternoon. Most spent Thursday night at 
a nearby motel, which offered free lodging. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr. of Marietta, Ga., the only person aboard 
the unarmed A-7E Corsair II attack plane, was reported doing better Friday, but 
remained unconscious after brain surgery, said Kennestone Hospital spokeswoman 
Laurel Fredlake. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Padovani, 28, and her daughter, Jacquelyn, suffered burns over about 
half their bodies, said Grady Memorial Hospital spokesman Jim Driscoll. He said 
the mother also had a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Kraemer, who said he was Padovani's fiance, said she was pregnant. He said 
doctors told him the unborn child might not survive. 
</P>
<P>
A woman hurt while fleeing her apartment was treated for cracked ribs, and a 
military rescue worker broke an ankle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished the blaze about two hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Larry Williams said the search of the apartment of the man believed 
missing was "a military type operation." Civilian searchers were kept away 
through much of the day while Navy investigators looked for clues, and Marine 
Reserve guards helped seal off the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Police officer Frank Durrance said the Navy jet struck the edge of a building 
before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about 30 
yards away. "You could tell it was a car, but you can't tell that it was a 
plane," Durrance said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathie Barton, Smyrna's director of community relations, said 12 apartments 
were destroyed and 20 damaged in two buildings. Three of the 32 units in those 
buildings were vacant, said Jim Humphrey, maintenance supervisor for the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The jet crashed 2.5 miles short of the runway at Naval Air Station Atlanta, 
located at Dobbins Air Force Base, 15 miles northwest of Atlanta. The pilot was 
to land there while on a navigational training mission, the Navy said.

A pregnant mother died Friday of burns inflicted when a fighter jet crashed 
into a suburban apartment complex. Earlier in the day, searchers found a man's 
body in the wreckage of his incinerated apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Navy investigators, meanwhile, continued hunting through the debris for clues 
to Thursday evening's crash, but said they did not know what caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Padovani, 28, died of her injuries Friday night, said John Hester, night 
administrator at Grady Memorial Hospital, where Padovani had been transferred 
with burns over half of her body. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's 5-year-old daughter remained in critical but stable condition at 
the hospital, Hester said. The pilot, who ejected just before the jet crashed 
in a fireball, also remained in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part was just the sounds -- that little girl screaming," said

"Obviously nobody (else) turned up missing, and that leads us to believe there 
is no one else in there," said Kathie Barton, Smyrna's director of community

</P>
<P>
The body was found in the kitchen of the last apartment in a building along the 
easternmost edge of the complex. Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon said he was told the 
apartment was incinerated by 4,000-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people were left homeless by the fire, and about 50 others who lived 
in undamaged portions of the Pine Lake Village Apartment complex had not been

</P>
<P>
Troy Kraemer, Padovani's fiance, said she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
A woman hurt while fleeing her apartment was treated for cracked ribs, and a 
military rescue worker broke an ankle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished the blaze about two hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Larry Williams said the search of the apartment of the man believed 
missing was "a military-type operation." Civilian searchers were kept away 
through much of the day while Navy investigators looked for clues, and Marine 
Reserve guards helped seal off the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Police officer Frank Durrance said the Navy jet struck the edge of a building 
before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about 30 
yards away. "You could tell it was a car, but you can't tell that it was a 
plane," Durrance said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said 12 apartments were destroyed and 20 damaged in two buildings. Three 
of the 32 units in those buildings were vacant, said Jim Humphrey, maintenance 
supervisor for the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The jet crashed 2 1/2 miles short of the runway at Naval Air Station Atlanta, 
located at Dobbins Air Force Base, 15 miles northwest of Atlanta. The pilot was 
to land there while on a navigational training mission, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
Conlyn, 37, has flown Navy aircraft for 15 years on active duty and in the 
Reserves. He joined Delta Air Lines in 1980 and is a co-pilot for the 
Atlanta-based carrier.

Rain and melting snow pushed rivers over their banks, sweeping away at least 
three homes, collapsing part of a bridge and forcing as many as 80 people to 
evacuate, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings remained in effect Friday along the Nooksack and three other 
rivers in northwestern Washington, with the National Weather Service predicting 
warm weather and occasionally heavy rain in the Cascade Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of a bridge over the 
Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000 people, although some could 
be reached overland through Canada, said Gary Myers of the county's Department 
of Emergency Services. Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mt. 
Baker, filling the river's three forks. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said three houses and several mobile homes had been swept away near 
Glacier, 90 miles north of Seattle. No one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings also were posted along the Skagit, Snoqualmie and Snohomish 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 9 and 544 were closed at Everson, where most of the evacuations 
occurred.

Dozens of thick steel bolts that connect the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge 
to its concrete towers were stretched and sheared during the Oct. 17 
earthquake, a failure more mysterious to engineers than the collapse of a 
section of the upper deck. The California Department of Transportation said the 
affected sections would be strengthened and stronger bolts added prior to the 
scheduled reopening of the span to thousands of commuters as early as Friday. 
Engineers said recent inspections discovered the bolts that were ripped from 
the foundation footings along the first one-third mile of the bridge. The 
damage, engineers said, apparently occurred because of a strong up-and-down 
movement not expected during an earthquake.

Hall. The run-down dormitory that became a Berkeley legend will be closed Dec. 
20. Residents will be given rooms elsewhere in the co-op system. The building 
may be sold, converted to an apartment complex or reopened as housing for

Timber industry spokesmen asked the U.S. Forest Service on Friday to speed up 
logging of trees killed by the 3-year-old drought in California's mountain 
forests. "We think there are about 6 billion board feet of dead trees between 
Lassen County and the Mexican border, and they ought to be removed because they 
will be a fire hazard next summer," said Kevin Ekery, spokesman for the lumber 
industry's Alliance for Environment and Resources. Both the Forest Service and 
the California Department of Forestry agree that as much as 20% of the timber 
in the central Sierra may be dead as the result of the drought.

A bodybuilder suspected of being a major supplier of steroids in the Sacramento 
region was arrested Friday and charged with illegally selling the drug, police 
said. David Christopher Johnson, 22, was taken into custody without incident on 
his way to work at the Body Emporium and was booked into city jail, authorities 
said. Undercover agents twice bought the drug from him -- once at his work -- 
and a search warrant was obtained for his apartment, police said. After the 
arrest, authorities searching his residence said they found dozens of boxes of 
steroids, a large amount of cash and equipment for injecting the drug.

J. HUGHES; ACTOR ON TV, STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson Hughes, whose one-man show "Our Man in Nirvana" just last month 
completed a six-month run at Hollywood's Theatre Theater, died Monday in Los 
Angeles of the complications of AIDS. He was 30. 
</P>
<P>
In the stage show, the sometime TV actor portrayed a wildly outrageous German 
microbiologist who trance-channels a fashion designer, Polish-Jewish ballerina 
and other characters which he invented. 
</P>
<P>
It featured wild monologues spoken by the salty personas he devised for himself 
and was widely praised when it opened last April. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes studied drama with Stella Adler in New York before moving to Los 
Angeles, where he continued his studies with Kim Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
He was seen in "Capitol" and other TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his mother, Evelyn H. Nehl, his father, C. B. Hughes, a 
sister and brother who ask contributions in his name to the AIDS Research 
Center at UCLA.

The Dorsey High Dons sat in the campus weight room Friday, eyes trained on a 
television set that played a videotape of their football game against rival 
Crenshaw High the night before. 
</P>
<P>
As the tape ran into the fourth quarter, with Dorsey leading 28 to 6, the 
images abruptly changed. There was the recorded sound of a single pop, and 
people fell to the grass. On the flickering tape, fans stampeded onto the 
field, coaches assembled squad members at the 50-yard-line. This was no longer 
a game film; it was more like evidence. 
</P>
<P>
That popping sound Thursday night was gunfire. Though the severals shots heard 
apparently came from outside Jackie Robinson Stadium, the 800 people at the 
game feared that a sniper was on the loose or a gang war had broken out. In 
terror, they hit the ground or bolted for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God, people started hopping over the fence, they were tearing their 
clothes, they were screaming, pushing and shoving," said Shauntel Wilcox, a 
16-year-old cheerleader. "I was so scared. I was terrified. I was scared for my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Friday they were not sure who was responsible for the gunfire, 
which they said consisted of at least 20 rounds fired from two different 
locations. While no one was reported hit by gunfire, the terror for the fans 
and players took its own toll. 
</P>
<P>
Several spectators, players and coaches at the traditional match-up between 
Southwest Los Angeles schools Crenshaw and Dorsey said that the gunfire was the 
result of the deadly rivalry between the Crips and the Bloods. They said the 
Crips consider Crenshaw High their territory, while the Bloods claim the 
neighborhood surrounding Dorsey High. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the gunfire appeared to be to ignite panic at the stadium, 
spectators and others said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care who they may hurt, they just want to destroy," one witness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials could not confirm that gang members were involved and did not 
assign a motive. No arrests had been made by late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the times in Los Angeles that Paul Knox, Dorsey's offensive coach, 
said he had prepared his team not only for opponents' blitz, but also for the 
possibility that there might be gang violence at a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about what to do in case of gunfire," he said. "I told my 
players in case of an emergency get in the middle of the field and get down. We 
have never had to deal with gunfire, but we have developed contingency plans, 
just like in an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Those plans fell apart Thursday night as fans began spilling onto the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard this boom sound, the gunshots, and immediately I went down," said 
Demetrick Watts, 17-year-old defensive end. "Then people from the stands began 
stepping over me and I was scared I was going to get trampled." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Wray, 18, was on the sidelines frantically trying to find his mother in 
the crowd. "She was supposed to be at the game, but I couldn't find her," he 
said. "Then I ran into someone who told me she wasn't able to get to the game. 
That was the first game that I was at that I was happy my mom didn't come to 
see me play." 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the game was suspended, and the players from both teams 
were taken to their locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are all friends," Knox said. "Sure there is an intense rivalry 
between them, a fierce rivalry, but they are friends, some are members of the 
same families. They went to junior high school together and they party 
together. Those people who were out there shooting have no regard for 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Terrel Ray, one of Crenshaw's football coaches, said the escalation of gang 
violence harms the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that things like this wouldn't happen," he said. "I wish these kids, 
these gang members, would realize that they are making things bad for the rest 
of us. People point the finger at the school when things like this happen, but 
it is not the schools. These are not bad schools, these are bad individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The anger at the shooting incident was also expressed by Lamont Waren, 
16-year-old running back at Dorsey. "All I want to do is play football. This is 
crazy, we shouldn't have to worry about being shot," he said. "This has been a 
very difficult season for us, all we want to do is play football." 
</P>
<P>
Waren and other players observed that this year the Dorsey football squad seems 
to have suffered more than its share. Beyond the standard football injuries and 
heartbreak defeats, the team suffered a tragedy last month when star receiver 
Kevin Copeland died of a heart attack after collapsing on the sidelines during 
a game against San Pedro.

DAUGHTER OF WOMAN IN ABORTION CASE TAKES A PRO-CHOICE STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The daughter of a plaintiff in a landmark abortion rights case said Friday she 
has decided to join the campaign for a woman's right to abortion, a stance 
opposite that of her biological mother, an outspoken abortion foe. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Able, 19, of Atlanta, said she will attend a massive pro-choice rally 
in Rancho Park on Sunday, her first foray into the loud and prolonged abortion 
rights fray. The rally is expected to be the second-largest in a series of 
nationwide pro-choice demonstrations on Sunday, the day after an anti-abortion 
march is to be held in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the choice should be left up to the woman whether or not they would 
like to go through with the pregnancy," Able said Friday in a news conference 
at attorney Gloria Allred's office. "I am speaking out because I don't want to 
see women's rights taken away." 
</P>
<P>
With those simple statements, Able, herself the mother of a toddler, entered 
the public arena. But perhaps few women's decision to take a stand on the issue 
is as tinged with irony as it is for Able. 
</P>
<P>
Her biological mother, Sandra Race Cano, was the "Mary Doe" of Doe vs. Bolton, 
the obscure companion case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court along with Roe 
vs. Wade and helped established a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Able is the product of Cano's fourth pregnancy, which was nearly aborted and 
was the subject of Doe vs. Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who also lives in Atlanta, gave her infant daughter up for adoption 
before the legal case was decided and now has become a fervent opponent of 
legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Cano and Able were reunited last year for the first time since Cano had given 
her up, and the two even lived together for a few months. But now, Able said, 
the two have not spoken for months, although she would not explain the reasons 
for the estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not discuss with her biological mother her decision to tell 
her story. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not going to be pleased, but I'm already getting ready for that," Able 
said in a deep Southern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
When Cano became pregnant with Able, she had already lost her other three 
children to foster care or adoption because she could not care for them. At the 
time of her fourth pregnancy in 1970, she was, according to her own accounts, 
emotionally and financially unstable, had been a mental patient and married to 
a man whom she called a child molester. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents and other published reports and interviews with 
those involved in her case, Cano applied for an abortion at a downtown Atlanta 
public hospital, but was rejected under Georgia's restrictive abortion law. 
With help from the Atlanta Legal Aid Society and a team of ACLU lawyers, Cano 
took a pseudonym and sued, while applying for an abortion at Georgia Baptist 
Hospital. She was approved there, but she left town rather than go through with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Cano now maintains that she was manipulated by her lawyers in the case and that 
she never wanted an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was plain old used," she told The Times in an interview earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Able, whose long blonde hair and bangs and a face devoid of makeup give her the 
appearance of someone younger than her 19 years, said the decision to speak out 
was not such a difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it should be illegal," she said of abortion. "You don't know 
what might happen to you. Who knows, someday I might need one." 
</P>
<P>
Able said she has never had an abortion. She said she married when she was 
pregnant with her infant daughter, but said she never considered getting an 
abortion at that time. 
</P>
<P>
She said she discussed her decision with her 24-year-old husband, who washes 
cars for a living, as well as with her adopted mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something between me and my husband," she said. "He agreed with me. 
There wasn't much to discuss." 
</P>
<P>
Her adopted mother, who has adopted other children, "said if I would like to do 
it (speak out), that I should. She believes in abortion too." 
</P>
<P>
Able said she was reunited with her birth mother when Cano's lawyer contacted 
the attorney who had handled the adoption, and that lawyer in turn called her 
adopted mother. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother left it up to me whether or not I wanted to meet her . . . so I 
called her," Able said. It was only then that her adopted mother told her about 
Sandra Cano and her role in the landmark abortion rights case. 
</P>
<P>
Able and her daughter lived with Cano on and off during a five-month period, 
but then had a falling-out that she will not discuss. 
</P>
<P>
When she decided she would speak out in favor of abortion rights, she said, she 
looked in the telephone book under "pro-choice," but found nothing. She then 
called several abortion clinics in Atlanta, and eventually was put in touch 
with Allred, a lawyer known for taking on feminist lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard on TV and the papers that there's a thing going on about one side 
making it illegal and also another side wanting it to be legal," she said. "I 
think it should stay legal." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she doesn't give much thought to how close she came to not being 
born, had her mother gone through with an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"She had her rights to her own feelings," she said. "If she'd had an abortion, 
she would have had her right."

1972 and then escaped from Alabama State Prison four years later. 
</P>
<P>
But an FBI computer in Washington remembered. And when Lawson, 41, was picked 
up by Los Angeles police four months ago for beating up his girlfriend, a 
routine check of his fingerprints caused the machine to dredge up a 13-year-old 
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said Lawson's fugitive warrant is one of the oldest they can 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
When the fingerprint match was established this week, Los Angeles police 
detectives returned to East 113th Street in Watts to rearrest Lawson, an 
unemployed painter. On Friday they were making plans to extradite him back to 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"He was surprised. He wasn't sure what he was being arrested for until we 
showed him the warrant," Detective Doug Lemelle said. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama prison authorities said they will take steps Monday to have Lawson 
returned. They said he was convicted in 1974 of assault with intent to kill a 
Birmingham police officer. He was serving a seven-year sentence at the 
minimum-security Red Eagle Work Farm near Montgomery when he slipped away on 
June 2, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Montgomery said Friday that they had long ago stopped looking 
for Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of him," said Montgomery Police Detective Don Letford, a 
10-year veteran of the force. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Patrolman Benny Allison Sr., the Birmingham officer that Lawson was 
convicted of shooting, was surprised to learn Friday that Lawson had been 
recaptured. That's because nobody remembered to notify Allison that Lawson had 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever called me to tell me. They should have notified me, but nobody 
told me," said Allison, now 63. 
</P>
<P>
Allison said he was shot in the lower stomach when he confronted Lawson and two 
other men breaking into a car in a parking structure outside a Birmingham bank. 
Lawson pulled Allison's service revolver from its holster while the officer 
wrestled with one of the other suspects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The wound left Allison partially paralyzed and forced his retirement after 22 
years with the Birmingham department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Hale, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections in Montgomery, 
said Alabama law requires that his agency attempt to extradite Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
"He still owes the state time," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, Lawson's girlfriend said she hopes that Alabama has a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried all night," said Diana Washington, 39. "He's a good man. He'd tried to 
put his troubles behind him."

OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE TO REMOVE LARGE CROSSES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE FORMER PRESBYTERIAN SCHOOL WILL REPLACE TWO EXTERIOR CHAPEL 
CROSSES WITH A SCULPTURE IN HOPES OF ATTRACTING A MORE DIVERSE STUDENT BODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Occidental College, which used to be a Presbyterian school, has decided to 
remove the two large crosses from the campus chapel's exterior and replace them 
with a sculpture aimed at welcoming students of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
The much-debated change reflects efforts to attract a more diverse student body 
to the liberal arts college in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles. 
Occidental was founded by Presbyterians in 1887 but ended that formal religious 
affiliation in 1912, although the school has kept some informal ties with the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no desire to reject the values and the traditions that undergird 
religious faith, but we simply don't want to be a college that is seen as 
restrictive in terms of its students," Occidental President John B. Slaughter 
said. His hiring last year as the school's first black president was also seen 
as a move for diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1964, the modernistic Herrick Memorial Chapel and its 35-foot-high 
metal crosses are prominently located near the main entrance to the campus. As 
a result, some teachers and faculty complained, visitors may get the impression 
that Occidental is a Christian school. Two years ago, the faculty called for 
the crosses to come down quickly. 
</P>
<P>
However, the idea of removing the crosses offended some trustees and alumni. 
Officials say it took many delicate discussions to reach a compromise: an 
ecumenical artwork will replace the crosses and a plaque explaining 
Occidental's Presbyterian heritage will be placed near the building. 
</P>
<P>
Christian symbolism inside the chapel, including the cross on its stained glass 
windows, will remain. And the change will not affect the structure of the 
building itself, which, like many churches, is in the shape of a cross. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena architect John Andre Gougeon, who has done many church designs, said 
his assignment to produce Occidental's interfaith sculpture was one of the most 
difficult and emotional in his 27-year career. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he attempted to present symbols of different religions, such as a 
Christian cross, a Jewish menorah, an Islamic crescent, a Buddhist wheel, along 
with a dove of peace, all within one circle. But a committee of Occidental 
students, teachers, alumni and trustees feared some religion would be left out 
or insulted by relative prominence of one icon over another. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year and 10 designs later, Gougeon and the panel came up with the 
idea of the sculpture now being called "Seeking Together." To be cast in 
aluminum, it will depict the outlines of 29 young men and women seeming to 
march in a V-shaped line. Some of the figures have their arms upraised joyfully 
and others are holding hands with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents students from all over the world coming together to seek 
knowledge and spiritual growth on this campus," Gougeon said while showing a 
visitor the final drawings tacked up on his office studio walls. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-foot-wide, 20-foot-high artwork, the cost of which is still 
undetermined, is expected to be ready by spring or summer. The crosses will 
remain until then and the college hopes to give them to a church or another 
school, said Occidental chaplain Douglas Gregg, a Presbyterian minister. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said it will be painful for some to see the change. But "it's a good and 
right thing to do. It's a Christian thing to do," he stressed, because 
Christianity is not seeking exclusive claim to all students' spiritual lives. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of Occidental's 1,600 students described themselves as Protestants in 
recent surveys, 15% as Catholics, 8% Jewish, smaller amounts as Muslims or 
Buddhists and the rest list no religion, Gregg said. Among Protestants, 
Presbyterians are still the largest group on campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the sculpture is installed, Occidental expects to hold a rededication 
ceremony for the chapel, whose name has been expanded to the Herrick Memorial 
Chapel and Interfaith Center.

HAMMER GETS A PACEMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Industrialist Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum, was 
hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center on Friday and underwent surgery for 
insertion of a cardiac pacemaker, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is alert and talking, and his cardiologist, Dr. Jan Tillisch, expects him 
to be released from the hospital in a few days and to return to normal 
activities," Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the elective operation, the feisty Hammer granted a telephone 
interview from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got out of the operating room (and) had dinner," said Hammer in a low, 
scratchy voice. "There is no question that it was not a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer explained: "Recently, I had fallen and had some rib trouble. . . . The 
doctor recommended I have a pacemaker put in. He said I would function better 
and that the pacemaker would protect me from future problems. 
</P>
<P>
"During the trouble with Watergate, people told me I was faking with my heart," 
Hammer said. But nearly 20 years later, Hammer said there is finally some 
public evidence that "I have had problems with my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer had pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions to President 
Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign, and after a decade-long quest, he was 
pardoned earlier this year by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Richard Elbaum said the procedure that Hammer underwent was 
elective. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not come in under an emergency situation," Elbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
A pacemaker regulates electrical activity in the heart so that it beats 
normally in a person who suffers abnormal heart rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
According to a hospital source, Hammer had been in Hawaii where he had been 
involved in a marathon negotiation and had become exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in Occidental stock was suspended Friday on the New York Stock Exchange 
with news of Hammer's hospitalization. When he has been ill in the past, the 
price of the firm's stock has surged, because the firm is considered a likely 
takeover target without Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
The 91-year-old philanthropist is known worldwide for his collection of art, 
endowment of museums and tens of millions of dollars in contributions to 
charities and medical research. 
</P>
<P>
In his long business career, spanning seven decades, he developed a remarkable 
relationship with the Soviet Union. Going to Russia at age 23, he made a deal 
with Lenin to supply surplus U.S. wheat. He has met every Soviet leader since. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, who was born in the Bronx, N.Y., and educated as a medical doctor, 
never entered practice. Instead, he took over his father's faltering 
pharmaceutical business and made it a success. 
</P>
<P>
He acquired Occidental Petroleum in 1956 and turned it into a conglomerate of 
fuel, chemicals and food with $20 billion a year in sales.

VETERANS: A REPLICA OF THE VIETNAM MEMORIAL IN WASHINGTON COMES TO LOS ANGELES 
FOR VETERANS DAY. 
</P>

<P>
Carla Bendele was raised in the shadow of tanks at the Army's armor training 
center at Ft. Hood, Tex. The daughter of a career officer, she knew the rigors 
and dangers of military life. 
</P>
<P>
One college sweetheart and her first husband were killed during the height of 
the war in Vietnam, and a second husband committed suicide after coming home 
from the war. 
</P>
<P>
She signed up for duty in Vietnam in 1966, experiencing both the conflict's 
cruelty and its lighter moments firsthand as a civilian nurse attached to Army 
units based near Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that prepared her for Friday, when she looked at the Moving Wall, 
the traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. The 
portable monument was set up for this weekend's observance of Veterans Day at 
Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"If people didn't come up to talk to me, I think I'd be crying all day long," 
said Bendele, 48, a nursing student at San Bernardino Valley College who tried 
to control her quivering voice. "It's still very, very painful for me." 
</P>
<P>
There were other scenes at the wall as Forest Lawn officials prepared a 
round-the-clock vigil this weekend in honor of Veterans Day. The father of Army 
Sgt. James Michael Ray, declared missing in action March 18, 1968, placed a 
note on the wall next to his son's name. 
</P>
<P>
The note simply said, "Happy Birthday. We miss you." 
</P>
<P>
Two buddies who served in Vietnam as members of the Army's 1st Infantry 
Division sat quietly, reaching out to touch the name of a friend on the wall. 
It is one of 58,156 listed on the wall -- a 252-foot replica that is half the 
size of the Washington wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Jimmy," said Sal Flores, 41, of Sun Valley, "if you gotta be one. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Be a Big Red One," chimed in companion Armando Lopez of Arleta, referring to 
the bright red patch that division members wear on their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
The Moving Wall exhibit is being sponsored by Forest Lawn with the cooperation 
of two local chapters of Vietnam Veterans of America. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Lawn spokesman Dick Fisher said various veterans organizations will have 
people on duty around the clock throughout the weekend to help visitors locate 
the names of loved ones on the wall. The exhibit can also be viewed from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit closes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several representatives of veterans groups spoke to a crowd of about 100 during 
an informal ceremony marking the exhibit's opening Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
K.R. Zack Earp, chairman of California's council of Vietnam Veterans of 
America, fought back tears in beseeching those in attendance: 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a Vietnam veteran, reach out your hand and say, 'Thank you . . . 
and welcome home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Several hours earlier, a more formal Veterans Day ceremony -- bursting with 
pomp and pageantry -- drew about 300 to Forest Lawn's Court of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the 30th annual West Coast Sacred Torch Ceremony, featuring the 
presentation of torches lit in seven foreign countries, heard Army Maj. Gen. 
Robert C. Thrasher, the adjutant general of California's National Guard, remind 
them of the sacrifices made by this nation's war dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace itself demands continual sacrifice," the two-star general said. "Their 
lives will never be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
But there was little of the intense emotion on display that was clearly evident 
during the smaller Vietnam ceremony. Standing near the wall, men in faded green 
fatigues routinely broke into tears. They occasionally embraced strangers, who 
offered comfort. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Bendele sat on a curb for a time and just stared at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as bitter as I once was," she said softly, recalling the deaths of 
loved ones. "Now, everyone on that wall is my personal friend."

CONTROVERSY OVER LAND FOR PALESTINIANS BECOMES RELIGION ISSUE; 
</P>

ISRAEL: RABBIS ENTER THE FRAY, SOMETIMES USING THE SAME BIBLICAL PASSAGE TO 
SUPPORT OPPOSING VIEWS.

Behold, the Lord your God has set the land before you: Go up and possess it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deuteronomy 1:21 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis are speaking out more and more on the vexing issue of whether Israel can 
and should give up land that is in dispute with Palestinians, and the rabbis 
engaged in the debate offer studious assurances that God backs their views. 
</P>
<P>
It is a discussion in which Talmudic scholars from ages past are recruited as 
allies by all sides. Biblical passages are cited as supporting evidence; 
sometimes opposing arguments are backed by the same passages. No matter. The 
discussion has shaken up established views of Israeli politics and set Israelis 
to pondering unresolved issues of the nature of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Jewish tradition, God gave the land -- most often now defined as the 
territory that makes up modern Israel proper as well as the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip -- to the Jewish people. The focus of the current argument lies in 
whether the value of conserving human life supersedes the value of keeping all 
the land. In the name of peace, can a biblical inheritance be deferred to some 
distant future when the Messiah comes and settles all these earthly affairs? 
</P>
<P>
And what of the Arab inhabitants who live here? Are their vines and orchards, 
not to mention their mosques and churches, standing in the way of the 
fulfillment of God's will? 
</P>
<P>
The rabbinical thrust into the most sensitive issue facing Israeli society has 
brought out latent displeasure that holy men of any sort should be influencing 
affairs of state. 
</P>
<P>
"The implied presumption that rabbis -- or for that matter, priests, ayatollahs 
and other clerics believed to represent divine authority -- should 'rule' on 
the crucial matters of state is known as theocracy," advised Yirmayahu Yovel, a 
philosophy professor at Hebrew University. "Theocracy opposes not only the idea 
of the modern liberal state in general but specifically the idea on which 
Israel as the modern Jewish state was built." 
</P>
<P>
The independent newspaper Maariv, bemoaning the involvement of the rabbis in 
political life, stated flatly: "The rulings on Jewish law, made by doves or 
hawks, should not determine Israel's political direction." 
</P>
<P>
Critics notwithstanding, Israel is a country where religion and politics are 
closely entwined. Caucuses of black-clad bearded Hasidic politicians are common 
fare in Israel's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Religious parties representing various shades of Jewish Orthodoxy hold the 
balance of power between the two main secular blocs, the Likud and Labor 
parties, in the nation's Parliament. Likud, the party of Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir, favors keeping all the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied 
militarily for 22 years. Labor, the junior partner in the fragile ruling 
coalition, appears willing to give some of the land in return for peace with 
the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Any shift by major religious leaders could have important political 
implications. If either of the two main parties splits from the government and 
tries to form a new ruling alliance, religious parties will hold the key. If 
new elections take place, religious parties will surely have a role in 
subsequent coalition-building. 
</P>
<P>
Labor politicians have already been canvassing religious groups to see if they 
could build a working parliamentary coalition. For Labor, with its secular 
traditions, that in itself is a small revolution. 
</P>
<P>
It had been commonly assumed that religious parties lean toward keeping the 
occupied lands at all costs. Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza often raise the 
banner of religious determinism to justify their campaigns to settle the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
But that assumption was upset by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of 
Shas, a party representing Orthodox Jews of North African and Near Eastern 
origin. Yosef is widely viewed as the country's most popular and charismatic 
rabbi; portraits of him wearing gold embroidered robes and dark glasses adorn 
not a few Sephardic homes. Shas holds six seats in the 120-member Israeli 
Parliament, more than any other religious party. 
</P>
<P>
Yosef told a conference on Jewish law in Jerusalem that saving lives supersedes 
the need to keep all the land, provided that generals and politicians agree 
that giving up the West Bank and Gaza is not a security threat to the nation as 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"If territories are handed over, (if) the danger of a war will recede and a 
chance of durable peace will arise, then it appears that by any reasoning it is 
permitted to hand over territory of the land of Israel for the sake of 
attaining this goal (of saving lives)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yosef said the Arab inhabitants should not be driven out both for religious and 
humanitarian reasons. On the one hand, the Muslims are not pagans because they 
worship one god. And even if they were "idol worshipers," they should not be 
driven away "out of a descent respect for the opinions of the nations." 
</P>
<P>
The comments created an uproar in part because of the unexpected nourishment 
they gave the hopes of Israeli doves. Yosef's constituency, Sephardic Jewry, 
has been widely viewed as expansionist, anti-Arab and supportive of Likud 
policies. Suddenly, the view was at least partially turned on its head. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Labor newspaper Davar called Yosef's lecture "the most significant 
event in Israeli politics in recent years. The tens of thousands who are 
influenced by (Yosef) could tip the scales between Likud and Labor." 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers noted an undercurrent in Yosef's words that struck at the 
urgings of muscular nationalism in Israel, a pillar of Likud's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Yosef comes from the world of the yeshiva that is not seduced by nationalism," 
remarked Rabbi David Hartman, head of the Shalom Hartman Institute for Judaic 
Studies. "They don't celebrate power. For them, nationalism and power are not 
the organizing principle of Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist rabbis did not accept Yosef's analysis lying down. They struck out 
with their own viewpoint, also firmly rooted in Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
State-appointed chief rabbis, one from the Sephardic community, the other from 
the Ashkenazi or European community, ruled that it is forbidden to give up the 
occupied land. It is a biblical duty to defend Jewish sovereignty; the danger 
to individuals cannot excuse giving it up. 
</P>
<P>
Argued Shlomo Goren, a former chief Ashkenazi rabbi, writing in support of the 
current chiefs' ruling: "There are no grounds for discussing the retention or 
return of parts of Israel in terms of the question of danger." 
</P>
<P>
Goren rejected the idea that the lands should be returned for ironclad peace 
treaties -- unless Israel were in danger of losing the territory through 
weakness in war. 
</P>
<P>
"If we find that from a purely military aspect we are not in a position to 
vanquish our enemies, then even a shaky peace treaty is preferable to a defeat 
on the battlefield," he wrote in the Jerusalem Post. 
</P>
<P>
While not directly calling for the expulsion of Arabs, Goren noted that because 
the largely Muslim population does not accept certain commandments laid down to 
the sons of Noah, they could not be given "lodging" in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Goren defined Israel's conflict with the Palestinians as an "obligatory war" 
that must be pursued with "the utmost devotion." 
</P>
<P>
While the battle among the rabbis raged in newspapers and religious journals, 
another stir arose over utopian proposals put forth by Menahem Froman, a rabbi 
from the small West Bank settlement of Tekoa. 
</P>
<P>
Froman's is the man-bites-dog story of the West Bank. A founder of the militant 
settler movement Gush Emunim, he devised a formula to share not only the 
disputed territories with Arabs but Israel proper. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, the land between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea would 
be ruled by two governments, one Israeli and one Palestinian. 
</P>
<P>
The Jews would owe allegiance to the Israeli authorities, the Arabs to the 
Palestinian. He calls his concept the foundation of a "humane state" in which 
all sides would maintain cultural and political identity with their own people. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to the widespread dismissal of his ideas as utopian, Froman shrugged: 
"This is the land of the prophets. It has always been the land of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Froman's ideas attracted little attention until he decided to meet with Faisal 
Husseini, a Palestinian activist linked with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I said was overly controversial," Froman recalled. "But people were 
bothered that I shook his hand." 
</P>
<P>
His neighbors in Tekoa, a hilltop community south of Bethlehem set among a ring 
of Arab villagers, are tolerant of the rabbi's views but less so of his meeting 
with Husseini. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a dreamer," said settler Murray Alon. "But he was meeting with the enemy, 
and that is hard to take." 
</P>
<P>
Froman's ideas stem from the notion that the state is not the sole, or even 
primary, force motivating contemporary Jewish history. He recalled that when 
his parents came to British-ruled Palestine, statehood was not their primary 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Zionism means to bring Jews home," Froman asserted. "The state is secondary. 
Or at least, a balance must be struck between the state and humankind." 
</P>
<P>
He reviles the image that many have of settlers as people who "wear religious 
clothes, a kippa (skullcap) and have murder in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest hope for peace is to spiritualize Israeli society," he concluded.

<P>
But does he not believe that possession of the land by Jews is a step toward 
divine redemption? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he responded, stroking his prophet-sized beard. "But there are many ways 
to possess. If it means coming in and throwing others out and creating horrible 
structures of control, what is good about that? If it is the beginning of a 
higher spiritual process, then it means something."

More than 3,000 bikers and motorcyclists will gather Sunday morning along the 
streets of Glendale near the Harley-Davidson shop at 3717 San Fernando Road for 
the 8 a.m. start of the sixth annual Love Ride. Last year, the event raised 
$360,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., Harley-Davidson's designated 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
The Love Ride originated with Oliver Shokouh, owner of Harley-Davidson of 
Glendale. The first few years, he and his employees organized the event in 
their spare time. With participants now numbering in the thousands, that's no 
longer possible. 
</P>
<P>
They come from as far away as New York City, at least in the case of Malcolm 
Forbes, this year's special guest. Forbes will jet in to ride with Willie G. 
Davidson, a Harley-Davidson vice president and grandson of the company's 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shokouh, among the Love Ride 6 riders will be music and 
entertainment personalities, including David Crosby, Jay Leno, Billy Idol, John 
James, Hoyt Axton, Peter Fonda, Eric Burdon, David Walsh, King on a Stick, John 
Schneider and comedian Rick Overton. Overton will be emcee of the program at 
Calamigos Ranch, destination of the 100-mile ride. 
</P>
<P>
The participant who raises the most pledge money for the Muscular Dystrophy 
Assn. will be awarded a $12,000 Harley Softail. The ride is open to anyone on 
any brand of motorcycle with an entry fee minimum of $35.

HOW CLOSE ARE RAMS TO GOOD?; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THEY WERE NEVER AS STRONG AS THE 5-0 RECORD OF THE EARLY SEASON. 
BUT THEY ARE NOT AS WEAK AS THE 0-4 TEAM SINCE. THERE IS STILL TIME TO CATCH 
THE 49ERS AND WIN THE NFC WEST CHAMPIONSHIP.

We could be 6-10 or 12-4, I really believe that, depending on how well we do 
and what happens injury-wise. That's pretty damn exciting, sitting with that 
kind of swing. -- John Robinson, Sept. 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
After nine games, four hair-raising plays have been the difference for the 
Rams, who could just as easily be 3-6 or 7-2, as 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, the Rams were never as good as advertised at 5-0 and aren't nearly as 
bad as they look now at 0-4 for their last four weeks. They are what their 
coach had predicted: A young, inconsistent, talented team with too many 
defensive soft spots to draw serious conclusions -- a team that keeps you 
running for the antacids. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, 5-4 wasn't so far-fetched, considering the Ram schedule through 
the middle -- Buffalo, New Orleans, Chicago, Minnesota. Yet the Rams, as in 
past seasons, remain the masters of heartstring plucking, first teasing their 
fans with a red-hot start, then crushing them with stunning losses to the Bills 
and the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
They've turned reality into a high-wire act. 
</P>
<P>
Still, five of the Rams' final seven games are quite winnable, and they get the 
Dallas Cowboys, the New York Jets and the New England Patriots in December. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just accept for a second that we make those plays in those two games," 
Robinson said Thursday, "we're 7-2, we're right there, you're saying this is a 
Super Bowl team and that the 49ers' game (Dec. 11) is going to be the one, and 
all those things. I'm not willing to accept the opposite, that we've all of a 
sudden lost it all." 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse, like 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
The four plays: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 24, Rams vs. Green Bay Packers at Anaheim Stadium. The Rams led, 
38-7, at halftime, but the Packers cut the lead to 38-31 and had a 
first-and-goal at the Ram one with 11:23 left when Brent Fullwood fumbled 
inches short of the end zone with what should have been the tying touchdown. 
The Rams hung on, 41-38. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oct. 1, Rams vs. San Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park. Fullback Tom 
Rathman of the 49ers, running out the clock on a presumed 12-10 win, fumbled at 
the Ram 19-yard line with 2:59 left. The Rams drove 72 yards and won the game 
on Mike Lansford's 26-yard field goal with two seconds left. Until then, 
Rathman hadn't fumbled this season and hasn't since. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oct. 16, Rams vs. Buffalo Bills at Rich Stadium. Quarterback Frank Reich 
hits Andre Reed on an eight-yard scoring pass with 16 seconds left to give the 
Bills a 23-20 victory. This came after the Rams had seemed to pull the game out 
on a 78-yard Jim Everett-to-Flipper Anderson touchdown pass with 1:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nov. 5, Rams vs. Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome. With the Rams leading, 
21-18, and 28 seconds remaining, Wade Wilson threw a Hail Mary pass of 43 yards 
to Hassan Jones, setting up the game-tying field goal with 12 seconds 
remaining. The Vikings won in overtime, 23-21. 
</P>
<P>
It comes down to this: If Rathman and Fullwood don't fumble, the Rams are 3-6 
today. Then again, if the Rams make one play on the Bills' final scoring drive, 
and somebody knocks down Wilson's desperation pass, they're 7-2, and all 
death-watch warnings are called off. 
</P>
<P>
"But since we didn't make those two plays, we're 5-4," cornerback LeRoy Irvin 
said. "I had a chance to make a play, to knock down the Hail Mary. I didn't 
knock it down. We played a good game that day, but we have to be able to make 
the play when we have to make it. That's the difference of winning and losing." 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong with the Rams? If they make two plays, apparently nothing. But 
since they didn't, everything. 
</P>
<P>
ANYONE SEEN A DEFENSE? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams gambled and lost by trying to tiptoe through the season with 
tissue-thin depth at inside linebacker. They couldn't even get through training 
camp. Because of injuries, Fred Strickland and Larry Kelm, the projected 
starters to replace Carl Ekern (retired) and Jim Collins/Mark Jerue (free 
agent/bad knee), practiced together this week for the first time since August. 
The Rams were left to reconsider draft decisions, then were forced to move 
outside linebackers Mel Owens and Frank Stams inside, which set off a chain 
reaction that affected the pass rush and the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Sunday's game against the Giants in Anaheim, the Ram defense ranks 
26th overall and 28th against the pass. The Rams have only 17 sacks. They had 
41 through nine games last season. The sack total and pass defense ranking 
relationship cannot be divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' top draft choice, defensive end Bill Hawkins, has not been the answer 
to the loss of Gary Jeter, who had 11 1/2 sacks in 1988 before becoming a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who was moved from defensive end to tackle, is still looking for his 
first sack. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams first tried playing their aggressive Eagle defense without Strickland 
and Kelm but were burned unmercifully, and they have pulled up stakes and 
rolled back into a familiar containment zone. Call it the Silver Stretch 
Defense. The Rams have at least managed to slow the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to be realists -- we were 28th against the pass," Irvin said of the 
recent adjustments. "In the Eagle they'd been getting us, and having big plays 
against us. We've got to change up, not because of the young guys, but because 
of a lot of the older guys, like some of the old guys who've been around a 
couple of times. . . . It's the old guys like me. And I'll take the heat." 
</P>
<P>
JIM EVERETT, YOUR HALO IS SLIPPING 
</P>
<P>
Everett's quarterback rating has dropped more than 20 points during the 
four-game losing streak, from 106.4 to 84.5. Is it all his fault? No. Robinson 
has drastically restricted the passing scheme in the past month to protect 
Everett against a succession of all-star pass-rush teams such as the Bills 
(Bruce Smith), the Saints (Pat Swilling), the Bears (Richard Dent), the Vikings 
(Keith Millard) and, this week, the Giants (Lawrence Taylor). 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have also tried to regain a ball-control offense. Still, Everett 
hasn't responded well enough to the sack pressure and has allowed his timing to 
be disrupted. However, when it counted in crunch time, Everett made the big 
plays to beat Buffalo and Minnesota, then watched his defense fail him. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Ernie Zampese remains the offensive coordinator and Robinson the 
coach, there will be conflict between pass and run. Robinson said his best 
teams at USC thrived on the friction between philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is so intent on keeping his team from becoming the free-wheeling San 
Diego Chargers of the early 1980s that he may be forcing the run issue without 
the kind of weapons he is used to owning. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, the Rams' running game has changed forever. Greg Bell is a good 
tailback but not in the same league as Eric Dickerson. The Ram offensive line 
is aging and can't hit like it used to hit during the week. The team practices 
in full pads only once a week. 
</P>
<P>
The running game is determination and will, Robinson says. But it seems will 
has given way to shorts and helmets four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
The running game can't be restored on command. It's becoming clear that Gaston 
Green is not a Robinson-type runner, and the strategy of using 1988's first 
draft pick on the former UCLA star gets stranger by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie tailback Cleveland Gary might be the answer as an inside runner, but his 
late arrival has taken him out of the 1989 picture. 
</P>
<P>
IS THERE TIME TO CATCH THE 49ERS? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, and it's not a mind-boggling scenario. The Rams, who have already beaten 
the 49ers once, need to pick up one game on San Francisco in the next four 
weeks to pull within two before their Dec. 11 showdown in Anaheim. Assuming 
that the Rams beat the 49ers again, a must in this formula, it would leave the 
Rams one game back with two remaining. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, a better road team than home team, closes the season with home 
games against the Bills and the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams close out with the Jets and the Patriots, relative patsies. The Rams 
would only need to finish in a tie with the 49ers for the division title, 
winning on the basis of sweeping the head-to-head series (if they win Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the 49ers may never lose again, the way they're going. And who knows 
when another Hail Mary pass will sneak through the Ram secondary? 
</P>
<P>
The most perplexing Ram season in recent memory rages on. And you can't say the 
coach didn't say it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of the 49er game, and this one (Minnesota), and the Buffalo 
game, yeah, those are hair-raisers," Robinson said.

'BO IV' TO PLAY IN LOYOLA GYM; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: A SUMMER OF INTENSIVE REHABILITATION HAS KIMBLE READY FOR A 
FINAL SEASON. HIS AIM: IMPRESS NBA SCOUTS AND SPARK THE LIONS' HIGH-POWERED 
ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a fictional Philadelphia predecessor -- Rocky -- Bo Kimble returned to his 
roots this summer and virtually lived in an inner-city gym, preparing for the 
biggest challenge of his career -- a comeback after an injury. 
</P>
<P>
In the first installment of "Bo," the cocky kid from Philly came West with his 
high school buddy, Hank Gathers, averaged more than 12 points for USC and made 
the Pacific 10 all-freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no happy ending. Kimble and Gathers left USC when it hired Coach 
George Raveling, transferring to Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo II" got off to a slow start but had a finish worthy of Sylvester Stallone. 
After missing much of the first month with a broken kneecap, Kimble came back 
and helped the Lions win 28 games, go undefeated in the West Coast Athletic 
Conference, upset Wyoming in the NCAA tournament and crack the top 20. Kimble 
led the WCAC in scoring in conference games, with 32 and 36 points in the two 
showdowns with rival Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
But "Bo III" found Kimble up against more adversity, with no one to slap some 
sense into him. Kimble slacked off on his knee exercises, and when practice 
began last fall, the joint became even more tender. 
</P>
<P>
After hobbling through a few games, Kimble underwent arthroscopic surgery and 
missed 13 games. Even though he came back and averaged nearly 17 points -- he 
scored 40 against Gonzaga -- he clearly favored the leg and was rarely as 
dominant as he had been. In the season finale he made only seven of 23 shots as 
Arkansas ousted the Lions from the NCAA tournament in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
This was a story that begged for one more sequel. So, in this corner, at 
6-foot-5, weighing 190 pounds, wearing the white trunks with the crimson and 
Columbia blue trim -- it's "Bo IV." 
</P>
<P>
Older, wiser and uninjured for perhaps the first time with Loyola, Kimble has 
already scripted its finish in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're gonna have a great season," he said. "I'm thankful I got another 
shot to come back. A lot of guys get hurt, they don't . . . get another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot to prove this year. There will be some shockers (upsets) this 
year. Now my main focus is for Loyola to win games. I hope to (get drafted) in 
the first round. I'm close enough now. If I put together a good year I 
shouldn't have a hard time making (the NBA). Eventually I will be playing in 
the NBA. My future is very promising. In Philly, they've seen I've been working 
on my game. Bo's back -- everyone knows Bo's back." 
</P>
<P>
The comeback trail starts with a heavyweight opponent Wednesday, an 
opening-round game in the Preseason National Invitation Tournament at Nevada 
Las Vegas. It's a matchup of the two most prolific scoring programs in NCAA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Vegas because they run like us," Kimble said. "I'm excited. Let's see 
who runs the most." 
</P>
<P>
In scrimmages and last week's exhibition against the Australian national team, 
a multifaceted Kimble has been on display -- not only showing his trademark 
high-arching shots from three-point range, but driving inside with authority, 
rebounding and passing. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive, perhaps, is Kimble's new maturity and serious approach. 
Never considered a wallflower, the engaging Kimble described his summer of 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"I made 500 to 1,000 jump shots every day, three-pointers only. I lifted 
weights on my knee. I did upper-body workouts. I hung out at the 12th Street 
Gym (in Philadelphia). I was there four to five hours every day unless I had a 
game. I was focused. I didn't want to do anything (else). I was a boring 
person. People didn't know what came over me." 
</P>
<P>
"Bo did everything he was supposed to this summer; you couldn't ask anything 
more," Loyola trainer Chip Schaefer said. "He worked hard. I'm seeing a Bo 
Kimble I haven't seen, functioning at a higher level than I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Lion Coach Paul Westhead said: "I can't remember in the last two years seeing 
Bo at practice Monday, working on something Tuesday and seeing it better on 
Thursday. He's either been injured and out or rehabilitating. Because of 
injury, he's always been trying to do his best, knowing he's not fully healthy. 
It becomes a situation where you kind of pick and choose, out of fear of 
reinjury. He's now back to his more natural approach to the game." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Kimble's game has been weak. After teaming with Gathers to win 
two Philadelphia city championships at Dobbins Tech, he came to California and 
has averaged 16.9 points in three collegiate seasons -- 19.9 at Loyola -- 
without ever having started more than 18 games. He goes into the season with 
1,219 points and has made 107 three-pointers in two seasons at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more, says Kimble, more even than Westhead knows. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble led Philadelphia's prestigious Sonny Hill Summer League in scoring this 
year, eclipsing consensus All-American Lionel Simmons of LaSalle among others. 
He returned to Loyola determined to show an all-around pro-style game, not just 
score. If he's drawing defenses, he helps create openings for Jeff Fryer, the 
team's other three-point specialist, and Gathers, who gets his points inside. 
In one game last season, the trio combined for 106 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite his reputation for being a shooter with no conscience, that's not 
close to the truth," Westhead said. "He loves to shoot, but he sees things and 
makes timely passes. He has that knack. He's not saying, 'I have to get my 
shots.' We all recognize he's a very good offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a number of ongoing talks . . . about things we need from him -- a 
timely amount of rebounds. There's no need to talk about the rainbow jump 
shots. An area (where) he can have great impact for us and himself is to show 
consistency on the defensive end. In practice, it's the best I've seen him at 
both ends. I think some of (his maturity) might be the result of the injury. 
He's seen things from a stop position. That may be one of the only pluses." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said that sitting had indeed been educational. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I've been in school longer than I have," he said. "I really 
learned a lot sitting on the sideline. I've seen if I could drive, it would 
make it better for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"When I am penetrating to the basket, I'm at my best. The reason I have not 
been driving in the past was, I was hurt. Now I'm able to finish off the play. 
I make the defense think about me, and that gets Fryer and Hank more shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's thinking 'Hank, Hank, Hank,' and he deserved it after the year he 
had. Now it's time for me to show what I can really do. L.A. and the scouts 
will get a chance to see Hank and me at the top of our games. I don't think I 
can be stopped. The only person who knows how much more I can give is Hank. 
Maybe Coach Westhead has a clue." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said: "I know nobody has seen Bo at full strength. There's gonna be 
some surprises for teams that think they can double- or triple-team me. He's 
gonna kill 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a barrage of moves down low. He's actually passing the ball more. Since 
ninth grade, I've been on Bo's back to pass more -- he draws defenses. Bo's 
gonna do his thing. I've just got to go to the glass. That's what I do anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bo) helps me," he said. "That's one more guy (defenses) have to concentrate 
on. That gets me more open shots. He complements my game and I complement his. 
There's no fight to get more shots. I'm not worried about being overshadowed. I 
want to win games. He makes us a lot better, being 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said: "I want to get a lot of assists. I'll know when it's time to turn 
it on. I think I can score every time I touch the ball. I could be selfish, but 
I want it to be fun for all the guys. I want the burden of leadership to fall 
on me. If we win games, everything else will take place for my career." 
</P>
<P>
Said Westhead: "His game is nearing its high level everyone expected. The thing 
I think he may need is a handful of games. What you have seen of Bo has been, 
perhaps, a shadow." 
</P>
<P>
But that's a different movie.

TROJANS AREN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM FACING ARIZONA

<P>
So, they hate USC Coach Larry Smith here? You obviously haven't been paying 
attention. That's old news in this town. 
</P>
<P>
For today's USC-Arizona game, there are newer, hotter feuds. Now it's time to 
hate Dick Tomey. Hate Ronald Veal. Hate the local media. Hate the local fans. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many locals taking potshots at so many other locals, it's hard to 
remember that the Trojans and Smith, the former Arizona coach, are supposed to 
be the enemies in a game that could decide the Pacific 10 Conference Rose Bowl 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be Arizona's biggest game ever. Never before had the Wildcats been 
in Rose Bowl contention this late in the season. They took the field against 
California last Saturday with a 4-1 conference record, pointing toward a 
showdown this week against USC, 5-0 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats raced to an early 21-0 lead, but behind quarterback Troy Taylor, 
Cal came back to win, 29-28, and the finger-pointing began. 
</P>
<P>
The fans and local media had already been criticizing Tomey, Arizona's coach, 
for a move he did not make the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Pacific by 24 points with less than six minutes to play, Tomey kept 
his first-string defense in the game. 
</P>
<P>
And wouldn't you know it? Free safety Jeff Hammerschmidt, the team leader in 
interceptions (four) and tackles (87), went down with a season-ending knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last week, redshirt freshman quarterback George Malauulu led Arizona into 
the 21-0 lead, passing for one touchdown and rushing for a second. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu had taken the starting job from Veal two games earlier by pulling out 
a win over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
With the big lead against Cal, Tomey saw an opportunity to give Veal playing 
time. Bad move, as it turned out. The Wildcats seemed to lose momentum and 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu, called back in to recapture the spark, tore knee ligaments and is out 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the criticism over yanking him has continued unabated all week from fans 
and the media alike. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," Tucson Citizen columnist Jack Rickard said, "like taking a pitcher 
out who had a no-hitter going after four innings." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Veal has gotten involved, blasting his critics.

<P>
"People were saying I can't move the ball," he told the Arizona Daily Star. "My 
record stands at 12-4. Try to explain that to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fans will jump on the bandwagon and jump off with every little thing you 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Into this caldron come the Trojans, ranked ninth in the nation with a 7-2 
overall mark and in need of just one victory or a tie to clinch their third 
consecutive Rose Bowl appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats' only chance is to beat USC, then win their final game against 
Arizona State at Tempe on Nov. 25, while hoping that UCLA can upset USC next 
Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely? Perhaps, but the feeling around here seems to be more like hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Rose Bowl race (is concerned), I think we're out of it," Arizona 
defensive lineman Anthony Smith said. "Whether USC plays good or not, there's 
no way they'll lose. They are a powerhouse team and there's nothing bad you can 
say about them." 
</P>
<P>
Even the fans seem caught up in the negativity. Despite the fact this could be 
the biggest game in Wildcat history, 5,000 seats remain unsold in 57,000-seat 
Arizona Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, everybody in town is disappointed that we didn't win last week," 
Tomey said. "But I think the fans will bounce back just like the players and 
coaches will, and we'll have a real a good environment out there." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy may swirl around the quarterback, but the Wildcats' chances seem to 
lie with the running game. 
</P>
<P>
This one figures to come down to one massive collision -- the nation's top 
rushing defense against the conference's top rushing offense. Two powerful 
forces digging in their heels. Who will budge first? 
</P>
<P>
USC has allowed an average of just 51.9 yards a game on the ground. The Trojans 
have given up minus 19 yards on the ground in their last two games. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of the season, they have faced pass-oriented teams. The only time 
they went up against a dominating running game, at Notre Dame, they were blown 
out. The Irish rushed for 266 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he'd ever before had a team hold the opposition to minus yardage on 
the ground two weeks in a row, Smith said he couldn't remember but added: "I 
don't think it'll happen this week. I'll tell you that. Not against these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
No argument there. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats are leading the Pac-10 in rushing for the third consecutive year, 
gaining an average of 245.2 yards a game on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
And they've gotten better recently. 
</P>
<P>
After using a wishbone offense for the first half of the season, Tomey switched 
to something called the I-bone for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't change the cards in your hand, just the way you play them. One of 
the two halfbacks lines up in the standard I formation. The idea was to get the 
ball to halfbacks David Eldridge and Errol Sapp more often. 
</P>
<P>
It has worked brilliantly from the first snap. 
</P>
<P>
In the three games before the UCLA game, Eldridge had 24 carries for 96 yards. 
Against the Bruins, he had 20 carries for 205 yards. It was the same for Sapp. 
He went from four carries for 11 yards in three games to 12 carries for 77 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Wildcats rushed for 480 yards against UCLA and amassed 504 yards 
of total offense. Arizona followed that with 512 total yards against Pacific 
and 412 total yards in the losing effort at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge, who will be slowed today by a pulled hamstring, leads the team in 
rushing with 629 yards, averaging 5.6 yards a carry, and has scored six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of rushing attack that could spread out the Trojan defense and 
cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats still figure to be overmatched, but to have any chance, they have 
to put all the controversy behind them and regain the intensity one assistant 
coach said they lost in the Cal game. 
</P>
<P>
Can they recapture the fiery days when Larry Smith's face adorned Tucson dart 
boards? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it's just not that simple anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC defensive lineman Randy Hord, sidelined last week because of a sprained 
ankle, has been upgraded to "possible" for today's game. . . . Arizona is 
loaded with injured players listed as questionable for today. They include 
defensive lineman Anthony Smith (separated shoulder), fullback Mario Hampton 
(broken hand), kicker Doug Pfaff (thigh), and offensive tackles Glenn Parker 
(bruised calf, sprained ankle) and John Fina (sprained knee). Tight end Pete 
Russell (torn abdominal muscle) is doubtful. Definitely out are linebacker Mike 
Parker (broken ankle), running back Art Greathouse (heel), fullback Devon 
Robinson (back) and safety Marion Bates (ankle).

MILLIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS STOLEN IN EXCHANGE FRAUD, BRAZIL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A criminal gang siphoned hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from Brazil's 
foreign exchange reserves in fraudulent financial operations that used 20 
commercial banks, including five in New York, to falsify documents for 
fictitious imports, Brazilian authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Federal police investigating the case have officially opened dozens of 
inquiries, including several Friday in Rio. Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma 
said he will send a team of federal police officers to the United States next 
week for further investigations there. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Saulo Ramos said in a Thursday news conference that the scam 
was "the biggest exchange fraud in the history of Brazil" and served as a way 
to launder money from drug trafficking. Ramos told reporters that the gang also 
may have helped companies in Brazil illegally remit profits from the country. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted a possibility of "involvement by high public officials in the 
operation." No government officials have been charged in the case, but Tuma 
said seven people indicted so far include an employee of the Banco do Estado de 
Paraiba, a commercial bank owned by a northeastern Brazilian state. 
</P>
<P>
Tupy Caldas de Moura, a Central Bank official, said the fictitious imports were 
documented under the names of corporations that existed only on paper. 
Investigators have found nearly 600 fraudulent import contracts, dating from 
1987, that drew an estimated $360 million from Brazilian dollar reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that all of the frauds were committed by the same gang, 
Moura said. "The irregularities found in the various operations are very 
similar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
New York banks named by Justice Minister Ramos were Manufacturers Hanover, Bank 
of New England, First New York Bank for Business, First Woman's Bank and a U.S. 
office of the Brazilian bank Bamerindus. Ramos also named 15 banks in Brazil 
and six brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
"The bankers will have to help in the investigations since they all have 
responsibility, at least for lack of vigilance," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Wallace Cochrane Jr., president of the Federation of Bank Assns. of Brazil, 
said the fraudulent operations began with falsified government documents that 
cannot be blamed on banks. 
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of the banks is zero," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how officials say the scheme worked: 
</P>
<P>
A "drone" working for the gang filled out a form requesting an import permit 
from the government bureau of foreign trade, known as Cacex. Once the permit 
was approved, the gang altered figures on it to increase the value of the 
import. 
</P>
<P>
With the permit, the gang obtained a document called a "declaration of 
importation" from another government office. A financial broker delivered the 
permit and the declaration to the exchange department of a commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, someone claiming to represent a fictitious exporting company in the 
United States had a bank in New York send a false invoice and bill of lading to 
the bank in Brazil. With the documents from both ends of the false transaction, 
the bank in Brazil accepted a check in Brazilian cruzados from the "importer" 
and completed an exchange contract, telexing an order of payment in dollars to 
the U.S. "exporter." 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the payment in cruzados by the gang violated Central Bank 
regulations requiring such payments to be made from an account in the importing 
company's name. Instead, the gang used cashiers checks, checks payable to the 
bearer and even cash. 
</P>
<P>
Because the dollars were purportedly for authorized imports, they were drawn at 
the official exchange rate from the Central Bank, as required for all 
international transactions. Later, the gang brought some of the same dollar 
funds back to Brazil and traded them on the black market at a premium rate that 
sometimes is more than double the official rate.

TAGGART TESTIMONY IN DOUBT AMID NEW REVELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New revelations Friday cast doubt on congressional testimony this week by 
former California Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart on his 
financial ties to a failed Texas thrift and his decision while commissioner to 
grant speculative investment powers to Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations suggest that a personal loan provided to Taggart was used by a 
now-defunct Texas thrift to invest in a California savings and loan without 
proper regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures also show that Taggart approved broader investment powers for 
Lincoln in 1984 after being named a director of a San Diego company that 
Lincoln invested in a short time later. Lincoln's risky investments were a key 
factor in its subsequent failure, an event that will cost taxpayers as much as 
$2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Taggart denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony Tuesday before the House Banking Committee, Taggart 
acknowledged that Vernon Savings &amp; Loan -- a high-flying thrift that was 
closed in 1987 amid federal allegations that it was looted by its officers -- 
bought a 1985 loan of his from San Diego National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart planned to use the $600,000 loan to buy a one-third stake in Shelter 
Island Savings Bank, a fledging San Diego thrift that never opened because it 
was unable to get federal deposit insurance. Taggart, the state's top thrift 
regulator in 1983 and 1984, was working as a consultant then. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart told the committee that he discovered Vernon's connection to the loan 
"when I started getting statements from Vernon Savings and started asking 
questions." Taggart said in his testimony that he borrowed money from the San 
Diego bank and found out subsequently that the note had been sold to Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
But two bank memos obtained by The Times show that Vernon's purchase of the 
loan was arranged at the time it was funded in September, 1985. One memo, 
written in August, 1985, by a former senior officer at the San Diego bank, said 
Vernon would assume the note by the end of 1985. Another, written by former 
Vernon President Patrick G. King in September, 1985, specifies that Vernon 
would pay $620,000 for the Taggart loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Vernon and Taggart were in the loan at the same time. It was up front, 
not after the fact as he indicated in his testimony," said committee member 
Rep. Richard Lehman (D-Sanger). 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday night, Taggart repeated that he was unaware of Vernon's 
involvement. "I didn't know about it at the time the loan was taken out," 
Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
The loan arrangement with Vernon, along with other loan-related memos, raises 
questions about whether Vernon was trying to invest through Taggart in Shelter 
Island Savings without proper regulatory approvals. A separate memo obtained by 
The Times, written by a Vernon loan officer in July, 1986, states that the 
purpose of the transaction was "for Mr. Taggart to purchase a savings and loan 
institution in San Diego on Vernon's behalf." 
</P>
<P>
Taggart denied that the purpose of the loan was to make thrift investments for 
Vernon. "That is the very first time I've ever heard that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart worked for Vernon in 1986 as a $10,000-a-month consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Friday, San Diego financier Thomas C. Stickel is 
disputing Taggart's congressional testimony on when he joined Stickel's TCS 
Enterprises financial services firm in San Diego as a director, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel, quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, said Taggart was named a TCS 
director effective November, 1984. That contradicts Taggart's testimony that he 
became a TCS director on Jan. 1, 1985, when he also became president of a TCS 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The date Taggart joined TCS is significant because it would show he had 
business ties to the firm on Dec. 7, 1984, the date he authorized Lincoln 
Savings to invest $800 million in speculative investments. A little more than a 
month after Taggart's decision, Lincoln provided TCS a cash infusion of $2.9 
million in exchange for a 20% stake. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel was traveling and could not be reached for comment. But James B. 
Kylstad, a TCS executive vice president, confirmed that Taggart was named a 
director that November. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Taggart said that he had no involvement with TCS until 1985 
and that the November date on Securities and Exchange Commission documents is 
wrong. In an interview, Taggart said he knew he would be joining TCS at the 
time of the Lincoln decision but said it was unrelated to his action. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Lincoln executives) didn't have the slightest idea I was going with 
TCS," Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said that even though he knew he would join the firm, he was not active 
with it until 1985.

WHAT REFORMS IN EAST GERMANY MEAN FOR BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: SOME ANALYSTS ARE PREDICTING A 'SECOND ECONOMIC MIRACLE' SIMILAR TO 
THE POSTWAR RECOVERY. BUT THERE COULD BE SHORT-TERM PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
What does it mean for business that the Berlin Wall is down, figuratively 
speaking, and East Germans are free to travel to the West? 
</P>
<P>
There was not much doubt among German economic and financial analysts on Friday 
that the end of the Wall promises a great boon to the economy of West Germany 
and by extension to all of Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also an awareness that freedom to travel did not mean 
reunification of Germany -- the Soviet Union has ruled out a change of borders. 
And there was recognition too that the poverty and backwardness of the 17 
million people who live in Communist East Germany pose short-term problems for 
West Germany -- the nation of 61 million that, since World War II, has become 
one of the world's most prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the hopes ran high for "a second economic miracle," as one financial 
analyst put it, recalling the original miracle of West Germany's postwar 
recovery. "It means the 1990s will be politically and economically the most 
rewarding decade of the 20th Century," said a German banker. 
</P>
<P>
Few mentioned it specifically but for many West Germans the end of the Wall, 
like the whole recent process of change in the Soviet Bloc, means the end of 
fear. For all its prosperity -- and the presence of American troops -- West 
Germany has been the most insecure country in Europe. West German businessmen 
became infamous in the 1970s for secretly sending money out of the country, 
because they feared an ultimate Soviet invasion. The wealthiest West Germans 
built their houses near the autobahn -- to allow for a fast getaway. 
</P>
<P>
Lately such fears have been fading. And they were nowhere in evidence Friday as 
traders on the Frankfurt stock exchange eagerly bought up stocks of department 
store chains and cement companies, reckoning that newly arriving East Germans 
meant a housing and retailing boom. There were predictions that the West German 
economy -- the world's fourth largest at $1.8 trillion in gross national 
product -- would grow by about $80 billion more in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen will benefit, said some analysts, because East Germans can now 
replace their Brebant cars -- "They have a small engine, like a motorcycle," 
sneered a West German. 
</P>
<P>
Just where East Germans would live and do their spending, however, posed an 
interesting question. The end of the Wall could mean a slowdown in refugees, 
said Heiko Thieme, investment strategist for the Deutsche Bank, West Germany's 
largest financial institution. "They will be able to commute to jobs in West 
Germany and go home at night to the East," he said. Indeed, officials of East 
and West Germany have begun to negotiate increased bus and subway service 
between the two zones of Berlin -- the divided city of 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
So sunny prospects of East Germans as new consumers was the dominant theme in 
West German reaction. 
</P>
<P>
But there were minor chords of caution too. One was that the problem of 
subsidizing and housing East German refugees -- many of whom whom are now 
sleeping in West German schools -- would increase inflation in the West German 
economy. In fact, while German stocks rose on the Frankfurt exchange, the West 
German deutsche mark declined on world currency markets Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody doubted the East Germans were eager to buy -- "some of them come to West 
Berlin just to buy bananas and M&amp;Ms," said one observer. But whether they 
had the money was another question. So many East German marks are flooding into 
West Germany that their value has declined by half in recent days -- from the 
equivalent of 6.5 U.S. cents to 3.3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
And as a pool of new labor for the West German industrial machine, the 
Easterners have surprisingly few skills, said Hauke Andresen, a vice president 
of DG Securities, an arm of the largest West German savings bank. "I know a man 
who hired a plumber from the East, but he couldn't work with copper pipes 
because they don't have them in East Germany," Andresen said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was an underlying confidence that a historic process was under way 
and would not be turned back. 
</P>
<P>
Politics and economics were working in tandem to see that that was so. The fact 
that money would be needed to help the East Germans meant that the West German 
Bundesbank -- and by implication other Western central banks -- would not 
tighten money supplies, said a banker. "High interest rates could cause a 
setback here." 
</P>
<P>
And several West German financial analysts said the fact that President Bush 
was meeting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Dec. 2 meant that progress would 
continue. "Gorbachev is broke," said a German banker, "he can't admit it but he 
needs Bush's help." 
</P>
<P>
But in another sense the thousands of East Germans who have already crossed to 
the West and the hundreds of thousands who have marched in East Berlin and 
Leipzig tore the openings in the Wall that were being formally dug by West 
Berlin municipal employees Friday night. And they also provided the spark that 
may make the 1990s a "politically and economically rewarding decade."

Federated Group Talks Called Off: Fretter Inc., a Midwestern consumer 
electronics retailer, said it has called off negotiations to acquire Atari 
Corp.'s ailing Federated Group chain. A Fretter spokesman said his company had 
been negotiating to buy all 40 Federated consumer electronics stores, but when 
Atari agreed this week to sell its 26 Southern California stores to Silo Inc. 
of Philadelphia, Fretter was no longer interested in purchasing the remaining 
outlets.

ACTIVISTS HAIL 'MIDNIGHT CALLER' SEQUEL; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE COMMUNITY THAT PROTESTED THE FIRST EPISODE OF AN AIDS DRAMA 
COOPERATES WITH PRODUCERS ON THE SECOND. 
</P>

<P>
Almost a year ago, NBC broadcast a controversial "Midnight Caller" episode 
about a bisexual man living in San Francisco who knows he is infected with the 
AIDS virus but continues to have reckless sexual affairs -- including an 
encounter with the former lover of radio talk-show host Jack Killian. 
</P>
<P>
In an early draft of the script, Killian (series star Gary Cole) was to shoot 
and kill the promiscuous man, until angry AIDS activists temporarily halted 
production of the San Francisco-based show and persuaded producers to make 
story revisions. Then, still unhappy with the changes, the protesters 
demonstrated at a San Francisco TV station the night it aired. 
</P>
<P>
The debated episode stirred a hornet's nest of publicity and raised larger 
questions about the inaccurate depiction of AIDS by the entertainment industry, 
a practice the AIDS community contends leads to widespread fear, discrimination 
and violence toward gays and people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, TV viewers will see the sequel to that fateful episode, which won 
Kay Lenz an Emmy Award for her performance as the woman with AIDS. But in 
contrast to the uproar over the first episode, the offices of "Midnight 
Caller," which is produced by Lorimar Television, are relatively quiet this 
time around. There are no phones ringing off the hook, no demonstrators blowing 
whistles on the set and no temporary restraining orders being issued. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the same members of the AIDS community who so bitterly 
protested "Midnight Caller" last year are singing praises of the show's 
producers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Why the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cooperative effort from the get-go," executive producer Bob Singer 
said. "We went to the groups who protested us last year and told them we were 
planning on doing a sequel and that we wanted their help." 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was feeling fairly cynical and wasn't expecting a lot," said 
Michelle Roland, a member of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP. 
She was recalling her early meeting with Singer and writer-producer Stephen 
Zito, who wrote both AIDS episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephen walked in saying, 'I know ACT-UP won't be happy with anything we do 
because it's a script about AIDS,' " Roland said. "I said, 'Whoa! You need to 
understand, we're happy that people do shows about AIDS. We're not irrational 
activists causing trouble because we don't have anything to do.' When we see a 
specific concern or problem, we respond to it. But given the chance, we'd much 
rather engage in constructive dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem last year was that the cast and crew of "Midnight Caller," 
now in its second season, were newcomers to the Bay Area. They were looked upon 
as Hollywood intruders trying to exploit a sensitive community issue. So for 
this season's episode, the producers funneled their efforts through the San 
Francisco AIDS Foundation, which put them in touch with several AIDS 
organizations. Zito spent nearly six months researching and writing the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such amazingly controversial material," Zito said, "and the controversy 
sometimes surfaces where you least expect it -- even over language. To give you 
the simplest example, you don't want to call people who have the disease 
victims of AIDS, because they don't want to be seen as victims. That's an 
important distinction. When you start feeling sorry for them, they cease to 
become people. They are people with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
In the new episode, which Zito describes as a simple love story, Lenz returns 
in the later stages of the disease. Of the approximate 100,000 people in the 
United States who have been diagnosed with AIDS, about 10% are women, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control. To learn what it is like to be a woman with 
AIDS, Lenz spent numerous sessions with a female support group -- which also 
helped Zito with his script. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was very emotional," the 36-year-old actress said. "It was so hard 
sitting in the room looking at these women who were total strangers to me, 
sharing the most intimate details about themselves. As I spent more time with 
them, the emotions died down and I got angry. It's such a tragic illness 
because of the prejudice attached to it. It's harder to live with AIDS than it 
is with cancer because there is no sympathy, only fear. Women's husbands 
abandon them. Their family doctors stop seeing them. Some women don't tell 
anybody, even their own children." 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by the final script," said Catherine Maier, the support 
group's facilitator and women's services program coordinator for the San 
Francisco AIDS Foundation. "It was compassionate and speaks to the strength of 
these women, and how difficult it is to get through each day. It becomes a 
career. The women wanted to make sure that their lives were portrayed 
accurately and sensitively. They even visited the set, and they were pleased 
with what they saw." 
</P>
<P>
Lenz's premature death in the episode, however, was a tough concept for the 
AIDS groups to get behind. With new treatments, many people with AIDS are 
living longer, eight years or more. There was concern that compacting the life 
expectancy of a person diagnosed with AIDS could prove dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"To the degree that our society believes that people with HIV infection will 
die, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Paul Boneberg, executive 
director of Mobilization Against AIDS, a political lobby group. "We're involved 
in a strategy of hope, telling people that they need not die. They can fight 
and seek treatment." 
</P>
<P>
To help explain Lenz's early death, the story focuses on treatment issues and 
access to care. The episode illustrates how rapidly an AIDS patient can 
deteriorate without proper life-sustaining medication -- which is often 
expensive and difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize that this is not the anguished cries of the doomed they 
are hearing," Boneberg said. "People with AIDS can't get to the drug treatments 
that might save their lives because there's profiteering by pharmaceutical 
companies and gross negligence by the health establishment." 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, it's against network policy to negotiate with special interest 
groups to determine the content of a show. But executive producer Singer said 
that NBC gave Lorimar producers its blessing to enlist the assistance of AIDS 
groups, partly because the network wanted to avoid the controversy that arose 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the word negotiation is the incorrect word," Singer said. "That word 
has a certain charge to it. NBC wanted something that was accurate and that 
they could stand behind. The AIDS community was able to supply us with the 
information we needed." 
</P>
<P>
Although the episode tried to address each AIDS group's unique concerns, it did 
not meet every agenda. Boneberg and Mobilization Against AIDS wanted Lenz's 
character to become a political activist. Roland of ACT-UP said the show used 
mostly one-liners to sum up complex issues. And Rene Durazzo, media relations 
coordinator for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, points out that by zeroing 
in on a woman with AIDS, the episode largely neglects the story of the gay 
male, who still comprises about 61% of all reported AIDS cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to deal within the dramatic context of our show," Zito said. "I can 
only write about relationships that I know. That may be bad politics, but it's 
good drama." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from minor differences, the overwhelming response from the AIDS community 
is positive. The TV producers and AIDS groups involved expressed hope that this 
episode of "Midnight Caller" will establish a precedent in future shows 
depicting AIDS. And they all emphasized the need for more programming. There 
are projections that the total number of AIDS cases reported since 1978 will 
double in the next 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The story is extremely passionate and understanding in how it deals with the 
whole epidemic," Durazzo said. "This is a very positive model, and a process we 
hope other producers will look at doing. Our feeling is that it served the 
needs of the producers from the standpoint of developing quality, entertaining 
programming. And it served the needs of the AIDS community because it produced 
an accurate script that can only foster more understanding in the public."

ARTISTS' OUTLOOK: AN OVERCROWDED LANDSCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: STUDIES SHOW THAT WITH MORE PEOPLE ENTERING CREATIVE FIELDS, 
ARTISTS ARE FACING DIMINISHED OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Artists in all media confront a dreary future of more competition for 
diminished rewards, a collection of new studies finds. 
</P>
<P>
Hamstrung by a decline in real earnings nearly five times that of professions 
in general and with more and more people entering creative fields, artists 
vanish uncounted and unaccounted for into such occupations as restaurant waiter 
or waitress and taxicab driver. 
</P>
<P>
"What I see is massive numbers of the supply side (of arts professionals) 
coming out of our colleges and universities and very few jobs that are paying 
jobs and are available," said Milton Rhodes, president of the New York-based 
American Council for the Arts, which is publishing the new results. 
</P>
<P>
"The economist would say that's the way supply and demand works, but the truth 
of the matter is that, if you aren't discovered (in the arts), you never have a 
chance to really show your stuff and bring to the fore the talent that's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The studies also show that the disparity between earnings of men and women 
employed in the same or nearly identical arts jobs is greater than in the 
American work force at large. One study of earnings trends and patterns between 
1970 and 1980 found that while 75% of dancers are women, they earned only 66% 
the amount male performers get, while women painters and sculptors average less 
than half of what men earn. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new research, which draws on government and private data, finds 
that available statistical tools have failed to monitor arts-employment 
patterns and trends to such an extent that reliable conclusions are often 
impossible to make. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, government data released earlier this year by the National 
Endowment for the Arts show that unemployment among actors and directors 
increased last year from 7.7% to 10.6%, but was still down from a historic high 
of 15.7% in 1983. In contrast, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild said 
that 85% of the union's members are out of work at any given time. The union 
says that 80% of its 110,000 members are forced to earn living expenses working 
in other fields. 
</P>
<P>
California Institute of the Arts has played a pioneer role in the still-small 
movement to establish arts courses oriented toward business practices, money 
management and employment enhancement. The Valencia school said that a survey 
of its alumni found 90% reporting that they are doing at least some work in the 
arts. Underscoring how difficult it is to track how many artists actually earn 
their livings in creative fields, CalArts said only 69.8% of its graduates said 
they were actually employed in a field related to their majors. 
</P>
<P>
The only existing national databases with raw materials for such surveys are 
maintained by the federal Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But 
the official figures, experts involved in the new research agree, are flawed 
because do not identify many arts professionals who are not employed full time 
in creative fields. 
</P>
<P>
They also include bizarre classification criteria in which, for instance, 
theater and motion-picture directors and actors are lumped together in one 
group but musicians are split arbitrarily between those playing in "restaurants 
and nightclubs" or "bands and orchestras" with no regard to which of them may 
be recording. 
</P>
<P>
That the economic and employment picture in creative professions should be so 
unfavorable appears to defy otherwise healthy financial circumstances for the 
arts in general. But John P. Robinson, a sociology professor and director of 
the Survey Research Center at the University of Maryland, contends that the 
situation presents artists with a significant anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests an interesting and familiar trend as far as artists in America 
are concerned," Robinson concluded in a new book of essays and reports on the 
condition of American artists. It is, he argued, "a trend which may be 
summarized as 'more interest, less money.' It might also be characterized as 
'more competition, less profit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it would be a mistake to place extensive trust in hard statistics 
on arts employment. He said the few figures that are available may be suspect 
because government statistical categories simply aren't specific enough to 
evaluate what artists may be doing. 
</P>
<P>
"This field is completely in a vacuum. There are no answers to many of the 
questions," he said in a telephone interview. "How many people are recorded in 
the design field but who are designers of store windows? It's very hard to know 
what's been happening." 
</P>
<P>
The new reports, including one essay by the acting director of the research 
office at the National Endowment for the Arts, are included in "The Modern 
Muse: The Support and Condition of Artists," a new anthology that grew out of a 
seminar on artist conditions held in Baltimore last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists are unemployed and underemployed for longer periods of time than other 
kinds of 'normal' occupations," said C. Richard Swaim, a government and public 
administration professor at the University of Baltimore and editor of "The 
Modern Muse." "I think that we -- meaning the American society -- cannot 
envision the artist as a regular occupation, like a plumber or an electrician. 
We have trouble doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the new studies found that: 
</P>
<P>
The number of people working in arts professions -- ranging from architecture 
and advertising to painting, sculpture and acting -- rose 84% between 1972 and 
1986, to 1.179 million, and is expected to increase another 31% by the turn of 
the century. The total civilian work force grew by 33% between 1972 and 1986 
and is expected to increase by 19% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The largest increases in arts professions between now and the turn of the 
century will be among restaurant and nightclub dancers and choreographers 
(42%), artists employed by advertising agencies (52%) and advertising and 
commercial art design (58%). Employment of actors and directors in the 
motion-picture industry will go up 33% and musicians as a group will increase 
28%. 
</P>
<P>
While pressure from the women's movement helped to equalize wages paid to males 
and females for the same work, arts professions -- sometimes perceived as a 
bastion of opportunity for women -- lagged seriously behind the work force as a 
whole in wage equality. In 1980 -- in addition to the disparity between male 
and female dancers -- women painters and sculptors, who made up 48% of the 
profession, earned only 48% as much as their male counterparts. Women musicians 
and composers -- 30% of the category -- earned 45% of the wages paid to men. In 
the work force as a whole, 43% female in 1980, women got 70% of the pay for men 
in similar positions. In the arts, where women make up 38% of the work force, 
they got 42% of what men received. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in people entering arts professions is likely to be matched by a 
continuing decline in real earnings among artists. The arts professions 
sustained an overall 37% decline in real earnings -- the actual buying power of 
annual wages -- in the 1970s. Real earnings trends for the 1980s will not be 
available until completion of the 1990 census, according to the NEA. For the 
work force as a whole in the 1970s, the decline was 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Some artist categories were especially hard hit by the real earnings decline, 
with painters and sculptors recording an estimated 62% drop in their incomes 
during the 1970s. Actors and directors actually showed a 7% increase in real 
income -- the only group of creative workers to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings decline for visual artists -- designers showed an estimated 87% 
decline in real earnings and photographers went down 34% -- occurred during an 
era in which the products of visual-arts media became perceived as market 
commodities. In turn, concluded Richard Harvey Brown, also of the University of 
Maryland Survey Research Center, "a star system developed among artists. Most 
were unemployed while a few became rich celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Baca, a prominent local muralist and director of the Social and Public Art 
Resource Center in Venice, said that the visual-arts star system has trapped 
many mid-career artists in poverty. The money in art, said Baca, has 
increasingly gravitated to young artists who become hot very early in their 
careers or to older artists who gain recognition late in their careers. Artists 
who fail to achieve instant stardom in their 20s, said Baca in an interview, 
face overwhelming odds of being mired in poverty during their most productive 
working decades. 
</P>
<P>
Both Robinson and Tom Bradshaw, the NEA's acting research director, cautioned 
that the trends observed in the new essays are the product of data that is, at 
best, of questionable accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson said that it is still possible to make valid general observations: 
There are likely to be more people going into creative fields in which 
employment will also increase, but not at a pace nearly quick enough to absorb 
everyone who wants to work in them, and probably with the result that economic 
competition will continue to undercut the financial life styles of artists. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson, said Robinson, is: "Artist beware."

RACING: THE FIFTH ANNUAL PALM SPRINGS VINTAGE GRAND PRIX, WHICH HAS RISEN IN

On Thursday, Rolling Hills businessman John Delane will step into the narrow 
cockpit of his 29-year-old Lotus 18 Formula Jr. to begin a weekend of vintage 
car racing in Palm Springs. The blue-and-white 1960 Lotus is a single-seater 
built in England and has a top speed of about 130 m.p.h. and a value equal to a 
comfortable annual wage. 
</P>
<P>
Delane is one of several hundred drivers of vintage competition cars who will 
take part in the annual Palm Springs Vintage Grand Prix. The street festival of 
speed, nostalgia and car worship, sponsored this year by Avanti Automotive 
Corp., has become a "must do" for Southern California car buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Avanti, for those with short memories, is the sole survivor of the defunct 
Studebaker Corp. Avanti has a history in Palm Springs through the late famed 
designer Raymond Loewy, who drew the car at his home there. The Avanti that was 
Loewy's personal car will be on hand during the Grand Prix weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Vintage Grand Prix is in its fifth year. Though the races are the most 
visible parts of the event, they aren't its only attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Equally interesting are a high-dollar car auction, a two-day automotive beauty 
pageant called concours d'elegance, nostalgia drag racing on a closed city 
street and the final round of a professional single-seat, open-wheel 
(fenderless) class of modern cars called Formula Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Delane is probably typical of most vintage car competitors when he admits to 
having a Walter Mitty attraction to racing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 16," he says, "my family moved from Santa Maria (Calif.) to France. 
That was in 1958. And in the spring I crammed myself into the back of a 356 
Porsche coupe and went to the 24-hour race at Le Mans with some neighbors. It 
was wonderful, and I was bitten big-time by the car bug." 
</P>
<P>
Delane describes himself as conservative -- a label that may suit his role as a 
44-year-old husband, father and CEO of Del-Jen Inc., an international company 
with headquarters in Palos Verdes that does contract work for the U.S. 
military. Because of the pressures of business and family, wheel-to-wheel 
racing wasn't part of Delane's life until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like the most about vintage racing," he says, "is that it's the perfect 
hobby for me. My work is often tedious and filled with administrative details, 
and being a weekend racer in an old car on skinny tires completely absorbs me 
so I don't think about business." 
</P>
<P>
Racing on skinny tires, the same sizes used on competition cars during the '50s 
and '60s, is important because skinny tires slide, drift and generally react 
the way modern racing slicks do, only at speeds far lower than those of the 
cars that compete in faster, higher-stress events. 
</P>
<P>
"Vintage racing is more about the cars than their drivers because most of the 
cars have become pieces of art and bigger parts of history than most of the 
drivers," says Delane. 
</P>
<P>
Many fans agree that each car has a lore that is painstakingly researched and 
can often be recited by owners. That doesn't mean all the cars are more famous 
than their owners. The Palm Springs vintage weekend, which has risen in 
prestige every year, now attracts an impressive group of racing names as well 
as cars. 
</P>
<P>
This year, expect to see racing legends George Follmer, a Trans-Am and Can-Am 
champion, and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Roger Ward. Augie Pabst of 
Scarab fame will drive a 1960 Formula One Lotus 18, the more powerful version 
of Delane's car. Bob Bondurant, an ex-Cobra team driver, will be in a restored 
427-cubic-inch Cobra. 
</P>
<P>
Follmer and Parnelli Jones, two of racing's toughest competitors, will be in 
cars they raced in the Trans-Am series during the '60s. Jones will drive a '69 
Mustang and Follmer a '67 version. Venerable British expatriate Brian Redman, 
who is a Can-Am and Formula 5000 champion, will drive a powerful 1971 Lola 212 
Can-Am car. 
</P>
<P>
For these racing greats, being asked to drive one of their original racing cars 
is as much a step down Memory Lane as it is just plain fun. Picture Roger Ward, 
Follmer and Jones in the cars that made them famous. 
</P>
<P>
At more intense racing events, spectators are distanced from the action by 
walls, fences and a complex system of credentials. But at Palm Springs, fans 
should feel almost like participants because many of the grandstands -- though 
in safe areas -- are so located that ticket holders can feel the ground shake 
from the unmuffled roar of horsepower and smell the hot metal, oil and rubber. 
</P>
<P>
Delane knows how compelling being close to the action can be. 
</P>
<P>
"When my daughter Megan graduated from high school," he says, "we offered her a 
choice of a trip to Hawaii, a college wardrobe or a course at the Jim Russell 
racing school at Riverside. She chose the Jim Russell school and we went 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great fun, and it also was the final step in my getting on the track in 
a vintage car. I borrowed my daughter's MGB, had it prepared for competition 
and raced it for a season before I gave it back." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sheehan is another person who will race an open-wheel car at Palm Springs 
next weekend. His approach to racing is different from that of Delane. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's car is a Formula One Tyrrell 007 built in 1974 that does not race on 
skinny tires. He found his car in Italy, where it was entered in vintage racing 
events by an Italian industrialist after Team Tyrrell retired it from 
international Formula One competition in 1976. Sheehan is a serious competitor 
who enters a Chevrolet Camaro in the International Motor Sports GTO class 
against some of the best sports car drivers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I like vintage events," he says, "is because this is the only place 
I can drive a car that at one time was the ultimate race car. In my opinion, 
there is nothing that rivals Formula One, and I'm too old and not good enough 
to even dream about racing a current Formula One car. After all, there are only 
about 40 people in the world who can. So I compete in an older Formula One car 
at vintage races. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this kind of racing isn't about winning, and I really don't care if 
I do win, but I try as hard as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who owns European Auto Sales in Costa Mesa, expects that trying hard 
will get him to speeds as high as 150 m.p.h. at Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheehan and Delane, Palm Springs is the second most prestigious 
vintage event in the West and the No. 1 street race in which cars thread 
between unforgiving concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
"In a few years I think Palm Springs will be as big a deal as the historic 
races in Monterey," says Sheehan. "Monterey still is No. 1 because it's older, 
is a different kind of track and has more tradition. But the great appeal of 
Palm Springs is that it's close to Los Angeles and has great hotels, 
restaurants and shopping, so it's easy to bring your family along. 
</P>
<P>
"And for people from the Midwest or the East, having it be warm is no bad 
thing. This weekend is as much social as it is about cars. I suppose from an 
automotive standpoint, you could think of it as Monterey with cactus." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Palm Springs officials work to create a festive atmosphere of 
varied automotive events. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m. Thursday, promoter Rick Cole will begin a sports and racing car 
auction that is expected to attract prospective buyers and sellers from as far 
away as Europe and Japan. Cole's auctions are as much theater as bazaar, and 
$12.50 buys a ticket to the show. The action is fast, loud and exciting, and it 
is not unusual to see millions of dollars change hands as 100 or so mostly 
stunning cars roll through the auction area. 
</P>
<P>
Another traditional event, though not usually part of vintage racing weekends, 
is a two-day concours d'elegance. (A concours is a beauty competition for 
interesting and elegant automobiles.) Tickets are $12.50. Serious concours 
participation means showing up with a car that has passed from mere 
transportation to objet d'art and displaying it for spectators and judges in an 
often pastoral setting. 
</P>
<P>
To approach a 100-point score, a car must be perfect, with each wire, stitch 
and color authentic and spotless. An unskilled eye shouldn't find a speck of 
dirt, grime or grease anywhere. Concours events, like vintage races, have a 
class for just about every car, and it's reasonable to expect anything from 
early Fords and Chevies to Bugattis, Duesenbergs, Cobras and Delahayes. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to enjoy the Palm Springs vintage weekend is to think of it as an 
automotive smorgasbord and sample a little of everything. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a program and read the race schedule, picking out the events that include 
your favorite cars. In addition to pure racing machines -- the kind driven by 
John Delane, Mike Sheehan, Parnelli Jones and Roger Ward -- there are dozens of 
production cars, GT cars, antiques, sports racers, sedans and specials. They 
race in groups, not necessarily with any logic except to the organizers, so 
each race is an eclectic mix of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
At a vintage racing event, understand that speed is OK, rough driving isn't, 
and any driver who is overly aggressive goes to the sidelines for as long as a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Activities center on the temporary race circuit on Tahquitz Road near the 
airport. The Wyndham Resort Hotel is the social center for most participants, 
and if you want to hear car talk all you need to do is wander around its public 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Also, don't overlook the parking lots, where you'll see cars more interesting 
and exciting than at most American auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
The "star-studded" show and dinner Saturday at the Palm Springs Convention 
Center costs $75 a ticket. Tickets for a four-day VIP grandstand seat and 
access to the paddock areas are $60. The Palm Springs version of a four-day 
coach seat costs $45, and $20 gets you in on any single day. Call (619) 
322-7223 for additional information.

BOB GREENE: A NEW NOTE IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you think of American history books, what comes to mind is volumes filled 
with lofty and exalted names out of our nation's illustrious past: George 
Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But a new scholarly work, written by Richard Aquila, a professor of history at 
Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., contains some names that probably have 
not appeared in previous studies of the United States and its historic legacy: 
the Ronettes, Paul and Paula, the Hollywood Argyles, Eddie Cochran, Ferlin 
Husky. 
</P>
<P>
The book, from the looks of its cover, appears to be a lighthearted piece of 
fluff; it is called "That Old Time Rock &amp; Roll," and the cover art is of 
the parking lot of an ice cream stand. But the subtitle is "A Chronicle of an 
Era: 1954-1963," and Aquila insists that his intention was for the book to be a 
learned and serious examination of that era of American history. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first decade of rock 'n' roll," Aquila said. "The image of young 
Americans of that era is of people in motorcycle jackets, carrying switch-blade 
knives. The truth, though, is that although there were certainly signs of 
rebellion, for the most part it was a conservative era, and the rock 'n' roll 
songs reflected traditional values regarding the family unit, religion and 
anti-communism." 
</P>
<P>
For supporting evidence, the professor fills 370 pages with examples and 
analysis of the music of the times. "Take the song 'Mama Said,' " the professor 
advised, referring to a 1961 tune by the Shirelles. "Rather than showing 
rebellion against a parent, 'Mama Said' points out a desire for a close 
relationship with the mother. The mama has said that there will be 'days like 
this' -- and the child knows that the mother is right." 
</P>
<P>
Relationships between males and females are mirrored in the songs of the era, 
Aquila said. "One of the best examples is 'I Will Follow Him,' " the professor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
(Columnist's note: "I Will Follow Him" was released by a vocalist named Little 
Peggy March in 1963, and if you had ventured the thought back then that one day 
Little Peggy March would appear in a history book, you would have been laughed 
at. Come on now. Little Peggy March.) " 'I Will Follow Him' reflected the 
common notion of the time that women must be subservient to men," Aquila said. 
"Little Peggy March sings that she will 'follow him' regardless of where 'he' 
goes -- over mountains, oceans. She keeps repeating: 'I love him, I love him, I 
love him, and where he goes, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was different for males. Dion presents an interesting example. In 
'Runaround Sue,' Dion is referring to a girl who fools around with other guys. 
And what is Dion's message? 'Stay away from my Runaround Sue.' Runaround Sue is 
considered bad. But in his very next release, 'The Wanderer,' you can see how, 
when it's the male who behaves that way, it is considered acceptable. Dion's 
message is that it is cool to have a girl on each arm -- and 'Rosie' tattooed 
on his chest." 
</P>
<P>
Aquila's previous book was "The Iroquois Restoration," a history of American 
Indians, and he said that his methodology for that book was the same as his 
methodology for this one. This time around, though, he is using the Kingston 
Trio's "Scotch and Soda" as an artifact of the nation's attitude toward alcohol 
consumption, and Skeeter Davis' "The End of the World" -- which I always 
thought was just a sad, pretty song -- as an example of "the apocalyptic 
imagery of the Cold War era." 
</P>
<P>
There was one question I had to ask the professor: What about "Bobby's Girl"? 
</P>
<P>
"Marcie Blane sang that song," Aquila said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite aware of that," I said. "I just want to know if it means anything 
historically." 
</P>
<P>
"The lyrics were blatantly sexist," he said. "They relegated the girl's 
existence to a mere appendage of the boy's -- which was a good reflection of 
the times. The girl's only goal is to prove she's 'not a kid anymore.' She is 
implicitly willing to put her career and her life on the back burner. Why? So 
she can achieve the one role that is important to her -- to be 'Bobby's Girl."' 
</P>
<P>
The professor's next book, he said, will be another history of American 
Indians. Presumably Little Peggy March will not be included. Although you never 
know.

ROSE BOWL SWAP MEET TURNS 21 SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Beverly Kiviat started selling silverware patterns at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena 20 years ago, the monthly swap meet was a new bud on the City of 
Roses' calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, says Nancy Kiviat, Beverly's daughter and now a partner in the 
business, the swap meet was a place for people to go "when they needed to clean 
out the garage." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday marks the 21st anniversary of the Rose Bowl Swap Meet, and though you 
can still find plenty of garage-sale bargains, the event has grown to 1,500 
exhibitors, hawking everything from new Levi's and gold jewelry to old Vogue 
patterns and Soviet Olympic coins. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up at the swap meet," says Nancy, who started coming to the meet 
with her mother at the age of 9. "It's different now. There are more business 
people, and for some (the swap meet) is like an extension of their stores." 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Kiviat didn't realize the business potential of the swap meet until 
she liquidated her own business and took the leftovers -- sets of silverware in 
old patterns -- to the Rose Bowl to sell, Nancy says. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't want the complete sets," Nancy says. "They wanted pieces." 
</P>
<P>
So Beverly obliged, and today the Kiviats' pattern-matching service deals in 
hard-to-find patterns from the late 1800s to 1960. Nancy, who has a business 
degree, says she does "better at the Rose Bowl than in any corporate job." 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of foot traffic makes it worthwhile," she says. (Officials estimate 
a 20,000-30,000 average attendance each month.) And the job "gives me freedom. 
I'm out shopping all the time, but I work primarily on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Another Rose Bowl Swap Meet veteran is Stan Milatovic, who specializes in Early 
American furniture. A native of Yugoslavia, he recalls that in the early days 
the swap meet was one of the few places that handled antiques. Now that antique 
stores are in vogue, "it's harder and more competitive than it used to be," 
Milatovic says. But that's good news to buyers, because he claims swap meet 
merchandise "sells a little bit cheaper than in the shops." 
</P>
<P>
And Milatovic, like Kiviat, couldn't fathom trading his plot of cement at the 
Rose Bowl for a shop of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have opened one, but I don't like stores," he says. Holding regular 
hours just doesn't allow the flexibility of his mobile business. And there's a 
camaraderie, Kiviat notes, especially among the veteran dealers and those who 
deal in antiques and collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of good merchandise," Milatovic says. "You can always find a 
bargain, but the sharp collectors get here early. Everything cheap and unusual 
is usually gone early." 
</P>
<P>
Milatovic and his wife, Mary, pack a rented truck almost every weekend for swap 
meets at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena City College and Long Beach. They've been 
selling their antiques for more than 15 years at the Rose Bowl and, according 
to Stan, "we're not ever going to retire."

VALENCIA SHUTS OUT BREA-OLINDA TO EARN A SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE

Valencia High School recorded its third shutout of the season Friday night, 
30-0 over Brea-Olinda, to secure a share of the Orange League title, its 
seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia is tied with Savanna, which defeated Western Friday night, 14-13. 
After a coin flip, Valencia was designated the No. 2 playoff representative. 
Savanna is No. 1, and Western third. 
</P>
<P>
Any playoff hopes for Brea-Olinda, (7-3 overall and 2-3 in league), were 
squelched by the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit for the Valencia's success this season, and against 
Brea-Olinda, was directly related to its defense, which has allowed just 46 
points this season. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, (9-0-1, 4-0-1), forced Brea into turnovers on three first-half 
possessions and held a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Senior running back Sergio Ortiz scored on a three-yard run on the second play 
of the second quarter to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead. Senior defensive back Paul 
Castillo set up the touchdown when he intercepted a pass by Brea-Olinda 
quarterback Chad Marlow at the Tiger 41-yard line and returned it to the three. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Richard Wells connected on a 31-yard scoring play to wide 
receiver David Sanchez with 9:21 remaining in the second quarter to make it 
14-0. That followed another Brea-Olinda turnover. Ryan Nicholson fumbled after 
a 25-yard pass reception, and Ryan Roskelly recovered for Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers sealed the victory early in the fourth quarter when junior Mike Ehli 
recovered Ortiz's fumble in the end zone to make it 24-0. DENNIS KAISER

Solid defense in the second half was the key for Anaheim High School in its 
32-8 victory over Magnolia in an Orange League football game at Western High 
School Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Magnolia at halftime, 15-8, Anaheim's Walter Flores recovered Pat 
McNeil's fumble on the first play of the second half at the Magnolia 29. Five 
plays later, Tony Olivo scored on a 10-yard pass from freshman quarterback Phil 
Covarrubis . 
</P>
<P>
Four plays following the ensuing kick, Anaheim got the ball back on downs and 
Joe Macklin scored from the one to make the score, 29-8, with 5:14 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Covarrubis, playing in his first varsity game, scored Anaheim's first touchdown 
on a one-yard run with 1:22 left in the first quarter. He also completed eight 
of 12 passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns.

Southern Section playoff berth with a 14-10 victory over University High School 
(2-8, 0-5) Friday night.

The Tillers scored first when quarterback Andy Borza hit Chad Smith with a

Then Ancich broke loose for a 66-yard run that set up a Borza one-yard 
touchdown run, giving the Tillers a 14-7 edge, but the Trojans answered with a 
22-yard David Jacobson field goal to make it 14-10 just before the half. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin could not relax until University failed to score on a fourth and goal on 
the Tiller seven with 2:30 left. The Tillers stopped Jerry Apana at the three 
on a short pass, denying the Trojans their first league victory of the year.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: SANTA ANA'S EECO REPORTS $4.1 MILLION FOR 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EECO Inc., a Santa Ana-based manufacturer, reported net income of $4.1 million 
for the third quarter ended Oct. 1, contrasted with net income of $255,000 for 
the like period a year ago. The 1989 quarter includes a gain of $6.8 million 
from the previously reported sale of its Avionics business. Sales dropped 34%, 
to $10.5 million from $15.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company lost $612,000 for the first three quarters of the year, contrasted 
with net income of $286,000 in 1988. Year-to-date sales for 1989 declined 19%, 
to $37.9 million from $46.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
EECO attributed the lower sales levels in 1989 to price erosion in the keyboard 
business and a decline in volume in all its businesses due to the inability to 
meet customer demand. That was caused by disruptions resulting from facility 
moves and inadequate material planning and control, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
EECO manufactures computer keyboards, electronic key pads, electromechanical 
switches and hotel computer systems worldwide.

Mozart's "The Magic Flute" is an imperishable masterpiece by any lights, but 
how many of us have sat through interminably draggy, supremely unmagical 
performances by major opera companies and gone home feeling it would be just 
fine never to see it again? 
</P>
<P>
Surprise! The antidote to those secret "I-hate-the-'Flute' " blues is being 
produced right now at UC Irvine. This joint effort of the music, drama and 
dance departments opened Thursday night in Fine Arts Village Theater on the UCI 
campus and proved conclusively that you don't need a huge budget or great 
voices to capture splendidly the essence of this 
spiritual-comic-serious-fantastic opera. 
</P>
<P>
Stage director Robert Cohen, designers Douglas Scott-Goheen, Elizabeth Novak 
and Liz Stillwell, choreographer Janice Gudde Plastino and conductor Zelman 
Bokser see to it that all aspects of the work -- musical, scenic and dramatic 
-- are given proper weight. 
</P>
<P>
Stunning, always apt, never inept effects abound. The chorus doesn't clomp on 
and off in formation; panels on either side of the stage open from floor to 
ceiling to reveal the gold-robed figures in boxes stacked one on top of 
another, three stories high. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen of the Night rises from the earth to a height of 20 feet in a 
metallic blue gown strung with penlights, while Sarastro enters in a chariot, 
drawn by dancing "lions." The three beguiling Knaben fly in on a giant Masonic 
eye, later a crocodile, the three Ladies are blue, green and purple, and so it 
goes, imaginatively and wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatically, amalgamating the Speaker, 2nd Priest and 2nd Guard into one "High 
Priest" lends special continuity to Tamino's scenes with those governing his 
initiation rites. Monostatos, less gross caricature than usual, actually has 
moments that evoke empathy, and at opera's end, the Queen is forgiven by 
Sarastro -- and it works. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some sing much better than others, but every cast member performs 
well in the occasionally awkward translation by Robert and Lorna Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Most adept are Donald Christensen (Papageno), Steve Dunham (Tamino), Laurel 
Boyd (Pamina) and Kerry O'Brien (Queen). The UCI Symphony provides scrappy 
moments and great spirit under Bokser's sometimes hasty direction. Counting 
tonight, seven opportunities remain not to miss this charming production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Magic Flute" continues through Nov. 18 in the Fine Arts Village Theater, 
UC Irvine, Campus Drive and Bridge Street, Irvine. Performances Saturday and 
Tuesday through Nov. 18 at 8 p.m. Matinee at 2 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $11 to 
$15. Information: (714) 856-5000.

SERRANO'S PHOTOGRAPHS LACK PUNCH;

EXHIBIT: THOUGH A REPRODUCTION OF ONE OF HIS WORKS WAS REMOVED FROM THE POSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, when Sen. Jesse Helms was on the warpath against federal funding 
for controversial art exhibits, the lawmaker thundered from the Capitol that 
male genitalia "will not be exposed at the taxpayers' expense!" 
</P>
<P>
In that instance, the National Endowment for the Arts came under fire for 
underwriting exhibits that included a photo by Andres Serrano of a crucifix 
submerged in urine and homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, another Serrano and another set of photographs became 
the focus of a halfhearted attempt at censorship at Cypress College. A 
reproduction of one of Rafael Serrano's photographs was removed from a poster 
advertising the college's exhibit, "Frailty of Power: Three Views," because of 
fears of confronting the public's distaste for male nudity. 
</P>
<P>
But the work by Rafael Serrano (no relation to Andres) remains at the gallery 
through Nov. 16, along with Charlene Knowlton's mixed-media photographs -- 
which involve male and female nudity -- and photographs by Sheila Pinkel. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the two women's photographs actually pack more of a punch than 
Serrano's. In fact, it's hard to see what the phallic fuss at Cypress College 
is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano's photos of eccentric, barren landscape tableaux are created with such 
odds and ends as toy airplanes and ships, tree branches, furniture -- and 
carved phallic symbols, which can be found lying about or serving as 
architectural columns. Garishly lighted to create the effect of orange sunsets 
or pale dawn skies, the pieces are meditations on the destructive power of 
militarism, portrayed as a specifically male phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
In "Panorama/night" and "Panorama/day," the curving, red-veined "columns" that 
balance a splintered piece of wood with nails punched through it are 
unmistakably stylized renderings of the male organ. Displayed in this 
serpentine fashion, divorced from its bodily context, it seems as unlikely to 
offend delicate sensibilities as, say, a goosenecked lamp. 
</P>
<P>
More important, however, the image doesn't come across as an especially 
powerful anti-militaristic statement. Maybe the point is that the penises are 
supposed to look silly -- that there is no real manliness in violent activity. 
But the only signs of "violence" here are nails poking through hacked-up wood 
-- not exactly a riveting symbol in this age of overkill. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano creates a clearerimage in "Rio de Sangre," with a red sea, a beached 
ship and an object that looks like a broken phallus lying on the river bank. A 
trinity of symbols of slaughter, defeat and maleness work in close conspiracy. 
Again, the mighty penis is humbled -- though, again, in a way that has nothing 
to do with the erotic lure that the Mrs. Grundys of the world are so anxious to 
protect us against. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkel's "Goethe Garden No. 4" is a quietly provocative installation -- 
provocative in terms of its ideas, that is, not because of anything to do with 
sexual imagery. The viewer sees a row of silver-painted feathers and dried 
branches lined up against the wall. On the floor, letters spell out a quote 
from the German 19th-Century poet: "Everything that lives strives for color." 
</P>
<P>
Looking through a device set up several feet from the lineup of natural 
imagery, the viewer sees it in bright blue and yellow. Although one could wish 
for a more lifelike color transformation, the switch from the "dead" quality of 
silver to color gives the ecological message a startling immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
Other works by Pinkel are photo-Xeroxes that seek to engage the mind in 
socially activist lines of thought. A fanciful untitled work shows the natural 
world as it might appear from a vantage point under the earth: a medley of sea 
horses, dried grasses, bugs' undersides and human feet. 
</P>
<P>
In "Realize," the huge image of the face of an American Indian with closed 
(blind?) eyes is partitioned by crisp grid marks -- a frequent device of 
Pinkel's, which keeps the viewer from being lulled into complacency by the 
"fictional" world of art. Underneath the image are the words "Real Eyes," 
"Realize" and "Real Lies," suggesting that the truth of common "knowledge" 
about the American Indian experience is deeply suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Using paint and wax, Knowlton daubs, feathers and masks huge photographs of 
nudes with the regalia of tribal warriors. Attached pieces of wood or copper 
also carry painted designs suggestive of magic and ritual. Part artifacts, part 
recording documents, these works have a satisfyingly dense, atmospheric 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
In Knowlton's "You Don't Need a Weatherman," the dangling arm of a (dead?) 
masked figure forms the lower angle of a kite-shaped photograph with a "tail" 
made of bundled wires that pull apart into a fuzz of broken connections. The 
title phrase recalls Bob Dylan's political observation (apropos of members of a 
radical group of the '60s), "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the 
wind blows," and the piece seems to be an elegy for the passing of Stone Age 
cultures and the severing of ties between elemental values and contemporary 
society. 
</P>
<P>
"Frailty of Power: Three Views" remains through Friday at Cypress College, 9200 
Valley View St., Cypress. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through 
Friday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 826-4511 or 826-2220.

HARD-WORKING HEAVY METAL FAN SPEAKS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From time to time the newspapers run articles about organizations that are 
trying to ban heavy metal music because they feel it is a bad influence on 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
I am a hard-working student at Dana Hills High School who strives to get good 
grades. I also listen to heavy metal music. My parents had trouble adjusting to 
my interest in heavy metal, but I pointed out to them that I do, indeed, get 
good grades and that I was aware of their concerns. I made a deal with them 
that if I started doing poorly in school, then they could take my tapes from 
me. 
</P>
<P>
I am very lucky to have the parents I have. Many won't even give the music a 
chance, much less their children, and others form activist groups that focus on 
the negative side of heavy metal rather than looking at the positive. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that these parents don't remember that our ancestors fought a 
revolution to win the rights we have today. One of these is the freedom of 
speech -- and music is a form of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, some heavy metal bands do cause problems and are nothing but 
trouble. But there are a lot of other metal groups that do not. Many parents 
mistakenly feel that rock bands with long-haired singers and loud voices are 
bad, but they should take the time to listen to the music and see for 
themselves that it is not.

TWA earnings -- An item in Friday's earnings column incorrectly stated the 
third-quarter results of Trans World Airlines. The airline company reported a 
net loss of $29.9 million, contrasted with a profit of $88 million in the same 
period a year ago. Revenue was unchanged at $1.3 billion. The New York-based 
firm cited increased interest expenses and a non-recurring gain from litigation 
in the 1988 period.

O.C. GERMAN COMMUNITY CELEBRATES FALL OF THE WALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Wolfgang and Trudy Wirthgen woke up at 6 a.m. Friday and flipped on the 
television to face an unbelievable image: an East German man taking a pickax to 
the Berlin Wall without being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"We both started to cry," said Wolfgang Wirthgen, who left East Germany 30 
years ago with his wife and now lives in Corona. "Not in my wildest dreams 
could I ever imagine this." 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County's tight-knit German community, Friday was a day of 
celebration, a day to marvel at the amazing events that appear to have 
transformed their native country into a land of hope and joy. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the local festivities is the Phoenix Club, the Anaheim social 
group that is the largest German-American organization in Southern California. 
At the club's regular bimonthly meeting Friday night, more than 300 members 
gathered to toast this historic week. 
</P>
<P>
As the celebration unfolded, Gunter and Segrid Kunkel, tall, fair and looking 
much younger than their 50-odd years, stood in the back of the room and smiled 
as German beer flowed and free bottles of California champagne were placed on 
every table. A banner on one wall read: Die Mauer ist gebrochen! 
</P>
<P>
"The Wall is broken," Gunther Kunkel, 55, translated proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Kunkel, a past president of the Phoenix Club who arrived in New York from the 
Saar Valley in West Germany 33 years ago, explained the significance of the 
club's name, taken from the mythological Egyptian bird "that rose from the 
ashes" to demonstrate its immortality. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany has risen in a sense from the ashes of World War II. I think East 
Germany is lagging 40 years behind West Germany, but I think their time is 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
The opening of East Berlin, Kunkel said, "is something that we never would have 
dreamed possible even only a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the ceremonies and speeches were conducted in German, but officials 
were happy to translate for the dozen television and newspaper reporters who 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that our American friends take such an interest in our 
freedom," said current club president Hans Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Klein had marveled at the good news from Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in a dream world," Klein said. "It's unbelievable the feeling you 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls poured into the Phoenix Club on Friday from members and 
non-members alike eager to offer felicitations and discuss the latest 
developments in Eastern Europe, said Barbara Mann, the club's bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Mann lived in Berlin when the wall was built in 1961, and remembers the horror 
of seeing the city gradually divided by the barrier of cement blocks. On 
Thursday, she called friends in Berlin and told them to save her a piece of the 
wall. To her brother, she sent a telegram asking when he could visit her from 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I want to go back right now," she said. "I want to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The greetings even came in by facsimile machine. "The wall has been broken," 
read one message received by Klein. "Freedom, unity and peace." 
</P>
<P>
The figurative end of the wall also provoked unpleasant memories about what led 
many Germans to leave their homeland, knowing they might never see family 
members again. 
</P>
<P>
The wall itself was enough "to give you goose bumps," said Trudy Wirthgen. 
"They walk big dogs. There's a watchtower with soldiers who have machine guns. 
They treat you like dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Wirthgen recalled that one of the few acceptable reasons to leave East 
Germany was old age. Women older than 62 and men older than 65 were permitted 
to leave the country "after they weren't useful to the government anymore," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before relatives could secure permission to visit the United States, the East 
German government required the Wirthgens to send a statement from local police 
certifying that the couple lived in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
"They laughed themselves silly," he said of police officials. 
</P>
<P>
Klein told of a nephew, a cook at a local country club frequented by government 
officials, who was afraid to speak to Westerners on the telephone for fear that 
he would lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the Phoenix Club will be paying for five German families to travel 
to Anaheim to see if they would like to move to this country. The Phoenix Club, 
which has a membership of 3,500 families, will offer help with finding jobs and 
housing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have earned it. They have voted with their feet," Klein said. "Even the 
toughest regime can't resist when people want something different."

BUSH PROPOSES $6.8-BILLION HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Friday unveiled a $6.8-billion housing proposal built around 
government grants, tax credits -- and a proposal made a year ago by Michael S. 
Dukakis. The plan is intended to help low-income families buy homes, to ease 
the way for first-time home-buyers to make down payments and to provide support 
for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In his first major presidential speech on the nation's housing crisis, Bush 
said that the program addresses "the full range of housing concerns: from 
shelter for the homeless to affordable housing for low-income families, to 
initiatives that open access to expanded job opportunities and help millions 
more Americans own their own homes." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which Bush presented in broad outline to the annual meeting here 
of the National Assn. of Realtors, reflects renewed interest within the 
government in the nation's housing crisis after the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's redirection of federal funds away from housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, a key element of the plan -- making permanent a now-temporary program 
granting tax credits to encourage rehabilitation of rental housing -- is 
threatened because Bush would attach it to his controversial and so-far 
unsuccessful effort to lower the capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
The credits would cost the federal treasury $2.6 billion in lost revenue, Jack 
Kemp, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, told 
reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Under another element in the President's plan, up to $10,000 could be withdrawn 
from an individual retirement account to use as a down payment. The purchase 
price of the house could be no more than 110% of the average home price in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"You all know about families working to buy that first home. Well, they deserve 
our help, and they're going to get it," Bush said. "I will ask Congress to 
enact legislation allowing first-time buyers to draw, without penalty, on IRA 
savings as a down payment for that first home." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has become one of the nation's most impenetrable markets for 
first-time home buyers. Home prices are among the highest in the nation, 
hitting a median $260,000 in October, according to one survey. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA proposal is a near copy of one advanced a year ago by Dukakis, the 
Massachusetts governor, who ran against Bush last year. On Oct. 10, 1988, the 
Democratic presidential candidate announced his housing proposals, saying that 
"Mr. Bush has no housing program. He has no solutions. He has no new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan Dukakis unveiled that day, the government would have permitted 
money to be withdrawn from IRA and 401(k) retirement funds without penalty, if 
the funds were used for first home purchases, and down-payment requirements for 
federally insured mortgages would have been lowered. The $10,000-limit that 
Bush would impose also was included in the original Dukakis plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, money in the IRA and private pension programs known as 
401(k) plans cannot be withdrawn before the saver reaches the age of 59 1/2 
except in cases of specific hardships or if a sharp penalty is paid. Taxes on 
the earnings are deferred until the principal and interest are withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Meyer, managing partner at accountants Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.'s 
Newport Beach office, said the IRA proposal should enable more people to buy a 
house, even in ultra-expensive Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll make a difference in condominiums under $200,000, for instance," he 
said. "With a 5% down payment, that's your $10,000 right there." 
</P>
<P>
The government grant program -- which would total $2.15 billion in federal 
money over three years, if it is approved by Congress -- is intended to help 
low-income families purchase homes. The money would be used by states and 
nonprofit organizations to rehabilitate and purchase housing but not for 
new-home construction. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be aimed at reconstructing public housing, vacant buildings and 
foreclosed properties held by the government, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that these housing units are vacant or have been foreclosed "sends a 
message about how attractive they are," according to Ray Struyk, a senior 
research associate at the Urban Institute, a private, Washington research 
organization specializing in social issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddling the poor with units in such poor shape and poor location -- they are 
doomed in the first place," he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Struyk, who studies housing issues for the Urban Institute, said that the IRA 
proposal has been considered by various groups for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some sentiment it won't make much difference," he said. "It doesn't 
hurt, but it's not clear it will push a lot of people over the margin into home 
ownership." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the debate over the practicality of the IRA proposal is whether 
those who are scraping to make down payments on houses are likely to have been 
able to put money into the retirement savings accounts from which they would 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush program also includes: 
</P>
<P>
Housing vouchers, intended to help eligible low-income families meet the costs 
of escaping public housing projects for more preferable housing in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
A commission, to be appointed by Kemp, to study government regulations and red 
tape "that add unnecessarily to the cost of housing," and, Bush said, to 
recommend how such barriers to affordable housing can be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of the capital gains tax in 50 inner-city "enterprise zones" around 
the country, to encourage business investment in the poorest neighborhoods. The 
capital gains tax is paid on the earnings produced by stocks and other 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
A program, funded by $728 million in federal money and matched by states, local 
communities and nonprofit organizations, to pay for mental health and other 
services supporting the homeless, in addition to the provision of shelter. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 1,000 people are homeless on any given day, according to a 
RAND Corp. estimate, and over the course of a year about 4,000 will be without 
a place to sleep. As elsewhere, the county's shelters are crowded and 
overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
"The real answer for the homeless -- those with mental problems or dependent on 
drugs or alcohol -- is shelter plus care," Bush said.

UCLA WILL TAKE HEART PATIENT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: MOVING HECTOR BOJADO TO THE CENTER IN LOS ANGELES COULD QUALIFY HIM 
FOR MEDI-CAL.

<P>
A specialist at UCI Medical Center has decided to move Hector Bojado, an 
indigent in need of expensive heart-transplant surgery, to the UCLA Medical 
Center for the procedure, a UCI spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Dr. Richard Ott, UCI Medical Center's director of cardiac 
transplantation, would allow Bojado, a 29-year-old Anaheim plastics molder, to 
apply for Medi-Cal insurance at the UCLA center, which is a Medi-Cal-approved 
facility, according to Elaine Beno, a spokeswoman for the medical center here. 
</P>
<P>
Beno said the decision was made after a long consultation Friday afternoon 
between Ott and Bojado. They weighed Bojado's options, including an offer 
Friday by Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach to perform the needed 
transplant operation. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoag's offer was rejected in favor of taking Bojado to the UCLA center in 
Westwood, where attending physicians such as Ott can collaborate on Bojado's 
current and follow-up care, Beno said, reading from a prepared statement by 
Ott. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA has agreed to evaluate Hector," Ott said in the statement. "Mr. Bojado 
joined us in reviewing his medical options and has secured an appointment with 
UCLA's cardiac transplant evaluation service." 
</P>
<P>
Bojado suffers from cardiomyopathy, a persistent virus that attacks the heart, 
causing an irreversible swelling that has left him with little chance of 
surviving unless he receives another heart. A native of Colima, Mexico, Bojado 
has no nearby family. He had been employed as a plastics molder but had worked 
for only two months at his last job and consequently did not qualify for health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
For Medi-Cal to cover the costs of a heart-transplant operation, the surgery 
must be done at a hospital where at least 12 previous transplants have been 
performed, with a 70% success rate a year later. Bojado would have been UCI 
Medical Center's eighth heart-transplant recipient. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Medical Center, which was the first hospital in Los Angeles to perform a 
heart transplant in 1984, has completed more than 100, according to Richard 
Elbaum, spokesman for the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Friday night, Elbaum said he had not heard about Bojado's scheduled 
appointment or when it might occur. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, when a patient is referred to UCLA, he or she receives a diagnostic 
evaluation to determine if the patient is a good candidate medically, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The process can take several days and also requires meetings with a hospital 
committee, which ultimately will decide whether to put Bojado on the list. If 
his situation is deemed critical, Elbaum said, that evaluation process is 
condensed. 
</P>
<P>
Elbaum was not sure whether Medi-Cal's formula would pay 100% of the costs of 
the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Once Bojado becomes a candidate for the surgery, he is put on a priority 
transplant list with the Regional Organ Procurement Agency based at UCLA. There 
now are 22 patients on the list, and 19 more on a similar list at the Southern 
California Organ Procurement and Preservation Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, doctors sought to have the transplant procedure done at UCI Medical 
Center, but its high cost, which could range from $70,000 to $150,000, was an 
obstacle. And medical center officials decided that they could not absorb the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center's Auxiliary, the center's fund-raising arm, had mounted a 
campaign to raise an $80,000 deposit required of patients such as Bojado, who 
have no medical insurance, to be put on the center's heart-transplant list. 
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary was able to raise nearly $50,000, and its members then tried to 
persuade hospital administrators to reduce the required deposit to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
When that proposal was rejected, auxiliary spokesman Jim Curran, acting as a 
private citizen, contacted Hoag officials to see whether they would take Bojado 
as a patient. 
</P>
<P>
A frustrated John Stroh, the medical center's auxiliary president, had 
commented that Bojado's condition could worsen, adding, "and in the meantime 
we're playing this political football." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Hoag administrators responded to the appeal, agreeing to admit 
Bojado for a heart transplant. But it ultimately was decided to send him to 
UCLA, Beno said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ott and Mary Piccione, the UCI center's executive director, said Friday 
that they were grateful for Hoag's offer, as well as for the support of Orange 
County residents who donated about $48,000 to the auxiliary for Bojado. 
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary has been desperately trying to raise money so that Bojado could 
be considered for the operation. Originally, the organization was scrambling 
for money for two people, Bojado and Stephen Regalado, 23, of Mission Viejo, 
who also had no medical insurance. But Regalado died without ever making a 
transplant-waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
Contributors who pledged funds, some of which had been earmarked for Regalado 
or Bojado, will be given their choice of leaving their donation in a trust for 
Bojado for follow-up care, transferring it to the general Patient Emergency 
Trust Fund, or having their donation returned, Beno said.

SUPERVISORS TO MEET WITH S.D. COLLEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors will hold its first-ever joint meeting 
with the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Nov. 28 to discuss jails, 
transportation, waste management and other regional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the two boards have met formally that I know of," 
said John Sibley of the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said the board would hold its regularly scheduled meeting in Santa Ana, 
then board a van for the trip to San Diego. The joint meeting is scheduled to 
begin at 1 p.m. at the County Administration Building in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of the topics to be discussed during the meeting will be San Diego's 
possible participation in a proposed regional jail to be built in eastern 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was unveiled Wednesday by Supervisor Don R. Roth. Next week, he is 
expected to seek fellow board members' approval of a feasibility study of the 
regional jail plan and creation of a Southern California Regional Jail 
Authority to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said a regional jail could serve Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San 
Diego counties. Los Angeles has never been "contemplated" as part of the 
program, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no official letter will be presented during the meeting in San Diego, 
Roth said he will make it clear that he wants San Diego County to participate 
in the jail plan. 
</P>
<P>
A regional jail could eliminate the need for a planned county jail in Gypsum 
Canyon, east of Anaheim Hills, that is opposed by Roth. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, who will be mounting a campaign 
for a proposed half-cent sales tax for jail and court construction, has said 
the county's jail overcrowding problem would not be solved by "moving it to 
someone else's back yard."

In its role as the city redevelopment agency members, the City Council approved 
an owner-participation agreement with Hopkins Development Co. for a project 
that will result in the demolition of existing buildings and the construction 
of new stores on the west side of the mall. The shopping center is at the 
corner of Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lee Risner said final plans for the project will be presented at a 
December meeting. Mayor William D. Mahoney spoke for the project, saying that 
"it has been a long time in coming. I know that Hopkins and the city manager's 
office have worked hard together to make this happen. I think it's definitely 
going to benefit the community." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey B. Armour, Hopkins' development manager and partner, explained that 
demolition of a large portion of the existing mall, including Buffum's 
Department Store, is scheduled to begin in March. Construction of new 
facilities, including four major stores, should start in April. A grand opening 
is tentatively slated for Nov. 15, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Risner said businesses scheduled for replacement by the new project generate 
about $15 million in retail sales each year. He projects that the new stores 
will generate about $53 million in their second year of operation. The 
Bullock's store is expected to remain and Risner predicts that it will enjoy a 
10% increase in business as a result of proposed improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Sales and property tax revenues will be used to repay a bond issue providing 
Hopkins with $2.5 million to help with the $32-million project. The debt will 
be repaid over 30 years, according to Armour. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Square was developed by Bullock's in 1968. Armour explained that the 
development of other malls, including those in Brea and Puente Hills, resulted 
in a decline in sales for Fashion Square businesses. DAVID BURKE

PARK IS NAMED FOR LATE JEAN WOODARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Name the Park contest conducted by the Department of Parks and Recreation 
resulted in the naming of a lot on Granby Street north of Avenue Adobe in honor 
of Jean Woodard, who was active in community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously approved the name Jean Woodard Park after several 
of Woodard's friends appeared on her behalf at the council meeting earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard, who died of lung cancer in 1984, was one of the founders of the Yorba 
Linda YMCA and a member of the Yorba Linda Service League, as well as serving 
twice as chairwoman of the city's Fiesta Days Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Woodard entered his mother's name in the contest, which invited any 
interested individuals to suggest names for six new and proposed parks. 
</P>
<P>
"She did a lot and never was one to brag about all she was doing," he said. "I 
think it would be appropriate to name an area whose purpose is relaxation, fun 
and happiness after someone who gave so much time and energy to see that others 
were having fun and being happy." 
</P>
<P>
The council has not yet adopted names for the remaining five parks.

AIRPORT GROUP ASKS FOR $5,200 DONATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council appears lukewarm over a funding request by an ad-hoc 
organization that has come under fire from South Orange County officials and 
landowners for considering the area as a possible site for a second regional 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence J. Turner, vice president of the Costa Mesa-based Airport Site 
Coalition, said he has asked Mission Viejo officials to donate $5,200 to the 
organization, which is experiencing fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The funding request will be considered at the council's Monday night meeting, 
Mayor William S. Craycraft said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Craycraft, who has repeatedly criticized the coalition for various 
proposals to build a regional airport in South County, said that he will 
recommend rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"If the coalition is bent on recommending a South Orange County site, I would 
strongly oppose that our city participate in funding the coalition," Craycraft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Airport Site Coalition began 19 months ago to narrow a list of 31 proposed 
airport sites. A second airport site is being sought as a way to relieve 
traffic problems and airplane congestion at John Wayne Airport, Turner said.

OLD HOTEL: A DUMP OR LANDMARK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away on Seaview Avenue in Corona del Mar is a pink, three-story building 
covered with pink bougainvillea and surrounded by a chain-link fence and 
no-trespassing signs. Palm trees stand guard by the padlocked door, and green 
awnings hang from broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach City Council last week took a final step toward destruction 
of the building at 2500 Seaview Ave. when it approved plans for six 
condominiums on the site. Demolition is scheduled to start soon, according to 
David Dien, spokesman for Carnation Cove in Newport Beach, owner of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Good riddance, some residents say of the structure that they describe as a 
flophouse firetrap. But at least a few mourn the loss of what once was the 
grand old Hotel Del Mar, Corona del Mar's oldest building. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's disgusting and sad to see it torn down for progress," said 
resident Suzanne Volski, a real estate consultant. "There has to be some time 
when we say stop." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mang, manager of an apartment complex next door to the old hotel, a complex 
that also is scheduled to give way to condominiums, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see it go," he said. "Condos are condos -- this is tradition." 
</P>
<P>
But the structure's more recent checkered past is one that resident Joe Collins 
would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they're getting rid of that piece of junk," said Collins, a general 
contractor who lives across the street. "For years now, it's been a collection 
of ladies of the night, dope dealers and everything else you can think of." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it was a real dump," said Councilman Phil Sansone. "I haven't heard 
any sentiment other than, 'Let's get that thing out of there.' It was a 
nuisance in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But others say that the residents simply tired of the fight to save it. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought like hell to save that place and so did a lot of others," said 
Barbara Humphreys, a Realtor who owned the building 10 years ago and tried to 
restore it. The city, however, refused to give her permission to operate a bed 
and breakfast inn there. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got tired of the controversy," she said. "It broke my heart." 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Del Mar was built in 1907 by town founder George Hart to attract 
people to the isolated seaside town that he was unsuccessfully trying to 
promote, according to Dr. William Hendricks, director of Sherman Library in 
Corona del Mar for 25 years. LESLIE HERZOG

NEIGHBORS BATTLE FIRES WITH HOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors armed with garden hoses battled to keep one house fire from spreading 
to another on their Newport Beach street Thursday night until firefighters 
could arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"They really kept the flames from hitting my house," said Olive Kirkpatrick, 
60, referring to her neighbors, who helped to save her house in the 200 block 
of Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick said the fire began in a house next to hers about 8:30 p.m. while 
she and her husband were reading newspapers. "We heard a constant popping," she 
said. "When we ran outside, the upstairs of the neighbor's house was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick and her neighbors used four garden hoses to wet the side of her 
house before 29 firefighters from Newport Beach, Costa Mesa and Huntington 
Beach arrived. The firefighters took about 10 minutes to contain the blaze in 
neighbor Richard Sullivan's house, which was burning too much for the garden 
hoses to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department spokeswoman Bonny Hanson said the fire caused $30,000 damage to 
Sullivan's house. Sullivan was not home when the blaze started. Hanson said the 
cause of the fire, which started in an upstairs office, is still being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The Kirkpatricks' house, which is about six feet from the Sullivan residence, 
suffered burned eaves and broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really lucky," said Kirkpatrick, adding that the roof of her house was 
destroyed three years ago in another fire. "I kept wondering whether it would 
happen again. The firemen said if they got there a minute later, our house 
would have caught fire."

PASSENGER KILLED IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Rossmoor boy died early Friday shortly after the motorcycle he 
was a passenger on went out of control and crashed, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
James Englehaupt died at 1:10 a.m. at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, about two 
hours after the accident along St. Albans Drive in Rossmoor, said CHP spokesman 
Lyle Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
Englehaupt was a passenger on the off-road motorcycle driven by Michael David 
Winter, 18, also of Rossmoor. Whitten said the pair were headed east on St. 
Albans Drive near Silver Fox Road at an unknown speed when Winter apparently 
lost control of the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
They crashed into a curb and struck a post, throwing them from the motorcycle. 
Englehaupt suffered massive head and internal injuries while Winter, who was 
taken to the same hospital, had a broken arm and other minor injuries. Whitten 
said neither youth was wearing a helmet.

BILINGUAL TEACHERS CRUCIAL TO LA HABRA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT

LA HABRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 students in La Habra City School District are classified as 
"limited English proficient," according to a recent language survey. Spanish is 
the primary language for 94% of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district operates 36 bilingual or ESL (English as a Second 
Language) classrooms, only 10 of the teachers are certified as bilingual 
teachers. The district plans to help teachers by offering training leading to 
full certification, Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the certificates, teachers must pass tests in culture, 
methodology and Spanish language. Fehr said several teachers have completed all 
but the language portion, which she described as very demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably have as many fully certificated teachers, proportionately, as most 
districts in the county," Fehr said. Recruitment of bilingual teachers is 
difficult, she said, adding that the district is now searching for a bilingual 
kindergarten teacher.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY TOPS NO. 1 EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If memories linger, Capistrano Valley High School's 22-21 victory over El Toro 
Friday certainly was a haunting flashback. 
</P>
<P>
If you care to go back in time, it was the same score by which Capistrano 
Valley defeated El Toro two years ago and then forfeited when Capistrano Valley 
was charged in a well chronicled spying incident. 
</P>
<P>
The game of the year turned into a blast from the past as the county's two best 
teams played for the South Coast League championship and the No. 1 ranking in 
Orange County before 6,000 at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By the time El Toro's Ken Romaniszyn missed a 35-yard field goal attempt with 
16 seconds remaining, most of the fans and players were pointing to the 
scoreboard that looked strikingly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that score remind you of anything," asked Damon Psaros, Capistrano Valley 
nose guard. "It couldn't be any sweeter, 22-21. How sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeter still, the victory gave Capistrano Valley (10-0, 5-0) its first 
undefeated season in the school's 12-year history and the top seeding in the 
Division III playoffs that will be announced Sunday at the Southern Section 
office in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (9-1, 4-1) will have to settle for second and likely the second 
seeding. El Toro had problems putting its right foot forward, missing four 
field goal attempts and an extra-point attempt as Brad Hulse and Romaniszyn 
failed to connect. 
</P>
<P>
"The kicking game was the difference," said Eric Patton, Capistrano Valley 
coach. "This was one of the greatest victories in the history of the school. 
One of the most exciting games I've been associated with." 
</P>
<P>
Hulse missed on field goal attempts of 45, 31 and 30 yards before El Toro Coach 
Bob Johnson called for Romaniszyn with the game on the line and El Toro 
trailing, 22-21. 
</P>
<P>
Romaniszyn attempted a 35-yard field goal following an interception by teammate 
Brian Haas, but his kick was short and Capistrano Valley had the league title 
and the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guy had missed a few, so I decided to try Romaniszyn," Johnson said. 
"He missed, but give Capistrano Valley the credit. They beat us and they 
deserved to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought when Haas intercepted the pass, we had another chance to pull out 
the win. But we got killed all night by flags. We had a touchdown called back 
and two other potential scores killed by three chop blocks (blocking below the 
waist). We haven't had that called all year." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro dominated the line of scrimmage and tailback Jerome Oakman gained 141 
yards in 20 carries. Oakman's performance was nearly matched by Capistrano 
Valley back Paul Shaheen, who gained 121 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley played most of the game without Psaros, its best defensive 
player. Psaros was ejected with 9:06 remaining in the first half for allegedly 
swinging at an opponent. El Toro continually ran plays up the middle with 
Psaros missing at nose guard, taking a 14-6 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter was wild, with the teams scoring three times in a 
three-minute period. Capistrano Valley tied the score, 14-14, when Shaheen 
scored on a 75-yard run, but El Toro roared right back. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro quarterback Steve Stenstrom connected with Kevin Rowe on a 66-yard 
touchdown pass on the first play after the kickoff to give the Chargers a 21-14 
lead. But Capistrano Valley wasn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Chris Adams, who has missed most of the season with lower back 
problems, scored on a two-yard run and then added a two-point conversion run 
that ultimately was the difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Patton tried his best to downplay the past, but the numbers said 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are all wrong to bring up the past," Patton said. "That's history. 
We're living right now. I'm sure a couple of kids remember it, but we don't 
talk about it. It's in the past."

FUN AGAIN IN SANTA BARBARA; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: REJUVENTATED PROGRAM WINS WITHOUT BIG-TIME TRAPPINGS; NOW 
GAUCHOS WANT TO MOVE UP TO DIVISION II. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GOLETA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sun is shining, the skies are clear and nearly 100 merry funsters from the 
University of California at Santa Barbara are committing wholesale mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Is this fun or what? 
</P>
<P>
It is college football, but there are no scholarships here, no deep-pocket 
boosters, just the game played for the joy of competition and the incomparable 
delight of joining with other fine young men to decimate, degrade and destroy 
an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
What else could a kid ask for? Division II status? 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara's rejuvenated football program -- the deluxe Division III 
model -- is in its fourth year after a 15-year hiatus and things couldn't be 
better. The team is 7-2, has won six in a row and seemingly every able-bodied 
male on campus wants to be a part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have 140 players but we only have 100 helmets," said John Kasser, 
UCSB's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who did latch on to head gear are from Southern California, eight 
from Orange County. Most were good high school players and exceptional students 
who were attracted by UCSB's academic reputation, not to mention the 
Brigadoon-like surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this place, it's perfect," said receiver Brain Fleming, formerly of 
Laguna Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
But the fine times at UCSB are definitely not shared by their opponents. On 
this particularly fine Saturday afternoon, the opponents are 30 or so members 
of the Menlo College football team. 
</P>
<P>
The Menlo Oaks made the mistake of saying some less than complimentary things 
about the Gauchos, their coaching staff and their girlfriends before the game. 
As the game unfolds, however, it becomes apparent that the Oaks' bark is much 
worse than their bite. 
</P>
<P>
They are bashed throughout, the big hits rattling through the 16,300 empty 
seats of UCSB's Harder Stadium (capacity 17,000) and causing even the most 
ardent UCSB fan to emit a sympathetic groan. 
</P>
<P>
The final score will be 59-0, a wipeout but nothing the hometown folks haven't 
become accustomed to when UCSB plays another Division III opponent. The week 
before it beat the University of San Diego, 51-3. 
</P>
<P>
Menlo and San Diego are the only Division III opponents Santa Barbara plays 
this year, actually they were the only teams that would schedule Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Division III teams just won't play us," Kasser said. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder? UCSB has a .705 winning percentage against Division II teams 
over the past four seasons. Santa Barbara is a big school (enrollment: 18,500), 
with a big, Division I athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball team has been a Big West contender ever since Jerry Pimm showed 
up to coach in 1983. The water polo team is a perennial power that won a 
national championship in 1979. The men's volleyball team made it to the NCAA 
final in 1987 and the women's volleyball team has made it to the NCAA playoffs 
11 straight years. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be kicking butt to get some recognition around here," said running 
back Ross Bauer, formerly of El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, the Gauchos are getting some recognition. In fact, the 
Gauchos, who play their final game of the season today against Azusa Pacific, 
hope they'll be recognized in Division II next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a pretty natural progression for us," UCSB Coach Rick Candaele 
said. "I think it's plain to just about everyone that we've outgrown this 
division." 
</P>
<P>
And the main reason for that growth is the type and quality of player UCSB is 
getting these days. Players such as Fleming, the team's leading receiver who 
considered walking on at UCLA, or Bauer, the team's second leading rusher, or 
Mike Curtius, formerly of Mater Dei, the backup quarterback who was the 
Gauchos' starting quarterback last season. 
</P>
<P>
All were exceptional high school players, all had the talent to compete at a 
Division II program and some figured to have an outside shot at Division I. 
</P>
<P>
But, like so many of their teammates, they chose Santa Barbara for the 
academics and the atmosphere and found that college football could be fun, a 
word that's seldom heard at the major-college level. 
</P>
<P>
"You look around on this team and there are guys who could be playing at a 
higher level," Bauer said. "But a lot of us made the decision after high school 
that football wouldn't be our lives, we wanted to get on with other things. The 
guys who play here just play for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
That's fun if you enjoy practicing about four hours a day. The UCSB football 
team is not a bunch a guys in cutoff jeans heaving around a football or two and 
then heading out for a pizza. 
</P>
<P>
The team is remarkably intense, getting crazy even for the Menlo Colleges of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys love to play," Fleming said. "It's not like we come out here 
everyday and lay around in the sun. These guys are serious about the game, but 
they're looking for nothing to gain from football." 
</P>
<P>
And nothing is exactly what they get. No scholarships, no training table, there 
wasn't a football weight room until this season and that only came about when 
the team held a lift-a-thon to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Players from the previous year aren't even guaranteed a spot on the roster 
because the team holds open tryouts before each season. Interest in the program 
is growing, the 100 helmets aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of incentives, kids are practically knocking down the door of 
the small football office. At UCSB, recruiting is usually stuck in reverse with 
prospective players calling coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now our phones are ringing off the hook," said Steve Marks, receivers 
coach, and one of three men responsible for bringing football back to Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
It was Marks, Brad Tisdale and Gary Rhodes who organized an alumni game in 1982 
and that went so well they organized a club team in 1983. UCSB had played 
intercollegiate football for 50 years before dropping the program in 1971. The 
team went Division III in 1986 and has compiled an 18-11 record, but things 
have really been moving the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot better athlete coming in," said Charlie Brown, UCSB defensive end, 
who started with the program in 1986. "Guys like Fleming, who probably would 
have had a shot at bigger programs. These guys are starting to hear about us, 
because we keep improving and beating people. I think you're going to see that 
trend continue." 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos will have to get a special waiver to be in Division II by next 
season. But a bigger division won't mean any significant changes. The school 
will continue to offer no football scholarships. That's not unusual. UC Davis, 
a very successful Division II football team, offers no scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the situation here is unique and wonderful," Kasser said. "I don't 
think we would want to change a thing."

ODDS AND ENDS 
</P>
<P>
Tough Ticket: As expected, Capistrano Valley's quaint stadium was packed for 
the showdown between No. 1-ranked El Toro and No. 2-ranked Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fans began filling the stadium at 5 p.m. and the 3,500 bleacher seats were 
taken by 6 p.m. It was a hot ticket; just ask Mission Viejo mayor William 
Craycraft. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Craycraft telephoned Capistrano Valley principal Tom Anthony 
and asked if Anthony could reserve a couple of seats and a parking space at the 
school for his family. Anthony politely declined.

PAPAZIAN MARCHES ON FOR WHITTIER CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian High School will resume his assault on the 
Orange County single-season touchdown record today when Whittier Christian 
meets Miraleste at Miraleste in the teams' Olympic League finale. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound running back/linebacker, has scored 28 
touchdowns in nine games this season. He needs four more to tie the county 
record of 32, set in 1984 by Jim Farrell of Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian is tied for sixth on the all-time list with Willie Gittens, who scored 
28 touchdowns for Fountain Valley in 1978. Tied for second with 30 are Kerwin 
Bell of Edison (1979), Eric Fox of Capistrano Valley (1980) and Derek Brown of 
Servite (1988). Steve Morford scored 29 for Esperanza in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (9-0 overall, 4-0 in league play), the second-ranked team in 
the Southern Section Division IV, has outscored its opponents this season, 
330-64. In today's other game, Orange Lutheran will play host to Brethren at 2 
p.m.

TITANS HAVE MORE THAN ONE REASON TO BE WARY OF STRUGGLING LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton had reason to be wary of Cal State Long Beach before this 
week, courtesy of last season's memories. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had a nine-game losing streak stretching over two seasons when the 
teams met last year. But after a 32-yard Long Beach field goal with five 
seconds left against Fullerton, Long Beach had a 24-22 victory and the Titans 
had their most embarrassing loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
This week, after Long Beach Coach Larry Reisbig announced his resignation 
Thursday, saying he would coach the final two games, it gave Fullerton more 
reason to be wary. It's difficult to tell how that move will affect the Long 
Beach team when it meets Fullerton in the Titans' homecoming game at 1 p.m. 
today at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Reisbig has a 10-23 record in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Fullerton would seem to face little challenge from Long Beach, 
a 3-7 team that has beaten only one Division I team, winless New Mexico State. 
The other victories are over Cal State Northridge and Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
Five times this season, the 49ers have given up more than 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy, who has watched his teams sputter against 
lesser teams in the past, is cautious just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Paul Oates has led the 49ers, passing for 2,156 yards. Sean Foster 
has been the leading receiver. Derek Washington, a standout receiver who missed 
four games with shoulder injuries, returned last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (4-4-1, 3-2 in the Big West) are trying to win their final two games 
in order to finish with a winning record for the first time since 1985. 
Fullerton concludes its season next week on the road against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
The Record Watch: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Pringle, who tied the Division I national single-game rushing record 
with 357 yards last week, would have to average 225 yards a game in the final 
two games to break Obie Graves' Fullerton season record of 1,789 yards, set in 
1978. Graves was on hand last week when Pringle broke his one-game record of 
291 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fullerton quarterback Dan Speltz needs 62 yards passing to become the 
school's career leader, passing Damon Allen, whose record is 4,218 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speltz needs four completions to break Allen's record of 322. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speltz will set a school record for completion percentage even if he 
attempts 30 passes in each of the final two games and doesn't complete a single 
one. The record is 55.5%, set by Ronnie Barber in 1987. Speltz is completing 
69.8% of his passes. He is threatening the Big West record of 71% set by Long 
Beach's Doug Gaynor in 1985. He would break it if he completed 16 of 20 passes 
in each of the final two games. One secret to Speltz's success is the Titans' 
short passing game. Running a different offense last season, he completed 
49.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rocky Palamara, who already holds both the single-season and career 
reception and receiving yardage records, needs 28 yards to break his 
single-season yardage record, set last season. He is one touchdown pass shy of 
the career record of 16 held by Stan Chapman and Allen Pitts. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach leads the series against Fullerton, 11-6, but Fullerton 
has won four of the past six meetings. . . . Fullerton seniors to be recognized 
before today's final home game are John Bavaro, Bill Brennan, Dan Briones, Tim 
Byrnes, Don Chambers, Shaun Dennis, Tony Dill, Shawn Forristall, Tom Gang, Marc 
Hauser, Mark Hill, Tim Holland, Harold Jones, Laita Leatutufu, James Noel, Russ 
Oleyer, Rocky Palamara, Mike Pringle, Reggie Redding, Mike Schaffel, Neb 
Sormaz, Dan Speltz and Chris Wright.

John Burns of Saddleback College will suit up for his ninth game of the season 
when the Gauchos play host to Rancho Santiago at 7 p.m. tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Playing nine games in a season is usually no big deal. After all, the community 
college season is usually 10 games long -- unless you get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, Burns hadn't been able to avoid getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, a running back, played the first seven games as a senior at Mission 
Viejo High School in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second play of the eighth game against San Clemente, he took a 
handoff, went up the middle and was hit by several defenders. Burns was slammed 
to the ground and broke his collarbone, causing him to miss the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, 19, went to Saddleback in 1988 and moved into the starting lineup after 
one game because of a leg injury to starting running back Aly Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
Burns rushed for 459 yards in 96 tries, and caught 14 passes for 169 more in 
the first seven games, but his season ended early. 
</P>
<P>
Burns was hit in the left leg by a helmet, just as he caught the ball during 
practice. He flipped over, and came up limping. 
</P>
<P>
He iced his leg at first, but the pain remained strong. He had his leg 
examined, only to find out he had a broken bone in the lower part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really sort of funny at the doctors' office," Burns said. "I was 
standing up when the nurse came in with the X-ray. She told me to get off the 
leg right away, it was broken." 
</P>
<P>
Burns attended Saddleback's final two regular-season games on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
"I would stand there and people kept coming up and telling me it was too bad I 
wasn't playing," he said. "I just got sick of people always feeling sorry for 
me. It was just like in high school when I got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Burns came back this season with a couple of goals. He wanted to prove he could 
stay healthy and gain 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
So far he has stayed out of the doctors' office, and has rushed for a team-high 
760 yards in 157 carries with two games left. Burns also has caught 24 passes 
good for 249 yards. He also leads Saddleback with seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's Mission Conference Central Division 7 p.m. games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (7-1, 6-1, 2-1) at Saddleback (1-7, 1-6, 0-3) -- Saddleback has 
never lost in this series, but this appears to be Rancho Santiago's best 
chance. The Dons have the top offense in the conference, averaging 423 yards 
and 34 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman running back Estrus Crayton leads the conference in all-purpose 
yardage with 196 a game. He has scored 17 touchdowns this season and needs two 
more to tie the school record of 19 set in 1949 by Al Carmichael. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (8-0, 7-0, 3-0) at Fullerton (5-3, 4-3, 2-1) -- Riverside, ranked 
second in Southern California and fourth in the national J.C. Grid-Wire poll, 
can clinch a tie for the Central Division title with a victory. Fullerton has a 
solid chance for an upset mainly because of its strong defense against the 
rush. The Hornets allow a conference-low 82 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside is averaging a conference-high 259 yards a game led by running back 
Daryl McChristian's 1,285 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the Tigers elect to pass, things could be much more unpleasant 
for Fullerton. The Hornets are allowing 221 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (4-4, 4-3, 1-2) at Orange Coast (5-3, 4-3, 1-2) -- The district 
rivals get together for the 24th time with Golden West leading the series, 
12-9-2. Golden West is led on offense by sophomore running back Sean Cheatham, 
who has gained 838 yards in 163 carries. 
</P>
<P>
OCC hopes quarterback Greg Angelovic returns to form. Angelovic, a freshman, 
had five interceptions in the first seven games and had four last week in a 
33-17 loss to Riverside.

IRVINE CO. SIGNS LAW FIRM TO 15-YEAR, $60-MILLION LEASE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: DEAL WITH GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER IS CONSIDERED A COUP. IN 
TERMS OF DOLLARS, IT'S AMONG THE THREE BIGGEST DEALS IN COUNTY HISTORY.

<P>
The Irvine Co. has signed one of the largest leases in Orange County with the 
Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, a tenant several other large 
local developers had tried to lure into their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm's Orange County office agreed late Thursday to occupy five floors 
of a 20-story office tower -- when the building opens in May, 1992 -- at 
Jamboree Center. Construction should start within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. valued the lease -- which runs for 15 years and covers 111,000 
square feet of office space -- at more than $60 million. That makes it one of 
the three top leases, in dollar terms, ever signed in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Since more than a quarter of the office building's 400,000 square feet is now 
leased, the Irvine Co. can construct what will be the fifth and last office 
tower, known as 4 Park Plaza, at Jamboree Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the last office tower the company is likely to build in the Newport 
Beach and northern Irvine area for some time. The company says it has no more 
land suitable for office towers in those areas. So for the time being, the huge 
Newport Beach landowner and developer will build most of its new office 
buildings in its enormous Spectrum business park in southern Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Such large deals -- though by no means common -- are occurring more frequently 
as the county's economy grows. 
</P>
<P>
At $60 million, the Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher deal is about the same amount 
as the Irvine Co.'s shorter, 10-year lease signed last year with Western 
Digital for 380,000 square feet in a building in the Irvine Spectrum and 
another 10-year agreement between IBM and C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons signed in 
September for 164,000 square feet in a planned building near South Coast Plaza 
in Costa Mesa. Then there's also Taco Bell's lease with the Koll Co., signed in 
1986 for 260,000 square feet and estimated at about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those deals are thought to be the largest in the county so far. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only half a dozen tenants as large as Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher are 
now looking for office space in Orange County. With average vacancy rates high 
-- more than 20% countywide -- in local office buildings, the competition for 
these tenants is intense. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm had been courted by the Koll Co., a big Newport Beach developer 
that almost had a deal sewn up after lengthy negotiations. The law firm then 
held talks with Laguna Niguel developer Birtcher, according to local real 
estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the law firm settled on the Irvine Co. was that the developer now 
has a building permit in hand for its new office tower, said Tooley &amp; Co., 
a Los Angeles firm that manages Jamboree Center for the Irvine Co. and which 
negotiated the Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher lease. The other developers do not 
yet have permits for their office buildings, and the law firm was said to be 
concerned that the city of Irvine might delay or withhold those building 
permits as it grows concerned about rapid growth near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with the Irvine Co. was negotiated in a little more than two weeks, an 
unusually short time for such a large deal. "I've never seen one go through 
that fast," said Dick Sim, president of the Irvine Co.'s Investment Properties 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm -- the state's largest -- now occupies 68,000 square feet at the 
Pacific Mutual Plaza building in Newport Beach's Newport Center, a stone's 
throw from the Irvine Co. headquarters. Pacific Mutual Plaza was sold last year 
by the life insurance company to the state teachers pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm employs 400 lawyers and other workers in Orange County. It has 
been looking for larger quarters for nearly three years. It will occupy five 
floors in the new building, from the 14th to the 18th. The Irvine Co. will try 
to lease the top two floors at even higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's five largest law firms with 700 lawyers, Gibson, Dunn &amp; 
Crutcher specializes in banking law, corporate securities, finance, real 
estate, tax and labor law. The law firm said Friday it picked Jamboree Center 
because the new building gave the law firm room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's lease at Pacific Mutual Plaza expires about the same time 4 Park 
Plaza is scheduled to open. That means the Irvine Co. won't have to buy the law 
firm out of its lease, a practice some landlords have used to lure tenants into 
their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Irvine Co. says most of its buildings run much lower vacancy 
rates than the average because of their exceptional locations, the company 
admits it had to make concessions to Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. But neither 
side will say what the concessions were, though they probably include the usual 
sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 Park Plaza office tower is the fifth and last office building planned for 
Jamboree Center, which will have 1.6 million square feet of office space. 
</P>
<P>
The $85-million 4 Park Plaza building will be identical to 5 Park Plaza, a 
20-story building with a white marble exterior that opened earlier this year 
with the Geneva Cos. as anchor tenant. That building is 75% leased. 
</P>
<P>
Another identical building, 3 Park Plaza, is under construction and scheduled 
to open late next year. There is no anchor tenant for that building, but the 
company said it had leased so much space at Jamboree Center that it decided to 
construct the building anyway. All three buildings have 400,000 square feet of 
space.

HOME SALES IN COUNTY DROP 12% IN OCTOBER 
</P>

<P>
Orange County home sales continued to drop in October, TRW Real Estate 
Information Services reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
During the month, 3,600 homes were sold in the county, down 12% from the 4,100 
sold in September. Compared to October, 1988, last month's sales looked even 
worse: down 27% from the 4,900 sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
TRW counts all types of homes -- new and used, houses and condominiums -- in 
its monthly survey. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a home fell slightly in October, dropping 0.4% from $261,100 in 
September to $260,200 in October. 
</P>
<P>
However, home prices were 19% higher than the average $219,300 in October, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Experts blame high housing prices in most of the state's larger urban areas for 
slowing sales this year. That has finally begun to slow price increases, which 
are expected to be lower this year than last. 
</P>
<P>

WALT DISNEY CO. ENJOYS A FANTASTIC YEAR 
</P>

missing in Friday's Times Orange County Edition. It is reprinted here in its 
entirety. 
</P>
<P>
Boosted by Bambi, four shrunken children and a crush of amusement park 
visitors, Walt Disney Co. on Thursday reported record revenue and net income 
for the three months and the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner and President Frank G. 
Wells attributed the Burbank company's performance to "outstanding results" 
from all of Disney's business segments: theme parks and resorts, filmed 
entertainment and consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter net income rose 56% to $212.7 million and revenue increased 33% 
to $1.35 billion. Net income for the fiscal year reached $703.3 million, up 
35%, on revenue of $4.6 billion, up 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Pretax operating income jumped 62% to $373.1 million for the quarter and 39% to 
$1.2 billion for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street was not surprised by the record results, said Paul C. Marsh, an 
analyst with Batemen Eichler, Hill Richards, a brokerage in Los Angeles. "Now 
we're all sharpening our pencils for the next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern in the initial part of the year that 'Honey, I Shrunk 
the Kids' and 'Dead Poets Society' would not measure up to the previous year's 
slate of films," Marsh said. "The fact is, those films did quite well." 
</P>
<P>
"Honey" and "Dead Poets" have grossed more than $127 million and $93 million, 
respectively, at the U.S. box office so far this year. The company's "Turner 
and Hooch" has also performed well, grossing more than $68 million through last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's theme parks "have had a gang-buster year" and the company's video 
release of "Bambi" and "Cinderella" was "a prudent marketing ploy and a prudent 
accounting ploy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's retail store sales total about $1,100 per square foot -- about four 
times the industry average -- compared to $850 per square foot earlier this 
year, Marsh said. The company expects to operate 41 Disney Stores at the end of 
the calendar year, up from 13 at the end of 1988, a spokesman for the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's theme parks and resorts recorded a 44% increase in operating income to 
$240.9 million for the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 25% to $775.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The filmed entertainment segment had fourth-quarter operating income of $85.9 
million, nearly three times the previous year's total. Revenue was up 49% to 
$462.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer products segment earned $46.3 million, up 38%, on revenue of 
$107.3 million, up 27%.

HAMMOND, IRVINE SUITOR AGREE ON STANDSTILL

<P>
The Hammond Co., trying since May to shake the advances of an unwanted suitor, 
on Friday reached another temporary standstill agreement with a potential 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said Fidelity National Financial Inc. of Irvine has agreed not to 
purchase any more of Hammond's stock for six months. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Hammond will provide Fidelity with information about its business 
and finances. 
</P>
<P>
The information will enable Fidelity National, a real estate title insurance 
company, to decide whether to make a formal offer for Hammond. Fidelity owns 
23.6% of Hammond's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond is one of a handful of publicly traded mortgage brokers in the nation. 
Fidelity bought a 16.3% stake in the company in May and said then that it was 
doing so for investment purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
But in late September, after increasing its holdings to 23.6%, Fidelity filed a 
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which the company said 
it was considering launching a tender offer for control of Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
When Fidelity first started buying Hammond's stock, the shares were trading at 
or below the company's June 30 book value of $4.49 and Fidelity officials said 
they were only interested in acquiring stock if the price stayed at that level. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 2, when Fidelity's SEC filing was made public, Hammond's stock price 
jumped $1.50 a share to close the day at $5.88. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the stock has inched steadily upward, closing Friday at $7.50 a 
share, an increase of 12 1/2 cents for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity has entered four standstill agreements with Hammond since 
mid-September, promising each time not to buy more of the company's shares for 
a specified period.

NEWPORT DECIDES NOT TO CONSIDER MUSEUM MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
ART: DECISION COMES AFTER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FORMING A CLOSER WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAGUNA INSTITUTION.

Board members of the Newport Harbor Art Museum notified officials at the Laguna 
Art Museum on Friday that, for various reasons, "it is not an appropriate time 
to consider a merger of the two museums." 
</P>
<P>
The statement came after recent discussions at the two facilities about forming 
a closer working relationship, including the possibility of a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna museum, said talk of a merger was 
strictly speculative to begin with and that the Newport museum's stance "makes 
a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna museum in September established a committee to explore the 
possibility of a merger with the Newport museum, which later formed a similar 
committee. The committees have not met jointly, both museums reported. 
</P>
<P>
After the Newport museum's merger committee discussed the issue and conferred 
with the museum board's executive committee, the entire board on Thursday 
approved a "statement regarding Laguna Art Museum merger inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
That statement, later delivered to Laguna museum officials, said: "In view of 
the activities under way at the (Newport) museum, including the search for a 
new director, the resolution of the building program for the new museum 
building, and the initiation of the Museum Building and Endowment Fund 
Campaign, it is not an appropriate time to consider a merger of the two 
museums." 
</P>
<P>
The search for a replacement for director Kevin E. Consey was started when he 
announced his resignation in August to take a similar post at the Chicago 
Museum of Contemporary Art. The Newport museum also is refining design details 
for a new facility and has raised about $10 million toward a $50-million drive 
for the new building and an endowment, a museum spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport trustee Jay M. Young, merger committee chairman, said, "We wish to 
remain good neighbors with the Laguna Art Museum and continue to cooperate with 
the museum and other museums in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said Laguna officials established a merger committee in reaction to 
suggestions by some Laguna museum members for a closer cooperation with Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious they feel the need to focus on their capital campaign and their 
(search for a new) director, and that seems to be a perfectly resonable 
approach to museum business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We already do cooperate better than we have in the past and that's 
going to be a natural continuing progression. When I say cooperation, I am 
certainly not talking about a merger, but there are a lot of ways we can work 
together." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Desmarais noted that two Newport museum staff members are on the 
Committee for an Orange County Arts Council that he chairs. The ad-hoc group of 
local arts community members is working to establish a countywide arts service 
organization.

<P>
THREE O.C. SHELTERS OFFER VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE HAVEN AND HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Metro section. This is her first article for Life.

<P>
The sounds of birds, children's laughter and a running dishwasher in the 
peaceful setting of a Laguna Beach house give no indication of the violence 
from which the occupants have fled. From the outside, Human Options, one of 
three shelters for battered women in Orange County, looks like any other 
comfortable upper-middle-class home. 
</P>
<P>
In plant-filled rooms, individually decorated by various community groups, 
stuffed animals are piled on beds and cribs for the nine children under the age 
of 4 who currently live there. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected everyone to have broken bones when I came in," said a former 
resident of Human Options. "But there's more to abuse than injuries that show." 
</P>
<P>
Although five years have passed since the woman escaped to the shelter, she 
wept while talking about her past. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband "didn't beat me outright like a lot of traditional cases," said the 
44-year-old mother of two. "Some men are more sophisticated now and don't want 
to leave bruises. He'd make wild accusations, threaten to kill my boss, wreck 
my car, follow me, shake me, pin me down, squeeze my wrists. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One day she left home. Unlike some others, she never went back. 
</P>
<P>
For Vivian Clecak , executive director of the two-story Human Options home, the 
woman's story is all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one-third of all families in the nation experience some 
form of chronic abuse -- some physical, some verbal -- and affluent Orange 
County "definitely parallels" those figures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just physical abuse that's a problem," she said, adding that the 
problem affects all economic and social groups. "Verbal abuse almost always 
escalates into physical violence. It might start with a man throwing a plate 
against the wall, but it usually doesn't end there." 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the California Department of Justice, more 
than 11,000 domestic violence calls were received by Orange County police 
departments last year. Almost 8,000 of those calls involved weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The hot lines run by the three battered women shelters in Orange County field 
more than 12,000 calls a year. Safety Net, an emergency housing program that 
uses motels, receives an additional 2,400 calls each year. 
</P>
<P>
And experts say fewer than half of all the cases of domestic violence are even 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
So it is here that the victims of domestic violence seek refuge. They are 
welcomed to stay 30 to 45 days at no cost. The shelter, which provides meals 
and counseling services, is funded by both public money and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed 24 hours a day, it also provides community education, referrals and 
counseling for men prone to violence. 
</P>
<P>
The house is full today, its six bedrooms and 17 beds occupied by those who 
have fled the violence of others. The other two shelters -- the 50-bed Women's 
Transitional Living Center in North County and the the 36-bed Interval House in 
the western part of the county -- also are full. And experts say if there were 
more shelters, they too would be booked. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County should hang its head in shame," says Carol Hatch, executive 
director of the Commission on the Status of Women in Santa Ana. "We're dealing 
with freeways and the cost of living instead of the fact that a woman gets 
battered every 15 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch and other experts complain that domestic violence cases are often 
misunderstood both by the victims and the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Less than half are reported," she said. "Police aren't called until it gets 
really bad. And then the message is too often: 'Stay there and we'll come back 
when it's a homicide.' It is incredible that there were only 600 felony arrests 
in Orange County last year." 
</P>
<P>
Clecak said people often don't know what abuse is and therefore minimize the 
seriousness of the problem. Abuse, she said, is any verbal or physical 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
And women are not the only victims. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter directors say all of the children coming into their facilities have 
been emotionally abused, and half of them also have been physically and 
sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Chrissy is like many of the women who end up in the shelters for battered women 
-- afraid, alone and reluctant to use her real name. 
</P>
<P>
Now a "graduate" of Human Options, she has gone on to graduate from Carter 
Business School in Tustin and is putting her life back in order. 
</P>
<P>
After years of being physically abused by her husband, she first stayed with 
neighbors before going to the Laguna Beach shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better about myself now," said Chrissy, a mother of three who had 
no job skills before going to Human Options. "I want people to realize they can 
do something with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Every since I was 5 years old, I've always been hurt. Now I'm 24 years old, 
and I realize I have a place in this world." 
</P>
<P>
Chrissy said that she was abused by her father and that her husband had 
witnessed his own mother being beaten by his father. Her own children are now 
in counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my son to grow up beating women, and I don't want my daughters 
growing up to be beaten by men," she said. "I had to break the cycle. I drew 
the line here."

IT WILL BE 1939 ALL OVER AGAIN FOR LIDO CINEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As a boy, J.E.T. Rutter spent his Saturday afternoons watching Buck Rogers 
movies at the Lido Cinema -- in those days the swankiest theater in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When he got older, he and his friends would go to the theater to "mess around" 
-- releasing jars of moths from the balcony after the lights went out, sipping 
Cokes spiked with rum they'd smuggled past the ushers and sneaking peeks at the 
couples making out in the back rows. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I never put my Coke in my popcorn and tossed it over the balcony," 
Rutter says innocently. 
</P>
<P>
Rutter and the Lido grew up together. He was just 8 years old when the theater 
opened in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
The Lido will celebrate its 50th anniversary Thursday with a gala fund-raiser 
to benefit the Newport Harbor Nautical Museum, and Rutter will be there. As 
president of the museum, he will present a slide show of the harbor's early 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Among those also attending will be Pete Barrett, 64, a Newport Beach resident 
since 1938 who remembers the hoopla of the Lido's opening night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a teen-ager and we were all really excited," Barrett recalls. "The Lido 
was the biggest thing in town. There were a couple of other theaters in the 
area, but nothing as grand as what they had built -- it was different from 
anything we'd ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Built by the Griffith Co. for the then impressive sum of $100,000, the theater 
was the sole building at the entrance to the Lido peninsula, an area now 
crammed with tall banks and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It sat out there in the open with the tumbleweeds rolling by," says Joe 
Carver, a 79-year-old Newport Beach resident who was 29 when the Lido opened. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers of the day touted the Lido's "modern Mediterranean style of 
architecture, in complete harmony with the homes on Lido Isle." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the building had more of an art deco design. With its long decorative 
columns and round marquee, the pink cement building stood out like a lavish 
birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty fancy, even for '39 when they built bigger theaters," Rutter 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Local papers also lauded the theater's 800 "slide in" seats, "with velour 
upholstering, the final word in ease and comfort," a 15-by-23-foot screen that 
"can be seen from every chair without undue craning of necks," rust and gold 
velour curtains and a new projector that "eliminates much of the flicker . . . 
heralded as a great saver on the eyes of moviegoers." 
</P>
<P>
What really amazed residents, however, were the murals of underwater scenes 
painted on the huge theater walls in newly developed fluorescent paint. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first theater with fluorescent paint, and they just thought that 
was the cat's pajamas," Rutter says. 
</P>
<P>
The General Electric Co. had introduced the paint only months before. When 
shown under ultra violet light, brightly colored fish glowed in the darkened 
auditorium. One over-enthusiastic reporter promised: " . . . the Ultra (Violet) 
Ray kills all germs and purifies the air in the building, so if you go in with 
your clothes full of -- well, things -- you come out clean as the driven snow." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Mason Siler owned and operated the theater until 12 years ago, when he 
sold it to Edwards Theatre Circuit Inc. Siler promised to show only first-run 
movies in his new theater, and set an admission price of 25 cents for adults, 
10 cents for children. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime Newport Beach residents, including Barrett, took their first 
dates to the Lido. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Ritter has lived in Newport Beach since she was 6 and worked as a cashier 
at the Lido during her senior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lido was new, pretty and exciting -- a fun place to work," Ritter says. "I 
sold the tickets, and they said I filled the theater faster than everyone. 
That's my big claim to fame." 
</P>
<P>
Years passed, and the Lido began to show its age. The seats and carpeting 
became worn and dingy. The high ceiling, painted with waves so that, as one 
newspaper gushed, one could imagine "a vast boat on an iridescent sea," became 
discolored and stained with water. 
</P>
<P>
Many old theaters decay and die, the victims of neglect. Instead of abandoning 
the Lido, Edwards is spending about $250,000 to "bring the theater back to the 
spit and polish of its heyday," says James Edwards III, president of Edwards 
Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have been sandblasting the outside of the Lido and painting it a pale 
salmon color similar to its original pink hue. Inside, they're putting in new 
drapes, carpeting and seats. The theater's legendary murals are being touched 
up with fluorescent paint. 
</P>
<P>
Those who attend the gala anniversary will find a restored Lido. A searchlight 
used at the 1939 grand opening will guide guests to the party. A red carpet 
will be rolled out to greet guests Hollywood-style. Antique cars will be parked 
near the theater and old-time newsboys will hand out copies of papers from 
1939. Movie star impersonators will mingle with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
A wine and hors d'oeuvres reception catered by Pavilions Place at the Via Lido 
Plaza will begin at 6:30 p.m. The historical slide show will begin at 7:30 
p.m., followed by a showing of a 1939 Donald Duck cartoon and the movie 
"Hollywood Cavalcade," the first film to be shown at the Lido. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Edwards Sr. will open a time capsule buried at the 1939 opening containing 
old newspapers and signatures of guests at the opening. Those attending the 
gala can sign a scroll to be placed in the 1989 time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee and dessert will follow the program. The gala costs $50 per person and 
is sponsored by Edwards Theatres, the Vons Cos. and the Fritz Duda Co., owner 
of the Via Lido Plaza where the theater is located.

DISCOVERY: THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHOPPE

<P>
From the moment you walk through the flowered entrance of the Children's 
Bookshoppe, an aura of literary wealth surrounds the visitor. The big red door 
with its painted drummer boy and genuine straw hat is an entree to 
floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall bookshelves, spilling over with every type of 
children's book imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
One small section, toward the rear of the shop, has a make-believe fireplace 
draped on the wall with downsized furniture, including a bench, rocking chairs 
with pillows and small tables. In the same area are nifty little specialty 
gifts. The reasonable prices permit children to shop, using, perhaps, their 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Another separate small room is well-stocked with paperbacks, cassettes and 
videos only. A neighboring room, very narrow, is used for gift-wrapping and 
mailings. The shop will special order and mail books anywhere, on request. 
</P>
<P>
A special service this store renders is its children's book club membership.

JOSEPH N. BELL: A WELCOME LETTER FROM DISTANT PAST

<P>
We are all instinctively collectors, and the temptation to hang onto anything 
that has been even minutely significant to us is overpowering. And so, 
periodically, when there is no longer any room to store things, we clean out 
the accumulation -- and then start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
When I decide to clean out, I usually take no prisoners. Everything goes. The 
alternative is to find oneself sitting and reading and dreaming over each scrap 
of paper and faded picture until they become precious all over again and simply 
can't be destroyed. But there's also an enormous risk in tossing out 
indiscriminately. For example, it has occurred to me frequently in recent 
months that if I had kept my baseball card collection, alone, I'd be 
independently wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
But that thought became downright frivolous a few days ago when I almost threw 
away something of priceless value. I was going rapidly through a box of old 
clippings and magazines and documents, preparatory to throwing them out, when 
from the folds of a dog-eared magazine fell a tiny, faded blue notebook that I 
recognized instantly. It was my grandfather's Civil War diary that my mother 
had given me many years ago and that I had somehow misplaced and feared I had 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
I clutched it with enormous gratitude and sat down instantly to leaf through 
it. It covers a rather brief period in 1864 when my grandfather was fighting 
with Gen. Sherman in Georgia and is written in a tiny, fading script difficult 
to read. So I was feeling rather than reading it, taking it in through my skin, 
riffling the pages, when I made another glorious discovery. The first page of a 
yellowed letter fell out of the book into my lap. I had never seen it before. 
</P>
<P>
It was headed, "U.S.A. General Hospital No. 3, Lookout Mt. Tennessee," and it 
was dated "April the 7th, 1865." It was addressed to "Sophia Beery," the maiden 
name of my maternal grandmother. And it was a love letter. A tender and 
poignant love letter. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long time," wrote my grandfather, "since I heard from you. I 
expect you didn't get my last letter. If you had, I think I should have heard 
from you some time ago. . . . When I get a letter from you, it brings back to 
memory the happy hours I spent with you last Fall and it brightens my mind with 
a new hope that I may have the privilege of spending a few more happy hours in 
the future with the one I admire. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh how my heart would beat with joy if I knew you loved me as I love you. You 
must excuse me for writing so plain on this subject. I wouldn't be so bold if I 
thought anyone else would see my letters but you. I believe you have more 
respect for me than to show my letters to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Sophia, if it should be the case that you are tired of corresponding with 
someone who loves you, for my sake show no person my letters. Not that I care 
who knows I love you for I am certain it is no disgrace to love as good and 
nice a girl as you are. It would be an honor, if anything. Sophia, do not look 
on this as mere flattery, for I am sincere in what I write you. 
</P>
<P>
With good intentions on my mind, 
</P>
<P>
 You will in me a true friend find; 
</P>
<P>
 And when you find one kind and true, 
</P>
<P>
 Don't change an old one for a new. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a letter from Sarah Stephenson a few days ago, and she told me you 
and her had a good time. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And there the page ended, and there were no others. Only one page, written on 
both sides in a beautiful script that looked almost like calligraphy. I 
wondered if my grandfather had written the letter himself or if some angel of 
mercy, helping the wounded soldiers, had written it for him. I think he wrote 
it himself. I don't believe he would have entrusted it to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather, Robert Patterson, married Sophia Beery two years after he 
returned from the Civil War. They had seven children, two boys who died in 
infancy and five girls they raised in Decatur, Ind., where my grandfather was 
the town miller. My mother was his youngest daughter, and she was only 7 when 
her mother died. Her father lived to a ripe old age, but not long enough for me 
to know him. He died 10 years before I was born. 
</P>
<P>
So my only portrait of him -- before I found this letter -- comes from my 
parents. And mostly from my father. I used to love to listen when my father and 
my uncles got together and talked about the old man, in nominal charge of five 
beautiful young women, each of whom was a catch for the young men in Decatur. 
My grandfather had been a captain in the Union Army, the survivor of many 
battles as Sherman fought his way through the South. He had been wounded and 
decorated and had come home to be a pillar of his community. 
</P>
<P>
But the picture that my father and my uncles always painted was of a crusty old 
man sitting in a rocker on his front porch telling war stories. The young men 
in Decatur would come courting, and my grandfather -- probably to his 
daughters' great embarrassment -- would regale the swain with war stories, 
stories that got better with each telling. 
</P>
<P>
That's the only picture I carried of my grandfather, and the picture of my 
grandmother was even more amorphous. My father had never known her, and when my 
mother talked about her, it was in almost saintly terms. I have stood many 
times at my grandparents' graves and wished I might have known them. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, a frayed letter drops out of a diary and they 
become people to me. A lovesick young man dreaming and hoping in a battlefield 
hospital. And a beautiful and desirable young woman, distant and unattainable, 
but beginning to look in his direction. I loved the crusty old man with his war 
stories and the saintly woman who died long before her time. But I love these 
two people even more. They paid me a visit the other day, and now I can bring 
them back whenever I choose. And I may very well never throw anything away 
again.
