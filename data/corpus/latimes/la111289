THE NEW RIGHT AGAINST THE OLD RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
THE TEMPTING OF AMERICA: THE POLITICAL SEDUCTION OF THE LAW BY ROBERT H. BORK 
(THE FREE PRESS: $22.95; 388 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonard W. Levy, Levy, who teaches constitutional history at The Claremont 
Graduate School, is editor of the Encyclopedia of the American Constitution 
(Macmillan) and author of Original Intent and the Framer's Constitution 
(Macmillan). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, the Senate rejected the nomination of Robert Bork by the largest vote 
in history against a nominee for the Supreme Court, although he was 
preeminently qualified. His constitutional opinions, which accounted for the 
nomination, brought his defeat. Bork provoked intense opposition because he was 
perceived as a conservative judicial activist who had made himself a symbol of 
opposition to liberal activism. He remains the nation's foremost theoretician 
of a constitutional jurisprudence of originalism, or original meaning: "All 
that counts is how the words used in the Constitution would have been 
understood at the time the Constitution was ratified." 
</P>
<P>
This book solidifies Bork's position as an intellectual role model for scores 
of federal judges appointed by President Reagan. The book also elaborately 
defends Bork's views and explains his defeat by "left-liberal" pressure groups 
that, he alleges, politicized the judicial process. The title of the book 
refers to "the temptation of results without regard to democratic legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
In his first section, Bork surveys the history of judicial activism. He depicts 
an increasing politicization and leftward movement of the Court from 
liberty-oriented doctrines to equality-oriented ones. Judicial activism began 
with the first decision on constitutional law. It reached an ugly climax in the 
years following the Civil War, when the Court savaged congressional 
civil-rights laws and betrayed the 14th Amendment's promise of equal 
citizenship. Bork omits this bleak chapter of our judicial history, conserving 
his space to lambaste the Warren Court for its activism in the cause of 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle part of the book, Bork criticizes theorists, left and right, who 
support judicial activism -- that is, deciding on a basis other than Bork's 
concept of original understanding or intent. Finally, he narrates the story of 
his own confirmation ordeal. He places the rejection of his nomination in the 
context of a "war" for control of the legal culture and even for America's 
soul. The book will confirm the beliefs both of Bork's liberal opponents and 
conservative supporters. Unfortunately, Bork, who inhabits a Manichaean 
universe, does not address himself to moderates who endorse judicial restraint 
without embracing his brand of originalism. 
</P>
<P>
Bork claims that "liberal elites" seek to destroy the idea of the rule of law 
and make the philosophy of originalism a disqualification for judicial office. 
That claim conflicts with the confirmation of William Rehnquist as chief 
justice and the unanimous confirmations of Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, 
who share many of Bork's views. Moreover, Bork initially had the support of 
moderates and some liberals. When Sen. Edward Kennedy demagogically distorted 
Bork's record to inspire a fear of him, I wrote to congratulate Bork on his 
nomination and to wish him well. I thought he should be judged on the basis of 
his judicial record and believed that his opinions would not be predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Before the final vote on Bork's nomination, however, several studies of his 
opinions strongly indicated a systematic hostility to feminists, blacks, gays 
and labor. Bork angrily disputes these accusations. He takes none of the blame 
for his defeat, alleging that the hearings, including his five days of 
testimony, changed "no one's mind." In fact, he lost several initially 
indecisive senators including Southern Democrats and members of his own party. 
He waffled on numerous issues, causing some to declare that they did not 
understand him and others to speak of his "confirmation conversion." 
</P>
<P>
This distempered book fails as a defense of originalist jurisprudence because 
originalism rests on the views of the founders, and Bork, as a historian, is 
ignorant. Moreover, the historical sources are simply inadequate to provide a 
viable constitutional jurisprudence that will decide actual cases. Bork 
emphasizes ratifier intent, but we don't even have the records of the 
proceedings of most state-ratifying conventions, and those that we do have are 
often unreliable. What Bork wants from history is a premise or principle to 
apply to constitutional issues, but he acknowledges that history yields various 
and conflicting premises and that able and sincere originalist judges who apply 
the same premises can reach differing results. 
</P>
<P>
Bork himself has employed discrepant premises and reached discrepant results at 
various times. In a 1968 Fortune article, for example, he favored "legitimate 
activism" and found a warrant for it in the 9th Amendment, which says that the 
enumeration of rights should not be construed to deny or disparage other 
rights. To Bork, that meant that the Bill of Rights "is an incomplete, 
open-ended document, and that the work of completion is, at least in major 
part, a task for the Supreme Court." The amendment extended the range of 
individual freedoms "far beyond the text of the Constitution." From that 
amendment and enumerated rights, judges should properly draw "new natural 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Today that is all anathema to Bork. When the grand theorist of originalism 
changes his mind, the theory -- which is supposed to yield impersonal results 
free from judicial subjectivity -- loses credibility. What originalists 
attribute to the wisdom of the founders turns out to be their own wisdom 
dressed in 18th-Century ruffles. 
</P>
<P>
Bork's 1989 wisdom shrivels most old rights and regards new ones as 
"preposterous." He equates federalism and states rights, arguing that if a 
state discriminates on grounds of race or religion, the injured parties are 
free to emigrate. "In this sense, federalism is the constitutional guarantee 
most protective of the individual's freedom to make his own choices." 
Similarly, Bork in 1963 believed that an act of Congress outlawing racial 
discrimination in hotels and theaters and restaurants would infringe on the 
rights of white-supremacist business owners. Today he repudiates that position, 
but I doubt that he would have voted to sustain the constitutional authority of 
Congress to enact the statute. 
</P>
<P>
Any right not mentioned in the Constitution doesn't have constitutional 
existence, according to Bork -- not a right to privacy, to have an abortion, to 
practice contraception, or any right that is not enumerated. ("Liberty," it 
seems, is not an enumeration.) Yet Bork is wonderfully inconsistent. Although 
the 4th Amendment protects "papers" and not "words" against unreasonable 
searches, and although the founders knew about eavesdropping and did not 
protect against it, Bork derives a right against electronic eavesdropping. 
Here, he says, judges must understand rights in the context of changing 
circumstances, rather than allow them to become meaningless. He refuses, 
however, to acknowledge that the equal-protection clause has a similar capacity 
for adaptation to a changed world -- or even that it means what it says. "The 
equal protection of the laws" contains no limitation to any particular group of 
beneficiaries, and the clause immediately follows the 14th Amendment's general 
declaration of citizenship. Yet Bork now regards the guarantee of equal 
protection as restricted to a historical intent to forbid racial 
discrimination. On this view, equal protection offers nothing to women, aliens, 
homosexuals or the aged. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bork argues, the Constitution means what it says when it says what he 
means. Sometimes the literal words should govern; sometimes the words should be 
taken to embody a larger general principle; sometimes original purpose should 
triumph over the words. As Bork says, an honest judge "knows that he often 
intuits a conclusion" and then finds supporting reasons. That proposition is 
undeniable, and this book is Exhibit A.

MAGGIE THATCHER AS CROMWELL REDUX; 
</P>
<P>
THE IRON LADY: A BIOGRAPHY OF MARGARET THATCHER BY HUGO YOUNG (FARRAR, STRAUS 
&amp; GIROUX: $25; 570 PP.; 0-374-22651-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Williams, Born in Los Angeles and educated at Oxford University, 
Williams has covered the Thatcher revolution from Britain since 1980. He now 
divides his year between Tokyo, where he is an editorial writer for the Japan 
Times, and London, where he is correspondent for Tokyo Business Today. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two aspects of the Margaret Thatcher phenomenon -- neither of which 
is addressed in this splendid British biography -- that every thinking American 
needs to keep in mind when assessing the achievements of this remarkable woman. 
</P>
<P>
First is her contribution to global diplomacy. A quarter of a century after 
Dean Acheson's remark that "Great Britain has lost an Empire and has not yet 
found a role" (as Truman's secretary of state he would have known), Thatcher 
has created a noble task for her country: keeping American foreign policy on 
course. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration was struggling to acquire its sea legs earlier 
this year, it was Thatcher who traveled to South Africa to urge reform on P. W. 
Botha and patience from the front-line states. It was she who went to Germany 
to try and win Helmut Kohl's cooperation in the modernization of NATO's 
short-range nuclear arsenal. Above all, Thatcher demonstrated that the 
psychological advantage in the arms-reduction stakes was not the exclusive 
possession of Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Our need for her persists. Never was this more evident than during her recent 
trip to Japan. As the result of Ronald Reagan's departure from the White House 
and Mike Mansfield's from our embassy in Tokyo, America and Japan have begun to 
drift toward the Pacific's worse diplomatic crisis since the autumn of 1941. 
</P>
<P>
At this sensitive hour, the world's free-trading system and the Western 
alliance have suffered for lack of an eloquent and forceful voice to speak in 
defense of that system and that alliance. Here, as elsewhere, the British 
leader has attempted to fill the breach. 
</P>
<P>
The second feature of the Thatcher revolution that Americans should ponder is 
how she has exercised power. Contrary to jolly talk by American conservatives 
about electing Thatcher President here, her reign (the word is not used 
lightly) demonstrates the profound gap between American and British conceptions 
of the limits of state power. To the notion of Thatcher as an "elected 
dictator," I shall return. 
</P>
<P>
This is a frankly revisionist view. It sees Thatcher as the new Metternich (the 
19th-Century master of the diplomatic finesse), as a power-driven politician 
and as a militant Puritan. In this same revisionist mold, Hugo Young, the 
distinguished British journalist, has performed a brilliant dissection of the 
notion of Thatcher as a conservative icon. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Iron Lady," Young traces the winding staircase of fortune that 
transformed the younger daughter of a provincial English grocer into the 
greatest woman political leader since Catherine the Great. It is without 
question the best of a bevy of new Thatcher biographies that set out the often 
surprising, always dramatic story of the British political revolution of the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
It also will leave the thinking conservative scratching his head. To read Young 
is to discover that certain suspect analogies have informed the American 
perception of Thatcher as a conservative heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the assumption that Thatcher's road to Damascus parallels Ronald 
Reagan's own timely evolution from New Deal enthusiast to conservative 
idealogue, nor the thesis that the Iron Lady took the Tory party by storm in a 
political coup a la Barry Goldwater, survives Young's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In ideological terms, the author makes it clear that, her paternal education in 
conservative sentiment aside, not only did Thatcher come to the true faith much 
later than Reagan, but that between 1959 (when she first entered Parliament) 
and her crucial battle with Edward Heath for leadership of the Tory party in 
1974, Thatcher had barely two conservative ideas to rub together. No fully 
armed Athena emerging from the head of F. A. Hayek was she. 
</P>
<P>
Young makes a persuasive case for the view that Thatcher's less-than-true-blue 
ideology was mirrored in her policies. As minister of education in the 1970-74 
Heath government, she was not only a vigorous abolisher of private schools but 
also one of the great spenders of taxpayers' money. Later, as shadow 
environment secretary, her ideas were distinctly interventionist. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Thatcher became party leader in 1975 -- almost by accident -- 
realism and power politics, not conservative ideals, defined her program. The 
Tory campaign manifesto drawn up for the 1979 election that made Thatcher prime 
minister, in Young's words, "openly contemplated the perpetuation of the 
comfortable welfare state." The only company nominated by Thatcher's team for 
denationalization was the National Freight Corp., and this from the people who 
much later made "privatization" one of the household words of the age. 
</P>
<P>
What transformed Thatcher into a conservative revolutionary was the capture of 
power. Cunningly seized, then almost lost in the run-up to the 1982 Falklands 
war, it was only finally secured in the triumphant aftermath of her smashing 
1983 victory at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
In this twilight struggle for domination, it was not only the party's 
influential "wets" who stood in Thatcher's way but also Britain's formidable 
higher bureaucracy. Young observes that "There was a genuine clash of cultures, 
between an almost Cromwellian impatience with the status quo (on the part of 
the Thatcherites) and the mandarin world of Whitehall, in which skepticism and 
rumination were more highly rated habits of mind than zeal or blind 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
The motif of "Cromwellian impatience" bears brooding on. Cromwell was the 
17th-Century Puritan general who shattered royal power in Britain. By spilling 
the blood of Charles I, Cromwell hammered home the doctrine of parliamentary 
supremacy. He helped make Britain a "more perfect" unitary state: a nation with 
but a single supreme unit of government. 
</P>
<P>
For American conservatives, this is more than a lesson in foreign history. It 
was against Cromwell's legacy of centralized power that our forefathers 
revolted in 1776, but this same Cromwellian inheritance, adapted to modern 
circumstance, has been a crucial instrument in Thatcher's drive to force the 
British to be free. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's achievement of almost dictatorial powers since 1983 forms the key 
chapter in the secret history of her reign. The implied paradox has been nicely 
captured by a recent British assessment of the last six years titled "The Free 
Economy and the Strong State: The Politics of Thatcherism" by Andrew Gamble. 
Pace our conservative-minded pundits, this is not the American way. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, it may not be the British way much longer. Despite 
Thatcher's own ambition to go "on and on," Young argues that in fact her era 
has come and gone. The most revisionist thesis of all holds that Thatcher's 
place in the history books is gloriously secure, but that it also is time for 
Britain to look elsewhere for leadership.

Wolfgang Petersen's The Neverending Story (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is a 
shimmering, glorious adventure, a beguiling enchantment with a revolutionary 
message: The most important world is the inner one. It is the fortress of our 
dreams and hopes and can be reached only through books. That interior world (a 
real kingdom, called Fantasia in the film) is "all we have to set against 
reality." The hero of this 1984 film is a solemn 10-year-old (Barret Oliver) 
who has just lost his mother and who under suspiciously magical circumstances 
comes into the possession of an amazing book, "The Neverending Story," which 
draws him -- and us -- into high adventure. 
</P>
<P>
The Return of Sam McCloud (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, finds Dennis 
Weaver's maverick marshal now a senator caught up in a fight to protect the 
environment against chemical pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Manhunt: The Search for the Night Stalker (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new 
TV movie, tells of two Los Angeles police detectives leading the search for 
serial killer Richard Ramirez. Richard Jordan and A. Martinez star. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 release Iron Eagle (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) achieves a kind of 
perfection of preposterous awfulness that only earnest effort can produce. 
Jason Gedrick plays the adoring 18-year-old son of a jet-fighter pilot who's 
shot down and taken prisoner by a fictional Middle Eastern country -- read 
Libya -- while on a routine reconnaissance mission. When our government 
hesitates to intervene, Gedrick takes matters into his own hands with the help 
of a crusty retired Air Force colonel (Louis Gossett Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Extremities (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) was a stage triumph for Farrah 
Fawcett, but on screen it seems morbid and contrived as rape victim Fawcett 
manages to turn tables on her attacker (James Russo). 
</P>
<P>
Cast the First Stone (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, is also about the 
victim of rape, in this instance, a school teacher and former Catholic novice 
(Jill Eikenberry) who is raped and left pregnant by a hitchhiker. 
</P>
<P>
Blade Runner (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) takes place in the used-up future: 
Los Angeles 2019, a dense and ominous metropolis. Director Ridley Scott has 
made a sensational-looking film that combines film noir and sci-fi to probe a 
highly dangerous world in which it's hard to tell who's human and who's a 
replicant, a robot that turns deadly when it becomes defective. One who can 
tell the difference is ex-cop bounty hunter Harrison Ford. But that's all there 
is to it, and the film is pretty hollow, great as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
The Godfather, Francis Coppola's glorious gangster epic from the Mario Puzo 
novel, is back on Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the conclusion airing 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Milos Forman's film of Ken Kesey's mental asylum tragicomedy One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) strains credibility at the climax 
-- why don't the guys cut out when they get a chance? -- but Jack Nicholson and 
Louise Fletcher (Oscar winners both) are memorable as the ribald, cagey inmate 
and the calmly but determinedly destructive nurse he dares to defy. 
</P>
<P>
Predator (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is familiar, mindless macho fare with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger cast as a killing machine, heading a military rescue unit 
in the jungle of a nameless Latin American country and coming up against an 
evil alien. 
</P>
<P>
In Walter Hill's smart, rambunctious 48 HRS. (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), 
Eddie Murphy made his smash 1982 film debut as a slick con man on a two-day 
leave to help San Francisco police detective Nick Nolte nail one of Murphy's 
cohorts. Fun but ultra-violent. 
</P>
<P>
The whimsical and poignant Back to the Future (NBC Friday at 8 p.m.) finds 
small-town youth Michael J. Fox accidentally sent back 30 years, where, to his 
chagrin, he discovers that his mother is crazy about him rather than his own 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 28 will premiere two foreign films Friday, Letters From the Park (at9 
p.m.) and Massey Sahib (at 11 p.m.), neither of which has had a theatrical 
release. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at 10 p.m., Channel 28 will present Harold Lloyd's classic Safety 
Last.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CHIC SAVAGES BY JOHN FAIRCHILD (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: 
$19.95; 215 PP.)

One rainy Monday morning during the Reagan era, John Fairchild, publisher of 
Women's Wear Daily and W, had a doleful thought: "There's been a big change in 
society; today it's all money and power and greed." His response was typical. 
Having spotted a trend, he gave the Donald Trumps and their ilk a label, 
"Nouvelle Society," and soon exulted: "Before we knew it, people were secretly 
-- and not so secretly -- labeling their friends. It's moments like these that 
make it all worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
"It," for Fairchild, has been a life of hobnobbing with and reporting on the 
rich and famous. His grandfather founded Women's Wear Daily, and in 1949, at 
age 20, Fairchild was sent to Paris to study French and fashion. It paid off. 
These days, when he wants to heal the lacerations of infighting with the "chic 
savages" of Manhattan, Milan and Tokyo, he repairs to his chalet in Switzerland 
or his 17th-Century villa in the south of France. He devotes a whole chapter to 
describing the taste and refinement of these hideaways, as if to say: The best 
justification, even for silliness, is living well. 
</P>
<P>
In this memoir-cum-expose, Fairchild hardly bites the hand that feeds him; he 
gums the knuckles in what ends up as half a kiss. Breezily, he tells us how 
designers, from Dior and Balenciaga to Armani and Blass, have become bigger 
celebrities than their customers; what fashion journalists do; why Paris 
couture is endangered; how the Nouvelles are displacing New York's Wobbly 
Wasps; how social climbing is like a child's game of "snakes and ladders"; what 
the flower bill was for the wedding of financier Saul Steinberg's daughter ($1 
million); what Barbara Bush is like (nice); and a thousand other details about 
who's In and Out, what things look like and what they cost. 
</P>
<P>
Shallow, sure. But Fairchild braces his Italian shoes on one bedrock fact: 
Fashion is important. Not just because people have "a romantic idea that the 
rich and powerful have something special to offer," but because the mysterious 
process that makes the same thing or idea in turn radically new, comfortably 
mainstream, hopelessly passe and, sometimes, new again fuels entire economies. 
Evidently a charming man, Fairchild can tell jokes at his own expense. He takes 
no responsibility for the coarsening of society but regrets it, if only by 
reflex. He tries to persuade us that, as a non-billionaire and a member of the 
working press, he's just plain folks. And he worries now and then about 
"falling into the same pit of emptiness" as his subjects before reverting to 
the magazine formula: Spot trends, spot people, label them and move on. Michael 
Harris

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: MARC BLOCH: A LIFE IN HISTORY BY CAROLE FINK (CAMBRIDGE 
UNIVERSITY PRESS: $27.95; 346 PP.)

Marc Bloch, one of this century's most important historians, is in many ways an 
ideal subject for a student of contemporary Europe, as his life spans the 
period of French history from the Dreyfus Affair to the Holocaust. In this 
clearly written book, Carole Fink has thoroughly documented Bloch's fervor for 
history, his deep devotion to France and his courage as a patriot. 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the effects of the deeply emotional Dreyfus Affair on French 
historians, Bloch came to believe that the facts of history were in essence 
psychological facts. In his most famous book, "The Historian's Craft," he 
writes that the historian is like the ogre in the fairy tales: Where he smells 
human blood, he knows his quarry is at hand. Likening the historian to the 
biologist who has a fine microscope but no idea what to study with it, Bloch 
(who together with Lucien Febvre founded the influential Annales journal) 
developed a comparative method by which historical testimonies and evidence 
could be judged and their distortions, deceits and errors understood. During 
the First World War, he set out to collect the testimony of men on the front, 
and had to crawl back under a hail of German rifle fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fink's account clearly etches Bloch's efforts to render comprehensible the 
turbulent events of his time and to root his accounts of medieval Europe in an 
understanding of the present. Typically, the last courses Bloch taught in Paris 
in 1942 were on the economic evolution of the United States as well as on the 
peasantry and seigneury in France in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the Rockefeller Foundation and the New School for Social 
Research tried to offer Bloch passage out of Europe, but in the end he decided 
to stay in France with his aged mother, whose visa could not be procured in 
time. In the most moving chapter of the book, Fink recounts how Bloch, exiled 
from Paris to Lyon, rose to the highest ranks of the Resistance before he was 
arrested and shot in 1944. Bloch, Fink sums up, was "a rationalist keenly aware 
of the power and ubiquitousness of irrational forces." Benjamin Kilborne

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: SPRINKLED WITH RUBY DUST BY H.N. SWANSON (WARNER BOOKS: 
$16.95; 151 PP.)

There is wonderfully evocative writing in this autobiography of the legendary 
Hollywood literary agent who represented F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, 
Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain and the mysterious Cornell Woolrich (the most 
noir of the noir writers, upon whose story "Rear Window" was based). 
Unfortunately, little of it is in the body of the book. The best stuff is in 
the introduction by a more recent Swanson client, Elmore Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"(O)ne morning in mid-September, the phone rang and I spoke to H.N. Swanson for 
the first time," writes Leonard, who started his career writing western novels. 
"He asked if I had actually written this offbeat novel about a guy named Jack 
Ryan -- surprised, I suppose, because it wasn't a Western. I convinced him that 
I was the author, and Swanie's next line was one I will remember for as long as 
I live: 'Well, kiddo, I'm going to make you rich.' " 
</P>
<P>
What follows is an easy-to-read, but all too polite, narrative by Swanson that 
begins in a small Iowa town with a boy who loved to read and who dreamed of 
being a writer. Because his family was poor, Swanson began at a young age to 
devise ways of making money, and eventually he forged business relationships 
with famed writers. Fresh out of college, he took his first trip to New York 
and convinced Robert Benchley, Alexander Woolcott, Gilbert Seldes and even 
Fitzgerald to write pieces for "College Humor," a magazine he founded. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood stories Swanson tells are amusing but not surprising. There has 
been plenty written elsewhere about Harry Cohen's crudeness and F. Scott 
Fitzgerald's drinking, for example. One detailed account of a marathon 
negotiation could have told us more about behind-the-scenes Hollywood than a 
dozen of his celebrity anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
There are precious few moments in this slim volume when the "Swanie" of the 
introduction comes shining through. Near the end of the book he writes, "My 
advice to writers is don't die. But if you do, don't give up hope." It's the 
kind of line Leonard would be proud to give a character. David Colker

HIDDEN HYPOCRISY IN A VERMONT IDYLL; 
</P>
<P>
A STRANGER IN THE KINGDOM BY FRANK HOWARD MOSHER (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95; 456 PP.; 
0-385-2440-2)

<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in Vermont in the summer of 1952, 13-year-old James Kinneson's major 
concerns are trout fishing, baseball and whether or not he will grow an inch or 
two taller before school reopens in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
James' village of Kingdom Gool, so remote that he and his father, Charles, 
frequently drive for miles to the highest ridge in order to pick up the Boston 
Red Sox game on the car radio, is typical rural Americana. 
</P>
<P>
The small farms and weathered barns, the kind seen on wish-you-were-here 
picture postcards, appear serene and stable, a reassuring contrast to the havoc 
unfolding in Washington where Joseph McCarthy is about the business of 
destroying lives and careers. The senator's mission, among the sorriest in 
American political history, has cast a pall over the nation, but with the 
exception of James' father, the crusty editor of the town's newspaper, the 
events touch the inhabitants of Kingdom County not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Like most small and insular places, the town has its share of peculiar 
personalities: the dog-cart man -- an itinerant deaf-mute artist who appears 
mysteriously every summer to restore the outdoor paintings destroyed by the 
harsh New England winter. Under his hand, brilliant colored fish, cows and 
other figures spring to life on the sides of the weathered barns, the old 
bridge, a town monument and the wall of the quarry. When his work is finished, 
the artist -- with his six dogs and supply cart -- disappears as mysteriously 
as he had come. 
</P>
<P>
There are peculiar names: Replacement Mari, the young girl left by the Gypsies 
in gratitude to Charles Kinneson's widowed grandfather; Welcome and Resolved, 
sons of Replacement Mari, cousins of James and Charles and an embarrassment to 
the entire town because of their slovenly ways and petty outlaw activities. 
</P>
<P>
And there are peculiar habits, as Jimmy relates: "My father and my older 
brother, Charlie, couldn't say two words to each other without getting into an 
argument. In and of itself, I don't suppose that their quarreling was so very 
unusual . . . what distinguished Kinneson-family arguments from most others is 
that once they got up a head of steam, Dad and Charlie refused to speak to each 
other directly. Instead they conducted their running verbal battles through the 
nearest available third person, who, more frequently than not, turned out to be 
me. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Your father and brother agree to disagree, that's all,' my mother told me a 
hundred times. 'Every family has its little peculiarities, Jimmy. Arguing is 
just the Kinnesons' special way of visiting with each other, I suppose.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are further degrees of dissension. Between families, within families, 
between friends, among the church members, and within the casual network of 
old-boy politicians that pass for power in the town 
</P>
<P>
So even the dog-cart man's artistry cannot disguise the moral rot that comes to 
light when the Rev. Walter Andrews and his teen-aged son, Nathan, arrive in 
Kingdom County. They have come in response to an inquiry from the congregation 
that had been without a pastor for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Andrews is Canadian-born, a former RCAF officer, a handsome athlete, and 
black. 
</P>
<P>
His presence is a revelation. Young James is amazed that the minister's speech 
is so well modulated, "Not like Amos 'n' Andy or Rochester at all." And he is 
surprised at the gradation of skin tone between the man and his son, having 
assumed all his young life that all black persons were of the same complexion. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Andrews takes over the church duties, institutes new programs and revives 
flagging attendance. He also begins to research the history of Pliny Templeton, 
a slave who had escaped to Vermont in 1860 via the Underground Railway and who 
founded the town's first academy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Andrews fits easily into his pastoral duties, he remains a stranger in 
the kingdom, and to some of the inhabitants, his color and confidence are more 
than an irritant. 
</P>
<P>
The town's false sense of serenity is further displaced when Claire LaRiviere, 
a girl of 17, arrives in response to an ad placed by Resolved Kinneson. The ad 
is misleading. Claire assumes she will be working for him as a housekeeper. 
Resolved -- filthy, unkempt and a chronic alcoholic -- has other plans for her. 
Horrified at the situation in which she finds herself, she flees to the 
parsonage. Resolved, vowing revenge, tracks her down but is challenged by 
Andrews. This triggers a confrontation with the town's ineffectual policeman, 
who demonstrates his own peculiar idea of maintaining law and order. What 
Resolved and the policeman cannot effect by force and intimidation soon is 
accomplished by rumor and innuendo, and the townspeople are divided by the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Then Claire disappears. When her horribly mutilated body is found, emotions 
fueled by latent bigotry boil up like lava through the cracks in a mountain. 
The minister immediately is charged with the murder, and Charles Kinneson Jr. 
steps forward to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
The trial ends in a most surprising and grisly climax, but not before revealing 
more about the inhabitants of Kingdom County than about the accused. Jealousy, 
rage, hatred and hypocrisy come to light. There is legal chicanery, cover-ups 
and outright lies. But there also is a rock-hard integrity, a deep sense of 
loyalty based on enduring friendship, and a dogged willingness to find the 
truth in the most unlikely places. 
</P>
<P>
In this fine novel, Frank Howard Mosher focuses an unerring eye on people 
caught in a web of fear and suspicion and develops them into whole persons 
capable of evoking sympathy and understanding. He avoids constructing 
larger-than-life heroes and avoids reducing the villains to stereotypical, 
bumbling bigots. Even Resolved, repulsive and evil-looking though he may be, 
exhibits on more than one occasion comic glimmers of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
Mosher, a Guggenheim Fellow and recipient of the National Endowment for the 
Arts Fellowship in Fiction, has given us a story of power and suspense that was 
a pleasure to read.

By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald Petievich is a longtime Secret Service agent who has written about law 
enforcement from the inside, perhaps most famously in "To Live and Die in L.A." 
In his new book, Earth Angels (New American Library: $17.95; 248 pp.), 
Petievich pits a kind of commando unit from the LAPD against an East L.A. gang. 
</P>
<P>
The principal antagonists are Jose Stepanovich, a detective-sergeant who heads 
the small squad, and Payaso Estrada, a member of the White Fence gang, wounded 
in a drive-by shooting at a wedding. 
</P>
<P>
You have the feeling that Petievich has it all absolutely right, including the 
frustrations that lead good cops to step just outside the law to get results, 
and on the other side, the frustrations and the feeling of isolation from the 
larger community that sustain the gangs as a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
There are elements as well of political cynicism and betrayal, and the torn 
loyalties where the Anglo and Latino worlds rub together. It's a bloody book, 
and a bloody good one, a holding narrative that also has the force of further 
revelation about a milieu you'd have said you knew from the newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Crais, a Los Angeles television story editor and writer, won several 
honors with his first novel, "The Monkey's Raincoat," featuring private eye 
Elvis Cole. (It will date us all to learn that Cole was named for his mother's 
idol.) 
</P>
<P>
In his second outing, Stalking the Angel (Bantam: $16.95; 240 pp.), Cole is 
asked to find an ancient and valuable Japanese manuscript on the samurai code 
of conduct. It has been stolen from a rich Los Angeles businessman who does a 
lot of trade with the Orient. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who is doing headstands in his office when first observed, is positioned 
almost midway between the wisecracking Spenser and the compassionate Lew Archer 
on the patented Private Eye Scale. 
</P>
<P>
Honoring tradition, Crais' first-person narrative moves quickly along mean 
streets, some of which are in Little Tokyo and populated by visiting yakusa, 
the well-known Japanese gangsters. The businessman's dazed and neglected 
daughter is in this up to her tank top, and there is a climactic tableau of 
carnage up at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Craig breaks no new ground but he does the familiar very well. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Solomita is a former New York cab driver, which is a perfect way to get 
to know the mean streets, as he indicated in a first novel, "The Twist of the 
Knife," featuring a world-worn Manhattan detective named Stanley Moodrow. 
Moodrow is back in Force of Nature (G. P. Putnam's Sons: $17.95; 320 pp.), 
another wonderfully atmospheric and characterful novel. 
</P>
<P>
Moodrow and a new partner are after a multiple killer whose identity is only 
too well known but who can't be found. He is a malevolently clever and 
psychopathic crack addict and dealer who calls himself Kubla Khan but is known 
to be Levander Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
Black villains are not common in crime fiction, and Solomita surrounds 
Greenwood with a sympathetic wife and children (whom Moodrow befriends and 
protects) to establish a balance. And, indeed, Solomita creates another 
balancing character, a soiled white cop who is one of Moodrow's colleagues. 
Killer and cop are products of circumstance, too hateful to be sympathetic but 
too comprehensible to be evil incarnate. Solomita knows his city and his 
people, and he writes with both muscle and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
So does the veteran Lawrence Block, whose private eye Matthew Scudder last 
appeared in "When the Sacred Ginmill Closes" a couple of years ago. Scudder is 
back in Out on the Cutting Edge (William Morrow: $17.95; 260 pp.), trying to 
find a young woman from the Midwest who'd come to New York with aspirations to 
act and who has now disappeared from her rooming house. 
</P>
<P>
What gives a particular savor to the new book is that Scudder, established in 
early works as a two-fisted, hollow-legged drinker, has nearly drunk himself to 
death and is now deeply involved in Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
So is Dave Robicheaux in James Lee Burke's books. It is a new sub-theme in 
crime fiction and a welcome change from the mandatory bottle of rotgut in the 
bottom drawer. As a fictional theme, the fight for sobriety creates an 
additional suspense: Can Scudder handle the crisis without lapsing or caving 
in? 
</P>
<P>
An AA buddy seems to have hanged himself, thus propelling Scudder further into 
a plot that has a genuinely surprising, and affecting, denouement. Scudder has 
written about 37 novels and two short-story collections but shows no signs 
whatever of going stale: exactly the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The no-less-staggeringly prolific Ruth Rendell -- about 33 novels under two 
names plus five collections of short stories, all since 1964 -- is back again 
with The Bridesmaid (Mysterious Press: $17.95; 259 pp.). It is another of her 
studies, tense and dark, of aberrational psychology, with the last horror, the 
terrible revelation, drawing nearer in a mixture of fear and fascination, like 
footsteps in the night. 
</P>
<P>
Rendell, who began as a journalist, seems to know every soiled antimacassar, 
every unkempt garden, every curtained window of suburban English life. Her 
detailing of household routines and family relationships is as convincing as 
her summoning of internal thoughts and feelings, banal or bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Her oddly chaste young protagonist, Philip, with his aversion to death and his 
near-obsessive liking for a back-yard statue of a nude woman, is ripe to be 
taken over by a kinky young actress named Senta. 
</P>
<P>
What is characteristic of Rendell is that the comical, or perhaps the 
ludicrous, is never too distant from the horror. Philip's quest for the statue, 
imprudently given away to his mother's suitor, is potentially farcical. But, 
like all else in Rendell's shrewd plotting, it reverberates down the days and 
weeks, helping to set up the events that are to be presumed beyond the last 
page. 
</P>
<P>
The late John D. MacDonald began his public life in pulp magazines, then 
appeared in paperback originals before his fame and following helped him 
graduate to hard cover. Now Otto Penzler's ever-thoughtful and useful 
Mysterious Press plans to bring out some of MacDonald's early paperback 
originals in hard cover. 
</P>
<P>
Key to the Suite (Mysterious Press: $17.95; 140 pp.) is one of those 
examinations of corporate life that MacDonald, who died in 1986, did so well. 
It was first published in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Hubbard is arriving at a convention to file a report that will lead to 
the firing of a senior executive who has not moved with the times. The mission 
is hardly a secret, and the executive's friends stage an elaborate plot to 
compromise Hubbard with a call girl. An ambitious, drunken young executive gets 
out of hand, and the caper backfires disastrously. 
</P>
<P>
In hardly more than novella length, MacDonald covered a lot of ground, sketched 
some potent if not deeply dimensioned characters, provided some sexual heat, 
commented satirically on the industrial convention as an American tribal rite 
and provided a lickety-split entertainment. Reading him again is to regret 
again that his typewriter has gone silent. 
</P>
<P>
Mystery writing, says Marie Smith, "is one area of human endeavor where women 
are not second-class citizens." She notes that the recent sale of rights to 
Agatha Christie's works for $93 million as fair proof that women write good 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Women, as I noted in a recent Endpapers, are more and more making their sleuths 
women, not men as they most often did in the past. Smith now has edited an 
anthology of mystery stories by women about women: Ms. Murder (Citadel Press: 
$8.95, paper; 274 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
The time-range is from a 1918 story, "The Lover of St Lys" by F. Tennyson 
Jesse, featuring Solange Fontaine, to "Three-Dot Po," by Sara Paretsky, 
featuring her Chicago private investigator, V. I. Warshawski. There is a 
familiar Jane Marple story by Agatha Christie, "Tape-Measure Murder." Antonia 
Fraser's Jemima Shore turns up in "The Case of the Parr Children," and Prof. 
Kate Fansler, the creation of Amanda Cross, tells the curious story of an 
infant who toddled out of some laurel bushes into the lives of a family, in a 
mystery not solved for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are a mixed bag, as collections always are, but they reveal what 
seems to have given women such a facility with crime fiction: a responsiveness 
to human emotions, a familiarity with the smallest details of daily living -- 
and sufficient frustrations to dream up wicked schemes of retribution.

Conventional critical wisdom usually divides the works of Naguib Mahfouz into 
four more or less distinct phases. The first of these, the historical phase, 
borrows its designation from the subject matter (ancient Egyptian history) of 
the historical trilogy that Mahfouz published between 1938-1945. The second 
spans the period 1945-1957 and is often defined in terms of the dominant 
literary technique in which Mahfouz then wrote; namely, social realism. The 
realistic novels of this period established Mahfouz as a major novelist in the 
Arab world. "The Beginning and the End" first published in Arabic in 1949) 
belongs to this phase and is widely representative of the novels of this 
period. The third phase (1959-1967) is sometimes defined in terms of subject 
matter as "existential" or "psychological" and sometimes in terms of narrative 
technique as "symbolic." To this phase belongs the second of our three novels: 
"The Thief and the Dogs" (originally published in 1961). The third novel under 
review, "Wedding Song," was published in 1981, and thus belongs to the fourth 
phase of Mahfouz's work. Although more than half of Mahfouz's 50-odd novels and 
collections of short stories belong to this phase, it has remained frozen under 
the nondescript chronological designation, "the post-1967 phase." The cause of 
this vagary does not lie entirely with the critics: The pace of change in 
Mahfouz's style, narrative technique, and general orientation since 1967 has 
been nothing short of frantic. No recognizable literary or intellectual pattern 
has emerged yet from the diverse works of this period. 
</P>
<P>
Questions of periodization aside, Mahfouz's art rests primarily on its powerful 
evocation of the social and psychological reality of that segment of Egyptian 
society with which he is intimately familiar: the Cairene petite bourgeoisie. 
Mahfouz undertakes this task of representation with a seemingly unshakable 
faith in the referential power of language and of contrived fictional 
structures to deliver reality. As a result, his novels often appear blissfully 
oblivious to the problematics of self-consciousness and singularly uninterested 
in theoretical questions about the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs or the 
transparency of writing strategies and literary devices. Therefore, readers 
weaned on the pervasive presence of these concerns in modernist and 
post-modernist writing will inevitably find Mahfouz's novels somewhat quaint, 
if not altogether passe. 
</P>
<P>
In structure and narrative technique, Mahfouz's fiction shows greater affinity 
with the main tradition of the Western novel than it does with the indigenous 
narrative forms prevalent in Arab culture. This is particularly true of the 
first three phases of his career. In part, this anomaly is the product of 
historical circumstances: The novel genre was borrowed into Arab culture from 
the West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although an impressive 
narrative tradition existed in Arabic (witness the "Arabian Nights") there were 
no Arabic novels in the Western sense of the term before 1913. (Mahfouz was 
born in 1911). It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Mahfouz and the 
pioneering Arab writers of his generation, should strive to emulate Western 
models of the genre even as they were acclimatizing it in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
To the inexorable pressures of historical urgency, however, one must add 
Mahfouz's personal aptitude: In his public pronouncements, Mahfouz makes no 
secret of his philosophical and intellectual identification with the secular 
outlook of modern Western civilization. Moreover, it is precisely because the 
novel has expressed more fully than any other literary genre the scientific and 
secular principles of this civilization that it has exercised such a formative 
influence on his imagination and literary sensibility. The preponderance of 
secular Western ideas in Mahfouz's fiction is therefore entirely consistent 
with his philosophical and artistic commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Hence a potential irony: In the works of this major Arab novelist one 
encounters the ideas of Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, and Freud more often than 
those of any Arab or Islamic thinker. In fact, the collective genius of 
Arab/Islamic civilization is invoked by reference and allusion in Emil Habiby's 
single novel, "The Pessoptimist," more than it is in all of Mahfouz's novels 
combined. The increasing recourse to indigenous and traditional forms of 
narrative and storytelling one detects in the works of younger Arab writers in 
Egypt (e.g. Jamal al-Ghaytani) and elsewhere in the Arab world may be a 
reaction against the excessive reliance of Mahfouz and his generation on 
Western fictional models. 
</P>
<P>
These unsettling contradictions notwithstanding, Mahfouz's supreme contribution 
to the art of the Arabic novel lies safely beyond doubt. In the long run, his 
cultivation of a functional literary Arabic prose capable of capturing the 
nuanced rhythms of daily life in a bustling metropolis may emerge as his 
greatest lasting contribution to this literary tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Perforce, much of the pleasure that accrues from reading Mahfouz's supple and 
perfectly controlled prose in Arabic will elude the reader of his novels in 
translation, no matter how adequate the translation. And the translation of the 
three novels under review is not only adequate but actually quite good. The 
flavor, however, is there, and it is well preserved in Mahfouz's tightly 
constructed plots with their neat closures, compelling psychological portrayals 
and lifelike characters whose genuine passions elevate them at the moment of 
death to a kind of heroic status that their humdrum petit-bourgeois existence 
had denied them in life. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three novels reviewed here, "The Beginning and the End" is perhaps the 
least complicated artistically. Cast in the traditional mold of realistic 
fiction, the novel is almost a case study in social stratification. The action 
is set in the late 1930s in Cairo and evolves around the futile struggle of the 
family of a minor government official to survive his untimely death. The 
economic and social hardships exercise different and uneven pressures on the 
various members of the family and severely circumscribe personal ambition to 
move up the social ladder. As is typical in Mahfouz, innate disposition 
conspires with acquired habit to motivate the characters of this novel to 
transgress against a reified social system that lashes back at them with deadly 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the events of the plot unfold in a uni-linear sequence of cause and 
effect, the novel contains a considerable amount of suspense and many turns and 
twists that never cease to fascinate us in realistic fiction. To help the 
reader disentangle these mysteries, the English translation uses a different 
font to distinguish the interior monologue and unvoiced thoughts of the 
characters from the narrative of the omniscient narrator. This technical device 
is used for the same purpose in the other two novels as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thief and the Dogs" is written in the tradition of the psychological or 
stream-of-consciousness novel. As in the normative examples of Western 
practitioners of the genre (e.g. Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf), concern with the 
internalized experience of characters takes precedence here over external 
reality, and interior monologue replaces omniscient narration and description. 
The few novels Mahfouz wrote in this style during the '60s announced the 
emergence of psychological realism in Arabic fiction. 
</P>
<P>
In contradistinction to the Western models that inspired these technical and 
stylistic innovations, however, Mahfouz's psychological novels retain in full 
their interest in political and social issues. In "The Thief and the Dogs" this 
interest survives in the motivation of the plot. A deluded idealist (an 
Egyptian Robin Hood of sorts,) seeks revenge from society for thwarting his 
ideals of justice and rewarding charlatanism. Upon release from prison, he 
takes the law into his own hands and wages a personal crusade against 
imposters. Instead of the intended culprits, however, his bullets claim only 
the lives of innocent by-standers before he himself is hunted down by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this novel political is the fact that the societal ills against 
which the contrived fictional action inveighs are directly referable to the 
culture of political opportunism cultivated and sanctioned by the regime. 
(Awareness of the constitutive relationship between the fictional action and 
its historical bases has led translators of other novels from this phase to 
append explanatory notes to the fictional text. Though admittedly cumbersome, 
this practice is not without merit in referential fiction.) 
</P>
<P>
In theme, structure, and style, "Wedding Song" reveals Mahfouz's post-1967 
groping for new approaches to the fast- changing social scene around him. This 
novel tells the story of a play: One of the characters in the novel recasts in 
dramatic form the actual life-stories of his parents and their close circle of 
associates -- all of whom are involved with the theater. The author disappears 
shortly after the play becomes a hit, but before the novel proper begins, thus 
leaving the characters (and readers) to figure out on their own such pressing 
questions as his authorial intention and the relation between lived and 
imaginatively rendered experience. 
</P>
<P>
While the withdrawal of the author from the text and the attempt to mix genres 
point in the direction of post-modernist writing, the appropriation of the idea 
and structure of "Hamlet" to the Egyptian context is a typical Mahfouzian move. 
On numerous occasions the characters draw an explicit analogy between their 
personal lapse into moral depravity and crime (prostitution, gambling, 
drug-dealing, etc.) and the large-scale economic and political corruption that 
accompanied the open-door policy of the late President Sadat. The time is the 
1970s, and this is Mahfouz's way of saying "something is rotten in the state of 
Egypt."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE CLOTHES HAVE NO EMPEROR: A CHRONICLE OF THE AMERICAN 
80S BY PAUL SLANSKY (FIRESIDE: $12.95, ILLUSTRATED)

<TEXT>
<P>
A caustically funny, profoundly depressing account of Reagan-era misstatements, 
errors, lies, scandals and deceptions -- leavened with the most egregious 
examples of contemporary film, television and rock music. Paul Slansky presents 
a vituperative portrait of government by facade: He argues (and offers 
substantial documentation) that behind a veneer of "old-fashioned values," 
corruption on a scale unprecedented in U. S. history was allowed to flourish 
under the ersatz leadership of a befuddled old actor who possessed only the 
sketchiest grasp of the facts and frequently confused reality with scenes from 
old movies. Perhaps the most damning aspect of Slansky's jeremiad is the 
lugubrious fact that the news media and the American people blithely accepted 
this fantasy regime. "The Clothes Have No Emperor" leads the reader to conclude 
that Cicero's famous condemnation of political malfeasance, "O tempore, o 
mores," was delivred 2,000 years too soon.

ENDPAPERS: TOM WOLFE'S LITERARY MANIFESTO: A RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Wolfe, the lionized author of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" (Farrar, Straus 
&amp; Giroux), whose still unpublished second novel recently commanded an 
advance estimated at $7 million, is not satisfied with amor y pesetas. He wants 
salud as well. He would be the bringer of health to a sick American literature. 
Alas, he cannot: Tom Wolfe is the disease of which he pretends to be the cure. 
</P>
<P>
In a "literary manifesto" just published in Harper's magazine, Wolfe begins 
with a diagnosis. Influential critics, he claims, have contaminated a 
generation of American novelists, luring them away from the practice of 
realistic fiction. Wolfe himself, already famous as a "new journalist," stood 
in wonder, he tells us, as the years of the '60s and '70s passed, and no 
novelist saw fit to exploit such irresistibly colorful and challenging subject 
matter. When he began "Bonfire," his novel of New York City in the '80s, Wolfe 
says, he still had the field of realistic fiction improbably to himself. 
Implicitly, he takes the success of that novel as proof of the correctness of 
his diagnosis. And his prescription, to be only slightly more plain about it 
than he is, is that other writers should write as he does. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe's manifesto makes, in literary criticism, the same mistake that his books 
"The Painted Word" and "From Bauhaus to Our House" made in art and architecture 
criticism, respectively. That mistake is what we might call the bright-student 
mistake. After reading a clever theory, the bright student finds evidence for 
it simply everywhere and becomes its champion, or else finds evidence against 
it everywhere and becomes its consecrated foe. Agreement is not decisive. 
Obsession is. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Painted Word" and "From Bauhaus to Our House" Wolfe finds evidence 
everywhere that artists and architects have taken art and architecture 
criticism as prescriptive. He disagrees with the prescription, but in the 
process he shows himself to be, more than any other American novelist with a 
comparable popular success to his credit, obsessed with critical opinion. He 
may assume a rollicking manner. He may wish to be the joker who calls the 
professorial bluff. But the smile is forced, the act unconvincing. As ever, not 
to philosophize is to philosophize. 
</P>
<P>
The professors who obsess Wolfe in the Harper's article, entitled "Stalking the 
Billion-Footed Beast," are George Steiner and the late Lionel Trilling. Their 
thesis, in his formulation, is that the realist novel "was the literary child 
of the nineteenth-century industrial bourgeoisie. . . . But now that the 
bourgeoisie was in a state of 'crisis and partial route' (Steiner's phrase) and 
the old class system was crumbling, the realistic novel was pointless. What 
could be more futile than a cross section of disintegrating fragments?" 
</P>
<P>
The toxic idea now in place, Dr. Wolfe (Ph.D., American Studies, Yale, 1957) 
sets out to discover whom it has intoxicated. He contrasts an older, still 
realist generation of writers to a younger, post-realist one. Thus, "Writers 
who had gone to college before 1960, such as Saul Bellow, Robert Stone, and 
John Updike, found it hard to give up realism, but many others were caught 
betwixt and between. They didn't know which way to turn. For example, Philip 
Roth. . . made a statement (in 1961) that had a terrific impact on other young 
writers. We now live in an age, he said, in which the imagination of the 
novelist lies helpless before what he knows he will read in tomorrow morning's 
newspaper. 'The actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture 
tosses up figures daily that are the envy of any novelist'." 
</P>
<P>
This paragraph is downright goofy. Robert Stone, whom Wolfe places in the older 
generation, is four years younger than Philip Roth, whom he places in the 
younger generation. Updike is Roth's senior by only two years. All three of 
these writers (along with Tom Wolfe himself, for that matter) were in college 
at the same time. It is nonsense to divide such near contemporaries into 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
Bellow is older, of course, but no writer had a greater influence on aspiring 
novelists in the '60s than he did. Roth's 1961 essay is reprinted in a volume 
entitled "Reading Myself and Others" which is dedicated to Bellow as "the other 
from whom I have learned most." Bellow's "Herzog" (has Wolfe forgotten?) was a 
critical and popular sensation in 1964. It was with that book, more than with 
any of his earlier ones, that the future Nobel Prize winner became what he 
would remain: the lord of the literary manor. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction crucial to Roth's 1961 essay was not between realism and 
post-realism but between the different realisms of private and public life. The 
retreat of serious American fiction into private life mirrored a similar, 
overwhelmed retreat on the part of much of the citizenry. But Roth's essay was 
anything but a manifesto against realism per se. After writing it, he went on 
to write three fully realistic novels, including "Portnoy's Complaint" (1969), 
the book that made him a household word. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting the '60s Bellow, misreading the '60s Roth, Wolfe singles out as the 
Zeitgeist incarnate Ronald Sukenick, the author of "Up" (1968). Sukenick, 
currently editor of American Book Review, deserves the thoughtful following 
that he continues to have; but he would be quick to laugh, I suspect, at the 
notion that his mode of fiction was sweeping the country in 1968. Some of the 
other formalist writers of the '60s and '70s may be better known than Sukenick; 
John Barth won a National Book Award in 1972. But it is ludicrous to suggest 
that these writers, rather than realist novelists like Roth and Bellow, defined 
the literary mood of those decades. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, casting himself as the defender of realism, mentions John le Carre and 
Joseph Wambaugh as "writers whom literary people customarily dismiss." But 
literary people do not customarily dismiss them. Wambaugh has been warmly 
praised in the Los Angeles Times by John Sutherland, a British critic teaching 
at Caltech and contributing regularly to the Times Literary Supplement -- in 
short, by just the sort of transatlantic intellectual from whom, on Wolfe's 
reading of things, the worst might have been expected. As for Le Carre, he is 
reviewed, again and again, with a tender deference before which the 
often-savaged John Updike must stand in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Let us even concede, for the sake of Wolfe's argument, that writers like 
Wambaugh and Le Carre are "customarily dismissed." Wolfe's thesis still 
collapses, for its claim is that the influence of academic criticism has been 
so great that writers of talent have been dissuaded from mining the realist 
vein at all. If Wambaugh and Le Carre (British but with a huge American 
readership) are on hand even for the dismissal, academic criticism cannot have 
done the harm Wolfe claims it has done. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe uses, as a part of his manifesto, a long speech by a character in his 
novel who cries, of New York, "It's the Third World out there!" It is indeed, 
but realistic fiction about the Third World in the First has been written by 
one British or American novelist after another. Wolfe ignores the work of 
Jonathan Franzen, Marianne Wiggins, Bharati Mukherjee and a long list of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
More strikingly, he also ignores, or distorts, the work of John Irving, whom he 
mentions only once: "John Gardner and John Irving both started out in this 
(neo-fabulist) vein." Perhaps; but if so, Irving -- like Wolfe, a professed 
neo-Dickensian -- quickly changed veins. Irving's novels are populous, 
multi-generational, socioeconomically various, unabashedly sentimental 
blockbusters. Like Dickens, he often makes a child (in "The Cider House Rules," 
an orphan) his central character. In short, his is just the terrain that Wolfe 
claims to have found a literary Empty Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And the list does not thin out at all quickly after Irving. Pat Conroy, E. L. 
Doctorow, Anne Tyler, Carolyn See -- the entries are numerous and interesting. 
Writers like these are quintessentially American: warm-hearted, easy-to-like 
and with something to say -- nothing, perhaps, as richly pondered as might have 
been forthcoming from a Thomas Mann, but something, all the same. Among 
literary possibilities, the one they enact is very like the one that Americans 
enact as people. Reading them is like spotting an American in a foreign city. 
Not everyone cares for that style (or for us); but for better or worse, it is 
our style, the unmistakable native manner. To have missed it, and Wolfe misses 
it completely, is to have missed the American literary reality. 
</P>
<P>
A writer who demonizes criticism as Wolfe does cannot be too fussy about the 
border between popular and serious writing. After all, the critics are the ones 
who police that border. This said, I find it instructive to compare him to 
another writer whom critics do indeed customarily dismiss but who, like him, 
has taken New York as her subject and, like him, has made a fabulous income 
doing so. I write of Judith Krantz, whose most recent best seller was "I'll 
Take Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
Like Wolfe, Krantz has a background in journalism. Like him, she has a lively 
interest in fashion. She wrote, in her journalistic years, for McCall's and 
Cosmopolitan. Like him, she does her homework. Wolfe admires Zola for going 
into an actual mine to do research for his novel "Germinal." Krantz, for her 
novel "Scruples" drew on a lifetime of contact with fashion retailers. "I'm a 
stickler for detail," she once told the Washington Post; "I don't know anybody 
doing the so-called commercial fiction researches as thoroughly as I do." Like 
him, she takes sex, class and power as her subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Krantz, like Wolfe, revels in the brand name as telling detail, 
which is to say, of course, in the telling detail that tells you nothing unless 
you already know. At one point in his manifesto, Wolfe mentions Scully &amp; 
Scully address books. If you've never heard of Scully &amp; Scully address 
books or don't know how they differ from other kinds of address book, well, 
help yourself to another Bud Light. 
</P>
<P>
In a passage on writers whom he chooses to call "K-Mart Realists," Wolfe 
summons up the memory of the late Raymond Carver in every way but by mentioning 
his name, mocking this widely admired writer's style and sneering at his 
settings ("Rustic Septic Tank Rural"). As it happens, however, in places like 
Klatskanie, Ore., where Carver was born, and Port Angeles, Wash., where he 
died, rusty (did Wolfe really intend the redundant "rustic"?) septic tanks are 
what they use, and K-Mart is where they shop. Inconveniently for our literary 
manifestant, none of this is less real than Scully &amp; Scully address books. 
It is simply less luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
Here we come to the heart of the matter. After criticism, what Tom Wolfe is 
obsessed with is luxury. He's not the first. He won't be the last. The joy of 
goods, the mirth of merchandise, is the subtext in all his books just as it is 
in those of Judith Krantz. The difference between them is that while Judy 
laughs all the way to the bank, Tom, on the same trip, preaches.

FAMILY LAW; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA BENCH, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE 
THE BYRNE DYNASTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM DAWSON, Adam Dawson of Santa Monica has covered the Los Angeles 
judicial system for eight years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MORE THAN 100 YEARS ago, Irish nationalist Peter Christopher Byrne left his 
homeland for North America. According to disputed family legend, he settled 
first in Canada, then moved to Alton, Ill. -- one step ahead of authorities who 
wanted to question him about a cache of weapons in his basement, weapons they 
believed were bound for Ireland. If the story is true, it may have been the 
last time a Byrne was on the wrong side of the law. What's undisputed is Peter 
Christopher's quiet legacy: His grandchildren left the family's traditional 
railroad jobs and became judges, lawyers, court clerks, bailiffs and probation 
officers, forming California's first family of law. 
</P>
<P>
One of Peter Christopher's grandsons, William M. (Bill) Byrne, became a 
California legislator, a Municipal Court judge and a Superior Court judge and, 
for 24 years, served as a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles. His stint 
on the federal bench earned him the family nickname "Federal Bill," because 
even members of the Byrne clan need a little help telling their judges apart. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Bill's son, Matt Byrne, joined his father on the federal bench in 1971 
and is perhaps best known for revealing government misconduct and dismissing 
all the charges in the Pentagon Papers case in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
One of Federal Bill's nephews, William E. Byrne, retired from the El Dorado 
County Superior Court three years ago. Dubbed "Placerville Bill," he now is in 
private practice in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
One of Federal Bill's brothers, James T. Byrne, the only Republican in the 
bunch, served as a Los Angeles Municipal Court commissioner from 1962 until 
1974. His son, J. Michael Byrne, left the Los Angeles district attorney's 
office when he became a municipal judge in 1982. Last year, he won election to 
the Los Angeles Superior Court, where he is one of 238 judges supervised by -- 
you guessed it -- his second cousin, presiding judge Richard (Skip) Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
In all, six Byrnes have been federal or state judges or commissioners, and 
three sit on the bench today in Los Angeles. "They are throwbacks," Alan 
Rothenberg, president of the State Bar of California, says of the Byrnes. "They 
believe in old-fashioned public service." 
</P>
<P>
Or as U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian puts it: "It must be in the genes. 
Some people are born great artists, others great musicians. This must be 
something passed down through the generations." 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL BILL WAS ONE OF eight children of John Byrne, a railroad fireman who 
settled in Oakland in the late 1800s. Shortly after the turn of the century, a 
wildcat strike against the railroad cost John his job, but it left him with 
plenty of time to hang out in Oakland, where, as another family legend has it, 
he became a drinking partner of author Jack London. John's unemployment and the 
hard times left their mark on the next generation of Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
"With my father (James) and his generation, there was a lot of fear of seeing 
the poverty he grew up in and not wanting to go back to that," says J. Michael 
Byrne, 46. Thus the lure of public service: It was steady, dependable work for 
relatively decent pay, open to those with little formal education. 
</P>
<P>
A dropout before reaching high school, Federal Bill became a promising 
lightweight boxer, then worked as a pool-hall owner, a railroad fireman, a 
union leader and a state legislator before turning to law. "For him and others 
like him, there really weren't any great opportunities for advancement other 
than by going into public service," explains his son, Matt, 59. "Public service 
did afford an opportunity to play a more significant role in society." 
</P>
<P>
While serving in the California Assembly, Federal Bill attended night courses 
at Loyola Law School, graduating in 1929. He spent 12 years in private 
practice, then served on the Municipal and Superior courts before President 
Harry S. Truman tapped him for the federal bench in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a reputation for being a rather stern man on the bench," says U.S. 
District Judge Harry L. Hupp, who tried his first federal case before Federal 
Bill. "Both the prosecutor and I were rookies," Hupp recalls. But instead of 
getting the lectures and sarcasm they expected, they found the judge a willing 
teacher. "He took a fatherly interest in us neophytes -- calling us up to the 
bench to let us know if we were doing the right thing and what we were doing 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Bill did much the same for members of his extended family. "He was a 
strong figure," says J. Michael, describing his uncle as the family mentor. "At 
family gatherings, he would discuss with you your career, political 
affiliations and life as much as your own father." 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes his concern could be overbearing. For instance, when J. Michael 
and a friend announced in 1965 their plan to spend the summer registering black 
voters in Alabama, his own father reluctantly agreed. But the friend's father 
took his objections to a higher court -- Federal Bill. A fierce argument ensued 
as the judge forbade his nephew to go. "He was afraid I would be arrested, and 
it (the criminal record) would follow me around for the rest of my life," J. 
Michael explains. "We went anyway." 
</P>
<P>
BY THE TIME MATT BYRNE joined his father on the federal bench in 1971, his 
father had been a federal judge for 21 years. A former U.S. attorney and 
successful trial lawyer who had served as executive director of the President's 
Commission on Campus Unrest, Matt became the youngest federal judge in the 
country at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is considered one of the smartest -- and perhaps most frustrated -- 
judges in Los Angeles federal court. With his reading glasses perched low on 
his nose, Matt often shrugs broadly and tells attorneys: "Well, if that's the 
way you want to try your case" -- leaving them wondering what they are doing 
wrong. He also chastises prosecutors by saying: "That's not the way we did 
things when I was U.S. attorney." 
</P>
<P>
"The camaraderie of the trial of a lawsuit is a great intellectual exercise for 
both the lawyers and the judge, but it may be more fun for the lawyers," says 
Matt, a bachelor who is a big Dodgers fan and friend of team owner Peter 
O'Malley and manager Tommy Lasorda. Despite Matt's occasional look of 
indifference, which he says is necessary to avoid showing his feelings, he 
acknowledges that he enjoys the give-and-take with attorneys. Those exchanges, 
frequently laced with humor and sarcasm, can provide an educational but painful 
lesson for some attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the sharpest judge in federal court, but he may be the most bored," says 
one former federal prosecutor. "He'd like to be in a courtroom where Clarence 
Darrow and F. Lee Bailey are slugging it out. Instead, it's just us." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some lawyers say, Matt is all too ready to jump in and question 
witnesses. "That's the hardest thing for a judge not to do, especially someone 
who was a trial lawyer," Tevrizian says. "It's like taking a kid to a candy 
store and saying, 'You can't have any.' " Others, such as Assistant U.S. 
Attorney George Wu, say Matt questions witnesses only when a lawyer has failed 
to elicit key information that the judge wants. "What's wrong with that?" Wu 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has handled hundreds of trials, Matt is perhaps best remembered for 
the Pentagon Papers case. During the Vietnam War, two RAND Corp. researchers, 
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo, were charged with stealing and 
distributing copies of a classified study of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia 
-- the so-called Pentagon Papers. Matt dismissed the charges in the midst of 
the highly publicized trial after learning of secret government wiretaps and a 
White House-directed and CIA-aided break-in at the office of Ellsberg's 
psychiatrist in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The bizarre events had incurably infected the prosecution of the case," he 
said in dismissing the charges. The government's actions, he continued, "offend 
a sense of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks before dismissing the case, Matt revealed, he had met twice with 
President Richard M. Nixon's domestic adviser, John D. Ehrlichman. The first 
meeting, at Nixon's San Clemente retreat, was to ask about Matt's interest in 
running the FBI. Two days later, the pair met in Santa Monica. The judge again 
told Ehrlichman that he could not consider the FBI post until the Pentagon 
Papers case was over. At the time, some people wondered if the Nixon 
Administration was seeking to influence the criminal case by making the job 
offer. If so, the ploy backfired. Matt not only revealed the meetings but also 
disclosed the secret wiretaps and the Ellsberg break-in, all in spite of the 
prosecution's objections. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not afraid to come down as hard on the government as he is on the 
defense," says Los Angeles defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier. "He lets the 
chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
WITHOUT THE UNIFYING influence of Federal Bill, who died at age 77 in 1974, the 
Byrne clan gatherings are now largely limited to weddings and funerals. Each of 
Peter Christopher Byrne's grandsons and great-grandsons is now the center of 
his own family. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Byrne, for instance, left Los Angeles to work in the Sacramento 
district attorney's office. "I thought it would be fun to practice in an area 
where people didn't know how to spell my last name," he says. But the family 
tug eventually drew him back to Los Angeles. He is married to Guillermina 
Gutierrez Byrne, a research attorney with the California Court of Appeal. Among 
her brothers are Gabriel Gutierrez, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, and 
Ventura Municipal Judge Art Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael was appointed to the Rio Hondo Municipal Court in 1982 after nine 
years as a deputy district attorney. Last year, he ran for and won a seat on 
the Los Angeles Superior Court. He credits Federal Bill with setting the 
example for the rest of the clan. "The respect Bill had from the rest of us -- 
that's, I think, what made a lot of us lean toward the law," he says. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Byrne, J. Michael's 60-year-old first cousin, also found Federal 
Bill a willing adviser. Originally dubbed "Berkeley Bill" because of his 
parents' hometown, William frequently turned to his uncle for guidance. After 
graduating from law school, Berkeley Bill came south to discuss with Federal 
Bill where he should set up practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that if he had to do it over again, he'd do it in a place where he 
longed to live," Berkeley Bill recalls. So Berkeley Bill, an avid trout 
fisherman who liked gold rush country, established his practice in El Dorado. 
To the younger Byrnes, the move made him known as "Placerville Bill." 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, a seat on the El Dorado County Superior Court opened up, and Berkeley 
Bill again turned to Federal Bill. "He said, 'Go ahead and apply for it.' It 
would have been nice to wait five or six years, but maybe then the opportunity 
wouldn't be there." At 35, Berkeley Bill was the youngest person in the state 
to have been appointed to Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, he presided over a liability suit involving the 1964 Hell 
Hole Dam failure on the Middle Fork of the American River. American River 
Constructors closed the unfinished dam one winter, causing the structure to 
give way after heavy rains. Flooding was so severe that, 18 miles downriver, 
trout were washed 16 feet up into the trees. American River Constructors was 
found negligent in what Berkeley Bill refers to as his "most challenging case," 
one in which engineering experts from all over the world testified. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he resigned to join a Sacramento law firm. He now spends most of 
his time as a private judge -- sometimes known as a "rent-a-judge." He and 
other former judges have discovered that parties involved in lawsuits are often 
willing to pay for a private judge rather than wait years for a sitting judge 
to hear their cases. Berkeley Bill resigned from the bench because, he says, "I 
just decided it was long enough. I wanted a change." 
</P>
<P>
His second cousin, Skip Byrne, 56, envisions a similar change in three years, 
when he will have been on the Los Angeles Superior Court two decades. "I don't 
want to be tied down to being a judge for the rest of my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Skip's most notable case probably was the one in which he presided over the 
complex division of J. Paul Getty's $4-billion trust in 1985. He was praised by 
attorneys for the way he handled the fractious, 19-month case, but he is quick 
to return the compliment: "I felt that the lawyers could, and did, bring about 
some reconciliation of adverse family interests." 
</P>
<P>
He was named presiding judge of the Superior Court last year and so far has 
received favorable reviews in what many observers call a thankless task. "He's 
a good administrator who gets things done without sitting on your head," says 
Superior Court Judge Alexander H. Williams III. Despite opposition from the 
ranks, Skip implemented the so-called fast-track system in civil court. 
Mandated by state law, it is an experiment in eight counties requiring judges 
to aggressively manage their own court calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Since he became presiding judge, a position whose only real power is that of 
assigning his fellow judges to different courts, Skip also has instituted 
case-management seminars for the judges and has helped increase the use of 
computers to track cases through the legal system. It is a system in jeopardy, 
he believes -- largely because of a funding shortage. "The underfunding of the 
judiciary deprives judges of the time necessary to pay attention to matters 
brought before them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
With Berkeley Bill retiring and Skip thinking about doing the same, it might 
seem as though the Byrne dynasty is drawing to an end -- especially at a time 
when, Skip says, a crass new attitude prevails among many lawyers. 
"Traditionally, people went into law to help their fellow man," he says. "Now 
the law is much more of a business. . . . A lot of young lawyers just go into 
the law for the money." 
</P>
<P>
But Skip and his wife, Marguerite, have six children, ranging in age from 18 to 
30, and three of them have already graduated from law school with different 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Mark, a 30-year-old assistant U.S. attorney, says he is carrying on a "sense of 
wanting to do something for the community in general." Elizabeth, 27, was a 
lawyer with a downtown Los Angeles firm like her brother Matt, 26, before 
joining a New York-based auction house. She adds: "It is part of your greater 
obligation to give back to the community. In our family, you serve society 
through the law." 
</P>
<P>
So the family tradition continues. "Have you seen Skip's children?" asks Hupp. 
"The next generation is safe. There will be some Byrne judges there."

Morgan Creek Productions wants to corral all those "Young Guns" left standing 
after the climatic shoot-out for a sequel, currently titled "Hellbent for 
Leather." While Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko's characters 
all died, negotiations are under way to sign survivors Lou Diamond Phillips, 
Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland. Since production is scheduled to get 
under way in January, when weather could be a problem, location scouting is 
going on in Arizona and Texas as well as New Mexico, where the original film 
was shot. . . Arnold Kopelson and Keith Barish will produce "The Fugitive," a 
$30-million film version of the 20-year-old TV series for Warners. Production 
is four to six months off as rewrites of David N. Twohy's script are being 
done. Sources indicate that British director Stephen Frears ("Dangerous 
Liaisons") and actor Harrison Ford are among those being approached about the 
project. . . . Meanwhile, Twohy is writing "Aliens III" for Fox. . . .

William Hurt and Alec Baldwin have signed aboard Woody Allen's fall project for 
Orion. The film, which, as usual, is untitled, started filming last week. Woody 
has left himself out of the cast, but Mia Farrow is in. . . David Carradine 
stars as a preacher, and former porn star Tracy Lords plays the eldest of his 
five daughters in Eyefilm's "Prey, for the Wicked." Production on this dramatic 
thriller with religious overtones, written by John M. Bell and directed by Rick 
Eye, begins in January. Image will distribute. . . .

Lewis B. Chesler, executive producer and creator of pay-TV's "The Hitchhiker," 
has purchased film rights to 1963 Japanese novel, "The Lady Killer" by Masako 
Togawa, a highly controversial and erotic thriller that dealt with role of 
women in that society. Screenwriter Robert J. Avrech ("Body Double") will adapt 
the book, and Carl Schenkel ("The Mighty Quinn") will direct. "Crimson 
Cabaret," the title of the film version, will film in Japan and possibly Hong 
Kong this spring. . . . KIRK HONEYCUTT

Universal's got a lot riding on its big fall release "Back to the Future II" -- 
due out Nov. 22. The original "Back to the Future" (1985), you'll recall, 
grossed over $200 million domestically. So promo for "II" is already upon us: 
</P>
<P>
* Three impressive billboards -- two here, one in N.Y.C.'s Times Square -- are 
up, with giant digital clocks counting back the hours until the film opens. (It 
gets an early premiere Nov. 20 at the Universal City Cinemas to benefit Tripod, 
a nonprofit organization for hearing-impaired children.) 
</P>
<P>
* "BTTF II" digital desk clocks went out to the press back around Labor Day. 
Other promotional tie-ins on tap: Futuristic sunglasses for $1.99 with certain 
Pizza Hut orders; DeLorean car models (microsize $2.49, a radio-controlled car 
for $49.99 and a battery-operated, drivable one for $159) from Toys 'R' Us, 
which will also have T-shirts, baseball caps and a skateboard; and models of 
futuristic Texaco gas stations based on one seen in the film -- offered at 
Texaco stations, natch. 
</P>
<P>
* An official "Back to the Future" fan club, run by the same folks who operate 
the authorized Lucasfilm and "Star Trek" clubs. For $9.95, you get a magazine, 
logo patch, photo and stickers. 
</P>
<P>
* The novelization, with an initial print run of 400,000-plus copies, hit book 
stores late last month. Sue Martin

OUT OF A BACK YARD OF SOLID ROCK, A HOMEOWNER FASHIONS AN OLD-TIME CALIFORNIA 
GARDEN

Magazine.

THE SITE WAS promising, but the soil was not. Still, antiques dealer Richard 
Mouck had found the house he wanted. Craftsman in feel, if not in fact, it was 
perched on top of Goat Hill in Eagle Rock with a sweeping view and surrounded 
by several hundred feet of priceless arroyo boulder walls. But why had the 
previous owners not planted a thing? Why was most of the back yard barely 
covered with dry, weedy grasses? 
</P>
<P>
The answers lay just below the surface -- solid rock. According to neighbors, 
the few trees and shrubs on the property were planted in holes dynamited in the 
1920s by the original owner, a Los Angeles fireman who also built the stone 
walls, hauling the rocks up from the Los Angeles River in his old truck. 
Undaunted by his discovery in 1978, Mouck was determined to build his dream 
garden here, one inspired by the stone walls and turn-of-the-century post cards 
depicting California mission gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The post cards were part of a phenomenal interest in the California mission 
era, which spawned an architectural style featuring arches and low-pitched tile 
roofs; heavy, dark furniture, and gardens with a distinctly Spanish ambience. 
The results of the Mission Revival period, which began in the late 1890s and 
lasted well into the 1920s, were not exact copies of the missions or their 
gardens but romanticized versions, because true mission gardens, being designed 
for Franciscan fathers, had few creature comforts. 
</P>
<P>
During that period many missions were restored, and mission-inspired buildings 
sprouted everywhere, including Mouck's favorite, the massive Mission Inn in 
Riverside. Californians traveled up and down the state in their new 
automobiles, visiting the missions and purchasing post cards, many of which 
pictured idealized gardens full of plants that were considered quite novel and 
exotic at that time -- palms, olives, bird-of-paradise, hibiscus, cactus and 
succulents. A few of these plants existed in actual mission gardens, but most 
were more recent arrivals; Californians were just discovering what they could 
grow in this mild climate. 
</P>
<P>
From hundreds of these post cards, Mouck picked his favorite views and began 
planning his garden in 1982. A bell tower dominates nearly every post-card 
view, so in a great flight of fancy, Mouck built one to anchor his garden. Made 
of 2x4 framing covered with rough stucco, it is attached to the house, though 
it is visible only from the garden. Below the tower is a small tiled patio, 
another post-card feature, and a small archway that leads to the garden. 
Mouck's extensive bell collection celebrates the entry: Bells are hung from the 
branches of an old tree-sized hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is laid out in a cruciform pattern, with a Spanish-style fountain at 
the intersection of two paths. In some places, the paths are solid rock, 
natural outcroppings, and bordered by low stone walls that hold imported sandy 
soil, about 9 inches deep. All of the plants are drought-resistant because they 
must survive in shallow soil. (The garden won the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power Water Conservation Garden Contest in 1988.) Each of the four 
main beds is planted with a different color of lantana, which were salvaged 
from the Valley Drive-In Theater. Even the fountain is part salvage -- the base 
is an old industrial washbasin covered with river rock, with an imported 
Mexican fountain perched on top. 
</P>
<P>
Around the fountain are pots filled with cactus, and oleanders and crape 
myrtles make a screen at the edge of the garden. Other plants, though no longer 
novel, would have thrilled California tourists in the early 1900s: spiny aloes 
and agaves, neon-bright bougainvilleas, cascading plumbago, rosemary, yuccas 
and, of course, palms -- seen in nearly every early California post card.

Marcia Dinneen concedes that she's a bit naive about the ways of the film 
industry. The Minneapolis writer -- currently working there as a shipping clerk 
-- only discovered that her original screenplay for "An Unremarkable Life" had 
started filming when star Patricia Neal called to chat -- six weeks into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'This is Patricia Neal -- I'm starring in your movie,' " recalled 
Dinneen, who added, "This is my very first attempt at writing a screenplay, so 
I'm learning the ropes. When it was sold, I just assumed it would automatically 
be produced." 
</P>
<P>
The recently released pic is about two small-town Pennsylvania sisters -- 
played by Neal and Shelley Winters -- whose self-protective routine is upset 
when a local auto mechanic (Mako) begins courting Neal's character. 
</P>
<P>
After selling her script to producer-director Amin Q. Chaudhri, Dinneen wasn't 
involved in revisions, and is vague about her reaction to the movie. She's just 
completed her second screenplay and is talking with L.A. agents. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think it's a glamorous life," she said of her years of writing 
-- from articles to radio scripts. "They don't know how much work goes into 
it." John M. Wilson

LOOKS: BARE IS BEAUTIFUL; 
</P>
<P>
NEW PALETTES AND CUSTOM BLENDS GIVE BLACK SKIN NEUTRAL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES , Karen Grigsby Bates is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is neutral for black skin? Fashionable black women are pondering that 
question as the popularity of the neutral look (also referred to as "nude" or 
"naked" makeup) continues to increase. For fair skin, neutral immediately 
conjures up images of taupe, wheat, pale peach, shell-pink -- the kinds of 
colors that, if not adjusted properly, leave darker-hued women with a 
disconcertingly ashy look. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the beauty industry has recognized that black women are frequent 
purchasers of cosmetics and beauty regimens, including high-end, prestige 
lines, and many companies have adjusted their palettes accordingly. So 
achieving a neutral yellow, brown or black face is not as daunting a goal as it 
would have been years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some lines offer custom color blending, the ultimate in color matching. 
Prescriptives, for instance, introduced custom-blended liquid foundation about 
three years ago and recently added seven foundations in deep shades to give 
women with darker skin more choice, says company spokeswoman Anne Greenberg . A 
custom-blended powder was added last year. The 1990 Collection "is an extension 
and amplification of one's natural skin tone. The textures are matte and sheer, 
so they seem inseparable from one's own skin," Greenberg says. The 1990 colors 
can be worn by very fair- to very, very brown-skinned women with varying 
degrees of emphasis (deepening eye color, for instance), depending on the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that black women are blessed with skin that looks beautiful in a wide 
range of colors," says Andrea Robinson , president of Revlon's Ultima II, which 
has just introduced The Nakeds, cosmetics that emphasize the skin's color and 
texture. For Robinson, the key to interpreting the nude look for black women is 
how shade marries with skin tone. The Nakeds' Brush-On Foundation, now being 
introduced in Southern California, comes in shades from fairly pale to fairly 
brown and is not powder -- even though it is carried in a compact. The new 
foundation enhances rather than masks the skin's natural color and texture, a 
plus for women with good skin who are not afraid to show it off. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based Visage Beaute offers custom-blended everything -- so women 
with skin from alabaster and caramel to cocoa can come away from its counters 
with a neutral look precisely appropriate for them. The same polished, 
unmade-up effect -- nude color for a medium-brown-skinned woman and nude color 
for a woman with espresso-colored skin -- can be achieved with completely 
different colors. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing cosmetic components, rather than using everything from one line, works 
better for black women, advises Rudy Calvo, a Los Angeles-based makeup artist 
who counts actresses Cicely Tyson and Jasmine Guy and pop divas Patti LaBelle 
and Gladys Knight among his clients. Black women's deeper hues, Calvo says, 
"make color work better than on Caucasian skin; you can really blend color in 
for a natural look." 
</P>
<P>
Calvo's advice to black women who want to try the nude face: Soft, unfrosted 
shadows in simple colors are best, and matte lipstick is current and especially 
flattering on women with full, lush lips. Finally, Calvo admonishes, a more 
subtle approach to blush makes for an attractive, natural-looking face. "Too 
much blush makes you look harder. Concentrate on 'less is best.' "

OVERCOMING THE STRING SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The evolution of string groups in jazz has been a checkered story. The trouble 
usually is that you can lead a fiddle to the jazz group, but you can't make it 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the occasional violin soloist (Joe Venuti, Stuff Smith, Stephane 
Grappelli and a dozen others), string players (except, of course, those who 
played string bass primarily in its rhythm function) have shown themselves 
largely incapable of capturing the improvisational essence common to the great 
horn artists. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years several promising steps have been taken to correct 
the problem. The albums reviewed below are significant cases in point. 
</P>
<P>
UPTOWN STRING QUARTET: Philips 838-358-2. **** 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of Max Roach's Double Quartet, this group includes his daughter, 
Maxine Roach, on viola. She and the two violinists and cellist clearly have the 
qualifications to establish a jazz feeling when it is required. Working without 
a rhythm section, the foursome glides rather than swings, with an 
unconventional repertoire that includes "Jelly Roll Rag" and "Easy Winner," 
both achieving a quaint turn of the century flavor; arrangements by Bill Lee 
(Spike's father) of traditional African-American songs, and originals by Max 
Roach (arranged by Maxine) and Oscar Pettiford among others. Though the 
emphasis is on well phrased ensemble playing, there are enough solo touches to 
establish each members' individual credentials. 
</P>
<P>
WARREN VACHE AND THE BEAUXARTS STRING QUARTET: "Warm Evenings" Concorde Jazz 
CCD 4392 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
There is no attempt to use this quartet for purposes other than elaborate 
window dressing for a superior soloist, but this tradition goes all the way 
back to Charlie Parker with strings. The charts by Jack Gale support Vache's 
coronet in a set of standards, but the third and fourth cuts are mood-breakers 
in which he has only a rhythm section for backing. Vache has the right lyrical 
touch for Gordon Jenkins' "This Is All I Ask," in which the strings help him 
sublimate an already superior melody. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN HANDY WITH CLASS: "Centerpiece" Milestone MCD 9173-2. *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Handy's alto saxophone blends beautifully with three versatile colleagues: 
Julie Carter, Tarika Lewis, Sandi Poindexter. All three play the violin, sing, 
hum and scat -- on two cuts they even play and sing simultaneously, without 
overdubbing. Handy and another male singer joined the vocal proceedings here 
and there, but primarily this adventurous unit wins points, despite occasional 
intonation lapses, for the ingenious blending (in Handy's own arrangements) of 
his horn with voices and/or violins. Four of the eight tunes are based on the 
blues. 
</P>
<P>
DIZZY GILLESPIE: "The Symphony Sessions" ProJazz CDJ698 *** 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's regular quintet is surrounded by the Rochester Philharmonic, with 
John Dankworth conducting. The seven pieces are compositions he wrote 20 to 46 
years ago, some recorded in earlier versions that left no room for improvement. 
Nevertheless, Robert Farnon's arrangement of "Con Alma" and Mike Crotty's 
interesting treatment of "Fiesta Mojo" (with logical use of the strings) rise 
above the general level, as does the long, quasi-symphonic treatment by J.J. 
Johnson of "Night in Tunisia," composed in 1943. Gillespie's horn, though not 
always in optimum form, does eloquent justice to "Brother K.," his lyrical 
tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King. There is generally good solo work by Ron 
Holloway on tenor sax and the somewhat poorly recorded guitar of Ed Cherry. 
</P>
<P>
ART PEPPER: "The Complete Galaxy Recordings" Galaxy GCD-1016-2. ***** 
</P>
<P>
Strings play a minor role here, but on one of the 11 sessions Pepper was backed 
by a violins-and-celli ensemble for eight songs (five of which are heard 
additionally in alternate takes). Bill Holman and Jimmy Bond each wrote four of 
the arrangements, providing for Pepper what was clearly an inspiring harmonic 
cushion. On one of the Holman charts, "Blues in the Night," Pepper switched 
from alto saxophone to clarinet. The rest of this 16-CD set, selling for a mere 
$225, consists of Pepper's combo dates from 1978 through April 1982, seven 
weeks before his death. His choice of sidemen, and of songs, was impeccable. 
The pianists were George Cables, Stanley Cowell, Hank Jones and Tommy Flanagan. 
It would be hard to ask for anything more.

ALBUM REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN "AUTOMATIC," WARNER BROS. **** 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brothers Reid have made an art form of abrasiveness: a first album that 
dragged you through thickets of distortion to reach the sweetness at the 
center. Concerts marked by indifferent delivery and unpredictable (usually 
short) duration. Mumbling interviews. There's something refreshingly real about 
these surly, semi-articulate Scots and their pursuit of an eccentric ideal of 
pop perfection. 
</P>
<P>
They might have hit it with their third album. The Jesus and Mary Chain still 
works the same few rock archetypes -- blues, Velvet Underground two-chord rise 
and fall, Stooges grunge riffs, Ramones bubble-gum punk -- and this time, the 
Reids really make it sing and surge and soar. 
</P>
<P>
"Automatic's" power is its faith in simplicity and its inspiration is in the 
way it sabotages the structures it celebrates. William Reid approaches the 
guitar as a flamethrower, and by the end of the album he's trashed the terrain 
in just about every track, like the climactic shoot-out in an over-the-top 
apocalyptic battle movie. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reid's vocals remain detached, in these Phil Spector fever dreams of 
fumbling, glancing encounters. Though unease and madness emerge from the 
cryptic lyrics as the main motifs, the album refuses to wallow in Angst. The 
purity of the monolithic sound, the vocals' hypnotic pull, the pulverizing 
power, the uplifting tunes all see to that. 
</P>
<P>
The J&amp;MC ranges from pretty folk-pop ("Halfway to Crazy") to a clattering 
exercise in edginess ("Take It"), but it's the lean rockers like "Head On" that 
really carry the show. Jim sings: 
</P>
<P>
 And there's something going on inside 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you want to feel makes you want to try 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky ... 
</P>
<P>
 And the music makes you believe you could. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP EYE: IS SAVILE ROW READY FOR RIKKI ROCKETT'S T-SHIRTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watch out, Giorgio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
When Axl Rose took the stage last month for Guns N' Roses' momentous 
opening-night Coliseum gig with the Rolling Stones, he wore a T-shirt 
emblazoned with a death's head skull and the seamy slogan "Scumbag Hollywood 
Trash." 
</P>
<P>
The shirt's designers were delighted. "Yeh, Axl is a perfect guy to wear our 
stuff," explained Rikki Rockett, co-owner of Old Ghost Designs. "(Guns N' 
Roses' guitarist) Slash wore our 'Welcome to L.A.' shirt when they played the 
Cathouse. They're exactly the kind of rebellious, rock 'n' roll guys we're 
aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Rock Bad Boy fashion, Rockett is an expert -- he's the drummer 
in Poison, one of the country's hottest mascara 'n' metal rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
Rockett has certainly given his company a bona fide heavy-metal attitude. When 
he and partner John Grigley put on a fashion show recently, they rented out the 
Cathouse, a local headbanger hangout, and hired six exotic dancers to display 
their latest designs. 
</P>
<P>
Rockett says he's always dabbled as an artist and designer but never felt 
talented enough to pursue it as a career. But when he signed an endorsement 
deal with Vision Street Wear, a popular teen clothing firm, Rockett met 
Grigley, a skateboard hotshot who was working as a designer for the firm. Eager 
to improve his skateboard skills, Rockett invited Grigley to join Poison on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"He went out on the tour bus with us for a week -- and he survived!" said 
Rockett. "We got to be good friends. I liked his designs so much that I told 
him I'd back him if he wanted to do his own clothing line. So we're working 
together, using John's designs with our combined concepts. It's really fun. 
We're a little corporation, with our own attorney, accountant and publicist. In 
a way, it's like having another band -- cause all the concepts are ours." 
</P>
<P>
And what concepts! It's no wonder Rockett has dubbed Grigley the "porno 
Picasso" of T-shirt designers. After seeing some of their raunchy designs, 
Tipper Gore may put Old Ghost's T-shirts on the PMRC's condemned list. In 
addition to the customary skull and crossbones, coiled snakes and death mask 
designs, the T-shirts feature an eerie, skeletal Jesus on a cross, a "Dead 
People Are Cool" design, several obscene slogans and a picture of gang members 
spread-eagled in front of a cop car, with the slogan "Welcome to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to stay close to what we see in the streets," said Rockett. 
"In fact, after we did the 'Welcome' shirt, I was driving down La Brea when I 
saw a bunch of gang kids on their knees, being searched by the cops. And I 
must've slowed down to watch, 'cause the cops started staring at me, wondering 
what I'm looking at. And I'm thinking -- I'm looking at my shirt, happening 
right out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Rockett and Grigley's catalogue focuses on T-shirts, turtlenecks and bracelets, 
though Rockett says they're expanding into skirts, caps and leg warmers. For 
now, Old Ghost designs are available at several Melrose Avenue stores, 
including Tiziana and Zulu, as well as Showcase Cycles on La Brea Avenue. (The 
pair has plans to eventually open their own retail outlet.) 
</P>
<P>
"Our stuff is very anti-fashion," said Rockett, who is headed up to Vancouver 
to begin work on Poison's third album. "It's certainly not the kind of stuff 
you'd expect to see in an art gallery."

HEAD ON THE TOWN: Tone-Loc's touring Australia now -- but last month the rotund 
rap idol was cruising Santa Monica Boulevard in his Mercedes when he spotted a 
white '63 Impala convertible at a red light. Eyeing the slick Impala, Loc said: 
"Hey, how much?" Its driver replied: "The car's not for sale." Loc followed the 
Impala to the next red light, where he made another sales pitch, only to be 
turned down again. Finally, Loc's passenger recognized the driver (and his 
red-headed companion). It was . . . Bruce Springsteen (and Patti Scialfa). The 
two stars hit it off so much that they ended up hanging out in the middle of 
the street, yakking about their favorite music. . . . And yes, that was Joni 
Mitchell at the China Club the other night, long after midnight, dancing to the 
raucous rock sounds of the Dynatones. Mitchell even took the microphone and 
helped out on a noisy rendition of "Land of a Thousand Dances."

NOTEBOOK: MORTON OUT TO PROVE HE'S SALT OF THE EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Morton doesn't necessarily want to save the world -- but he wouldn't mind 
helping save the planet. The Los Angeles-based restaurateur -- who owns 
Morton's and the Hard Rock Cafe here and additional Hard Rocks in San Diego, 
San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Honolulu, New Orleans and Sydney, Australia 
(with yet another in the works in Las Vegas) -- has even established a Save the 
Planet Department in the corporate offices of his 1,600-employee company. 
</P>
<P>
And what does this department do? "It coordinates and undertakes activities 
that will help the environment," says Morton. For instance? "To begin with," he 
replies, "we recycle every bottle that comes into our properties -- beer 
bottles, wine bottles, Coke bottles. We recycle all our cardboard. We have 
discontinued the use of Styrofoam, and buy only line-caught albacore tuna (nets 
are undesirable because they trap and kill dolphins along with tuna). Any money 
we earn from recycling, we give to local charities. Besides that, we donate any 
extra food we have to the local missions on both a daily and a weekly basis in 
all Hard Rock cities. We hold benefits to raise funds for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. We put out a newsletter for all our employees, telling them 
what they can do personally -- like recycling paper at the office, not throwing 
their newspapers out at home, and getting rid of fluorocarbon products." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, his company has started using a biodegradable plastic bag to 
package the immensely popular Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts the restaurants sell -- 
some six to seven million of them a year, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't suddenly start doing this since environmental issues have become 
rather fashionable," Morton continues. "The phrase 'Save the Planet' has 
appeared above the Hard Rock logo for seven years, and we established our 
department two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Of course some environmental issues are easier to face than others. "All the 
products at both Morton's and the L.A. Hard Rock come from the Malibu Herb 
Farm," says Morton, "and are pesticide-free. But California is always in the 
forefront of things like organic farms, and the same situation doesn't 
necessarily exist everywhere. For the Hard Rock in New Orleans, it's much 
tougher to think about using organic produce, because the community there just 
isn't making the same kinds of demands on produce growers." And what about the 
problems said to be caused by existing commercial refrigeration systems, which 
release Freon-12 into the atmosphere? "Well," says Morton, "we're looking into 
it. But it's real tough to suddenly convert all your refrigeration to a new 
system." 
</P>
<P>
(Freon footnote: The Bruce Marder/Michel Richard/Marvin Zeidler Broadway Deli, 
scheduled to open next spring in Santa Monica, will reportedly be the first 
restaurant in the L.A. area with a Freon-12-free refrigeration system.) 
</P>
<P>
What does Morton hope his Save the Planet Department will ultimately 
accomplish? "We're just trying to be as socially responsible as we can," he 
replies. "And we're hoping to encourage other restaurateurs in the communities 
we serve to do some of the same things. If anybody's interested, I wish they'd 
call me up. I'd have somebody from our department drive out there and show them 
how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S COOKING: Duplex in the Los Feliz district welcomes Groth Vineyards 
winemaker Nils Venge on Tuesday, with a four-course dinner accompanied by his 
wines. Cost is $65 per person, and the event begins at 7:30 p.m. . . . The 
American Institute of Wine &amp; Food will hold an International Wine Auction 
Saturday night, at the Four Seasons Hotel -- with a supper to be provided by 
chef/restaurateurs Evan Kleiman (the Angeli restaurants), Bruce Marder (West 
Beach Cafe, Rebecca's, DC-3), Michael McCarty (Michael's), Laurent Quenioux 
(Seventh Street Bistro), and Mauro Vincenti (Rex il Ristorante, Pazzia), among 
others. Admission to the event, which begins at 8:30 p.m., is $250 per person, 
with proceeds benefitting the AIWF. Among the items to be auctioned will be two 
magnums of 1961 Chateau Latour, a magnum of 1917 Chateau Palmer, and dinner for 
six at the home of Julia Child. . . . Indigo in Los Angeles plans a gala dinner 
and silent art auction to benefit two local AIDS care facilities next Sunday,. 
Tickets are $100 per person.

WHITHER MAHLER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like columnist Herbert Glass, we too noticed that the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
is programming only one Mahler symphony this coming season (On the Record, Nov. 
5). 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four years ago, a number of us Mahler fanatics marched good-naturedly at 
the Music Center, demanding more Mahler. Our group was born that night. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while America takes a Mahlerian respite, Europe is playing him wall to 
wall and Japan is worshiping at his shrine. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mr. Glass' complaint about Mahler being possibly out of favor, it could 
be time for us to dust off the old picket signs and show our displeasure in 
front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.

'TRAGEDY OF KUSC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFAC's demise is difficult for classical music lovers to endure; the continuing 
tragedy of KUSC is even more difficult for us. 
</P>
<P>
KUSC seems to have decided to enlarge its format by appealing to a broader 
audience. It now features a program of Viennese waltzes, expansion of the news 
service to be highly redundant, artsy programs of little merit, and 
professional lecturers who would love to educate the listeners to the 
highlights of the third movement of whatever symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Music lovers implore KUSC's board of directors to return to a largely mature 
classical format, omitting such programs. Short of this happening, the 
listening base of KUSC will surely be eroded.

THE ASC'S POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Society of Cinematographers wishes to comment on Don Shannon's 
Oct. 25 article, "Panel Weighs Moral Rights of Film Alteration." The report of 
our position on moral-rights issues in copyright protection could easily be 
misread, leaving one with the impression that our members have no objections to 
coloring black-and-white films or altering motion pictures in any way for 
television exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
We do not favor alterations made to accommodate the limitations of television 
formats and videocassette markets. On the other hand, we do not oppose 
alterations that have been supervised by the principal contributors of the 
original film. 
</P>
<P>
As stated by our representative before a Senate subcommittee Oct. 24, we are 
opposed to coloring productions that were intended to be seen in 
black-and-white, to the panning and scanning of pictures that were shot for 
wide-screen presentations and to changing the pace of a motion picture in order 
to meet the schedules of networks, independent stations or advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
We are especially against arbitrary decisions made by strangers to the 
collaborative effort. 
</P>
<P>
When the American Society of Cinematographers discussed the ownership of a 
motion picture vis-a-vis the artistic endeavors that films contain, the ASC 
concluded that the owner has copyright protection. If Congress should declare 
that the contributing artists of a motion picture do deserve to have their work 
protected, then all principal contributors should be protected equally. In the 
meantime, the ASC feels that any materially altered film should be labeled 
accordingly to protect the integrity of all of the creators.

COLLECTING: AROUND HOME;

<P>
MODEL CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STILL IN STICKER shock after looking at that fire-breathing Corvette you've 
always wanted? No problem, you can still buy one -- you just have to scale back 
your fantasy a bit -- 1/43rd scale might be the ticket or 1/20 if you're a 
bigger spender. Your dream car -- model-size version -- is waiting for you to 
claim it. All you need is a shelf, coffee table or display case large enough to 
hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting prebuilt, preassembled model cars is one of the few areas of 
collecting that doesn't require a loan from the bank. "Prices range from $2 to 
$500," says John Nobert of Autofanatics Ltd, "the top end being a hand-built 
model so real that you couldn't tell it from the real thing in a photograph." 
</P>
<P>
Nobert, a former lawyer who started his business in 1975, says almost all of 
his customers are between 25 and 60 years old. "Collectors are adults in love 
with cars. Those who can't afford the real car want a model, and the people who 
can afford them want something to put on the coffee table." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the newer models are made from resin plastic; the better ones show 
incredible attention to detail. There are some collectors who prefer the 
earlier technology of white-metal die-cast versions; again, the best ones are 
the models that are fully detailed. 
</P>
<P>
Car model collecting is very big in Europe, with stores in every major city and 
in most mid-sized towns as well. Not surprisingly, many models are manufactured 
overseas, many of them replicas of such beloved American icons as the 1934 
Chrysler Airflow and 1955 Chevrolet Nomad station wagon. Portugal's Vitese, 
England's Brooklin and France's Solido offer good quality and large selection.

MARK HAMPTON ON DECORATING BY MARK HAMPTON (RANDOM HOUSE, INC.; 1989) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Thornburg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A PRIMER FOR NOVICE and professional alike, "Mark Hampton on Decorating" is a 
leisurely examination of rooms with a sense of history and personal style -- 
and a treatise on how to live well. Hampton, perhaps best known as the White 
House decorator, shows 40 original watercolors and 60 black-and-white washes to 
illustrate the "classic" look he made famous, a blend of modern and traditional 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
Arrayed in seven sections, his essays -- taken from his monthly House and 
Garden column -- cover all elements of interior design from laying out an 
interior to the emotional impact of color. If you've ever wondered why small 
rooms appear larger painted in deep colors, Hampton has the answer: "The reason 
is that the boundaries of space become lost in shadow, the walls and corners 
seem to recede." "The effect," he suggests, "is most noticeable in small 
hallways, studies and libraries where their application evokes a hushed, 
peaceful quality." 
</P>
<P>
He also counsels on the use of overscale furniture: "Instead of putting a sofa 
on the obvious long wall, consider using an imposing piece of real furniture. 
And if your room is really huge, anchor the whole thing down with a center 
table." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton traces historical origins (the slipper chair is derived from the 
18th-Century French chauffeuse), and advises on diverse interior elements: 
fireplaces, lamps, mirrors, seating, framing, bed and bedposts. Dressing 
windows and setting the table are also grist for the mill. Explored are various 
styles, from Victorian -- which has made a comeback in recent years -- to 
classicism, which Hampton feels is "always new." Delights of chinoiserie are 
extolled: "There isn't a house in the world that wouldn't allow you to indulge 
in a little Oriental monkey business." ($24.95) Barbara Thornburg

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EXPERTS ARE SURE THE DOW WILL EITHER RISE OR 
DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One guy on Wall Street thinks that the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 
8% more before the end of the year. Another agrees, but he's concerned that if 
the Federal Reserve doesn't continue to reduce interest rates, the stock market 
could go even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you have to hit people on Wall Street over the head before they see 
the obvious. In this case, it took the investment community until last week to 
start realizing that corporate profits are becoming so weak that the stock 
market may be in for some bad time ahead. 
</P>
<P>
As I mentioned a few weeks ago, not everyone was oblivious to the 
corporate-profit trap. A minority in the investment community realized as early 
as this past summer that things weren't right in corporate America. But by and 
large, the vast majority of those on Wall Street thought that everything was 
hunky-dory -- until last week. 
</P>
<P>
Now, suddenly, most people who make their living peddling stocks are asking 
themselves one question: How low can it go? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market is going to seek some level between 2,300 and 2,400 on the 
Dow over the next two or three weeks," says Anthony Woodruff, the head trader 
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "I think the whole economy is slowing. There are 
recession fears," and, says Woodruff, there just isn't enough optimism to go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer for First Albany Corp., and one of 
the few who was warning investors in September, thinks that stocks will become 
attractive again when the Dow gets down to the 2,400 level. But Johnson isn't 
just worried about what is happening to corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what's going on now that's the problem," says Johnson. "It's what 
lies ahead that's making everyone nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Fears were eased a bit last week when the Federal Reserve reduced interest 
rates, allowing the closely watched federal funds rate to drop to about 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that action, a lot of people on Wall Street are still concerned. A 
slight reduction in interest rates is not enough to bolster the sagging 
economy. And a big drop in interest rates is unlikely while inflation is still 
a concern here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
If the Dow were to drop to between 2,300 and 2,400, it would represent a loss 
of about one-tenth of its value. But if the decline comes suddenly, as it did 
Oct. 13, it could prove very damaging to the stock market's already-sagging 
confidence. And then there is no telling where the bottom will be. 
</P>
<P>
There are some people on Wall Street who see good things ahead for the stock 
market, if only short term. 
</P>
<P>
Richard McCabe, head of technical market analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., 
for instance, thinks that stocks will go higher for the six weeks in the 
traditional year-end rally. 
</P>
<P>
But McCabe is anything but an optimist over the longer term. Says McCabe: "The 
Dow might yet make one new high. But we may then see more correction in 1990." 
McCabe says he wouldn't be surprised if stock prices dropped 20% to 25% during 
next year's first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
John Connolly, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, is one of a 
very small group that thinks stocks are not vulnerable. "I don't think there is 
a great downside potential here," Connolly says of the market. Why? Because he 
thinks that the Fed -- despite persistent problems with inflation -- has 
already begun to come to the rescue of the economy by reducing interest rates 
and will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? The majority isn't always wrong. I'd count on stocks slipping more 
than they rise in the months ahead -- even if there is a traditional December 
upturn. 
</P>
<P>
The "Rabbit" died. 
</P>
<P>
At least it appears that an attempt to raid Greyhound Corp. -- code-named 
"Rabbit" by the guy leading the charge -- won't occur soon. 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street source says Daniel Good, an investment banker who made his mark 
as an adviser to corporate raiders while at Shearson Lehman Hutton, has been 
trying to line up partners for a run at the Phoenix-based company. 
</P>
<P>
But sources tell me that Good is having the same problem as everyone else -- 
raising financing for a takeover. In fact, his troubles appear to have stunned, 
if not killed, any plans that Good had for Greyhound. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing going on in this kind of market," says Good, who denied 
having any interest in Greyhound. Good added that he didn't think the takeover 
business would improve in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Good's denial, a reliable source on Wall Street tells me that Good has 
been making the rounds for the past few months carrying a data book on 
Greyhound, a company best known for the bus lines that it no longer owns. These 
days Greyhound makes an assortment of consumer products and runs a 
financial-services business. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound has been a rumored takeover target for years. Good apparently 
believes that Greyhound is worth a lot more than its stock price, which last 
week was about $31. And Good has apparently even persuaded some investors to 
kick in a few bucks. 
</P>
<P>
But the banks are balking. And it's no wonder. Not everyone thinks as highly of 
Greyhound as Good does. An analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, for instance, has 
said publicly that he thinks Greyhound's stock is worth just $35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has been mentioned most often as a possible 
suitor. Jacobs, however, has sold his Greyhound shares. A source tells me that 
he dumped the last of his Greyhound stock earlier this year. So Jacobs won't be 
carrying this rabbit's foot around. 
</P>
<P>
An adviser to 250 retirement funds is telling his clients to get out of growth 
stocks now and into more conservative stocks with intrinsic values. And more 
important, he's telling them that by next February they should have only 25% of 
their money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moseson, president of Performance Analytics Inc., Chicago, says that 
growth stocks have done so well over the past year that they can't do much 
better. With the economy slowing, it's time for pension funds to start putting 
their money into more conservative stocks that have low price-to-earnings 
ratios and good income, he recently told clients. 
</P>
<P>
"People right now should move away from growth stocks -- like cellular 
telephone companies -- and toward higher-yielding stocks, like blue chips 
paying high-dividend yields," says Moseson. 
</P>
<P>
Moseson believes that different types of investment strategies take their turns 
in the limelight. And he thinks that the next strategy that will prosper is one 
that emphasizes higher-dividend, value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
When you think of people who have declared personal bankruptcy, you may 
envision down-on-their-luck losers destined for failure. But a new study by a 
group of professors shows that such a supposition is far from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Warren, law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says before 
her study of personal bankruptcy filings began, she assumed that a majority of 
the victims would be from one group -- an underclass of society. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead we found it was a cross section of the middle class of America," says 
Warren, whose co-authors are professors Jay Westbrook and Teresa Sullivan of 
the University of Texas. "We had accountants, dentists and entrepreneurs, as 
well as truck drivers." 
</P>
<P>
The professors studied 1,557 bankruptcy cases that were filed in Texas, 
Illinois and Pennsylvania. Warren said there was "no overwhelming reason" for 
bankruptcy filings except, generally, there was an "income interruption" 
because of illness or loss of job. "They can't keep up with their debt 
service," she added. 
</P>
<P>
But Warren said the blame can't be placed solely on borrowers. Lenders, she 
said, have been too willing to give loans to unqualified people. "The credit 
industry isn't being very careful," Warren adds, and doesn't shut off the 
spigot even when a borrower has debts wildly out of proportion to their income. 
</P>
<P>
Some other observations: 
</P>
<P>
* Medical debts aren't nearly as important in causing bankruptcy as had been 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
* Debtors in bankruptcy tend to have more kids -- an average of 3.4 to the 
normal 2.7. 
</P>
<P>
* Only about 45% of the wives work, compared to 60% in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
* One of five debtors in the study who filed for bankruptcy has operated his 
own small business. 
</P>
<P>
* And, nine of 10 who file for bankruptcy list some credit card debt. 
</P>
<P>
THE RUNOFF: The second deadline for making bids on Hilton Hotels Corp. is 
sometime this month, say Wall Street sources, who wouldn't be more specific. 
The sources say negotiations will begin after that, and a winner could be 
announced in December. There is still strong interest in Hilton, which put 
itself up for sale last summer, but some of the tire kickers have dropped out, 
the sources say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Sorte, co-head of investment banking at Drexel Burnham Lambert, says the 
leveraged buyout business is "very slow" right now, with deals "few and far 
between." Sorte says either borrowing costs paid by acquirers or acquisition 
prices have to come down to revive the business. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As I said a few weeks ago, there are still lots of corporate takeovers in the 
works. two weeks ago, it was Georgia-Pacific Corp. going after Great Northern 
Nekoosa. Wall Street sources say there's another small deal in the $500-million 
range coming soon and still another one twice that size is in the advanced 
stages of planning. Most of the deals are companies buying other companies -- 
sometimes in an unfriendly manner. Corporate raiders aren't very active . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, says there is one portion of the 
takeovers business that is still doing well. Acquisitions of companies worth 
$100 million or less by foreigners -- cross-border acquisitions, KMPG calls 
them -- rose 22% in the second quarter, compared to a drop of 40% in deals 
worth $100 million or more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Coniston Partners, the sometime corporate raider, has filed for a new 
partnership in Delaware that it's calling Condor. Coniston says it's just one 
of 20-odd partnerships that it has registered in that state. Wall Street's 
ever-imaginative speculators, however, think that the partnership may have 
something to do with Coniston's interest in making trouble for the management 
of UAL Corp. They figured this out, you see, because both condors and UAL's 
airplanes fly. Get the connection?

ROGER SIMON: A STRATEGY THAT BEARS REPEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has 
become dull. 
</P>
<P>
His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make 
news. He went on "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
This was no small thing. During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, 
Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows. He didn't 
appear on "Meet the Press" or "This Week With David Brinkley" or "Face the 
Nation." 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news. His every 
slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news. 
</P>
<P>
He was the stuff of nightly TV monologues. "A lot of people feel Quayle is just 
too inexperienced for a do-nothing job," Jay Leno once said. 
</P>
<P>
That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: 
Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to 
make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't 
qualified for a job that had no qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the 
President and make himself a very small target. Stay out of the headlines and 
give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We had asked him on the show a number of times," Christie Basham, senior 
producer of "Meet the Press" told me, "but he always declined. We renewed our 
request and then after saying he would not do the show, he changed his mind and 
said he would. It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone 
above and beyond the usual guest." 
</P>
<P>
And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered 
"above and beyond" the usual guest. Normally, a vice president would not be. 
That's because vice presidents don't actually do anything. They don't run 
departments or make policy. They mostly wait for heads of state to expire. As 
George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president: "You die; I fly." 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up. He might 
make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the President. 
</P>
<P>
None of this happened. The show was uneventful. Quayle answered all the 
questions put to him and he made little if any news. Some major newspapers 
didn't even bother to do a story the next day. 
</P>
<P>
It was everything Quayle had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a 
major interview show. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job," 
Beckwith said. "He wanted to solidify his relationship with the President and 
learn the inner workings of the administration." 
</P>
<P>
So why go on now? 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a particularly opportune week," Beckwith said. George Bush and 
Mikhail Gorbachev had announced a summit. Central America was back in the news. 
And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"And Marlin (Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman) called and just suggested we do the 
show," Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush's first major (and some would say 
only) decision of his presidential campaign. He had input from a number of 
people, but Quayle was George Bush's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Many thought it was a terrible choice, but there is nothing like a victory to 
give everything a rosy glow. And Bush's announcement that Quayle would be his 
running mate again was Bush's way of saying: "I didn't screw up the first time. 
I made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right 
it was, I am making it again." 
</P>
<P>
And now was the time for Quayle to go on "Meet the Press" and show everybody 
just how right George Bush had been. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Beckwith if Quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone. 
</P>
<P>
"He was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions," Beckwith 
said. "A lot of the time, you never know what you're going to get into. 
Sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious." 
</P>
<P>
A typical example of a "non-serious" question often put to Dan Quayle is: "Why 
does everyone say your wife is smarter than you?" 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle got no questions like that last week. I asked Christie Basham of 
"Meet the Press" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be. 
"Yes," Basham said, "but almost all the guests do." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth 
Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions. (If Quayle had 
been told the questioners were going to be Hunter Thompson and Jimmy Breslin, I 
have a feeling Quayle might have come down with laryngitis.) 
</P>
<P>
After the show, Fitzwater called Quayle to express his, and presumably the 
President's, pleasure at how Quayle had handled himself. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well. 
</P>
<P>
"The very limitations of a vice president's role don't make him an ideal 
guest," Beckwith admitted. "Almost by job description, a vice president is not 
permitted to make serious news." 
</P>
<P>
And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that. During the 1988 campaign, I 
interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle 
would run for President in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
And he will do so, I believe, by being a vice president who keeps his head 
down, his nose clean and his life dull. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it worked for George Bush.

Do you have electricity? Do you have a toilet seat? Can you open the sliding 
window in your bedroom? Stay right where you are. Do not move to another house. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a telephone? Call everyone you know and enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Have you a patch of lawn and a few green plants? Talk to your plants. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know where your other pink shoe is or even your purse? Good for you. Do 
you know where your toothbrushes are? Go brush your teeth and appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know where your dog is because you have a fenced yard with a gate? Go 
pet your dog. I know where Peaches is but at the cost of 24-hour vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
We are officially in our house in Laguna de la Paz in La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
After four weeks with my patient and hospitable friend, Jean Erck, and two days 
and nights with my son, Tim, and his wife, Geri, we moved into the house. The 
movers started four days ago to move the two garages full of stuff from where 
it had been sitting for almost five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The moving crew was Latino -- amiable, gracious men led by their employer, a 
man named Frank who went to Notre Dame. The only small deterrent to a 
silk-smooth move was that none of the gentlemen spoke English except Frank, who 
was frequently somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
I, to my shame, after an entire life spent in Southern California, speak no 
Spanish. I used to be able to speak French haltingly, but the only thing I 
remember is how to warn a small female child that the street car is coming and 
that is very hard to work into a conversation, even if those around you are 
speaking French. And when all of those around you are speaking Spanish, it 
doesn't make for great communication. 
</P>
<P>
As the crew could not read English, all of the careful marking of the boxes all 
of my dear friends had done before we left Pasadena might as well have been 
Urdu. I stood at the back of the truck and looked at every box as they dug it 
out and gave the Spanish names of rooms I could remember, "cocina . . . sala." 
</P>
<P>
By the time we were on the third truckful, I was hoarse, and a great deal of 
kitchen stuff was in my bedroom. During the course of a long afternoon, the 
gentlemen dropped an oak filing cabinet, which broke off all the casters and 
made a wound in the side of the file. Fortunately, I didn't roll that filing 
cabinet very often, and if I push it between two other filing cabinets, you 
can't see where the piece is missing. Frank says he'll think of something. I 
know he will because I have faith in Notre Dame men. 
</P>
<P>
I have electricity now and Thomas Alva Edison himself could not have been more 
thrilled when he saw the light flicker on and stay on. The telephone company 
says that "the rope" has to be pulled through before I can have a telephone. 
Did you know they worked on ropes? Me neither. 
</P>
<P>
I am told that I will have television by Thanksgiving. Actually, I don't care 
much, but I will miss the evening news and an occasional football game and 
public television. Actually, I don't care if I ever see a sitcom full of 
ill-mannered adolescents ever again, so that's all right. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if I can find someone to hook up the washer and dryer, things will be 
improved. I now have shower doors and hot water, so as I chase Peaches through 
the avenues of unfinished houses, I will be clean and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter-in-law and Tim worked for two days putting up beds and emptying 
boxes. Geri took vacation days to help me. 
</P>
<P>
The sky is a soft turquoise and this morning at Tim's the sunrise was coral and 
gold. The air is like a kiss from an almost forgotten love and I have met some 
delightful people who have enchanted gardens and beautiful flowers.

<P>
Oh, go ahead, move.

MISS MANNERS: A STORY -- YOU SUPPLY THE MORAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom does retribution for a violation of etiquette come so swiftly. Miss 
Manners cannot resist telling you a story with a severe moral (although she 
will try to resist telling it gleefully): 
</P>
<P>
An old-fashioned lady was giving one of her old-fashioned dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
Being of the old school, she had assembled her guest list not only for 
conversational compatibility, but so that the table would be surrounded by 
neatly alternating ladies and gentlemen. But on the day of the dinner, one of 
the guests called to say that she couldn't make it, but would stop in afterward 
for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Not able to make it? As the hostess well knew, the only excuse for canceling 
out of a dinner party is sudden death. Lingering death won't do. 
</P>
<P>
This guest didn't sound dead at all. Her health was confirmed by the cheerful 
tone in which she explained that she had been invited to a fancy dinner given 
by someone quite important, and that she believed it would be useful to her 
career to go. She added that the gentleman with whom she lived -- and who had 
been invited -- would keep the original engagement, as he was not included in 
the later invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Now the hostess was so old-fashioned that she had no trouble whatsoever with 
unmarried couples living together -- she believed that this aspect of their 
life was none of her business. But to have someone frankly confess canceling a 
dinner date because a more advantageous opportunity arose shocked her into near 
immobility. 
</P>
<P>
She was strict enough, however, not to consider social catastrophe to be an 
excuse for letting down her guests. They could have survived without a full 
table, but this lady, the sort of perfectionist who measured the distance 
between place settings when setting the table, believed it her duty to fill in 
all the blanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Extra lady, extra lady," she thought desperately. "Whom do I know well enough 
to ask such a favor?" (She knew, of course, that while it is a compliment to a 
guest to issue an invitation at the proper time, it is an intimate favor to ask 
someone to come at the last minute. Proper reciprocation is not only a 
subsequent invitation, made far in advance, but the silent acknowledgement that 
the hostess must make every effort to be available for last-minute duty at that 
person's parties.) And then she thought of someone perfect -- someone who would 
not only even out the dinner table but grace it with beauty and wit. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that is what happened. And the party was a success. Even the gentleman 
who had been left behind, while his lady had moved up to something grander, 
seemed to be enjoying himself. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he especially seemed to be enjoying himself. When the lady with whom 
he lived showed up as promised, for coffee -- prompting her hostess to believe 
that her coffee must be better than the other host's, for surely the social 
honor system could not have been a factor -- she found him sitting on a 
drawing-room sofa, next to the replacement guest. 
</P>
<P>
They were merely sipping coffee, chatting quietly and looking at each other, as 
proper guests do after a proper meal. The old-fashioned hostess thought their 
behavior impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
But the latecomer didn't. She took one look at them and understood immediately 
what had happened. As a desperate last-minute move to salvage her private life, 
she attempted to insert herself into the non-existent space between them. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too late. The gentleman escorted the latecomer home, and the other 
lady thanked her hostess, who pressed her hand warmly in a silent gesture of 
return thanks for saving the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is happy to report that some time after the dinner party, the 
gentleman and the so-called extra lady were married. This is a true story, and 
she invites her readers to supply the moral.

Even though tickets were $500 and $5,000 a couple for the gourmet five-course 
dinner prepared by 27 amateur sous chefs, there was an overflow crowd for 
Planned Parenthood's Men's Dinner XI at DC-3 restaurant in Santa Monica. To 
accommodate the crowd, 32 volunteered in advance to sit in a side room and one 
table of eight agreed to dine in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Mickey Bodek chairs the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood Guild. That 
meant that her husband, Gordon Bodek, automatically became chief sous chef 
under tutelage of Bruce Marder, DC-3 chef proprietor, and Bill Hufferd, 
executive chef. The chefs studied assiduously; now they're experts at fish stew 
and chocolate souffle pie. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of prominent names among the new members of The Bachelors: 
William Howard Ahmanson, Peter Aronson, Geffrey Clark, Whitley Collins, Bradley 
Farwell, Robert Fuelling, George Hotaling II, Craig Lewis, Peter McDonnell, 
Chancey Medberry IV, Keith Presher, John Sandberg, Grafton Tanquary III, John 
Turner and William Haven Williams. Their official Stag Dinner is Dec. 7 at the 
Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
ON RECORD: Said chairman Tony Moiso: "We got lucky -- by birth -- because we 
can enjoy being a part of these traditions of California." He was speaking to

luncheon at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
The first speaker, Ann Babcock (great-great-granddaughter of Gen. Harrison Gray 
Otis), noted that today's courthouse stands on what was once known as Poundcake 
Hill. Elita Hotaling (great-granddaughter of Thomas Lorenzo Duque, one-time 
owner of the San Felipe Rancho of San Diego County) said that Westlake Park, 
now MacArthur Park, was once the city dump. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Forgie Biersteker (great-great-granddaughter of Don Mateo Keller, who 
owned the 13,000-acre Malibu rancho) said that because of Mrs. Alphonzo Bell's 
travels in Italy, many of the roads in Bel-Air, developed by her husband in the 
1920s, have Italian nomenclature. 
</P>
<P>
FLIGHT: Barbara and Frank Sinatra's "Magic Carpet" weekend to benefit the 
Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower Medical Center takes flight

NEGOTIATOR IN RAIDERS TALKS GONE; 
</P>
<P>
IRWINDALE: AS THE CITY'S KEY NEGOTIATOR LEAVES AGAIN, RAIDERS EXECUTIVES, THEIR 
PATIENCE WANING, VOICE SKEPTICISM ABOUT ACHIEVING A STADIUM PROJECT. 
</P>

IRWINDALE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as city officials were sounding optimistic again about landing the 
Raiders, one of Irwindale's key negotiators left -- for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Hermosillo, who was fired as public relations consultant in May, 1988, 
and then rehired earlier this year at $100 an hour, has left again, for 
undisclosed reasons. His departure has left Raiders executives skeptical about 
Irwindale's ability to put together a stadium project for the team. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale officials were not available for comment late last week. Hermosillo 
said Tuesday that he and attorney R. Zaiden Corrado, also hired by the city to 
work on the stadium project, mutually agreed to end his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may interpret my departure as a dismissal," he said, "but I have not been 
fired. I chose to leave because of philosophical differences that arose." 
</P>
<P>
Just days before Hermosillo's departure two weeks ago, a San Diego-based 
conglomerate reportedly expressed interested in financing the stadium project, 
and Irwindale officials scheduled a Nov. 7 meeting with the Raiders to discuss 
plans for acquiring a site west of the San Gabriel River Freeway. One source 
close to the project who asked not to be identified said Hermosillo was the one 
responsible for finding the conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Hermosillo gone and still no concrete plan within reach, the Raiders' 
patience is waning. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many personnel changes, it's hard to keep up with," Raiders 
senior executive John Herrera said Wednesday. "We go into a meeting and have to 
ask, who's involved now? It's another example of the revolving door. It makes 
things difficult because of the lack of continuity." 
</P>
<P>
But, Corrado said, if Irwindale failed and the Raiders went to Oakland or 
Sacramento -- two cities also trying to lure them -- it wouldn't be the city's 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a partnership to make the dream a reality," Corrado said. "We've 
asked for face-to-face discussions with Mr. (Al) Davis in the spirit of 
cooperation. Mr. Davis has refused to meet with us." 
</P>
<P>
Hopes to move forward with stadium plans were set back a few months ago when 
the Koll Co., a Newport Beach-based development firm considering the stadium 
project, announced that it and its partner, Ohbayashi America Corp., were no 
longer interested. The decision came about the same time that Oakland and 
Sacramento were beefing up their offers to sponsor the team. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo's departure leaves only one of the three signers of the 2-year-old, 
$115-million deal with Davis: City Atty. and Manager Charles Martin. Frederick 
Lyte, the redevelopment consultant who played a major part in the city's 
transformation into a prosperous business center, was fired earlier this year 
after a falling out with then-Mayor Patricio Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
The city is in the midst of a legal dispute with Lyte over the nearly $1 
million he received as commissions on redevelopment projects. Although the city 
approved the payments 12 years ago when it first hired Lyte, it now claims that 
the contract violated conflict-of-interest laws, and is suing to recover the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge threw out a 
cross-complaint filed by Lyte seeking $10 million in punitive damages from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
But Herrera said he hasn't given up on Irwindale, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to throw cold water on anything they may have," he said.

DEVELOPERS USE $100 BOOK FOR ESTATE-OF-THE-ART ADVERTISING; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY PARK: SOME POSH HILLTOP ESTATES, MANY OF THEM NOT YET BUILT, ARE 
FEATURED IN A COFFEE-TABLE BOOK ALONG WITH MANY OF THE OLDEST AND MOST ELEGANT 
MANSIONS ON THE WESTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Developers of the hilltop Beverly Park Estates have published the second 
edition of a lush coffee-table book called "The Estates of Beverly Hills," 
complete with an entire chapter that puts their scenic but largely unbuilt 
neighborhood on a par with the fanciest homes of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted our future audience . . . to find through reading this book that 
there's a new opportunity in town," said Brian Adler, principal developer of 
the property high above Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity people haven't had since the 1930s -- to get a house on 
two level acres . . . with city and canyon views," he said. "It's the feeling 
of what an estate is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Carved out of the hillsides north of Beverly Hills in the 1960s by bulldozers 
moving 8 million cubic yards of earth, the land was originally intended for a 
country club project that was to have been named after entertainer Dean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
That deal fell through, along with several other efforts involving a Teamsters 
Union pension fund, but developer Elliot Gottfurcht managed to consolidate 16 
lots on part of the property, a ridge overlooking Franklin Canyon, before he 
sold out to Adler and his associates last year. 
</P>
<P>
The first edition of "The Estates of Beverly Hills," financed by developer 
Gottfurcht, came out in 1984, filled with stories and pictures of the stately 
homes of Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills. Hoping for gilt by 
association, Gottfurcht devoted a few of the book's oversized, 100% rag cotton 
pages to sketches of the yet-unbuilt mansions of Beverly Park Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The latest edition, published this time by Adler, went on sale last month for 
$100 at bookstores and upscale outlets such as Neiman-Marcus. It expands its 
coverage of some of the older homes in Beverly Hills and neighboring high-rent 
districts. But it also features 14 pages of color photographs showing the 
gushing fountains, curling driveways, landscaped vistas and highly decorated 
interiors of homes built in the first phase of Beverly Park. 
</P>
<P>
The first 16 lots were limited in size to flat pads of about one acre each, but 
the next batch of 64 properties, in a man-made bowl below Mulholland Drive, 
will be twice as big -- big enough for almost anybody's dream house, not to 
mention tennis court, guest house, pool and lots of lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most expensive (real estate) brochure ever circulated," said 
Jeffrey Hyland, a Beverly Hills real estate broker who wrote the book with 
Charles Lockwood, an architecture and travel writer. "And the most important 
thing is that no one realizes this is a promotional brochure." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the privately printed, 170-page volume stands on its own merits. Hyland 
and Lockwood, together with researcher Peter V. Persic and photographers 
Randolph Harrison and Baron Wolman, have made a genuine contribution to local 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Their text, based on a combing of old newspaper files and the testimony of 
longtime residents, complements glowing photo layouts of some of the grandest 
chateaux this side of the Loire Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The writers do not hide the pitfalls of living on a grand scale. Some of the 
oil barons and movie moguls who built for the centuries ended their lives in 
poverty, forced to sell out for as little as $200,000 at a time when lavish 
estates were a drag on the market. 
</P>
<P>
But with athletes and entertainers raking in greater earnings every year, the 
market for great houses is a lively one today. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has already sold homes in the remote, gated community to the 
Lakers' Magic Johnson, entertainer Pia Zadora and her multimillionaire husband, 
Meshulam Riklis, and others in the seven-figures-and-up income bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of them learned about it through 'The Estates of Beverly Hills,' but 
mainly it was through word of mouth," said Adler, who has been involved in the 
project since 1979. "I've been very low-key about it, but when the most 
affluent buyers, the ones for whom a few million dollars either way doesn't 
matter, picked us, that's the greatest compliment, because they can be 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when buyers of run-down mansions are confronted with rehab costs of 
$1 million or more, Hyland said, there should be a lively demand for the 
two-acre estates of Beverly Park, where empty lots are going for $3.5 million 
to $5 million and completed houses are expected to cost $8 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing today is big estates," said Hyland, whose firm of Alvarez, 
Hyland &amp; Young is the fourth-largest real estate brokerage in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for us to sell a house for $10 million than for $2 million or $3 
million, (because) there are more people on the high end than on the low end, 
and they'd rather pay you another $1.5 million or more to build a house for 
them than do it themselves," Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
"(The clients) would rather spend the time on their own business, and they 
don't want a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
The authors were especially proud of their entree to the Warner and Kirkeby 
estates, which are concealed behind gates and greenery and have not been 
photographed for public consumption in decades, although the facade of the 
Kirkeby house is known to millions as the home of the nouveau riche Clampett 
clan in "The Beverly Hillbillies" television series. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland and Lockwood said they were besieged by anxious property owners whose 
homes were left out of their chronicle of conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"People would call up and say: 'You've got to put me in this time. I've put on 
a 10,000-square-foot addition,' " Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors spelled out their standards in the foreword: A property must 
have at least 1 1/2 acres of flat land to be considered an estate. The only 
exceptions in the book are the homes from the first phase of publisher Adler's 
development, Beverly Park. 
</P>
<P>
Some famous homes were excluded because much of the surrounding land was 
subdivided and sold off over the years. Others with large grounds did not have 
enough flat land. 
</P>
<P>
In all the Westside, only 31 properties qualified in Beverly Hills, 22 in 
Holmby Hills and 15 in Bel-Air. The book also counts the 64 two-acre lots in 
Beverly Park Estates, which have yet to be built on. 
</P>
<P>
"Omission from this book does not imply that a residence is any less attractive 
or any less valuable than the properties that are featured," Hyland and 
Lockwood wrote. 
</P>
<P>
They also made it clear that homeowners whose dream houses did not make it into 
the second edition will have to learn to live with the ignominy. There will not 
be a third.

BIKE RIDERS IN THE SKY -- PLAN CALLED SAFE FOR ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bicycle riders who risk life and limb to commute to UCLA may one day be able to 
pedal above the madding crowd on a four-lane elevated bikeway. 
</P>
<P>
After six years of study, an environmental impact report has concluded that the 
envisioned two miles of bike freeway, called a veloway (from the Latin velox, 
for quick), can be built without significant harm to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The report represents a significant step forward for what would be the first 
bikeway of its kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Boosters, who packed a public hearing last week, extolled the proposed bikeway 
as a boon to the environment that will draw bike riders who are now daunted by 
traffic on the roads leading into Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"By far the most dangerous thing I do is ride my bike to work," cyclist John 
Wiley said to the standing-room-only crowd of more than 150 at the UCLA Faculty 
Center on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The West L.A. Veloway is unusual also in that the concept and the 13-year 
effort to make it a reality have come from the community, not a public agency. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative route starts at UCLA and heads south through Westwood Village 
along an alley parallel to Gayley Avenue. It crosses the Wilshire 
Boulevard-Veteran Avenue intersection via an overpass, then continues south 
along Veteran and turns west through Westwood Park, where it splits into two 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
One elevated segment goes down the middle of Sepulveda Boulevard to just south 
of Santa Monica Boulevard. The other segment goes west, crossing Sepulveda 
Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway on another overpass to the Veterans 
Administration property. West of the freeway it splits again, with one branch 
heading northwest to connect with San Vicente Boulevard, a traditional bike 
lane to the beach. The other branch goes southwest to connect with Texas Avenue 
near University High School. 
</P>
<P>
Some portions, including the part in Westwood Village, will be at street level. 
The highest point will be the freeway overpass, 24 feet above the traffic. The 
rest of the above-ground segments are planned at 17 feet high and 16 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of cyclists zooming above the freeway has been viewed as a pipe 
dream by some. As UCLA Law School Prof. Michael Asimow observed at the hearing: 
"Everyone scoffed, including myself. 'Come on. This can never be built. This is 
Los Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even the originator of the idea, UCLA Prof. Emeritus Paul Boyer, said he had 
concluded the project was too difficult to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of dogged biking enthusiasts, headed by urban planner Ryan Snyder, 
have stuck with the idea and now find themselves at last in a position to make 
it happen. 
</P>
<P>
But not tomorrow. The environmental impact report still has to circulate to the 
public and the local, state and federal agencies involved. In an effort to keep 
costs down, the bikeway has been routed through public land as much as 
possible, but this means that permits have to be obtained from agencies ranging 
from the Veterans Administration to the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said the estimated $7 million needed to build the veloway has not been 
raised, but he said he is hopeful the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Committee and the city of Los Angeles might fund the bikeway, as they have 
other less ambitious cycling lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Though little opposition was expressed at the hearing, some may surface, 
especially concerning the aesthetics of a structure 17 feet in the air. Snyder 
vows to make the elevated stretches of the veloway pleasing to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I insist they are not going to be ugly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood and a UCLA 
professor, explained that the bikeway is so near and dear to the community, 
it's almost unpatriotic to criticize it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enthusiasm about an alternative to automobiles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That enthusiasm was expressed repeatedly at the hearing, as cyclists touted 
their avocation as a healthy alternative to pollution and traffic and a small 
contribution toward slowing the greenhouse effect by cutting down on the use of 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood homeowner Alan Friedman took the aesthetic issue head on: "Is it more 
aesthetic to have a beautiful veloway or another parking structure?" he asked. 
"I don't think it's even a close test.' 
</P>
<P>
The cost of parking lots was raised too. David Eisenberg, chairman of the West 
L.A. Veloway committee, told the crowd that the cost of the veloway is 
comparable to what UCLA recently spent for 133 parking places. If ridership 
surveys are accurate, the proposed bikeway could draw 4,000 riders a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's show Los Angeles can take its problems in its hands and make a bold, 
innovative solution," Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Though faced with a complex permit process, Snyder said, he is optimistic 
because most of the agencies in question have been involved in the proposal 
from the outset, and virtually all elected officials from Sen. Alan Cranston to 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky have endorsed the veloway in concept. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is the latest official to come on board. A letter from him 
read at the hearing lauded the bikeway as visionary. 
</P>
<P>
If any politician has been the bikeway's angel, it is County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman, who helped secure about $100,000 from the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission for the environmental impact report. He also 
guaranteed the commission its money back if the project does not reach 
fruition. 
</P>
<P>
An initial study of the project costing $67,500 was paid for out of Edelman's 
road funds, UCLA and Caltrans, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
From the mood of the partisans at the hearing, they are ready to move from the 
drawing board to the road. 
</P>
<P>
Asimow lauded the veloway as a "great triumph of citizen action." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's build it," he said.

BROWN DERBY OWNER OWES L.A. $150,000; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: IN A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CITY'S OFF-STREET PARKING PROGRAM, 
OFFICIALS DISCOVERED THAT THE RESTAURATEUR FAILED TO MAKE 20 MONTHLY PAYMENTS 
ON CITY-OWNED PARKING LOT NEAR HIS ESTABLISHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood restaurateur Walter Scharfe owes the city of Los Angeles more than 
$150,000 in back rent for a city-owned parking lot he leased near his renowned 
Brown Derby restaurant, according to a report prepared by the city's Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The city has terminated the six-year-old lease agreement because of the debt, 
and the city attorney's office may take Scharfe to court to collect the money, 
Assistant City Atty. Shelley Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vine Street lot, which is open to the public as well as Brown Derby 
customers, is now being temporarily managed for the city by System Parking, the 
same firm Scharfe had hired to run it. Under the lease agreement, Scharfe was 
required to pay the city $7,500 per month for the 260-space lot, which charges 
$4 a day for parking. 
</P>
<P>
Scharfe acknowledged in an interview last week that he owes the money but said 
he intends to repay the city before the end of the year. He said he 
inadvertently fell behind in payments after the death of his wife, Elisabeth, 
five years ago. Since then, he said, "I just couldn't get the funds fast 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
"Now I think we are ready to get our act together," he said. "I lost sight of 
it. It was stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Scharfe failed to make more than 20 monthly payments to the city 
totaling $170,000, including interest. Since the city discovered the unpaid 
bills in April, Scharfe has repaid $20,000, but Smith said he has made no 
payments since August. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present intention is to review the file, collect as much additional 
information as possible and file a lawsuit to collect the monies if necessary," 
said Smith, who took over the case last month after a city investigator 
reported that Scharfe had stopped making repayments. 
</P>
<P>
Scharfe's debt was the second uncovered during a comprehensive review last 
spring of the city's off-street parking program, which officials say has 
suffered from years of neglect and poor management despite an urgent need for 
additional parking in many areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors found parking lot agreements that had not been updated in two decades, 
that were not competitively bid and that were rarely -- if ever -- monitored by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was watching what was going on," said Alice Lepis, who has headed the 
$1-million-per-year program since April. "That is clearly not the approach we 
like to take in this day and age. We are writing contracts for a shorter period 
of time, and with more oversight." 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, officials revealed that the Los Angeles Business Council, 
headed by city Housing Authority Commissioner Dori Pye, had failed to turn over 
$53,000 it collected while managing a city-owned parking lot in Westwood. Smith 
said the city attorney last month sent a final bill to Pye's group for more 
than $63,000, which includes interest on the outstanding debt. The city has 
also terminated its parking lot agreement with the business council. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation and city attorney have also been looking at 
the financial books of Allied Auto Parks Inc., the firm hired by the business 
group to run the Broxton Avenue lot, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to get the off-street parking program back on track, the City 
Council voted in August to spend more than $400,000 to hire staff and buy 
equipment. In a report prepared for an upcoming meeting of the council's 
transportation committee, Department of Transportation General Manager S. E. 
Rowe said the money will allow the department to correct problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The department now has the staff resources to adequately administer the 
operation and maintenance of the off-street lots under its jurisdiction," Rowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which also identified the unpaid bills owed by Scharfe and the Los 
Angeles Business Council, said the department has instituted several reforms in 
response to problems uncovered in three separate management audits over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the department is requiring detailed accounting of revenues 
by its private operators and is imposing rigid late-payment penalties, Rowe 
said. The department is also conducting regular audits of the parking lot 
operations and is putting all of the agreements through a competitive bidding 
process. The city is currently seeking bids to run the Broxton Avenue lot, for 
example, and it is expected to seek bids for the Vine Street lot early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also conducting random inspections of the lots to verify that 
operators are charging rates dictated by the agreements. Lepis said inspectors, 
for example, discovered in September that the operator of a city-owned lot in 
Venice was charging a weekend daily rate $2 above that allowed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys had been cranking (the prices) up, and they hadn't gotten 
permission," Lepis said. "We have put a stop to that." 
</P>
<P>
The city has also run into criticism for allegedly allowing some of the lots to 
become havens for drug dealing and other crimes -- and poor oversight is being 
blamed for that too. City officials said they have relied on their contractors 
to patrol the lots, but in at least one instance, the contractor of record 
claims to have nothing to do with the lot. 
</P>
<P>
According to city records, the city has leased its lot on Cherokee Avenue to 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce since 1965, but chamber officials said they 
did not realize it until residents on nearby Whitley Avenue recently began 
complaining about drug dealing there. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no paper work on the lot in the files," chamber President Larry Kaplan 
said. "A dollar from that lot has never gone through the doors of this place." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the chamber apparently subcontracted the parking lot in the 1960s 
to Grant Parking, which has been making lease payments directly to the city. 
Complaints about the company's unwillingness to provide more lighting and 
security at the lot have prompted Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo to ask 
that a new contract for the lot -- expected to be up for bid early next year -- 
require better lighting and security. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure that there are strings attached to Grant or any other 
company that may run that lot," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has 2,200 parking spaces in 19 off-street lots leased to private 
operators. Under the expansion approved by the council in August, the city 
plans to add 5,070 spaces in 50 projects over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Scharfe said he will bid on the Vine Street lot lease next spring in hopes of 
reviving a 10-year-old dream to build a hotel on the property. Scharfe 
originally leased the lot, which wraps around the Doolittle Theater near the 
intersection of Ivar and Selma avenues, in 1977 to build a hotel, he said.

SANTA MONICA GROUP SUBMITS 9,000 SIGNATURES ON AIRPORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Perhaps the biggest blow to a large commercial development at Santa Monica 
Municipal Airport was delivered late last week when a citizens group submitted 
nearly 9,000 signatures to the city clerk in a referendum drive to reverse the 
City Council's approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
If at least 5,644 signatures are verified by the county registrar-recorder 
within 30 days, the City Council will be forced to reverse its Oct. 10 approval 
of the 822,000-square-foot project or place the matter on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gilpin, a spokeswoman for the citizens committee that organized the 
referendum drive, said she is confident that enough signatures will be 
certified because about 70% of the signatures submitted were returned by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Because the group had only about two weeks to collect the signatures, petitions 
were mailed to all 56,000 registered voters in Santa Monica. Gilpin said that 
method is a more reliable -- albeit more costly -- way of collecting 
signatures. She said the drive cost about $30,000, nearly all of it raised by 
donations from residents. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, the City Council is likely to call a special 
election in the spring rather than wait until the next regularly scheduled 
municipal election in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If the referendum is certified, the council's approval of the project is 
suspended until the matter is decided by the voters, according to City Clerk 
Clarice Johnsen. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been mired in controversy since it was first announced in 1987 
that the city had selected Reliance Development Group to build a 
1.3-million-square-foot commercial office project on a 37-acre parcel in the 
southeast corner of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
After several public hearings in which residents from both Santa Monica and Los 
Angeles complained of potential traffic problems, the City Council on Oct. 10 
voted 4 to 3 to reduce the project to 822,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a lawsuit was filed challenging the city's authority to approve 
such a development without voter approval, and two Los Angeles City Council 
members have vowed to hold up permits for street improvements in Los Angeles 
connected with the project until all questions about traffic are resolved to 
their satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
But if the referendum drive is successful, the lawsuit and Los Angeles City 
Council members' action would be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin said the campaign could run as high as $200,000 on each side, depending 
on the degree of involvement from the developer, Reliance Development Group in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the developer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane, a major supporter of the project, has vowed to campaign 
vigorously for the development. Zane and three former mayors, including Jim 
Conn, held a press conference two weeks ago urging support for the project 
because of the millions of dollars in revenue it would generate for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Conn, who was mayor last year and campaigned heavily for the project before the 
City Council's vote, said he expects the project to survive a tough campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"When you throw anything into the electoral process, it's usually the best 
campaign that wins," he said. "My hunch is that the project will prevail, but 
it will be a difficult fight." 
</P>
<P>
Conn said he believes many residents will vote against the project as a vote 
against over-development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easier to say 'no' rather than to solve a problem," he said. "But 
if this project is defeated it will not . . . solve long-range fiscal concerns 
. . . or what to do with airport land." 
</P>
<P>
Rol Murrow, president of the Santa Monica Airport Assn., a group of airport 
supporters who recently filed suit to stop the project, said he believes public 
support of the project was lost when the City Council refused from the very 
beginning to place the matter before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people would have supported it if it had been presented in reasonable 
fashion," he said, "but the City Council dropped the ball and citizens are 
going to vote to overturn the decision."

For four weeks, 38 fifth-grade students used paint and brushes to create their 
own images of a parade on three 4-by-8 feet sheets of plywood. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, their moment had come. They gathered at the Pasadena Hilton to see 
the unveiling of the murals, designed and painted solely by the students with 
the direction of Los Angeles Muralist Glenna Boltuch Avila. They used the theme 
Fantasy Parade, depicting parade scenes as seen through the eyes of the 
students, Hilton spokeswoman Marge Gammon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Hilton -- in cooperation with the Adopt-A-School Program, the 
Armory Center for the Arts and the Thomas Edison Elementary School -- sponsored 
the mural painting program, Gammon said. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Thomas Edison Elementary School in Altadena were chosen to create 
the murals to teach them a new art form and to brighten the front of the hotel, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The murals will be on display for about a month, while the Hilton's new lobby, 
lounge and restaurant are under construction. After the renovations are 
completed, the murals may be placed inside the hotel, Gammon said. Luz

VIDEO OF MAYOR CALLED GOOD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have lived in West Hollywood for many years; I am active in city affairs, and 
I'm getting totally disenchanted with the narrow-minded "oppose everything" 
mentality of many of our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a video profile of Mayor Abbe Land is an excellent idea. She is a 
devoted, caring city official. She is dedicated to improving the quality on 
life in our city. She is responsive to the particular needs of our 
demographics; she works hard -- and she gets paid very little. She is not 
running for reelection, so the program cannot be construed as politically 
self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
What could possibly be wrong with a community getting to know its public 
officials better? This innovative idea is so good it should be expanded to 
include the other members of the City Council, our city manager, department 
heads, and key members of the government. Informative sketches such as this are 
completely within propriety and belong on our city channel TV, which exists as 
a "government access" channel. And no, as a taxpayer, I don't object to a few 
of our dollars being spent to produce such material.

AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: PASADENA SYUMPHONY KEYS UP FOR CONCERT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY R. HEFFRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scene: Stage of the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, late in the evening of the first 
rehearsal for the 1989 season of the Pasadena Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Cast: Men and women, casually dressed and sprawled on folding chairs. Maestro, 
in a navy blue shirt hanging out of jeans, standing on a wooden platform. 
</P>
<P>
Props: Violins, violas, cellos, French horns, trombones, trumpets, oboes, 
English horns, bassoons, clarinets, assorted drums, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Action! Maestro jumps, springs, bounces on his platform. He waves his arms 
wildly. The instruments blend, creep, rise, crescendo. Midway, the Maestro 
speaks. 
</P>
<P>
Or rather, clucks. "Cluck, cluck, cluck" he calls, and then, "More bass drum. 
Boomp, bomp, bomp, boomp." At one point, to demonstrate how long a note should 
be held, he leans over, almost falling. 
</P>
<P>
He asks the horns for more tongue. He sounds out what he wants with a throaty 
noise somewhere between a 2-year-old's indigestion and a Bronx cheer. 
</P>
<P>
He hops violently, waving, calling out critiques, asking musicians to play bars 
over. Occasionally, a musician apologizes for a miscue. More often, they 
whistle or call out jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Is this any way to run a symphony? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working with the best musicians in the country," Jorge Mester replies. "We 
can afford to be playful . . . You're playing music, after all. It's supposed 
to be fun. I think a lot of people forget that." 
</P>
<P>
Mester, 54, has been music director of the Pasadena Symphony for six years. He 
recently signed a contract extending his directorship to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his work in Pasadena, he is director of the Aspen Music Festival and 
has been a guest conductor with orchestras all over the world. He has Hungarian 
parents, was born in Mexico and attended a U.S. military prep school. Though 
his wife moved to Switzerland three months ago, Mester has spent barely three 
weeks there. His permanent home, he says, is United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Basel before the symphony's second performance next Saturday, Mester 
talked about the season ahead, which in honor of the French Bicentennial has a 
distinctly Gallic flavor, and about working in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is a lot of things. Rose Bowl, Rose Parade, Doo Dah parade. Craftsman 
architecture, Greene brothers. Old Town, new money. Lake Avenue high rises, 
slow-growth initiative. Little Old Lady From. 
</P>
<P>
What it is not, is a major metropolis. But like a lot of small cities in 
Southern California, it supports a symphony, something that some much larger 
cities -- New Orleans, for instance, and Denver -- have not been able to do 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
Major credit for that goes to Pasadena's location, in the entertainment capital 
of the world. Although many large city symphonies struggle to pay the bills -- 
including living wages to musicians -- Southern California is swimming in 
symphonies, chamber orchestras and other ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that first-rate musicians, who can command top salaries in film 
and television, can indulge their passion for classical music at symphonies 
such as Pasadena's. 
</P>
<P>
Principal horn James Thatcher, for instance, recorded for the films "Indiana 
Jones," "The Natural" and "Star Trek." Concertmaster Paul Shure has been 
concertmaster for the Hollywood Bowl. Trumpet player Burnette Dillon has played 
with Della Reese and rock groups. Percussionist Dale Anderson has done "Ghost 
Busters" and the background music for NBC Network News. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having lunch with my first trumpet last Saturday," Mester said, "and he 
told me (the Pasadena Symphony) is his only chance to play symphonic music. . . 
. It means a lot to them. Very often it's the only classical music they play. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place in the United States other than New York, and the only 
place in the world other than New York and London, where you can do this." 
</P>
<P>
Mester thinks of these virtuoso musicians when he is designing the Pasadena 
season. He considers, too, his audience, which probably will want to hear a 
familiar repertoire. "I realized that the place that the Pasadena Symphony 
should be . . . was to present programs that were unique and would continue the 
tradition of the Pasadena Symphony as an innovative force in Southern 
California. It's important to figure out what musical diet the audience would 
want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
But besides the enjoyment, there must be new discoveries for the audience, 
which is where the orchestra's preferences come in. As Mester says, "I have to 
make sure they're going to have fun and be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a good balance between things that the audience feels familiar 
with and things that will stretch them a little bit." MARY R. HEFFRON

WOULD-BE TOWNHOUSE BUILDER SUES CULVER CITY OVER DEMAND FOR FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A small band of residents and the owner of a defunct Culver City sports club 
have stepped up protests to the City Council for requiring that the owner give 
the city $280,000 for recreational facilities in order to build townhouses on 
the club site. 
</P>
<P>
The owner reactivated a suit against the city, charging that the fee is 
excessive and amounts to a taking of his property without just compensation. He 
also argues that the city has not made proper findings that the townhouse 
development creates a need for recreational facilities, as required by a new 
1989 state law. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Chupack, a representative for owner Richard K. Ehrlich, said the 
litigation will cost nearly as much as what he called the "bogus" $280,000 fee, 
but he thinks he will win. "Any reasonable person would say there's something 
wrong in making (us) pay $280,000." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, however, have maintained that the fee is necessary because the 
development means a substantial loss of recreational facilities to the 
community. Both the council's decision-making process and the decision itself 
were legal and justified, City Atty. Joseph Pannone said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich proposed the 30-townhouse development when he closed the Westside 
Sports Club in August, 1988, after what he said was nearly 15 years of barely 
breaking even. The site, at 4901 Overland Ave., was designated for use as a 
sports club. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council in April rejected the townhouse plan because of concerns over 
the loss of the facilities, which included tennis courts and a swimming pool. 
The council determined that the city could not afford to buy the club because a 
study concluded it could not compete in today's market without major 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich sued in July, saying the city was locking him into an unprofitable use 
of the land. He and Councilman Steven Gourley discussed possible settlements, 
such as the developer's building four tennis courts on city land. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Council reconsidered and approved the townhouses with the 
$280,000 condition. The $280,000 is the approximate cost of building four 
tennis courts at $70,000 each, a figure that the city derived in consultation 
with Los Angeles city and county recreation officials. The council said the 
money was preferable to the developer's building four courts, because the 
council could then choose to build courts, a pool or whatever is most needed. 
</P>
<P>
An amended lawsuit, filed Nov. 3 in Los Angeles Superior Court, asks for at 
least $1 million in damages, which the owner estimates are his incurred costs 
and lost earnings potential from at least August, 1988, when "we were unable to 
do anything," said Ehrlich's attorney, Fred Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines said the City Council violated a state law that orders cities to show a 
reasonable relationship between a development's impact and any imposed fee. The 
law has been raised in suits in other cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the suit is pending, the developer is finishing demolition of the club 
walls. Chupack said he expected to get the city building department's final 
approval of building plans late this year. Construction will take about eight 
months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $280,000 will have to be paid before the city issues certificates allowing 
occupancy of the townhouses, Pannone said. Ehrlich has a letter of credit from 
a bank guaranteeing payment should the city win the suit, said Chupack. 
</P>
<P>
Also thrown into the lawsuit is a challenge to Culver City's law that 
developers install public art or pay into a public arts fund. Ehrlich had 
earlier been willing to pay the fee -- $30,000 in his case -- but "if you have 
$280,000 (to fight), you might as well challenge this too," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
The city "wants us to pay for artwork, (but) there's nothing in the record to 
show that the project creates the need for art, or that our project is not 
aesthetically pleasing," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gourley, however, said the council's findings to justify the fees 
were "certainly . . . adequate." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to soften the impact of the blows to the community and the park 
and recreation facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a win-win situation," Gourley added. "The developer could give 
something to the community and look like a hero. (But) he said, 'I deserve a 
zoning change (from a sports club to a residential use) that increases my 
property value 100%, and the public be damned.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost 1,000 residents have signed a petition to "end extraction 
without due process" said former Planning Commissioner Chuck Blum, who launched 
the drive. The petition asks that the council enact a law to assess fees on 
developers before doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Blum disputed the city's position that the townhouses mean a loss in 
recreational facilities. "The city never had (those) recreation (facilities) 
because it was private property," he said. He said his group of about 20 
residents started collecting signatures in late October and will submit the 
petitions to the council next month. 
</P>
<P>
The petition also demands that the council rescind the $280,000 fee on 
Ehrlich's project, but Blum and the developer said that they were operating 
independently of each other. Ehrlich's case is merely "the first time (a fee 
has been levied) without the benefit of legislation" in Culver City, Blum said. 
"We're trying to head it off before it becomes an inbred practice." 
</P>
<P>
But Gourley said the council's action was part of a new trend. "The old City 
Council was mired in the ideology of the 1950s. This is the 1990s -- anybody 
who is going to develop in Culver City has to pay his fair share and not expect 
the taxpayers to absorb all the costs." 
</P>
<P>
He said that a developer of a movie theater under construction just outside 
Culver City complied with Culver City's requests for parking spaces and with 
the city's sign regulations and paid $200,000 to the city to pay for additional 
downtown parking. The complex at Hughes Avenue and Washington Boulevard is 
technically in Los Angeles. "So if we can ask someone outside Culver City to do 
that, why can't we ask someone in Culver City to do something like that?" 
Gourley said.

Minimum-wage Increase 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 382 to 37, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2710) 
increasing the minimum wage for the first time since 1981, raising it from 
$3.35 an hour to $3.80 next April and $4.25 in April 1991. About 4 million 
workers now receive the federal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the bill is a new sub-minimum wage for youths advocated by 
businesses but disliked by labor. The "training wage," set at $3.35 an hour 
next April and $3.61 a year later, can be paid for up to 90 days to youths 16 
to 19 who are new to the work force. The bill is a compromise between President 
Bush and Democratic leaders, drafted after the House failed last June to 
override Bush's veto of a $4.55-an-hour minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter James Traficant (D-Ohio) said the bill is needed because "it's a sad 
day in America when people work eight hours a day and still qualify for food 
stamps and housing vouchers." 
</P>
<P>
Objecting to the new two-tier wage structure that critics say will take jobs 
away from adults, Carl Perkins (D-Ky.) called the bill "a sellout to the 
President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Airline Takeovers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 300 to 113, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3443) enabling 
the Department of Transportation to prevent the sale of major airlines if the 
deal would result in foreign control of the carrier or enough of a debt load to 
jeopardize passenger safety. 
</P>
<P>
Parties seeking more than 15% of an airline's stock would have to get DOT's 
prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign control of major carriers is now prohibited, federal officials 
say the bill is needed to plug loopholes in the existing ban. The safety issue 
is raised by fears that leveraged buyouts will leave newly purchased airlines 
with insufficient cash flow to maintain their fleets. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) said: "We cannot sit back while airlines, our 
national assets, take on billions of dollars in debt. The risks are too great." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said the bill gives government too much 
power over the marketplace and "is more appropriate for the Soviet airline, 
Aeroflot, not the American airline industry." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the Department of Transportation to be able to block 
certain airline buyouts.

Nicaragua and the Contras 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 262 to 152, the House endorsed the harsher of two possible 
criticisms of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega for resuming combat with 
American-backed Contras. This meant that a measure later passed by the House 
(HR 221) denounced Ortega's Sandinistas but not the Contras for violations of 
the Nicaraguan cease-fire. The vote swept aside a Foreign Affairs Committee 
measure that blamed both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Walker (R-Pa.) said the committee measure "is a little ambivalent about 
whether or not we are condemning the Sandinistas or . . . the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) said the House should denounce both the Sandinistas and 
"the continuing atrocities . . . of the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a resolution criticizing the Sandinistas but not 
the Contras in Nicaragua.

COASTAL STAFF URGES BIG CUTS IN COUNTY'S PLAN FOR MALIBU SEWERS 
</P>

<P>
In what may spell trouble for Los Angeles County's plans to install a regional 
sewer system in Malibu, planners for the California Coastal Commission have 
recommended that the system be sharply reduced before the panel gives its 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, issued last week, disappointed county officials, whose 
$43-million sewer plan for Malibu was rejected by the Coastal Commission in 
September as oversized. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, officials have scrambled to put together a revised plan, which is 
to be presented to the Coastal Commission on Tuesday during a public hearing in 
Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission staff took a dim view of key parts of the county's plan, 
recommending that the system's capacity to serve commercial users be cut in 
half and suggesting that the county's estimates of the capacity needed to serve 
residential users also be reduced to reflect water conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission follows its staff's advice, it would not only put a crimp in 
the county's long effort to install the kind of sewer system officials say is 
needed, but it could also cloud the prospects of a cityhood election in Malibu 
occurring soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a major disagreement," said Harry Stone, the county's deputy director 
of public works, of the recommendation to scale back the system's size. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have long argued that a sewer system is needed in Malibu. They 
say staff studies document a significant public health hazard because of 
discharges from malfunctioning septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
These findings, by the Department of Health Services, enabled the county to 
impose a sewer system over the objections of hundreds of Malibu residents, who 
view the county's plans as a recipe for widespread development of their seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents were elated by the coastal staff's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"As a whole, the staff report is excellent," said Sara Wan, a member of the 
2,000-member Malibu Township Council. "If the commission approves a system with 
these modifications, we will get a system much more in keeping with Malibu's 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
She and other opponents of the county's plans predicted that the changes, if 
approved by the commission, could reduce the size of the system by as much as 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
"What's left would still allow for modest commercial growth, but what it means 
is that developers won't be able to carpet the Civic Center area wall to wall 
with hotels and restaurants," said Mike Caggiano, who serves on a citizens' 
sewer advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision Tuesday could have a bearing on whether the Board of 
Supervisors decides Nov. 21 to set an election date to determine whether Malibu 
becomes an incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu cityhood supporters were angered last month when the supervisors put off 
setting an election. By law, the supervisors have 60 days from last month's 
hearing, or until late December, to set an election date, making it likely 
that, even with the delay, the election will be held in April. 
</P>
<P>
However, several supervisors have indicated that they may seek to delay the 
matter further unless the Coastal Commission approves a sewer system to the 
county's liking. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Stone said public works officials "would have great difficulty" 
recommending to the supervisors that they set an election date if the 
commission approves a downscaled system like the one the staff has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"We're continuing to work with the staff, and we're hopeful that at least some 
of their recommendations might change prior to (next Tuesday)," he said. "I try 
to be optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The county has pushed for a system capable of providing commercial users in 
each of four different categories with capacities of 4,000 gallons of water per 
day per acre. By the same formula, the staff is recommending that the 
capacities be cut to 2,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the county plan view the gallonage as a key issue, saying that 
what the county wants is far in excess of Malibu's present needs and would 
trigger development beyond the limits of the area's 1986 land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the commercial reductions have caused the county a Maalox moment, but 
the sewer has not been stopped, so I see no reason for the county to try to 
illegally prevent an election," Caggiano said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides reducing the sewer system's size, opponents were also pleased that the 
staff recommended removing almost half of the Pepperdine University campus from 
the area's assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say this could help them protest any future attempt by the county to 
expand whatever sewer system is approved. 
</P>
<P>
To mount a majority protest to overturn a sewer plan requires signatures of 
owners of more than 50% of the property in an assessment district. Critics have 
accused the county of gerrymandering the district by including Pepperdine and 
other major landowners known to favor the sewer plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pepperdine's long-range development plans call for only 311 acres of 
the sprawling campus to be developed, the county assessed all 785 acres owned 
by the university, which means that Pepperdine makes up 41% of the entire sewer 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say removing the portion of the campus zoned for less than one 
dwelling unit per acre, as the commission staff has recommended, would leave 
Pepperdine with less than 20% of the district's voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors approved a sewer system for Malibu last January over the 
outcry of hundreds of residents who predicted that it would lead to widespread 
development along the rural coastline. Sewer opponents went to court to force 
the county to obtain Coastal Commission approval before a system is built. 
Meanwhile, residents eager to wrest control of the system from the county 
accuse the supervisors of dragging their feet in setting the date for a 
cityhood election. They say the incorporation effort is being held hostage to 
the sewer plan.

OUTSPOKEN RIGHT-WING RABBI GIVES ORTHODOX JEWS A VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA RIFKIN, Rifkin is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Dov Aharoni is a man of paradoxes. 
</P>
<P>
He rails against what he calls the spiritual emptiness of suburban American 
Jewish life, yet lives comfortably in one of the nation's pre-eminent suburban 
communities, the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He is a ferocious supporter of Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip but admits that the greatest disappointment of his life was his 
unsuccessful attempt to adapt to living in a West Bank settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And although he counts himself among that generation of Americans who came of 
age in the free-thinking 1960s and '70s, his radicalization left him rooted 
even deeper in the authoritarian Orthodox Judaism of his upbringing. Rather 
than burn his draft card, Aharoni played out his days of rage on the streets of 
his native Brooklyn in support of the militant Jewish Defense League. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni arrived in Los Angeles just three years ago, but already his ability to 
turn a phrase and his willingness to take the heat for controversial positions 
has made him the media darling of Los Angeles' growing Orthodox Jewish 
community. The city is home to between 60,000 and 80,000 Orthodox Jews, the 
second-largest concentration in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's essays -- often strident, uncompromising and sardonic -- are 
published regularly in the city's Jewish English-language newspapers, as well 
as on the opinion pages of The Times and other publications, extending his 
influence far beyond his small Woodland Hills synagogue, Beit Hamidrash 
Congregation. Articulate as well as literary, he is also a fixture on the local 
Jewish lecture and debate circuit, his views always to the right of his fellow 
panelists'. 
</P>
<P>
These views run the range of Jewish religious and political issues. "He seems 
to be able to take a position on everything," said Rabbi Jack Simcha Cohen, 
president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni has lambasted the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles for 
earmarking charity dollars for a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood in Israel 
rather than spending it at home on purely Jewish institutions. He routinely 
castigates Conservative and Reform rabbis for their less-stringent standards 
for conversion to Judaism, accusing them of turning the process into a 
money-making endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
He has written disapprovingly of Jewish teen-agers socializing with non-Jews, 
saying it might lead to intermarriage, and he has berated Jews for caring more 
about the homeless and other social concerns involving non-Jews than they do 
about strictly Jewish needs, such as the religious education of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, also Orthodox, said Aharoni is the first visible spokesman of the Jewish 
right wing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he the spokesman for Orthodoxy?" Cohen asked. "No. But there are quite a 
number of people in the Orthodox community who are very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
"Influencing the public is the name of the game," added Rabbi Alan Kalinsky, 
West Coast director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. "A good 
number of us in the community encourage him to publish as often as he can 
because we don't have anyone else who is willing to say it like he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is enamored with Aharoni. Reform Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin of Bel-Air's 
Stephen S. Wise Temple calls Aharoni "knowledgeable, even if I don't agree with 
him on many issues." Zeldin noted that the vast majority of the 600,000 or so 
Jews in the Los Angeles area are Reform, Conservative or secular and "would 
find most of what Rabbi Aharoni says to be anathema." 
</P>
<P>
One Orthodox critic of Aharoni is Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, the highly 
liberal (by Orthodox standards) Hillel Council campus rabbi at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be knowledgeable, but his views on Israeli politics fly in the face of 
Jewish morality," Seidler-Feller said. "Unfortunately, I think he reflects the 
views of a growing number of people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni, boyish-looking at 36, clearly relishes all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional orthodoxy was defensive about its views, but I see no value in 
playing the isolationist and tending to my small flock of followers," he said. 
"I believe in going on the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni insists that he has tempered his tongue considerably since his angry 
college years when he wrote his first book, "Jews for Nothing." In that volume, 
he charged that institutional Christian anti-Semitism is still a dangerous 
reality. Non-Orthodox, suburban American Judaism, he wrote, is a sterile 
religion of "nursing-home owners" that "extols the paganistic bar mitzvah . . . 
a religion of shameful Portnoys, bagels and sonorous ministers." 
</P>
<P>
"Ideologically, I haven't changed one iota," Aharoni said during a recent 
interview in his Woodland Hills home. "But I've mellowed out tremendously. I 
don't use the same terminology now as I once did." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that from an Orthodox perspective, he is a centrist on many 
theological issues. Unlike most ultra-Orthodox rabbis, he allows women to 
attend his religious studies classes and does not shun the non-observant. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni came to Los Angeles following two frustrating years in Israel. He and 
his family moved into a new West Bank Jewish settlement with the intention of 
never leaving. He even adopted a new name, dropping the family name Fisch in 
favor of the Israeli-sounding Aharoni. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Israel with the greatest of ideals," he said. "My commitment to 
aliyah (settling permanently in Israel) was as much as anything my reason for 
becoming a rabbi. And then I got there and one by one I saw my dreams turn to 
puffs of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
In his writing, Aharoni blames his disenchantment with Israel on that nation's 
struggling, socialist-driven economy and overbearing bureaucracy. In 
conversation, however, he admits that his failure to adjust also stemmed in 
large part from his fondness for middle-class American life. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't realize how much we had come to love our American life style," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aharoni's return to the United States was facilitated by a sister who lives in 
Tarzana and put him in touch with Beit Hamidrash Congregation, a struggling 
Orthodox outpost that needed a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, he's fit in like a glove," said Alan Shapiro, Beit Hamidrash's board 
president. "His being so public hasn't hurt either. He arouses people's 
curiosity, and that brings them to our synagogue."

MURREN, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slowly the funicular began its ascent from the Lauterbrunnen Valley, inching up 
a grade so precipitous that even a mountain goat would find the footing 
precarious. While sunlight flashed through evergreens, the cable car strained 
with its load of passengers, en route to a village unlike any other in 
Switzerland. Or was it, I wondered, just a romantic notion that haunted my 
memory, the sentimental reflection of another visit years earlier to a magical 
place. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a peaceful world of verdant meadows and wildflowers spread beneath 
summer skies, and, later, snow-covered peaks as winter performed for 
vacationers in search of serenity. 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway point on this short journey, another car passed, descending to 
the valley below. The funicular moved steadily toward its destination, swaying 
occasionally, its windows framing scenes that belonged on post cards. Or 
perhaps the canvas of a Van Gogh or a Monet. 
</P>
<P>
The air grew thin and pure and refreshing, and cirrus clouds stretched across 
the heavens like chalk on a blue background. At Grutschalp, a mile-high 
station, passengers boarded a narrow-gauge train for the final journey to 
Murren. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as Murren came into focus, it occurred to me that this could be a 
mistake, searching out memories, impressions that burned deep. Might it be best 
to keep such recollections locked securely in the mind and not tamper with the 
passing of time? 
</P>
<P>
Some dreams are best left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
At 5,450 feet, Murren rests on a sheltered plateau in the Bernese Oberland, 
facing the peaks of the Eiger, the Monch and the Jungfrau. Although barely a 
couple of hours by train from Bern, it was, as I recalled, a world divorced 
from the frantic pace of other destinations, a village without cars, crime or 
pollution, a village mantled by snow in winter, its lovely meadows alive with 
wildflowers in summer. 
</P>
<P>
As the train drew to a halt, passengers scattered and old scenes took shape. 
The rail station was as I had remembered it, and just a stroll away the Hotel 
Eiger still faced the magnificent Alpine peak for which it is named, as well as 
the Monch and the Jungfrau. Couples were dining on its terrace, studying this 
village where time has taken a long holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow street twisting through Murren was unchanged; chalets lined each 
side, geraniums flowing from flower boxes while other blooms spilled from 
vintage wine barrels and hollowed-out logs. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped to visit with the village butcher, Andreas Feuz, who confided that 
the population of Murren had shrunk in the years since my earlier visit, from 
503 to 320 souls. "The children grow restless and they leave." 
</P>
<P>
Unless one is a shopkeeper or a farmer or becomes involved in the winter sports 
programs, employment in Murren is scarce, which is a blessing of sorts for a 
village that remains a fantasy in the minds of those who daydream of a world 
without stress. 
</P>
<P>
The market operated by Herr Feuz has been in his family for nearly a century -- 
and he has no intention of leaving Murren, where contentment was the gift of 
his birth. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors away, Frieda von Almen, a 78-year-old widow, occupies Murren's 
oldest house, a chalet-style dwelling that dates from 1660, its yard a 
showplace of spring and summer flowers and a scene during winter that features 
a snow-banked rail fence. 
</P>
<P>
If one is enchanted by peaceful meadows, the melody of cowbells and waterfalls 
and picture-post-card peaks, the memory of Murren won't be easily forgotten. Of 
a morning, the residents hike off to the baker's for apple strudel and Linzer 
tortes and to exchange bits of gossip. The baker's is, indeed, a cozy spot for 
one of those days when snowflakes drift outside. 
</P>
<P>
I asked a farmer how long he'd lived in Murren and he shrugged and replied: 
"Why, always. Yes, all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Affentranger, who operates the Hotel Edelweiss, smiled and gave the same 
reply: "Always." 
</P>
<P>
Although the operator of a craft shop near the Hotel Blumental arrived in 
Murren 25 years ago, those born here still consider him a newcomer. Family 
roots run deep in this little Alpine village. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, families have been here for generations, so there's a 
cohesiveness and a caring for neighbors that those who arrive from the cities 
find refreshing. No one can recall a serious crime, ever, and there's not a 
policeman in the entire village. 
</P>
<P>
In autumn, before the snows fell, I chose Murren because I was searching for a 
quiet and gentle place to unwind. I wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Murren had a scattering of houses as far back as the 1600s, it wasn't 
discovered as a holiday retreat until late in the 19th Century, when 
vacationers arrived by horseback from the village of Lauterbrunnen in the 
valley below, following a treacherous path over which women frequently were 
lifted by sedan chair. 
</P>
<P>
First came the British. By 1910, Sir Henry Lunn had opened the Palace Hotel, 
and European nobility began an invasion. Later, Sir Henry's son introduced 
world-championship skiing, and Murren became the cradle of Alpine racing. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the British hiked to the top of 10,000-foot Schilthorn Peak 
above the village to establish Europe's longest downhill run. Skiers raced from 
the Schilthorn through Murren and beyond to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, a wild 
and treacherous run of nearly eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Inferno, it has become an annual wintertime spectacle, drawing 
competitors from around the world. Earlier, the fastest skier made the run in 
just over an hour. Now, with faster techniques, the race is won in under 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has been discovered, Murren nevertheless campaigns doggedly for 
skiers and summer vacationers. The very attraction that draws those seeking 
solace -- a village remote and without automobiles -- turns off others, those 
who prefer such destinations as Grindelwald and Gstaad, which they can reach by 
road rather than by funicular. 
</P>
<P>
Hope dawned for Murren in the '60s with the completion of Europe's longest 
cable-car hookup. Beginning in the Lauterbrunnen Valley, the 30-minute ride 
passes through three stations, including the one at Murren, to reach the 
towering Schilthorn Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Rotating at the very top of the Schilthorn is an immense saucer-shaped 
restaurant that was featured in the James Bond film, "On Her Majesty's Secret 
Service." Completing a revolution each 50 minutes, it focuses on the Black 
Forest of Germany and Mont Blanc, and provides a stunning sweep of Swiss peaks 
in a panorama unequaled on any mountaintop in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching from the valley to the Schilthorn, the cable hookup is recognized as 
an engineering feat unequaled in Europe. Workmen labored four years to install 
lines that reach the Schilthorn. After that they spent another three years 
creating the revolving restaurant, embedding a webbing of steel poles in the 
mountain to counter the pressure of 120 tons of cable that pulls vigorously 
against the peak, at times resisting gale-force winds reaching up to 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tram travels through Murren -- an option to riding the slower 
funicular -- few get off. They choose instead to view the world from the 
Schilthorn Peak, thus missing Murren's peaceful hiking trails and trout-filled 
streams and, with the passing of winter, meadows that come alive with 
wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Although for the most part Murren remains the little cliff-hanging village I 
recall from my earlier visit, there's a new sports center that features ice 
skating, curling, a couple of squash courts, tennis and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen hotels provide accommodations, with the 44-room Eiger claiming 
four stars. More than a century old, its windows frame Alpine peaks, snowstorms 
and summer's floral displays. 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the village the remodeled Hotel Alpenruh rises only 
steps from the Schilthornbahn cable station, its 26 rooms providing a dazzling 
panorama of the Eiger, the Monch and the Jungfrau. In addition, the Alpenruh 
operates what seasoned travelers describe as one of Murren's finest 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At the 160-year-old Hotel Blumental, guests gather in a rustic bar and take 
their meals in a timbered dining room. Clinging precariously to a cliff that 
falls away to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, the Hotel Edelweiss offers a startling 
view, particularly from a terrace that seems suspended in space. At the 
Edelweiss, 30 rooms are up for bid, each with private bath and beds with cozy 
eiderdowns. 
</P>
<P>
With 46 rooms, the Hotel Murren (once the glitzy Palace) lays claim to being 
the village's largest lodge. Likewise, it's one of the least inspiring, with a 
lobby that provides a sense of faded elegance. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the cable-car station, a sign pointed to Berghaus Sonnenberg, a 
pension set in a meadow beneath the towering Schilthorn. A 30-minute hike, said 
the sign. Perhaps, if one is a jogger. Otherwise, it's a steady 45 minutes 
(without taking a break) entirely uphill but worth the climb, what with a 
setting as peaceful as a cloud scudding through the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
With four double rooms and a couple of 20-bed dormitories, Berghaus Sonnenberg 
is a backpacker's Shangri-La. Indeed, its 30-year-old chef, Brents Horn, 
arrived at the door with a pack on his back and not a franc (or a care) in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Horn, who once slung hash at Lillie's Southern Grill in Austin, Tex., was 
looking for work, and the Berghaus Sonnenberg was in desperate need of a chef. 
So instead of gumbo, burgers and fries, Horn is turning out aelplermagronen, 
which is to say macaroni with ham, mushrooms, cheese and cream, and a 
concoction consisting of dried meat, bacon, salami and cheese. This plus 
outrageously rich desserts that guarantee a substantial hike in the cholesterol 
count. In his beret and metal-rim glasses, Horn appears more an artist than a 
chef -- or perhaps an eccentric musician off on a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
It's a happy hideaway, this pension on the hill. Guests gather on the terrace 
to sip espresso and Swiss wines and to feed the soul with the peaceful scenes. 
Few places on earth offer the tranquility and awesome silence of Berghaus 
Sonnenberg. The world outside its door is a framework of snowy peaks, and dawn 
is accompanied by the melody of cowbells and the song of birds while waterfalls 
spill from the heavens and a stream flows nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Leng of New York City arrived two years ago, and, after falling in love 
with a Swiss, signed on as a waitress at Berghaus Sonnenberg, where guests join 
fondue parties during winter and ski downhill with torches as darkness 
descends. 
</P>
<P>
Half a mile from Berghaus Sonnenberg, Pensione Suppenhalp welcomes guests at an 
old farmhouse with skiing and sunbathing and a symphony of cowbells and distant 
waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Of an evening, after the glasses are emptied, guests stumble off to bed, 
comforted by eiderdowns and blessed by the peacefulness of an Alpine retreat 
that still stirs the soul and haunts the mind . . . long after one takes leave 
of Murren.

At the top of Issaqueena Falls, a narrow path led to a misty nook behind the 
roaring cataract. We reached into the watery curtain with cupped hands, 
stealing a sip before the current cascaded over a dozen rocky ledges to a 
stream 200 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the alcove, the trail veered toward stands of hickory and long-leafed 
pine, clinging to the mountainside before dropping abruptly to follow the 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
I went first, picking my way carefully down the steep path that changed quickly 
from packed earth to slick, ochre-colored clay. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly I slipped. Sliding out of control, I lunged for a sapling and grabbed 
it a few feet before disappearing into a small ravine. 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling to my feet, I skated the rest of the slippery descent. It was worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The falls cut through the sun-dappled forest like a jagged scar of stone 
pummeled by crashing water. It was difficult to hear anything over the din. 
</P>
<P>
Issaqueena Falls was a heart-stopping start to a weeklong journey that my wife 
and I took through the Great Smoky and southern Appalachian mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Using back roads, we made a 170-mile loop through western South Carolina and 
North Carolina. The loop took us through a village on the Appalachian Trail, a 
hamlet renowned for its mountain crafts and several other places that were 
ideal jumping-off points for day-trips to secluded waterfalls, hiking trails 
brimming with wildflowers and rivers for white-water rafting. 
</P>
<P>
Our route skirted the boundaries of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, until 
the end when we plunged into the popular federal reserve for two days of hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Atop an observation tower at Clingmans Dome, a 6,642-foot summit, we admired 
the famous haze that hangs over the ancient peaks. 
</P>
<P>
At Walhalla, a hamlet of 4,000 in South Carolina's northwest corner, our 
guidebooks said the town is named after Valhalla, the legendary garden paradise 
of the gods in Norse mythology. 
</P>
<P>
Walhalla's real beauty, a service station attendant in town told us, was five 
miles up the road at Issaqueena Falls, named for a mythical Indian maiden. 
</P>
<P>
An unobtrusive wooden sign on the right side of South Carolina 28, "Issaqueena 
Falls -- Stumphouse Mountain Tunnel," pointed us down a narrow, winding road to 
a picnic area and the top of the falls, where we started our precipitous hike. 
</P>
<P>
Having survived the treacherous path (vowing never to be caught wearing tennis 
shoes on a clay trail again), we followed the gas station attendant's second 
suggestion and walked up the paved road to the tunnel, a piece of the folklore 
in South Carolina's Up Country. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is a monument to a gallant but futile effort in the 1850s to burrow 
through a mile of granite. After six years of chipping and blasting, the Blue 
Ridge Railroad ran out of money for the project that was to link South Carolina 
to the Midwest. Despite revived attempts in 1876, 1900 and 1940, the tunnel 
remains unfinished but not abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel's constant climate, 50 degrees and 90% humidity, was perfect for 
aging blue cheese. So for 15 years, until the mid-1950s, Clemson University 
aged its commercial brand of blue cheese in it. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the 1,600-foot tunnel, dripping water from the blasted-rock ceiling had 
carved out permanent puddles. The drops echoed in tinny pings off the cavernous 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
As we walked farther inside, the inky blackness sopped up light leaking from 
the entrance. Without a flashlight, we quit after our path dissolved into 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the road, driving up miles of switchbacks, we understood why a tunnel 
through Stumphouse Mountain made sense. The scenery helped soothe our queasy 
stomaches as we passed dozens of flowering dogwoods, peach and apple orchards 
and an occasional pasture with horses basking in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing into North Carolina we entered Cullasaja River Gorge. Along the canyon 
on U.S. 64 are five waterfalls. Our favorite was Dry Falls, which was anything 
but. From the parking lot an easily traversed path curls behind the base of the 
120-foot falls. 
</P>
<P>
A friend recommended that we stay overnight in Dillsboro, N.C., a hamlet of 182 
people known for its artisans, about an hour west of Ashevile, N.C., and due 
north of Walhalla. 
</P>
<P>
Activity in the village revolves around about 50 weavers, silversmiths, 
potters, antique dealers, inns, restaurants and other merchants. Official 
business in Dillsboro is sparse: city hall is open from 8 a.m. to noon on 
Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Walking down Dillsboro's main thoroughfare, Haywood Street, an old-fashioned, 
red Texaco gasoline pump propped up outside Jones Country Store caught my 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the store we discovered a Depression-era time capsule. Antique toy race 
cars, surveying instruments, wooden tennis racquets in their presses, dishware, 
pots and pans and assorted knickknacks hung from hooks, bulged from shelves and 
beckoned from barrels and bins arranged on the worn hardwood floor. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few contemporary pieces in the store was its owner, Marion Jones, 
who greeted us from a rocking chair next to the pot-bellied stove where he was 
smoking a pipe and strumming a banjo. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a 52-year-old former investigator for North Carolina's 30th Judicial 
District, regaled us with stories of cases he'd covered.. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers around here are real nice people," Jones said in his soft mountain 
drawl. "But you steal from them and you're liable to get a britches full of 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
We steered clear of any gun-toting landowners, choosing instead to challenge 
the rapids on one of the region's many mountain rivers. 
</P>
<P>
One goal of our trip had been to canoe or raft some of the region's famous 
rivers. So from Dillsboro we backtracked 25 miles west along U.S. 19 to the 
Nantahala Outdoor Center, one of several companies in the area that lead guided 
river-rafting trips. 
</P>
<P>
Because workers were repairing the dam that controls the flow of the Nantahala 
River, our group of 15 people was shuttled by school bus to the nearby Little 
Tennessee River. 
</P>
<P>
After a briefing that included a stern warning to point our feet up in the 
water if we capsized (to avoid lodging a foot between rocks on the river bottom 
or hitting our heads on rocks), we set out in one- and two-person "ducks," 
10-foot, banana-shaped boats made of reinforced rubber that were better suited 
to navigate the river's rocky, narrow passages than larger rafts. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with double-bladed paddles, our chain of rafts snaked down the gorge. 
From the high-water mark on the banks we could tell that the river was down 
about three feet from its normal level, a stark reminder of the severe drought 
that has gripped much of the Southeast for as long as three years. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife was abundant. A water snake slithered across our bow. A few minutes 
later an osprey angled across the sky. 
</P>
<P>
We floated lazily through calm waters for parts of the two-hour trip, but more 
often we zigzagged through minefields of rocks, many hidden except for a 
telltale riffle. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I developed our own comic routine: Scream at each other to avoid 
the rocks, get stuck on the rocks, push off the rocks with our paddles, and get 
ready for the next assault. What a team. 
</P>
<P>
Our group finally pulled up on the river bank to survey the final run, a raging 
current coursing through a V-shaped narrows. "Just aim for the white water and 
you'll be fine," said our guide, speaking from years of experience to a group 
of nervous novices. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I shoved off, snagged briefly on a rock, then shot through the 
churning white water to the cheers of our fellow rafters. We paddled into a 
calm pool, soaked and sitting in eight inches of water, but exhilarated. 
</P>
<P>
If we found the spirit of adventure on the Little Tennessee, we discovered the 
timeless soul of the Smokies at a small inn in Hot Springs, N.C., a strong 
recommendation from a friend who attended Duke University but sought solace in 
the Smokies. 
</P>
<P>
A 19th-Century tourist mecca whose mineral springs attracted thousands of 
visitors a year, Hot Springs is a sleepy village of 500 that straddles the 
border of North Carolina and Tennessee, 60 miles east of Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
The hub of Hot Springs is Elmer Hall's rambling, two-story Victorian inn just 
off Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a dozen years the inn has been a popular stop for 2,000 hikers a 
year off the Appalachian Trail, which runs down Main Street. It is also a haven 
for students, poets, artists, writers and anyone else seeking the tranquillity 
of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a bearded 51-year-old retired Methodist minister, describes the inn as 
"an alternative place for an alternative kind of people." Most guests we met 
were hiking the 2,100-mile trail, including a few college students, a computer 
programmer and a retired businessman. 
</P>
<P>
In the inn's common rooms, guests sink into overstuffed couches or rockers to 
swap stories from the trail or browse through bookshelves loaded with bird and 
wildflower guides, histories of the Appalachian Trail and books on Oriental 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
All meals are vegetarian and served family-style. Dinner one night was a 
delicious homemade vegetable soup, a huge tossed salad and whole-wheat pasta 
with pesto and fresh chopped tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
From the inn there were several day-hikes that varied in length and difficulty. 
We chose a 10-miler along nearby Laurel Creek, and were rewarded with a 
creekside path fringed with wild geraniums, silverbells, trilliums, iris and 
sweet clover. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow we missed the cutoff back to the inn, and our three-hour nature walk 
turned into an adventure. With the French Broad River on our left, we followed 
the railroad tracks we knew took us back to town. Walking on railroad ties was 
boring but bearable, until we came to a bridge that spanned the river. 
</P>
<P>
We had a problem. The 400-foot-long railroad bridge had no pedestrian walk and 
nowhere to go if a train came, except the swiftly moving river 25 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
We stepped gingerly out onto the tracks. The trick was to avoid looking down at 
the river through the two-foot gaps in the ties (causing instant vertigo) or 
stepping on one of the rotting beams. 
</P>
<P>
We both took deep breaths. The wind whistled through the bridge girders in an 
eerie aria. We were supposed to head back to Greenville the next morning. Would 
we make it? We started out across the bridge. I walked. My wife crawled. No 
trains came. We made it back to the inn just in time for supper. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The best times of year to visit the Great Smoky Mountains are spring and fall. 
The fall foliage colors rival those of New England. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the burst of wildflowers more exuberant than in the Smokies at 
springtime. Great Smoky Mountains National Park's annual wildflower pilgrimage, 
when blooms should be at their peak for photographers and nature lovers, is 
scheduled for April 26-28, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to the Smokies can fly into Asheville, N.C., or Greenville, S.C., 
both of which are served by USAir, American and Delta Airlines. Rent a car and 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
From Asheville, a good route is to drive north on South Carolina 25 to Hot 
Springs. Follow 25 and then U.S. 321 to Gatlinburg, Tenn. Drive south through 
Walhalla and head east to Greenville and the airport there, or continue north 
back to Asheville on back roads or on Interstate 26. Arriving in Greenville, 
follow the route in reverse. 
</P>

GDANSK A SOLID SYMBOL OF POLAND'S PAST, FUTURE

GDANSK, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was adjacent to this city, at a narrow peninsula on the Baltic Coast called 
Westerplatte, that the first shots of World War II were fired, little more than 
half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
The date was Sept. 1, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gdansk has achieved worldwide fame in recent years as the birthplace of 
the Solidarity trade union, Westerplatte, symbolically, remains a significant 
landmark of 20th-Century history. 
</P>
<P>
The monument, modernistic and muscular in appearance, was erected in 1966. 
Towering 82 feet atop a man-made hill, it commemorates the Defenders of the 
Coast. Fresh flowers -- in red and white, Poland's national colors -- adorn the 
monolith's base. Bouquets tied with ribbons are sometimes placed in clefts in 
the sculpted granite. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I visited the peninsula, blossoms quivered in a stiff breeze 
blowing in from the sea. I was joined that morning by flocks of bundled-up 
Polish school kids, who learn early on that Westerplatte has great significance 
in their country's long, often tragic history. 
</P>
<P>
So they listened intently as teachers told them about Maj. Henryk Sucharski's 
gallant stand. 
</P>
<P>
Following a cannon bombardment from the battleship Schleswig-Holstein at 4:45 
in the predawn morning of Sept. 1, 1939, 5,000 Germans stormed Westerplatte. 
Maj. Sucharski's 88-man garrison, hastily reinforced by about 100 volunteers 
from the city, was ordered to hold the peninsula's munitions depot for 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the stubborn defense against impossible odds lasted seven days and 
seven nights, while Poland waited for Allied naval and air force help that 
never came. The world's most destructive war was suddenly under way, and the 
Poles were its first victims. 
</P>
<P>
Why Adolf Hitler chose to attack this place at that time is an entangled 
matter, with strands stretching all the way back to the Treaty of Versailles, 
signed 70 years ago, in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
By treaty mandate, the strategic port city was taken from defeated Germany and 
made an independent state -- called the free city of Danzig -- at the Baltic 
outlet of a 90-mile strip of German territory assigned to Poland. This "Polish 
Corridor" separated East Prussia from Pomerania on Germany's fractured map. 
Hitler's demand for reunification led to the 1939 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
I walked the pathways over grassy stretches and through wooded areas. Sea birds 
swooped and squawked overhead. The vanished garrison's concrete barracks have 
been left as a bullet-pocked, artillery-shattered ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The actual monument to Sucharski and his men is close by: a tank on a pedestal, 
along with a cross and a dark bronze tablet brightened with flowers. Atop a 
tablet perches an eagle -- Poland's ancient, stalwart emblem -- with one wing 
bent low to represent pain in battle. 
</P>
<P>
As I looked and pondered, a girl's voice came from a cluster of teen-age 
students. She was reciting a poem. It is, my companion explained, commemorative 
verse written by Konstanty Ildefons Galczynski and familiar to Poles young and 
old: 
</P>
<P>
 "When the days were fulfilled 
</P>
<P>
 and one had to die in summer, 
</P>
<P>
 straight to heaven, in rows of four 
</P>
<P>
 went the soldiers of Westerplatte." 
</P>
<P>
 Such gestures are not uncommon, for this is hallowed ground indeed, and Polish 
people are emotional and intensely patriotic. On a subsequent visit, I watched 
six old men step into military cadence while heading uphill to the Defenders of 
the Coast monument. Medals hung from their suit jackets. After laying a floral 
wreath, they saluted and then marched back down the hill to conclude their 
silent, private ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in Gdansk told me that Westerplatte's importance to Poland goes beyond 
that fateful first week of September in 1939. It represents defiant resistance 
throughout the war. Hence the powerful symbolism of a monument that stands 
alone, rock-solid and tall, facing the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, my friends also showed me their city, made famous in this decade by 
Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement. Local history, however, precedes 
Westerplatte and the labor unrest of the 1980s by hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case everywhere in Poland, the past is clouded by conquests and 
partitions. Consequently, Gdansk has endured geopolitical identity crises, 
becoming Prussian-German Danzig in 1772 and 1793. It was absorbed into Hitler's 
Reich after the fall of Poland in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been glory days, too. This is immediately apparent in the 
sizeable Old Town sector, clustered between canals, the Motlawa River, 
magnificent gate towers and remnants of medieval walls. 
</P>
<P>
We strolled the pedestrian-only Royal Road, lined with beautifully embellished 
Baroque and Renaissance facades. The route broadens at a public square called 
Dlugi Targ (long market); its narrower continuation is Ulica Dluga (Long 
Street). 
</P>
<P>
At midpoint stands the Town Hall's 260-foot clock tower, built in dark-red 
brick late in the 14th Century, soon after the seaport had joined Northern 
Europe's Hanseatic League of mercantile cities. 
</P>
<P>
Highest prosperity occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries. Gdansk, 
favorably situated at the mouth of the Vistula River, became a Baltic granary 
for rye and wheat, shipped on rafts from the Polish heartland for purchase by 
German, Dutch and Swedish merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Rich burghers acquired mansions with decorative terraces, parapets and curlicue 
gables. They can be seen in pastel rows on parallel side streets, dominated by 
the Church of Our Lady's stern tower. This lofty Gothic basilica -- begun in 
1343 and completed in 1502 -- is said to be the world's largest brick church 
and is the fifth-biggest cathedral in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It takes little more than a casual look around the Old Town to notice numerous 
pale patches in the omnipresent brickwork covering towers, steeples and 
facades. These are vestiges of a massive rebuilding program that began in 1948 
and was substantially completed by 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Gdansk suffered almost total destruction during the war, especially in the 
spring of 1945, when the city became a last-ditch German stronghold against the 
Russian Red Army's advance on Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
And so one learns that the historic district is, remarkably, a meticulous 
reconstruction from rubble -- a powerful assertion that Poland, though battered 
by war, was too tough to die. Restoration work is now under way on the dozen 
granaries bordering the Motlawa River. Granary structures elsewhere tend to be 
squat and drab. Gdansk's were built in the Hanseatic tradition of architectural 
flamboyance. The best is 17th-Century Baroque; another has been transformed 
into a music academy. 
</P>
<P>
Displays and artifacts covering the city's centuries-old history as a port and 
shipbuilding center are on view in the Central Maritime Museum, facing the 
river embankment where sightseeing excursion boats tie up. 
</P>
<P>
The Gothic gate tower that houses this fascinating museum has a past of its own 
-- its built-in wooden crane began hoisting cargo 500 years ago. The river and 
interconnected canals are vital access lanes to the sea, four miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Any reference to shipbuilding in connection with Gdansk must lead to the Lenin 
Shipyard and, in turn, to Solidarity. The yard isn't far from Old Town 
attractions and is easy to find because its dark, angular cranes loom high on 
the skyline. 
</P>
<P>
St. Brygida's is a venerable 15th-Century parish church, but has become far 
better known as a meeting place and sanctuary for Solidarity activists and 
sympathizers. Fiery slogans are familiar sights on the interior courtyard 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
The lean, high, much-photographed Solidarity monument shares blood brotherhood 
with the granite shaft out at Westerplatte. Both, after all, commemorate 
resistance against numerically superior powers. Situated just outside the 
shipyard's Gate 2, this newer memorial consists of three steel beams, each 
rising 140 feet to form three crosses at the top. 
</P>
<P>
The mound covering the base of the emotionally charged, stark but oddly 
beautiful structure is festooned with flowers as well as banners, ribbons, 
coins and school badges, even religious medals, rosaries, handwritten poems and 
prayers, along with votive candles whose dots of flame flicker in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
I looked up at the crosses on an afternoon when glinting sunshine turned the 
beams to silver. Dedicated in December, 1980, the monument honors 27 protesters 
who died exactly a decade before, killed by police during Gdansk's "bread 
riots." 
</P>
<P>
Nuances are the tower's real strength. Purposely lacking any arty pretensions, 
it looks the way it was built: shaped and welded by local laborers. Three 
anchors hanging below the crosses could easily be interpreted as symbols of the 
dingy shipyard where the independent trade union Solidarnosc was organized 
during a 17-day strike in August, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact they go back 45 years into the depth of Poland's wartime trauma. An 
anchor, symbolizing hope, was the insignia of the underground Home Army that 
launched the Warsaw Uprising against German occupiers in August, 1944. In terms 
of utterly courageous resistance, nothing in Polish history can match that 
63-day battle to the death. 
</P>
<P>
Inbred emotional fervor gives typical Poles a talent for dramatic flair. I was 
mindful of this when one of my Gdansk friends shared with me her memory of the 
Solidarity monument's 1980 dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Government and church dignitaries were present, for this was meant to be a time 
of national reconciliation during the fragile hiatus preceding martial law, 
imposed 12 months later. An orchestra and chorus performed an oratorio to the 
dead by Polish composer Krzystof Penderecki. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a synchronized wail of whistles, horns and sirens from the shipyard, 
autos, outlying factories and ships on the Vistula. With a welder's torch, Lech 
Walesa lit the eternal flame. 
</P>
<P>
My friend recounted this as we sat in a kawiarnia (coffee house). For the 
Poles, this is a favored haven for relaxation and gossip. The best of them -- 
and there are several in central Gdansk -- have a quiet, intimate, prewar 
European atmosphere enhanced by dim lighting and dark, carved woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
In fair weather, cafe proprietors set up tables beneath tulip-shaped umbrellas 
on the Long Market pavement. They're placed beside the 17th-Century Neptune 
Fountain, with watery reference to this city by the sea and perhaps the finest 
classical statue in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Patriotism becomes audible each hour throughout the day. Bells in the Town Hall 
tower clang out the pigeon-scattering notes of an anthem called Rota (the 
Oath), written in 1908 to honor Polish territorial resistance in nearby 
Prussia: 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall not yield our forebears' land 
</P>
<P>
 Nor watch our language muted; 
</P>
<P>
 Our nation is Polish and Polish our fold . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But brooding about past struggles is not a national obsession. Poles have 
always managed to escape into their rich, exuberant culture. Thus the Wybrzeze 
Theater, located alongside the walls on the Old Town's perimeter, is widely 
acclaimed for artistically bold, nationalistic productions. Packed houses are 
the norm in Gdansk's futuristic glass-and-brick performing arts center, home of 
the Baltic Philharmonic, State Opera and a brilliant ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
Begun by Cistercian monks in the 13th Century, the cathedral in suburban Oliwa 
predates partitions and the severest wars. Though Romanesque on the outside, 
its prized feature is an 18th-Century rococo organ with 7,826 wooden and pewter 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
During daily recitals, hymns boom out, accompanied by sounds of trickling 
water, twittering birds, howling wind and tinkling bells rung by mechanical 
angels. 
</P>
<P>
I also toured a hilly "Polish Switzerland" lake district where Kashubians live. 
The Kashubs are a durable breed of northern Poles who have preserved their 
distinct Slavonic dialect and traditions throughout national upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
Wydzydze Kiszewskie, 40 miles inland from Gdansk, is a vibrant, full-fledged 
folk center with ethnic Kashubian crafts, food, music and farm-village 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
And so, despite the blitzkrieg and conquest of 1939, despite limitations on 
freedom during the subsequent 50 years, the Polish spirit lives on.

LOT Polish Airlines has scheduled nonstop service to Warsaw from New York and 
Chicago. Pan Am is the only U.S. carrier with service to and from Warsaw. New 
York's Kennedy Airport is the gateway with connections in Frankfurt, West 
Germany. Flights between Warsaw and Gdansk via LOT domestic service are 
frequent; travel time is one hour. LOT now flies wide-body Boeing jets across 
the Atlantic.

Hotels managed by Orbis, Poland's largest travel organization, have 
consistently good standards of quality. There are seven in the vicinity of 
Gdansk, including two -- Hevelius and Monopol -- which are close to the Old 
Town. The Orbis Marina in suburban Jelitkowo is an alternative for those 
preferring a resort close to Baltic beaches. Double-occupancy rates are per 
person for all three hotels are approximately $62 U.S. in summer and fall, $42 
in the low-season winter period. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a passport, U.S. citizens need a visa to enter Poland. The fee for a 
single-entry visa, good for up to a 90-day stay, is $18. Visa applications are

TRAVEL VIDEOS: JOURNEYS THAT ARE PICTURE PERFECT;

VIDEOS: PICTURE PERFECT TELEVISION TRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this month's selection of videos, travelers can picture themselves 
sunbathing on the beach at Acapulco, visiting George Washington's home or 
strolling through the streets of Florence, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"ACAPULCO" (Travelview International, 1988, 50 minutes). This is a colorful, 
fast-paced preview of interests for the first-time visitor to see and do in 
this Mexican resort. 
</P>
<P>
The video is in three parts. The first provides a panoramic view of Acapulco 
Bay, with its string of high-rise hotels and beaches, from high on a hill at 
historic Ft. de San Diego. This is followed by a closer look at some of the 
activities on Revolcadero, Condessa and Puerto Marques beaches, including 
horseback riding and parasailing. Also seen are fishermen on a deep-sea fishing 
trip, scuba divers on a jaunt to Roqueta Island, water skiers at Cayuca Lagoon 
and a beautiful sunset from Pie de la Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
For a taste of Old Mexico the video takes viewers to the Zocola (central 
square), cathedral and mercado, and includes shops of local artisans, a 
party-boat tour of the bay, a trip to watch the famous Quebara cliff divers and 
a drive down the splendid Costera Miguel Aleman, the main street on Acapulco 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
There also are kaleidoscopic scenes of Mexican rodeos, bullfights and 
festivals, plus scenes of diverse nightclubs, discos and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The second segment contains interior and exterior scenes of some of the major 
hotels and their amenities, and takes the viewer into some of the elegant 
shops. These are not paid commercials. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, however, there's a break for real commercials -- airlines, 
buses, rental cars, etc. It's a disconcerting break that would be more 
appropriate at the end of the video, where a plug also is given for the hotel 
that housed the video's film crew. 
</P>
<P>
Part three is devoted to travel tips furnished by Berlitz travel guides, 
including information on tourist cards, transportation, currency, shopping and 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is good and the narration informative. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Travelview International, 5630 Beverly Hill, Houston, 
Tex. 77057, toll-free (800) 325-3108. Price: $29.95.

"MOUNT VERNON" (Finley-Holiday Films, 30 minutes 1989). This is one of a series 
of Finley-Holiday videos on travel destinations in the United States. It's 
beautifully filmed and will be of special interest to the armchair traveler or 
for reminiscing. It has no tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The narration is informative and nicely blends description with history, 
biography and quotations from George Washington that illustrate what life was 
like for the gentleman-farmer-President more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
An aerial view locates the estate overlooking the Potomac River, and the video 
then takes the viewer on a tour of the home, pausing at some of the family's 
personal items and mementos, including a key to the French Bastille that was 
given to Washington by Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
The bedrooms are shown, including those used by Martha's two children and by 
the Washington grandchildren. Also seen are the west parlor where the family 
portraits hang, and the small dining room where the family ate. 
</P>
<P>
The outbuildings include the spinning room, laundry, pantry, kitchen, scullery, 
slave quarters and cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The video also visits the vegetable garden and greenhouse, and focuses on the 
broad piazza, designed by Washington, that extends the length of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the interior, there are scenes of the library with a Windsor chair 
that has a fan propelled by foot pedals; the bedroom where Lafayette stayed; 
the little parlor with its harpsichord; the large dining room, and the garret 
bedroom in which Martha slept after the death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The film closes with views of the tomb of Martha and George, and of the 
fife-and-drum corps that performs there on the anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Finley-Holiday Films, Box 619, Whittier, Calif., (213) 
945-3325. Price: $29.95.

<P>
"FLORENCE" (World Video Travel Guide, 40 minutes, 1986). This relatively short 
video will whet the appetite of art lovers and, to a lesser degree, gourmands. 
For Florence is not only known as "the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance," 
but is also given credit for the invention of the fork. 
</P>
<P>
The tour opens in Pisa, the site of the largest airport in Tuscany, with scenes 
of the Leaning Tower and some early Roman ruins, before heading for Florence, 
45 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
Street scenes of Florence show some luxury hotels, smaller pensions, coffee 
bars and shops, before the tape zeros in on Florence's most recognized landmark 
-- the huge Duomo and its stained-glass windows by Ghiberti. 
</P>
<P>
The film and narration illustrate the contributions of the Medici family during 
the Renaissance, and give tantalizingly brief glimpses of some of the works of 
such noted Italian artists as Bernini, Luca della Robbia, Donatello, 
Michelangelo, Fra Angelico and Cellini, as well as views of the buildings that 
house their works -- the Bargello, Pitti Palace, Santa Croce Church, San Marco 
Convent and Uffizi Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from traditional art, food lovers get a taste of the culinary creations 
of a number of restaurants. The video then visits the straw market and shops 
selling brass, leather, glassware, silk, embroidery, antiques, books and a shop 
on the Ponte Vecchio specializing in Florentine gold. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion also is an art form in Florence, and there are scenes of fashion shows 
and elegant shopping streets. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Florence, viewers visit the Chianti vineyards and wineries, San 
Gimignano with its cobblestone streets and famous frescoes, and the color and 
pageantry of the Palio festival in Siena, before returning to Florence for a 
kaleidoscopic view of some of the city's nightlife and for some misty scenes of 
the Arno River and its bridges. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is good and the narration informative. There are no tips or 
travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from World Travel Guide, 536 West 29th St., New York 10001, 
(212) 563-1690. Price: $19.95.

When Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore in 1819 he set up separate 
residential areas for the various ethnic groups who came to work in the rapidly 
developing colony. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Singapore's population is a well-integrated mix of British, Chinese, 
Indian, Malay and Arab citizens, but the ethnic neighborhoods still stand as an 
integral part of the city's political, cultural and commercial life. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown, Little India and Arab Street, in particular, feature stores in which 
souvenir hunters can acquire merchandise not sold in department stores or on 
main shopping strips. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown, bounded by Cross Street and Cantonment, New Bridge and South Bridge 
roads, is the largest of these ethnic neighborhoods, with vintage two-story 
buildings that contain shops on the ground level and residences above. 
</P>
<P>
On Smith Street, Chua Guan Hong Kee (No. 2) sells inexpensive cloisonne bangles 
(from $1), silk pincushions surrounded by little dolls ($2), oversize paper 
fans with painted scenes of the Chinese countryside (from $5), glass-encased 
miniatures of country scenes made of bamboo (from $4), embroidered country 
scenes on small squares of silk (from $3), kites (from 50 cents), dragon clocks 
(from $4), rice baskets (from $5) and rickshaws. 
</P>
<P>

$4), sandalwood fans (from $2) and a wide variety of joss sticks with unusual 
fragrances (from 50 cents). 
</P>
<P>

with traditional floral patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Teck Soon Medical Hall (No. 22) specializes in various traditional Chinese 
medicines, herbs and spices, including a variety of ginseng. Chrysanthemum tea 
(50 cents a bag) is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Chuen Cheong Food Industries (No. 30) makes and sells Tiger Brand Soy Sauce as 
well as rice vinegar, Chilli Sauce, salted plums and canned soy beans. Each 
costs about 50 cents per mid-size container. 
</P>
<P>
Fook Weng (No. 34) sells religious goods, including colorful large hand-painted 
paper items (dragons, automobiles, butterflies and other items) that are burned 
during Chinese religious ceremonies. They cost 50 cents and up, and can be used 
as decorative mobiles. In addition, there are candles (from 25 cents) and 
richly-scented joss sticks (from 20 cents per packet). 
</P>
<P>
On Trengganu Street, Kuan &amp; Meng (No. 13) sells decorative oversize fans 
(from $6) of gold paper or silk that are made north of Beijing. Seng Hup (No. 
24) specializes in pottery, including hand-painted plates (from $2), ceramic 
baskets with metal fittings (from $8), tea sets with five cups (from $2.50) and

(No. 261) sells 22-karat gold jewelry for the daily price per gram of gold, 
plus a nominal labor fee. Jade and gold bracelets cost about $125 and up. 
</P>
<P>

pots decorated with sculpted dragons and tree branches for 75 cents to $5. 
</P>

Little India, the area around Serangoon Road, dates from 1825, when Indian 
workers came to Singapore to construct roads and bridges. The area has temples, 
restaurants and shops that sell everything Indian from saris to garlands of 
delicate fresh orchids, from curry powders to peacock feathers. 
</P>
<P>
P. Govindasamy Pillai (48/50 Serangoon Road) is a huge general store. On the 
ground floor are foodstuffs, including coveted spices such as saffron (about 50 
cents per gram) and turmeric (about 10 cents for 125 grams) and prepared curry 
powders (about 20 cents per 125 grams), as well as lentils and beans, flours, 
bread mixes and other items for Indian cuisine. Also, typical cooking utensils 
and pots and pans used in Indian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, the shop features silks for saris. The staff is knowledgeable about 
the origins of the distinctive fabric designs, which range from cheerful plaids 
from Madras to printed silks from Kashmir to bright colors bordered with gold 
floral or geometric embroidered patterns from Varanasi. There are lightweight 
silks that drape beautifully and raw silks that wear well. 
</P>
<P>
Sari-size lengths of fabric (usually about six feet by 44 inches wide) cost 
from about $20 to hundreds of dollars for finer silks with embroidered borders. 
The selection is varied, and the staff is patient in showing the fabrics and 
giving lessons in sari wearing. Naturally, the fabrics also can be used to make 
Western-style garments. 
</P>
<P>
Several shops on Campbell Lane should not be missed. Durga Store (No. 2) sells 
sweet-scented garlands of sandalwood for 50 cents and up, as well as carved 
prayer beads (from $9), attractive cotton midriff blouses (from $8) to be worn 
with saris or shorts, hair clips festooned with silk flowers (from 75 cents) 
and peacock feathers (10 for $1.50). 
</P>
<P>

polyester or silk for making saris or other garments. Prices 50 cents per 
meter. 
</P>
<P>
Thandapani Co. (No. 16) is known for selling high-quality exotic spices and 
condiments such as rare chili peppers, coriander seed and tamarind paste. 
Vishnu Music Centre (143 Dunlop St.) offers all the latest hits from India, 
including Asha's love songs in Hindi and S. P. Bala's songs in Tamil. Cassettes 
cost 50 cents to $2. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Arab Street (and the surrounding area bounded by Beach and Ophir roads, 
Victoria Street and Jalan Sultan) is dominated by the Sultan Mosque. This 
Muslim district is inhabited mostly by Arabs, Malays and Buginese. Area shops 
specialize in baskets, batik and prayer rugs. 
</P>
<P>

selection of decorative baskets (from $2) with wildly patterned weaves, plus 
those shaped like parrots or other animals (from $4), and carryalls (from $2) 
of all sizes and shapes, wicker chairs, tables and lamp shades.

HER WORLD: STOPPING TO SNACK HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, the author of California (with Dewitt Jones), is a La 
Jolla travel writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is more to life than snacking, some say. I submit there is also less. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever I wander, I delight in finding a cafe or bistro in which to enjoy a 
cup of coffee and a nutritious nibble. I especially like places with atmosphere 
close to my day's destination. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I favor a coffeehouse called Odinn a block off Dam Square in central 
Amsterdam. I was led there by a handsome black cat, which started to cross my 
path but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber music -- mostly Mozart -- was playing in the background. Ceiling fans 
turned slowly in front of old gilt mirrors. My husband ordered a Heineken; I 
chose a mug of rich coffee with thick Dutch cream. Amber lights glowed near the 
dark wood bar. Conversation was at a murmur. 
</P>
<P>
I chose a small plate of brown bread and cheese and read the list of tempting 
sandwiches and omelets. Odinn's is in a narrow pedestrian passage called 
Zoutsteeg. It shares the block with arty poster shops and a sweet-smelling 
bakery. 
</P>
<P>
A tempting spot on Dam Square (which the Dutch call "Dam") is the cafe in the 
Nieuwe Kerk, the "New Church," whose origins date to the 15th Century. A 
carillon of bells plays every half hour, day and night. Recitals on its 16th- 
and 17th-Century organs add to the mood. 
</P>
<P>
Small candles glow in white crystal globes on each table. On warm days there is 
dining outside under umbrellas. People-watching can fill hours. 
</P>
<P>
Church suppers and lunches have caught on in much of Europe. One of my favorite 
such restaurants is in the vaulted basement of St. Martin-in-the-Fields by 
London's Trafalgar Square. The food is tasty, the price is right and the 
location makes it convenient for before- or after-theater snacks. A bookshop 
and brass rubbing center share this historic site. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby Soho restaurants continue to bring raves from London friends. A savvy 
critic just wrote that she is mad for Sutherlands on Lexington Street and Burts 
on Dean Street. I can hardly wait to check for myself. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite snack in England is a traditional ploughman's lunch: a chunk of 
English Cheddar or Stilton, fresh bread and butter and adornments such as 
celery, tomato, pickled onion and chutney. Fancier pubs add options such as 
farmhouse pate or prawns. 
</P>
<P>
In Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, though possibly first in spirit, I 
followed local advice to Peppe's Pizza, about 150 feet from the flower and fish 
markets at the harbor. Peppe's is off a dark timber corridor behind a famed row 
of gabled houses begun in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the Hanseatic 
League of northern ports ruled the waves of trade. 
</P>
<P>
As I left Peppe's, a downpour hit. I took tea in the lobby of the SAS Royal 
Hotel, whose architect incorporated the pitched roof lines of the Hanseatic 
style. A framed poster in a hotel shop glittered with gilt raindrops that 
pelted a coastal forest and town. Its ecological plea was perfect for 
drizzle-prone Bergen: Save The Rain. 
</P>
<P>
For snacking on a meal-size level, I would go back to the smorgasbord of the 
Bulls' Eye cafe at Bergen's classic Hotel Norge. This cozy eatery is named for 
the famed Norwegian violinist Ole Bulls, whose statue stands in a little park 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
In America there are few better brisk-weather pick-me-ups than fresh-baked 
gingerbread and a cup of steaming cider from the kitchens off Duke of 
Gloucester Street in Colonial Williamsburg, Va. Shops throughout the restored 
village sell copies of old baking forms, as well as 17th-Century recipes for 
mulled ciders and spicy herb teas. 
</P>
<P>
And across another ocean, in Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii, I succumbed to 
macadamia nut cookies at Suzanne's Bake Shop (open seven days a week), across 
from the ocean-front garden of the governor's palace on Alii Drive. 
</P>
<P>
I view snacking as a worthy part of travel research. How better to check on 
local tastes? 
</P>
<P>
One morning when I was browsing in the bookstore/coffeehouse of Upstart Crow in 
San Diego's Seaport Village, I heard myself order a slice of apple pie with a 
mug of autumn mocha. The work never stops . . . even 15 miles from home! 
</P>

BARGAIN CORNER: FIRMS OFFER INEXPENSIVE PUB STAYS IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Pubstays and Backpackers Headquarters have lined up inexpensive 
accommodations at about 100 pubs in Australia, including some in Sydney, 
Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart. Many of these pub/hotels are old 
buildings that have seen much of the country's history. Some have been 
upgraded. Most offer from five to 10 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
There are four room categories, with varying degrees of comfort. Two categories 
lack private bathrooms. All, however, include a full breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Pub stays can be booked through U.S. tour operators, Guthrey's Pacific Travel 
and Continental Newmans Vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrey's Pacific is offering the pub stays at from $32 to $60 double, $24 to 
$52 single. Guthrey's sells the pub stays only if participants also make other 
arrangements through it, such as car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Newmans is selling vouchers for the pub stays. A minimum of five 
vouchers must be bought, with the rates $28 to $60 single and $37 to $69 double 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Making reservation for the first night's stay -- always a good idea -- can be 
done in the United States. You also can book all five or more nights. The 
vouchers are good for six months. Refunds are given for unused vouchers, minus 
a $50 administrative fee. 
</P>
<P>
Dormitory-type hostels with multiple bunks are used by Backpackers 
Headquarters, with a rate of $8 a night. The hostels usually contain communal 
kitchens, dining rooms, bathrooms, TV lounge and laundry room. Currency 
exchange and tour information/bookings are among the services offered. 
</P>
<P>
There are five hostels in Sydney and one each in Port Macquarie and on Magnetic 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on Australian pub stays, contact travel agents, Guthrey's 
Pacific Travel at (714) 752-8322 or Continental Newmans Vacations at toll-free 
(800) 525-2560. Backpackers Headquarters is at 79 Bayswater Road, Sydney. 
</P>

I kept staring at the map (accompanying Geoffrey Dean-Smith's article: 
"London's Little Known but Lush Lodgings") and wondering what on earth was 
wrong, when I discovered that Piccadilly Circus was west of Green Park instead 
of east.

Congratulations on yet another highly enjoyable issue. My wife and I took great 
pleasure in the article by Nick Clooney ("Memories Are Made of This"); we 
especially enjoyed Jerry Hulse's story ("Sheer Grace: A Visit to Madewood, 
Queen of the Bayou") and found "Lunar Holiday" by Willis Player to be 
particularly fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
But we both really got a kick out of "More Than You'll Ever Need to Know About 
Malta" by Alphonse Normandia. We are planning a vacation in Italy next spring 
and will now certainly include Malta as a side trip. 
</P>
<P>
The picture article was not only informative but amusing and sophisticated in 
its approach as well. We hope these picture stories will be a regular feature 
from now on.

Rita Ariyoshi's tantalizing article on posh Hawaiian vacations ("If Cost 
Doesn't Count") had me drooling all the way to the 7-11 for a couple of Quick 
Picks. Fifteen hundred dollars a night for a prime suite at the Westin Kauai is 
one way to go, but I'll have to agree with Ariyoshi that the best vacation on 
Kauai is in a rented beach house on pristine Hanalei Bay, where nature's beauty 
is endless -- and priceless.

FREEDOM'S DOOR SHUT IN FACE OF SOVIET JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sanford J. Ungar, Sanford J. Ungar, dean of the School of Communication at 
American University, is working on a book about the immigrant experience in 
America since World War II. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, the United States told the Soviet Union that if Moscow hoped 
to enjoy friendlier relations -- or significant trade -- with Washington, it 
would have to allow many more Soviet Jews to emigrate to the country of their 
choice. During the past year, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has essentially met or 
exceeded this longstanding U.S. demand. Yet Washington began to restrict 
severely the number of Soviet Jews it would admit -- and hardly anyone 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting situation is a paradox fraught with political irony and human 
tragedy. It demonstrates Washington's inability to replace rhetoric with action 
when an unexpected and unaccustomed foreign-policy success comes along. It 
tests the mettle of the leaders of the mainstream American Jewish community, 
which may not be as prepared to pick a fight with Washington or Jerusalem as it 
was with Moscow. And it creates another source of tension between the United 
States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The primary losers, meanwhile, are the people whom American politicians claimed 
they were trying to help -- Soviet Jews. Some are stranded "in transit" in the 
potentially hostile environment of Austria. Since they have Israeli visas and 
cannot get American ones, others may find themselves in West Bank settlements, 
where they will be unwitting targets of the Palestinian intifada. Still more, 
after weeks or months of standing in line, have no hope of even an interview 
with a consular officer at the U.S. embassy in Moscow for at least another 
year. While the State Department has proposed a large increase in the consular 
staff, the added personnel probably couldn't make a significant dent in the 
present backlog of 30,000 applications. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of this sad predicament lies in an amendment to the 1974 U.S. trade 
bill. Sponsored by the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.) and Charles A. 
Vanik, then a Democratic congressman from Ohio, the amendment offered the 
Soviet Union "most favored nation" trade status if Moscow relaxed its 
emigration policy. By doing so, Congress injected a new element of idealism 
into U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackson-Vanik," before and after passage, enhanced the political reputations 
and campaign treasuries of Republicans and Democrats who attacked the Soviet 
leadership's callousness toward a long-suffering Jewish minority. Within the 
American Jewish community, it spawned the new battle cry of "Free Soviet Jews" 
and became the basis for fresh political action. Indeed, the "refusenik" -- a 
Soviet Jew denied permission to emigrate to Israel or other countries -- 
emerged as a new international symbol of repression. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the Jackson-Vanik amendment worked well for a time. Leonid I. 
Brezhnev, the late Soviet leader, was willing to swallow his irritation and 
make concessions to gain trade advantages. In an extraordinary series of 
negotiations concluded in October, 1974, the Ford Administration and the 
Soviets, under pressure from Jackson and congressional allies, agreed that "no 
unreasonable or unlawful impediments" would be placed in the way of persons 
wanting to emigrate. Equally important, those who applied would not be punished 
for trying to leave the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Soviet Jewish emigration steadily rose. In 1979, 51,000 Jews -- an 
all-time high -- were permitted to leave. More than half came to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
But during Brezhnev's last years and under the caretaker regimes that preceded 
Gorbachev, the exodus diminished sharply. The record was especially bleak 
during Ronald Reagan's first term as President. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, all this has changed. In 1986, his first full year in power, 
only 1,900 people, 900 of them Jews, were allowed to emigrate; 641 came to 
America. A year later, more than 8,000 Jews were permitted to leave, with 
nearly 6,000 coming here. And in 1988, almost 19,000 left, 13,000 of whom ended 
up in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Soviet Jewish emigration is expected to reach 48,000. The number for 
August alone -- 6,756 -- was the highest monthly total in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Now the problem is at the American end of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement that Soviet emigration reform has matched U.S. 
expectations and probably won't backslide. Accordingly, a one-year trial waiver 
of the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions has broad support. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, 1988, the State Department dropped its longstanding 
presumption that Soviet Jewish emigres qualify as refugees. Those seeking 
admission to the United States, it decreed, would be considered on a 
case-by-case basis, following individual interviews. One result, according to 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is that the latest Soviet 
applicants have had more trouble demonstrating a "well-founded fear of 
persecution," a prerequisite for being granted refugee status, because of 
favorable changes in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration policy has seemed contradictory. On one hand, it proposed 
creation of a new category of "special immigrants" whose admission "is deemed 
for foreign-policy reasons to be in the national interest." For the next five 
years, 30,000 special visas would be offered annually, many presumably going to 
Soviet emigres. On the other hand, the Administration quietly developed an 
interagency plan to cut back on the number of Soviet Jews admitted as refugees; 
those without relatives, for example, will be automatically excluded. (About 
half the Soviet Jewish applicants are expected to fall in that category.) 
</P>
<P>
Although officials have not been eager to discuss the plan, various 
explanations can be found in certain State Department documents: that Soviet 
Jewish refugees, who cost about $7,000 each to transport and resettle here, 
have become too expensive; that Soviet spies may be among a new tide of 
emigres, and that it would be better for more of the Soviet Jews to go to 
Israel, perhaps on direct charter flights from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Bush Administration coordinator for refugee affairs, Jewel S. 
Lafontant, told Congress in September that 5,000 Soviet Jews now stranded in 
Austria and Italy could "always go to Israel or return to Russia. In these days 
of glasnost, that's not an impossible thing." A day later, Lafontant said that 
her remark had been "misunderstood." Undersecretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger said it in no way suggested that Soviet Jews should go home. Yet, 
the incident highlighted the disarray in Administration policy on Soviet Jews.) 
</P>
<P>
A State Department report acknowledges that even if official anti-Semitism has 
abated in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev, the country's 2 million Jews still 
face severe discrimination. Extreme prejudice has also surfaced among members 
of grass-roots nationalist organizations that have revived during glasnost. And 
once potential emigres have announced their desire to leave the Soviet Union, 
their lives there have been permanently disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
All this has failed to stir much public outrage in this country. The House of 
Representatives, to its credit, overwhelmingly passed a bill in July giving 
Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians nearly automatic refugee status for a 
year, but the Bush Administration opposes it. American Jewish organizations 
have not repainted the "Free Soviet Jews" signs in front of synagogues to read 
"Admit Soviet Jews." 
</P>
<P>
There may always have been a degree of cynicism and political opportunism in 
the official American policy toward Soviet Jewish emigration. Some will accuse 
Soviet Jews of trying to jump ahead of other persecuted people who want to come 
here. But does the United States not have an obligation to those people whose 
freedom it has demanded for 15 years? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Soviets who took U.S. rhetoric seriously should have been warned 
long ago that this nation of immigrants has a lot of practice shutting its door 
on those it has encouraged to flee oppression elsewhere.

LEBANON PLAN MAY END IRAN, SYRIA AFFAIR 
</P>

Syria and Iran may be parting company over the Taif Agreement, the peace plan 
for Lebanon reached last month in Saudi Arabia. A split between the two 
countries would be a development of major regional importance. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has been Iran's only ally in the Arab world, and the link between Persian 
Farsi Shia Iran and Semitic Arabic Sunni Muslim Syria was an unusual, perhaps 
even unnatural, alliance that was nevertheless fairly solidly based on mutual 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
For both countries, it brought pincer-like pressure on the common enemy, Iraq. 
Syrian hostility along Iraq's southern border, and especially its military 
assistance to dissident Iraqi Kurds fighting Baghdad in its northern area, was 
a serious distraction for Iraq during the Gulf War. But the alliance isolated 
Syria from its Arab brethren and particularly angered Syria's two paymasters, 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- they cut off or reduced their funding. This was 
offset to some extent by Iran supplying Syria with oil free of charge or at 
reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian link benefited Iran not only by distracting Iraq but by showing that 
Iran was not cut off from the Arab and Muslim world. It also helped Iran in an 
all-important ideological objective, exporting the Islamic Revolution. Syria 
permitted Iranian Revolutionary Guards to establish a base in the 
Syrian-occupied Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, through which Iran was able to channel 
money, arms and medical supplies to the devoutly pro-Iranian Shia militia, 
Hezbollah, in the Beirut area and in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of benefits thus clearly did not favor Syria and in the last three 
or four years Damascus became increasingly aware of this fact. The end of the 
Gulf War a year ago deprived the alliance of its raison d'etre -- there was no 
longer any reason why Syria should not loosen its links with Iran, unpopular 
both inside Syria and abroad, and follow Egypt's example in embracing the Arab 
family, which could also bring renewed financial assistance. For the past two 
years the oil deal also lost importance: Syria now produces 400,000 barrels of 
oil a day, exporting 150,000 while receiving just 20,000 a day from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
When the Arab League decided to push for a negotiated end to the Lebanese civil 
war, Syria decided that aiding this process would help it regain Arab 
respectability. Indeed, since March, Syria has been conferring closely with the 
United States (expanding a long-standing, semicovert working arrangement) on 
Lebanon, to convince the United States of its sincere desire to pull out its 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian concessions and guarantees enabled the three weeks of talks in Taif to 
come to a satisfactory conclusion, enabling election of a new Lebanese 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian regime was displeased, seeing the agreement as leading to a 
slackening of pressure on Iraq. Hard-liners such as Iran's spiritual head, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still a power though out of office, and the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei's son, Ahmed, were especially irate. In the intense 
power struggle going on since the death of Ayatollah Khomenei, this hard-line 
group has so far managed to contain and almost neutralize the pragmatists 
around President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, considered a neutral in the 
Iranian power struggle, two weeks ago established his headquarters in the 
Iranian embassy in Damascus and from there orchestrated the Lebanese opposition 
to the Taif Agreement. After meeting with all Iran's friends in Lebanon, both 
Shia and Sunni and with left-wing Palestinian dissidents, he said that it was 
"the duty of Lebanese Muslims to frustrate the Taif Agreement and Iran will 
support them in doing so" -- all this in clear opposition to Syria's official 
position on that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a peace in Lebanon, then Hezbollah -- having denounced the Taif 
Agreement as "an American plot" -- would need to be suppressed, which would 
almost certainly involve armed conflict. To complicate matters, Hezbollah and 
its attached groups are the ones holding the Western hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Syria -- long wanting to be rid of the hostage embarrassment and claiming to be 
the upholder of law and order in Lebanon -- would have to take firm 
counteraction against a Hezbollah uprising, which would be joined by 
Hezbollah's local Shia competitor, the militia of the Amal movement that is 
more Lebanese nationalist than pro-Iranian in its loyalties. The fate of the 
hostages would then become even more perilous. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, both Syria and Iran are stating but not pushing their 
different views. But the hard fact is that those differences have an 
inescapable dynamic of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the shaky Syrian-Iranian connection has been clouded by actions 
of the secessionist Maronite Gen. Michel Aoun, who has refused to recognize the 
election last weekend of Rene Mouawad as Lebanon's new president. 
</P>
<P>
If Aoun continues to maintain his partitionist Christian enclave, Marounistan, 
because of opposition to the Taif Agreement, Hezbollah will not need to take 
any anti-Taif action on its own, and will not be seen as acting in concert with 
its hated Maronite enemy. But if the general is eliminated and a pro-Taif 
Lebanese regime is consolidated, then Hezbollah, to avoid a show of impotence, 
will have to take action, political or military, with Iranian support, thus 
throwing down a challenge to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The latter seems more likely, because Aoun has been universally rejected, 
especially after the attack by his forces on the house and person of Nasrallah 
Sfeir, the patriarch of the Marounite Church. 
</P>
<P>
A Syria-Iran breach would affect the whole region. Iran's dream of exporting 
Islamic revolution would become more fantasy-like than ever. And Iran would be 
far more isolated in the region, either in voluntary withdrawal or with a 
violent and revengeful act against those isolating it.

WITH MITCHELL, DEMOCRATS FIND EFFECTIVE SPOKESMAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many Democrats, happy days are here again in the person of Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell. On such highly visible issues as the proposed 
capital-gains tax cut and the fledgling democracy movement spreading across 
Eastern Europe, the lean and reserved Maine Democrat is the long-pined-for 
articulator on where his party stands and how it differs from the GOP of George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's ideology is close to textbook liberalism. But the ex-federal judge's 
lawyerly demeanor appears to have enhanced his effectiveness and appeal -- at 
least in Congress and with the press -- by masking partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, Mitchell has comfortably moved into his new political role. 
In his first year as majority leader, he has also been feeling his way in the 
separate and frequently arduous legislative task of managing 99 unruly egos. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to measure Mitchell's full impact, Bush conferred a 
backhanded compliment at his broadcast press conference on Election Day. In 
excoriating the Democratic-controlled Congress for its dismal performance in 
addressing his first-year agenda, the President made one notable exception. 
With Mitchell, said Bush, "there's an honest difference of opinion on capital 
gains." 
</P>
<P>
As painful as the result has been for Bush, the capital-gains fight has made 
Mitchell something of a hero. Without his unyielding opposition to Bush's 
initiative, the Senate almost surely would have followed in lock step behind 
the House's approval of the tax cut in September. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had an advantage: the Senate's filibuster rule requires 60 senators to 
shut off extended debate. As Bush complained, his forces had the majority 
needed to pass the capital-gains bill, but they could not rally enough forces 
to compel the vote. Mitchell enjoyed no such parliamentary advantage in 
orchestrating two other critical setbacks for the President on Capitol Hill: 
rejection in March of the nomination of John G. Tower as defense secretary and 
last month's defeat of the constitutional amendment to bar flag-burning. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the axiom that "good politics" often is "no politics," Mitchell 
-- like a cardsharp poor-mouthing his own hand -- downplays his own leadership 
in foiling Bush's initiatives. These were not issues that "I went out and 
sought," he said in an interview last week. "They were forced upon us by the 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell would rather talk about several legislative initiatives he has ushered 
through the Senate, often in the face of Administration opposition. Among them 
are tougher oil-spill liability standards, rural development, minimum wage -- 
and a child-care bill that he trumpets as his chief accomplishment. The 
majority leader also likes to remind listeners that he cooperated this spring 
with Bush, to the chagrin of some Democrats, in early efforts to reach 
agreement on the budget and on humanitarian aid to the Contras. But such 
bipartisanship has been fleeting in the Senate, as was demonstrated anew in 
last week's continuing conflict over the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's differences have been chiefly with White House hard-liners, 
including Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Office of Management and Budget 
Director Richard G. Darman, not with the more conciliatory Senate Republicans 
led by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Dole's independence of Bush on both 
capital gains and budget is, in part, because "Dole wants to present an 
alternative Republican plan," said an Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Mitchell is the beneficiary, and he is doing what he can 
to broaden his relationship with Dole. As a result, Dole has been less partisan 
in his approach to issues than in the past, according to a source close to the 
Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his nonpartisan air and his friendship with Bush (they have shared 
weekend plane rides to Kennebunkport), Mitchell has been almost contemptuous of 
Bush's cautiousness in foreign policy. On steps to encourage and strengthen 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initiatives, aid to Poland and Hungary and Bush's 
reluctance to criticize the Chinese crackdown in Tian An Men Square, Mitchell 
has called for more aggressive, more liberal U.S. actions. 
</P>
<P>
As Mitchell has become more vocal, other Democratic senators have urged him to 
speak out even more and to move beyond what some Democrats earlier this year 
considered his own undue caution. Taking a tougher, more partisan approach has 
its own risks, but Mitchell appears willing -- especially when he, the smart 
lawyer, knows he has a good case. Mitchell has ruled out, for example, any 
effort to cooperate with Bush next year on a budget "summit," which some White 
House aides consider the only way to allow all sides to make the politically 
difficult choices in cutting the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has sworn off a 1992 presidential bid, his legislative efforts and 
rhetoric could go a long way toward shaping the political environment of that 
contest. For the dogged and often underestimated Mitchell, the move to the 
center of the national political stage may know no bounds.

September was summit month in the world of education. Commentators on the 
meeting of 50 governors and the President stumbled over each other discovering 
that what's at stake in U.S. schooling is the quality of our work force. But 
their vision came to a screeching stop at the high school graduation line. The 
pundits would have been wiser -- and more faithful to the governors' concerns 
-- had they borrowed Lester C. Thurow's observation that a national work force 
is like an army: it cannot function with lousy lieutenants any more than it can 
function with comatose corporals. The lieutenants go to college. 
</P>
<P>
October was "national quality month" in the corporate world. Chief executive 
officers rushed up to microphones to proclaim that quality improvement was more 
relevant to America's future standard of living than a golden parachute. A 
Gallup survey conducted for the American Society for Quality Control allows us 
a peek into the musings of these generals of our national work force. For 
example, the effects of mergers and acquisitions worry them; consumers, they 
speculate, would pay $2,674 more for a $12,000 car if its quality were better; 
and 61% say they are largely responsible for what quality improvement there has 
been. Along the way, 44% of the CEOs gave the U.S. education system a grade of 
D or less, singling out workers and middle managers for special criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Those most feeling the executive heat were junior managers -- Thurow's 
lieutenants. As the newest products of the mass education system, they embody 
the cumulative efforts of primary, secondary and higher education to produce 
quality workers. As such, they should be a significant concern of the 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that a significant portion of our entry-level managerial work 
force majored in business administration. Since 1985, in fact, our colleges 
have handed out more than a million business degrees to undergraduates. Who are 
these people? What did they actually study? How well did they perform in 
college? 
</P>
<P>
These are not idle questions. Formal learning is largely responsible for how 
well these college graduates will help U.S. corporations achieve quality in 
production, design and marketing, among other areas. If the nation is to be 
competitive in the international economy of the 1990s, we had better know who 
our lieutenants are. 
</P>
<P>
The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 provides some 
answers. Designed and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of 
Educational Research and Improvement, it followed the lives of 23,000 high 
school seniors for 14 years. The college transcripts of 12,600 were collected 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Business-administration majors accounted for 16% of the bachelor's degrees 
(5,000) earned by the group. As entering freshmen, their SAT scores, high 
school class ranking and academic aspirations were the lowest, overall, of any 
comparable group. The high school class of '72 was not an anomaly, though. In 
1985, business-administration majors among entering freshmen ranked even lower 
on the same criteria. 
</P>
<P>
What did those who earned their bachelor's study? 
</P>
<P>
Of all credits earned, 37% were in business subjects, 8% in economics, 2% in 
office-support skills, 2% in computer science, 7% in communication skills and 
8% in mathematics. With 64% of their time devoted to these "core" subjects, the 
business majors had little time remaining for other subjects. Indeed, 77% took 
no foreign language and 10% did not study any other internationally oriented 
course. Also, only 4% pursued industrial or quality-control technology. 
</P>
<P>
If these graduates sought an entry job in sales or customer relations, which 
increasingly involve foreign markets and technological products or services, 
they simply aren't prepared. We can argue whether pharmaceutical salespersons 
truly need to study pharmaceutical chemistry in college, but I'd rather hire 
those who did -- and who could explain the virtues of both a drug and a 
company's distribution system in, let's say, German. 
</P>
<P>
Closer inspection of what constituted the "core" study yields even less 
encouraging data. A third of the communications-skills credits and a quarter of 
the math credits were in remedial courses. Two-thirds of all business-course 
credits were in "basic mechanics" (accounting, corporate finance, marketing, 
etc.) 
</P>
<P>
Women provide the only promise in this depressing pattern. Their undergraduate 
curricula contained more of what U.S. corporations now say they want: foreign 
languages and international studies, contextual and integrative studies, even 
production/product management. But at age 32-33, the women were paid 27% less 
than the men. This unhappy paradox of pay and preparation cannot endure. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the business curriculum, though, are not impressive for either 
gender. After four, five or six years in college, business-administration 
majors do not perform well on admissions tests to graduate school. In fact, on 
the Graduate Management Admissions Test, they ranked 19th of 20 fields in 1985, 
a position they have held for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Some will argue that all this reflects a simple case of GIGO, or "garbage in, 
garbage out." The governors would disagree -- and they are right. If 
course-content standards are raised by finding and filling in the missing 
elements of the business curriculum, student performance and contributions can 
be indirectly improved. 
</P>
<P>
At least three components come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
One is the customer, who is treated as a "microsystem" or "institution" rather 
than as a human being. To study cultural anthropology or urban history would be 
a far better way to humanize this "customer" than a course in marketing 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Another is competence in science. Technological empowerment is not simply the 
ability to program a computer. Rather, it is understanding what is being 
programmed. Business-administration majors are taught plenty about operations 
and precious little about their content. You can't teach science or technology 
in a product-management course. You must require it before the students get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, imagination is missing. The fact that two-thirds of business courses 
taken by the study's business-administration students were in four "basic 
mechanics" is frightening. For starters, that means a carbon-copy generation of 
managers is playing an important role in the conduct of American business. No 
wonder their only motivation for learning is a vision of the next leveraged 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Can imagination be learned? Yes, by induction, by doing something more than 
rehearsing the mechanics. You can't write music simply by practicing an 
instrument. You must know the literature of many instruments and the theory 
that both structures and liberates. And you must be willing and able to work 
outside the box of conventional formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The task of preparing lieutenants for the work force will not be easy, but 
following the education summit, the only way to go is up. One trusts that 
business-school deans and corporate representatives will listen to the 
governors and demand more of college curricula.

'IS PRIVATE JUSTICE FAIR?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There lies, deep in the soul of every American, an egalitarian spirit which is, 
at once, one of our strengths and a constant invitation to shoot ourselves in 
the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty five of us in Los Angeles County have been engaged, for two years, in an 
effort often known as the "fast-track," designed to radically improve the speed 
of our civil courts. It is quite possible to get a major case in one of our 
courts resolved in under a year, a far cry from the five-year wait which was 
standard a couple of years ago. We've done this through awfully hard work (by 
ourselves, our staffs and lawyers), by better methods and, perhaps, even with 
mirrors, but we've done it with no new judicial resources and the simplest of 
truths is that we need every bit of help we can get from "the outside," whether 
it be arbitration, voluntary settlement programs or retired judges, working as 
"rent-a-judges." 
</P>
<P>
I ask counsel in many of the thousand cases I inherited at the beginning of 
"fast-track" to use rent-a-judges for settlement conferences, pointing out that 
the $300 or $400 fee will be less than their copying bill. This minuscule 
(compared to legal fees and costs) expenditure has settled perhaps 200 cases 
this year, each of which would average easily five days each to try. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit to counsel and the citizens involved in those cases which do have 
to be actually tried is extraordinary and the notion that only the wealthy 
utilize rent-a-judges is, in my experience, simply nonsense: Their use, in a 
great number of cases saves parties lots of money, mostly in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Before we join Madame Defarge in the zealous pursuit of total equality, we 
should be pretty sure the shrouds aren't being knitted for large numbers of 
innocent victims -- the litigants of all economic levels in our state.

URBAN WING COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kimball L. Garrett has counted a cumulative total of 108 bird species in and 
around Exposition Park, which says something about the habitats of downtown Los 
Angeles. But he is quick to discourage drawing excessively generous conclusions 
about the impact of urbanization on wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
His report is published in the fall edition of Terra, the magazine of the 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, where he is ornithology 
collections manager. The museum, of course, nestles in Exposition Park, which 
facilitates a current count. His list is even longer if one counts some of the 
exotics and escapees, such as Patagonian Conures and Zebra finches that have 
been observed. But 21 of the species have only been seen once, which gives 
credence to Garrett's argument that "over time, if enough people are looking, 
you can find everything." 
</P>
<P>
The commitment of Southern California bird watchers has produced a total count 
of some 445 native species over the years. Paradoxically, a diverse urban 
landscape of exotic plants can, under ideal circumstances, support an abundance 
of birds greater than in some native habitats but never the equal of the 
teeming populations in the riparian forests so often lost to urbanization. He 
told us that he is concerned that the cumulative numbers will lead to 
complacency about the impact of the city when, in fact, "we are doing terrible 
things to the bird population in the county through the loss of native 
habitat." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is significant that some 90 species nest in the area. But it 
must be remembered that close to half of the species on the cumulative list are 
migrants, seen only rarely. And there is no way to count the species that have 
been forever lost to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"While it cannot be seriously argued that the artificial habitats of parks such 
as Los Angeles' Exposition Park constitute nationally significant wildlife 
habitat, they nevertheless harbor an astonishing diversity of birds," he 
concluded.

"We interrupt this program . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone has heard the tests of the emergency broadcast system on the radio 
from time to time. But when it was needed most, during the Oct. 17 earthquake 
in Northern California, there was not much interrupting by the emergency 
network and precious little information given out to disaster victims when the 
system did function. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, two hours after the quake struck, a message from San Francisco Mayor 
Art Agnos appealing for calm was broadcast. But some stations did not even 
bother to tune in to the system, much less carry its information. Others said 
they were getting better information from their own reporters. A major problem 
seems to have been that officials had trouble gathering up-to-date information 
and transmitting it via the official network, according to a review of quake 
communications problems by Joel Kugelmass, a telecommunications management 
analyst, in the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the failure of EBS was not a major problem because local 
radio and television stations were able to broadcast information relatively 
quickly. That might not have been had the quake been stronger, or lasted a few 
seconds longer. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the early information, on an official areawide level, came from Dan 
Rather interviews on CBS News with Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who was acting 
governor because Gov. George Deukmejian was in Europe at the time. McCarthy's 
reports were cautious and calming, but relatively incomplete during the evening 
because of difficulty in getting information from such isolated areas as 
Watsonville and Santa Cruz, and even San Jose. Early Wednesday, McCarthy began 
telephoning a variety of news media outlets to distribute as much authentic 
information as was available. 
</P>
<P>
As good as the broadcast news reports may have been, the problem for listeners 
and viewerswas that they had no central broadcast point from which to receive 
the latest, most comprehensive information from official sources. The Emergency 
Broadcast System is supposed to be that central point. 
</P>
<P>
Some local emergency communications systems seemed to work well, but they are 
meant for public agencies to talk to each other. The telephone system remained 
in operation and, although it was immediately overwhelmed with calls, emergency 
messages were given priority and got through after some delay. The major 
breakdown was in getting official information directly from the officials to 
the people. "We talked to the whole world," one Oakland official said, while 
another office was in constant communication with one talk radio station. But 
an earthquake victim should not have to keep scanning the dial to get critical 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency system is a volunteer operation supervised by the Federal 
Communications Commission. The FCC presumably will evaluate the quake-night 
performance and possibly make improvements. But the state of California should 
not wait for that to happen. California officials must make it a priority to 
have as foolproof as possible a system of emergency communications with the 
public in future disasters, especially earthquakes. This must include equipment 
that can go into operation quickly, by satellite transmission if necessary. It 
also must have public officials available who have ready access to local, 
regional, state and federal sources of information and can get it on the air 
without delay. 
</P>
<P>
As noted by Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City), "It's time to stop 
thinking of communications as an expense and start thinking of it as an 
investment in the health and safety of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Californians may be left in the dark during the first terrifying hours of an 
earthquake disaster. But they should not be left ignorant of what is going on 
as well.

'IS PRIVATE JUSTICE FAIR?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial opposing alternative dispute resolution is off base historically 
and as policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being a recent phenomenon, the law which "allows" litigants to 
select a private judge to hear their case and have the judgment entered in 
court has been part of California law since 1872. Our law and the courts 
encourage litigants to resolve their disputes without trials and as quickly as 
possible. In the Superior Courts, cases having less than $50,000 at issue are 
assigned to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Parties to lawsuits cannot be forced to hire a private judge to hear their 
case; they must agree voluntarily. How can it be claimed they do anyone any 
harm by selecting that method to conclude their dispute? 
</P>
<P>
The best way to reduce the burden on the courts would be to reduce the number 
of criminal cases by repealing victimless crime laws. Yes, I mean re-legalize 
marijuana, cocaine and heroin and leave the gamblers and hookers alone. That's 
not a perfect solution, but it would sure lighten the load on the judges and 
substantially reduce the delay in civil cases.

<P>
Your editorial recognizes a long-term problem in civil litigation, but seems to 
attack one of the solutions instead of the problem itself. 
</P>
<P>
In using the "rent-a-judge" method of settling civil disputes, the prudent (not 
necessarily wealthy) litigant avoids possible heavy financial losses or 
lingering family alienation that could result in lengthy waits for court dates. 
The result of the method? Reducing the court load! 
</P>
<P>
Robert Raven and Alan Rothenberg complain that this method of "private justice" 
could reduce the will of our politicians to solve the civil court log jam. If 
that's truly their concern, maybe they should spend their time and efforts 
lobbying to see that doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect Raven and Rothenberg, being presidents of the American and State Bar 
Assns., respectively, have a more mundane motive. They would like to protect 
the financial interests of their members who are seeing long-term cases 
disappear along with the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' warning of a two-class court system comes too late. We presently 
have such a system in the criminal court system where those who can afford them 
have powerful, big-name attorneys, and the poor are relegated to using 
well-meaning but overworked public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution to help alleviate the overwhelmed civil system would be to 
raise the limits of small claims courts even more to $5,000 or even $10,000 and 
use more commissioners and experienced lawyers in that court. 
</P>
<P>
But please, don't fault the prudent or wealthy for finding their own solution 
to the problem, fix the problem!

Recently, an indictment in Alexandria, Va., was brought to our attention. The 
charges involved a group of men who had plotted to kidnap or purchase a young 
boy for the purpose of sexually molesting, torturing and then murdering him. 
The twist was that these men planned to film the whole ordeal for the sexual 
pleasure of other like-minded citizens -- and for profit. They were producers 
of what is often referred to as a "snuff" film. The tape-recorded words of one 
of these men note, "I wanna do it one time before I die." The man was said to 
be willing to find a boy as young as 12, but one who was 13 or 14 was "more 
along my lines." 
</P>
<P>
One is tempted to gasp, then shake off the feeling of shock and horror by 
reassuring ourselves that the view expressed is that of an infinitesimal 
minority, and try to forget it. Sadly, however, the consequences of hard-core 
and child pornography are too extensive to ignore. Their cost to individuals 
and to society is measured daily in our sexual-abuse rates. In America at least 
one of four women is sexually assaulted in her lifetime. Conservative estimates 
put the number of molested children at more than 1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
Behind these horrendous statistics of abuse are movies like "Bleed, Little 
Girl, Bleed," "Young Girls in Heat" and "Kiddie Killer" that stimulate 
fantasies of sexual mayhem. Understandably, the sad facts of sexual violence -- 
whether in the production or consumption of these illegal materials -- are 
never mentioned in the sales pitches that hard-core vendors use to sell their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
As a nation that prides itself on defending the human rights of people 
everywhere, we need a collective determination to eliminate hard-core and child 
pornography. And such determination is not a challenge to the First Amendment, 
which we affirm; opposition to obscenity and child pornography falls within the 
protection of our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, we seem to have reached a national consensus on fighting the spread of 
addictive drugs. There are, unhappily, many similarities between the realities 
of illegal drugs and the realities of illegal pornography. With each purchase, 
the "casual" cocaine user contributes to the murderous assault on Colombian 
society and to escalating drug-related crime in the United States. Elected 
leaders, at home and abroad, face death threats from cartels because addicted 
Americans, through their purchases, provide money for hired assassins. So too, 
in the world of hard-core and child pornography: With each purchase, the 
"private" consumer of obscenity contributes to the victimization of other human 
persons and the degradation of individuals, of human love and of society.b 
</P>
<P>
To speak of obscenity and child pornography as we are doing here raises First 
Amendment concerns for many people. It is a concern that we welcome, because we 
are religious leaders who cherish and defend the First Amendment as the basis 
of our religious freedom, as well as our freedoms of speech, assembly and 
press. 
</P>
<P>
But we need to point out that the First Amendment does not protect obscenity or 
child pornography. The Supreme Court has ruled time and again that obscenity 
and child pornography are categorically excluded from constitutional 
protection. Why? Because they exist at the cost of another human person's 
dignity and well-being, and in the worst cases, life. 
</P>
<P>
Obscenity and child pornography, we might note, are not the only forms of 
speech standing outside First Amendment protection. We are all aware that 
libel, slander and the proverbial yelling of "Fire" in a crowded theater are 
also prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has been criticized for its growing attention to this 
issue in prosecuting obscenity and child pornography. In many cases, these 
criticisms are the cry of an $8-billion to $10 billion-per-year "industry" that 
is feeling the effects of appropriate government action. As persons committed 
to human dignity and the common good, we are grateful for the Justice 
department's efforts and diligence, and we believe most Americans share our 
gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that our nation is inherently opposed to the degradation or abuse of 
any group of citizens. If we continue to pretend that illegal pornography is 
just harmless "fun," we will do so at the expense of our national ideals. If we 
ignore the abuse, degradation and victimization that occurs daily in the world 
of hard-core and child pornography, we will do so at the expense of our 
humanity, our conscience as a society, and most of all, at the expense of our 
collective desire for a country that affirms the dignity of each person. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that just as all people need to stand together to fight racial 
discrimination, illegal drugs and other social evils, so now we must also stand 
together against illegal pornography. It must stop; we must and can make it 
stop, and the time to act is now.

EAST GERMANY: ONE PROSPECT IS THAT, AFTER SOME AGONIZING, THE COUNTRY WILL FIND

"We are the people." When demonstrators shouted those words, it was an ironic 
and bitter indictment of 40 years of the German Democratic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
So far, mass demonstrations have been acted out with a subtlety and finesse 
that flatly contradicted all speculations that after 12 years of totalitarian 
Nazism and 44 years of totalitarian communism, the human mind would be utterly 
deformed. A great chapter of history is taking place right at our doorstep. The 
German question, instead of being posed in terms of power politics, is 
translated into human rights and the pursuit of happiness. Finally, the East 
Europeans refuse to go on losing World War II. The nations of Eastern Europe 
are coming in from the cold. This is not only a human concern. It is also a 
question of what kind of Europe we want in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany, situated in mid-stage, is going through a crisis that can only be 
described in terms of a revolution. Economic decline, so far conspicuous only 
in other Communist countries, is now dramatically exposed -- the infrastructure 
run down, inner cities crumbling. The environment is in a ruined state. A loss 
of legitimacy has caused part of the Politburo and the entire cabinet to 
resign. The petty bureaucrats and functionaries of the ruling party are mending 
their ways and finding out that it is better to side with reform. Institutions 
no longer perform as expected. East German television has suddenly become part 
of the drama, no longer the drab ritual of party rhetoric but a scene where 
anything can take place, including indictment of the Socialist Unity, or 
Communist, Party. Unless a new social contract can be formulated, indeed a new 
political constitution framed, East Germany is not going to last. 
</P>
<P>
The independent variable is, of course, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. There was no love 
lost between today's men in the Soviet Union and yesterday's men in East 
Germany. Both sides suspected each other of wanting to bring the other side 
down. Gorbachev, when visiting East Berlin in early October, had a few things 
to say to Erich Honecker, then still East Germany's No. 1. Although this was 
done in the closet, the message was sensed by everybody, and it had two parts: 
You had better get on with a German version of glasnost and perestroika; and if 
you don't, our troops will not save you. 
</P>
<P>
Egon Krenz, when looking for reassurance in Moscow four weeks later, must have 
received a revised version. It could have read as follows: You must go ahead 
with reform, and we will not put relations with the West at risk if you go 
astray; however, if the very existence of East Germany is at stake, we will be 
on your side. This is indeed the ambiguity that has left Krenz in a tense and 
difficult situation. What he did would have been extravagant only two months 
ago. Now he is behind the psychological schedule of the country, and even the 
Communist Party faithful tell him so. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Krenz not anticipate the inevitable and announce on nationwide TV that, 
as the border with Czechoslovakia and from there into West Germany was open 
anyway, the Berlin Wall would be taken down? Why did he not say that the 
planning bureaucracy would be sacked and service industries would be freely 
admitted in the form of private enterprise? Why did he not invite foreign 
investment into East Germany, where it would find a first-rate work force and 
-- sooner or later -- healthy returns? Why did he not say, right away, that 
authentic political parties would be admitted, following Hungary's example, and 
that unrigged elections would follow in the next six months -- with an apology 
for fumbling the last elections? Why did he not add that a constitutional court 
would be set up to make sure the East German constitution, the United Nations 
charter and the Helsinki final act are respected by the authorities? Why did he 
not close by saying that legislation would follow soon to restore the historic 
parts of what is now East Germany? 
</P>
<P>
He could have added a patriotic appeal that, given the challenge of the future 
and the admission of failure on the part of the Communist Party, would the 
people not, please, reconsider and give him a fair chance to preside over the 
transition to democracy? He would have gone down in history not only as a man 
of Realpolitik, but probably as the man who saved the existence of East Germany 
for the time being and helped to stabilize the Central European chessboard. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Krenz did almost none of the above. And what he did was received 
by the subsequent mass demonstration with a devastating comment: "Too late, too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
What is to come next? If there is no evolutionary transition between 
yesterday's neo-Stalinism and tomorrow's liberal democracy, East Germany may 
glide into limbo for awhile, with the revolution from below conspicuously 
lacking bite, vision and credibility. Return to the status quo is no option -- 
an explosion would be the answer. So we are in for a long period of unrest, 
turmoil and uneasy compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The security framework of the Warsaw Pact will have to stay in place, but -- as 
the Hungarians insist -- it must be transformed from a military into a 
politico-military alliance. The North Atlantic alliance is going in that 
direction anyway. The notion of cooperative security will have to graduate from 
being a slogan to becoming a process. Most important of all, the two nuclear 
superpowers will have to agree on a formula that would help to prevent a 
pre-1914 situation from arising. Summitry will not be enough. The East-West 
Helsinki process, which has taken on so many roles during the past 16 years, 
would have to provide the arena for face-saving solutions, retreats and 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
But what would be a sustainable, long-term solution for so much drama and so 
dangerous a place like Central Europe? Every successor to Egon Krenz must try 
to regain the initiative and will probably have to go even beyond what Krenz 
failed to say on TV. Otherwise, East Germany will not overcome the state of 
turmoil it is in. The exodus of the young generation will not be halted, and a 
major East-West crisis will ensue, putting at risk not only the reform of East 
Germany but East-West detente and perestroika in Moscow as well. Some big 
thinking is needed. 
</P>
<P>
It has not sufficiently been appreciated so far that the consequence of deep 
cuts in conventional arms, now being discussed in Vienna, will be a different 
strategic architecture in Eastern Europe. Soviet troops, if they are indeed 
reduced in large quantities, will no longer bolster Communist oligarchies, now 
mostly out of office anyway (witness the resignation Friday of Bulgaria's Todor 
Zhivkov), or hold the West hostage. What will remain in place in Eastern Europe 
will, however, still be enough to keep the glacis for the motherland. But the 
stabilizing role for Communist regimes will have gone, perhaps forever. This in 
itself will be a major force for change. 
</P>
<P>
As to the West, the excitement about instant reunification of Germany is 
premature. It is much more important to think about Western teamwork for 
associating the East Europeans with cooperative efforts in Western Europe. 
After the silent demise of the East European trading bloc and the gradual 
decline of the Warsaw Pact, together with the conspicuous weakening of Soviet 
hegemonial will and muscle, what structure is there to keep Eastern Europe in 
balance? At present, it is a collection of poor houses in a super-rust belt 
stretching from the Baltic to the Danube Valley, with a host of bitter 
conflicts ranging from the suppression of minorities to environmental feuds. No 
one except the European Community offers any chance of being the federateur of 
Eastern Europe, through tailor-made forms of long-term association. A Marshall 
Plan has often been advocated. What is needed now is something on an even 
grander scale, a political design of peaceful change through economic means and 
political encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
The perennial German question will be at the center of all this, and this is at 
the same time part of the problem and part of the solution. Two countries, one 
the size of Ireland, the other one the size of Britain, 16 million and 60 
million Germans respectively, are in search of a very special relationship 
whose shape, nature and name will affect all of Europe and, for that matter, 
Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic is firmly anchored in the West, NATO and the European 
Community, and the firmer the better. It needs both the confidence of its 
partners and the negotiating power offered through the Atlantic alliance to 
handle a problem that is potentially fraught with strategic imbalances and 
dangerous misunderstandings. The integration of West Germany in the European 
Community is, incidentally, also to be seen as an element of reassurance for 
the East Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
If the East German government, despite its reform and its willingness to open 
the Brandenburg Gate, cannot regain the initiative, the place could slide into 
an unmanageable state and be deeply destabilizing for its strategic environment 
as well as for the East-West relationship. An unmanageable state is at present 
the most undesirable scenario. 
</P>
<P>
A more likely outcome is that, after a period of agonizing reform, the country 
will emerge at the other end of the crisis in a different shape, perhaps having 
found a new equilibrium between democratic socialism and liberal capitalism, 
between its Western heart and its Eastern raison d'etat, and perhaps even 
arrive at an identity that is not entirely dependent on rejection or imitation 
of the Federal Republic of Germany.

WHEN 'SERVICE' LOOKS LIKE 'CORRUPTION'; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN S&amp;L: LAWMAKING HAS DEGENERATED SO FAR THAT THE SENATORS' 
INTERVENTION DID NOT GREATLY DIFFER FROM THE ROUTINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BETHELL, Tom Bethell is Washington editor of the American Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest word from Washington is that senatorial interference in the 
regulation of a financially unsound savings-and-loan is an example of 
"constituent service." 
</P>
<P>
"I have done this kind of thing many, many times," said Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), one of five senators who intervened with federal regulators to help 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, Calif. He compared it to "helping the 
little lady who didn't get her Social Security check." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of Lincoln was Charles H. Keating Jr., a Phoenix businessman who 
is now accused of fraud. Keating or his associates donated more than $1 million 
to political organizations controlled by McCain and by four Democratic 
senators: Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Donald 
Riegle Jr. of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the senators pressured Edwin J. Gray former then the chairman of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to grant Lincoln an exemption to a regulation 
restricting S&amp;L investments in real estate and junk bonds. Gray recently 
testified before the House Banking Committee that Keating "devised a scheme" 
whereby Lincoln's problems would seem to be the result "of a vendetta against 
Lincoln by its regulators, principally myself." The senators evidently "bought 
off on this scheme," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged that money was a factor in his actions. He attributed 
the Lincoln episode to the large sums needed for Senate campaigns. "Obviously," 
he said, "if you didn't have to get campaign contributions nobody would be 
making anything out of it. It led to the appearance of impropriety." (Lincoln 
S&amp;L later collapsed and its bailout may cost taxpayers $2 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
What are we to make of the "constituent service" claim? The truth is that the 
process of enacting laws in Washington has now degenerated so far that the 
senators' intervention did not greatly differ from the routine. Ideally, laws 
are supposed to be impersonal and universal in their application. Today, 
however, Congress is best thought of as a trillion-dollar "common pool" to 
which 535 legislators have joint access. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation now routinely disburses federal monies to constituents who also 
happen to be campaign contributors. And it goes, of course, to constituents who 
may be expected to return the favor (with a vote) on election day. To achieve 
spending majorities, "logrolling" legislators support such projects in each 
others' districts. The manipulation of these dollar flows, as far as possible 
back into their home state or district, is now frankly the norm. 
</P>
<P>
What are we to make, for example, of the recent defense authorization bill? In 
the end it included $1 billion for the F-14D fighter plane, which the Pentagon 
wanted to kill. But lobbyists from the Grumman Corp. and congressmen whose 
constituents stood to gain were able to keep it flying. 
</P>
<P>
Even dovish congressmen will happily vote for such defense "pork-barrel" 
spending. They have a strong incentive to do so: If they neglect an opportunity 
to siphon millions of dollars back to their districts, the money will not just 
stay in the Treasury or be used to pay off the national debt. A different 
congressional coalition, supporting disaster relief or road improvements or a 
thousand other "needs" will gain access to the money and siphon it back to 
their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Civics textbooks dispose people to think of federal budget expenditures as 
determined by "need," as though this could be measured objectively. People with 
income below a certain level "need" help; next we are told that foreign 
countries with national incomes below a certain per capita level "need" 
assistance. And so it goes. The Lincoln S&amp;L affair suggests that among the 
needs legislators take into account are their own. Their "need" is to be 
reelected. (And it is quite reasonable, incidentally, for a senator or 
congressman to believe sincerely that his reelection is in the public 
interest.) 
</P>
<P>
We may agree, then, that the senators' intervention was something like what 
they do "all the time." Still, it did have unusual features, suggesting 
corruption. Everyday Capitol Hill logrolling is at least out in the open. Edwin 
Gray testified that his meeting with the senators was "highly unusual" in that 
it took place after normal working hours, in DeConcini's private office, with 
no staff members present. This makes it seem more conspiratorial than 
legislative. 
</P>
<P>
The "budget process" has broken down so badly that the senatorial intervention 
described by Gray and others is more of an addendum to mischief than a whole 
new chapter in the history of iniquity. Still, it did go beyond what we 
normally see inside the Beltway. "Corruption" might be a better word than 
"service."

VISION OF A BRAVE NEW WORLD;

<P>
BOOKS: BHARATI MUKHERJEE WRITES ABOUT THE NEW AMERICANS, THE NON-EUROPEAN 
IMMIGRANTS WHO SHE SAYS ARE CHANGING THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bharati Mukherjee is dark-skinned, her eyes and wavy hair black. Her accent is 
hard to place -- cultured, cultivated, of no specific region. She looks and 
sounds vaguely foreign. But she is an American, as American as apple pie. And 
her works describe a new kind of pie being put together here. 
</P>
<P>
"The new America is pervasive," she is often quoted as saying of people like 
herself. "We aren't just your doctors and pathologists, your nurses, newspaper 
vendors and green grocers. We're also your lovers, your husbands and your 
wives. We may even pop out as your children." 
</P>
<P>
And a central message of her writing is that the new Americans are having their 
effect on the mainstream; they are changing America. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, she won the 1988 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction 
for a collection of short stories, "The Middleman and Other Stories" (Grove 
Press). She was the first naturalized American to receive the honor. Born in 
India 49 years ago, she now lives on Manhattan's Upper Westside and teaches at 
Queens College and Columbia University. She has a new novel out, "Jasmine," 
also published by Grove, and was in Los Angeles briefly to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Both books involve the people that populate the "New America," the land of 
non-European immigrants, the thousands of newcomers from South Asia, Central 
and South America, Africa and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We're infiltrators!" she said over breakfast at her hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The word delights her. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Jasmine, once Jyoti Vijh of Hasnapur, a village in Punjab; 
then Jasmine, the recent immigrant to New York; then Jane Ripplemeyer of Baden, 
Iowa, on the lam from her past. 
</P>
<P>
"Through my fiction," Mukherjee said, "I make mainstream readers see the new 
Americans as complex human beings, not as just 'The Other.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unarguably, Jasmine is complex -- "a tornado," her creator calls her, driven at 
a high force through much of life, having an impact on those she meets, unsure 
what, if any, damage she has left behind. The superficials of her life rival a 
soap opera plot. Jasmine is married as a child to a "modern" man she loves, who 
gives her a new name as a break with the feudal past. She is widowed as a 
teen-ager when her husband is blown up by a Sikh nationalist, and, at age 19, 
as an illegal immigrant -- she comes to America. 
</P>
<P>
She tells herself she is in the United States to observe an ancient tradition 
</P>
<P>
and burn herself on the campus of the Florida school her husband wanted to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she says "yes" to life. 
</P>
<P>
"Being open to things, always saying 'yes,' Jasmine is a lot like me in that," 
Mukherjee said. "I try to build into the stories in 'Middleman' and in 
'Jasmine' varying degrees of letting go of the old culture." 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine lives with an Indian family in Flushing, Queens, where Punjabi culture 
has been imposed on life to such a degree the neighborhood is like a museum. 
She becomes an au pair to an academic couple, Taylor and Wylie, on the Upper 
Westside near Columbia, taking care of their child, being treated "just like 
one of the family" and trying, unsuccessfully, to deny her feelings for Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, Jasmine finds herself in Iowa, where, in no time at all and with little 
planning on her part, she has prompted a 50-year-old banker, Bud Ripplemeyer, 
to leave his wife. Until then, he had thought of Asia "only as a soybean 
market." 
</P>
<P>
They set up house together; they do not marry, but they adopt "Du," a 
Vietnamese adolescent. Bud is shot and paralyzed by a distressed farmer who 
could not get a loan at the bank, and Jasmine, whom Bud tried to make into Jane 
Ripplemeyer, becomes pregnant. She takes care of Bud but will not marry him, 
and remains, in her heart, Jasmine. 
</P>
<P>
It is Jasmine who must decide whether to stay with Bud out of affection and 
duty, or go off to California with Taylor and his child once Wylie has left 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to be American," Mukherjee said of Jasmine. "Not like a 19th-Century 
Anglo-Saxon, but living in the New World, with roots here. Jasmine always knows 
who she is and what she wants in the world. She does not malinger in the past." 
</P>
<P>
'Letting Go' 
</P>
<P>
The past, likewise, is no dwelling place for Mukherjee. Some of it may come 
along with her to the present, but she does not go back to it. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'letting go' of the old culture is not lost to me," she said, and, in 
that, she thinks she differs from many white sociologists but not young 
first-generation immigrants. "For me and for some of my characters, the New 
World is a net gain. The change is exhilarating. We're able to discard the 
traditional world of passivity, too much faith in destiny, the hierarchy of 
caste, class, traditional feudalism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she said of Americanization, she is not talking about people 
losing their identity and mimicking the mainstream. Anything but. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so radically, dramatically and, at the time, painfully reincarnated 
myself," she said, it would be a travesty to simply copy others' behavior. "To 
me, reincarnations in a lifetime are healthy. To pretend I was the Indian I was 
when I left would be a falsehood." 
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee was born in Calcutta to a privileged family. Her father was a 
pharmaceuticals manufacturer and she and her sister were raised with servants, 
culture, tradition and manners. She was sent to school for several years in 
England and Switzerland, and to a convent school run by Irish nuns in Calcutta. 
In school, she studied Catholic dogma; at home, she was surrounded by "very 
Hindu" lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I appropriated two worlds. I was not split, but had access completely 
to both," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She studied literature and ancient Indian culture at Indian universities, took 
her degrees, and, at her father's urging, left for America to enroll in the 
Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
That seems an odd wish for a man of culture and tradition to have for his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he didn't think writing would be a danger," she said. "It wouldn't 
threaten the life style. It would be an accomplishment." Like needlework or the 
piano. Jane Austen demurely scribbling away in a corner of the drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled with soft irony at that innocence, then added, "Also, I think he 
felt that the India he knew was coming to an end. West Bengal was coming under 
communist rule. Deep down -- he never articulated this -- he thought, 'OK, if 
things are to change dramatically, take your dowry and give yourself a chance.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Her father has been dead for three years. She has maintained close ties with 
her family and visits India every other year with her Canadian husband, writer 
Clark Blaise: "My intimacy with India is totally rooted with intimacy with the 
family. They have responded to Clark, and so has Calcutta. The last time we 
were there, he was referred to as 'son-in-law of the city.' " 
</P>
<P>
She met Blaise while at Iowa. They married there and in 1966 moved to Canada, 
writing and teaching at universities in Montreal and Toronto. By the mid '70s, 
they were raising two sons and she had published two novels, "The Tiger's 
Daughter" and "Wife," both dealing with Indian women balanced between two 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, Canada was getting to her. She left in 1978. Her husband and 
sons made it formal and followed her to the United States in 1980, going first 
to Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, then to New York. 
</P>
<P>
She left Canada because of racism, she said. What she found building in Canada 
in the 1970s, she said, was harassment of dark-skinned people, "especially 
South Asians. There was physical and institutional violence daily, even in my 
middle-class, reasonable neighborhood in a sophisticated city like Toronto. 
'Pakis,' for Pakistanis, 'Paki-bashing.' That came straight out of England." 
</P>
<P>
The government did little to discourage that climate, vaguely lending itself to 
it at times, she said. She spoke out against it publicly. She became 
politicized, but, she has said often, the choice was increasingly clear that if 
she was to stay in such an environment, she would have to become a political 
activist. Instead, she wanted to write. 
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee does not deny there is racism in the United States, and in fact she 
writes about it. It is also a multifaceted racism: blacks and whites, whites 
and everybody else, Asians and blacks. But American blacks do not figure much 
in the relationships and interactions Mukherjee describes. It is not that she 
is unaware, she said. Rather, it is an area of American racism where she does 
not "feel on top of it" in her understanding. In general, she will say racism 
here is part of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, officially racism is discouraged as un-American; there are laws, 
governmental institutions and private organizations to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
'I've Lived Everywhere' 
</P>
<P>
"I truly appreciate the special qualities that America and American national 
myths offer me. I've lived everywhere (and) I'm truly touched and moved by the 
idea of America. It includes you and is curious about other people. Includes 
you, allows you to think of yourself as an American. Other countries in Europe, 
and Canada, deliberately exclude you. You wouldn't dare to think of yourself 
(as one of them)." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, however, she said the politicization she underwent in Canada has 
made her a better writer. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept the kind of fate that exercised these rages in me," she said. "After 
the fact, I'm grateful for the politicization. I've become a very different 
kind of writer (due to) the rages and the desire for democracy and equal rights 
that were fanned in me. If I hadn't seen myself as 'The Other,' as something 
degraded, alien, I would have remained an elegant, mannered writer," something 
like Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, something like Jane Austen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she said, she was forced to see new relationships, and her fiction is 
full of them. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about her writing lights her face. She loves it. She lives to get at 
her laptop computer, she said, and even when not there, she is observing, 
making mental notes, "writing every minute." She does not carry a notebook 
around, telling herself, she said, "if it's important, I'll remember it." 
</P>
<P>
She is at work on a "vast historical novel" that she does not want to discuss 
in detail. She is moving to California next semester to become a distinguished 
professor at the University of California at Berkeley and hopes life there will 
allow her more writing time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, her husband, now at the University of Iowa, will join her. At 
times, she said, since they left Canada and tenured academe, finances have 
forced them into a commuter marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not regretted for a second that we gave up our secure jobs," she said. 
"Canada is in my past." 
</P>
<P>
She is no more an expatriate of Canada than she is of India. Neither are her 
characters expatriates. They are not economic refugees with their bags packed, 
ready to move on. They are digging in. For expatriates, she said, the real 
world is the country they left behind, and at that, it is an idealized version 
of it that in reality never was. 
</P>
<P>
In her recent novel, Jasmine's father was harking back to life in Lahore, 
before the partition of India and Pakistan, and Jasmine describes her reaction: 
"Lahore visionaries. Lahore women. Lahore music, Lahore ghazals (lyric poems): 
my father lived in a bunker. . . . He'll never see Lahore again and I never 
have. Only a fool would let it rule his life." 
</P>
<P>
Not her. 
</P>
<P>
Life is here and now -- and that means the new America. 
</P>
<P>
"Mine is a very optimistic vision of America," she said, acknowledging the 
"hell in a hand basket" notion some Americans have of the direction in which 
their country is heading. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in '61, not the '80s," she said. "I saw the kind of assured, 'No. 1,' 
confident, idealistic Kennedy-era America disappear right before my eyes. 
Native-born Americans may be in despair about this . . . but I say, 'Hey, give 
us five years!' I don't feel the depression the people who are always looking 
back to the '50s, to 'Father Knows Best' feel. I can see the coming of another 
glorious era. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have to work together, deal with drugs and education," she said. "I do 
worry about the virus of illiteracy. We have to do something fundamental -- 
change our goals, our motivation." 
</P>
<P>
That is not an expatriate talking, not an immigrant either. More than anything, 
she sounds like a pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel empowered to be a different kind of writer. The longer I stay here, the 
more light filters into my work. I feel very American. I belong."

<P>
A common gripe among older Americans is that, too often, when they talk to a 
doctor, what they hear is: "It's just old age." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dr. Kenneth Brummel-Smith, USC School of Medicine 
</P>
<P>
Jerald Hoover, 71, remembers that it began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been in perfectly good health, and then one day I started to write a 
note to my son, and I had difficulty beginning simple words. A few days later, 
after I had finished a round of golf, I couldn't add up the score properly. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know it at the time, but they were signs of a stroke." 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Hoover, of Hacienda Heights, happened to be scheduled for his 
annual physical, and mentioned to his family physician of 15 years what had 
happened. The doctor suggested that he also see a neurologist, whose tests 
turned up the fact that the patient had suffered a minor stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Things went downhill from there, Hoover said: "The neurologist put me on 
medication in addition to what my own doctor had put me on. Looking back, I was 
being over-medicated, but didn't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
Over-medication is but one of the complaints of older Americans in their 
relationships with physicians. And doctors, for their part, justifiably feel 
that seniors could often do more to help at this time of their lives when 
health problems are so common. 
</P>
<P>
And all of this happening while the nation's population grows increasingly 
older. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. Edward Schneider, dean of the Andrus Gerontology Center at USC, has 
repeatedly told his colleagues: "Officially or unofficially, you will be in 
geriatrics by the end of the century. Unless you are a pediatrician or an 
obstetrician, the average age of your patients in the year 2000 will be 65 or 
over." In anticipation, curricula at medical, dental and pharmaceutical schools 
are being revised to add more hours dealing with the medical aspects of aging 
and older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But as of now -- although physicians increasingly are more sensitive to the 
special needs of seniors -- everything isn't what it could be. As Hoover can 
attest: 
</P>
<P>
"There should be more communication between older people and their doctors. I 
was taking six different medications. If only my doctors had said: 'Look, 
you've had a minor stroke. The consequences will be as follows. The medicine 
you are on will do this to you. And also you are apt to become depressed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hoover was confused at what ensued: "I found that I didn't give a damn 
about anything. I no longer wanted to play golf. I tried to read and I 
couldn't. I had insomnia. I didn't want to talk to anybody. I just wanted to 
lie around the house." 
</P>
<P>
Then came two dreadful days, about seven months after he had gone for his 
physical, when Hoover reached the point where he went entirely without any 
sleep -- even 10 minutes. "I told my wife, 'I've gotta get some help.' She 
drove me to a hospital, to the emergency section, and I overheard a nurse say: 
'This guy says he can't sleep!' " 
</P>
<P>
But he was admitted for two days, and sleep eventually returned. After that, 
his wife, Betty, enrolled him in a stroke therapy class at another hospital. It 
was there that he heard about the Clinical Gerontology Service of Rancho Los 
Amigos Hospital in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went there, one of their first moves was to take me off all medicines 
except two -- and those two were gradually tapered off and eliminated. Now I 
feel great. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that I had been over-medicated. Not only had my previous two doctors 
apparently not been communicating with each other, they certainly weren't 
telling me anything, not anything I could understand. Whenever I visited them, 
I got the impression they didn't want to see me." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover now has new doctors, and offers this advice to other older Americans: 
</P>
<P>
"Get answers to any questions you may have. If the doctor can't or won't give 
you an answer, get another doctor. In my case, I would very much have liked to 
know more about my stroke, the effects of the medication, and what I could do 
to prevent another one. 
</P>
<P>
"The older you get, the more you should question things. After all, you know 
from experience that diagnosis is the greatest guessing game in existence. 
Don't let yourself be intimidated by your doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Most physicians, however, are aware that the fact of aging may be a stress in 
itself. There is also a reality: "I'm certain that the more frail and 
debilitated the patient, the more difficult it is to convince that person of a 
significant future," said Dr. Morton Glassman of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Glassman, 61, who retired as an internist two years ago ("I was fed up with 
everything"), made another point: "Very often, older people put on the 
physician the disappointment they have to face for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But, he continued, "as an internist, you really are one on one. And I always 
wanted to do the best for any person, regardless of age. The objective of a 
physician is to restore you to the best health possible -- and there shouldn't 
be any differentiation regarding age to achieve this medical ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Is it a factor that treating older people means facing one's own process of 
aging? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, no matter what the age of the doctor, it means coming to terms with your 
own mortality," Glassman said. "At times, this can lead to over-treatment. You 
don't want to let go. Every death is a defeat, from the standpoint that a 
doctor is concerned with the maintenance of life." 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, after 61 years in the general practice of medicine, Dr. A. E. 
Sommer still has that on his mind when he sees his patients three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Sommer, who declined to pinpoint his own age, said he has many patients in 
their 80s, and has empathy for their problems: 
</P>
<P>
"I may discuss with them what may be causing their anxiety or insomnia. 
Sometimes, with the elderly, aloneness can be the cause. Sometimes they live 
alone, and have withdrawn from the world. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my patients is in his 80s and used to play the piano in a band. He has 
a piano in his home, but hasn't touched it for years. I have been putting 
pressure on him to play again, to help give him an interest in keeping going." 
</P>
<P>
Sommer, who is of the "rather wear out than rust out school," takes a daily 
walk, rides a stationary bicycle, and takes adult education courses in Spanish 
and in piano playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to retire, and be reduced to meeting other people my age and 
telling each other of our infirmities," he said. That, he joked, would be "an 
organ recital." 
</P>
<P>
He said that with his older patients, just as with the young people who come in 
to see him, he likes to be unhurried. "I allow time for personal conversation 
-- about their lives, what part of the country they are from, what their 
hobbies are. 
</P>
<P>
"After all these years, my advice to medical students would be to communicate 
and have empathy." 
</P>
<P>
Near the other end of the age spectrum, Dr. William Wake, 34, of Glendale, is a 
family physician whose practice is probably 30% to 40% patients 65 or older. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, traditionally, there have been two groups of physicians who take 
care of older people: 
</P>
<P>
* "There is the technocrat, the specialist who deals in the severe consequences 
of aging. They do their jobs very well, but older patients sometimes find it 
difficult to talk with them. The patients are intimidated. There is respect, 
but no rapport. 
</P>
<P>
* "There are the doctors who (are willing to) hold a patient's hand. . . . They 
should be able to recognize a disease before it becomes overwhelming. And there 
needs to be more preventive medicine. And states such as depression need to be 
recognized and corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future, what is needed is a combination of the two," Wake added. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with older patients, he said, does force a doctor to come to terms with 
his own aging -- even one as young as he, who has been in practice only a few 
years: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I see these patients, my parents and grandparents come to mind. 
I try to be the kind of physician I would want for them." 
</P>
<P>
"Older people, by and large, were brought up in a culture where doctors were 
thought to be omniscient," said Barbara Herzog, director of the Health Care 
Campaign of the Washington, D.C.-based American Assn. of Retired Persons 
(AARP). 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors are, in general, more hesitant to question doctors. But they want 
information. It is a common complaint by them that they don't get enough." 
</P>
<P>
Observers say the potential communication gap looms larger when one considers 
the problem experienced by a growing number of elderly from immigrant groups -- 
the need to find bilingual doctors. 
</P>
<P>
In a booklet entitled "How to Talk to Your Doctor," the UCLA/USC Long Term Care 
Gerontology Center highlights what physicians say about the doctor-patient 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors complain that older patients take more time, are difficult to get 
information from, are difficult to interview, and easily go off on tangents." 
</P>
<P>
The center also points out that "a doctor's time is limited and so is his or 
her patience. So the more specific, direct, positive and simple the question 
is, the more likely the doctor is to respond." 
</P>
<P>
It advises specifics such as: 
</P>
<P>
* "I get a stabbing pain in my right knee when I walk fast. What do you think 
that means? 
</P>
<P>
* "I read about a new treatment for arthritis. Is that something you would 
consider using (for me)?" 
</P>
<P>
* "Is there another pill I can take for this that wouldn't have as many side 
effects?" 
</P>
<P>
For its part, AARP has published a booklet subtitled "Communicating With 
America's Fastest-Growing Patient Group," concerning older Americans and 
directed at physicians. Among the statistics it mentions: 
</P>
<P>
* The 65-plus group spends more than $120 billion yearly on health care needs, 
constituting about 15% of their per-capita income. 
</P>
<P>
* People over 65 average eight visits to the doctor per year, in contrast to 
people under 65, who average about five visits per year. 
</P>
<P>
* Most older patients have at least one chronic condition and many have 
multiple conditions. 
</P>
<P>
* Visits to physicians account for 21% of total health expenditures for older 
people. 
</P>
<P>
* The aging of the population will create a greater demand for physician care. 
The number of physician visits by older Americans is expected to increase by 
47% from 1980 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
AARP suggests to physicians that caring also can be communicated through 
nonverbal means, such as touching a patient's shoulder or back. Also, doctors 
should avoid spatial relationships in which they tower over patients, and 
should move from behind furniture barriers, such as desks, during 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
And another often-neglected consideration: "Many older patients resent being 
called by their first names without their permission, while respecting the 
custom of calling you 'Dr. Surname.' Ask your patient how you should address 
her or him during the initial visit." 
</P>
<P>
Many observers of the medical scene say that relations between older Americans 
and physicians are improving, but there are seniors who distinctly feel 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Cele Gonski, 69, of Panorama City, swears it happened: 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the doctor's office and said I needed something for my lupus. I 
told him about my fatigue and weakness. His reply was to the effect that I 
shouldn't worry about it. I told him he didn't seem to care much about senior 
citizens. He said, 'I guess you're right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gonski said she had been told she has symptoms of lupus, but that her family 
doctor died four years ago. "Since then I've had problems finding a family 
doctor I could talk to." 
</P>
<P>
She said one physician she saw gave her medicine that caused side effects: "I 
developed a bad sore on my leg. When I called about it, they declined to give 
my anything for it. I was afraid to go back there anymore. I doctored myself 
with Epsom salts." 
</P>
<P>
Gonski said another physician told her to write in advance any questions she 
had. "I did this, but I got no answers of any use. All I got was a prescription 
renewal, and was told to come back in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of doctors," she continued. "They keep you in the waiting rooms 
as if you are in a prison . . . When you see them and ask questions about side 
effects of medications, they brush you off." 
</P>
<P>
Gonski has concluded she is disregarded because she is an older American: "When 
I was younger, it seemed the doctors cared more, they took more time with me." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Sorrell, 87, of West Hollywood, had a colostomy 27 years ago after doctors 
found a malignancy. "If I hadn't been able to accept it, I'd have been gone 
long ago," she reflected. "I'm not a fighter, I am an accepter." 
</P>
<P>
Ten months after that operation, she recalled, cancer was found in another part 
of her body, and she took 41 successive cobalt treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"The same two doctors took care of me both times, and they were the best. But 
complications developed with my colostomy, and they recommended another doctor 
for that. He was a nice man, but was very mercenary. It was all a matter of 
money with him. They all have their buddies. They send you from one doctor to 
another. It's nothing but money, money, money." 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell had a complaint common among seniors: "Doctors don't give you any time 
when you are old. Once, when I had an appointment, two girls came in later, and 
they were taken ahead of me. The doctor told me: 'Well, they're young.' 
</P>
<P>
"And when they finally do see you, they'll say: 'You're doing just fine -- come 
back in four weeks.' " 
</P>
<P>
She recalled that "once, after I had waited three hours after my scheduled 
appointment, a doctor told me: 'If we didn't keep a lot of patients in the 
waiting room, people would think we weren't any good.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, Sorrell added: "I'm not afraid of doctors. I think too many of the elderly 
are in awe of them." 
</P>
<P>
Given the relentless graying of the population, what are tomorrow's physicians, 
dentists and pharmacists being taught in today's classrooms? 
</P>
<P>
"Attitudes are changing," said Dr. Kenneth Brummel-Smith, associate professor 
of clinical family medicine at USC and a nationally recognized authority on 
geriatric education for physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all medical schools now offer some training about aging. Many used to 
have none." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, while all medical schools require students to take training in 
pediatrics, probably only 20% require it in geriatrics. And this, he pointed 
out, while people age 65 or older occupy 60% of hospital beds and make up about 
40% of office patients. 
</P>
<P>
Brummel-Smith, also co-chief of the Clinical Gerontology Service at Rancho Los 
Amigos Hospital, reflected on the need for physicians to realize that, in 
addition to clinical medical care, older patients are greatly concerned about 
independence -- jealously guarding the ability to "walk safely, dress 
themselves, feed themselves, care for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
His students also hear variations of something he recently wrote in a 
publication of the American College of Physicians: 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of the responsiveness of older persons to treatment is being 
increasingly well documented. 
</P>
<P>
"From the management of hypertension to the safety of clearly indicated 
elective surgery to preventative interventions such as stopping smoking (even 
after age 70), the older person responds very well." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "the older person will be much more likely to suffer adverse 
effects from treatment if drug dosages or interactions are not carefully 
monitored." 
</P>
<P>
Brummel-Smith said he tells students that, with older patients, doctors often 
must develop consultative relationships with specialists they aren't accustomed 
to using. "They will consult with social workers, home nurses, psychologists." 
</P>
<P>
And there is another area, a sensitive one: 
</P>
<P>
"For the younger patient, the value of saving the life may be primary -- 
something not always true with someone older. You have to listen to what the 
patient wants." Brummel-Smith said a doctor can nearly always assume that what 
a young person wants is total medical intervention, almost no matter what the 
emotional, physical or economic cost. "An older person" he said, "may place a 
value on what kind of life remains." 
</P>
<P>
At the USC School of Medicine, it isn't just lectures and books when it comes 
to dealing with older patients. 
</P>
<P>
"In their first year, (medical students) go in pairs to homes of older 
volunteers to see them and talk with them," the professor said. "Also, in a 
course entitled 'The Family Life Cycle,' we have senior citizens come to the 
classroom and answer questions." 
</P>
<P>
At the USC School of Dentistry, associate professor Dr. RoseAnn Mulligan said 
there is more emphasis at dental schools nationwide on dealing with older 
people: "One reason is that dentists are realizing that such patients will be a 
growing part of their practice. 
</P>
<P>
"And, for their part, seniors now are expecting and demanding dental services, 
unlike in the past, when it was typical to have had all the teeth removed, and 
therefore never have to go to a dentist again." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, also chair of the school's Section of Geriatric and Special Patient 
Dentistry, said today's dental students are taught that older patients usually 
undergo sensory changes, as in hearing and vision: 
</P>
<P>
"We tell the students to sit while talking to the patient in the chair, and at 
face level. A lot of the seniors use lip reading, so it does no good to sit 
next to that person's ear while speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Standing isn't advised, because if the person has arthritis, it may be hard to 
tilt the head and look up. 
</P>
<P>
"Prescription drug dosages must be adjusted," Mulligan added. "You don't give 
the same dose to an elderly patient as you would to a young one." 
</P>
<P>
A number of drugs, such as blood pressure medications, can cause oral changes, 
such as a dry mouth, that may have other repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, "very often a dry mouth in elderly people makes them more 
vulnerable to fungal infections of the mouth," Mulligan explained. "Also, when 
there is diminished saliva, the rate of tooth decay goes up. And if the person 
wears dentures, saliva acts as a cushion. If this is gone, the tissue often is 
abraded. 
</P>
<P>
"And we dispel one of the myths of aging, that as dentists they will have 
difficulty getting work done with older people because they talk too much. That 
isn't true. They want that work done." 
</P>
<P>
Associate professor Dr. Bradley Williams said the USC School of Pharmacy is 
"tripling the content of material which focuses on the aging process and how 
drug therapy interacts with those processes." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Williams disclosed, not only are class instructors being provided with 
course material, but arrangements are being made for outside speakers, such as 
those from the Andrus Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
The professor said he impresses on his students the fact that Americans age 65 
and older make up 12% of the population, but receive 30% of all prescription 
drugs. And they are major consumers of nonprescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The pharmacists of the future will have to be experts in drug therapy to those 
who will be among their major clients." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said student pharmacists are being instructed on: 
</P>
<P>
* "Counseling older clients on the proper use of the medicine being prescribed. 
The doctor may not have done it -- and even if he has, this reinforces the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
* "How the information is provided is as important as the fact that it is. 
There should be a setting of privacy, because health care is a personal matter. 
</P>
<P>
* "Since some of the older clients may have hearing impairment, the setting 
should be in a quiet area where there are few background noises. 
</P>
<P>
* "In counseling, the pharmacist needs to speak slowly and distinctly, and 
should allow the individual to respond or ask questions." 
</P>
<P>
As Williams emphasized: "If an older person is seeing several doctors, each of 
whom may be prescribing independently -- and the person also may be taking 
non-prescription drugs -- the pharmacist is perhaps the only outside individual 
who is aware of all this medication being taken. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the potential problems from drug interaction or side effects, it is 
a pharmacist's duty to advise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW SENIORS CAN GET BETTER MEDICAL CARE 
</P>
<P>
Steps older patients can take to get better care from their doctors: 
</P>
<P>
Take a written list of symptoms to the doctor's office, so nothing is 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, take along a "significant other" for a major appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be afraid to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
If the doctor is unwilling to answer questions, fire him or her and get 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Steps doctors can take to give better care to their older patients: 
</P>
<P>
Talk with the patient about costs. 
</P>
<P>
Discuss the benefits and risks of a given treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Outline what alternatives, if any, are available. 
</P>
<P>
Advise the patient to bring along a "significant other" if the appointment 
concerns something major. The other person can listen, and later help the 
patient remember and discuss the situation. A lot of us don't remember well 
under stress. 
</P>
<P>
Provide a written explanation of diagnosis and treatment that can be taken home 
for further study.

GENDER GAP REMAINS CHASM OF INTRIGUE; 
</P>
<P>
SEXUALITY: BOYS AND GIRLS MAY BE BORN WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POTENTIALS, 
PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY, BUT IT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH THEIR ABILITY THAT'S IMPORTANT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't a woman be more like a man?" Prof. Henry Higgins woefully warbled in 
puzzlement over his fair lady. 
</P>
<P>
If she were, she would be more aggressive, less communicative and die earlier. 
And surely even the irascible professor was not calling for that kind of 
equality of the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the obvious differences -- and vive la difference many would agree with 
the French -- the unique qualities that characterize each of the sexes have 
long fascinated everyone from poets to scientists, from women who wonder why 
men do not share their feelings to men who grumble about women drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Gender differences in such areas as skills, temperament and life span have been 
documented but in many cases disputed. What is inborn and what is learned? How 
much is biological and how much is societal? 
</P>
<P>
"This is the whole story of nature vs. nurture," says Dr. Claude Migeon, who 
heads the pediatric endocrinology clinic at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
"You cannot always tease out one from the other." 
</P>
<P>
While endlessly fascinating, gender differences also have proven troublesome. 
Feminists, for example, naturally are leery of the biology-is-destiny 
implications that in the past have prevented women from pursuing "men's" work. 
And others have argued that the focus should not be on what boys and girls are 
born with, but on how their upbringing may lead them to fall into the 
stereotypical male or female roles. 
</P>
<P>
"What people do with their ability is what's important," says Camilla Benbow, 
an Iowa State University psychologist and researcher in gender differences. 
"Maybe boys and girls come out with slightly different potentials, but how that 
potential is expressed is due to their environment." 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a look at what is known -- and what is not known -- about the 
gender gap, from the moment of conception to death. 
</P>
<P>
In the Womb 
</P>
<P>
The genetic die is cast at conception, but it takes a couple of months before 
the net result becomes apparent. 
</P>
<P>
At fertilization, the sperm carries either an X or a Y chromosome, which 
determines whether the fetus will be female (X) or male (Y). Until the eighth 
to 10th week of gestation, however, the fetus looks female, says Migeon. 
</P>
<P>
In a reverse of the Biblical creation of Adam first and Eve second from one of 
his ribs, males really spring from females, in the genetic sense. 
</P>
<P>
"A man is really a female with testosterone," Migeon says. 
</P>
<P>
At eight to 10 weeks, gender differentiation begins as the fetus develops 
either male or female sex organs. 
</P>
<P>
If the fetus inherited a Y chromosome, it will begin producing testosterone, 
the male hormone that, later in life, is responsible for the physical -- and 
some believe emotional -- characteristics of males, such as larger skeletons, 
facial and body hair. 
</P>
<P>
Babies and toddlers are, of course, much more complicated than fetuses, and 
more susceptible to expectations from parents and others. So it gets trickier 
to identify genetic differences, and say where they come from -- biology or 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
But, experts say, the differences are there. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere around 11 to 12 months, when the mother leaves the room, or puts the 
baby to bed, the girl baby becomes kind of withdrawn into herself; she seems 
sad," says Dr. Taghi Modarressi, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland. 
"But the boy baby becomes hyperactive, thrashing around." 
</P>
<P>
At 17 to 18 months, another difference becomes apparent: Girls begin exhibiting 
a greater facility with language. 
</P>
<P>
"Most girls by that age are able to put two words together," says Modarressi, 
while boys develop that skill a couple of months later. He says girls also 
develop other language skills, such as accumulating a vocabulary and making 
complete sentences, earlier than boys. 
</P>
<P>
Spatial Skills 
</P>
<P>
Boys, by contrast, develop a better perception of space, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you leave children in an ambiguous situation, with ambiguous markers on 
directions," says Modarressi, "the chances for a boy to find the direction out 
is better, as early as 2 or 2 1/2 years of age." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he adds, with the variability of infants and their environments, it is 
hard to pin down the differences or locate their origins. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can really swear by these things," Modarressi says. "It's so subtle; 
it's hard to say. When we talk about inborn, intrinsic maleness and femaleness, 
we really don't know what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly incessant testing that goes on in a child's school life has 
produced a wealth of data for gender researchers. But interpretations of that 
data can prove controversial. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, and in very general terms, males performed better than females on 
math tests while the reverse was true on verbal tests. But recent research 
indicates the gap has narrowed -- although it has remained significant -- in 
math scores and has virtually disappeared in verbal scores. The reasons for 
this are complex and still open to speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed to biological and sociological factors that may come into 
play. Some believe, for example, that the brain is specialized, with the left 
brain responsible for language and the right brain responsible for nonverbal, 
or spatial, skills. Left-handedness, which is believed to correlate to 
right-brain domination, is more prevalent in males, leading to speculation that 
that may be why males generally do better in math and spatial skills tests. 
</P>
<P>
But more attention has been focused on the different signals that parents and 
teachers send to boys and girls in educational matters, and how that might 
contribute to their different accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hypotheses I'm interested in right now is the way women are 
socialized and their belief of how they're going to use math in the future," 
says Nancy Burton, program director for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. "They're 
fine while they're taking a course in it, but they haven't organized their 
thinking to use it in problem solving, which is what the tests test. But I have 
no proof of this." 
</P>
<P>
"Boys and girls, even at very young ages, and who perform equally on math 
tests, have different attitudes toward math. 
</P>
<P>
"As young as third grade, girls say they don't think they're going to use math 
in the future, while boys state that they will." 
</P>
<P>
While hormones are usually viewed in reference to adolescence, when they turn 
boys into men and girls into women, they have a lifelong effect. 
</P>
<P>
The female hormone, estrogen, is believed to keep women alive, on the average, 
longer than men. For women, it forestalls the inevitable march toward death. 
</P>
<P>
"Both women and men die in the end, but the process begins later in women," 
says Dr. David Smith, a Northwestern University expert on longevity. 
</P>
<P>
Besides allowing women to reproduce, estrogen has the added effect of 
stimulating the liver to produce more of the "good" cholesterol, the 
high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs. The male sex hormone testosterone, on the 
other hand, produces more of the "bad" cholesterol, the low-density 
lipoproteins, or LDL. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, says Smith, men have more heart problems and thus die earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason for women's greater life span is societal, he says. Men 
traditionally have engaged in more health- and life-threatening behavior than 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"Men drink more, they smoke more, they participate in violent behavior more, 
they wear seat belts less, they go to the doctor less," he says.

A MODEL SOCIETY BUILT AROUND THE RAILROAD

<P>
Among America's more than 250,000 model railroaders, John Nehrich is a living 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
When he graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1972, he gave up a 
career as a chemist to devote his life to a model railroad layout in the 
basement of a college dorm. 
</P>
<P>
He spends at least 60 hours a week working on the massive layout that he and 
RPI students painstakingly have put together over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Nehrich, 39, is paid $10,000 a year by the RPI student union for his work as 
director and adviser to the Rensselaer Model Railroad Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I live an austere existence. I don't have a car. My home is an inexpensive 
one-room apartment. Sure, I could go out and be a chemist and make a decent 
living, but I don't want to leave the layout," Nehrich explains. 
</P>
<P>
The model railroad in the basement of Davison Hall isn't your run-of-the-mill 
collection of trains, tracks, trestles and tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the largest, finest, most detailed and historically accurate model 
railroad layouts anywhere in the world," says Andy Sperandeo. 
</P>
<P>
Sperandeo ought to know. He's associate editor of the Milwaukee-based bible of 
the hobby, Model Railroader, a 55-year-old monthly with a circulation of 
205,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on the shores of the Hudson River in Upstate 
New York is a 165-year-old school renowned for its engineering program. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of a handful of universities with model railroad clubs. Purdue, 
Syracuse and MIT also have them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, five male students founded the Rensselaer Model Railroad Society. The 
current club roster lists 98 men and two women. 
</P>
<P>
Nehrich joined in 1968 when he was a freshman. Three years later, the 
Rensselaer Model Railroad Society moved to its new location, three huge rooms 
in the dorm basement, and the present layout was launched. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is recreating in miniature a 380-mile railroad route from 
Grand Central Station in New York City to Windsor Station in Montreal with two 
dozen cities and towns along the way depicted with precise historic accuracy," 
explained Nehrich. "We expect it will take another five years to complete." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown areas of the cities and towns are reproduced as they existed Sept. 25, 
1950, complete with tiny figures of people dressed in clothing typical of the 
period. Miniature cars have 1950 license plates. Scaled-down 1950 billboards 
are re-created. 
</P>
<P>
"Railroading was at its peak then. Troy's huge ornate 1910 railroad station was 
jammed with passengers awaiting trains. The depot has been gone for years," 
said Nehrich, sighing as he stood above the model of the town as it was 40 
years ago. "The whole downtown is different today." 
</P>
<P>
Model railroad hobbyists from all over the country make it a point to visit the 
Rensselaer layout. It has been featured in Model Railroader and other 
publications. Among model railroaders it is one of the best-known layouts in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The layout is open Saturdays to the public. "One Saturday 600 people were 
jammed in the basement. They could hardly budge," recalled Nehrich. 
</P>
<P>
Every other Sunday club members meet to spend hours re-enacting true-to-life 
railroad activities such as "making up" trains, moving cargo, running passenger 
schedules, and servicing engines in roundhouses. 
</P>
<P>
The club has 50 engines, nearly 500 cars. It takes a half hour for a train to 
negotiate the entire run. At times as many as 20 trains are operating 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Trains pass through walls from room to room, through tunnels, over trestles and 
causeways, by mountains covered with dense miniature forests in vivid fall 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
Previous members, some dating back to the club's beginning 42 years ago, 
frequently drop by to help work on the layout. Ray Hessinger, 22, who was last 
year's club president, graduated in June and took a job as a civil engineer in 
nearby Albany so he could continue to work with the trains. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like John Nehrich. I can't see myself living away from the layout," said 
Hessinger, who spends all his free time in the dorm basement. 
</P>
<P>
The RPI students aren't the only model fanatics. A recent survey by Model 
Railroader revealed that hobbyists spent more than $200 million last year on 
the pastime. The survey showed a steadily increasing interest in model 
railroading, up 20% over five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For some, like John Nehrich, model railroading is an obsession. "I can't get 
enough of it," he admits. "I never want to do anything else. My ambitions are 
consumed by this layout."

'BENCH IS HELEN'S ONLY HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie Herzog's article "Bench Is Helen's Only Home" (Nov. 3) is a sad 
illustration of the increasing problem caused by the closure of the state 
hospitals and the change in laws relating to the mentally ill and 
developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Civil and human rights advocates have insisted that all people have a right to 
live as they chose, and the laws made it almost impossible to detain someone in 
a hospital for his own protection. If they are not suicidal or homicidal, 14 
days is the maximum stay. These advocates, however well intentioned, have 
overlooked an important aspect: that along with rights comes responsibility. If 
a person cannot be responsible for food, clothing and shelter for themselves, 
then should they have the right to live on the street? 
</P>
<P>
Community programs were to be the answer for this problem, and it was assumed 
that the former patients would avail themselves of the services provided -- and 
some have done so. But many others chose not to participate in any program. 
When there is no way to enforce participation, a program is useless. 
</P>
<P>
The pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. It is time for some 
advocates to begin to lobby for a change in the laws, and a reopening of the 
state hospitals. Of course we don't want people inappropriately hospitalized, 
but when they prove that they can't be responsible for themselves, we will 
again have to assume that responsibility.

NEIGHBORLY SUGGESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the most serious of subjects sometimes lends itself to a little gallows 
humor. Such it is with last week's proposal to build a new Orange County jail 
in, of all places, Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth revealed that he had been talking for a 
year to a Riverside County supervisor about building the jail at a remote 
location in the neighboring county to be jointly operated by the two counties. 
It would, Roth said, obviate the need for a jail in Gypsum Canyon east of 
Anaheim Hills -- an area he represents. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's constituents vehemently oppose the Gypsum Canyon site, saying in part 
they believe it would be too far from criminal courts in Santa Ana and would 
make busing inmates to court hearings costly. 
</P>
<P>
But, leaving aside the merits of the regional jail idea, we know Roth's 
constituents wouldn't mind busing inmates into and out of Riverside County. 
We're sure they would be happy to support a jail that puts the Gypsum Canyon 
proposal on ice forever. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley should start negotiating with Riverside 
County supervisors too. They might have some more remote acreage to accommodate 
the new regional airport location Orange County has been searching for all 
these years.

TRAFFIC IN THE SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Newton's article (Oct. 30) on the problems of Mission Viejo caused by the 
development going on around the south Orange County area is a well-expressed 
view of our city's concern about the traffic problem posed by this population 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
The puzzling thing about this article, though, is how anyone can do any 
research, whatsoever, on this subject without underlining and repeatedly 
emphasizing the obvious lack of responsibility by Orange County's supervisors 
for permitting this development without first assuring that transportation 
access was adequate to cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
In this responsibility, our supervisors have been deplorably remiss.

VOTER ATTITUDES ON RAISING TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although neither group wants to believe it, California's elected officials and 
its journalists are very much alike in one respect: Both consistently 
underestimate and misread California's voters. 
</P>
<P>
The best example ever was in how both politicians and press misread the voters' 
intents in passing Proposition 13, which led to a major reduction in property 
taxes as well as to stringent new requirements for levying new taxes. That 
movement was characterized as a simple-minded, gut-level reaction against 
taxes, even taxes for our children's education. 
</P>
<P>
Not true! The driving element of that fiscal change was an intent to change how 
taxes were collected, not an intent to hurt our kids. We voters didn't -- and 
don't -- want to be taxed on our homes, which represent our life savings. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the politicos nor the writers got the message that time. Did they think 
we were too simple to reason at that level? 
</P>
<P>
Now, we in Orange County are seeing it happen again. Proposition M fails and 
the immediate official and unofficial responses are that Orange County won't go 
for new taxes, even for the roads we need. 
</P>
<P>
Not true again! Those of us who read the proposition realized that much of the 
funding would go for new freeway lanes -- but diamond lanes we'd be forced to 
pay for and then not be allowed to use. 
</P>
<P>
We are already offended that gasoline taxes, once reserved for roads, were 
diverted into the general fund under Cranston's leadership. We're already 
offended that existing highway funds are being spent on lanes we are kept from 
using. And, finally, we're offended that we were expected to be simple-minded 
enough to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
Try it again, M, but this time separate rails from roads and diamonds from 
asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Give us some credit. We will vote for school taxes if they are justified, just 
not for property taxes for schools. And we will vote for freeways, just not for 
diamond lanes.

TUSTIN ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the article on the Tustin City Council election (Nov. 2): 
</P>
<P>
Tustin citizens have a golden opportunity to improve the council's quality and 
effectiveness if final approval is given to moving municipal elections up to 
April next year, instead of delaying until November. 
</P>
<P>
Elections in April will allow voters to concentrate specifically on Tustin, 
without being distracted by the many state propositions and national and state 
candidates and issues. 
</P>
<P>
Because April elections are less costly for candidates, they allow more people 
to run, thus typically providing a larger field of office seekers from which to 
choose, and making it less likely that only those with ties to special 
interests will campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those opposed to April elections refer to additional costs to the 
"taxpayer." But in reality, the expense of April elections is only about 25 
cents per citizen, a minuscule amount compared to the millions of dollars that 
have been at stake, and lost, to the city in recent months. Moreover, cost is 
usually not the real reason for opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents, for example, know they have a much better chance for reelection if 
their record is obscured as voters are overwhelmed with the last-minute 
scramble to go through national and state campaign materials in November. 
Obviously, in an April election, voters have a greater chance of clearly 
knowing the issues and candidates. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Tustin will benefit by an early opportunity to have our 
very own elections, again.

THE HUNTINGTON BEACH PROPOSAL FOR GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't quite understand why there is opposition to the proposed municipal golf 
course planned for a few acres of abandoned oil fields and some foreclosed 
mushroom fields in the vicinity of Ellis and Golden West streets in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that a few members of the affluent horse crowd or a small handful 
of joggers who are using the area illegally are the vocal protesters? This area 
is posted as off-limits to all. 
</P>
<P>
I know that the few transients who occupy the existing sheds and lean-tos would 
like to keep it as it is. My suggestion is, keep your daughters away from this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
To the bird watchers and nature lovers who would like to keep the Ellis and 
Golden West area as it is, be careful. You might catch a virus, which one 
police officer described as a case of passive nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
What a tremendous opportunity to convert this useless tax burden to an extended 
greenbelt that would provide recreation to a potential 13,000 golfers, or 7% of 
the residents of the city. And this is all unsubsidized and self-supporting, 
which is something more than other Central Park users can say.

POLLING PLACE GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe that the district attorney's office made a mistake in investigating 
the 20 security guards involved at the Santa Ana polling stations. It was a 
waste of time because the guards were hired and were following orders from the 
Orange County Republican officials, headed by Tom Fuentes. These are the people 
to be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
What an excuse by the Republican Party. It's outrageous. This means that the 
party can take the law and play judge, jury and executioner. Hasn't Tom Fuentes 
heard that we have police and sheriff's departments to handle such supposed 
incidents? 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republican officials made a grave and, I am sure, an intentional 
mistake. They should pay for it.

THE HUNTINGTON BEACH PROPOSAL FOR GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurray for members of Save Our Parks. They are right when they say to let the 
voters decide how Central Park is developed. 
</P>
<P>
It really burns me up when I read how the mayor says what a great deal the 
proposed golf course is. A great deal for whom? Twenty-five percent of the park 
will be a golf course. Twenty-five percent of public land will be gated off and 
non-usable by 92% of the residents for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's math is amazing. Why can't the county build a regional park across 
the street for $13,000 per acre when the mayor says it would cost $190,000 per 
acre for Central Park? The golf course with all the bells and whistles is less 
than $50,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Our mayor wants to be state insurance commissioner? Get the chickens in a 
circle -- the colonel's about to attack!

SPOTLIGHTING 'WHAT EVERYWOMAN KNOWS'; 
</P>
<P>
LONG-TOURING ONE-WOMAN STAGE PRODUCTION HAS A 15-YEAR HISTORY 
</P>

Tulis McCall knows women's history: "I think the big changes happened with the 
Industrial Revolution, when men left home, left women out and made money. When 
the industry was at home, everything was shared." 
</P>
<P>
Tulis knows acting: "Every actor should perform for children, because that's an 
audience that wastes no time letting you know how they feel." 
</P>
<P>
Tulis knows touring: "I've toured for the past 15 years in 40 states, from 
meetings of the National Organization for Women to Girl Scout conventions." 
</P>
<P>
Tulis knows . . . lights? During a problematic shot for a photo session at the 
West Coast Ensemble in Hollywood, the current home of her long-touring 
one-woman play, "What Everywoman Knows," she helped out the photographer with 
some instructions to the tech booth. "Bring up lights eight and 11," she said 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson may know hockey, but Tulis McCall isn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Joanna was very impressed with my, ahem, technical expertise," McCall, 39, 
said of her director, Joanna Kerns. "But when you're quickly moving a show 
around from one place to another, you better have your lighting down or else 
you may not have a show." 
</P>
<P>
What appears to be just another solo actress turn in a small Hollywood theater 
actually has an unusual history. Appropriately enough for a play that tells the 
stories of indomitable, pre-modern American women, the life of "What Everywoman 
Knows" is a case of an independent theater person chucking the typical 
show-business career ladder for a different course. 
</P>
<P>
"My big motivation for doing this was really easy: I hate auditioning," she 
said, as if this was the obvious weapon to combat the actor's universal bete 
noir. But how does one begin to tell the history of American women? 
</P>
<P>
"It was like what happens to a lot of writers. An image popped into my mind. 
There she was, a woman draped in a shawl and sitting in a chair. This was my 
character, Everywoman. And then, I knew she wasn't quite human but sort of a 
visitor from another planet, able to see all. And her voice could instantly 
blend every regional dialect." 
</P>
<P>
Everywoman would become the evening's hostess, the ingratiating, down-home 
guide through the stories. "She's a nicer version of me. I was born 
complaining, so doing her is a real exercise." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest stretch would be to choose which women to stage, "because there 
were so many of them. Touring this for many years now, I've gone through 
several, and the nature of it could let me do this show forever if I wanted. It 
also lets me change the show, while keeping its basic character." 
</P>
<P>
The changes continue. On opening weekend, McCall was performing presidential 
candidate Victoria Woodhull, abortion rights activist Margaret Sanger, the 
notorious Calamity Jane and emancipationist Sojourner Truth. The following 
week, McCall rewrote parts of Calamity's scene, added a section with the 
colonial religious freedom fighter, Anne Hutchinson, and rearranged the order 
of the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that McCall has lived with her play, changes and all, for some 15 
years. One night, she might play for a convention of feminist historians; the 
next, to a crowd of hundreds of schoolboys. Along the way, parents and 
administrators at private schools would object to the work's rather liberated 
slant. Or a group might not get the point, which is that women are strong 
enough on their own two feet, without losing their sense of humor. Or teen-age 
girls in the audience would ply McCall for dating advice ("It was OK, since the 
show was making them think about what they wanted"). Like Calamity Jane in her 
touring days, McCall has been a self-employed performer, having a relationship 
with her play. 
</P>
<P>
So it's surprising to hear her taking these new, rather sudden changes in 
stride. This is partly because Kerns and producer Dan Lauria suggested them, 
and McCall fully admits she wouldn't be 3,000 miles from her New York home 
without Lauria's support. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a case of old friends reunited, for McCall and Lauria knew each other 
in the '70s, when both were at the University of Connecticut. Lauria, who 
produced another recently lauded solo theater piece, "A Bronx Tale," and plays 
the father on the television series, "The Wonder Years," wanted to bring McCall 
out to Los Angeles last year, but the money couldn't be raised until summer. 
"He hangs curtains, paints wall; he's not your typical producer," the 
actress-writer said. "Dan says that there's no reason to make money unless he 
can get your friends work. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I have Joanna giving me endless questions to go home and chew on. These 
women are new to her, and her excitement about them is energizing." 
</P>
<P>
She realizes that Kerns is experiencing what McCall grew up with: the seductive 
charm of natural storytellers weaving a yarn of life's travails. "My family was 
full of them," McCall said. "We're Irish-Catholics, so if you're telling a 
tale, you've got to be good and fast. Every time my Uncle Billy and Aunt Ginny 
visited, I fought with my brothers over who would sit next to them, so we could 
hear their latest story. I didn't realize until later, of course, that they 
weren't about pleasant events." 
</P>
<P>
Which is the link to women's history, a litany of unpleasantness. McCall 
credits Eleanor Flexner's book, "Century of Struggle," for the show's 
background and her high school history teacher for her passion for the past. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget that women were tarred and feathered and raped for speaking 
their minds," said McCall. "Pacifist women protesting U. S. involvement in 
World War I blockaded the White House, were arrested, put in insane asylums and 
force-fed during their hunger strikes. This history hasn't been told enough, 
which is deliberate, for if you take away someone's past, you take away their 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," McCall said, employing an Everywoman-like overview, "it doesn't 
serve anyone's interest to deny anyone else their rights. But while they do, 
like Everywoman says, 'You have to be crabby for a long, long time.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a real sense, McCall -- who has written another one-woman show, "Bless Me, 
Father!" and is in the midst of writing a multicharacter play, "Blind Ambition" 
-- is invoking her own "crabbiness" on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say to any challengers in my audience, 'Look, history is written. This is 
my version of history. If you don't like it, then write your own version!' " 
</P>

RESTAURANT A FITTING PLACE FOR FABLES WITH DOG-EAT-DOG HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an evening of food and theater Thursday, as Pacific Palisades' Lido 
Ristorante presents a dinner and reading of Oscar Mandel's "The Gobble-Up 
Stories," a selection of fables performed by actress Maylou Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"A fable has to be relatively brief," said the Belgian-born Mandel. "It's a 
dramatic story -- very often with animals, but not necessarily. It comes to a 
real point, and the point is a moral of some kind, some observation. 
Philosophical, yes. A fable is always philosophical: philosophy as 
entertainment. It's moral instruction in the form of little stories. But 
there's no connection between them. Just as when you read Aesop, they're 
individual ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Mandel, who began writing fables in 1960, has performed them on a number of 
occasions and in a variety of venues -- -- and with different scripts. "They 
exist in two versions," he noted. "When they are performed by one person, they 
are called 'The Gobble-Up Stories.' When two or more people perform them, they 
are 'The Kukkurrik Fables.' " 
</P>
<P>
They were conceived solely as literary pieces. It was almost a year afterward 
that Mandel realized: "My heavens, they're full of dialogue. One can make 
little plays out of them." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sullivan performed the fables at Venice's Sculpture Garden 
Restaurant, where the program was preceded by the meal. 
</P>
<P>
"People had dined very well and drunk wine," said Mandel, 62. "Frankly, they 
were sleepy. So we're doing it differently this time. The hors d'oeuvres will 
be served first. Then we'll bring out Maylou, who does a selection -- about 50 
minutes to an hour. When that's finished, we have the main course, dessert and 
coffee. This way, people won't be starved; they'll still be awake. And the 
owner, Hedy Ciani, promises a spectacular meal." 
</P>
<P>
Mandel himself will be available afterward to chat with the patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the meeting," he said. "I've often done it in the past. Once I was 
reading the material myself, and a woman told me her mother had read 'The 
Gobble-Up Stories' during her last illness, and it gave her so much pleasure. 
It's that kind of conversation that can be so moving -- even though they're 
very cruel stories. 
</P>
<P>
"They're called the 'The Gobble-Up Stories' because they're very Darwinian, in 
terms of people gobbling up each other, dog eat dog. But they're humorous, so 
people think they're charming." About 10 of Mandel's collection of 45 fables 
will be read in Thursday's program. 
</P>
<P>
The original fable was prompted by an irate letter from a friend, accusing the 
writer of a breach of literary ethics, "and quoting Plato, Kant and Spinoza." 
Mandel said, "I thought it was very amusing, a great artillery on a very small 
target. For some reason, this led to a fable, 'How God Learned What Measure 
Is.' From that point on, I had one idea after another for different fables." 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of numerous essays, translations and a dozen plays, Mandel is a 
Fulbright scholar and graduate of New York University and Columbia; he has 
taught at Ohio State University, the University of Nebraska -- and since 
resettling in Los Angeles in 1961, has been professor of humanities at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
"Were all together: economists, political scientists and historians," he said 
genially of Caltech's humanities and social sciences departments. "I love my 
teaching. It's very social, very gratifying. We're teaching 18- to 22-year-old 
youngsters who are very, very intelligent, but who haven't read much. So you 
have to interest them, educate them, perform for them. It's a drive, yes. But I 
do a lot of thinking on the freeway. I get some of my better ideas on 
freeways." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Belgian diamond dealer who relocated his family to New York in 
1940, Mandel discovered writing on his own. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't always been easy. "I have trouble getting my stuff produced," Mandel 
admitted. "People are looking for realistic, gritty, trailer-park-in-Pacoima 
things, and the plays I write are grand, imaginative stories. I guess the word 
for it -- it's very old-fashioned -- is patrician." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Thursday's program are $50 a person, and include the entertainment, 
dinner, tax and tip. The all-imported menu begins with two antipastos: 
bocconcini di bufalo with radicchio and pecorino Toscano with arrugola, 
followed by pasticcio with porcini alla medici, insalata fiorentina and 
insalata della nonna, homemade focaccio bread, choice of carre di vitello 
farcito ai porcini or scampi versilia, assorted homemade desserts, pinot grigio 
and merlot wines, coffee, tea and capuccino. Seating is limited. For 
reservations, call (213) 459-9214.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: THE OLD SOUTH, LOUISIANA-STYLE, LIVES AT PATOUT'S; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY BRINGS THE FLAVORS OF THE BIG EASY TO THE BIG ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
I realized something about Louisiana food the night I couldn't get out of my 
chair. It was at a dinner party in New Orleans where the main course, crab meat 
in mornay sauce plus artichoke hearts and hard-cooked egg yolks, provided a 
generous platform for mass quantities of wine. These people were keen fanciers 
of bargain-priced Bordeaux -- if they'd been born in California they'd live at 
Trader Joe's. 
</P>
<P>
Between the crab Colbert and the wine and probably a couple of Sazerac 
cocktails, when it came time to leave I actually needed help standing up, and 
my date had to drive me to my hotel. She told me not to apologize. She was used 
to driving people home from dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Paul Prudhomme, Californians basically think of Louisiana food as 
spicy, although one look at Prudhomme's heroic girth should warn you that it's 
also a very rich cuisine, having a lot in common with the sort of Southern 
cooking where the aim is to make everything into a rich, savory, aromatic mush. 
</P>
<P>
Patout's is the place for that sort of Louisiana cooking around here. It's 
definitely the most Southern-like Louisiana restaurant in our town. Apart from 
the fern leaves on the walls in lieu of wallpaper, the notable things about the 
decor are the Spanish moss hanging from the ceiling and the photos on the wall: 
photos of fine old Southern homes, not photos of Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Patout family is from Louisiana and does make very impressive 
Cajun and Creole food. For instance, Eugene on the Bayou, a chicken breast 
stuffed with a crab mixture which has the real Louisiana flavor, rich and 
crabby. Patout's makes an excellent version of that most dashing of Louisiana 
appetizers, shrimp remoulade. The sauce, like a cocktail sauce that makes back 
talk, is mostly hot paprika mixed with whole-seed mustard and tarragon vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
One of New Orleans' habits is topping some simple meat dish with crab meat 
(always lump crab meat, never the stringy stuff). Patout's does this on a 
regular basis with chicken Elizabeth, chicken breast in a rich sauce of reduced 
cream with a crown of lump crab meat. I've also had a veal special that was 
essentially wienerschnitzel with crab meat and reduced cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive entree to me, though, is ladyfish, which is closer to the 
Prudhomme end of the spectrum. It's a Gulf of Mexico red snapper (all Patout's 
seafood is flown in from the Gulf), rubbed with spices and grilled, served with 
shrimp and crab meat in a lemon vermouth sauce. You can also get this dish in a 
combo called Lady Patout with tournedos Patout, which is beef filet on a round 
of eggplant with crunchy-fresh shrimp and the hot, smoky flavor of the cured 
meat product called Tasso. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing I've had here that didn't work was catfish Linda and that was 
because part of the fish had developed a slight chlorine flavor, as catfish 
will do on a couple of hours' notice. A shame, because the pecan-butter sauce 
was, well, rich and aromatic. 
</P>
<P>
Of course Patout's has frighteningly rich desserts. A big cube of bread pudding 
with bourbon-butter sauce. Several pecan pies: one with a layer of sweet 
potato, and another that is the only really successful chocolate pecan pie I've 
ever had, the gooey, molasses-rich filling somehow bearing the additional load 
of chocolate. Surprisingly, Patout's serves one of the most intense chocolate 
cakes around, an "almost flourless chocolate cake" with a strong bitter 
chocolate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Patout's has had some shake-ups lately, what with sister Gigi Patout going off 
to work at Angeli (is a Cajun calzone in the works?). Still, not much has 
changed in Patout's food, except that the chicken and sausage gumbo seems to 
have improved. Patout's old gumbo had the effect of being just chicken soup, 
but the current one has all the dark, earthy aromas of major gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
It is still a place for rich Southern cooking with no real rival in Los 
Angeles. Take some of the seafood items: oysters Alexander (oysters with shrimp 
and bread crumbs, baked on the half shell), crab a la Eugene (crab with 
mushrooms and bread crumbs, baked in a crab shell) and seafood eggplant (shrimp 
and crab and bread crumbs on a bed of fried eggplant). All savory, aromatic 
and, above all, rich. You can order all three in a combo called seafood Patout, 
which also includes broiled shrimp in vermouth lemon butter sauce, some shrimp 
and okra gumbo and a plate of red beans and okra on the side. 
</P>
<P>
You can also find somebody else to drive you home, because I'm definitely busy 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: chicken and sausage gumbo, $4/$6; shrimp remoulade, $4/$7; 
Eugene on the bayou, $18; ladyfish, $22; chocolate pecan pie, $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Patout's, 2260 Westwood Blvd., West Los Angeles. (213) 475-7100. Open for 
lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, for dinner 6-10 p.m. 
Sunday through Thursday, till 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday; Sunday brunch 11 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Full bar. Street parking. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner 
for two, food only, $36 to $72.

NIGHT MOVES: BON APPETIT AND A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
THE WESTWOOD RESTAURANT'S ADDITION OF CONTEMPORARY JAZZ/FUSION IN THE EVENING 
IS DRAWING A SOLID CLIENTELE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
David Gimpel isn't big on sitting still. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent conversation in his office above the Bon Appetit restaurant in 
Westwood, Gimpel was a man in motion, shifting from a straight-back, 
tennis-shoed-feet-on-the-floor pose to a slouch with his legs spinning a nearby 
swivel chair. Occasionally he plopped his elbow on his desk and rested his head 
in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Gimpel's demeanor mirrors his business life. "I need growth, I need 
</P>
<P>
challenges," the 30-year-old co-owner of Bon Appetit said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Westside restaurant may do the trick. Bon Appetit sports a strong lunch 
crowd and a solid clientele in the evening for the contemporary jazz/fusion 
that Gimpel offers. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, which Gimpel's father opened in 1977 (on the heels of the first 
Bon Appetit, which the senior Gimpel started in Beverly Hills in 1973), was 
simply an eatery until 1984. And although the lunch trade was always good, not 
too many folks thought of the establishment as a dinner house. 
</P>
<P>
"Many nights, we'd close at 9 p.m.," David Gimpel said. 
</P>
<P>
So, five years ago last January, he brought in the music on Friday and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the idea of entertainment," he said. "I knew that Westwood needed 
something different and that we needed to be competitive. The original 
intention was to be a cabaret, but I found I really didn't care for singers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the early backup bands was led by a keyboard player named Gregg 
Karukas, whose little trio was a lot better than the vocalists he was backing," 
Gimpel said. "I asked Gregg to come in just with his band, no singers, and we 
found it was a lot easier to work with. I didn't have to be constantly manning 
the sound system and so on. And people really enjoyed it. So that was where I 
discovered contemporary jazz." 
</P>
<P>
In about a year and a half, the music scene at Bon Appetit eventually grew to 
seven nights a week, and Gimpel was booking many of the acts he now regularly 
features: guitarist Pat Kelley, the San Diego-based Fattburger, saxman Brandon 
Fields, drummer Alphonse Mouzon and Karukas. But it was in January, 1987, when 
Gimpel instigated a series of live-from-the-club broadcasts on KKGO-FM (105.1) 
that Bon Appetit really got on the map. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Carlton was our first act" on the broadcasts "and from the moment the 
first commercial aired advertising him, the phone didn't stop ringing." 
</P>
<P>
Gimpel, who said he's not the "greatest mainstream fan," believes that jazz/pop 
fusion is the genre with which he and his customers are most comfortable. "We 
don't go too far out," said the man who also operates Nova Records, a 
contemporary jazz line with 29 releases, out of his offices at Bon Appetit. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor a sort-of Kenny G-ish pop fusion sound, sometimes a little on the 
funk/R&amp;B side, but we shy away from real intense fusion. I like good 
original music that spotlights melody. I want to hear the musicians' creative 
spark, feature them as composer, as artist, rather than as a player, so we 
don't have people come in who just play cover versions of jazz/pop standards. 
We feature original music, the same kind of music I record on my label." 
</P>
<P>
Like most club operators, Gimpel receives a slew of demo tapes from hopefuls 
looking for a spot on his schedule. He gives them all a listen, though that 
listen may be as short as 10 seconds if it's a shoddy offering. "When a group 
is ready to walk out into the marketplace, it should do it professionally, like 
with a nice demo tape, not a live tape recorded off a club gig," he advised. "I 
get a lot of garage tapes with terrible sound quality." 
</P>
<P>
Bon Appetit serves continental cuisine from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and has had the 
same chef, Jose Martinez, for nine years. The entrees include poached king 
salmon with saffron sauce, fettuccine with grilled chicken and basil pesto, and 
Guatemalan-style chicken breast cooked in a spicy tomatillo/cilantro sauce. 
These are priced between $13 and $15. Early evening dinners, served from 5 to 7 
p.m., are $7.95. There is also a wide array of meat and fowl dishes, pastas and 
salads. Cover charges vary from $5 to $12, depending on the group and the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
After his talk with a visitor, Gimpel went downstairs to make sure that 
everything was going smoothly for the evening's performer, guitarist Norman 
Brown. Around the room, which seats 80, about half the tables were occupied. 
</P>
<P>
As Brown started playing his jazz/funk originals such as "Sweet Taste" and 
"Just for Fun," Gimpel made adjustments with the sound system and then stood 
back, arms folded across his chest, and listened. As Brown held forth, more 
people arrived and others stopped outside the club and checked out Brown and 
his cohorts through the windows, which open onto the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied that things were going well, Gimpel chatted for a few minutes with 
friends, then walked down Broxton Avenue to his car. He'd been at the club 
since 8 a.m., and it was now past 10 p.m., and he was tired. 
</P>
<P>
"I did get a nap in though, since I live right near here," he said laughing. 
"Though I'm not always around at night, I do spend a lot of time here. But that 
may change soon. I'm moving from Westwood to West Hollywood. I just had to get 
farther away from the club so I wouldn't be tempted to come back here to take 
care of things, like if a musician left something behind and wanted me to open 
up at 2 a.m., which I'd usually do. This way maybe I can separate myself a 
little bit, but the trouble is my new place will be too far away for me to go 
home and grab that nap."

Wimp-baiting has been a factor in American politics since early in the 
republic's history, and the result has been a "compulsive masculinity" among 
recent Presidents, says a professor who has studied the wimp factor in history. 
</P>
<P>
The wimp theme has persisted since Thomas Jefferson, who was called "womanish," 
through Martin Van Buren, who was accused of wearing corsets and taking too 
many baths, and George Bush, who had to battle what Newsweek magazine called 
"The Wimp Factor" in a 1988 cover story that asked if he could overcome it. 
</P>
<P>
Adlai E. Stevenson III, the Democrats' candidate against war hero Dwight D. 
Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, was called "Adelade," and Walter F. Mondale, who 
ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984, had to confront bumper stickers that said 
"Mondale Eats Quiche." Quiche is considered wimp food, unsuitable for manly 
presidential palates. Ask Bush, who made a campaign point of eating manly pork 
rinds, their cholesterol count be damned. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Curtis, who teaches American thought and language at Michigan State 
University, says in an age that is less muscular than the past, Presidents have 
felt obliged to reveal themselves as tough and their opponents as sissies. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the ideal masculine man is further removed from reality than ever, 
many nostalgic men, and not a few nostalgic women, demand that our public 
leaders appear more masculine than ever," he says in an article in the November 
issue of American Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he says, is for politicians to assert their virility. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he says, no President has been more "earthily vulgar" than Lyndon B. 
Johnson, who ridiculed opponents of his Vietnam policies as "nervous Nellies." 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon reached for a pugilistic metaphor to describe his "kitchen 
debate" with Nikita S. Khrushchev, saying he felt he had been "up against a 
bare-knuckle slugger who had gouged, kneed and kicked." 
</P>
<P>
"Even Jimmy Carter, among recent Presidents seemingly the least driven by 
machismo, revealed during the 1988 campaign his susceptibility to its public 
demands by remarking that Bush seemed rather 'effeminate,' " Curtis noted. 
</P>
<P>
In his day, Carter, too, was accused of acting like a wimp. In a famous 
mistake, the Boston Globe went to press in 1980 with an editorial bearing a 
prankish headline that had not been intended to see the light of day: "More 
Mush from the Wimp." 
</P>
<P>
To offset perceived wimpishness, candidates often talk tough. 
</P>
<P>
Bush bragged, the day after his 1984 vice presidential debate with Geraldine A. 
Ferraro, that he had "kicked a little ass." 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Roosevelt, outraged that Woodrow Wilson initially shied away from 
plunging America into World War I, said what Wilson had done was "to emasculate 
American manhood." Ronald Reagan, threatening to veto a bill if Congress sent 
it to him, borrowed a line from movie strongman Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make 
my day." 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Century, reformers were ridiculed as "namby-pamby, goody-goody 
gentlemen" who "sip cold tea." Andrew Jackson, the war hero and Indian fighter, 
described another politician as "Miss Nancy." Jefferson was called "womanish" 
because he "took counsel of his feelings and imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson was "Adelade" to the New York Daily News, which also said he "used 
teacup words" and had the support of "Harvard lace-liberals" and "lace-panty 
diplomats." 
</P>
<P>
The need to prove himself tough sent Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrats' 
presidential candidate last year, into a tank turret for the filming of a 
campaign commercial that backfired; Dukakis didn't look like he belonged there. 
</P>
<P>
Bush fought to overcome "the wimp factor" although there was an occasional 
lapse. Once he was overheard saying he'd have "just another splash" of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Women in politics, like Ferraro or Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who shed 
tears when she withdrew as a candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination in 1988, "are condemned no matter what they do," Curtis wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"If gentle, they are womanish; if tough, they are not womanly. By tradition a 
female cannot be a courageous, charismatic, wise, effective leader as a woman." 
</P>
<P>
"The point," concludes Curtis, "is not that the 'manly' characteristics of the 
myth -- courage, assertiveness in the face of aggression, righteous defense of 
the weak -- are undesirable or dangerous in themselves. The cinematic myth is 
dangerous because it is labeled 'for men only' and because it may be distorted 
and debased by actors on the public scene."

DO NUMBERS ADD UP ON ILLEGAL ENTRY?; 
</P>
<P>
BORDER: A SURGE IN ARRESTS OF ILLEGAL CROSSERS ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER IS 
CAUSING CONCERN FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, BUT OTHERS SAY THE FIGURES HAVE 
LITTLE MEANING.

<P>
Already, U.S. authorities have begun a renewed sounding of the alarm bells. 
After 2 1/2 years of steady declines following passage of the sweeping 1986 
immigration reform package, arrests of undocumented foreign nationals along the 
U.S.-Mexico border have begun to surge, signaling a possible renewed wave of 
illegal entries, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Between May and September, U.S. border guards from San Diego to Brownsville, 
Tex., recorded more than 435,000 apprehensions of the undocumented, a jump of 
almost one-quarter over the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are going up, and we're concerned," said Duke Austin, spokesman in 
Washington for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. "It's something 
we're watching closely." 
</P>
<P>
But the warning of an emerging trend is based on statistics -- arrests along 
the border -- that, although widely repeated, also are widely questioned. The 
arrest numbers, critics argue, are so volatile because of a range of factors -- 
among them INS staffing and priorities, seasonal shifts in migration, and 
changes in policy and law -- that using them to buttress any point can be 
highly misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the figures' value has always been very problematic," said Wayne A. 
Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego and 
a leading researcher of immigration issues. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the border arrest statistics have long been trumpeted by INS officials as 
the single most effective indicator of illegal immigration. For decades, the 
numbers have served a central role in U.S. immigration strategy. During the 
1950s, as in the 1980s, rising arrests led inexorably to crackdowns and calls 
for new controls. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers' always-suspect reliability, analysts say, has eroded further since 
passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the most 
far-reaching overhaul of U.S. immigration law in two decades. Several 
provisions of that statute have clearly had a direct impact on border arrests, 
which dropped after passage of the law until the recent surge. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the law's legalization or amnesty provisions resulted in 
more legal border crossings, possibly contributing to a parallel decline in 
illegal entries. And the law gave new responsibilities to U.S. immigration 
authorities, drawing some personnel away from border enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials, especially former commissioner Alan C. Nelson, have been quick 
to seize upon the post-1986 drop in arrests as evidence that new penalties 
against employers who hire undocumented workers successfully stemmed illegal 
immigration. The so-called employer sanctions -- a centerpiece of the 1986 law 
-- were meant to dry up the undocumented job market. 
</P>
<P>
But skeptical researchers, aware of the lack of success of similar sanctions in 
various U.S. states (including California) and in Europe, say the agency's 
logic is specious. Undocumented workers have easily managed to circumvent the 
new requirements by using false documents and other means, according to several 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics, notably Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern 
Frontier, a Tijuana-based research institution, have argued that the INS has 
manipulated staffing in a deliberate effort to inflate or deflate the numbers 
and achieve its policy goals. Thus, Bustamante suggests, when INS officials 
sought passage of immigration reform laws, they conducted an all-out effort to 
bolster arrests leading up to 1986, when the new statute was finally passed. 
Once the law was approved, Bustamante said, border enforcement was apparently 
relaxed, showing a drop-off in arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a manipulation from the top," Bustamante said. "The agency has been 
lying to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials defend the integrity of the figures. Although they acknowledge 
that border enforcement was increased before 1986, contributing to a steep rise 
in arrests, authorities say that the number of border enforcement man hours 
continued to increase during 1987, when arrests dropped dramatically. "I think 
they (the numbers) are the best barometer there is" of illegal immigration, 
said Austin, the agency spokesman. "It has its weaknesses, but I don't think 
there's a better number." 
</P>
<P>
Some independent analysts say the numbers are of some use, although corrections 
must be factored in for swings in INS border staffing, repeat arrests, seasonal 
shifts in migration (spring and summer are the most popular months), and a host 
of other factors. The figures correlate to certain events, such as the collapse 
of the Mexican economy in 1982, which triggered a huge emigration, noted Frank 
D. Bean, a demographer with The Urban Institute, a Washington-based policy 
research organization. Arrests began a sharp climb after 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two points of view," noted Bean, who has done extensive research 
into the figures as part of the institute's continuing examination of the 
effects of the 1986 immigration reform law. "On the one hand are INS personnel 
who have oversold the (numbers') value, saying they are an almost perfect 
indicator of flows across the border. Another point of view says that these 
things are worthless, that they don't tell you anything. . . . I think the 
truth is somewhere in between, that (the numbers') do tell us something of some 
use." 
</P>
<P>
Just how the 1986 immigration statute contributed to the lower apprehension 
numbers that followed its passage remains a matter of fierce debate. It is a 
debate that goes to the heart of any effort to gauge the effectiveness of the 
1986 law, which was largely intended to stem illegal immigration from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Judging the effectiveness of the 1986 immigration law in deterring undocumented 
border-crossers can be a daunting task. By definition, illegal immigration is a 
difficult phenomenon to measure. Fearing detection and possible deportation, 
undocumented foreigners typically avoid contact with local and federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The varying estimates surrounding the number of illegal immigrants residing in 
the United States reflect the confusion. The INS now says that there are 
perhaps 3 million undocumented foreigners, but officials acknowledge that the 
number is guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
Most undocumented people are Mexican citizens arriving overland through the 
almost-2,000 mile-long border; a large number of Central Americans and others 
also use the border to enter the United States clandestinely. 
</P>
<P>
The apprehension numbers are by nature inflationary. The statistics measure 
only arrests, so anyone arrested multiple times, as frequently happens along 
the border, is counted on each occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the volume of arrests along the border is astounding. That is 
particularly so in the San Diego area, the single busiest crossing point along 
the border, which provides a direct corridor to the immigrant job centers of 
Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
Take a recent, typical day: Last Sunday, Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents in San Diego recorded arrests of 1,219 illegal 
immigrants, or more than 50 per hour. Of those, 1,117, or 91%, were Mexican 
nationals; most signed forms admitting they were here illegally and were 
returned to Tijuana, usually within a day. Among the remaining 102 apprehended 
were 41 Guatemalans, 36 El Salvadorans, 11 Nicaraguans, 4 Hondurans, 2 
Egyptians, 2 Colombians, 2 Chinese and 1 citizen each from Bolivia, Belize, 
India and the Dominican Republic. Non-Mexicans apprehended may enter a range of 
legal proceedings, including the deportation process. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the large numbers of arrests, U.S. officials acknowledge that they 
apprehend only a fraction of those attempting to cross. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to track the law's impacts, INS officials, particularly 
ex-commissioner Nelson, turned once again to to border apprehension statistics, 
that familiar benchmark. However, many have challenged the INS's efforts to 
link the post-1986 declines in border arrests to the new sanctions against 
employers who hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
There is widespread agreement, however, that the 1986 law has likely affected 
the statistics in a variety of ways, some of them still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
In one major development, the newly legalized status for 3 million amnesty 
recipients -- almost 75% of them Mexican citizens and more than half residents 
of California -- has meant that many fewer people have to cross the border 
illegally; those 3 million people can now go back and forth freely. Not 
surprisingly, then, the number of legal crossings via ports of entry between 
California and Mexico have risen considerably since 1986, paralleling the 
decline in border arrests of illegal border-crossers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some Border Patrol resources have been shifted since passage of 
the law to assist in enforcing the new penalties against employers who hire 
undocumented workers. And, in San Diego, a hiring freeze has left U.S. Border 
Patrol staffing at a four-year low. Many agents, faced with hundreds of 
border-crossers every evening, are openly skeptical of INS claims that the 1986 
law is deterring illegal entry. 
</P>
<P>
"They (superiors) have to prove that the law they wanted is doing the job," 
said Steven Garcia, an agent with 10 years of experience in San Diego who is 
president of Local 1613 of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents' 
union. "Four or five years ago, we never had a hundred or more people running 
across the border together. . . . If we had more agents, we'd definitely have 
more arrests." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the true meaning the arrest figures, INS officials continue to cite 
them in an effort to evaluate trends at the border. They have done so for more 
than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers have been in use since the Border Patrol, a uniformed arm of the 
INS, was founded in in 1924 with 459 "former mounted guards, policemen, 
sheriffs, gunslingers of various types" and others, according to 1974 INS 
in-house history of the patrol. In 1925, agents arrested some 22,000 persons 
for immigration-law violations. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, authorities have used the numbers as evidence of waves of illegal 
immigration from Mexico. After World War II, apprehensions of the undocumented 
began to double and triple annually, peaking at more than 1 million arrests in 
fiscal 1954. Then, as now, illegal immigrants were blamed for a range of 
problems in U.S. border areas and immigrant communities. "The invasion by 
hordes of illegal aliens continued and with them came tremendously increased 
rates of crime in areas where they congregated," said the INS history. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities took action, instituting the infamous "Operation Wetback," 
arresting thousands of undocumented people and sending them back to Mexico. 
Caught in the web were many legal U.S. residents -- and even U.S. citizens -- 
residing in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Some fled out of fear. Researchers have 
found widespread abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"After the backbone of the wetback invasion was broken in California, task 
force operations were shifted to South Texas," the INS article noted. 
</P>
<P>
The ferocity of that operation has not been forgotten in Mexico, where the 1986 
immigration law revisions sparked fears of similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after "Operation Wetback," the border arrest numbers gradually 
declined, reaching a low of about 29,000 apprehensions in 1960. An sharp upward 
trend began in the 1980s, as the Mexican economy worsened, and reached its apex 
in 1986, when authorities recorded 1.6 million arrests of illegal immigrants 
along the U.S.-Mexico border, a new record. Again, as in the mid-1950s, there 
were calls for drastic steps to stem the "invasion." Those cries culminated in 
congressional passage in October 1986 of the immigration reform package.

FLOOD-CONTROL CHANNEL TAMED AN UNRULY RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego River has always been a temperamental neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction of the existing flood-control channel that empties into the 
Pacific Ocean near Mission Bay, the San Diego River generally ran wherever it 
wanted during the rainy months. Until a flood-control channel was created in 
the late 1800s, the river often ran through to San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Planning experts now agree that it is unwise to allow heavy development in 
flood basins. But the first massive wave of commercial, residential and 
industrial developments had sealed the fate of Mission Valley by the early 
1960s. The valley will grow even more congested during the next 20 years as 
land is freed from the threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go back to where it was" 30 years ago, said San Diego City Architect 
Mike Stepner. "It would have become a heavily traveled (area) with or without 
Mission Valley development." 
</P>
<P>
The development allowed in the past amounted to "piecemeal destruction" of the 
river's natural habitat, according to Jack Fancher, a biologist with the U.S. 
Fish &amp; Wildlife Service's Laguna Niguel field office. With additional 
development of the flood plain already approved, there are "very few options" 
left which will retain the valley's remaining native habitat, according to Bill 
Tippets, a state parks resource ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
Given other options -- a concrete riverbed or a grass-lined ditch -- the First 
San Diego River Improvement Project, with its natural habitat presented a 
"fascinating" alternative, Stepner said. "We managed to turn it around" and 
make the river "something that all San Diegans can make use of," Stepner said. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists and naturalists will continue to debate whether the restoration 
project is a success. And experts will continue to debate the wisdom of 
allowing more development in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Pryde, a San Diego State University geography professor, is satisfied 
with what FSDRIP looks like. But, from "a geography standpoint, I don't like 
it, because it's not adequate," Pryde said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, its capacity will be exceeded," Pryde said. "It's like saying 
sooner or later there will be an 8-point earthquake on the San Andreas Fault." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Chang, an SDSU engineering professor who designed the channel, 
acknowledged that, in time, the FSDRIP channel will overflow. But designing a 
flood-control channel for a 200-year flood is "not justified because the useful 
life span of a building is 100 years," Chang said. "If it does flood, only the 
first floor of the buildings will be flooded, and I don't mind changing the 
carpets every 100 or 200 years." GREG JOHNSON

<P>
In a bustling corner of the FBI headquarters, Special Agent Jack Quill is 
poring over an X-ray that bears an odd-looking pattern not unlike the bar code 
on a box of cereal. 
</P>
<P>
But these horizontal lines have nothing to do with supermarkets. What Quill is 
holding on the oblong transparency is a piece of evidence that most likely will 
put a rape suspect behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of the 400 in which the FBI's DNA Analysis Unit has completed 
its work since its opening last December. Work on 600 others, referred from law 
enforcement agencies throughout the country, is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us probably two to three weeks before we can even start a case now, 
because of our backlog," said John W. Hicks, the FBI assistant director who 
runs the bureau's sprawling laboratory division. "And it will probably get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the reasons that Hicks and other DNA experts, both in government 
and out, are applauding decisions by officials in Orange County and other 
jurisdictions to build their own laboratories to track down violent criminals 
through DNA "fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very powerful technology that's going to have a tremendous 
impact on law enforcement," especially in identifying rapists and, to a lesser 
extent, murderers, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
DNA testing technology represents a major breakthrough for law enforcement 
because it is a highly reliable method of positively matching blood, semen, 
hair or tissue samples taken from a crime scene with a blood sample taken from 
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The older technology of blood serology is effective in excluding suspects, but 
it hardly ever produces a positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is an organic material found in the 
chromosomes of every human being. It carries the basic genetic code that 
determines individual characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
By matching the repeating chemical patterns in those sections of DNA that bind 
genes together, scientists can routinely make identifications with certainties 
of one in several billion. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, law enforcement officials hope to build a computerized central DNA 
"fingerprint" identification system that will allow authorities to determine 
whether a series of rapes or murders across the country was the work of a 
single person, or whether a suspect arrested in one state was connected to 
violent crimes in another. 
</P>
<P>
Despite questions raised by defense attorneys and civil libertarians, the 
technology has been accepted in trial courts in 34 states, according to an 
official of one of the two major private DNA testing laboratories in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate courts in three of those states -- Maryland, Virginia and Florida -- 
have upheld the use of DNA testing, said John W. Huss, vice president of 
Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., about 25 miles northwest of 
Washington. No appellate court has yet rejected the technology. 
</P>
<P>
However, only two states and one local jurisdiction -- Virginia, North Carolina 
and Nassau County, N.Y. -- have opened DNA testing units in their own crime 
laboratories, according to the FBI. Six other state and local agencies, 
including the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department, are on their way. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Oct. 17 to spend $200,000 to 
create a DNA unit in the county crime laboratory, $80,000 of which will be from 
private sources that have contributed to the Sheriff's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was prompted in part by the disclosure that a suspect in the 
recent rape of a 12-year-old girl in Huntington Beach had been acquitted of a 
rape charge five months earlier because prosecutors were late in obtaining DNA 
evidence from a private laboratory. Had the evidence been received sooner, 
authorities have said, the man would probably have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we get it on-line, we feel, the better off we're going to be," said 
Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
"We feel that evidence of this type is so overwhelming that in a lot of cases, 
rather than go to trial, we'll get more guilty pleas." And that, Olson said, 
would save both time and money. 
</P>
<P>
Further, in the cases that go to trial, police officials said, an in-house DNA 
lab would eliminate the need to hire expert witnesses from private 
laboratories, which charge fees of as much as $1,000 for a single court 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Exonerations can result in savings too, police said. If a DNA test determines 
early on that a prime suspect could not possibly have been the assailant, 
police are not wasting time or money going after the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to determine the cost-effectiveness of establishing a 
DNA unit in a public crime lab, Huss said. The FBI performs its analyses for 
local police agencies at no cost, but the growing demand may mean longer waits 
for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say a laboratory that is going to do 10 cases a year, it would be 
absurd," Huss aid. "But maybe it makes sense if you're going to do 30 to 50 
cases a year. . . . It's very hard to calculate break-even, in a non-revenue 
environment and a non-competitive environment. But I think there are practical 
reasons to do it, chiefly chain of custody." 
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed in the early 1980s, and it has been refined in 
recent years. Its first widespread commercial application was in paternity 
testing. Huss estimated that 85% of his company's business involves paternity 
cases, but its criminal work is significant. 
</P>
<P>
Cellmark, for example, performed the lab work that led to the conviction last 
month of a 35-year-old woman for the robbery and murder of a worker at a 
Ventura hamburger stand. It was the first California case in which genetic 
testing evidence was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't view the entry of the public sector laboratories as a surprise or a 
problem," Huss said. "When the FBI entered this business, our business shot up 
substantially because it gave the broadest possible endorsement to the 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to operating its own DNA lab, the FBI also trains law enforcement 
agents from all over the country in the use of the technology. The bureau 
expects that 120 people will take its DNA courses at Quantico, Va., next year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite its promise, DNA identification does have limitations.

APPALLING SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days before Halloween, I went to the Museum of Man's annual haunted house 
and was distraught with my findings. Upon entering the museum, the first thing 
visitors see is a sign directing them to "Leningrad" and pointing them to the 
next room. Meanwhile, on the ground, are people crying for help, acting as 
victims of hunger and disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the next room, supposedly "Leningrad," are doctors performing what appears 
to be freak medical experiments on their patients. The patients are screaming 
while their bones are revealed as stripped of flesh and covered with blood. The 
initial impression given is that Leningrad is a place where people are dying 
from disease, hunger, and abusive experiments, reminding learned students of 
similar experiments from Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This scene is appalling. It is representative of the type of propaganda that 
should not be present in American society. What ideas does this plant in the 
minds of our children about the Soviet Union? Exaggerated and dramatized 
perceptions of foreign society, such as this, obstruct the movement for good 
public relations with fellow world powers. Does this not damage the peaceable 
effects of the Soviet arts festival? 
</P>
<P>
In a haunted house, designed for young children, displays of this nature should 
be left out. They definitely do not belong in a museum, a place where art and 
history are preserved for knowledge and growth.

CORONADO GANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to an article titled "Coronado Question: Does It Have 
a Gang Problem?" (Oct. 19) I find the so-called Coronado White Boys a revolting 
and ill-humored joke. Any form of respect (or humor, for that matter) cannot be 
dug up for these kids who make a feeble attempt at imitating those serious 
gangs on the mainland. Just calling themselves a "gang" already has invited a 
lot of dispute. Inevitably, so will it invite the serious gangs of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Such easy prey as a group of Coronado White Boys would be a pleasure for those 
gangs that dispute violently over colors and territory. Besides, any gang could 
just hop in a car with two or more members, and drive over the bay for free. 
The Coronado Bay Bridge begins in the Barrio Logan area of San Diego, a prime 
hangout for local gangs. It would only be a five- to 10-minute commute over to 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that these white boys be exposed to what gangs really are all about. 
I suggest that they be taken away from their secure and untouched homes in 
Coronado and placed in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood. I'd like to 
see their shocked faces as an innocent 10-year-old boy gets hit by gang 
cross-fire at a public park. I'd like them to attend a high school where they 
couldn't wear a certain color for fear of being terrorized by a gang. Would 
these teens still mock and imitate a gang with humorous intent after seeing the 
corruption and evil of a typical San Diego gang? Would they still have the 
nerve to form a gang in their community after seeing the fear gangs create in 
communities? 
</P>
<P>
And the answer to the Coronado question? Yes, Coronado has a gang problem. If 
these teens succeeded in forming a gang, with innocent intentions or not, then 
Coronado should be shuddering with fear of the possibility that it too can be 
infected with the widespread disease of gangs.

REFLECTIONS: 'IT'S NOT A LOT, BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO KEEP THE MEMORY GOING. . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

Before, whenever Toni Palafox baked cookies for her family -- which wasn't 
often -- she'd burn most of them. Betty Crocker she wasn't. But now the 
33-year-old Lakeside resident not only bakes 60 dozen cookies a day, she gets 
up at 4:30 a.m. to do it. Palafox is the owner of The Big Chipper, a tiny shop 
between 4th and 5th avenues on Broadway in downtown San Diego. The shop was a 
surprise gift from her husband, Fausto, who thought Palafox needed a 
distraction after the death of their young son two years ago. In memory of her 
son, and as a thank-you to San Diego Hospice, which helped care for him, she 
donates part of the sales to the hospice. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke 
interviewed Palafox at her store, and Barbara Martin Pinhero photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the baby died, I had a lot of time on my hands. My husband figured I was 
bored, so he went out and bought the shop for me. He didn't realize how content 
I was. 
</P>
<P>
I was a lousy cook at home. Out of three batches of cookies, I'd burn half of 
them. But now I'm really getting into it. I like the mixing. 
</P>
<P>
When Eric died, he was 20 months old. He was diagnosed at 15 months old with a 
brain tumor. We were up at Disneyland; he was this little toddler running 
around, and all of a sudden he stopped running. When he smiled, one side of his 
face wouldn't smile. 
</P>
<P>
We took him to his pediatrician who said, "Oh, he's got an ear infection." 
Finally, we took him to Children's Hospital, where the doctors said: "We're 
putting him in. There's definitely something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
I remember the first week, people would ask if me and my husband had eaten, and 
it would dawn on us, "Oh yeah, we do need to do those things." But we have two 
other kids, which made us get out and do the normal day-to-day routines. One of 
the first things I decided was that we had to keep our lives as normal as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
We could have put ourselves in the hospital and stayed there 24 hours a day . . 
. but after the surgeries, and after the doctors said they did everything they 
could, we said, "Fine, we're taking over now." That's when we contacted the San 
Diego Hospice. 
</P>
<P>
Our nurse, Liz, was a big help. She would play with the other kids, and do 
things for me so I could get away for a while. At one point, when Eric got 
really sick, and I had to take him in, I called Liz and told her to meet me at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors weren't really telling me anything, and I said there was no way 
Eric was going to die in the hospital. If he was that bad, then I'd take him 
back home. Liz told me to go in the other room, and she talked to the doctors. 
When she came back out, she said, "I had to get nasty with them." And Eric came 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
I think with Eric's illness I've learned that, whatever you put your mind to, 
you can accomplish. I never dreamed of owning my own business. It's very risky, 
especially when you jump in with no background. But now I feel like I can go 
out and do almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
I've built up a real rapport with the customers. We get a lot of business 
people; a lot of law firms that we do send out orders for all their meetings. 
Sometimes I come in here just to try to do some paper work, and, before I know 
it, I'm caught up in the front shop. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has to buy a cookie. It's not like something you have to go and do. So 
everybody who comes in the door is in a good mood. By the time they leave after 
eating a cookie, they're in a better mood. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate moose cookie is named after Eric because, during the summertime, 
he would go outside and get so dark, he'd be this little brown ball. The whole 
family called him a little chocolate moose. We donate a portion of the proceeds 
from this cookie to the hospice. It's not a lot, but it's enough to keep the 
memory going and to help anybody else who can't afford hospice services.

A four-vehicle collision on Interstate 15 south of Carroll Canyon Road Friday 
night killed a 24-year-old man and injured three others, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Michael Matthews, of Richmond, Ill., died early Saturday at Sharp 
Memorial Hospital after suffering multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Matthews and John Lentz, passengers in Matthews' car, were taken to 
UCSD Medical Center. Matthews was treated and released Saturday evening. Lentz 
was listed in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman said Harvey Woodfield, the driver of another car, was 
treated and released at Pomerado Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:42 p.m. when Woodfield stopped his vehicle while 
headed north on I-15 after observing an accident ahead of him. His vehicle was 
struck by two others and spun into the center divider, where he was hit by a 
fourth vehicle, CHP said.

MODEST PROJECTS, NOT GRAND SCHEMES, HELP TO REVITALIZE SMALL TEXAS TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
RURAL ECONOMY: THE FISHER COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION MADE ONE KEY 
DECISION: GO FOR ALL THE LITTLE PROJECTS, NOT ONE BIG PROJECT. THE RESULT HAS 
BECOME A CREATIVE MODEL FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

ROBY, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worn by long hours and weary of watching the town shrink, Bill Brzezinski threw 
in the towel on his Silver Spur Cafe 18 months ago, selling off the only 
restaurant in this dusty west Texas hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
Like the hardware store, the gas station, the grocery and so many others in so 
many towns in so many parts of rural America, the Silver Spur soon failed, and 
Brzezinski figured Roby wasn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
But today, an unusual economic development plan has begun to breathe new life 
into this one-stoplight town. A new retirement center has opened, and because 
of aggressive promotion, coveys of quail hunters now flock to Fisher County. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Silver Spur is going to shine again. Brzezinski is renovating the cafe 
and bringing it back from the dead this fall, convinced that the hungry hunters 
who come from 26 states for the four-month season will help the town of 814, 
and its only restaurant, survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude has changed," he said. "This is what has inspired me to do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening in Fisher County is held up across remote areas as an 
innovative approach to saving dying towns. But even here, after a handful of 
small successes, the future remains mostly bleak, and experts say the situation 
underscores just how difficult it is to revitalize rural America. 
</P>
<P>
"We have slowed the departure rate but, honestly, we haven't stopped it or 
reversed it," said David Morris, chairman of the county's economic development 
commission. "All this is for naught unless we find the key to repopulating 
rural America." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Fisher County's leaders declared a crisis: If they didn't do 
something, the county would die. Typical of small rural towns across the 
country, the population had already declined 44% over 10 years to just 5,000. 
Storefronts were boarded up. People, especially the young, moved to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of desperate -- no doubt about it," said Richard Spencer, the 
county agriculture extension agent who brought together the local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
They rounded up state and national experts on economic development and sought 
their advice. 
</P>
<P>
They created the Fisher County Economic Development Commission, and they made 
one key decision: Go for all the little projects they could think of, not one 
big project. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks that General Motors is going to come drop a factory in here or 
the B-2 program will drop in here. That doesn't happen, and that's the common 
mistake rural people make," said Morris, a specialist on developing Third World 
nations who retired to run a motel here. 
</P>
<P>
The result has become a creative, if unconventional, model for rural economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"They have less money and resources to work with, and yet after 10 years of 
decline, now they've got new money coming in," said David Guarino of the Texas 
Department of Agriculture, which has provided a grant for the quail-hunting 
effort. "If they can do it, you can do it all over." 
</P>
<P>
The commission has set out to revive this depressed cattle, cotton and oil area 
by promoting it as a retirement spot, drawing tourists and finding ways to keep 
citizens from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Two commission members bought an abandoned nursing home and helped find new 
owners who have refurbished it. It's now the county's only retirement center -- 
even though 60% of the population is over age 55. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing Fisher County had Texas' largest quail population, the commission 
formed a quail-hunting cooperative, which in its first year brought in 140 
hunters and an estimated $100,000 of new spending. 
</P>
<P>
"One hundred thousand dollars is an attention-getter in this town," said Billy 
Don Atkinson, a Roby-based federal agriculture official who helps run the 
co-op. 
</P>
<P>
And in Fisher County, they will try anything. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is hoping to build a memorial garden for slain police officers 
and turn an abandoned electric train depot into a museum to draw tourists. They 
are trying to raise money and serve the large poverty-level population with a 
food bank and used-clothing store. They have helped open a recreational vehicle 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The group even formed the National Domino Assn. and played host to a first-ever 
national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the ideas are working. 
</P>
<P>
The domino idea, while fun, hasn't produced much money and will probably be cut 
back. The law enforcement monument has drawn a 15-acre land donation, but has 
only $400 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is short; doom is just around the corner," said the Rev. Alvin Petty, the 
leader of the commission's tourism task force. "We've only got three or four 
more years to achieve a great deal because we're losing 8% of our population a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials say they now know that their small-scale endeavors are 
simply setting the stage for necessary larger development. "We have prepared 
the table, but we haven't gotten to the meat and potatoes," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
And help will have to come from Washington, he believes, in the form of a 
modern Homestead Act that would once again encourage people to return to rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we get that kind of public policy, the rest of this is Mickey Mouse. If 
they don't put that structure in place, all of rural America will be blowing in 
the wind."

EX-JUDGE ESCAPES FROM PRISON IN FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM KEYSER, THE BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Ottinger has vanished for the second time in three years. And again no one 
has a clue where he is. 
</P>
<P>
Once a respected lawyer and judge in Hagerstown, Md., Ottinger, 74, escaped 
Nov. 3 from the minimum-security federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base in 
Florida. He walked away from the prison, which has no walls, two hours before 
he was to be paroled from federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marshals Service, which is in charge of the search, is baffled. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger was in prison for stealing thousands of dollars from clients, lying on 
financial statements to banks, and forging checks and insurance papers. He was 
to be transported back to Hagerstown over the weekend, and then turned over to 
state prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
What makes his disappearance so perplexing is that he might have been paroled 
from state custody -- his last hurdle to freedom -- in the next month or two. 
And he knew it. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger now faces an extra five years in federal prison for escape. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Baltimore Evening Sun last Monday, he talked 
about what he might do as a free man. 
</P>
<P>
He also railed against a system that, in his mind, had kept him in jail too 
long and had not kept him informed about his transfer back to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"The real key to this is that nobody cares," he said. "I'm just another 
statistic lost in the backwoods of Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger had one compelling reason for disappearing: He did not want to serve 
time in state prison, even a short time. He once said that sentencing him to 
state prison would be tantamount to signing his death warrant; he feared that 
prisoners, especially those he had sentenced to life terms, would try to kill 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He was a Circuit Court judge in Washington County, Md., from 1971 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger vanished, for the first time, in January, 1987. For years he had been 
stealing money from the estates of Hagerstown residents, lying to banks about 
his assets and borrowing money illegally, and settling lawsuits without his 
clients' knowledge and then forging their names on the settlement checks. 
</P>
<P>
He methodically planned his disappearance. He rented an old farmhouse in 
Gettysburg, Pa., where he initially hid out for two weeks. The 5-foot-10-inch 
judge dyed his white hair brown and lost nearly 40 pounds, dropping from 295 to 
257. 
</P>
<P>
And he assumed another name. 
</P>
<P>
Three months after Ottinger fled Maryland, FBI agents arrested him in a small 
apartment in York, Pa., where he was studying for a real estate exam. 
</P>
<P>
He later pleaded guilty in federal court to mail fraud and defrauding a bank, 
and was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in federal prison. Then he pleaded guilty in 
state court to forgery and was sentenced to 8 1/2 years in state prison. The 
sentences were to run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
In state and federal courts he was ordered to pay a total of nearly $320,000 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger told the Evening Sun last year that he had fled after his life fell 
apart, that he had been drinking and gambling heavily, and that he had fallen 
hopelessly in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger was serving his federal sentence impeccably until two hours before his 
scheduled parole. Fellow prisoners last saw him at 6 a.m. Friday when they were 
called to breakfast. But at 8 a.m., when Ottinger was summoned to the 
administration building, he was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been driven by van to the Washington County jail in Hagerstown, 
where officials would have turned him over to the Maryland Department of 
Correction. 
</P>
<P>
Ottinger would have been admitted to the state's 
reception-diagnostic-classification center in Baltimore. According to Greg 
Shipley, spokesman for the Department of Correction, Ottinger might have 
remained at the center until his parole hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Davis, chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, said last week that 
a hearing for Ottinger would have been scheduled in December or January. Davis 
would not speculate on Ottinger's chances of being paroled.

DANGEROUS CLAN'S CHILDREN ON THE RUN

<P>
The disappearance of six children of dead polygamist leader Ervil LeBaron dims 
hopes of breaking two decades of religious violence in which more than 20 
people were slain, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The six fled foster homes in Salt Lake City the last of September and may be 
headed to a family hide-out in Mexico, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad," said assistant U.S. Atty. Dave Schwendiman, who heads a "LeBaron 
Crime Family" task force. "You think maybe you have a chance to stop the 
violence and give these kids a chance for a normal life . . . and then it blows 
up on you." 
</P>
<P>
The children were identified as Norma LeBaron, 18; Nikki LeBaron, 17; Jessica 
LeBaron, 15; Jerod LeBaron, 14; Daniel LeBaron, 13, and Joshua LeBaron, 12. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe LeBaron's eldest surviving son and clan patriarch, Andrew, 
may have organized their escapes, Salt Lake County Attorney's Investigator Lt. 
Dick Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, 29, and brothers Aaron, 22, and Heber, 25, are believed to have led the 
clan in a recent series of killings that followed the practice of blood 
atonement preached by their father, authorities said. Heber and Aaron are in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives believe the three brothers are executing a hit list written by their 
father, who founded the violent Church of the Lamb of God and was convicted of 
ordering the 1977 slaying of a rival Utah polygamist. 
</P>
<P>
LeBaron, who had a dozen wives and fathered more than 50 children, died of a 
heart attack in 1981 at age 56 in the Utah State Prison. Authorities and 
relatives describe his "Book of New Covenants," written in prison, as a 
blueprint for revenge against those LeBaron believed abandoned him after his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The clan is a radical offshoot of the Mormon Church, which now bans polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
The six children were placed in foster homes after being subpoenaed along with 
other family members by the U.S. attorney's office in Salt Lake City for a 
grand jury investigation into the Oct. 16, 1987, killing of Daniel Ben Jordan, 
a Colorado polygamist and former LeBaron lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the children refused to cooperate with the investigation out 
of fear of retribution from other family members. 
</P>
<P>
The clan has been dealt a series of blows in the last two years with the 
arrests of more than a dozen members. 
</P>
<P>
Heber LeBaron and four others are in prison in Arizona, convicted of operating 
a truck theft ring to finance the family. Heber also is wanted in Houston for 
attempting to kill a guard in a credit union holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron LeBaron and two other members are being held in Chicago on federal 
charges of possessing false identification papers. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew may have sought to gather remaining family members and regroup in 
Mexico, said Forbes, who has tracked the clan for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The three brothers remain suspects in the killings of three former LeBaron 
followers and the daughter of one of the victims in Houston and the Dallas 
suburb of Irving on June 27, 1988. They also are suspects in the disappearance 
of former LeBaron apostle Leo P. Evoniuk near Santa Cruz, Calif., in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Other members are in hiding, believing they are on the hit list, Forbes said. 
They include Rena Chynoweth, a former wife of Evril LeBaron, and her mother, 
Thelma, who were trying to adopt the six youngsters when they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Rena's brothers, Mark and Duane Chynoweth, were killed in Houston, along with 
Duane's 8-year-old daughter, Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed my brothers and my sister and my niece," said Glenn Chynoweth, 
Rena's brother, who lives in Sunset. "I wanted to break that chain so we don't 
have some up and coming young ones to be trained in violence."

FOR TRENDIES, A FORECAST LONG ON FADS

"Smart toilets" and car radar will usher in the high-tech advances coming in 
the 1990s, while bad service, loud rock music and Mexican beer will become 
passe, says "The American Forecaster 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Other trends on the rise for 1990 are New Age radio, portraits commissioned for 
ego gratification and "wet" beer to serve on the rocks, says Kim Long, author 
of the yearly book. 
</P>
<P>
White will be the fashionable color in clothing for women, who will favor 
shorter hair, he says. Men will grow their hair longer and wear wider ties, the 
Forecaster predicts. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1990s we will see phenomenal advances. A popular phrase some futurists 
are using is that life has the potential to move forward very rapidly because 
80% of all the scientists and engineers who have ever lived are alive today," 
said Long. 
</P>
<P>
"The corollary to that is that 80% of all the artists, crackpots and loonies 
who have ever lived are alive today. We will see some intriguing things happen 
in the 1990s," he said, including a wave of bizarre prognostications as the 
year 2000 approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Long, 40, is a Denver free-lance author who began writing the Forecaster in 
1983 and claims an 80% accuracy rate. He wrongly predicted a Michael S. Dukakis 
presidency and the demise of television's "Dallas" and "Dynasty," but he 
estimated half his material reflects inevitable consumer trends. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a few years ago, he forecast that Cabbage Patch doll sales would 
drop by half. "They dropped off by more than half. It wasn't guesswork. The 
information came from the toy industry, which says that all fad toys that sell 
that well that quickly are temporary phenomena." 
</P>
<P>
"Smart toilets" are made by a Japanese company to measure recent hospital 
outpatients' blood pressure, pulse, urine, temperature and body weight. Results 
are displayed on a built-in monitor. Long predicts that gadget lovers will pay 
the $3,000 to have a conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
Long said car radar systems will gauge other vehicles' speeds and may 
incorporate automatic braking. Some experts believe if all vehicles had the 
devices, highways could be safely packed with vehicles moving at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
New Age radio took off so quickly it's a major trend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a permanent form of programming," he said. "It's been called 
musical wallpaper, at its most disparaging. It's somewhere between jazz and 
soft rock, and it has the potential to not offend a fairly wide proportion of 
the population." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, affluent executives are commissioning sculptures and portraits of 
themselves and their families, a trend Long calls "ego-art." 
</P>
<P>
A low-budget version, the video booth, is cropping up in shopping centers and 
shouldering aside the booths where people used to have wallet-size snapshots 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
"They shoot a 5- or 10-minute videotape," said Long. "You can speak, sing, or 
quote poetry. It's the concept of immortalizing yourself." 
</P>
<P>
A major trend that will carry through the 1990s is a campaign by retailers to 
stamp out bad service. 
</P>
<P>
"Surveys, polls and extensive studies have shown that this is the top 
priority," Long said. "We have become line-sensitive. Queuing up is a foreign 
disease that we don't want to catch." 
</P>
<P>
Ear plugs are being offered to customers at pop music clubs and rock concerts 
because of concern about hearing loss, according to "The American Forecaster." 
He notes that at the same time, over-amped car sound systems are booming. 
</P>
<P>
Among drinkers, the Mexican beer fad will be on the way out, he predicted. 
Liquor with lower alcohol levels and "wet" beer, a brew served on the rocks, 
will debut in 1990, while low-alcohol beer will continue to founder, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Long's book, which sells fewer than 10,000 copies despite all the interest it 
stirs up, may be in for some high-tech changes itself. In the works is a 
possible video version with computer animation, and Long is exploring use of a 
computer database and facsimile machine to dispense his prognostications.

YACHT BRITANNIA STILL RULES THE WAVES

ABOARD HMS BRITANNIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"And over here, gentlemen, is the Queen's personal study," said the young naval 
officer, resplendent in starched white uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Curious Malaysian businessmen in expensive suits peered obediently at Queen 
Elizabeth's simple but elegant cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1968 Britain has been giving a few of the world's businessmen the royal 
treatment on board the Queen's floating palace to drum up investment. 
</P>
<P>
Selected groups are invited to spend a day on the HMS Britannia, attending 
seminars and conducted tours of the yacht -- and, according to the official 
royal yacht brochure, the red carpet welcome seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
Only 13 such tours have been conducted in 20 years but they have "generated 
hundreds of millions of pounds of business," the brochure says. 
</P>
<P>
The latest guests were about 50 chief executives of Malaysian banks and 
corporations who trailed around the labyrinth of gangways and narrow stairways 
aboard the 410-foot yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Ducking under railings through the laundry room, where temperatures soar to 120 
degrees, the red-faced executives were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a charming way to do business. They have us all on board with no 
telephones and secretaries to distract us," a bank chairman said as the 
Britannia sailed majestically off the western Malaysian port of Klang. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here because we want to see how the royal family lives," he said, 
after lunching in the dining area where the Queen has her meals. On the menu 
were lemon chicken and lamb with mint sauce, washed down with wine from the 
Buckingham Palace cellars. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm afraid you can't visit her majesty's cabin," said Cmdr. David 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The Britannia has the status of a royal palace and security is as one would 
expect of Buckingham Palace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a suite of cabins abaft (at the rear, above the main deck) which 
serves as the royal apartments but we can't show them for security reasons," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 260 officers and men work aboard the Britannia, many of whom have 
also served on warships such as the guided missile destroyer Nottingham, which 
escorts the royal yacht. 
</P>
<P>
"It is different and very enjoyable but work is no lighter than being on a 
warship," Lancaster said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, as on an operational exercise, we have to make everything absolutely 
perfect," he said. "There is no margin for error in performance." 
</P>
<P>
Named and launched by the Queen in 1953, the year of her coronation, the 
5,769-ton, 12,000-horsepower ship has sailed hundreds of thousands of miles. It 
carried the royal family around the world in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Britannia replaced the Victoria and Albert as the yacht that serves as the 
monarch's residence overseas or in home waters, a tradition dating back to 
1660, when King Charles II was presented with a yacht by the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
The luxurious yacht is also listed as a hospital ship and was ordered into 
service by the Queen to perform that function during the 1982 Falklands War in 
the south Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
It has undergone several refittings, said Lancaster. "But as ships go, it is an 
old vessel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The royal yacht does indeed have an old world charm, with varnished railings 
and polished brasswork. 
</P>
<P>
Black-and-white and color photographs of British royalty dating back to the 
turn of the century adorn the white walls, along with such items as a whale 
bone picked up by the Duke of Edinburgh on Deception Island in 1957, sharks' 
teeth swords from Kiribati, kris from Malaysia and golden daggers from the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Long after the sun set on the British Empire, Britannia still rules the waves 
-- doing a splendid public relations job.

KURDISH REBELS PRESS FIGHT FOR IRAN HOMELAND

Grim-faced, the teen-age boys squatted around a Kurdish guerrilla showing them 
how to strip and assemble a machine gun. Soon, they would be using the weapon 
in a conflict that is almost 70 years old -- the Kurds' fight for an 
independent homeland in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-backed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran has in recent weeks stepped 
up its attacks on Iranian military bases and economic targets. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla chieftains at the KDP base camp here in the Iraqi mountains said the 
youngsters will go into action, as their fathers and grandfathers have before 
them, in the mountains of northwestern Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"They get three months' training in weapons, explosives and guerrilla tactics, 
then join units inside Iran to carry out hit-and-run attacks," said the camp 
commander, who would identify himself only as Salam. 
</P>
<P>
It is a war that has largely been overshadowed by Kurdish campaigns in 
neighboring Turkey and in Iraq itself. In southeastern Turkey, the outlawed 
Kurdish Labor Party has been fighting a guerrilla war for five years to 
establish a separate Marxist state. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 million Kurds -- Sunni Muslims of Aryan stock -- live in an 
overlapping area where the borders of Soviet Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria and 
Turkey converge, a region once known as Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, Iran and Turkey all have faced rebellions by their Kurdish minorities. 
But Iraq is nonetheless backing the Iranian Kurds in an extension of its 
decades-old rivalry with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Iran backed Iraqi Kurds in their war against the government in Baghdad during 
the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. Syria aids Kurdish fighters in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The KDP fighters, clearly with Iraqi consent, stepped up their attacks after 
their veteran leader, Abdul Rahman Qassemlou, was assassinated July 13 in 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
His successor, Sa'eed Badal, said Qassemlou went to Vienna in response to an 
offer from Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani to negotiate an end to the 
Kurdish rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Badal said he believes Qassemlou was killed by agents of radical Iranian 
factions in an attempt to torpedo Rafsanjani's efforts to end the mountain war, 
a move that would have strengthened his credibility as a pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
Badal said the KDP has turned down an Iranian proposal to resume negotiations 
because "we no longer trust them." 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas, known as Peshmergas, or "those who face death," say hundreds of 
young Iranian Kurds have joined them in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claim that they are 
pinning down some 200,000 Iranians. Diplomatic sources in Baghdad estimated 
that as many as 2,500 KDP guerrillas are in Iraq, with thousands more operating 
inside Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in my village said the Peshmergas are working for a better future 
for the Kurdish nation, so I decided to join them," said Farouk Hassan Pour, 
14, who trekked across the mountains for seven days until the guerrillas found 
him. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in this camp high in the 
northern Iraqi mountains overlooking the Iranian border. 
</P>
<P>
In the camp are about 1,000 guerrillas, dressed in their distinctive baggy 
trousers and turbans. Several thousand Kurdish women and children live in 
villages in the surrounding valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The KDP runs the camp, but the area is under Iraqi military control. The 
guerrillas are not allowed to leave without Iraqi permission. 
</P>
<P>
The Kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in the lush uplands. 
The Iraqis provide flour, rice and fuel oil. 
</P>
<P>
A rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp for guerrillas who have 
lost limbs. Among the 30 undergoing therapy is Ismail Muradi, 23, who lost an 
arm in a recent raid. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I have to live in this camp, deprived of the good things of 
life, for 50 years, so long as the next generation of Kurds can live as free 
human beings," said Muradi, who joined the guerrillas last year. 
</P>
<P>
A five-member French medical team from two relief agencies, Medecins Sans 
Frontieres and International Medical Aid, operates a makeshift hospital in the 
base. The team alternates with others who spend three-month tours in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are pretty primitive," said Jean Breveau, a surgeon from Paris who 
is on his third tour. "We've eliminated serious diseases, but there's a lot of 
malnutrition and back pains, which are common among mountain people." 
</P>
<P>
Breveau, who also has worked in Africa and with Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka off 
southern India, said he misses life in Paris and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"But these people need my help more than the people of Paris," he said. 
"There's a great satisfaction when you save someone who would have died if 
there had been no surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
The Kurds were promised an independent state in the Treaty of Sevres of 1920. 
But the great powers sliced up Kurdistan among Iran, Iraq and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Kurds have been in a constant state of revolt against one or 
more of these states. The Kurdish revolt in Persia, which later became known as 
Iran, began in 1920.

DIVER CLAIMS NOTED GREAT LAKES WRECKS

A salvage expert says he spent 16 years battling the stormy waters of Lake 
Michigan to uncover "the find of the century" -- two 19th-Century passenger 
steamers. But now he must fight the state to lay claim to the historic 
shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do is see this wreck preserved," Harry Zych said. He was 
referring to the Lady Elgin, a luxury steamer that sank with 287 passengers and 
their valuables when it was rammed by another vessel in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Zych filed a claim in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking title 
under federal admiralty law to the Lady Elgin and the Seabird, another sunken 
luxury boat he discovered. 
</P>
<P>
He already has removed some artifacts from the two wrecks and believes more 
should be brought to the surface for preservation. The recovered items are 
under claim of the court until ownership is decided. 
</P>
<P>
But Illinois officials claim that the wrecks are state property and should 
remain at the bottom, untouched except for authorized archeological work and 
recreational sightseeing by divers. 
</P>
<P>
"To go in and strip them of artifacts and sell them is just not palatable to 
the state and is not in the best interest of the state," said William Kane, an 
assistant state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said his office is seeking to intervene in the case on behalf of the 
Illinois Department of Transportation and the Illinois Historic Agency. He said 
a 1987 federal law gives states the rights to any shipwrecks found in their 
territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
The state also is citing an Illinois law that prohibits the desecration of 
unregistered graves. 
</P>
<P>
Zych, who won't disclose the exact location of the wrecks, said he doesn't 
believe there is anything of great monetary value aboard either ship. He 
declined to say what items he had brought up already. 
</P>
<P>
The sinking of the Lady Elgin on the night of Sept. 8, 1860, somewhere off 
Chicago's North Shore suburbs, still ranks as one of the worst disasters in 
Great Lakes shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden, side-wheeled steamer was rammed by the lumber schooner Augusta, 
which was running without lights. The Lady Elgin sank rapidly, taking the lives 
of 287 passengers, mostly members of a Milwaukee political group returning from 
an excursion to Chicago. A handful of passengers made it to shore in Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
In a lesser-known tragedy, the Seabird caught fire and sank April 9, 1868, 
killing all but one of the 100 passengers. Also a side-wheeled steamer, the 
Seabird was making its first run of the season to Chicago after wintering in 
Manitowoc, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Zych said he has found no human remains on either wreck and cited newspaper and 
other historical accounts that all the bodies were recovered soon after the 
sinkings. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Chicago native, who runs the American Diving and Salvage Co., 
said he first started looking for the Lady Elgin in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long-term love affair. Nobody really knew where it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also was looking on and off for the Seabird, and found it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Then in May he found the Lady Elgin using sonar. In 42-degree water, divers 
found a spoon engraved with the ship's name. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty exhilarating," he said. "It's the find of the century in the 
Great Lakes." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Zych nor his lawyer would say what they plan to do with items retrieved 
from the wrecks. Nor would they say whether Zych would accept compensation for 
the wrecks and turn them over to the state. According to court documents, Zych 
has spent $100,000 on the salvage operation. 
</P>
<P>
But Kane said that under the 1987 law, Zych is not entitled to any 
compensation.

REFORESTATION PLAN'S GOAL IS TO SAVE GUATEMALA TREES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the gringo arrived with his talk of putting trees and terraces in the 
fields, an intense debate began here. 
</P>
<P>
The peasants were suspicious. Why did he care whether they planted any trees? 
Was it so the Americans could come and cut them down when they grew large? 
</P>
<P>
Some, however, realized something had to be done. There was no place to go, no 
more forests to cut and burn and clear for crops. And every year the rains 
washed away more of the thin tropical topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people understood that we ourselves are part of the problem," said Hector 
Lopez, a farmer. "Others didn't. They blamed other things. Some said it was the 
government. One man told me the weather was changing because the Americans were 
going to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 31, looked down at his 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid of 6, 7, 8 years old there were more trees, more woods, more 
springs. It's not even 20 years, but it has changed so much." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of Guatemala's forests have disappeared in the past decade, said 
Kirsten Johnson, head of a CARE agriforestry project trying to reverse the 
trend. The project recently won a $2-million grant from Applied Energy 
Services, a U.S. company that is building coal-fired power plants in the United 
States and is looking for a way to help offset the pollution the plants would 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Guatemala's forests have fallen victim to logging, ranching and 
agribusiness interests, others to pressure of a growing population, of peasants 
desperate for a plot of land to feed their families, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in this hamlet of about 300 families reflects a new approach 
to the problem. Forests are not being replanted. There is no place for them 
now: The people need the land. 
</P>
<P>
The CARE project began in 1974 and now aims at changing lives, not landscapes, 
Johnson said. Massive reforestation projects of the 1970s and early 1980s 
failed because they did not take into account the causes of deforestation. 
"People have certain very clear needs for food, fuel and construction wood. 
They are not able to meet those needs." 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has one of the most unequal distributions of land in the hemisphere. 
About 4.5% of landholders own 70% of the land, and that 70% is the richest. For 
peasants, "there's no place to go except up the hillsides," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Many hillsides, once covered by trees, now are bare, stripped for firewood and 
fence posts and to make way for the beans and corn on which peasants live. 
</P>
<P>
The area around Guachipilin, 76 miles southeast of Guatemala City, was 
deforested by the early 1960s. Some peasants are now farming hillsides so steep 
they use ropes to hoist themselves up and down their plots. 
</P>
<P>
The program moved into Guachipilin three years ago. Its budget is $300,000 a 
year, largely for design, planning and follow-up. Other support, supplies and 
Peace Corps volunteers are funded by the U.S. Agency for International 
Development and the Guatemalan government.

RESTRUCTURING OF CANADIAN SENATE GETS LIFT IN ALBERTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WATSON, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OTTAWA, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadians got a look last month at their first-ever elected Senate nominee, an 
election some observers view as the nation's first cautious step toward 
restructuring the century-old upper chamber of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The election in Alberta of Stan Waters as the province's Senate nominee is, 
said Alberta-based political scientist David Elton, spurred by a feeling of 
alienation in western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta is a relatively small province that has little influence at the federal 
level. Its citizens are fed up, Elton said, with a parliamentary system that 
fails to mediate regional concerns and is dominated by the provinces of Quebec 
and Ontario to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta insisted on holding elections to express the widespread desire for 
Senate reform, Elton added. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Parliament is made up of 295 elected members in the House of Commons 
and 104 appointed members of the Senate. The number of seats in the Senate does 
not change, although there are frequent vacancies as members retire. Quebec and 
Ontario dominate both chambers because of their huge population base. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of an elected Senate believe that an equal number of 
representatives from each province would remedy the imbalance in the House of 
Commons, since western provinces or any other region could vote as a bloc in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of an elected Senate is supported by the majority of Canadians and 
elected politicians and most of the current senators. 
</P>
<P>
The general perception of Canada's Senate is one of aging political cronies who 
rubber-stamp government legislation without submitting it to any "sober second 
thought," as was originally envisioned when the country's parliamentary system 
was established. 
</P>
<P>
The senators serve until age 75, most of them reportedly doing little to earn 
their $60,000-a-year salary and free airline travel. 
</P>
<P>
No attendance records are kept, which allows senators to have full-time 
employment elsewhere. One senator, Ed Lawson, for years has served as head of 
the Teamsters Union in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The upper chamber is prevented by the Constitution from blocking money bills, 
but does have the power to amend or even kill other legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The sometime frivolous nature of the Senate was reflected this year in a leaked 
report, commissioned by the senators, that recommended that their 
mahogany-trimmed offices be equipped with bathrooms, dressing rooms, closets 
and three-quarter-length mirrors. A private dining room was also a must, the 
report said, as well as a gymnasium with locker rooms, sauna, showers, exercise 
equipment and beds. 
</P>
<P>
While Senate reform is generally favored, there is disagreement on how the body 
should be structured and whether its powers should duplicate those of the House 
of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, a retired army commander and former chief of a major construction 
company, has made it clear he favors a "triple E" Senate: elected, equal and 
effective. Waters was backed in his bid for the nomination by the Reform Party, 
a fringe political party in western Canada that opposes bilingualism and wants 
a balanced federal budget by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it is unclear if Waters will even be allowed to take his seat in 
the upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the prime minister has traditionally had the right to choose members 
of the Senate. Under the terms of the so-called Meech Lake Accord negotiated 
two years ago by the provinces and the federal government, it was agreed the 
provinces could submit lists of nominees for Senate vacancies, leaving it to 
the prime minister to make the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney promised that if the accord was ratified, he 
would begin negotiations aimed at Senate reform. But at least two provinces 
have held back approval because the accord recognizes Quebec as a "distinct 
society" and principal home in Canada of French-speaking people. 
</P>
<P>
Elton believes the accord will eventually be approved but only if it contains a 
framework for Senate reform. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for ratification of the accord is next June.

ROCK CLIMBING NEW YORK INDOOR SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE GARTIES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The handful of rock climbers who insist on pursuing their obscure sport amid 
the skyscrapers of Manhattan have decided to do something about the acute 
shortage of cliffs: They've built an indoor climbing wall. 
</P>
<P>
Clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrills of scaling a 
300-foot cliff in Upstate New York or a soaring spire in the Rockies. But the 
fake wall that opened last month offers climbers a chance to practice most of 
the basic rock moves. 
</P>
<P>
And more important, it's close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," said Pierre Vaz, one of about 60 climbers who turned out for 
opening festivities. "This is a perfect time for it to open, because it's 
starting to get nippy outside." 
</P>
<P>
The wall, in a little-used city recreation center on West 59th Street not far 
from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, occupies one end of an old 
paddle-ball court. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets of three-quarter-inch plywood are bolted to the 20-foot-high wall in 
replicas of the shapes climbers seek in nature: an overhanging cliff face; a 
narrow chimney; knife-edged arete, or buttress; a two-foot roof jutting out 
horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
Bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plastic resin in a variety 
of shapes, from easily grasped "buckets" to pockets just big enough to grasp 
with one finger, to narrow, sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for 
fingertips or toes. 
</P>
<P>
Protected by safety ropes, climbers puzzle out routes to the top, or move 
delicately from one side of the wall to the other in that vertical ballet 
mountaineers call traversing. 
</P>
<P>
Installing the wall was more a political feat than a technical one. 
</P>
<P>
About 18 months ago, climbers who keep their skills sharp by working out on 
boulders in Central Park found the rangers seemed to be making a special effort 
to chase them away. Normally a disorganized lot, they formed a loose alliance 
called the City Climbers Club of New York to lobby park officials to call off 
the troops. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Ralph Erenzo says he was pleasantly surprised to find city officials 
receptive to the new club's overtures. 
</P>
<P>
They quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climbers would agree to 
avoid a few well-traveled spots. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the climbers mentioned they were worried about twisting their ankles 
on rocks sticking out of the ground at the base of their favorite 20-foot 
cliff, "Rat Rock," the city sent in a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a 
layer of shock-absorbing wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
"The club gave us credibility," said Erenzo, 38, who has a business designing 
and building exhibits for trade shows. "It showed them we weren't a bunch of 
yahoos." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Erenzo's contact in the park hierarchy was eager to 
encourage off-beat sports. William Castro, the Parks &amp; Recreation 
Department's assistant commissioner for recreation, already had helped organize 
Frisbee championships, skateboard contests and BMX bicycle exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
And Castro had dabbled with climbing in an Outward Bound-style 
confidence-building program the city offers for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a thrill from it that I don't think you get in many organized sports 
-- you're challenging yourself and seeing what you're made of," Castro said. 
"It's a real test of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
When Erenzo started talking about artificial walls, the city's biggest worry 
was the risk of someone's falling and filing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In several months of lobbying, Erenzo showed Castro that artificial climbing 
walls are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated in Europe, and are 
slowly coming to this country. The best known is at Snowbird, Utah, where a 
huge fiberglass scarp was the site of the International Sport Climbing 
Championships in August. 
</P>
<P>
Erenzo, who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge the Snowbird 
contest, worked to persuade city officials that his sport is safe if pursued 
responsibly. The climbers demonstrated how they hang a rope from the top of a 
practice cliff, so a partner can catch a climber who slips from the rock within 
a foot or two. 
</P>
<P>
After a slide show by leading French wall designer Jean Marc Blanche, Castro 
decided to give the idea a try, and offered the sky-lit paddle-ball court in 
the under-used recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone involved realizes the wall isn't accident-proof, but they've developed 
a system to lessen the legal risk.

YEAR-OLD FALLING-OUT HAUNTS 2 INGLEWOOD COUNCILMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year-old personal dispute between Anthony Scardenzan and Garland Hardeman has 
snowballed into a political battle between the two Inglewood City Council 
members that is showing no signs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan, a 60-year-old tool and die maker who is in his second term on the 
council, and Hardeman, a 33-year-old Los Angeles police officer in his first 
month as an elected official, were once friends and political allies. 
</P>
<P>
When Hardeman was still laying the groundwork for his political career, 
Scardenzan nominated him to the city's Construction Appeal Board. Later, when 
Hardeman set his sights on the City Council, Scardenzan donated $1,000 to his 
campaign. Scardenzan says he supported Hardeman because he considered him to be 
"an intelligent young man who could really do something for the community." 
</P>
<P>
But all that changed last year when Scardenzan and Hardeman found themselves 
debating opposite views at a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
They had been invited to the forum to discuss Scardenzan's proposal to create a 
special police tax to pay for 20 new officers. Scardenzan says he expected to 
show a videotape about the nation's drug problem and to discuss his proposal, 
but when he arrived he found himself facing a debate with Hardeman and 
questions from audience members who opposed the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Although he knew that Hardeman did not favor the tax, which city voters later 
passed by a substantial margin, Scardenzan still recalls the debate with anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with somebody wanting to debate me, but the fashion he did 
it really hurt me," Scardenzan said. "He embarrassed me in public and 
afterwards he laughed." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman downplays what happened that evening, denying that he attempted to 
humiliate Scardenzan. He says Scardenzan has taken personal affront over their 
difference of opinion on the police tax. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Denkins, a Hardeman ally who was at the forum that evening, says 
Scardenzan is overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
"Scardenzan is so rigid I don't see why he doesn't break in half," Denkins 
said. "When I was a kid, I remember tall palm trees that would bend right over 
in the wind and then snap back up. A different type of tree didn't have much 
flexibility and would break right off. That's Scardenzan." 
</P>
<P>
After the debate, Scardenzan dropped his support of Hardeman, who was 
challenging the 1987 election that had put Ervin (Tony) Thomas in office. 
Scardenzan endorsed Thomas in last month's court-ordered special election and 
vowed to resign if Hardeman won. He later changed his mind, saying supporters 
had encouraged him to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hardeman recently offered to discuss their falling-out, Scardenzan has 
refused to speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He had my friendship, and he threw it away," Scardenzan said last week. "I 
don't want to put my hand in the fire a second time when I know it will be 
burned." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers say they hope the dispute won't affect council decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Scardenzan-Hardeman feud is in the best interest of anyone 
to continue -- Scardenzan, Hardeman or the community," said Ken Gossett, an 
Inglewood businessman and Scardenzan ally. "It's a very immature way for both 
of them to act. There has to be some distancing of your own ego, your own 
political ambitions, from the job." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, at the first council meeting where both were present, Scardenzan 
angrily opposed a Hardeman proposal to push the meeting time back two hours and 
called for an investigation into a city-sponsored reception for Hardeman before 
his swearing-in ceremony Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman responded by taunting Scardenzan about his resignation threat. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's council meeting, Scardenzan called on Hardeman to repay the $650 
the city spent for invitations, two sheet cakes and coffee for the reception. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not right," Scardenzan said in an interview. "I think if Garland 
Hardeman wants to be honest with the taxpayers, he will pay back the money." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman did not respond to Scardenzan at the meeting, and he said in an 
interview later that he will no longer be drawn into personal squabbling. 
Hardeman said it was city staff members, not he, who suggested the refreshments 
at the reception, and he has no plans to reimburse the city. 
</P>
<P>
The two men are now in a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman says he has attempted conciliation but has failed. Scardenzan says he 
does not plan to talk with Hardeman, although he said he will not allow their 
dispute to interfere with city business. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jose Fernandez, elected in June, said he is attempting to arrange 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony and Garland will have to try to work together," Fernandez said. "On the 
council, you don't have to like your peers."

CHAOS REIGNS IN LAWNDALE AFTER VOTING; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: AFTER VOTERS REJECTED MEASURES DESIGNED TO RESOLVE QUESTIONS ON THE 
CITY'S GENERAL PLAN, THE ONLY THING TO EMERGE IN WAKE OF THE BALLOTING IS 
POINTED FINGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As a result of Tuesday's election outcome in Lawndale, city development has 
virtually come to a halt, and city officials and residents are asking what can 
be done and who is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
No one in City Hall has a quick solution to the dilemma that blossomed when 
voters overwhelmingly rejected three ballot measures intended to straighten out 
a controversy over the city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
But many in the city have been quick to point fingers, with blame being 
parceled out among the city attorney, the City Council and a group of activists 
who spoke out against the measures. 
</P>
<P>
In general terms, the voters rejected the city's 1976 General Plan and refused 
to repeal Ordinance 82, a 1963 law that requires the city to seek voter 
approval of the General Plan, which governs all zoning and development in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, City Atty. David J. Aleshire ordered a halt Wednesday to issuing 
building permits for fear of violating state law, which requires cities to have 
an up-to-date General Plan before it can allow building construction. 
</P>
<P>
The city has "ended up with the worst situation that could have occurred," said 
Aleshire, who authored the ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody is willing to take full blame for the problem, everyone admits 
that they did not foresee all the possible consequences of the election. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, City Manager Jim Arnold relaxed the freeze slightly, allowing 
permits for room additions, minor repairs and the installation of appliances 
essential to health and safety, such as water heaters and gas furnaces. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has scheduled an emergency meeting Monday night to study the 
city's legal options. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that it will be a long and heated meeting," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
But Aleshire -- who authored the impartial analysis of the ballot measures -- 
was not optimistic about the city's situation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the city declared the General Plan to be valid and began to 
issue permits, it would be vulnerable to a lawsuit by slow-growth activists who 
sought the defeat of the measures. But if no permits are issued, he said, local 
developers might try to sue the city for causing them economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we get sued by either side or both sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sabatasso, a Lawndale developer whose permit to build a 14-unit 
condominium project on Larch Avenue is being held up, said he is upset about 
the situation but does not plan to sue. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole City Council should resign," he said. "There is no leadership." 
</P>
<P>
He said that each month that his project is delayed will cost him about $3,000, 
and he blames city officials for failing to foresee the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"As a developer I try to cooperate with the city . . . but they keep changing 
all the rules," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, Aleshire said he will offer the City Council some legal 
options, but he has no immediate solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"By Monday night I hope I can give a recommendation that makes sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible for the city to ask the state Office of Planning and Research to 
approve an interim permitting process, but "that could take months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the election, Arnold said the city is preparing an 
update of the General Plan, which could run 300 to 800 pages. But finishing it 
could take nine to 15 months, and once it is done, Arnold said, he is not sure 
how to get the city's 9,700 registered voters to read and approve of something 
so long and complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, city officials and activists have been quick to blame each 
other for the city's crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday, city officials generally supported the ballot measures, while a 
handful of slow-growth advocates stood in opposition, saying the measures would 
take away voters' control over the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Now the sides are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Many people -- including some council members -- agreed that the City Council 
is partly at fault for missing the deadline to file ballot arguments supporting 
the three ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I think everybody's to blame," said Gary McDonald, a 
former planning commissioner and development consultant. "I don't think one 
single person caused it." 
</P>
<P>
However, McDonald, Councilman Larry Rudolph and city activist Nancy Marthens 
said that some of the blame is Aleshire's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very clear that the city attorney failed to indicate that this 
would happen," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph agreed, saying that Aleshire's impartial analysis of the measures 
should have told the voters all of the ramifications of the election outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire -- refusing to take the blame -- said he warned the council several 
times about the potential outcome of the election and said his impartial 
analysis on the ballot also made clear all of the ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way they can say that the people had no way of knowing about the 
potential disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said some of the blame belongs with the state attorney general's office, 
which changed its legal opinions about Ordinance 82 between 1974 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the attorney general said Ordinance 82 could be ignored because it was 
unconstitutional. As a result, the council adopted the current General Plan in 
1976 without voter approval. However, last December, the attorney general's 
office reviewed the earlier opinion and said it was erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal raised the question of whether Lawndale has a valid General Plan, 
because it was not adopted by the electorate as required by Ordinance 82. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is an outcome of the attorney general's opinion," Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who admits that he should have been more vocal in supporting the 
measures, also found fault with Marthens, Steve Mino, Herman Weinstein and 
Virginia Rhodes, the activists who wrote and signed the ballot arguments 
opposing the ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
He accuses them of misleading the voters by oversimplifying the issues in the 
ballot argument. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens responded to McDonald's charges by asking, "Where was his ballot 
argument in favor?" 
</P>
<P>
However, Marthens and Mino both said that when they wrote the ballot arguments 
they did not foresee the halt to all city development. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking for spite and we are not playing games. This is serious," 
Marthens said. ". . . (But) I didn't want to shut down the city." 
</P>
<P>
Mino agreed and said his only intentions were to force the city to adopt an 
up-to-date General Plan and implement some long-term planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to stop them from issuing building permits, we just want good 
building policies," he said.

DESERT ADDICTION;

<P>
CRANK IS ON THE RISE AS THE WORKING-CLASS METHAMPHETAMINE OF THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Crank, speed, go-fast medicine -- the street names of methamphetamine, the drug 
of choice for many in the Antelope Valley, reflect the rhythm of life in a boom 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine, particularly a super-potent smokable form known as ice, has 
gained attention nationally as the potential problem drug of the future. In the 
Antelope Valley, methamphetamine is the drug of the present. And law 
enforcement officials expect that ice, which remains rare in the area, will 
arrive in quantity soon. 
</P>
<P>
The use and production of methamphetamine apparently have increased with the 
area's growth. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies say they are seizing 
larger quantities of methamphetamine and making more arrests for the drug, 
about four times as many as for cocaine. They could provide no statistics. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, they have raided four clandestine labs where the drug was 
cooked. Administrators of drug counseling centers say the number of 
methamphetamine cases is rising steadily while other drug abuse appears to be 
dropping. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more of it around," said Sgt. Lance Galletch of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department narcotics unit based in Lancaster. "As enforcement against 
cocaine gets stronger, we'll see more meth. It's made in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
Economic, cultural and geographic factors have made crank king in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An economy driven by the aerospace and construction industries has created a 
sizable and predominantly white working class, the traditional consumers of 
methamphetamine. Prosecutors, sheriff's officials, treatment professionals and 
drug users say methamphetamine has become part of the work culture because it 
is affordable and gives the illusion of boundless energy. They say it offers a 
sense of insulation from the pressures of heavy labor, long hours, distant 
commutes and young families to feed. 
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, the valley's barren expanses of desert on the east and 
mountains on the west are ideal for methamphetamine traffickers. Heavily armed 
groups set up fortified laboratories in isolated farmhouses where the drug is 
cooked, a process that involves volatile chemicals and creates a powerful 
stench. 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine can be snorted, injected, smoked or taken in pill form. About 
70% of Antelope Valley users snort, a narcotics detective said, but a growing 
number are using hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in use of the drug builds on a tradition of use by truck drivers, 
motorcycle groups and dieting women, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been seeing it for 15 years," said Clancy Corbett, director of the 
Antelope Valley Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The crank high resembles the euphoria produced by cocaine, said Dr. Rodney 
Stillian, who heads the chemical dependency unit at Palmdale Hospital Medical 
Center. The uplifting effects are less powerful than cocaine but last longer, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong sense of well-being," Stillian said. "A strong sense of 
positive feeling about others. You feel good about the way others feel about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't sleep," said a former addict, who asked to be identified as Stacey. 
"You don't dream even if you do sleep, so you're never well-rested. You 
hallucinate . . . from lack of sleep. . . . For me to get out of bed my 
7-year-old daughter used to have to make my lines for me. She'd get my purse, 
get out my stuff, get a straw and chop up lines for me." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say entrepreneurial Los Angeles street gangs have recently expanded 
their crack cocaine operations to Lancaster and Palmdale. But the demand for 
methamphetamine has not declined, say narcotics detectives and prosecutors. 
Crank and crack rarely mix. 
</P>
<P>
"In this particular town, people will tell you they prefer speed to coke," a 
narcotics detective said. "They'll tell you it makes them a little crazier." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say the valley's drug world appears divided along 
racial lines, with the use and sale of cocaine dominated by blacks and the use 
and sale of methamphetamine dominated by whites. Authorities said they have yet 
to see an attempt by either group to expand into the other's market. 
</P>
<P>
The average crank user is a salaried worker between 20 and 30 years old who 
likely began using the drug as an adult, Stillian said. A regular user will 
spend about $25 for enough drug to last one to three days, he and others said. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the Palmdale Hospital Medical Center drug treatment unit's 
patients are methamphetamine cases, with cocaine users making up about 
one-fifth, Stillian said. Many drug abusers combine methamphetamine with 
alcohol, creating a cycle where they are dependent on crank to get going in the 
morning and on alcohol to come down at night. 
</P>
<P>
Workplace pressures, especially in the fast-paced construction and aircraft 
industries, may explain the alarming growth of methamphetamine, Stillian said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no glamour here. It is a worker's drug. . . . In Los Angeles you have 
a lot of wealthy people using cocaine, a lot of poor folks using cocaine. Here 
we have a lot of people in the middle -- working people trying to pay bills." 
</P>
<P>
A counselor who deals with drug use in the Antelope Valley's aerospace industry 
reported seeing more abuse of methamphetamine than any other drug except 
alcohol. The counselor, who asked not to be named, cited round-the-clock 
shifts, mandatory overtime and the pressures of government contracts as causes. 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine use "can run from hourly workers all the way up to management," 
the counselor said. The counselor said the 12-hour workdays and six- or 
seven-day workweeks common in the industry contribute to the demand for the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
He said the long shifts "are crazy in a lot of ways. . . . Efficiency goes down 
the tube and only the body is there." 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine may be a drug of the times because users believe that rather 
than providing an escape from pressures, it makes them more productive. 
</P>
<P>
"The repetitive boredom of what they are doing is often a factor," Stillian 
said. "The more boring the job . . . the more likely for the worker to be 
using. It gives a strong sense that they are doing the job better." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey, the former user, said: "I would stay up all night doing the things I 
hadn't had time to do in the day because of the kids, PTA, work, whatever. I 
felt like I was getting a lot done." 
</P>
<P>
It takes up to a year for a methamphetamine addiction to take hold, as opposed 
to only 30 days for crack cocaine, Stillian said. But crank's potential for 
causing brain damage is greater than with cocaine, he said. Like cocaine, crank 
assaults the heart and other organs. Extreme addicts tend to be gaunt, pale, 
irritable and paranoid, with rotting teeth and sores. 
</P>
<P>
The paranoia can be dramatic. A former user described a friend in the advanced 
stages of addiction who has taken refuge in a trailer in the Antelope Valley 
and will not come out, convinced that "men in black hats are coming to get 
her." 
</P>
<P>
The drug is produced by outlaw amateur chemists who are often members or 
affiliates of motorcycle gangs that get a piece of the action, authorities 
said. A biker gang called the Hessians has been active in the Antelope Valley 
trade, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel N. Damon, the Lancaster specialist in 
drug lab cases. 
</P>
<P>
Some cooks are local, but others travel a circuit of labs in the Inland Empire 
or north San Diego County, which law enforcement officials consider the 
methamphetamine production capitals of the nation. Like those areas, the 
Antelope Valley's geography provides an abundance of potential lab sites. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing process requires about $3,000 worth of glassware and 
chemicals including three basic ingredients: red phosphorus, hydriodic acid and 
phedrine, which is illegal in California and must be brought in from other 
states. The chemicals are mixed and heated for eight to 11 hours in a large 
flask, then filtered for impurities and cooled. Exposure to Freon gas converts 
the product, meth oil, into powder form. 
</P>
<P>
A pound of pure methamphetamine costs about $10,000, detectives said, but it 
can sell for much more if cut with other substances. Increased filtering of 
impurities yields a better grade: crystal meth and ice, for example, are highly 
purified forms. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking is dangerous because the toxic chemicals are explosive and some cooks 
are users who stay wired through the two- or three-day process. Others stay 
straight while cooking in labs that could pass for the workplaces of 
professional chemists. Cooks are often paid with a percentage of their product. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department's anti-meth efforts generally focus on labs, with the 
narcotics unit making an average of three to five raids per year. One of the 
biggest lab busts in Los Angeles County history took place two years ago in a 
farmhouse in the west Antelope Valley community of Fairmont. In that raid, 
deputies confiscated an arsenal of weapons and 55 gallons of methamphetamine 
oil worth millions of dollars on the street. 
</P>
<P>
This year, 13 gallons were seized in a raid on a trailer in the Leona Valley 
area after authorities received a tip from a resident who noticed a strange 
odor while horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are cautious when making raids because of the hazardous materials 
used in the process and also because some labs are booby-trapped, Galletch 
said. Hazardous materials units dismantle the labs once any threat from the 
manufacturers has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always weapons," he said. "At one lab we seized dynamite and a full 
auto M-16 rifle. One place had C-4 plastique explosive rigged under the 
driveway." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said lab raids often depend on tips or chance discoveries. Unlike 
the urban street trade of crack cocaine, methamphetamine dealing is more 
dispersed so the secretive criminal networks that control the trade do not 
engage in the high-profile turf combat common among urban drug gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, said prosecutor Damon, the traffickers can be "vicious and brutal" if 
their trade is threatened or if someone is cooking in their territory without 
their permission. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the next stage in the rise of methamphetamine in the valley 
will likely be the appearance of smokable ice, which has gained headlines in 
Hawaii and in San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Users and authorities say ice has yet to arrive in significant quantity. But 
prosecutor Damon said: "Every drug will make its way through here. I hate to 
sound pessimistic, but we will probably see more."

105 DRIVERS ARRESTED IN 1ST NIGHT OF SWEEP; 
</P>
<P>
CRACKDOWN: ABOUT 150 POLICE OFFICERS BLANKET THE VALLEY IN THE DEPARTMENT'S 
LARGEST EFFORT AGAINST DRUNK DRIVERS. THEY INTEND TO KEEP THE HEAT ON THROUGH 
NEW YEAR'S.

Police arrested 105 motorists on suspicion of drunk driving in the San Fernando 
Valley Friday night and early Saturday morning in what they said was the 
largest single-night effort ever to catch motorists driving while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign this weekend is an effort to notify the public that drinking and 
driving will not be tolerated," said Sgt. Ray Lombardo of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
During the drunk-driving sweep, 150 officers, most of them on motorcycles, 
patrolled the streets across the Valley from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., Sgt. Dennis Zine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another task force hit the streets Saturday night, joined by California Highway 
Patrol officers on area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep was expected to conclude early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Unannounced sweeps will be conducted from now until after the New Year's 
holiday, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of setting up sobriety checkpoints, police fanned out across the Valley 
watching for possibly drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were arrested were taken to a special Immediate Booking and Release 
System station, consisting of two converted buses parked behind the Van Nuys 
division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
After administering an alcohol test and fingerprinting the suspects, the 
arresting officers immediately returned to the streets to look for more drunk 
drivers while other police employees booked those who had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Those who refused to be tested for alcohol could have their licenses 
automatically suspended for a year, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, only about 20 officers are assigned to combat drunk driving in the 
Valley, Lombardo said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, those officers focus on one of the Police Department's five Valley 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep also differed from usual enforcement efforts because it was joined by 
officers from all five LAPD divisions in the Valley as well as Valley traffic 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
About 23% of the fatal accidents in the Valley this year have involved a drunk 
driver, Lombardo said. "So our efforts are aimed at taking the drunk driver off 
the street before he's involved in an accident," he added. 
</P>
<P>
By Nov. 4, 23 people had been killed in traffic accidents involving drunk 
drivers in the Valley this year, according to police statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk-driving accidents during the period, however, actually decreased about 
14% compared with last year, from 1,575 to 1,348.

South Bay Democrats want to sic a pack of candidates on incumbent U.S. Rep. 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) when the former Reagan speech writer runs for 
reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Democratic Committee member Steve Beale and Ruth McGrew, who 
chairs the Palos Verdes Democratic Club, say the strategy will give more 
exposure to Democratic issues in the heavily Republican 42nd Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
And if the Democratic candidates agree not to tear one another apart, Beale 
says, that could cause problems for Rohrabacher: "There's something to be said 
for having different people who are in a good position to go after him from a 
number of different angles." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only Democrat publicly expressing an interest in entering the race 
is Guy Kimbrough, the Mt. San Jacinto College political science instructor who 
Rohrabacher beat last year by an almost 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very serious about running, but the formal announcement probably won't be 
made until January," Kimbrough says, adding that he expects several Democrats 
to enter the race. "It's best to spread the Democratic message throughout the 
42nd District, and a good way to do that is to have a lot of candidates out and 
about." George Hatch

If the reaction of his South Bay colleague, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills, is any 
indication, state Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd was wise not to ask the 
Legislature to put his sports betting proposal on the November, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad public policy for the state of California to get into gambling," says 
Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee, 
a panel that handles gambling legislation. "It's somewhat juvenile and 
hypocritical to believe that to legalize something that's not good will make it 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd (D-Carson) is avoiding the Legislature and turning to the public instead. 
On Oct. 30, he filed a sports betting initiative that will appear on the ballot 
if supporters gather the valid signatures of 595,485 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd says his proposal represents a good way to put bookies out of business 
and to create a new tax source to raise money for state programs for the 
elderly and basic local services such as police protection. Dills disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad that we can't take care of the elderly and pay for police without 
resorting to bad solutions like gambling," says the senator, who favors 
increasing the state income tax instead. "There's no greater gamble than the 
stock market these days. If (people) want to gamble, why don't we just let 'em 
gamble on that?" George Hatch

<P>
BEVERLY PARK: HOUSES IN AN UNFINISHED PROJECT BELOW MULHOLLAND DRIVE ARE RANKED 
WITH ELEGANT MANSIONS.

Developers of the hilltop Beverly Park Estates have published the second 
edition of a lush coffee-table book called "The Estates of Beverly Hills," 
complete with a chapter that puts their scenic but largely unbuilt neighborhood 
on a par with the fanciest homes of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted our future audience . . . to find through reading this book that 
there's a new opportunity in town," said Brian Adler, principal developer of 
the property high above Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity people haven't had since the 1930s -- to get a house on 
two level acres . . . with city and canyon views," he said. "It's the feeling 
of what an estate is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Carved out of the hillsides north of Beverly Hills in the 1960s by bulldozers 
moving 8 million cubic yards of earth, the land was originally intended for a 
country club project that was to have been named after entertainer Dean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
That deal fell through, along with several other efforts involving a Teamsters 
Union pension fund, but developer Elliot Gottfurcht managed to consolidate 16 
lots on part of the property, a ridge overlooking Franklin Canyon, before he 
sold out to Adler and his associates last year. 
</P>
<P>
The first edition of "The Estates of Beverly Hills," financed by Gottfurcht, 
came out in 1984, filled with stories and pictures of the stately homes of 
Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills. Hoping for gilt by association, 
Gottfurcht devoted a few of the book's oversized, 100% rag cotton pages to 
sketches of the yet-unbuilt mansions of Beverly Park Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The latest edition, published this time by Adler, went on sale last month for 
$100 at bookstores and upscale outlets such as Neiman-Marcus. It expands its 
coverage of some of the older homes in Beverly Hills and neighboring high-rent 
districts. But it also features 14 pages of color photographs showing the 
gushing fountains, curling driveways, landscaped vistas and highly decorated 
interiors of houses built in the first phase of Beverly Park. 
</P>
<P>
The first 16 lots were limited in size to flat pads of about one acre each, but 
the next batch of 64 properties, in a man-made bowl below Mulholland Drive, 
will be twice as big -- big enough for almost anybody's dream house, not to 
mention tennis court, guest house, pool and lots of lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most expensive" real estate "brochure ever circulated," said 
Jeffrey Hyland, a Beverly Hills real estate broker who wrote the book with 
Charles Lockwood, an architecture and travel writer. "And the most important 
thing is that no one realizes this is a promotional brochure." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the privately printed, 170-page volume stands on its own merits. Hyland 
and Lockwood, together with researcher Peter V. Persic and photographers 
Randolph Harrison and Baron Wolman, have made a genuine contribution to local 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Their text, based on a combing of old newspaper files and the comments of 
longtime residents, complements glowing photo layouts of some of the grandest 
chateaux this side of the Loire Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The writers do not hide the pitfalls of living on a grand scale. Some of the 
oil barons and movie moguls who built for the centuries ended their lives in 
poverty, forced to sell out for as little as $200,000 at a time when lavish 
estates were a drag on the market. 
</P>
<P>
But with athletes and entertainers raking in greater earnings every year, the 
market for great houses is a lively one today. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has already sold houses in the remote, gated community to the 
Lakers' Magic Johnson, entertainer Pia Zadora and her multimillionaire husband, 
Meshulam Riklis, and others in the seven-figures-and-up income bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of them learned about it through 'The Estates of Beverly Hills,' but 
mainly it was through word of mouth," said Adler, who has been involved in the 
project since 1979. "I've been very low-key about it, but when the most 
affluent buyers, the ones for whom a few million dollars either way doesn't 
matter, picked us, that's the greatest compliment, because they can be 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when buyers of run-down mansions are confronted with rehabilitation 
costs of $1 million or more, Hyland said, there should be a lively demand for 
the two-acre estates of Beverly Park, where empty lots are going for $3.5 
million to $5 million and completed houses are expected to cost $8 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing today is big estates," said Hyland, whose firm of Alvarez, 
Hyland &amp; Young is the fourth-largest real estate brokerage in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for us to sell a house for $10 million than for $2 million or $3 
million," because "there are more people on the high end than on the low end, 
and they'd rather pay you another $1.5 million or more to build a house for 
them than do it themselves," Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
The clients "would rather spend the time on their own business, and they don't 
want a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
The authors were especially proud of their entree to the Warner and Kirkeby 
estates, which are concealed behind gates and greenery and have not been 
photographed for public consumption in decades, although the facade of the 
Kirkeby house is known to millions as the home of the nouveau-riche Clampett 
clan in "The Beverly Hillbillies" television series. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland and Lockwood said they were besieged by property owners whose houses 
were left out of their chronicle of conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"People would call up and say: 'You've got to put me in this time. I've put on 
a 10,000-square-foot addition,' " Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors spelled out their standards in the foreword: A property must 
have at least 1 1/2 acres of flat land to be considered an estate. The only 
exceptions in the book are the homes from the first phase of publisher Adler's 
development, Beverly Park. Some famous homes were excluded because much of the 
surrounding land was subdivided and sold off over the years. Others with large 
grounds did not have enough flat land. 
</P>
<P>
Only 31 properties qualified in Beverly Hills, 22 in Holmby Hills and 15 in 
Bel-Air. The book also counts the 64 two-acre lots in Beverly Park Estates, 
which have yet to be built on. 
</P>
<P>
"Omission from this book does not imply that a residence is any less attractive 
or any less valuable than the properties that are featured," Hyland and 
Lockwood wrote. 
</P>
<P>
They also made it clear that homeowners whose dream houses did not make it into 
the second edition will have to learn to live with the ignominy. There will not 
be a third. 
</P>
<P>
"Both have written extensively about Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills and Bel-Air," 
the foreword says about the authors. "This book represents the completion of 
their work on these estate properties."

BEHEMOTH FROM BEVERLY HILLS ANGERS BRENTWOOD NEIGHBORS

<P>
She calls it the Nightmare on Wellesley Street. It came to her neighborhood 
like a bad dream, without warning. In the middle of a September night. In more 
than one segment. 
</P>
<P>
Amelia Warwick said she must face the "monstrosity" daily in her South 
Brentwood neighborhood, and she and other horrified homeowners want to send it 
back where it came from. 
</P>
<P>
The object of their scorn is a boxy duplex moved west from Beverly Hills and 
planted at 832 Wellesley St., which is actually an avenue that ends at Montana 
Avenue, across the street from the Brentwood Country Club boundary. 
</P>
<P>
The offending structure covers 94% of its lot in a neighborhood in which most 
homes occupy about 25% of the property. The duplex is tall enough to dwarf the 
surrounding bungalows and will have an apartment-like stairway running 
diagonally across the front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Although the behemoth from Beverly Hills took most of the neighbors by 
surprise, its cross-town move was approved by the city Department of Building 
and Safety as befitting the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
An effort by the South Brentwood Homeowners Assn. to have the permit revoked by 
the Building and Safety Commission was denied Tuesday on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else these people want from us," developer Arnie Corlin, 
co-owner of the duplex, told the commission. Corlin said he viewed the 
building, built in the late '30s on Camden Drive in Beverly Hills, as an asset 
to the area. 
</P>
<P>
It will get a new front and be tastefully painted and landscaped, he said. 
Ultimately, Corlin said in an interview, he and a partner hope to sell the two 
units as condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 residents trekked downtown to City Hall to protest the granting of the 
permit, with their councilman, Marvin Braude, leading the charge. The 
commission received 86 letters opposing the relocated building. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal was based on a provision of the law that requires a relocated 
building to conform to its new location as to size, architecture and design. 
"This is a gross deviation from the neighborhood standards," Braude argued to 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Robert Breech noted that at 6,200 square feet, the duplex has twice 
the square footage of the largest dwelling on the street, where the majority of 
houses are in the range of 1,000 to 1,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Breech said the rectangular design of the building was disparagingly called a 
"dingbat" by architects. "Cars literally slow in their tracks to observe it," 
he said. "It should be lifted up and taken out." 
</P>
<P>
Residents were not forewarned that the building would be arriving because no 
public notice is required when a building is relocated, according to department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Corlin said he talked to some neighbors before moving the duplex, but 
some of them claim that he misrepresented the building. Attorney and homeowner 
Sheldon Jaffe said after the hearing that his wife and another neighbor were 
told the day before the duplex was moved that they "were moving in the most 
beautiful Spanish duplex ever seen in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
A building and safety inspector approved the project, using guidelines in the 
ordinance that require surveying buildings within 1,000 feet of the site. 
Because there are large buildings a few blocks away on Montana in an area zoned 
for apartments, the inspector found the duplex suitable for the area. 
</P>
<P>
To the neighbors, it sticks out like a sore thumb. The neighborhood, south of 
Montana and north of Wilshire Boulevard, between Bundy Drive and Wellesley 
Avenue, is filled for the most part with small houses of various designs and 
vintage. They are set back from the street with atypically large front yards, 
giving the area an expansive, green look. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few other visible signs that the neighborhood has been discovered. 
Remodeling projects are under way, and a few large homes dot the area. But the 
relocated building galvanized the residents, said Ellie Pelcyger. "The 
obscenity of this one just upset everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Pelcyger, a member of the homeowners' appeal committee, said members are 
reviewing their next step and may file suit. "If building and safety won't 
enforce the law, we're investigating who will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Warren O'Brien, who heads the department, told the commissioners after the 
vote that the problem was the ordinance itself, which requires an inspector to 
take into account buildings within 1,000 feet, even though they may be on a 
major street zoned for large buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Although commissioners expressed the hope that Corlin would work with 
homeowners to mitigate their objections, the climate does not seem favorable. 
Corlin said that he keeps finding nasty notes and other unspecified mischief in 
his building each day and that his workers are being harassed by passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Residents accused Corlin of lying on his application for a permit. Jaffe told 
the commissioners that the developer had understated the size of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Corlin said any misstatement was unintentional and had been corrected.

POLITICIANS ACT FAST TO RUN FOR CAMPBELL'S SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: WOULD-BE STATE SENATORS SIZE UP THEIR CHANCES TO FILL THE VACANCY 
THAT WILLIAM CAMPBELL WILL CREATE WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE.

<P>
Sen. William Campbell's surprise decision to step down from office is enticing 
San Gabriel Valley-area politicians to study voter registration figures and 
consult strategists to decide whether they should attempt a scramble up the 
political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the Oct. 26 announcement by the Hacienda Heights Republican, 
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) jumped into the Senate race, prompting at 
least seven would-be candidates, including former Assemblyman Wayne Grisham, to 
consider whether to seek his Assembly job. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who is serving his 
third term in the lower house, announced that he, too, would be a candidate for 
Republican Campbell's 31st Senate District seat. The sprawling district 
straddles parts of Southeast Los Angeles County, the San Gabriel Valley and 
stretches south to El Toro in Orange County. Among the district's registered 
voters, Republicans have a 54% to 36% lead over Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Ferguson said that, in part, he was prompted to run 
because "Los Angeles-area lawmakers now dominate the Legislature" and that "no 
one from Orange County has ever represented the district," even though more 
than half the voters live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other Republicans are considering the race. Brea City Councilman 
Ron Isles last Monday said he is "95% certain" he will run for the Senate. And 
Diamond Bar City Councilman Gary Miller said he might enter the contest for the 
seat, which will become vacant in January. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he has not made up his mind whether he will endorse a candidate 
to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, 51, said he is willing to spend $500,000 of his money on the campaign. 
In a statement, he indicated that ethics could be an issue, warning that "the 
candidates who decide to enter this contest better not be carrying any 
political baggage." In an interview, Isles said the statement was not aimed at 
Ferguson or Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ferguson, 66, failed to properly report some personal income and 
amended his economic disclosure statement after newspaper stories revealed the 
discrepancy. The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 35, is one of the five elected state officials who are targets of an 
ongoing FBI investigation into political corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who previously had been advised not to make statements to the media about 
the investigation, said last Tuesday: "I know as much about it as I read in the 
newspapers. I haven't done anything wrong, and I'm running." 
</P>
<P>
But Democrat Janice Lynn Graham, 53, who last year ran for Campbell's seat, 
maintained that Hill "has a cloud over his head with the FBI . . . that might 
create a problem for him." Graham, a retired businesswoman and teacher from 
Laguna Hills, said she is exploring whether to seek the office, despite losing 
to Campbell by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's Senate seat and Hill's Assembly seat are regarded by campaign 
consultants as relatively safe for the GOP because registered Republicans 
outnumber Democrats in both districts. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats acknowledge that capturing either district would be a long shot. But 
privately, several Democratic legislative staffers say the party might be 
willing to pump money into a campaign if Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San 
Diego) wins a December special election in what is also regarded as a safe 
Republican Senate district in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell officially steps down in January, and the secretary of state's office 
said Gov. George Deukmejian could call the primary in March or April with a 
runoff, if necessary, in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office said Hill or Ferguson could file for reelection 
to the Assembly while campaigning for the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who estimates that he has $260,000 in his Assembly war chest, said he is 
undecided whether he will seek both seats at the same time. If he ran for 
reelection to the Assembly and won, a special election for his seat might not 
be held for another year, state election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of campaign contribution limits approved last year by voters on the 
special election is also unclear. 
</P>
<P>
In Hill's district, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 48% to 43%. The 
district includes Walnut, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, a large part of 
Whittier, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights and parts of Industry, 
West Covina and South Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Republicans lining up for Hill's seat, Grisham, 66, is the most well 
known. A former La Mirada city councilman, Grisham represented part of the 
district during two terms in Congress from 1978-82. After losing his 
congressional seat and serving as a Peace Corps official, Grisham established a 
voting residence in Norwalk. He won two elections to the 63rd Assembly 
District, but last year narrowly lost a reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham, who has been serving as a broker in his son's real estate office, 
confirmed that he is "seriously considering" making another political comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Also considering the race is Walnut Mayor Drexel Smith, a 43-year-old 
Republican. Smith, who is running for reelection to the City Council, said: 
"I'm looking at it as an option and an opportunity that needs to be evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
If Hill does not seek reelection, Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, 38, 
said he will be a candidate for the Assembly. Ken Manning, 38, a member of the 
Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District, said there is a strong possibility 
he too will be a candidate for the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Another Republican regarded as a potential candidate is Barbara Shell Stone of 
Whittier. But last Wednesday, Stone, who finished second to Hill in the 1982 
GOP primary, said: "There's no opening so I'm not going to deal with it. . . . 
That's not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans who say they might be interested in seeking Hill's seat 
include Dan Pellissier, 29, of Whittier, a former aide to Grisham and to Senate 
Minority Leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), who is now a public affairs analyst with 
Southern California Gas Co.; Tony Russo, 26, a former aide to Hill and Grisham 
now serving as chief of staff to Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), and 
Ray Andersen, 33, of Diamond Bar, a former deputy to County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Also mentioned as a possible candidate is Democrat Terry Lee Perkins of Walnut, 
who lost to Hill in 1988.

COUNTY DELAYS DECISION ON BIG ROCK MESA DRAINAGE SYSTEM TAX; 
</P>
<P>
ASSESSMENTS: THE PLAN PROPOSES TRIPLING PROPERTY TAXES TO HELP PREVENT 
LANDSLIDES. ONE IN 1983 DESTROYED OR DAMAGED 250 HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County plan to tax Big Rock Mesa homeowners more than $100,000 
each for a drainage system to stabilize their landslide-plagued community was 
delayed again last week, after too few members of the Board of Supervisors were 
present to act on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are scheduled to consider the matter on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's delay was the second time the proposal has been stalled since county 
officials in June announced plans to more than triple the Malibu homeowners' 
tax assessment to pay for an elaborate system to prevent another devastating 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
County officials in September presented a $13.8-million improvement package to 
the supervisors, but the board delayed approval after protests from Big Rock 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the plan is too expensive for them to bear alone and does not 
guarantee against another disaster on the order of a 1983 slide that damaged or 
destroyed 250 homes. 
</P>
<P>
After 4 1/2 years of litigation, the county, the California Department of 
Transportation, dozens of insurance companies and attorneys for about 240 Big 
Rock homeowners reached a settlement in January that will pay the homeowners 
$97 million -- or about $200,000 apiece after legal fees -- for the damage they 
suffered as a result of the 1983 slide. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those same residents, as well as some who were not part of the 
lawsuit and others who bought homes at Big Rock Mesa after the litigation 
began, were stunned by the county's plans to triple their property taxes to 
help pay for stabilizing the slide-prone promontory. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and county officials have met several times since the September delay 
to try to reach a compromise, but both sides acknowledge that there has been 
little progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We're essentially where we were a month ago," Thomas Tidemanson, county public 
works director, told the supervisors last week. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have the authority to impose a settlement. However, by law, 
since a majority of the property owners have protested the assessment, imposing 
a settlement requires the approval of at least four of the five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, with Supervisors Pete Schabarum and Kenneth Hahn absent, the board 
listened to several residents argue for trimming the cost of the project and 
more county help in paying for it, before continuing the matter until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Murdock, an attorney for the homeowners, called the question of whether 
the county is willing to help pay for the drainage system "the big nut" 
standing in the way of a plan that residents could support. 
</P>
<P>
He and others argued that the county should help pay for the system since any 
improvements to stabilize Big Rock will reduce the county's risk of liability 
from future slides. 
</P>
<P>
However, Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district includes Malibu, expressed 
little enthusiasm for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We just finished closing down a group of family planning clinics for lack of 
funds," he said. "If we give you, say, a couple of million dollars, we're going 
to have to sit here and determine what other program has to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
Dana also took a dim view of Supervisor Ed Edelman's request that county 
officials investigate, before Tuesday, whether county road funds might be used 
to cover part of the cost, since a major slide on the mesa could pose a threat 
to Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you really suggesting that people in your district, and the other 
districts, should contribute to this?" Dana asked. 
</P>
<P>
However, the homeowners saw a ray of light, even though Edelman said he "only 
wanted to explore the possibility" and was "not saying that we would do it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was an encouraging sign," homeowner Mike Caggiano said. "I'm trying 
to be optimistic."

STORY OF COMPTON SCHOOLTEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was interesting to read your article titled "Inner-City Teachers: Well, It 
Isn't the Paycheck." (Times, Nov. 5). It was a positive piece reflecting the 
dedication of teachers in the Compton Unified School District. I am proud of 
those teachers and they deserve to be commended. 
</P>
<P>
My rhetorical question is why did the title say "Inner-City" teachers, as 
opposed to "Compton" teachers? If it had been a negative article, you can bet 
that it would have used the word Compton. In any event, I am on my way to 
personally compliment the Compton teachers you cited for their commitment to 
their profession.

Minerva Court, an unusual 1925 complex of single-family homes, has been 
designated a historical district. The block of 15 homes was built in the 
Spanish Colonial Revival style by a single developer and a single contractor 
along a narrow, private street south of 11th Street and east of Gaviota Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The modest homes of stucco walls, arches and flat roofs, arranged in a

A LESSON IN U.S.-JAPAN AWARENESS;

EDUCATION: STUDENTS FROM JAPAN VISIT A SANTA MONICA HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNICATE 
A WEALTH OF AMITY WITH GESTURES AND LAUGHTER.

<P>
The miles that separate Fukuoka, Japan, and Santa Monica seemed less formidable 
last week after students from Oki Gakuen and St. Monica high schools met and 
discovered some common interests: music, sports, pizza and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just typical teen-agers -- just from a different place, a different 
part of the world," St. Monica senior Kathy Bailey said of the Japanese 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 students from Oki Gakuen High School in Fukuoka, Japan, spent the day 
at St. Monica High School in Santa Monica last Monday, getting a glimpse of 
student life in America. 
</P>
<P>
They toured the school, watched scenes from the school play, "Frankenstein," 
ate a lunch of pizza and submarine sandwiches, danced to the latest rap music 
at a "sock hop" held in their honor, and played volleyball against the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help broaden their eyes," said Toshiyuki Yoshinaga, an English 
teacher at Oki Gakuen. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, students from Oki Gakuen have visited St. Monica and 
other Catholic schools in the Los Angeles area. This year, 650 will visit 15 
schools in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The students have to pay their own way, $1,400 each, but teachers on both sides 
believe that the experience outweighs the cost.

<P>
"God knows we need more opportunities to create understanding between people, 
and this certainly does that," said Teresa Dickey, English teacher at St. 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Students who have taken Dickey's world literature class have read some Japanese 
literature. The day was a day of cultural sharing, Dickey said, and it was full 
of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to school from Monday through Saturday, 7:30 to 4:30," said Stephanie 
Teves of her Japanese friends. "That's wild." 
</P>
<P>
Masaru Tomohara, 17, seemed equally surprised to learn that schools in this 
country are co-ed. "I think its good. It looks fun," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to the United States was the first for teacher Yoshinaga, as well as 
the students. He was struck by the openness of the American schools, the 
open-minded attitudes of the students and the lack of formality. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things are impressive for the student, and they are going to remember," 
Yoshinaga said, adding that Japanese schools need to "move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting around a table during lunch, Stephanie got a quick lesson in origami, a 
Japanese form of paper art. Carefully following the motions of her partner, 
Masako Yamashito, Stephanie folded a small square of red and white paper. 
</P>
<P>
"See, it doesn't look like yours," she said, surveying her finished creation. 
</P>
<P>
Masako laughed, holding her neatly folded origami bird next to that of her 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
"She's laughing at me, . . . that's not a good sign," Stephanie said with a 
playful grin. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither group was adept at speaking the other's language, the students 
quickly learned to communicate. In place of words, they used hand gestures, 
head nods, and lots of smiles and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"When they get one-on-one, it's an international language," said Sister Cheryl 
Milner, principal at St. Monica. "They come away changed." 
</P>
<P>
Julio Quinteros, captain of the football team, said he had no problem 
communicating with his partner, Hidekazu Fujiki, 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's because he's an athlete, too. We understand each other." Fujiki 
is a black belt in judo. 
</P>
<P>
David Martinez even got an opportunity to practice his Japanese. Under the 
watchful eye of his partner, Masaru, he carefully tried his hand at counting in 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Ichi, ni, san, yon, go, roku, shichi, hachi. . . . I always get stuck on that 
one," he said, trying to remember the Japanese word for nine. 
</P>
<P>
"Ku," Masaru reminded him. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's it!" David said. 
</P>
<P>
Later during the day, the rest of the senior class and others in school had an 
opportunity to meet the Japanese students at a dance and volleyball game. 
</P>
<P>
Rap music blared from the school auditorium as senior class members 
demonstrated the latest dances to their guests. 
</P>
<P>
Standing around in groups, the Japanese students seemed inhibited at first, but 
with a little coaxing from John McFarland, 17, some joined in, clapping and 
moving from side to side. The more adventurous joined a snaking line of 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"They adjusted so well. As soon as they saw their friends dancing, that just 
took the shyness away," McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
The underclassmen joined the seniors at a volleyball game and pep rally, 
complete with cheerleaders, drill team and class rivalries shouted across the 
stands. The Japanese students shed their school uniforms for sweats and 
T-shirts as the St. Monica students cheered, "Let's go Okis, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
The final score was St. Monica 15, Oki Gakuen 13. 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of the teachers, both sides were winners. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey said her students previously had felt intimidated by their Japanese 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
"They think, 'God, they're better in school, they do better in business, they 
can do so many things that we can't do," Dickey said. "But they're not 
(superhuman). They're just people like us. If (my students) learned that, then 
the day was successful."

GRANADA AVENUE LAUNCH RAMP RULES CHANGED TO ALLOW JET SKIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Parks and Recreation Marine Bureau has changed the use of the Granada 
Avenue beach launch ramp in Belmont Shore to allow for personal watercraft, 
which the Coast Guard describes as jet propelled vessels under 10 feet long, 
mainly jet skis. The ramp had been reserved for sailboats, which are no longer 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The following rules will apply on a trial basis through the end of the year: 
</P>
<P>
The launch area is marked by orange, steel-ball buoys at the east and west 
boundaries. The farthest seaward buoy of the eastern boundary is white. The 
buoys are not to be used as a slalom course. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no overnight stays or camping, no parking or leaving vehicles on 
the ramp, no dogs, no alcoholic beverages, and no driving on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
All operators must observe inland rules for prevention of collision at sea, 
safe vessel operation and all applicable California boating laws. 
</P>
<P>
The launch area will be open from 8 a.m. to dusk and will be supervised by 
lifeguards. There will be a $5 launch fee per vehicle and trailer, according to 
Mike Little, marine operations officer.

MARKETING 'DOGS' AND A 'MERMAID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JENEL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Little Mermaid" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven" aren't just competing at 
theaters this holiday season. Ariel, the ocean beauty, and Charlie, the rakish 
junkyard dog, will be vying for consumer attention in fast-food restaurants, 
department stores, toy and record shops and on TV and in print as well. 
</P>
<P>
The most direct clash will occur in the fast-food arena. Starting this Friday, 
Wendy's and McDonald's will go mano-a-mano with their respective "All Dogs" and 
"Mermaid" promotion campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
There will be Wendy's commercials and print ads featuring the company's "Dogs" 
promo, McDonald's commercials and print ads dedicated to hyping the chain's 
"Mermaid" campaign. Visitors will find McDonald's 8,110 franchises and Wendy's 
3,800 stops adorned with movie-themed decorations. And, of course, there will 
be cute items galore to help kids charm some money out of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers of McDonald's $2.09 Happy Meal will receive "Little Mermaid" bath toys, 
a different one each week for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's customers will be offered one of five 2 1/2-inch rubber "All Dogs Go to 
Heaven" figurines with the purchase of a $2.99 Kid's Meal. The "Dogs" 
characters will also be available with the purchase of a holiday gift 
certificate of $5 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Buy your $5 gift certificate at McDonald's instead and you can get a "Mermaid" 
Christmas tree ornament. 
</P>
<P>
Is this burger-based battle deliberate? It seems not. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's executives had no idea they would be bucking a Disney/McDonald's 
campaign when they cut their "Dogs" deal months ago with Sullivan-Bluth 
Productions, a company spokesman said. McDonald's declined to discuss any 
aspect of their plan, or Wendy's: "We wouldn't even begin to comment on someone 
else's program or our feelings about it," said a company rep. 
</P>
<P>
Both Disney and Sullivan-Bluth marketing executives consider their fast-food 
corporate tie-ins as the cornerstones of their campaigns. But there is much 
more. On the merchandise front, "All Dogs" licensees are producing posters, 
T-shirts, plush toys and kids' books that will be available at various retail 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sell, but not a hard sell," said Matt Mazer, "All Dogs" marketing and 
promotion consultant. "Our thrust is to get people to see the film rather than 
to sell books or toys." Mazer, a former Disney marketing executive, added that 
the gift products "are just part of our effort to get across the magic of the 
film." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's thrust, on the other hand, has a lot to do with getting across the 
magic of the merchandise. With 20 licensees aboard the "Mermaid" ship, the 
company is sailing into Macy's department stores, Disney Stores and numerous 
other outlets on a tidal wave of more than 100 different products. Among them: 
"Mermaid" dolls, plush toys, figurines, music boxes, stationery, sleeping bags, 
books, bed linens, children's sleepwear and a line of play clothes that 
includes aquamarine "Mermaid" raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is also out to capture grown-ups with its "Mermaid" goods. 
</P>
<P>
"For that, we're looking mostly in the apparel area," said Paul Pressler, 
Disney marketing vice president. "We have a collection of Calypso-style shirts 
in hot, bright colors. The designs are done and retailers are looking at them 
now. We hope they'll be out there by Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
If not, adult "Mermaid" fans will still have plenty to choose from: T-shirts 
featuring an Andy Warhol-style multiple image treatment of Ariel the mermaid; 
gift items featuring a character from the movie named "The Duke of Sole"; "surf 
'n' turf" tote bags that have make-believe characters and real sand trapped 
between layers of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Adults remember seeing the classic Disney animated films as kids," said Dan 
Coulter, Disney marketing manager, "so items like these have a strong emotional 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Disney has two separate ad campaigns to support its new animated effort 
-- one in the children's/family movie vein, the other aimed squarely at adults. 
The adult campaign, relying on art that features a moonlit silhouette of Ariel, 
is in evidence even in such typically un-Disney-like places as the pages of 
Rolling Stone magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Another showdown is shaping up between the two films' sound-track albums. 
</P>
<P>
Curb Records hopes to make a hit out of its "All Dogs" lead song, the ballad 
"Love Survives," which was written by Academy Award winners Al Kasha, Joel 
Hirschhorn and Michael Lloyd and performed by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson. 
It will be released soon as a cassette single, with a possible video to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The "All Dogs" sound track also boasts songs performed by Melba Moore, who does 
the voice for the whippet Angel in the film, and Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, 
the voices of Charlie and his dachshund pal Itchy. The score is by Ralph Burns, 
whose past credits include orchestrations for "Cabaret" and "All That Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's sound track for 'The Little Mermaid" features seven new songs by 
Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who wrote the songs for "The Little Shop of 
Horrors." More than 500,000 copies of the "Mermaid" sound track are being 
shipped by Disney Records, said Disney vice president Shelley Miles. The 
"Mermaid" album is being distributed not only through record stores but through 
a variety of other outlets including the K-mart chain. 
</P>
<P>
Disney Records is putting promotional muscle behind the album with a $1 rebate 
offer, regional radio contests and a $3.99 "digital water watch" (it has a 
liquid-filled dome with a tiny floating starfish figure inside), available only 
with proof of sound-track purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Other "All Dogs" and "Little Mermaid" promotion about to be unleashed: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Making of 'The Little Mermaid' " documentary, to be shown on The Disney 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
* "All Dogs Go to Heaven" promotional events at Wendy's franchises. (More than 
two dozen costumed characters will be making the rounds of Wendy's restaurants 
throughout the country.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Little Mermaid" promotional events at the Disney theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
* A Hines pet food offer for an "All Dogs" stuffed toy. 
</P>
<P>
* "All Dogs" supermarket-based coloring contests in several regions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think families will probably go out and enjoy both movies," said marketing 
consultant Mazer. 
</P>
<P>
As for plotting promotions in competition with his old firm? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a game, really," Mazer said. "It's fun to play."

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: 'DAD,' 'IMMEDIATE FAMILY' RESEMBLE TV AT ITS WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview recently, director Amy Heckerling used Goethe's phrase, "What 
has not burst forth from your own soul will not refresh you," as she described 
her impulse to make the current hit film "Look Who's Talking." In that 
particular case, the baby's-eye-view-movie emerged after the birth of her first 
child. 
</P>
<P>
It's a heartening thing to hear, especially since it runs so entirely contrary 
to the way movies are conceived these days. As we get movies built to marketing 
department specifications, we're also seeing films that are indistinguishable 
from television -- not its high end but its dreary middle-ground. It's a 
feeling that's heightened when "Immediate Family" and "Dad" open in the same 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Not all television is constricted and prosaic; no one would say that in a 
decade that has seen Dennis Potter's imagination run to its fullest; that has 
given us such miniseries as "War and Remembrance," or "Lonesome Dove." On a 
regular basis, we have (or have had) "Murphy Brown," "Hill Street Blues," "The 
Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," "Frank's Place," "thirtysomething" and "The 
Wonder Years" to keep us absorbed on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
It still leaves too many episodic television shows that are suffocatingly 
small-minded -- in their horizons, their superficiality and their notion of 
what real life or real people are all about. What's disheartening is when 
feature films, which are supposed to have a metaphoric depth of field as well 
as a literal one, begin to take on the look and sound of the worst of this kind 
of TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad," which was originally a novel by "Birdy's" William Wharton, has been 
Simonized into screen form by a writer-director, Gary David Goldberg, whose 
success came with "Family Ties." Most of the changes he's made have been in 
planing away details that might seem peculiar or foreign to mass audiences: a 
hero, for example, who was an expatriate painter settled happily in France with 
a French wife. He's been transformed into an image that television audiences 
recognize on sight: an overstressed executive (Ted Danson) who's lost touch 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad" does contain a frightening portrayal of the sudden disintegration of 
personality that can come with age, and especially in the first section of the 
film, Jack Lemmon's Dad is flawless. But as the film builds, it builds TV-cute, 
with adorable, sketch-like solutions to Dad's problems and the kind of inane 
conclusion that ends half-hour sitcoms: over-hearty laughter by a newly unified 
family. 
</P>
<P>
At the wake that ends the film, Olympia Dukakis, Lemmon's prickly, unneighborly 
wife, puts on her dead husband's baseball cap and adopts his outgoing 
mannerisms -- as though personality traits of more than 70 years could be 
erased away. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the things that made "Dad" singular as a novel have been pared away to 
make the finished product inoffensive. With another current product, "Immediate 
Family," there was nothing in Barbara Benedek's original screenplay to pare; 
it's already perfect for the tiny screen. 
</P>
<P>
The theme should be wrenching: the childlessness of a secure mature couple, the 
unwanted pregnancy of a young teen-ager who chooses to have her baby adopted. 
But even as director Jonathan Kaplan follows both adoptive parents (Glenn Close 
and James Woods) through their demoralizing fertility procedures or over even 
more infuriating adoption hurdles, the film making seems TV-careful. You get an 
awful lot of "acting" for your money here: poses, ruefulness, smiling through 
tears. (The exception is the guileless realism of Mary Stuart Masterson's young 
mother.) 
</P>
<P>
The predictability of this screenplay is absolutely crushing. Checking out the 
adoptive family's house, the young pregnant mother says yearningly that it 
would be nice if her baby's crib was put near the window, because down in the 
yard is a tree that'll be covered with flowering blossoms in the spring. Guess 
the film's last image. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that might make this safe vehicle veer one jot away from expectation 
has been avoided. Moviegoing this routine is less than no challenge, it's 
enervating. What we really lose, as drama gets this devalued, is ambiguity, 
ellipses, poetry. 
</P>
<P>
The worst of television drama works on the principal of telling us what it's 
going to say, saying it, then telling us it has said it. The best film never 
says what it's going to show; shows it obliquely and assumes that we've been 
quick enough to pick up on it. One method is insulting, the other is 
flattering. Who wouldn't rather be flattered? 
</P>
<P>
Standard television drama moves in one straight line with nothing going on 
under that line to distract or to confuse an audience. It gives you the melody; 
it leaves out the left hand. It's constructed to survive with every plot-point 
intact in spite of side-trips to the refrigerator or friendly telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
In the race to get a story told with every possible economy, details of 
character, of period, of place are jettisoned. They don't advance the plot, 
they seem to be irrelevant; all they do is deepen and enrich the soil. They 
make characters you carry around for years afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
Think of Jane Fonda in "Klute," giving that bit of excess cat food a trial 
lick. The tennis serve of Monsieur Hulot. The silent scene in "When Harry Met 
Sally . . . ," as Meg Ryan attacks a stack of letters, popping them into the 
mail slot, one at a time, and peering into the box after each one. Ted Danson, 
as an assistant D.A. in "Body Heat," dancing all by himself in the dark on the 
end of a pier with an image of Fred Astaire in his head that he can't forget. 
Treat Williams, swinging insinuatingly on the door of his convertible as he 
tries to lure Laura Dern away from her house in "Smooth Talk." Amy Wright in 
"Accidental Tourist," filing her groceries alphabetically and, for that matter, 
that entire turtle-like clan of hers with their grand eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
Films engage us by their unexpected turns; we respond to their poetry, not 
their predictability. Look at the films turning up on some of those 
decade's-best lists: "Raging Bull," "Wings of Desire," "E.T. the Extra 
Terrestrial," "Blue Velvet," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Fanny and Alexander," 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Platoon," "Shoah," "Do the Right Thing," "Road 
Warrior," "Local Hero." In an era of encroaching timidity, you could call their 
overall motto "safety last." More power to it.

ANOTHER 'PHANTOM' MATERIALIZES; 
</P>
<P>
13 YEARS AGO, KEN HILL, RIGHT, THOUGHT THE LEROUX NOVEL WOULD MAKE A FINE PLAY; 
LITTLE DID HE KNOW WHAT A GREAT IDEA IT WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There's a new Phantom in town. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 28, Ken Hill's "The Phantom of the Opera" arrives at the Wiltern 
Theatre, a short jaunt from the Ahmanson where Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom" 
has roosted since June. Giant print ads hail the distinctions: "The original 
London stage musical" is Hill's motto. "Ours is an out-and-out comedy -- with 
the music of Donizetti, Bach and Verdi," says producer Jonathan Reinis. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, notes the Hill camp, Lloyd Webber has acknowledged that he 
got his inspiration after seeing Hill's "Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1976, I was asked to do a show for a theater in the north of England, who 
wanted something fun," said the British-born Hill, 52. "It was for their summer 
season, for people who didn't normally go to the theater. I picked up a copy of 
(Gaston Leroux's novel) and read it for the first time. I had no idea it 
existed. I'd never even see the old Claude Rains movie. But I knew there was a 
great story there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much the story of the Phantom himself," he stressed. "Mostly it's 
the effect the Phantom is having on these respectable, boring people who're 
trying to run an opera house -- and there's a lunatic hiding out in the 
building. I saw the real comic potential in that." 
</P>
<P>
In his original staging, Hill utilized the score of a composer he was working 
with then. That has since been replaced with the music of Mozart, Weber and 
Offenbach. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, opera buffs will know all this material," noted Hill. "They usually 
quite enjoy the show. You see, we poke a little fun at opera and opera singers 
-- because opera, like any art form, can get rather pompous. So we have a 
theater manager, a secretary, a fat opera tenor, a diva who throws her weight 
around, a pretty little ballerina who's always flitting in and out. . . ." The 
accompaniment includes keyboards, percussion, bass, cello, French horn and 
oboe. "It's a very nice sound," Hill says. "Rather unobtrusive and gentle." 
</P>
<P>
After "Phantom's" provincial run (Hill reports rave reviews -- "but not by any 
of the major critics, because they don't travel"), he revived the work in a 
London theater in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The London production was seen by Lloyd Webber and his producer Cameron 
Mackintosh -- who then offered to produce Hill's revised staging in the West 
End. A few weeks later, Mackintosh called to notify Hill that Lloyd Webber had 
decided to write his own "Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hill, "In hindsight, I'm very relieved. They wanted it to be a big show. 
And mine's a comedy thriller, a small show. Therefore, I still have it exactly 
as I feel it should be." 
</P>
<P>
No feelings of encroachment? Hill shook his head wearily. "You have to 
understand -- I've said this over and over again -- I really don't feel that 
strongly about Andrew's decision to go off and do his own show. I'm not a 
friend of Andrew's, but I know him well enough to know the sort of person he 
is. I actually quite like Andrew. And Cameron's fine. He doesn't care about 
this production. I've gotten letters from him saying good luck and that sort of 
thing; there's plenty of room for both our shows." 
</P>
<P>
And how does Lloyd Webber feel? 
</P>
<P>
"Andrew's another matter," he sighed, "because his ego is involved. Obviously, 
he doesn't like it to be said that if it wasn't for me, his ("Phantom") 
wouldn't exist -- that this is where the idea came from. So he's careful to 
avoid any mention of it." 
</P>
<P>
Hill paused. "No, I haven't seen his show. Why should I? He's never sent me a 
ticket. I cannot comment on it because I haven't seen it. Perhaps it's better 
for me not to have seen it." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Lots and lots of reasons. For one, I might be tempted to make some 
changes in my show, mightn't I? And since I haven't seen it, I also cannot 
comment on anything else, like . . . similarities." 
</P>
<P>
He stopped, silently regarding the tape recorder. "I have to be careful what I 
say. I cannot afford to say anything inadvertently which would get me sued. 
Look, everyone has a private face and a public face. Andrew's public face is 
that he doesn't like any kind of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"He was perfectly entitled to go off and write his own 'Phantom,' " Hill 
repeated. "He's not done anything improper or illegal at all." He clears his 
throat. Subject closed. 
</P>
<P>
Director Peter Farago staged Hill's work in St. Louis in 1986 and in San 
Francisco in 1988, but Hill disassociates himself from those stagings. "This 
time I wanted to direct it myself and make it a more classy venture. I wanted 
to take out the broadness and campery that had crept into it. You see, it's not 
a huge musical. It's small in dimension. Small in the number of people on 
stage. Small in force. Fourteen actors, two understudies and six musicians. In 
England, it's what we'd call a play with songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reproducing an old production," Hill noted of his current duties. 
"Nevertheless, I'm having to do it for America -- and there are differences. 
The text changes are small, just odd words that Americans don't use or 
understand. My main problem is that it's a comedy, and English comedy doesn't 
always travel well. Back home the graveyards are littered with the bones of 
English comedians who've died in America. So there are little moments in the 
play where the humor still needs work, to make it accessible to American 
audiences." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reception has been warm. 
</P>
<P>
"I purchased the North American rights, mounted it at my Theatre on the Square 
in San Francisco in 1988 and it ran for 10 months," said producer Reinis. "Over 
200,000 people saw it. It grossed in excess of $3.4 million. Then I licensed 
the show to a national touring promoter, Electric Factory Concerts in 
Philadelphia." Electric's Allen Spivak has since overseen the play's 35-city 
trek. Variety reported last week that the tour recouped its $1 million cost 
after only eight weeks on the road. The show will travel to Symphony Hall in 
San Diego from Dec. 19-31. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the tour, reports surfaced of audience confusion over which 
"Phantom" they were seeing. Last June, Spivak and partner Larry Magid filed 
federal lawsuits in Georgia and Ohio alleging that local promoters were 
impeding their booking efforts. "The (Atlanta) paper ran the wrong ad, which 
didn't have the disclaimer where we clearly say who we are," Spivak explained 
curtly. "So we did have a little confusion. But there's been no problem since 
then, a minor amount of refunds. And there's no current litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Hill himself is visibly uncomfortable at the idea that audiences would attend 
his show by mistake. "I'm very anxious that that should not happen," he said 
soberly. "Because if they come with the wrong expectations -- expecting a 
spectacular, then not getting one -- we're in trouble, no matter how 
entertaining the play is. But you know, I don't care about standing up to 
Andrew. My work's all right. I know exactly where the play is, how good it is. 
It has good standards. It's very well done." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he admitted, the David and Goliath metaphor hasn't been that far off the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a period when it was very difficult to get dates. People said, 'Yes, 
we'll take it,' then changed their minds. A theater manager doesn't know the 
history of our show. For all he knows, we're just some cheap-jack merchants 
hanging on Andrew's coat-tails and trying to make some quick bucks. So 
naturally we've been treated with some suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
Hill's producers flatly deny the charge of riding on anybody's coat-tails. "I 
prefer to say it's a case of an author getting his just deserts," Reinis 
stated. "If Webber and Mackintosh hadn't changed their minds, my 'Phantom' 
would've been their 'Phantom.' So maybe it's a question of the tail wagging the 
dog. There's a certain amoung of justice to it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Spivak, "I knew it was going to be a success, and I've been proven right. 
Now we're in a 'Phantom'-mania; everybody's jumping on the bandwagon. It's nice 
to know we called the shots early on." Spivak is right about one thing: "The 
Phantom" is a hot ticket. In addition to the current "Phantom of the Opera" 
film (with "Nightmare on Elm Street's" Robert Englund), a TV miniseries version 
with Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance is upcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Hill himself is justifiably weary of all the "Phantom" hoopla; after he puts 
some finishing touches on the Los Angeles staging, the 30-year theater veteran 
heads back to his London base. "I've had eight weeks of hotel rooms," he said 
dryly. "I just want to go home." And back to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Either I'm writing or directing -- or both," he said genially. "That's all I 
do. Year in and year out. I never get a holiday. Actually, I've been very 
lucky. I'm one of the few people in England who earns his living just being a 
writer in the theater. Though I've never made it big, I've never been out of 
work either -- because my work does tend to be very popular." 
</P>
<P>
And when, on rare occasion, it isn't? Look I've done between 100 to 200 plays," 
he said briskly. "When you have that many first nights, you're going to get 
slighted from time to time. The thing is, I have a very thick skin. I have to, 
you see. If you write and direct a show and the critics don't like it, they 
throw the bricks at me. If they like it, they praise the cast. I'm telling you 
I can't win. I'm also telling you I don't care, because it's been going on so 
long."

A FASCINATING COMPARISON: TWO 'CARMENS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER PRICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bizet: "Carmen." Jessye Norman, Neil Shicoff, Mirella Freni, Simon Estes. 
Chorus of France, Orchestre National, Seiji Ozawa conducting. Philips 422 336-1 
(3 compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
Bizet: "Carmen." Rise Stevens, Jan Peerce, Licia Albanese, Robert Merrill. 
Robert Shaw Chorale, RCA Victor Orchestra, Fritz Reiner conducting. BMG 
Classics 7981-2-RG (3 compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
The release of Philip's new "Carmen," following the reissue of the classic RCA 
version made nearly 40 years ago, makes a fascinating comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a disastrous opera debut at La Scala in a 1979 "Tosca," Ozawa continues 
to nurture his conceit that he is a proper conductor for musical theater. His 
work here verges on travesty. Whether the ludicrously slow tempi for such set 
pieces as the Habanera and Gypsy Song are his idea or that of his 
soprano-mezzo-alto (who-knows?) protagonist is open to question, but he must 
take full responsibility for the perverse distortion in the Act II finale, to 
name only one shocker. The performance is rhythmically flaccid and dramatically 
tepid. 
</P>
<P>
Norman just might make a decent Carmen for discs (considering the physique that 
nature has given her, we are unlikely to experience it in the theater) if she 
collaborated with a knowing conductor. Her work here, however, is precious, 
fussy and ultimately vulgar. Shicoff offers a whining, tired sounding Jose, 
while Estes' Toreador is merely ugly. Freni's once-lustrous soprano now sounds 
effortful and wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
This version drops the Guiraud recitatives (which RCA uses) and restores some 
of the spoken dialogue -- a small bonus given polyglot accents that might cause 
De Gaulle to rise in wrath from his grave. If they should award a Grammy for 
High Camp Party Record of the Year, this recording is a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Reiner "Carmen" is remarkable for its grand line, its 
easy lyricism flowing into taut drama seamlessly. Stevens was the Carmen of her 
day, and it is easy to hear why. Her singing is brilliantly disciplined with a 
dazzling variety of color. Above all, she gives is a convincing 
characterization throughout, with a savage last act that influenced more than a 
few subsequent interpreters of the role. 
</P>
<P>
The major drawback is Peerce's tiresome, nasal Jose. Albanese's mature Micaela 
is hard-driven but still authoritative. Merrill's sterling baritone is heard 
here in his best part, his dubious French accent notwithstanding. The ensemble 
impact is enhanced by the fact that most of the singers, including the 
marvelous supporting cast, had sung many performances together at the 
Metropolitan (only Peerce had not done his part on stage).

Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) urged former Housing Secretary Samuel R. 
Pierce Jr. to approve a multimillion-dollar grant for a renovation project 
operated in part by two of the senator's supporters, the New York Times 
reported. In a March 15, 1984, letter, D'Amato asked Pierce to use "deliberate 
speed" in approving the 65-unit Buffalo project, which was approved within two 
months, the newspaper said. The letter appears to contradict the senator's 
repeated assertions that he never asked HUD officials to approve specific 
moderate-rehabilitation projects, the Times said.

Chanting "liberty for Dr. Bosch" and waving Cuban flags, about 1,000 Cuban 
exiles marched through Miami's Little Havana section to call on the U.S. 
government to release jailed anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch and end its 
efforts to deport him. Bosch has been branded a terrorist by the Justice 
Department but is hailed as an anti-communist hero by many Cuban exiles. Since 
his deportation from Venezuela in 1988 he has been in jail in Miami on a parole 
violation on a conviction for firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in the 
Port of Miami.

About 2,000 people marched through Laguna Canyon to protest a proposed project 
that would bring 3,000 new homes and a golf course to the rustic area. The 
Irvine Co.'s Laguna Laurel project -- a proposed 3,000-home residential 
community and golf course surrounding three lakes -- "would forever change this 
pristine site," endangering unique plant and animal habitats, said Henry 
Huggins, a march coordinator. The project has been approved by county 
supervisors but construction has not begun.

DUCKS HAND BRUINS FIFTH STRAIGHT DEFEAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Third-quarter interceptions by Derek Horton and Daryl Reed set up Oregon 
touchdowns Saturday as the Ducks rallied for a 38-20 Pacific 10 Conference 
victory over slumping UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the fifth in a row for the Bruins, their longest losing streak 
since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is 2-5 in Pac-10 play and 3-7 overall. The Bruins haven't lost seven games 
in a season since 1971 when they were 2-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon went ahead 21-20 on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Bill Musgrave to Tony 
Hargain with 8:25 left in the third quarter and stayed on top the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Loville, who led all rushers with 119 yards on 28 carries, scored on a 
2-yard run with 14:05 left in the game, making it 28-20. The Ducks moved 39 
yards on eight plays after Reed's 17-yard intercepton return. 
</P>
<P>
A 47-yard field goal by Gregg McCallum with 5:58 remaining and a 29-yard run by 
Latin Berry with 25 seconds left completed the scoring. Oregon outscored UCLA 
28-0 in the second half.

BO KNOWS ROSE BOWL, BUT ILLINI DON'T, 24-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As usual, everything is coming up Roses for Michigan, which shouldn't surprise 
anyone. After all, Bo knows the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan disposed of Illinois, 24-10, Saturday at Memorial Stadium, and while 
it didn't clinch another trip to Pasadena, it helped. A lot. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't win this game, we're not going to win the championship, we're not 
going to the Rose Bowl and we're not going to get the things we want," Michigan 
Coach Bo Schembechler said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Illinois Coach John Mackovic: "This was not a regular game, this was a 
big game." 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Now, rather than depend on the kindness of strangers, third-ranked Michigan 
(8-1) will determine its own postseason travel plans. Beat Minnesota and Ohio 
State, and Schembechler returns to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
It will be nice to see him again, considering his conduct on the sideline 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler sent what looked like a clipboard to an early death when 
quarterback Michael Taylor stumbled on a third-down play late in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler steamed when his Wolverines had eight penalty flags thrown their 
way during the course of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And Schembechler, who has undergone two heart operations, surely must have sent 
his cardiologist rushing for Valium because of the way the coach took exception 
to a referee's call late in the third quarter. Suffice it to say that 
Schembechler's sideline vocabulary was probably as blue as the Michigan 
baseball cap he wore. 
</P>
<P>
What he should have done was sit back and enjoy a Michigan victory over 
eighth-ranked Illinois (8-2) that featured all the normal Wolverine 
ingredients: a running game that eats up opponents and the clock; and a defense 
that manages to confound, though, no one is quite sure how. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up 10 points and yardage galore in the first half, the Wolverines 
put a choke hold on Illinois quarterback Jeff George and the Fighting Illini's 
high-tech offense. George finished with 253 yards on 22 of 38 pass attempts, 
but he didn't throw a touchdown, which was something of shocker given 
Michigan's somewhat suspect pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were there any fourth-quarter heroics, a George staple these days. Instead, 
George completed only three of seven passes in the final period, four if you 
count the interception he threw to Michigan strong safety Tripp Welborne with 
2:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start, they were sitting back in zones and we pretty much did what we 
wanted to," George said. ". . . They had to change something." 
</P>
<P>
They did, but Schembechler wasn't in the mood to disclose any state secrets: 
</P>
<P>
"We made a few adjustments, but nothing I can tell you that will make for 
exciting reading." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, the Wolverines were worried about George. He spent nearly the 
entire first half standing . . . and standing . . . and standing in the passing 
pocket, waiting seemingly forever for his receivers to find openings. Pressure 
was applied only on occasion by a Michigan defense that appeared more concerned 
with not allowing a long completion. 
</P>
<P>
That explained why George was able to answer almost every Michigan first-half 
score with an Illinois score of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michigan tailback Tony Boles broke loose for a 73-yard run on the second 
play of the game. ("I found a crease, and there I went," Boles said.) Jarrod 
Bunch scored a play later. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. George led Illinois on an 85-yard touchdown drive on its first 
possession, tying the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michigan's J.D. Carlson kicked a 47-yard field goal with 2:02 remaining in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
George completed a 41-yard pass play to wide receiver Mike Bellamy on the next 
possession. The Illini's Doug Higgins went on to kick a field goal of 25 yards 
to tie the game again. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Wolverines took a 17-10 halftime lead on a two-yard touchdown run 
by Taylor with 4:34 left in the second quarter, Illinois couldn't have been too 
worried. The Illini had blown several scoring opportunities, but there wasn't 
any reason to think similar chances wouldn't be available in the final two 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan certainly wouldn't have argued with the theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a long second half," Michigan free safety Vada 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
It was -- for Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the Illini would receive only one other real chance to beat 
the Wolverines. It came with 4:30 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With fourth-and-one on the Michigan four and trailing, 17-10, Mackovic decided 
to go for the first down. George took the snap, dropped back and threw wildly 
in the general direction of tight end Don Donovan. Murray was there to knock 
the pass down. 
</P>
<P>
An inventive play, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"The tight end ran right into me," Murray said. "If you don't know it's a pass 
then, you shouldn't be playing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schembechler: "On third and fourth downs, that guy George is the most 
dangerous guy they have on the team. If that quarterback is on my team, I 
wouldn't second-guess that play at all." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler might have been an extra bit forgiving. Mackovic is a close 
friend. Schembechler gave him his first coaching job way back when. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Michigan won. 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of the game, it was vintage Michigan, with time-consuming 
drives over land. Boles finished with 115 yards. Taylor had 65 yards. Bunch had 
66. 
</P>
<P>
No Illinois player rushed for more than 47 yards.

"We controlled the game pretty much," Boles said. "I knew if our defense 
stopped (George), we could win the ballgame."

UCLA FALTERS AGAIN IN SECOND HALF, 38-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
UCLA, self-destruction be thy middle name. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a six-point halftime advantage Saturday and playing so well that they 
had not punted, the Bruins started the second half with possessions that 
resulted in a blocked field goal attempt and two interceptions. There also was 
an offensive pass-interference penalty (away from the ball) that negated a 
72-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon (6-4) took advantage of both interceptions, converting them into 
touchdowns that propelled the Ducks to a 38-20 victory over the Bruins before 
46,433 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And so, for the first time in 26 years, UCLA has lost five consecutive games in 
one season. The Bruins, shut out in the second half for the second week in a 
row, are 3-7 and assured of their worst season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Can it get any worse? 
</P>
<P>
Well, up next is USC Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a really bad second half," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "We've 
done that on several occasions this season. I don't know if we just run out of 
gas or we don't have the ability to play consecutive good halves of football. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half, I thought we played like crazy -- (on) both sides of the ball. 
We did a great job. The second half, we were really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Both interceptions were thrown by freshman quarterback Bret Johnson, who was 
supposed to share time with sophomore Jim Bonds, but kept Bonds on the sideline 
with a brilliant first half, completing 10 of 11 passes for 119 yards and 
leading four scoring drives to help UCLA to a 20-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's string of nine completions ended on the first possession of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Split end Mike Farr ran for 24 yards on a reverse on that possession, moving 
UCLA to Oregon's 26. Farr's run was the Bruins' longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson then threw three incomplete passes, including one into the end zone 
that was tipped away by free safety Derek Horton, who would haunt Johnson again 
a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Velasco, whose first-half field goals of 26 and 35 yards were the 
difference to that point, was brought on for a 44-yard attempt that never made 
it past the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Chris Oldham sprinted around wingback Corwin Anthony, who was lined 
up on the right side, and batted down the kick. Anthony, lined up last week on 
the left side, was beaten by Stanford's Kevin Scott, who blocked a 37-yard 
attempt by Velasco in the third quarter of a 17-14 Cardinal win. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't go out and get field goals blocked," Donahue said. "It's just 
not acceptable. You've got to have people who can 'double-bump,' and we don't 
have anybody in our program with the ability to do that, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's first possession of the half went three plays and out, but Johnson 
then sailed a pass over the head of tight end Charles Arbuckle and into the 
waiting arms of an appreciative Horton, who returned the interception 34 yards 
to UCLA's 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"Our corner, Chris Oldham, got inside of his man and forced the quarterback to 
throw it high," Horton said. "I just happened to be in my deep zone and the 
ball came right to me." 
</P>
<P>
Horton said he lost it in the lights for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously. 
</P>
<P>
He called it a good pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody said on the sidelines that (Arbuckle) was held," Johnson said. "He 
probably wouldn't have been able to make the catch, but he probably would have 
been able to break up the interception." 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Oregon moved ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Split end Tony Hargain scored the go-ahead touchdown, working himself free in 
the middle of the end zone and taking a nine-yard pass from quarterback Bill 
Musgrave to give the Ducks a 21-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really bad play," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next, in Donahue's opinion, was a really bad call, which he made 
clear to referee Gordon Riese in no uncertain terms. 
</P>
<P>
Farr, running an out pattern, took a pass from Johnson in front of the UCLA 
bench, made a quick pivot to shake cornerback Daryl Reed and took off down the 
sideline, outsprinting Reed into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-yard play would have given UCLA the lead, but tight end Randy Austin was 
called for pass interference away from the play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on the same side of the field as the reception," Riese said of Austin's 
infraction, which was detected not by Riese, but by another official whom Riese 
declined to name. "The offensive man can't go downfield and block the man if 
the ball crosses the line of scrimmage. If we think the foul has bearing on the 
play, we call the penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that Austin was not blocking on the play, but rather trying to 
break loose from two defenders to run a pass route. 
</P>
<P>
The official's ruling, he said, was the play of the game. But, while he 
obviously disagreed with it, he declined to discuss it specifically. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not allowed to comment on the pass-interference call, which is a 
tremendous frustration for me," he said. "I really wish I could. I'd give you 
an earful. I'd be on the Jim Healy show." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's fourth possession of the half resulted in another interception on 
another overthrown pass by Johnson, who stepped up into the pocket and rifled a 
high throw that bounced the hands of a leaping Scott Miller and into the hands 
of Reed, who returned the interception 17 yards to UCLA's 39-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"I just delivered the ball a little too high," said Johnson, who was lifted in 
favor of Bonds when UCLA got the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Oregon's lead had grown to 28-20. 
</P>
<P>
A sack of Musgrave by linebacker Marvcus Patton forced Oregon into a 
third-and-19 situation at the UCLA 48, but Musgrave found Hargain in the middle 
of the Bruin secondary and completed a 23-yard pass to his split end. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to drop it into Hargain," Musgrave said. "He jumps really well. I 
knew he'd go up and get it." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks ran it in from the Bruins' 25. Tailback Derek Loville, who carried 28 
times for 119 yards, scored on a two-yard run through the left side to give the 
Ducks an eight-point lead with 14:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
That might not sound like much, but in the second half of their last five 
games, the Bruins have produced only two touchdowns and three field goals, none 
of them in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon held the UCLA offense in check and added a 47-yard field goal by Gregg 
McCallum and a 29-yard touchdown run by Latin Berry in the last 5:58. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make any changes," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said of the Ducks' 
second-half dominance. "We just tried to get a little bit fired up on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we were soft in the first half. We talked about it at halftime and 
decided we were going to make a better effort." 
</P>
<P>
Against UCLA these days, that's about all it takes.

JIM MURRAY: ONE'S VANTAGE POINT AFFECTS BASEBALL LORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was Kirk Gibson's "Roy Hobbs" homer in the bottom of the ninth for the Dodgers 
in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series the Greatest Moment in Baseball History? 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Babe Ruth "calling his shot" in the '32 classic? Maybe it was Bobby 
Thomson's pennant-winning blow for the New York Giants in the '51 playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you like pitching. How about Johnny Vander Meer's back-to-back no-hitters 
for Cincinnati in '38? Don't wait up to see that again. 
</P>
<P>
They're having a banquet in New York Monday night to determine which of 20 
highlight moments in baseball is the game's all-time thriller. The credit card 
company, MasterCard, polled fans and sportswriters for a promotion in which the 
proceeds will go to combat ALS, the disease that cut short the life of Lou 
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion is all right so far as it goes. But it deals in happy moments, 
save for Gehrig's farewell ceremony at Yankee Stadium in '39. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you and I know baseball isn't all moonlight and roses, right? Baseball is 
suffering. Every home fan knows that. Consider the most famous piece of 
baseball literature of all time, "Casey at the Bat." Is that about the pitcher 
who struck him out? Is there one mention about the team that won? No, we are 
concerned here only with the fact there is no joy in Mudville. Never mind where 
there is joy. 
</P>
<P>
Take the game's anthem: "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." What's the key line? 
"If they don't win it's a shame." The guy who wrote that knew baseball. 
</P>
<P>
So, I wouldn't consider most of MasterCard's list as representative of the 
grand old game as you and I know it. I would prefer an alternate list. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
1. You say you saw Koufax pitch? Well, I saw Koufax bat. Never mind the four 
no-hitters, the strikeouts, the shutouts. The definitive memory I have of Sandy 
Koufax is in 1962 when he hit a home run off -- get this -- Warren Spahn! Now, 
Sandy was a lifetime .097 hitter with the Dodgers (he hit over .100 only once 
in his career, .177) and when he hit that home run, Spahnie chased him around 
the bases with cords standing out in his neck, calling Sandy every name he 
could think of (and, with Spahn, there were a lot of them). As Sandy rounded 
third that day, Milwaukee's Eddie Mathews growled, "You're making a sick joke 
out of this game!" A Koufax homer off Warren Spahn makes my highlight list 
hands down. 
</P>
<P>
2. You can talk of Carl Hubbell's five Hall of Famer strikeouts in an All-Star 
game, but how about Stan Williams walking in the 1962 pennant for the Giants? 
How about Manager Walt Alston ordering an intentional base on balls to the 
previous batter (Ed Bailey) to load the bases and set up the tragedy? The 
circumstances were these: The Dodgers carried a 4-2 lead into the final inning 
of the playoffs. As the disastrous inning unfolded, the Giants tied the score 
and had the bases loaded with two out when Williams walked Jim Davenport. Run 
up the pennant for San Francisco. The fateful inning saw the Dodgers 
contributing four bases on balls, an error and a wild pitch. The Giants got 
four runs -- and a pennant -- on two hits, including one in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
3. You can home in on Bill Mazeroski's home run in the bottom of the ninth that 
won the 1960 World Series over the New York Yankees, if you like. But come with 
me to the eighth inning of that game. The Yankees were leading, 7-4, as 
Pittsburgh came to bat. Gino Cimoli singled to open the inning. Then came the 
routine double-play ball that probably decided the Series. It was what Joe 
Garagiola would describe as "a room-service double play." Except that the ball, 
off the bat of Bill Virdon, hit the infamous surface of Forbes Field's infield, 
known throughout the National League as "the coal mine." It bounced off an 
outcropping of anthracite, came up and hit Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the 
throat. It almost cost him his voice. It cost his team the World Series. A 
short time later, a backup catcher, Hal Smith, hit a home run with two on to 
put the Pirates ahead, 9-7. He never would have gotten to bat if the ball to 
Kubek hadn't found a rock. Mazeroski's homer in the ninth would have been 
merely interesting. 
</P>
<P>
4. Some people gave some consideration to the comeback of the New York Mets in 
Game 6 of the 1986 World Series as the definitive one, and that would make our 
pantheon, too, because of the ball that trickled through Red Sox first baseman 
Bill Buckner's legs. But our vote would have gone to the 10-run seventh inning 
posted by the Philadelphia Athletics over the Chicago Cubs at Philadelphia in 
1929. Not for the comeback, for the collapse. The Cubs had an 8-0 lead at the 
time. What mades this collapse memorable was that the Chicago center fielder, 
Hack Wilson, misjudged two fly balls in the inning. One of them went for an 
inside-the-park home run and scored three runs before he could run it down. 
Now, Slugger Hack was as famous for rum as runs. With runs, he either drove 
them in -- or let them in. In this inning, he let in five runs. Years later, 
teammate Pat Malone put the right note on it: "Hack did all right for a guy who 
saw three balls." 
</P>
<P>
5. One of the early eliminations in the balloting (62 moments were originally 
cited, then culled to 20) was a relief-pitching stint of 17 innings by Ed 
Rommel of the Athletics in 1932. It was not exactly Goose Gossage stuff. Eddie 
gave up 29 hits (and 14 runs) in that stint. He gave up eight hits to one 
batter alone, Cleveland shortstop Johnny Burnett, who set a major league record 
of nine hits in a game that day. That's one game I wish I'd seen. 
</P>
<P>
6. You can cite Nolan Ryan's five no-hitters, Koufax's four or Vander Meer's 
two straight, but let's have a moment of silence for Harvey Haddix, who pitched 
the longest no-hitter in baseball history. And lost. He pitched a perfect game 
for 12 innings for Pittsburgh against Milwaukee in 1959. His opponent, Lew 
Burdette, had a 12-hitter. Haddix lost the perfect game to an error and the 
no-hitter (and the game) to a home run in the bottom of the 13th. Actually, he 
almost didn't lose the game. When Joe Adcock hit the bottom-of-the-13th home 
run, there was one out and teammates Henry Aaron and Felix Mantilla on first 
and second. When the home run cleared the fence, Aaron cut for the dugout at 
second base instead of continuing on to the plate. Adcock was declared out for 
passing him. Mantilla was called back on the field to score. Had there been two 
out, the game might have gone on. The final score went into the record book as 
1-0. Haddix lost his no-hitter, Adcock lost his home run and baseball lost a 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
You see, baseball is not all ticker-tape parades to City Hall. Baseball is 
about losing. The poet, Aeneas, wrote about "the sense of tears in mortal 
things." Baseball fans know where he's coming from. You're not a fan till your 
favorite pitcher walks in the winning run, your favorite hitter pops up with 
the bases loaded, your favorite team blows an 8-0 lead in the eighth inning. 
That's when baseball finds out who its friends are. Those are the real 
highlights. The might-have-beens.

THE OTHER GAMES

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (4-5) at Buffalo (6-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich played well in Jim Kelly's absence, but Kelly returned to the 
Buffalo lineup and rallied the Bills three times last week at Atlanta before 
coming up short. Eric Dickerson, out with a hamstring injury in last week's 
loss to Miami, is expected back. Tom Ramsey will replace Colt quarterback Jack 
Trudeau, who has a broken finger on his left hand. The Colts trounced the 
Bills, 37-14, five weeks ago, and the teams split their series last season. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (5-4) at Pittsburgh (4-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears have lost four of five. The offense has been a primary culprit, 
scoring only 40 points in three games, with neither Mike Tomczak nor Jim 
Harbaugh able to make the big plays at quarterback. The Steelers will have to 
keep Richard Dent off Bubby Brister, who hasn't had a pass intercepted in his 
last 179 attempts. The Bears haven't won at Pittsburgh since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (4-5) at New England (3-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The surging Saints were beaten by San Francisco Monday night, ending a 
three-game winning streak, but New Orleans has the No. 1 defense and has moved 
the ball with Bobby Hebert and Dalton Hilliard. The Patriots have lost twice 
recently on last-minute field goals. Former Raider Marc Wilson replaced injured 
Steve Grogan last week and could become the Patriots' fourth starting 
quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Denver (7-2) at Kansas City (4-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
By mortal standards, John Elway is struggling, but he's done enough positive 
things to keep the Broncos winning. Denver has beaten the Chiefs in seven of 
their last nine games, but Kansas City's two victories came at Arrowhead 
Stadium. Kansas City has regained respect by giving the ball to Christian Okoye 
and playing tough defense. The Broncos beat the Chiefs in the season opener, 
34-20, and the teams split two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (6-3) at Seattle (4-5), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, AFC West champions last season, are fighting to stay in the 
playoff race. Usually strong at home, the Seahawks are 1-3 at Seattle this 
season. The Browns, one game ahead of Cincinnati and Houston in the AFC 
Central, are getting enough running from Eric Metcalf to make it easier on 
Bernie Kosar. The Seahawks have been unable to run consistently, and 
quarterback Dave Krieg has felt the pressure. He was sacked five times and 
fumbled six times last week. Seattle beat the Browns, 16-10, last season at 
Cleveland. The Seahawks lead the series, 8-2, but both Brown wins have come in 
the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (5-4) at New York Jets (2-7), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Sammie Smith has given the Dolphins the running game they need to take 
the pressure off quarterback Dan Marino. Last week's victory at Indianapolis 
put Miami one game behind AFC East-leading Buffalo. Ken O'Brien and the New 
York offense came alive last week as the Jets beat New England. The Jets have 
beaten the Dolphins in four of their last five games, including a 40-33 victory 
seven weeks ago, and swept the two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay (5-4) at Detroit (1-8), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
This is another big step in the Packer resurgence because Green Bay is 0-3 on 
the road. It could be an offensive show with Detroit rookies Rodney Peete and 
Barry Sanders against the Packers' Don Majkowski, who leads the NFL in passing 
with 2,602 yards and 18 touchdowns. Green Bay beat the Lions, 23-20, in 
overtime two weeks ago and has won three of the last four games at the 
Silverdome. The Lions swept the two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (6-3) at Tampa Bay (3-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In his return as starting quarterback, Wade Wilson couldn't get the Vikings a 
touchdown but got them close enough for Rich Karlis to kick seven field goals 
in a victory over the Rams. Vinny Testaverde, who had four more passes 
intercepted last week, has led Tampa Bay to big numbers, but the defense has 
given up even bigger numbers in four consecutive defeats. Minnesota beat the 
Buccaneers, 17-3, six weeks ago and has beaten Tampa Bay in nine of the last 10 
games, including a two-game sweep last season. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (4-5) at Philadelphia (6-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two teams coming off real downers. The Eagles had a four-game winning streak 
end with a 20-17 setback at San Diego. Washington became Dallas' first victim, 
13-3. Doug Williams will remain at quarterback for the Redskins despite the 
rust he showed in his first game of the season, but he has three starters 
missing from his offensive line. The Redskins have lost to the Eagles only four 
times since 1981, but Philadelphia rallied from a 20-0 deficit for a 42-37 
victory in the second game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (1-8) at Phoenix (4-5), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer has sparked the Cowboys recently; he had 110 rushing yards in 
Dallas' victory a week ago. Troy Aikman will start in place of struggling Steve 
Walsh at quarterback for the Cowboys. Cardinal quarterback Gary Hogeboom is 
having his troubles, reportedly because of an arthritic elbow in his throwing 
arm. He has lost J.T. Smith, the NFL's leading receiver with 62 catches, with a 
broken leg. The Cardinals beat the Cowboys, 19-10, two weeks ago and can sweep 
the series for the first time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (3-6) at San Francisco (8-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana showed no ill-effects from a three-week layoff in leading the 49ers 
past New Orleans, but he has Jerry Rice, Roger Craig and friends to work with. 
Atlanta's Chris Miller is one of the league's better quarterbacks, but doesn't 
have nearly the supporting cast. Miller hasn't had a pass intercepted in six 
games. The Falcons have beaten the 49ers once in their last 10 meetings, last 
season at Candlestick Park. The Falcons are 0-5 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (5-4) at Houston (5-4) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The extra day off may give Boomer Esiason's bruised lung time to heal. 
Otherwise, Bengal quarterback Erik Wilhelm, a rookie, will make his first NFL 
start. Cincinnati, already without Ickey Woods for the season, also had backs 
James Brooks and Eric Ball injured last week against the Raiders. Warren Moon 
of the Oilers has passed for 2,255 yards and 14 touchdowns. Houston has beaten 
the Bengals four consecutive times in the Astrodome.

CLIPPER COMEBACK FIZZLES AT BUZZER; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT IN SECOND HALF UNTIL KNICKS' 
WILKINS SLIPS IN FOR GAME-WINNING TIP-IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Clippers thought they felt bad after back-to-back blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
Then came this. 
</P>
<P>
A comeback from a 14-point deficit in the second quarter that turned into a 
one-point lead with 5.7 seconds to play ended as a heart-breaking 112-111 loss 
to the New York Knicks Saturday night before 12,116 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat came even though Knick Rod Strickland missed two free throws with 
2.5 seconds left and the Clippers leading, 111-110. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins, Strickland's teammate, figured Strickland might miss his second 
attempt. He was near halfcourt for the first shot, and moved right behind the 
shooter for the second. When Strickland released the ball, Wilkins charged down 
the left side of the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland's shot hit the rim, bounced to the backboard, then to the left, and 
Wilkins was there to reach over Clipper Joe Wolf and tip in the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a great athletic play on his part," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said of 
Wilkins' maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he came from," Wolf said. "I had Eddie Lee (Wilkins) boxed 
out." 
</P>
<P>
That he did. But no one picked up Gerald Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that after he (Strickland) missed the first shot, it would be tough for 
him to make the second, with the crowd on their feet and all that," Gerald 
Wilkins said. "I ran to the top of the key. By the time the ball hit the rim, I 
was at the top of the lane. The ball flew to the left and I just went over 
(Wolf)." 
</P>
<P>
More than giving the Clippers another defeat, their third in four games, it 
meant a crushing loss. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the game," said Reggie Williams, a key part to the comeback who 
finished with 24 points, second only to Ken Norman's game-high 26. Norman made 
the go-ahead basket and subsequent free throw with 5.7 seconds left to give the 
Clippers their 111-110 lead. "One rebound away from winning the game and we let 
it slip away." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Casey apparently took this loss as hard as any during his 48-game 
tenure. He certainly was as demonstrative as ever on the sideline, and then, in 
a rare move, bolted from the locker room after a quick statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes to show you that hustle and effort are one thing . . . but 
intelligence is another," he said. "We told the guys not to foul, and then we 
did not block out." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant's foul, after Norman had put the Clippers ahead, set up the 
Strickland/Wilkins play. A series of events necessitated the furious charge to 
get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith's return from a strained hip muscle was, if nothing else, an 
emotional pregame boost to a team badly in need of one. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers lost the two outings he missed by a combined 48 points, and 
Dallas, in the last game, exposed the weakness of depth on the front line. With 
Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley, the Knicks had the potential to cause similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But with Williams as aggressive on the boards as any Knick, size was not the 
problem as the Clippers fell behind by 14 early in the second quarter. It was 
Los Angeles hitting nine of 28 shots (32%) in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers cut the deficit to eight on two occasions in the second quarter 
before going into halftime trailing by 10, 62-52. Norman scored 10 of their 
final 12 points, en route to 15 at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing also had 15 for the Knicks, along with nine rebounds, and he would finish 
with 20 and 11, respectively. New York (3-2) shot 55% in the first half, 
compared to 37% for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Then they came out of the locker room like a different team. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Clipper rallies, defense was the catalyst -- the Knicks were held to 
seven points in the opening 4:15 of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, the Clippers didn't miss when they had the chances -- they 
scored on 10 of their first 11 second-half trips down court. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with seven minutes to play in the quarter, they went ahead, 72-71, as 
Grant scored on a back-door layup. New York got the lead back temporarily, but 
the Clippers responded again, going up, 84-77, with 1:45 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't getting blown out for a change, but that merely set them up for 
another kind of agony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Garrick will be examined today to determine the extent of his injured right 
knee, now being termed a sprain but possibly worse. "It could be as serious as 
a torn cartilage," trainer Bernie LaReau said. "But we're hoping it's just that 
(sprained). We're hoping it's just a bruise that is causing inflammation in the 
joint." Garrick, backup to Gary Grant at point guard, suffered the injury when 
he bumped into Jeff Martin in practice Monday and re-injured it during 
Wednesday's loss to Dallas. Andre Turner, signed off waivers from Charlotte the 
day before the season, should get additional playing time in Garrick's absence. 
. . . New York forward Kiki Vandeweghe, still living in Southern California, 
attended the game but set no time table for a return from chronic back 
problems. The former UCLA star missed most of training camp and has yet to play 
in a game this season.

<P>
Opponent -- Dallas Mavericks.

<P>
Site -- at Forum.

<P>
Time -- 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Records -- Lakers 4-1; Mavericks 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Record vs. Mavericks -- 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Laker update -- James Worthy played 44 of the 48 minutes with a sprained right 
ankle in Friday night's six-point victory over the Charlotte Hornets, so it is 
understandable that the Laker forward was held out of practice Saturday. Coach 
Pat Riley, however, said Worthy is expected to play tonight. Better medical 
news is that Byron Scott was able to play 38 and 36 minutes in back-to-back 
games and not report any discomfort in his left hamstring. The Lakers are 
shooting 44.1% and averaging 104.6 points per game, 10.1 fewer than last 
season. However, the Lakers hold a 249-223 rebounding advantage through five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Maverick update -- Dallas figures to give the Lakers problems because of the 
disparity in height. The Mavericks start 7-foot-1 James Donaldson at center, 
7-foot Roy Tarpley at power forward and bring 6-9 Sam Perkins and 6-11 Herb 
Williams off the bench. But height did not win out in the season opener, when 
the Lakers defeated (and outrebounded) the Mavericks, 102-94, at Dallas. 
Through four games -- three losses and a victory over the Clippers -- guard 
Rolando Blackman has been the leading scorer with a 19.3 average, followed by 
Adrian Dantley's 18.8 average. Tarpley is averaging 16.8 rebounds and 16.8 
points.

THOMAS, PISTONS CAN'T STAND HEAT IN 88-84 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Miami Heat is used to playing against stars, Kevin Edwards said 
it's easier to win against them. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat proved Edwards' point Saturday night at Miami with a landmark victory 
for the second-year franchise, 88-84 over the NBA champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of rookies last year and we were kind of star-struck by other 
teams," Edwards said. "This year they're just basketball players. You see a 
superstar just about every night, so you can't think about that while you're 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
Miami overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter, and Edwards scored 
nine of the Heat's final 14 points, 
</P>
<P>
Edwards hit two free throws to give Miami an 86-84 lead with 40 seconds left. 
After Isiah Thomas missed two driving shots and James Edwards missed two free 
throws for Detroit, the Heat's Grant Long clinched the victory with two free 
throws with less than one second left. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons return home after a 2-3 road trip. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and Rony Seikaly scored 21 points each to lead the Heat, whose first 
home victory of the season came six weeks earlier than last season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led the Pistons with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 104, Boston 101 -- Mark Price returned from a sprained foot and 
scored 19 points, including three three-pointers, as the Cavaliers won their 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
Price was one of three starters missing from the Cavaliers' first four game. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ehlo also scored 19 points and had three three-pointers at Richfield, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Showing few ill effects from the sprained right foot, Price scored 10 
first-half points as Cleveland overcame an early 11-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Parish led the Celtics with 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 148, Orlando 109 -- Moses Malone scored 28 points and led eight players 
in double figures as the Hawks won their first game of the season in 
record-setting fashion. Atlanta's 148 points were the most ever for the Hawks 
at The Omni in Atlanta. The team's overall scoring record is 155 points, 
against San Diego in 1970 and New York in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks got their first victory after three consecutive losses as Orlando 
made only three of its first 19 shots. Atlanta held a 42-18 lead at the end of 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 122, Denver 108 -- David Robinson scored 15 of his 28 points in the 
third quarter and finished with 11 rebounds, leading the Spurs at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
After the Spurs led, 60-57, at the half, Robinson helped extend the margin to 
94-80 after three quarters. The center, in his first season after spending two 
years in the Navy, dazzled the crowd of 15,198 when he scored nine of the last 
10 points for the Spurs in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Cummings added 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs. Lafayette Lever 
led the Nuggets with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Walter Davis scored 21 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 100, Utah 92 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 24 points, 21 rebounds and a 
career-high 12 blocked shots to lead the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Houston took its first lead since the second quarter when Olajuwon made two 
free throws with 4:01 left. A free throw by Karl Malone tied the score, 86-86, 
with 2:40 left before a basket by Buck Johnson and two free throws by Otis 
Thorpe gave Houston a 90-86 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 104, Milwaukee 96 -- The 76ers, coming off a loss to the expansion 
Minnesota Timberwolves 24 hours earlier, got 23 points from Charles Barkley and 
20 from Hersey Hawkins to beat the Bucks at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:20 left in the game, the Bucks pulled to within 92-88 on a basket by Jay 
Humphries. Barkley countered with a free throw and a three-point play that gave 
the 76ers a 96-88 lead with 4:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 109, Seattle 102 -- Michael Jordan scored 25 points and Horace Grant 
added 23, leading the Bulls at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls trailed, 79-74, after a three-point play by Michael Cage late in the 
third quarter. But Chicago went ahead for good, 80-79, on Craig Hodges' 
five-footer with 2:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis had 30 points for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 115, Charlotte 104 -- Chris Mullin scored 34 points and Mitch 
Richmond 28 as the Warriors defeated the winless Hornets at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors outrebounded the Hornets, 42-28, the first time this season Golden 
State has outrebounded its opposition. In their previous four games, the 
Warriors had 14.3 fewer rebounds per game than their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte was led by Rex Chapman with 23 points, and Dell Curry came off the 
bench for 21, including three three-pointers in the third quarter.

MARYLAND GETS TIE -- IT FEELS LIKE WIN 
</P>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maryland acted like winners, while No. 13-ranked Penn State felt like losers. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in a 13-13 tie Saturday, ending Maryland's 24-game losing streak 
to Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel as good about this game as any game," Maryland Coach Joe Krivak said. 
"It's been so long and we've been so close for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
The Terrapins had lost to Penn State 24 times in 28 years, but four of their 
previous five losses had been by five points or less. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the Terps were faced with a fourth-and-five situation at the Penn 
State nine-yard line, Krivak had already made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He elected to let Dan DeArmas kick a 26-yard field goal, his second of the 
game, with 58 seconds left, and settle for the tie. 
</P>
<P>
"I had made up my mind that if we had the ball in close we'd try for the win 
but would kick the field goal and take the tie if it came down to it," Krivak 
said. "I wasn't going to give it away, and I'd do the same thing over again." 
</P>
<P>
The Nittany Lions had one last possession, and moved the ball to the Maryland 
48, but the game ended on an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
The tie gave Maryland a 3-6-1 record and left the Nittany Lions (6-2-1) feeling 
awful. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a loss for us," Penn State senior linebacker Brian Chizmar said. "A 
sick loss. It shouldn't have come down to a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Penn State Coach Joe Paterno: "I don't know what to feel. I didn't know 
what to tell the team. A tie is a loss for us. A tie for them seems to be a 
win." 
</P>
<P>
After Maryland tied the score at 10-10 on a 28-yard field goal by DeArmas with 
12:34 left and the two teams exchanged punts, Penn State drove 58 yards in 
three plays to the Maryland six. 
</P>
<P>
However, the drive stalled as three running plays lost a yard, and the Nittany 
Lions settled for a 24-yard field by Ray Tarasi with 5:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the Terrapins was quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who completed 18 of 24 
passes, including 14 in a row, for 219 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State running back Blair Thomas hit the 1,000-yard mark for the second 
time in his career. He gained 125 yards in 26 carries, giving him 1,077 yards 
this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullback Durwin Greggs ran for two touchdowns as No. 18 Virginia defeated 
Virginia Tech, 32-25, Saturday in a nonconference game at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers (9-2) held off a second-half comeback by the Hokies (5-4-1) to 
win their fifth consecutive game. The nine victories tie the school record. 
</P>
<P>
With Duke beating North Carolina State Saturday, Virginia and the Blue Devils 
are both 5-1 in Atlantic Coast Conference play and tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech trailed 24-0 at halftime, but rallied behind reserve quarterback 
Rodd Wooten, who took over when Cam Young left on the opening series of the 
third quarter with an arm injury. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech scored on an eight-yard pass from Wooten to Myron Richardson, and 
then Virginia answered with a 22-yard run by Greggs. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Hebron returned the ensuing kickoff 53 yards to the Virginia 45, and 
eight plays later, Marcus Mickel scored on an 11-yard reverse. Wooten's 
conversion pass to Phil Bryant cut Virginia's lead to 32-16 with 1:17 left in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech drove 56 yards midway through the final period, with a one-yard 
run by Rich Fox making it 32-22 with 5:25 to play. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 27, North Carolina 20 -- The Tar Heels took a 13-12 lead early 
in the fourth quarter, but Harold Green scored on a 19-yard run and Scott 
Windsor returned an interception 60 yards for another touchdown a minute later 
as Gamecocks won at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial pass-interference penalty kept alive the drive that led to 
Green's touchdown. The call was made by the side judge standing about 30 yards 
from the play. A wild protest by North Carolina Coach Mack Brown led to an 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured the Gamecocks (6-3-1) of their third consecutive winning 
season for the first time time since the early 1930s. North Carolina fell to 
1-9. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Louisiana 42, Lamar 33 -- Brian Mitchell set an NCAA record for 
career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback as he led the Rajin' Cajuns (6-4) 
over the Cardinals (4-6) at Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who had 214 rushing yards, ran for a school-record five touchdowns 
and now has 43 career rushing touchdowns, which breaks the old mark of 39, set 
by Freddie Solomon of Tampa from 1971 through '74. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also became only the fourth player in NCAA history to rush and pass 
for 1,000 yards each in the same season. A 159-yard passing performance next 
week against Arkansas State would make him the first player in NCAA history to 
rush for 1,000 yards and pass for 2,000 yards in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-10 senior, who passed for 162 yards, scored on runs of one, 11 and 
one yards in the first half and three and four yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
East Carolina 31, Temple 24 -- Travis Hunter threw two touchdown passes, caught 
a third and ran for another score as the Pirates (5-3-1) beat the Owls (0-10) 
at Greenville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest 29, Tulsa 17 -- Phil Barnhill threw four touchdown passes to lead 
the Demon Deacons over the Golden Hurricane at Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Barnhill had two scoring tosses to Ricky Proehl and one each to Steve Brown and 
Scott Clinard as Wake Forest improved to 2-7-1, possibly ending Tulsa's (5-5) 
hopes for a bid to the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary 24, James Madison 21 -- Robert Green scored the winning 
touchdown on a nine-yard run with 8:04 remaining in the game at Williamsburg, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes blew a 21-10 halftime lead, getting only two first downs in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, ranked No. 12 in Division I-AA, improved to 7-2-1, while the Dukes 
dropped to 5-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 40, Memphis State 10 -- Curtis Lipsey scored on runs of six and 63 
yards as the Cardinals (5-4) beat the Tigers (2-8) at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville led 17-3 at halftime after an array of Memphis State mistakes. All 
of the Cardinals' first-scoring came after Memphis State turnovers.

<P>
Rodney Hampton scored two touchdowns in a three-minute span of the second half 
Saturday as Georgia overcame a sluggish start and upset No. 20 Florida, 17-10, 
at Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton outrushed Florida's Emmitt Smith, 121 yards to 106, and had touchdown 
runs of 10 and two yards to lift the Bulldogs to a 17-7 lead with with 3:54 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Southeastern Conference, held Florida 
to a 24-yard field goal by John David Francis the rest of the way to win for 
the 14th time in the last 18 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, a last-minute loser to Auburn a week ago, was hoping to stay in the 
running for a Jan. 1 bowl game but fell to 6-3 and 3-3 before a neutral-site 
crowd of 81,577 at the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Smith led the Georgia defense with two of the Bulldogs' three interceptions 
of quarterbacks Donald Douglas and Lex Smith. Georgia also recovered a fumble 
and stopped Florida twice on downs to kill third-quarter scoring threats. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 38, Louisiana Tech 23 -- Alexander Wright scored two touchdowns and set 
up another with a 73-yard kickoff return as the No. 12 Tigers scored 28 points 
in a 2:30 span in a nonconference game at Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Williams also scored twice for the Tigers (7-2), who trailed 10-7 at 
the end of the first quarter. Louisiana Tech, which completed its first season 
of NCAA Division I play, dropped to 5-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who rushed for 106 yards in 17 carries, ran 36 yards for his first 
touchdown with 9:54 remaining in the half to put the Tigers ahead to stay.

</P>
<P>
Volunteer quarterback Andy Kelly threw touchdown passes of 40 yards to Thomas 
Woods and 22 yards to Greg Amsler. 
</P>
<P>
Amsler, a fullback, also threw an option touchdown pass of 37 yards to Vince 
Moore, and reserve quarterback Sterling Henton passed 72 yards to Woods for 
another score. 
</P>
<P>
The Vols set a school record with 588 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 15, Vanderbilt 11 -- Mike Thomas scored on an eight-yard run in the 
fourth quarter and Albert Burks stopped a late Commodore drive to lead the 
Wildcats at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky, 6-3 overall and 2-3 in the SEC, mounted a 12-play, 46-yard drive that 
ended in its only touchdown with 8:04 to play. The Wildcats snapped a 15-game 
road losing streak in the conference.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP;

<P>
BUCKEYES BLANK HAWKEYES, 28-0

<TEXT>
<P>
For Iowa Coach Hayden Fry, it was "the most frustrating day in my 38 years of 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
For Ohio State, it was the latest in a string of victories. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's maligned defense had its biggest day as the Buckeyes rolled to a 
28-0 Big-Ten victory over Iowa Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by two touchdowns by Scottie Graham and two scoring passes by Greg Frey, 
Ohio State registered its first shutout in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's last shutout victory was 33-0 over Minnesota in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State entered Saturday's game having allowed 27 points per game, and the 
Buckeyes were ranked last in the Big Ten in pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
But the Buckeyes shut down the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed we would play this poorly," said Fry. "We were terrible on 
offense and terrible in execution on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most frustrating day in my 38 years of coaching. It was my most 
disappointing loss." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fifth in a row for Ohio State, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the 
Big Ten, and keeps alive the Buckeyes' conference title hopes. Ohio State is 
one game out of first place with two games remaining. The Buckeyes play host to 
Wisconsin, then play at Michigan Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa fell to 4-5 and 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 89,536 at Ohio Stadium watched the Buckeyes score once in each 
quarter. Graham scored on a three-yard run in the first quarter and caught a 
nine-yard touchdown pass from Frey in the third quarter. Ohio State also got 
touchdowns on an eight-yard pass from Frey to Jeff Graham and a one-yard plunge 
by Dante Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 21, Minnesota 7 -- Courtney Hawkins caught nine passes for 197 
yards, including touchdowns of three and 47 yards, in leading the Spartans past 
the Gophers at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, a sophomore, moved into second place behind Andre Rison in Michigan 
State's record book. He needs five more catches and 45 yards to match Rison's 
record of 54 receptions for 966 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Enos completed 13 of 26 passes for 240 yards as the Spartans improved to 
5-4 and 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Scott Schaffner scrambled 36 yards for the Golden Gophers' lone 
score as Minnesota fell to 5-4 and 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 46, Northwestern 15 -- The Boilermakers scored 32 points in the first 
quarter in routing the Wildcats at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Smith got things going when he blocked a punt and returned it 35 yards for 
a touchdown. It was one of three blocked punts Purdue had in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, the Boilermakers had not scored a touchdown in the opening period in 
their last 12 games, dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Purdue's second most productive quarter ever. The Boilermakers scored 34 
points in the second quarter of a 51-6 victory over Indiana in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a seven-game losing streak for Purdue (2-7 and 1-5) as 
Northwestern (0-9 and 0-6) lost for the 10th consecutive time.

USC: OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, ONCE AGAIN A DOMINATING FORCE ON DEFENSE, DRAWS PRAISE 
AFTER HELPING LIMIT ARIZONA TO 158 RUSHING YARDS.

<P>
Dick Tomey has been either an assistant or head coach for 27 years and, in all 
that time, he said he has never seen a more dominant defensive player than 
USC's Junior Seau. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best player I've ever been on the field against as a coach," said the 
Arizona coach. "He's a force." 
</P>
<P>
USC's defense was the force Saturday at Arizona Stadium, where the Trojans 
clinched a Rose Bowl bid for the third consecutive year with a 24-3 victory 
over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, a junior outside linebacker, had only one sack to improve on his school 
record to 15. However, he had five unassisted tackles that left the Wildcats 
with 23 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
But statistics don't always reflect his dominance on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't block him on the run, or the pass and no one has all year," Tomey 
said. "He would be there to make the play no matter where the ball went." 
</P>
<P>
Tomey said that Seau lined up at nose tackle, end, or linebacker, while 
harassing quarterback Ronald Veal and the running backs. 
</P>
<P>
"Running away from him doesn't help, because he'll run you down from behind," 
Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
When informed of Tomey's praise, the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Seau said: 
</P>
<P>
"That puts a lot of pressure on me. We have a great defense that complements 
me. Give them the credit." 
</P>
<P>
USC restricted Arizona to 16 net yards passing, the fewest allowed by the 
Trojans since Iowa had minus 11 yards in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
However, Arizona is more renowned as a running team, averaging 245.2 yards 
before Saturday's game to lead the Pacific 10 Conference in that category. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojans shut down the Wildcats, yielding 158 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Veal seemed stunned as he sat on a bench in the Arizona dressing room. He 
sprained both of his ankles late in the game while being sacked and he spoke 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that's the best defense I've played against by far. You saw what they did 
to us," he said. "Their defense was quick and beat us off the line, and their 
secondary beat us to the corners." 
</P>
<P>
As for Seau, Veal said, "He's relentless." 
</P>
<P>
USC came into the game leading the nation in rushing defense, yielding an 
average of 51.9 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Samoan-born Seau just smiled when defense became a topic of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't win a national championship," Seau said, referring to USC's 8-2 
record. "But we can be a national champion defensive team." 
</P>
<P>
Tomey said that USC's offense is good, but added that the defense is the 
predominant edge for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the best in college football," the Arizona coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"As for Seau, I can't say enough about him." 
</P>
<P>
Tomey coached Seau's brother, David, a fullback, when he was Hawaii's coach 
before becoming Arizona's coach in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to recruit Seau for Arizona, but lost out to USC. However, Seau lost 
his freshman year of eligibility under the Proposition 48 academic ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Seau disrupts offenses just by his presence. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Veal peeking at me as early as the second quarter," Seau said. "So I 
knew we were doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
USC free safety Mark Carrier was wearing a cut off T-shirt with the words "Go 
East Side" stamped across the front of it. A small rose was also adorning the 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier said that several of the Trojans were wearing the "Go East Side" 
T-shirt, signifying tough, dedicated guys from the east side of town. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that USC altered its defensive scheme for Veal, who at times is an 
option quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"We had someone going after Veal on almost every play," Carrier said. "We 
didn't do it that much against Notre Dame and Tony Rice." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, Notre Dame's skilled option quarterback, was a decisive factor in the 
Irish's 24-20 win over USC on Oct 21. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in our defense this year as compared to last year is that we 
are attacking more now," Carrier said. "We want to set the tone from the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
Tomey, a former UCLA assistant coach, was gracious in the loss that eliminated 
his team from the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
"USC is a great team and they'll make a great representative for the league," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's likely that USC will play Michigan in the Rose Bowl game in a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
How does USC match up against Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
"I would think USC would fare well against anyone," Tomey said.

MIKE DOWNEY: SAME TIME NEXT YEAR FOR SMITH

Gene Fruge got a leg. Tim Ryan took the other. They went fast, like 
Thanksgiving drumsticks. And heave-ho, up went the USC football coach, jacked 
onto the broad shoulders of two 6-foot-5, 260-pound Trojan soldiers, who 
carried him away as cautiously and preciously as if bound back to Troy, bearing 
Helen. 
</P>
<P>
On his way home Saturday, Larry Smith felt better than he looked. His shirt was 
soaking wet. His hair was plastered to his head. The coach's own men had 
ambushed him, after USC's 24-3 Rose Bowl-securing conquest of Arizona, with a 
bucket of liquid refreshment. They Gatoraded the guy. He felt icky and sticky. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember when your kids are 2-years-old and they spill Kool-Aid all over you?" 
Smith asked, pinching the fabric of his soggy shirt with his fingers. "That's 
how this feels." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that's not the only way it feels. 
</P>
<P>
"Feels great," he had to admit. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was carried off this field before, on Arizona's side of it, after very 
pleasant victories over Arizona State and occasional other opponents of years 
gone by. This might be the part of the profession that coaches value most, the 
sensation of being hoisted onto the shoulders of their players, placed on a 
human pedestal for all to see. It shows love. It shows admiration. It shows 
respect. Most coaches live for these things. 
</P>
<P>
At 50 and at the top of his game, Larry Smith is liking this feeling more all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
He's got it down pat by now, that's for sure. He knows the drill. For three 
seasons, Smith has been USC's head man, and for the third time he is headed for 
Pasadena's swinging New Year's Day party. You can't do much better than that. 
Call up that Rose Queen and tell her she's got another date. Larry Smith is 
fast becoming the Rose King. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great football coach," Ryan said. "He's a champion." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he is. Now, only one bonus could make him more of a champion. That would 
be if the Trojans could win one of these Rose Bowl things for him. Then, Larry 
Smith's college coaching life would be complete. Not over, but complete. To 
ride off on the muscles of his players on the first day of 1990, now that would 
be a thrill. Maybe even he could outcoach Michigan's Bo Schembechler, for whom 
he once served. Might as well dream big. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it's an obsession, winning the Rose Bowl," Smith said. "It's 
very important, but it's not an obsession. It may seem like an obsession 
sometimes. You certainly work obsessed-wise when you're preparing for the game. 
But playing in the Rose Bowl is an honor, it's a privilege, it's a right, and 
it's a great opportunity for a bunch of deserving young guys. That's enough." 
</P>
<P>
They want this one, the upperclassmen do. Since Smith is 0-2 in Rose Bowls, 
then obviously so are some of them. And seeing as how 21 of 22 Trojan starters 
Saturday are seniors or juniors -- all but the quarterback -- you could hardly 
expect these people to be satisfied with just another conference championship, 
impressive as that may be. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the simple fact that USC keeps getting to Rose Bowls -- well, hey, like the 
man says, that's enough. A cheerleader was dancing Saturday with a rose 
clenched in his teeth, and the band was swinging and swaying long after the 
game, and a traveling assortment of fans kept chanting "Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl" 
betwixt more colorful comments that concerned UCLA. All in all, it was a USC 
football lover's favorite way to spend an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
As for Larry Smith, he got up at sun-up and went for a jog in his old 
neighborhood. By 6:30 a.m., he was running around, seeing familiar sights. Four 
months into this decade, Smith accepted the coaching job at Arizona and moved 
his family to this cactus-lined town. His son Corby, now a quarterback at 
Loyola High in Los Angeles, was 6 or 7 then, only a few years removed from 
spitting up Kool-Aid on Dad. 
</P>
<P>
The coach parted company with Arizona in 1987 when USC called, and the parting 
was not totally amicable. There was resentment on some fronts that he had not 
properly said goodby, and that of all the football teams he had to go coach, 
why did it have to be those conference enemies from USC? Smith was even hanged 
in effigy at one point, and was still the subject of an insult or two as 
Saturday's game drew near. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years seems like a long time," Smith said afterward. "But there's a part 
of me still here, and there always will be." 
</P>
<P>
He won't soon forget this return engagement, the way Larry Wallace took the 
day's first punt and ambled 29 yards with it, the way Cannonball Ervins took 
the quarterback's first handoff and propelled himself 50 yards with it, the way 
John Jackson kept his tippy-toes inside the boundary stripe and latched his 
sticky fingers onto a 24-yard pass, the way Junior Seau spent more time in the 
Arizona backfield than the Arizona backs. 
</P>
<P>
The players got everything right, right down to the soaking of the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Smith sniffed his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, smells pretty good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like roses, Larry. Like roses.

JOHNSON STARTS FAST, BUT FADES; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: QUARTERBACK COMPLETES 10 OF 11 PASSES IN THE FIRST HALF, BUT HE THROWS 
TWO INTERCEPTIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER THAT LEAD TO OREGON TOUCHDOWNS.

<P>
Quarterback Bret Johnson of UCLA had a forlorn look as he stood on the 
sidelines, arms folded across his chest. Johnson had been pulled after throwing 
two interceptions in the third quarter of a game against Oregon Saturday at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," Johnson said. "I just threw a couple of 
interceptions. And it came at a bad time." 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have come at a worse time. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Johnson completed 10 of 11 passes for 119 yards and one 
touchdown as the Bruins took a 20-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He played great in the first half. He ate us alive," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks 
said. "He scrambled and he threw the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson wasn't as sharp in the second half, completing only three of nine 
passes for 34 yards as the Ducks rallied to win, 38-20. Johnson didn't have as 
much time to pass in the second half because Oregon's aggressive pass rush 
forced him from the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bonds replaced Johnson at the start of the fourth quarter after Johnson 
threw the interceptions that led to two Oregon touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson appeared downcast on the sideline, he didn't appear that way 
in an interview room after the game. As he sat to face the media, he put a bag 
of ice on the table. He placed his left arm on the ice bag to prevent swelling 
in his bruised forearm, which he hurt when he was hit after throwing an 
incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Both interceptions were my fault, but both could have gone either way," 
Johnson said. "They were bad interceptions. There's no such thing as a good 
interception and that's why I got taken out." 
</P>
<P>
How did Johnson feel after being benched? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy, but it happens," Johnson said. "I had two interceptions and I 
guess I wasn't getting anything done." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said that Johnson wasn't responsible for both 
interceptions, one of which resulted from a receiver running the wrong route. 
Johnson overthrew a receiver on the other interception. 
</P>
<P>
"Bret played a marvelous first half," Donahue said. "But you can't go forever 
turning the football over. Our quarterback had just thrown back-to-back picks. 
In the second half, we weren't playing as well, we weren't moving the ball with 
opportunities to score. 
</P>
<P>
"In the fourth quarter I thought Jim Bonds might come off the bench to ignite 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds didn't ignite UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds struggled after replacing Johnson for the third time in the last four 
games, completing three of seven passes for 50 yards. He was also sacked three 
times for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds said it was difficult to come in cold. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three times I've gone in the game, we've been down a touchdown at 
least and that's the time where a quarterback wants to be playing, but it's 
hard when you haven't got a feel for the game or the other team's defense," 
Bonds said. "I was a little rusty when I came in and things didn't go the way I 
wish they would have." 
</P>
<P>
Did Bonds think he should have been inserted earlier in the game? 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Donahue had said that he wanted to play both of us and he wanted to get 
a look at me before next spring in a game situation, so I expected to go in 
earlier," Bonds said. "But Bret was having such a good game in the first half 
that I wasn't sure I was going to play at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I would have had a chance to start a game where both teams started off 
0-0. I wish I could go from there. But I haven't had that opportunity and it 
doesn't look like it's going to happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite being benched, Johnson will probably start for UCLA in next week's 
season finale against USC at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson started off well, completing his first nine passes. Johnson and wide 
receiver Mike Farr combined on a 72-yard touchdown pass play in the third 
quarter, but the play was nullified by a pass interference penalty on tight end 
Randy Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had a bad feeling when he saw an official drop the flag. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you know when the flag goes down that you can just start running to 
the end zone and celebrating a touchdown," Johnson said. "This year I just 
looked at the flag and I saw the official and I knew it was going to be 
something on us. It was just one of those years." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Neuheisel, UCLA quarterback coach, remains confident in Johnson despite 
his poor showing in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he played real well," Neuheisel said. "There are things people 
forget when you're playing at this level of football, that he's 19 years old 
and there's lot of things he hasn't learned yet and he will learn. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way are we disappointed in his play. I think in the long run Bret's 
going to be a really good quarterback. In no way is UCLA down on him."

GRAND CHAMPIONS TENNIS AT RANCHO SAN CLEMENTE; 
</P>
<P>
LLOYD COMES OF AGE, ADVANCES TO FINAL

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Age is a touchy subject for many people. 
</P>
<P>
But John Lloyd has been welcoming the added years since he retired from the 
Grand Prix tennis tour in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd craved to return to competition despite playing three short seasons with 
the Los Angeles Strings. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 35, he's a rookie among the oldtimers at the 35-and-over Prudential 
Bache Grand Champions event at the Rancho San Clemente Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really looking forward to getting to 35," Lloyd said. "When I retired, I 
didn't want to just drop off from being a professional tennis player." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Lloyd survived a tough challenge from Sandy Mayer in the singles 
semifinals to win, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, and advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd will play Hank Pfister, who defeated Bob Lutz of San Clemente, 6-4, 4-6, 
6-0, at 1 p.m. today. In the five Grand Champions events in which he has 
played, this is the fourth time that Lloyd has made the finals. He has won two 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd won the first set easily, but Mayer came back in the second. Mayer then 
went ahead, 2-0, in the third set when Lloyd double-faulted on break point. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd then broke Mayer's serve to make it 2-1, but was down 15-40 in the next 
game before rallying to win the match with strong serves. 
</P>
<P>
"From that point on, I felt like I was in charge," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes after defeating Mayer, Lloyd teamed with Dick Stockton in the 
doubles, losing to Kim Warwick and Sherwood Stewart, 6-1, 6-4. Warwick and 
Stewart will play Lutz and Mayer in the final. 
</P>
<P>
For Lloyd, who resides in Pacific Palisades and coaches professional tennis 
players, the Grand Champions is a chance to continue playing competitively 
while picking up extra income. He also appreciates the low-key atmosphere at 
these events. The tennis and the behavior is distinctly old-style, said Lloyd, 
who was born in England. 
</P>
<P>
It's a throwback to the days when the players weren't "bloody rude," on the 
court, he said, and acted "the way they should."

TENNIS ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MCENROE LOSES A MATCH TO FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guy Forget was just glad to be playing, while John McEnroe apparently wanted to 
be somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Forget, sidelined for five months by a knee injury earlier in the year, upset 
top-seeded John McEnroe, 6-4, 7-6, Saturday in the semifinals of an indoor 
tournament at Wembley, England. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt kind of tired," McEnroe said. "I was not able to want the match enough. 
It didn't mean enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The scheduling didn't help me this week," said McEnroe, who teamed up to win a 
doubles semifinal with Jakob Hlasek immediately after he lost to Forget. "I 
played better in doubles because I didn't have to run so fast. My body just 
wasn't up to it. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Michael Chang, who hasn't won a tournament since the 
French Open in June, defeated Wally Masur of Australia, 7-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Forget, a 24-year-old Frenchman, overpowered an unusually lethargic McEnroe to 
reach his second Grand Prix final of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I played this match very loose," Forget said. "Win or lose, I was happy to 
play. He didn't get a lot of first serves in, and that was very important." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, a five-time winner of this title who is ranked fourth in the world, 
hit a number of unforced errors and couldn't get his serve into gear. He still 
had enough chances to put Forget away, but blew a 4-2 lead in the first set and 
four set points at 5-4 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Forget was the lowest-ranked player to beat McEnroe in more than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl beat Stefan Edberg, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3, at Stockholm, Sweden, in the 
semifinals of the Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but he played very well," Wilander said. "I had my chances 
in the first set and I think I should have beaten him, but he played so well on 
the big points." 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden knocked off Mats Wilander, 
also of Sweden, 7-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Lendl romped through the opening set after it took almost 30 minutes 
to settle the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who beat Lendl the last time they met in the Japan Open final last 
April, broke for a 1-0 lead in the second set as his powerful serve-and-volley 
game finally got going. He broke again to lead, 5-2, then held to even the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who has won 14 consecutive matches, took a 2-0 lead in the decisive set 
with a brilliant cross-court return off Edberg's tricky kick serve. There were 
no other service breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union used a big first serve and a new 
game plan to upset third-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-4, and 
advance to the final of a Virginia Slims tournament at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Savchenko will play Zina Garrison, who struggled but beat 
Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Savchenko's first victory over Sukova in five meetings came when she changed 
her tactics after a three-set loss to Sukova in September in the fourth round 
of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"This time I made up my mind I was going to come to the net, and she hit a lot 
of balls out," Savchenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina defeated Mark Koevermans of the 
Netherlands, 7-5, 6-2, in the semifinals of a Grand Prix tournament at Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal, between fourth-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain and Jean 
Fleurian of France, was rained out and will be played today, followed by the 
final.

TENNISNEW MEN'S PRO TOUR HAVING DIFFICULT TIME GETTING STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men's professional tennis, which will soon move into a new decade with a new 
name, continues with an old problem: It just can't seem to stop 
double-faulting. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be a bulletin to those who follow the often wacky world of men's 
pro tennis. 
</P>
<P>
We know that in 1990 the Assn. of Tennis Professionals will run its own tour, 
which means that the Nabisco Grand Prix format is disappearing from sight 
faster than a serve by Boris Becker. But what we didn't know was that the new 
ATP tour would find it so difficult to do business when it's not even in 
business yet. 
</P>
<P>
What has gone wrong? 
</P>
<P>
1. When the ATP announced the number of tournaments each player must play, the 
players were shocked to learn that they would probably be playing more often 
than they did under the hated Grand Prix format. 
</P>
<P>
2. After the ATP announced its 1990 schedule, it was quickly determined that 
the Davis Cup dates were in conflict with what the International Tennis 
Federation had in mind for those dates. 
</P>
<P>
3. A month after ATP leader Hamilton Jordan strongly defended sanctioning two 
tournaments in South Africa, Jordan, in the wake of worldwide protest, reversed 
his position and the ATP dropped the events. 
</P>
<P>
But all of those gaffes pale in comparison to the latest uproar, the result of 
an apparent attempt by the ITF to scuttle the ATP and its crown jewel 
tournament, the season-ending ATP finals. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ITF's Grand Slam Committee said that its $6-million Grand Slam Cup 
was not meant to harm the ATP Tour, the Cup offers $2 million to the winner, 
which matches the entire prize purse of the ATP finals and is twice as much as 
the total prize money for 128 players at this year's Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Grand Slam Cup is not part of the ATP tour and carries no computer 
points, it is regarded as an exhibition, with players qualifying on the basis 
of Grand Slam results and Davis Cup competition. There is already some 
speculation that the ITF will soon get into the ratings business itself by 
assigning computer points to its four Grand Slam events as well as the new 
Grand Slam Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The ATP has threatened to retaliate against the ITF, saying that the "Grand 
Slam exhibition is a blatant and petty attempt by the ITF and the Slams to 
disrupt the new (ATP) Tour, which the elite ITF leadership and the Grand Slams 
have steadfastly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to engage in petty games with the ITF, but the ATP Tour is 
resolved to take strong action to protect the interests of the tournaments and 
the players which compose the new system." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup is scheduled for Dec. 10-16, 1990, possibly in Stuttgart, 
West Germany, two weeks after the ATP season-ending event in Frankfurt and 
during the so-called "off period" that is to last until the 1991 Australian 
Open in late January. However, the West German Tennis Federation refused this 
week to sanction the Grand Slam Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Several leading players who would benefit from the ITF event have criticized 
it, among them John McEnroe and Boris Becker, using terms such as obscene and 
grotesque, but ITF officials have defended the amount of prize money it will 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The same (words) would have been said 10 years ago about all the tournaments 
today with $1 million, or more, in prize money," said Bill Babcock, 
administrator of the Grand Slam Committee. "Market forces have inevitably 
pushed the prize money levels up." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup would be limited to eight players based on their performance 
in the Grand Slam events -- Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens 
-- as well as the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The key figure in this latest controversy is Becker. 
</P>
<P>
If Becker plays, the event gains instant credibility. If he does not play, it 
may be an automatic flop. Becker, who has tremendous drawing power in West 
Germany, said he has not decided if he will play in the Grand Slam Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It could create problems with the ATP tour," he said. "The Grand Slam Cup is 
facing a lot of problems, and I will like to talk to some people at the ITF to 
know what they are going to do about it, apart from giving so much money." 
</P>
<P>
Becker wondered how the Grand Slam Cup would be affected if he were not part of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
"A Grand Slam has a tradition behind it and that event is only money and, in my 
opinion, it's just not my thing," he said. "It wouldn't influence me. Rather it 
would influence the ITF, who would have a tournament in Germany without Boris 
Becker. It's like having Roland Garros (the French Open) without Yannick Noah." 
</P>
<P>
"If the tournament were to be played in the United States, it wouldn't be such 
a story if I didn't go," he said. "But in Germany, it is more of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who turns 22 on Nov. 22, has made more than $5.5 million in official 
earnings in his career and has earned many times that in exhibitions and 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the future of tennis and the sake of the game, it must be a very 
serious decision to take and not only think about money," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
The female players are currently without strife. The $1-million Virginia Slims 
Championships are Nov. 13-29 at Madison Square Garden in New York, where the 
only question is the usual one: Who is going to beat Steffi Graf? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, it was Pam Shriver, but Shriver's singles game is in shreds and she 
did not qualify for the event. The winner gets $125,000. Chris Evert did 
qualify, but declined to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the 16-player field are Graf, Martina Navratilova and defending 
champion Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
The other players are Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Zina Garrison, Helena Sukova, 
Jana Novotna, Monica Seles, Mary Joe Fernandez, Manuela Maleeva, Catarina 
Lindqvist, Rafaella Reggi, Hana Mandlikova, Conchita Martinez, Helen Kelesi and 
Gretchen Magers. 
</P>
<P>
Broken up about it: Navratilova broke up with Shriver as a doubles team before 
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, but they teamed again last week at the 
Virginia Slims of New England in Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Narvatilova-Shriver also will play doubles at the Slims Championships, but they 
have no plans to team after that. 
</P>
<P>
At the Australian Open, which Navratilova and Shriver have won eight times, 
Navratilova is planning to play doubles with Mandlikova. 
</P>
<P>
Shed a tear for the Nabisco Masters, which becomes extinct after this year's 
event. The $750,000, eight-player tournament will be played Nov. 28-Dec. 3 at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Each player gets $15,000 for qualifying and then plays three round-robin 
matches, worth $30,000 each to the winner, the loser getting nothing. Winning 
semifinalists earn $60,000 and the winner of the final gets $150,000, so if a 
player goes through his five matches undefeated, he will win $315,000. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the season-ending bonus pool money has already been determined. 
Ivan Lendl will get $800,000. Lendl, who is back at the Masters for the 10th 
time, has made it to the final every year. A five-time Masters champion, he 
lost last year to Becker in a five-set classic. Besides Lendl, Becker, Stefan 
Edberg, Brad Gilbert and John McEnroe have already qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, who played last week in the Benson and Hedges Championships, 
indoors at London's Wembley Arena, and plays next week at Itaparica, Brazil, 
has a good chance to qualify, as does Aaron Krickstein.

<P>
CHAOS AT START OF THE RACE TO CABO SAN LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aggressive sailing in light, five-knot winds led to a chaotic start for the big 
boats in the 13th biennial Long Beach-to-Cabo San Lucas race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Yacht Club set a 3,000-foot-long line for the 24 boats, but 
several bunched up at the favored pin (left) end. Mitchell Rouse's Taxi Driver 
from LBYC brushed Peter Tong's Lady Godiva, which indicated that it will file a 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Farrah's Blondie (LBYC) was pushed over early and had to re-start, as did 
Bob Doughty's Evolution from the California Yacht Club and Mongoose from San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
As the confusion cleared, Les George's My Obsession II from Oceanside Yacht 
Club had the early lead in the 820-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
Among the eight smaller boats that started at noon Friday, Bruce Anderson's AND 
36 Chicken Lips from Shoreline Yacht Club was reported at 8 a.m. Saturday to be 
only 87 miles out in three knots of southeast wind on glassy seas. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Rosendale's Bandit was two miles back. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet must finish by noon Saturday to make the race official.

OCCIDENTAL TAKES CONFERENCE TITLE WITH 7-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funny how Whittier College -- a team that is third in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference -- seems to bring out the worst in 
Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks after the Tigers' dismal performance in a loss at Whittier, 
Occidental accounted for only 172 yards and seven points. The Tigers didn't 
even score a touchdown, posting their points on two safeties and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that proved sufficient as Occidental defeated Whittier, 7-0, Saturday night 
in a conference finale at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Tigers clinched the SCIAC championship outright. 
Occidental (6 1/2-1 1/2 overall, 4-0-1 in conference play) has won or shared 
the title for three consecutive years and six of the past seven. 
</P>
<P>
A bright point was the play of the Tigers' defensive front, which sacked 
quarterback Mike Haney eight times. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers trapped Whittier (2 1/2-5 1/2, 2 1/2-2 1/2) deep in its own 
territory midway through the fourth quarter. Punter Stuart Lewin was in the 
Poets' end zone to receive the snap but the ball sailed over his head. Lewin 
attempted to get the kick off but stepped out of the end zone for a safety -- 
Whittier's second -- giving Occidental a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Dickinson returned the ensuing kick 75 yards for an apparent Occidental 
score, but the run was nullified by a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Occidental was penalized 14 times for 105 yards. Whittier was flagged 
seven times for 100. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers took a 2-0 edge with 3:56 to play in the first quarter after Jeremy 
Dickinson blocked Stuart Lewin's punt out of the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Collinsworth made a 30-yard field goal midway through the second quarter 
to give the Tigers a 5-0 advantage. The 10-play scoring drive began at the 
Whittier 45 and was kept alive by an unsportsmanlike conduct call. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier, which has gained the fewest yards in conference play (280.1 yards a 
game), showed why in the first half, netting just nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental did not fare much better. The Tigers' top back, Gary Little, gained 
37 yards in 15 carries. Little's first run -- of 37 yards -- was called back 
due to an illegal-procedure penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Little fumbled his second carry and the ball was recovered by Whittier's Chad 
Ledbetter at the Occidental 22. 
</P>
<P>
Six plays later, Michael Westmoreland attempted a 22-yard field goal but the 
kick was blocked by Brady Dargan. It was the last time the Poets threatened in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Werbelow provided some offense between the 20-yard lines for the Tigers, 
completing seven of eight passes for 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Haney, who was sacked five times in the first half, completed two of nine 
passes for 19 yards.

WESTLAKE ROLLS TO WIN IN GIRLS' TENNIS PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westlake High swept host La Canada, 18-0, on Saturday in the second round of 
the Southern Section 3-A Division girls' tennis playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (21-0) were led by No. 1 singles player Jennifer Reese, who posted 
6-0, 6-1 and 6-1 victories. Westlake will play Calabasas in a quarterfinal 
match Tuesday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, Westlake's No. 1 team of Alyse Bartelstone and Alison Levitt 
defeated Krista Stamison and Bridget Sorenson, 6-3; Heather Blanche and Jenny 
Mayer, 6-2; and Shannon Hendler and Alison Horssall, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada finished 16-5.

MONTCLAIR PREP KEEPS ITS POISE, PERFECT RECORD

<P>
Question: When in 1989 has the outcome of a Montclair Prep football game come 
down to an onside kick with barely a minute left? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Never. 
</P>
<P>
That is, of course, before Saturday night's emotional contest with Alpha League 
rival Village Christian at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
This one, in fact, did come down to an onside kick. But the Mounties recovered 
the ball, smothering an upset bid by the courageous Crusaders, 28-20, to 
complete the regular season with a flawless 10-0 mark heading into the Division 
IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of my kids," Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance said. "I'm never 
happy with a loser, but I couldn't ask for a better game." 
</P>
<P>
That he couldn't. Although Montclair Prep led at halftime, 14-12, Mark Vail (12 
of 23, 177 yards), the Crusaders' sophomore quarterback, had picked apart a 
flustered Mountie secondary, and eyebrows were being raised. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties, though, as they have all year, went to their strengths -- Michael 
Jones, who finished with 149 yards in 23 carries and one touchdown, and Derek 
Sparks, who came back from a neck injury at halftime to finish with 158 yards 
in 14 carries. Sparks scored with just 5:47 left to give Montclair Prep a 28-12 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the competitor, Vail, who ran for one touchdown and threw for two more, 
marched Village Christian 58 yards in four plays, capping the drive with a 
nine-yard touchdown pass to Mark Bates with just 1:11 left to account for the 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
The onside kick followed and Montclair Prep had its victory. The only question 
left for Village Christian (5-5, 2-3), which headed home for the season: Do 
moral victories count? BRIAN MURPHY

Flintridge Prep 23, Faith Baptist 14 -- The Rebels had lost to Faith Baptist by 
17 points in the regular season and trailed, 14-0, late in the first half at 
Faith Baptist before rallying. 
</P>
<P>
Running back John Garrett's four-yard run capped an 11-play, 67-yard drive that 
had begun at the outset of the fourth quarter to give Flintridge Prep a 16-14 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels regained possession when Faith Baptist failed to convert on fourth 
down from its 29. Six plays later, Paul Park scored on a two-yard run to 
complete the scoring with 2:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist quarterback Gavin Amos, who completed nine of 19 passes for 117 
yards, threw interceptions on the Contenders' next two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Faith Baptist (7-2) built a 14-0 lead in the second quarter on a 
12-yard touchdown run by Amos and a 21-yard scoring pass from Amos to Alex 
Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
But Flintridge Prep (7-2) scored on the final play of the first half on J. J. 
Robinson's one-yard run, then limited the Contenders to 72 total yards in the 
second half. DAVE DESMOND

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS' BASEBALL RALLY IS A BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State's baseball team has had numerous rallies in its 52-year 
history, but none quite like the one it had Saturday afternoon at Charlie Smith 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
There were no runs, no hits and no men left on base, but the rally held to 
determine the baseball program's standing in the community netted approximately 
3,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous donor, who pledged an unspecified but significant amount of money 
to build a 4,000-seat baseball stadium, and Athletic Director Fred Miller 
wanted to know what kind of support SDSU baseball had in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, as well as a number of other sports at SDSU, have been hit with 
financial cuts because of an athletic department deficit exceeding $500,000. 
There has been talk of discontinuing the baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
"We were geared up for maybe a thousand people, and we had about 3,200," said 
an ecstatic Jim Dietz, SDSU's coach. "We had enough sign-up sheets for 3,200, 
and we ran out. I was stunned. It went way beyond my expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz added that there were about 2,000 additional pieces of mail on his desk, 
many of which were from fans indicating they could not attend because of other 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour program included the unveiling of the stadium plans, a 
memorabilia stand, a professionally-edited highlight video and the appearances 
of many former Aztecs, including Tony Gwynn of the Padres and the Cleveland 
Indians' Bud Black. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the turnout surprised him, Black said, "In a way yes. In a way no. 
Nothing Jim does surprises me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn, "I understand that college is now a business . . . but for them to 
even consider giving up baseball is really tough to swallow." JIM LINDGREN

FOOTBALL: WITH AN EXPANDED 16-TEAM FORMAT, MUCH OF THE STING HAS GONE FROM THE 
SELECTION AND SEEDING OF THE SAN DIEGO SECTION TOURNAMENT FIELD.

<P>
What's this? A San Diego Section football seeding meeting without dissension, 
angry coaches or controversy? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. For the first time ever, the section allowed 16 teams into the 
playoffs, up from the 12 that have gone the past several years. While the 
format received only mixed reviews when it was approved, the feedback at the 
seeding meeting was quite positive. 
</P>
<P>
All the borderline teams that in years past got shoved aside, got in this year. 
Hey, even a last-place team made it. 
</P>
<P>
Not much to argue about here. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was their any bickering on the choice of the top four seeds. In the 
3-A, Rancho Buena Vista (7-3, 7-0 for first place in the Palomar) got the first 
seed; Morse (8-2, 5-0 in the City Eastern) was No. 2; Chula Vista (9-0-1, 6-0-1 
in the Metro) got No. 3 and Helix (7-1-1, 4-0 in the Grossmont) was seeded 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, El Camino (9-1, 6-0 in the Avocado) earned the top seed; Grossmont 
(9-0-1, 4-0 in the Grossmont) was No. 2; Kearny (9-1, 5-0 in the City Western) 
took the third seed and Crawford (8-2, 4-1 in the City Central) was seeded 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A's first round to be played Friday and Saturday, Rancho draws, 
Patrick Henry (4-6, 1-4), which finished tied for last in the City Eastern. 
Morse will play Bonita Vista (5-4-1, 4-3 in the Metro), Chula Vista gets Vista 
(4-6, 3-4 in the Palomar) and Helix hosts Orange Glen (5-5, 3-4 in the 
Palomar). 
</P>
<P>
All of those games will be played Friday at 7:30, and all except the 
Morse-Bonita Vista contest will be played on the seeded team's field. Morse, 
which does not have lights, elected to play at Southwestern College, an odd 
choice considering Southwestern, which sits right across the street from Bonita 
Vista, is the Barons' home field. 
</P>
<P>
Now about Patrick Henry. It should be noted that the Patriots finished in a 
three-way tie for last place in the Eastern with Madison (4-6 overall) and 
Serra (3-7 overall), and, in fact, lost to Serra, 18-13, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, El Camino plays Valhalla (4-5-1, 2-2), Grossmont hosts San Marcos 
(3-6, 2-4 in the Avocado), Kearny gets St. Augustine (6-4, 3-2 in the Central) 
and Crawford goes up against Ramona (6-4, 3-3 in the Avocado). 
</P>
<P>
All but two of those 2-A games are scheduled for Friday at 7:30 at the seeded 
team's home field. The exceptions: Kearny will play at Mesa College and 
Crawford will play at Patrick Henry. 
</P>
<P>
The only 2-A school that made a bid to be included but was not was La Jolla 
(3-6-1, 1-4 in the Western). In the 3-A, Fallbrook (3-7, 3-4 in the Palomar) 
and Poway (4-6, 2-5 in the Palomar) were denied.

USD GOES TO 7-2 WITH VICTORY OVER MENLO, AWAITS PLAYOFF FATE

<P>
The University of San Diego, searching for a promotional theme for the athletic 
department's 1989-90 school year, decided on "A Quiet Tradition of Excellence." 
</P>
<P>
It just as well could be the theme for Todd Jackson and the Torero football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a senior fullback, rushed for 149 yards and three touchdowns to lead 
USD to a resounding, 31-19, victory over Menlo College Saturday in front of a 
standing-room-only homecoming crowd of over 4,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's big day, on 30 carries, gives him 1,003 yards for the season and 
increases his school-record career total to 2,175. 
</P>
<P>
USD concluded its regular season 7-2 and will find out this morning if it has 
made the NCAA Division III playoffs. The Toreros, whose two losses were to 
traditional powers Occidental and UC Santa Barbara (a Division II team), were 
informed before the game they are still very much in the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
But of the six teams ranked in the West Region (USD was unranked), only No. 3 
Simpson lost Saturday, and that was to No. 1 Central of Iowa. The NCAA chooses 
four teams from each region for the 16-team playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Menlo, which USD defeated for the first time, fell to 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
USD, as has been its trademark all year, raced to a 17-0 first-half lead. The 
Toreros have led at the half in eight of their nine games -- UCSB being the 
exception -- outscoring their opponents, 141-58. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who topped the 100-yard mark for the fifth time, has averaged nearly 
70 first-half rushing yards. Amazingly, in 189 carries this season, Jackson has 
lost only 10 yards and has fumbled just twice -- both coming Saturday, with USD 
recovering both. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had 52 yards and a touchdown in the first half against Menlo, and 
quarterback Brendan Murphy added 55 yards on seven carries. Murphy also 
completed three of five passes for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Menlo scored just before the extended homecoming intermission to make it 17-7. 
That was the same halftime score as in the Occidental game, which ended in a 
23-17 Occidental victory. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of talk at halftime, 'Let's not have another Oxy,' " Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and the Torero defense saw to that. Running behind the offensive line 
of Mark Garcia, Jeff Carpenter, Gene Fontana, Sean Parks and Ray Smith, Jackson 
had 97 yards and two touchdowns in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe a lot to my line," said Jackson, who is a strong candidate for the 
Division III All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
The last USD runner to gain 1,000 yards was Jerome McAlpin in 1983, Coach Brian 
Fogarty's first year at USD. McAlpin accomplished that in a 10-game season. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive stars were multiple but headed by linebackers Don MacInnes, who 
batted down four passes at the line of scrimmage, and Lenny Territo, who had 
two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
With Todd Whitley gaining 66 yards and Ty Barksdale 38, USD rushed for 357 
yards to Menlo's 37. Dave Bergmann, who entered as the Division III leader in 
field goals, kicked a 23-yarder, increasing his school-record to 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total team effort," Territo said. "We really wanted to go to the 
playoffs."

AT HOME: CITY IS OLD, BUT FULL OF LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
MONROVIA: AMBITIOUS REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN THE '70S TRIGGERED ECONOMIC 
IMPROVEMENTS AND REKINDLED THE SMALL-TOWN SPIRIT OF RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN DE WOLFE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Last one to leave town, turn off the lights" was a popular refrain in the 
1970s when residents of Monrovia began looking beyond the town's borders for a 
decent place to shop, to eat and to do business. 
</P>
<P>
"But that was long before we came to live here," said Margo Silverman, a former 
Hollywood resident, who likes the community's small-town, Midwestern atmosphere 
and boasts about its rebirth in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of almost 36,000, Monrovia hugs the foothills of the San 
Gabriel Mountains 8 miles east of Pasadena, and is the fourth oldest 
incorporated city in Los Angeles County. Its immediate neighbors are Arcadia to 
the west and Duarte to the east. 
</P>
<P>
The activity at the Silvermans on a recent Sunday afternoon centered on getting 
8-year-old daughter Lauren ready for a children's recital at Library Park, one 
of a series of community family events that reflect the town's feeling of 
"togetherness." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good place to raise a family," said Ken Silverman, a media consultant 
whose work takes him on daily commutes to Westside clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are friendly here," Margo Silverman added. "Besides, where else 
could a young family like ours find such a large and beautiful old home . . . 
for an affordable rent?" Realtor Miles Tolbert agreed that home rentals are 
reasonably priced in Monrovia and said he had just rented a three-bedroom home 
with 1 3/4 baths and swimming pool for $1,450 a month, adding that landlords 
usually accept tenants with children and pets. 
</P>
<P>
One-bedroom apartments, he said, rent for between $475 and $600 and two-bedroom 
units in medium-income neighborhoods rent for $700 to $900. 
</P>
<P>
Tolbert, 80, has lived in Monrovia for 55 years and has seen many changes in 
its property values. He bought a two-bedroom home there in 1936 for $1,700 with 
only a $300 down payment and a monthly mortgage of $16.80. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present home was built for under $20,000 in 1960 on a lot with an existing 
structure. We invested a total of $33,500, and today the property is worth 
about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"But, at least for a while, I think property values have topped out," Tolbert 
said, adding that a home in Monrovia may still be a good buy for families who 
want to settle there. "They can expect some appreciation in the long run but 
Monrovia is no longer an area for speculators." 
</P>
<P>
The city is served by two major freeways, the Foothill (210) and the San 
Bernardino (10) and its northern and southern sections are divided by a stretch 
of Huntington Drive that has become the community's major regional shopping 
focus, with outlets such as Mervyn's, Builders Emporium, Home Depot and an 
impressive "auto row" now anchored there. 
</P>
<P>
For most Monrovians, however, Myrtle Avenue remains the heart of the town. 
</P>
<P>
Myrtle has evolved from an unpaved Victorian horse-and-buggy street into a 
charming Park Plaza Village setting with landscaped areas, brick walks with 
shade trees and benches, and a variety of small shops, restaurants and 
shopkeepers who greet their customers by name. 
</P>
<P>
A familiar face along Myrtle Avenue is that of Steve Baker, parish 
administrator at St. Luke's Episcopal Church and president of Monrovia's 
Historical Society. Baker lives around the corner from the town's main street 
in an 1887 house that belonged to his great-grandfather. It is where his 
grandmother lived and where his father was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I also attended the same local grammar school as my father," Baker said, 
adding that in spite of the changes, the community has deep roots and retains 
many of its traditional values, pulling together whenever a common need arises. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example, Baker said, was demonstrated when Monrovia -- like other older 
cities in the San Gabriel Valley -- began experiencing serious economic 
problems due to competition from chain retailers in outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
It took an ambitious redevelopment effort in 1977 to trigger the revitalization 
of the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the leaders in the effort was Pat Ostrye, a longtime resident who was 
married and raised seven children in Monrovia. Ostrye was the first woman to 
serve on Monrovia's City Council and the city's first elected mayor (1978-79). 
She later served as city clerk.

"Whenever something needs to be done in this town, everybody joins in," Ostrye 
said, "It was a major cooperative effort of schools, government, chamber of 
commerce, business and the residents that put this town back together again." 
</P>
<P>
Major improvements were completed in time for the city's centennial celebration 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia was named for William Newton Monroe, a railroad construction engineer 
who came to Southern California in 1875. In the spring of 1886, with former Los 
Angeles Mayor John D. Bicknell and James F. Crank, Monroe laid out a 60-acre 
town on land purchased from the grant holders of the ranchos Santa Anita and 
Azusa de Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Its tree-shaded streets are lined with a wealth of Victorian, Queen Anne and 
Craftsman-styled homes set on spacious grounds. Some of the city's older homes 
such as the Old Burr house, which Ramon and Maryann Otero have restored, date 
back to its founding days. And so does the surviving Aztec Hotel that is on the 
National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why so many period movies are shot here," said Karen Poindexter, who 
describes her own Colonial Revival home as "everyone's idealized version of 
grandma's house." 
</P>
<P>
Karen and Doug Poindexter, active members of Monrovia's 200-member Old House 
Preservation Group, purchased their home 10 years ago for $93,500, and while 
they've done very little renovation, the home has quadrupled in value, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lou and Cathy Cisneros, owners of the local brokerage firm of L &amp; C, 
believe property values in Monrovia are still on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while there was a pervasive 'down' feeling in this community. But since 
the combined redevelopment efforts of city, schools and the affirmative action 
of Neighborhood Watch groups, there is something of the boom-town feeling again 
in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"The hottest market is for affordable homes under $200,000," he said. "One home 
that sold last fall for $106,000 was resold this July for $157,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are very scarce and move quickly, In the community's more desirable 
areas, north of Foothill Boulevard, home prices average in excess of $300,000." 
</P>
<P>
Janice Marugg, who heads the local Chamber of Commerce, led the visitor on a 
tour of Gold Hills, for a look at Monrovia's most ambitious residential 
development to date, just north of Myrtle Avenue and Scenic Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I grew up in Monrovia, and Gold Hills was our favorite 
playground as children," she said. "It's the largest foothill subdivision ever 
to be undertaken in Monrovia, with 54 lots on 60 acres, and its remaining 30 
acres were held for permanent open space." 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "the rich country of Monrovia," Gold Hills' large new luxury homes are 
selling in the million-dollar range. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the City Council approved an $8-million, five-year plan to boost 
private development of low-cost condominiums in an effort to also enhance 
Monrovia's poorer neighborhoods, Marugg said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Monrovia now gets some of the worst smog in the county, both from 
industries sprawled for miles around and from the busy freeway traffic nearby, 
doesn't seem to bother Marugg, who is the first to admit that "some days the 
smog is terrible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember when we had smudge pots burning in the orchards and the smog 
was even worse then," Marugg said. "The irony is that Monrovia was once a 
sought-after health resort with a major tuberculosis sanitarium." 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia's present concerns apparently relate less to smog and summer heat -- 
10 degrees warmer than in Los Angeles -- than they do to drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"We face much of the same law enforcement problems as other communities in the 
Southland. Drugs and gangs are our primary concern," said Police Chief Bill 
Tubbs, who's been with the Monrovia Police Department for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
But when asked about crime in her community, one Monrovian replied: 
</P>
<P>
"When we had serious trouble with drug dealing in one of our neighborhoods, the 
residents banded together, and with the help of the local police force 
activated a Drug Task Force that's been very effective. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how it is in Monrovia. We band together."

FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON CONDO CONVERSION RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Substitute conditional-use permits are being issued by the city of West 
Hollywood to residents who bought certain condominiums between Dec. 17, 1986 
and July 13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The permits are intended to allow owners and sellers of the units the legal 
right to buy and sell them, no matter what the outcome of the city's continuing 
court battle with developers over the status of certain apartments and 
condominiums in West Hollywood ("W. Hollywood Clarifies Condo Conversion 
Status," Nov. 5, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
However, if the city loses its case when it goes before the state Supreme Court 
early next year, the conditional use permit requirement could be declared 
illegal, and therefore unnecessary, according to Christi Hogin, West Hollywood 
assistant city attorney. Sale of condominium units would thus be allowed to 
continue without the owner obtaining such a city permit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court affirms the city's conditional use permit requirement, the 
permits the city is now issuing will assure the legal status of these units as 
condominiums, Hogin said. If the ruling is affirmative, the sale of units 
bought directly from developers after July 13, 1989 would remain subject to 
cancellation by the city. If a sale is canceled, buyers would be entitled to a 
full refund, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to buy a condominium in West Hollywood today, don't buy it 
from a developer unless he can show you a conditional use permit," Hogin 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
If an individual who owns a condominium unit contacts the city attorney's 
office now, he can get an application for a substitute conditional use permit, 
Hogin said. "Assuming this person is not the developer or related to the 
developer, the city will issue the permit and that will free them to buy and 
sell their unit." 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court is expected to rule on the matter in late March.

NEW YORK RACING SLIPPING, ITS BIAS SHOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even after Sunday Silence won the Breeders' Cup Classic, defeating Easy Goer 
for the third time in four meetings, trainer Charlie Whittingham wasn't 
convinced his colt would be named the horse of the year for 1989. "He'll have a 
chance," Whittingham said. "But the New York writers are difficult, and the 
ones in New Jersey are no bargain. Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
This has been a recurring theme of the rivalry between the two colts, with 
Sunday Silence's loyalists insisting that he never has received proper respect 
because of his California origins. Whittingham grumbled that New Yorkers would 
hail any Easy Goer victory as a brilliant achievement and dismiss any Sunday 
Silence victory as a fluke. Indeed, Steve Crist wrote in The New York Times 
that Easy Goer would establish himself as the horse of the decade if he won the 
Classic. When Sunday Silence scored his brilliant, decisive victory, he 
received no such anointment. 
</P>
<P>
The Easy Goer-Sunday Silence rivalry not only exposed a lot of Eastern 
provincialism, but it also reflected the declining condition of New York racing 
in general. Like the post-Copernican clerics, New Yorkers are learning that 
they no longer dwell at the center of the universe, but many of them still are 
decrying this truth as heresy. 
</P>
<P>
Until the late 1970s, New York was the site of most of America's definitive 
championship races. The winner of the Woodward Stakes was named the horse of 
the year 12 times in a 20-year span. But in the 1980s, the whole face of U.S. 
racing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup has robbed many of the year-end New York stakes of their 
traditional importance. California offers more purse money than New York and 
its major stakes are drawing fields at least as strong as their counterparts in 
the East. Tracks around the country have created new big-money stakes as 
box-office attractions. And in most cases the New York Racing Association has 
not made noticeable efforts to counter this increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the cases of the 105-year-old Suburban Handicap and the 2-year-old 
Pimlico Special. Both races attempt to attract older male horses at roughly the 
same distance at roughly the same time of the year. But Pimlico aggressively 
promoted its new attraction, offered a $700,000 purse and attempted to lure top 
horses from all over the country. In its first two years, the Special has drawn 
fields as strong as any race in America but the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the New York Racing Association puts up $350,000 for the Suburban 
and lets it rest on its reputation. This year not a single out-of-town horse 
shipped to New York for the race, which was won by Dancing Spree -- his only 
non-sprint victory of the year. In 1988 the Suburban drew a field of four; in 
1987 a weak field of five. It bears no resemblance to the race that used to be 
a showcase for great champions like Kelso, Damascus and Dr. Fager. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to the Suburban has happened to race after race on the New 
York stakes calendar. Even the ones with Grade I status and noble histories are 
drawing small, uncompetitive fields. It is easy for a good horse to win them. 
As a result, New York has been regularly producing horses who roar through 
these famous races and look so dominant that the local media hail them as 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
Devil's Bag was lauded as a potential horse of the decade as a 2-year-old in 
New York in 1983, but flopped out of town the next spring. Ogygian (remember 
him?) was hailed as a budding superhorse in 1986. And in 1987, New Yorkers 
denigrated Alysheba, who never ducked a challenge, and insisted that the best 
horse in America was Java Gold, who never left New York but looked so 
impressive beating a five-horse field in the Marlboro Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is a great racehorse but he is also the epitome of this New York 
syndrome. His record in graded stakes in New York is a perfect nine for nine. 
In graded stakes outside New York he is zero for four. But what was most 
telling about New York racing, and about the Eastern media bias that 
Whittingham decries, was the period between the Belmont Stakes and the 
Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's Belmont victory had been a smashing one, but he still was one for 
three against Sunday Silence and had much to prove. But when he beat the 
undistinguished Its Acedemic in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont, he was hailed 
as if the race were still a definitive championship event. When he crossed the 
finish line ahead of Forever Silver in the Whitney Stakes at Saratoga, track 
announcer Marshall Cassidy hailed "New York's horse of the year, Easy Goer." 
</P>
<P>
It may be important to keep a sense of perspective about New York stakes races 
next season, for Easy Goer might never again race anywhere but Belmont Park -- 
the site of the 1990 Breeders' Cup. Trainer Shug McGaughey said his colt's 
first objective will be Belmont Park's archaic Handicap Triple Crown series, 
which includes the Suburban Handicap. It already is a safe bet he will win it 
against a weak field, and that the Eastern media will hail him as a superhorse 
for doing so.

CAN OTHER BROTHERS STOP 1A AND 1B IN BIG EAST?; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: GEORGETOWN AND SYRACUSE ARE EVENLY MATCHED AND DICK VITALE SAYS 
EITHER ONE COULD WIN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
Georgetown and Syracuse. Syracuse and Georgetown. Who can catch a break with 
these guys around? 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale, prominent sage, ESPN broadcaster and sorter-out of the national 
college basketball powers, calls them "1A and 1B in the Big East Conference. In 
players, one to 12, Syracuse is the most talented team in the country. But 
these are great teams and either one could win the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody doesn't like Vitale's television style, but his basketball knowledge 
seldom is called into question. 
</P>
<P>
But next time, ask him a tough one, will you? You don't have to be a walking, 
fast-talking vault of knowledge to draw the same conclusions. You need know 
only that basketball is round in shape and orange in color. This season is no 
different than most others. The nine coaches of the Big East Conference, which 
is very big and mostly east, voted Georgetown first (or 1A if you prefer) and 
Syracuse second (1B) in the annual exercise in appealing nonsense, the 
preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a clear demarcation between those two (the Hoyas and Orangemen) and 
the others," agreed Coach Jim Calhoun of the University of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
So what's new? But just for fun and exercise, not to mention money, they're 
going to play the season anyway, remembering that one of the seven Others 
Brothers, Seton Hall, made the Final Two last year. 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the way things go down every November when the conference holds its 
elaborate kickoff news conference in two large rooms at the Grand Hyatt? Of 
course. It happens so often that Coach John Thompson of Georgetown says he 
expects it and accepts it and "we do take pride in it." 
</P>
<P>
As always, Thompson and Coach Jim Boeheim of Syracuse sat at their tables with 
the largest contingents of writers and broadcasters bunching in front of them, 
straining to hear them remind people they are just as vulnerable as the next 
team. They speak softly (on purpose, I think; why can't they yell, like 
Vitale?), answering the same questions for first one congested clot of newsmen 
and then the next. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, they'll tell you something you suspected, but didn't know for 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
This from Thompson, for example: "Dwayne Bryant and Mark Tillmon are the best 
combination of two guards that have ever played for Georgetown. They are quick, 
strong, alert, effective. As good as any I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
That says plenty. John Thompson has had so many great backcourters you couldn't 
fit all their names on the back of a Big East poster in fine print. But he's 
also a man who weighs his words carefully when speaking publicly about his 
team, especially in the preseason. Hey, maybe he wants the two seniors to read 
the papers before the shooting starts. Maybe he hopes they'll see in print that 
he's counting on them not only for scoring and dishing and directing on the 
floor, but for the kind of leadership that is rewarded in championships. 
</P>
<P>
It is his two mammoth sophomores, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, who get 
most of the attention when the name Georgetown comes up, and it always comes up 
in the same breath as the term college basketball. Mourning and Mutombo 
comprise 14 feet (exactly, if laid end to end) of mountainous talent. No player 
in the nation got more publicity per inch than Mourning last year. Only 18, he 
seemed to thrive on it. Few freshmen would have handled it as well. 
</P>
<P>
"He is mature," Thompson agreed, "but I think there are a lot of things he's 
got to learn. But I think Alonzo presents himself differently in a lot of ways. 
. . . I don't think he's as mature in some ways as he gives the air of being 
and that's good. I would worry about him if he came right out of high school 
and knew everything and was as composed as a senior." 
</P>
<P>
So the old guards will guard the kids against the snares and snafus that often 
entrap the young. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Smith was a good leader," Tillmon noted later, addressing the 
responsibilities of leadership. "By his actions on the court -- not verbally. 
You do your talking in practice. That's what it's for. This is no big ego thing 
for us, and we don't worry about what people say in the preseason. All that 
matters is what happens in the end. Look at Seton Hall last year." 
</P>
<P>
"I think people step up and adjust," Thompson said. "Charlie Smith (last 
season's Big East player of the year) was not always a dominant point guard. In 
fact, he was a substitute who played very little at one time. Dwayne Bryant and 
Mark Tillmon's time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Across the room, the coach of 1B was speaking about his most exciting and 
interesting player, senior Steve Thompson. Thompson, who is 6-foot-4, played 
off-guard and forward last year and this season is slated to be the point guard 
for the Orange. With Thompson on the outside looking in, and the brilliant big 
man Derrick Coleman on the inside looking out, the Others Brothers know they 
had better look out or they'll all be looking up into an orange-colored sky at 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien is not unhappy to see Thompson moving away 
from the target area. "Thompson does most of his damage around the hoop, so I 
like to see him in the backcourt," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Boeheim countered, "Stevie will wind up doing what he always does. When you're 
on the wing, you only get so many opportunities. In the backcourt, he can do 
more. He's the hardest working player I've ever had. Spends an extra hour and 
one half to two hours every day working on his ball handling and shooting. And 
he's the strongest man on the team. He can bench press more than anyone else. I 
believe Thompson is one of the best-kept secrets in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Not to the Others Brothers he isn't; not in what may be the nation's strongest 
conference in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Or is the Big East the Best of the Big? 
</P>
<P>
Back to Vitale. "I think the Big Ten is the best league only because there are 
more teams in the Big Ten with the potential to win it all," he said. "And here 
I am at the Big East press conference saying that.."

BOSTON'S BIRD STILL SCRAPING OFF THE RUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUNComeback: Celtics' star is finally able to run 
up and down the court without feeling pain in his feet. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LANDOVER, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the parking lot emptied outside, Larry Bird sat in front of his locker 
dressed in gray corduroys, a sweater, one gray sock and one tasseled loafer. 
His other foot was wrapped in an ice pack. All you could see were his toes, as 
long and naked as fingers. 
</P>
<P>
It had not been a particularly good night. The Boston Celtics had lost to the 
Washington Bullets, letting the game get away in the fourth quarter, and Bird 
had scored only two points in the last 21 minutes, missing seven consecutive 
shots as the Bullets pulled away at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he was more than happy to sit in the cramped locker room and answer 
questions. Spending a year on the sidelines had altered his world view. 
</P>
<P>
"I still hate losing these games, but, right now, I'm mostly just happy to be 
playing again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in years, he is running the court without feeling pain in 
his feet, a result of the surgery that caused him to miss all but the first few 
games of last season. His rehabilitation was long and hard -- and successful, 
apparently. "I feel great," he said. "There is no pain. I don't even think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
His basketball rehabilitation is another matter. There were moments Wednesday 
night when it seemed he had never missed a game. A perfect pass to Robert 
Parish on the break. A fade-away 19-footer from the baseline. A fake that 
busted the defense and left Kevin McHale open underneath the basket. But for 
each of those moments, there was another that showed rust. A forced pass. A 
jumper that barely touched the rim. 
</P>
<P>
"My passing and shooting are erratic," said Bird, who missed 17 of 26 shots 
against the Bullets. "I make three or four in a row, then miss three or four in 
a row. I make some bad passing decisions. My rebounding, I think, is good. 
Getting back to playing tough competition night after night, after a year off, 
that is an adjustment. I've gotten better. Hopefully, I'm going to continue to 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
Whether he returns to his original form, at age 32, is one of the big stories 
of the pro basketball season. There are indications that he will. He scored 32 
points in the first game of the season. He hit the game-winning shot in the 
last seconds against Chicago last weekend. Even Wednesday night, the parts of 
his game that troubled him were the ones that should heal with time on the 
court. "Passing, shooting -- timing things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he circles the league drawing ovations at almost every stop. 
Wednesday night was no exception. Not so long ago, Bird was booed from the 
moment he stepped on the floor at the Capital Centre. Wednesday night, he was 
given a warm cheer. It is as if the fans have come to understand they only have 
a few years left to appreciate Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"I have gotten a lot more encouragement than I thought I would," he said. "Got 
that nice ovation tonight. Got nice ovations throughout the exhibition season. 
That's great. That's what you hope for -- to go into enemy territory and be 
respected. It is nice to hear that people understand you have been through a 
tough time." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying those ovations, however, has been a battery of questions that has 
trailed him from stop to stop. How do you feel? Do you think you can get back 
to your old self? Do you feel old? Can you pull the Celtics back up to where 
they were before you were gone? Although he is accommodating and patient every 
night, he clearly, for some reasons, feels affronted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-win situation, basically," he said. "If I miss a shot, people are 
going to say, 'Well, he used to make those.' If a rebound glances off my 
fingernails and goes out of bounds, they are going to say, 'Well, he used to 
get those.' You can't win that fight. The way I look at it, if I don't get a 
lot better, something's wrong. I don't believe in age. If you work hard, you 
aren't going to deteriorate. I'm only 32." 
</P>
<P>
Not making his task any easier is the transitional state of the Celtics. A year 
ago, Bird left a team that had a rookie coach, Jim Rodgers, and for years had 
relied almost solely on its starting lineup. One year later, there is a group 
of new faces, and all are getting a chance to play. Gone are the days of 
ignoring the bench; Rodgers used 11 players in the first 15 minutes Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The message: Bird will not play as much as he once did. He does not complain, 
because he respects Rodgers, but it is clear he is struggling to get 
acclimated. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shooting great in the first quarter, and then I came out, and when I got 
back in I couldn't hit a thing," he said. The inference, of course, was that he 
should have stayed in the game. Oh, well. He understands. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has a lot of potential because of the depth," he said. "The question 
is whether we can play together. Right now, we're trying to find out who plays 
well with who, combinations. It's a learning process, and it takes time. Will 
it happen? You like to think so. If we can play together, we can go all the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
That could be a tad optimistic. The Celtics are shallow in the backcourt and 
old in the frontcourt. McHale does not seem to be the dominating player he used 
to be. Parish is well past his peak, as is Dennis Johnson. The Celtics are a 
team with obvious holes. A healthy Larry Bird brightens the picture 
considerably, of course. He has been known to carry a team by himself. He may 
still have it in him. Just give him time.

TODD BRUNNER IS AT THE TOP AT LEHIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Todd Brunner sat on the bench for three years waiting for his chance. Now, the 
Lehigh quarterback is making the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough waiting, but I knew my senior year, I'd have my shot, and I'd 
have to go out there and just give it my all becasue that would be the only 
shot I'd have," said Brunner, son of Minnesota Vikings offensive backs coach 
John Brunner and a brother of former NFL quarterback Scott Brunner. 
</P>
<P>
In only nine games, the 6-foot-1, 212-pound Brunner has broken 10 Lehigh 
passing and yardage records, and is leading the nation in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner set nine of the school records last Saturday in a 46-30 Colonial League 
loss at Colgate, completing a record 38 of 64 passes for a record 467 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He has thrown for 24 touchdowns, breaking the mark of 23 set by Mike Rieker in 
1977. He also has 3,264 yards total offense, breaking Marty Horn's 1985 record 
of 3,040, to lead NCAA Division I-AA with 362.6 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner has passed for more than 300 yards seven times this season -- three of 
them for more than 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe it," Brunner said of his milestones and the players he 
has surpassed. "I still look up to all those guys and the things they've done. 
I just don't picture myself in a class with them." 
</P>
<P>
He had entered the season wondering if he'd be playing at all. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Hank Small had declared the quarterback job open during spring practice, 
and gave underclassmen Glenn Kempa, Al Snyder and Alan LaPoint a shot. Through 
the summer, the battle narrowed to Kempa and Brunner. 
</P>
<P>
"Kempa came on like a house-on-fire during the summer, and that made me 
nervous," Brunner said. "I had to go out there and not make any mistakes, 
because the littlest mistake and he could take right over." 
</P>
<P>
Small waited until the Monday before the opening game to give Brunner the job, 
citing his "leadership ability." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest improvement in Todd since the beginning of the year has 
been his accuracy," Small said. "It's something that has improved his 
confidence, which, in turn, has improved his ability." 
</P>
<P>
Brunner's attitude showed through last year when he realized he wouldn't get 
much time at quarterback. He volunteered for special teams, making 11 tackles 
-- three in one game. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me feel more a part of the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reckless abandon required of kickoff coverage carried over to Brunner's 
style as a quarterback. Instead of sliding or sprinting out of bounds, he 
typically ends a scramble in a head-on crash with a defender. 
</P>
<P>
He once put a Towson State player out of game, and last week made a crunching 
tackle on a Colgate defender who intercepted one of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys know I'll take a shot and give one if I can," Brunner said. 
</P>
<P>
That style of play led several colleges to recruit Brunner as a linebacker or 
defensive back out of Lawrence High School in Cranbury, N.J. Lehigh coaches 
told him he could compete at quarterback, which helped attract him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the NFL careers of his father and brother Scott, Brunner's brother Jack 
played wide receiver at East Stroudsburg and brother Mark is a sophomore wide 
receiver at West Chester. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike high school, Brunner rarely is reminded of his NFL connections. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott went through the same high school, and I guess a lot of people felt I 
got things there because of him," he said. "Here, people look at me because of 
my performance, not who I am."

FOR ROBINSON, IT WAS A SUMMER OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Robinson fell in love with the '89 Baltimore Orioles, as many of us did. 
But he took that affection a step further than most. He wedded himself to the 
team. He took vows. All that was missing was a ring (Can you still see that 
Gregg Olson curveball, and maybe a ring, too, bouncing away and away and away, 
past Jamie Quirk and into the September mist?). 
</P>
<P>
When the season ended and it came time to determine what to do with the rest of 
his life, Robinson let his heart get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
What he thought he should be doing was pursuing a career in the front office, a 
grown-up job suitable for a man of his years and station. Instead, he 
recommitted to a life of airports and double-knits. 
</P>
<P>
He did it because managing the Orioles last year was so much fun that he 
couldn't imagine doing anything else. And he did it because, let's face it, 
Roland Hemond was coming back as general manager, and what job other than 
manager was of sufficient stature to suit Robinson? Can you picture Robinson 
running somebody's errands? 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it was great news for the Orioles. No one could manage them 
better. That's why he was named Manager of the Year in the American League. If 
the Orioles were a miracle, then Robinson must get at least part credit as 
miracle worker. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orioles weren't simply a miracle of bat and ball. This was a team to 
warm a manager's heart (no easy task, that). This was a team happy to be here, 
composed of youngsters who didn't know any better and a few veterans who did. 
Though I'm a believer that biology is more important than chemistry in sports, 
the Orioles certainly came together in a way that made this season possible. 
</P>
<P>
What may be harder is to replicate that spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be a problem next year," Robinson said by phone from his 
home in Los Angeles. "We know some of the players won't be back next year, and 
every player we bring in, we're going to look long and hard to make sure he 
fits in. We really don't want to ruin the chemistry we had. We don't want to 
disturb that. I think it played a very big part in our success last year." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it did. But next year is bound to be different. First, there is money. 
Many of the young Orioles were paid comparatively little. Next season, most 
will want to be paid much more. Some may get their feelings hurt. You wouldn't 
want to be club president Larry Lucchino or Roland Hemond this winter having to 
negotiate with, say, Jeff Ballard or Mickey Tettleton. 
</P>
<P>
How about Gregg Olson or Craig Worthington or Bob Milacki? Entitle this 
chapter: In which the Kiddie Korps Goes to the Bank. It could be a long, hot 
winter, and, come spring, everyone will be busy comparing -- and not just their 
California tans. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems loom. Last year, in the rebuilding process, Robinson was 
determined to play everyone. This was from the look-see school of managing. The 
idea was you either played your way on the team or played you way off (the 
look, see-you-later school). Next season, some of those positions may harden. 
Next year, some of the people who started last season could lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Orioles enjoyed a free ride last season. At the start of the 
season, no one expected anything beyond the team showing up as scheduled. As 
the season progressed, fans could hope for a division title but couldn't 
reasonably expect one. The Orioles' second-place finish was the stuff of fancy 
and, for Baltimore, a summer of love. 
</P>
<P>
There's another problem. Next year, the Orioles will be expected, fairly or 
not, to contend. Although the Orioles could well slip next season -- they're 
still young and they still have more than a few holes to fill -- there will be 
no free ride. What there will be is heightened scrutiny and attendant pressure. 
What the Orioles are being asked to do, in effect, is repeat, as if they won 
something last season, which, I guess, they did. They won back their 
self-respect, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
For Robinson, who is spending his off-season at what must sometimes seem like a 
3,000-mile-long banquet table, next season is the real challenge, and Wednesday 
he was already trying to downplay the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell the players that we are still in the building years," 
Robinson said. "We are still in the situation where we're trying to rebuild the 
organization. I'll tell them not to put any more pressure on themselves than 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
But then, just when Robinson was saying all the right things, he got caught up 
in the summer of '89 and dropped this little bombshell for the summer of '90: 
</P>
<P>
"We're just looking to improve maybe 10 ball games." 
</P>
<P>
That would be 97 wins, of course. And another miracle. And another Manager of 
the Year award -- at the very least.

ONLY COWBOYS KEEP JETS FROM BEING NFL'S BIGGEST JOKE IN '89

<P>
The New York Jets (2-7) entered this season bubbling with optimism, but a 
hopeless offense and inconsistent defense has left Coach Joe Walton's team in 
disarray. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
Ken O'Brien deserves high marks for valor. He's getting pounded more than any 
QB in the league (33 sacks), but somehow he keeps plugging. His performance 
hasn't been O'Brien-like. He has thrown 10 interceptions, three more than last 
season's total. He's averaging one interception per 27.5 attempts, compared 
with last season's 60.6. Incredibly, he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in five 
games, the longest drought of his career. And the offense hasn't scored a TD in 
13 quarters. O'Brien's 72.7 rating is a career low. A weak and injury-ridden 
supporting cast -- including his best receivers -- has contributed to his 
troubles, but O'Brien has hurt himself at times, throwing into double-coverage 
and overthrowing. The major knock is his lack of mobility, but that's nothing 
new. If he doesn't get better protection, O'Brien won't last to the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
The plight of Freeman McNeil symbolizes the entire season. McNeil had his best 
game in Miami, as did the Jets, but he has been in a funk ever since, as have 
the Jets. In the first five games after that win, McNeil rushed for only 143 
yards. Curiously, McNeil's decline coincided with the Colts game Oct. 1, when 
he admittedly lost his composure after putting linebacker O'Brien Alston out 
for the season with a severe knee injury. McNeil (284 yards) is being phased 
out in favor of Johnny Hector (206), who is starting to hit stride after 
missing the first game because of a contract dispute. Fullback Roger Vick has 
been a major disappointment. Vick, who showed promise last season, has gained 
only 27 yards in his past 21 carries. Take away his 39-yard TD run against the 
Browns and he's averaging 2.4 a carry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
By far the most disappointing aspect of the season. The same line that played 
so well late in 1988 requires a total overhaul. The Jets have allowed a 
league-high 35 sacks, including 19 in the past three games. Fourteen sacks have 
occurred on first down, which makes the situation even more alarming. Not only 
is the line committing mental errors, but it's getting physically whipped. 
Center Jim Sweeney, who appeared to be on the verge of Pro Bowl status, has 
been ordinary. Tackles Reggie McElroy and Jeff Criswell have the size coveted 
by the Jets, but they're struggling against speed rushers. Right guard Dan 
Alexander, 34, and left guard Mike Haight aren't playing well, but they've 
suffered from minor injuries. The shame is that right guard Dave Cadigan, last 
season's No. 1 pick, isn't good enough to crack the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
Injuries, injuries, injuries. Al Toon and Wesley Walker haven't played 
together. They've missed a combined 10 games. Tight end Mickey Shuler, the 
leader with 29 receptions, might be finished for the season because of a 
sprained knee. Backups Billy Griggs and Michael Harper also have suffered 
serious injuries. JoJo Townsell (25 catches) is a decent backup, but he doesn't 
have the speed to stretch a defense. Acquiring Chris Burkett was a good move, 
but he's struggling to learn the offense. Talented second-year tight end Keith 
Neubert has been a disappointment, with three drops and one fumble. It's tough 
to grade a group that hasn't played, so the receivers escape with an 
incomplete, which seems only fitting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
Same old story: no pass rush. You hate to say it, but Mark Gastineau probably 
could help. The line has produced only seven sacks. The team has 11, two fewer 
than Keith Millard of the Vikings. Defensive end Paul Frase (2) is the leader, 
and he's not regarded as a pass rusher. The run defense, traditionally a 
strength, also has declined. The past three opponents have rushed for an 
average of 172 yards. Defensive end Marty Lyons, 32, is showing his age. Nose 
tackle Scott Mersereau has the tools, but he's too inconsistent. Nickel pass 
rushers Gerald Nichols and rookie Dennis Byrd have combined for 2 1/2 sacks. 
Rookie defensive end Ron Stallworth, who shined in the preseason, lost his 
starting job after three games. Expect Stallworth, Byrd and fellow rookie 
Marvin Washington to receive more playing time. Why not? There's nothing to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Problems here, too. This group used to be tough against the run, but not 
anymore. In pass coverage, the linebackers are extremely limited because of 
mediocre speed. Kyle Clifton leads in tackles, but he's not fast enough to 
cover backs coming out of the backfield. Troy Benson has been steady since 
reclaiming his job from Kevin McArthur. Where's Alex Gordon? Lots of talent, 
little production. He has 19 solo tackles, a curiously low number for a 
strongside linebacker. No. 1 pick Jeff Lageman got off to a slow start after 
missing most of camp in a contract holdout, but he's starting to come on. He's 
vulnerable to the chop block and his pass rushing needs lots of work, but he 
looks like he'll become a solid player. The Jets were high on third-round pick 
Joe Mott, but he has been used exclusively on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SECONDARY 
</P>
<P>
Where would the Jets be without free safety Erik McMillan? He has four 
interceptions and three TDs, two more TDs than the offense has produced in the 
past five games. He still gets caught out of position, but McMillan deserves to 
go to the Pro Bowl again. Overall, the secondary hasn't shown much improvement 
since 1988. Nineteen TD passes allowed is terrible, but that's partly because 
of no pass rush. A course in remedial tackling would help. Corner back James 
Hasty, slowed by a training-camp injury, is starting to play better after a 
poor start. He has three interceptions. Corner back Bobby Humphery, victimized 
on at least seven TD passes, has struggled at times. Strong safety George 
Radachowsky, replacing injured Rich Miano, is gutsy but limited. Nickel back 
Kerry Glenn has been useful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
How the mighty have fallen. This used to be a formidable group, but injuries 
and personnel changes have disrupted the continuity. The return and coverage 
teams have been below average. Townsell, who led the AFC last season with a 
11.7 punt-return average, is averaging 8.3 yards. The Colts' Clarence Verdin 
returned a punt 49 yards for a TD, the first time in four seasons the Jets have 
allowed a TD runback. Punter Joe Prokop ranks last in the AFC with a 36.6 
average, but he leads the NFL with 17 punts inside the 20. He's as 
unpredictable as the wind at Giants Stadium. Pat Leahy (6-for-9 field goals) 
hasn't had much action because of the mistake-a-minute offense. Linebacker Ken 
Rose leads in tackles by special-teams players. The Jets miss Marion Barber, 
who's on injured reserve with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COACHING 
</P>
<P>
No head coach in the league takes more abuse than Joe Walton, but he doesn't 
deserve all of the blame. He's working for an organization that lacks proper 
structure. Remarkably, Walton has remained upbeat, which has helped prevent 
dissension among the players. On the negative side, Walton doesn't seem to have 
the motivational ability to lift a struggling team. The Jets have been 
outscored in the first half 101-43, which suggests they're not prepared. 
Walton's decision to bench O'Brien in New Orleans was a mistake. The 
play-calling has been predictable. Why did he opt for a field goal on a 
fourth-and-2 from the 49ers' 7-yard line Sunday? The Jets needed a TD; the 
offense needed a confidence booster. Walton needs wins. If the Jets don't 
finish strongly, long-suffering fans may get their wish. It's all up to Boss 
Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OVERALL 
</P>
<P>
The Jets have played two good halves of football: the unsuccessful second-half 
comeback against the Patriots and the stirring second-half comeback against the 
Dolphins. The other halves were lousy until a victory over New England on 
Sunday. Other than McMillan's spectacular play, there's absolutely nothing 
redeeming about the season.

Larry Roeseler drove his Kawasaki motorcycle across the finish line first early 
Friday morning in the 22nd annual Presidente SCORE Baja 1000, as a fatal 
accident marred the off-road race. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Lopez, 10, was killed Thursday night when struck by a racing vehicle 
near San Quintin, 175 miles south of Ensenada, said Mary Caputo, an official of 
the tourist and convention bureau of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
No further details about the accident were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Roeseler, from Irvine, shared the riding duties with Danny LaPorte of Redondo 
Beach, and Ted Hunnicutt Jr., of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Their time was 17 hours 53 minutes 16.3 seconds over the 1,005-mile course 
starting at Ensenada and winding down the Baja Peninsula to La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
They averaged 55.46 m.p.h. over the rugged course. 
</P>
<P>
The first vehicle to cross the finish line was a Ford truck driven by Rob 
Gordon of Irvine, Calif., and co-driver Russ Wernimont of Oceanside, Calif. 
They were clocked in 18:04:07.9, averaging 54.9 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Second among the motorcycles was Scott Morris and Daryl Folks of Las Vegas, on 
a KTM, timed in 17:59:33.3. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place vehicle was a Chenowth driven by Mark McMillan and Donald 
Kenniston of Chula Vista, Calif. They were timed in 19:00:36.1.

BIG EAST BOSS IS SO IMPORTANT MCGUIRE REMEMBERS HIS NAME

<P>
As an athlete, it can be reported, Dave Gavitt was not unforgettable. A case in 
point was his experience as a guard on the Dartmouth College freshman team, 
where he made such a vivid impression that the coach could not remember his 
name. Then again, perhaps that was a reflection on the coach, Al McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
"Al then was like Al now," Gavitt said. "He didn't know anyone's name. I was 
working like hell for two or three games to get into the starting lineup and we 
had a big game against Holy Cross. I must have hit seven or eight jump shots 
and when he pulled me out, he gave me a slap on the back and said, 'Good job, 
George."' 
</P>
<P>
P.S. Gavitt never did start for McGuire, although he later teamed with Rudy 
LaRusso to lead the varsity to Dartmouth's last Ivy League championship. "Now 
(McGuire) kids me about being a short, fat kid with a lot of heart," Gavitt 
said. "I tell him he ruined my career." 
</P>
<P>
But playing was merely an introductory course for Gavitt. He made his mark as a 
coach (five NCAA tournaments, one Final Four in 10 years) and athletic director 
at Providence College, then became one of the most celebrated administrators in 
college sports with the formation of the Big East 10 years ago. As he presided 
over the annual media day in Manhattan last week, the conference's first and 
only commissioner had reason to be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
With Seton Hall's appearance in the NCAA title game last spring, six of the 
nine members qualified for the Final Four during the league's first decade. 
According to its own publicity, the Big East is the nation's most televised 
college basketball conference. Its home attendance, boosted by the massive 
crowds attracted to Syracuse's Carrier Dome, was second highest in the country 
a year ago. And now the first Big East-Atlantic Coast Conference Challenge, 
four doubleheaders staged on consecutive nights in early December, will bring 
additional glory and revenue to Gavitt's creation.

It should be enough to satisfy any man. But Gavitt's preoccupation with the 
sport has carried him beyond the bounds of his own conference. He is completing 
his first year as president of USA Basketball, the national governing body that 
recently reached a historic accommodation with the National Basketball Assn. 
enabling top professionals to represent the United States in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after launching his last jump shot, almost a decade after his 
final coaching assignment with the 1980 U.S. Olympic team was thwarted by a 
boycott, Gavitt has become the nation's No. 1 ambassador of the sport it has 
exported around the world. "For someone from a New Hampshire town of 1,500," 
Gavitt said, "basketball has been incredible to me." 
</P>
<P>
His first exposure to international basketball, he recalled, was a pair of 
encounters against the Australian Olympic team in the early 1970s when Gavitt 
was coaching at Providence. The Aussie coach was Lindsey Gaze, whose son Andrew 
played a major role in Seton Hall's remarkable NCAA tournament effort last 
spring. "I was struck by the different style of play," Gavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
He was struck by more than aesthetics when he took a team of young Americans, 
including Robert Parish, Tree Rollins and Ernie Grunfeld, to Europe in 1975 to 
prepare them for the Pan Am Games. "We played in the outdoor Olympic stadium in 
Greece at 11:30 at night," Gavitt recalled. "There were about 25,000 people 
throwing things at us. It was interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The welcome for U.S. players is far more cordial today. Now the rosters of top 
European teams are sprinkled with Americans, some with NBA experience and 
others, such as Danny Ferry, recruited directly out of college. "The game is 
becoming global," Gavitt noted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's not yet the hot ticket across the pond the way it is here. During a 
recent visit to Italy, Gavitt picked up a national sports daily. "It was a 
40-page paper," he said. "The first 32 pages were devoted to soccer. Basketball 
was on Pages 33 and 34. There were a lot of crowds around 2,000 according to 
the boxscores. There's still a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The man knows about such journeys. When he sold the concept of the Big East to 
other athletic directors in the 1970s, they had little more than their own 
convictions that a union might make it more attractive for a blue-chip recruit 
to stay in the East. The schools had the advantage of location in some major 
media markets and the aid of ESPN, the cable network that was searching for 
programing in its first year. The Monday night package of Big East games 
satisfied the needs of both. 
</P>
<P>
"Television is something we worked hard at," Gavitt said. "We worked to 
understand it, to manage it. We make no apologies for that. In the entire 
1970s, there were only two appearances by Eastern teams on national television. 
I happen to know because I coached in both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Big East is a staple not only of ESPN but of CBS. Additionally, the 
conference established its own TV network in 1985, servicing outlets in major 
Eastern cities. Gavitt has served as an analyst on Big East Network telecasts, 
a role he will continue during the 1989-90 season. Critics have called this a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not working for ESPN or for CBS. It's our own network. And it helps me 
keep close to the kids. I know all the kids here," he said, glancing around the 
hotel ballroom at the athletes as they were being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's important to me. It's still their game, the kids in short pants. We're 
just the caretakers. The idea is to make it as challenging and exciting as we 
can for them." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his college freshman coach, Gavitt makes it a point to remember all the 
names.

NBC CONTRACT WILL PUSH NBA SALARIES HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
NBC took the NBA away from CBS Thursday with a $600 million, four-year contract 
that could push average pro basketball salaries into the $1 million range next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA is in the final season of a four-year, $173 million deal with CBS, 
which refused to meet the league's new pricetag. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big increase, but one I think is justified," NBA commissioner David 
Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes the owners and players very happy," said Charles Grantham, 
executive director of players' union. "We were close to the $1 million per 
player projected when the collective-bargaining agreement was signed" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between the league and the NBA Players Association, 53 
percent of the gross revenues go to player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that for purposes of the salary cap, the contract was evaluated at 
$126 million for 1990-91. Under the formula, the salary cap would rise from 
$9.8 million to at least $11.5 million per team. It would increase even more if 
non-television revenues rise. 
</P>
<P>
The new pact was another example of the price escalation for TV sports and of 
the breakup of traditional alliances between leagues and networks. Baseball, 
which had been on NBC since 1947, goes to CBS starting in 1990 under a 
four-year, $1.06 billion deal. The Olympics, once a domain of ABC, will remain 
on NBC and CBS through at least 1994. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which last broadcast the NBA in 1962, lost its baseball package to CBS 
last December. NBC president Robert C. Wright said Thursday that NBC would not 
have paid that much to keep baseball even if it had known how much the market 
would increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be standing here today if we had that baseball contract hanging 
over our heads," he said at a news conference announcing the NBA deal. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which had broadcast the NBA since the 1973-74 season, had the right to 
exclusive negotiations with the league during October. Stern said CBS was 
offered the same $600 million deal, but turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS regrets the loss of the NBA broadcast rights after an 18-year 
relationship," CBS Sports president Neal H. Pilson said in a statement. 
"However, the increase in the total cost of the package sought by the league 
from $176 million to approximately $650 million for the next four years was 
substantially more than we were prepared to pay. We wish the NBA a successful 
future and extend our congratulations to NBC. We look forward to our coverage 
of the NBA in the 1989-90 season." 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that CBS evaluated certain promotional arrangements with NBC as 
being worth $50 million. He said ABC was offered the package, too, but told the 
league it wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said he expected CBS to renew with 
the NBA and "was unbelievably surprised that this deal came to the street." He 
called the NBA "an unbelievable national success." 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, NBC will show 20 regular-season games. There will be a 
November Sunday broadcast, a Christmas telecast and a regular series of Sunday 
afternoon games beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
NBC will show the All-Star Game and up to 30 playoff games, all in the 
afternoon or prime time. Games 3 and 6 of the NBA finals will be on Sunday 
afternoons and the other games in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, under its contract that expires at the end of the season, televises some 
West Coast games at 11:30 p.m. Eastern time. NBC, however, will have those 
games start during prime time in the East. NBC officials said the request was 
made by the NBA. NBC also has the highly rated "Tonight Show Starring Johnny 
Carson" at 11:30 Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract also means that Marv Albert, the longtime play-by-play voice 
of the New York Knicks and NBC's college basketball coverage, could become the 
top NBA announcer on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a fantasy come true for us to get it," said Albert, who added he 
had no idea if he would be considered for the job. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA will now negotiate a new cable television contract to replace the 
two-year, $50 million deal with Turner Broadcasting Systems that expires at the 
end of the season. Stern said Turner has an exclusive negotiating period 
through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Under Stern's direction, the NBA has made a complete during the 1980s. The 
league's image, hurt by admissions of drug use in the late 1970s, improved with 
a drug agreement between the league and the union. At the same time, stars such 
as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing became the 
high-profile draws needed to fill arenas and raise TV ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA also pushed back the start of its season until November, after the 
completion of the World Series. It also lessened competition with the NFL.

<P>
The L.A. Southwest College football team held Harbor College scoreless in the 
second half of their Western State Conference contest Saturday and capitalized 
on several Seahawk miscues for a 30-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, Southwest improved its record to 7-1-1 (6-1-1 in conference 
play). Harbor fell to 3-6 and 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Harris returned the game's opening kickoff 95 yards for a quick Harbor 
touchdown. The Cougars replied with a 22-yard Jason Thomson field goal. Then, 
after Ahmed Mortis blocked a Seahawk punt, Southwest quarterback Craig Manigo 
hit Damon Beckom with a 10-yard TD pass. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor recovered a fumble at the Cougar 11 and regained the lead, 12-10, when 
Corey Henry plunged in from the one. But Southwest's Beckom caught a 17-yard 
touchdown strike in the third quarter, and Manigo scrambled for two more TDs in 
the fourth. KEN BANKS

LOYOLA OPENS YEAR WITH BIG NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the brink of Loyola Marymount's season opener at Nevada-Las Vegas on 
Wednesday, some trivia about the basketball team: 
</P>
<P>
* Coach Paul Westhead, entering his fifth season, is fourth in career coaching 
wins at Loyola with 79. He needs five victories to move ahead of Scotty 
McDonald into third and 28 to tie William Donovan for first at 107. John Arndt 
is second at 91. At 79-42, Westhead is head and shoulders above the rest in 
winning percentage at .653. Donovan is next closest at .514. 
</P>
<P>
* Gersten Pavilion will be the site of the West Coast Conference Tournament, 
March 3-5. The first three tournaments have all been held in the San Francisco 
Bay area, with Loyola winning the last two. Home-court advantage? No home team 
has won the tournament yet. 
</P>
<P>
* Under Westhead, Loyola's offense has increased 64%, from 68.5 points per game 
the season before Westhead was hired to 112.5 last season, the NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
* Barring injury, Loyola's high-scoring triumvirate of seniors, Hank Gathers, 
Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, should rewrite most of the school record book. 
Gathers, who has scored 1,969 points in his college career (including 233 as a 
freshman at USC), needs 325 points to supplant Forrest McKenzie (2,060 points) 
as the Loyola career scoring leader. Gathers already owns the two best 
single-season totals in school history -- 1,015 last season and 721 the year 
before. With 1,286 career points, Fryer, who has the third-best single season 
of 710, needs 13 to move into the career top 10 and 315 to move into the top 
five. Kimble, with 879 points despite missing 19 games in his Loyola career, 
needs 420 points to move into the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding last season, needs 122 
rebounds to move past Mark Armstrong into second place, and 458 to pass Jim 
Haderlein's career mark of 1,161. Last season he got 426. Gathers needs 31 
points and 296 rebounds to join a select group of collegians to get 2,000 
points and 1,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
* More Gathers: The WCC's most valuable player as a junior is trying to become 
the 10th player in conference history to repeat. He would join a distinguished 
list: Ken Sears of Santa Clara (1953, '55), Mike Farmer of USF (1957-58), Leroy 
Wright of Pacific (1957, '59) Steve Gray of St. Mary's (1962-63), Ollie Johnson 
of USF (1964-65), Dennis Awtrey of Santa Clara (1969-70), Bill Cartwright of 
USF (1977-78-79), Quintin Dailey of USF (1981-82) and Dwayne Polee of 
Pepperdine (1985-86). (Note: in several years, players have shared the award). 
Notice a missing name? Bill Russell, who led USF to national titles in 1955 and 
'56, was beaten out by Sears for 1955 MVP honors before winning the award in 
1956. 
</P>
<P>
* Fryer has attempted (632) and made (242) more three-pointers in his career 
than two-pointers (405-179). Last season he led the nation in three-pointers 
made (128) and was third in the country in three-pointers per game (4.1 
average).

MIRALESTE PLAYOFF HOPES DWINDLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Miraleste High School's football team lost, 41-21, to visiting Whittier 
Christian on Saturday and saw its hope of an at-large berth in the Southern 
Section Division IX playoffs fade. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll be in the playoffs," Coach Todd DeAngelis said of his 
Marauders, who finished the season 5-4 (3-3 in the Olympic League). 
</P>
<P>
Injured Miraleste tailback Dan Sarner rushed for 130 yards in 11 carries, 
including an 80-yard TD run, and caught two passes for 78 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders held Whittier Christian fullback Ron Papazian to 77 yards, but 
tailback Scott Jordan had 200 yards in 31 carries and two touchdowns. 
Quarterback Nick Sanchez hit flanker Alex Davila for 109 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic League is guaranteed only two playoff berths in Division IX, and 
those are going to Whittier Christian (10-0, 6-0) and Valley Christian (9-1, 
5-1). For Miraleste to get in, Southern Section officials would have to tag 
both the league's third-place team, Santa Margarita (7-3, 6-2), and Miraleste 
as at-large selections. STUART MATTHEWS

MIRALESTE WATER POLO TEAM ADVANCES IN CIF 2-A PLAYOFFS

Miraleste High advanced to the quarterfinals of the CIF Southern Section 2-A 
water polo playoffs Saturday by beating an aggressive Alhambra team, 16-14, at 
Alhambra Park. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, 21-5, will face the winner of the Cabrillo-San Marino match Tuesday 
at a site to be determined. Alhambra, the Foothill League champions, ended the 
year 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra's Rolando Rojas scored to give the Moors a 1-0 lead, but then 
Miraleste scored six unanswered goals, including two by Brian Johnston, to take 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste led 7-4 after two quarters, but goals by Alhambra's Victor Arrelano 
and Sandor Poka narrowed the lead to 7-6 with 3:35 to go in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste led by two goals six times after that, but Alhambra kept coming back. 
"We need to improve on defense," Miraleste Coach Chick McIlroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste finally scored two goals in a row in the fourth quarter, when Zoltan 
Gyurko and Andy Foster scored with 3:20 and 3:02 left, making the score 14-11. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra trimmed the lead to two, but late goals by Gyurko and Brad Youngren 
secured the win. 
</P>
<P>
McIlroy said Alhambra's tenacity forced his players to work harder. "Our guys 
realized they were in the playoffs," he said. 
</P>

Miraleste's Kyle Hildebrand led all scorers with six goals. GREG GONZALEZ

AIRPORT LAND-USE LAW GETS TEETH; 
</P>
<P>
COMPLIANCE: LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICIALS CONTEND LAW TO CONTROL BUILDING TOO 
VAGUE, MAY SEEK LEGAL OPINION FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, many local governments in California have ignored a 1970 law that 
requires detailed land-use plans around large airports. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the law was broadened in 1984 to include most of the state's 
airports, many local governments failed to comply. 
</P>
<P>
But now, legislative staffers and airport officials say, a new law that puts 
teeth into the earlier statutes could curb development of hotels, homes and 
industrial parks around such airports as Los Angeles International and San 
Diego's Lindbergh Field, where no plans have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation officials estimate that plans have been completed for only 
57% of the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the poor compliance record, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
last summer easily won passage of a bill -- which becomes law Jan. 1 -- to add 
a significant new step to ensure that developments are compatible with 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, if an airport does not have a plan, most construction projects 
-- possibly as far away as 2 miles from airports -- will need approval from 
county airport land-use commissions as well as local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The developments still could get the green light but "only under very limited 
conditions" until comprehensive land-use plans are finished, according to a 
fact sheet on the law prepared by Bergeson's Senate Local Government Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The law sets a June 30, 1991 deadline for completion of the master plans. But 
Los Angeles County officials are questioning whether the law applies to them 
because of vague wording -- an assertion disputed by Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative aides said the 1970 law directed the Regional Planning Commission 
to conduct the airport land-use study for Los Angeles County. But county 
officials say the section of the law that applies just to Los Angeles may be so 
vague that it exempts the county. 
</P>
<P>
A clarifying opinion may be sought from Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, said 
John Huttinger, a planner with the Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Commission. But in the meantime, Huttinger said, he making plans to enforce the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the Legislature decided that the largest county in the state 
should be exempt from this law," said Fred Stewart, who oversees planning for 
Caltrans' aeronautics division. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she was surprised by the county's reaction, maintaining that such 
questions were not raised during legislative hearings. It's "rather bewildering 
that would occur now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Not complying with the law has resulted in the "erection of skyscrapers, radio 
towers and other tall structures in dangerously close proximity to our 
airports," according to Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), a pilot who supported the Bergeson 
law, said it was long overdue because cities "continue to let this rapid 
development go unchecked around these airports." 
</P>
<P>
The law has airport managers and planners scrambling to determine its impact on 
commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
No plans have been completed for any of the 16 airports in Los Angeles County, 
according to state transportation officials. As a result, airport managers in 
the county predict some construction delays, but say it is too early to tell 
whether the law will affect any major projects -- such as a 400-acre 
development on the north side of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prepared to tell you now whether we have a problem or not," said Bill 
Schoenfeld, deputy executive director of the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, a plan has been completed, so officials 
say that the county's airport land-use commission will not get final authority 
to make planning decisions there. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, a study of Lindbergh Field has not been completed, according to 
Jack Koerper, special projects director for the San Diego Assn. of Governments, 
which has responsibility for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Koerper could not say what projects around Lindbergh Field might be affected. 
Earlier this year, the San Diego City Council approved construction of a 
10-story office building 80 feet north of the approach corridor -- a proposal 
that aroused concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Planners in Los Angeles County suggested that most airports in the county are 
in heavily urbanized areas and won't be affected. However, they said that among 
the developments that could be affected are a controversial proposal to build 
52 homes and an office building under the departure pattern at Torrance 
Municipal Airport and the possible addition of high-rises in Century City under 
the Santa Monica Airport flight path. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, the new law is expected to delay projects around airports. "The 
potential is certainly there for an overwhelming change" in the way airport 
hotels, industrial parks and other commercial structures are approved, 
Huttinger said. 
</P>
<P>
While the law is vague on the area for which a plan must be completed, 
Bergeson's committee says it would be within a 2-mile radius of airports. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Legislature began wrestling with the issue of growth around 
airports as land was gobbled up for homes, hotels and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
By 1970, it required land-use studies around large airports with commercial 
service. That requirement was extended to most of the state's general aviation 
airports in 1984. But many counties ignored it, citing a lack of funds and a 
failure of the Legislature to provide a deadline for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Van de Kamp's office said the only way to force the adoption of 
land-use plans would be a lawsuit to stop all development near an airport until 
local officials complied with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bergeson's law such lawsuits could not be filed until land-use plans are 
adopted or until June 30, 1991, when the law mandates that such plans be 
completed.

STEADY RATES, SLOW SALES ARE A BOON FOR BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: SELLERS ARE MORE WILLING TO TRIM THEIR PRICES AS THE MARKET CONTINUES 
TO SOFTEN.

<P>
If you're thinking of taking out a loan to either buy a new home or refinance 
your current one, here's some good news: Most economists say today's low 
mortgage rates won't be going up much in the near future, and some even say 
that rates will drop. 
</P>
<P>
The rosy interest-rate picture gives would-be buyers even more clout when they 
go shopping for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
The once-sizzling market has recently turned soft, with sales dropping in many 
parts of the state and across the nation. Sellers have become more willing to 
cut their asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the upward pressure on interest rates apparently over for the time 
being, buyers have one more reason to take their time house hunting and perhaps 
drive even harder bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is slowing down, and there just isn't much inflation to worry 
about," said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage 
Assn. in Washington, D.C. "There's no real reason to think interest rates are 
going to go up over the next few months." 
</P>
<P>
A cooling economy eases inflationary pressures and, typically, pushes mortgage 
rates down. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates peaked last spring, when 30-year fixed-rate loans topped 11%. 
They have since floated back down to about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Berson and some other economists say rates may fall even lower -- perhaps 
as low as 9 1/2% -- before starting another upward march early next next year. 
</P>
<P>
The interest-rate dip has already sparked a mad dash for fixed-rate loans, 
mortgages that were out of favor when interest rates topped 11% earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our adjustable-rate mortgage business is virtually non-existent," said Howard 
Levine, president of ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Calabasas. "When fixed-rate loans 
are as low as they are today, there's just no reason why consumers should take 
out an ARM." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if you're thinking about buying a home, most experts say it probably 
won't be worthwhile to delay your plans in the hope of getting a much lower 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
ARCS Mortgage and several other lenders are already offering 30-year fixed-rate 
loans at 9 3/4%. On a $150,000 loan, monthly interest and principal payments 
would be $1,289. 
</P>
<P>
If rates drop to 9 1/2%, payments on the loan would drop to $1,261 -- only $28 
a month lower. 
</P>
<P>
"If prices go up just one-half percent a month, the higher price you pay for 
the property will wipe out any savings from the lower rate," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
People who are thinking of refinancing may want to wait a few more weeks to see 
if rates drop a bit further, but that means taking a risk that the economists 
are wrong and that rates will go up. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether you're buying a home or refinancing, you'll want to see 
if your lender will let you "lock-in" today's low rates. 
</P>
<P>
If you get a lock-in clause, the lender will agree to give you the same 
interest rate even if mortgages rates rise between the time your completed loan 
application is accepted and the time the money is advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Some lenders will let you lock in their current rates for 30 days, while others 
provide 60 and even 75-day guarantees. Some institutions will charge you 
several hundred dollars for the lock-in clause, while others provide the 
guarantee for free. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also want to ask the lender what will happen if you apply for a loan and 
interest rates drop before your application is processed. A few lenders will 
give you the lower rate if that happens, but most will require that you take 
the interest rate that was in effect when you turned in your application. 
</P>
<P>
One other tip: If a loan officer promises you that the rate you're quoted is 
the rate you'll get, make sure that promise is in writing. As the late movie 
mogul Samuel Goldwyn once said, "a verbal agreement isn't worth the paper it's 
written on."

YOUR MORTGAGE;

<P>
DON'T PAY HOME LOAN WITH A MONEY ORDER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Two months ago, my out-of-state mortgage company claimed they did not 
receive my mortgage payment. They sent me a nasty computerized late notice 
demanding my payment plus a $49 late charge. But I have a perfect on-time 
payment record and they know it, so there was no reason to get nasty. 
</P>
<P>
I contacted the grocery store where I bought the money order for the mortgage 
payment but the manager says it will take at least two months to trace if the 
money order has been cashed. 
</P>
<P>
When I sent in my payment for last month's mortgage payment, the mortgage 
company sent it back with a rude letter, refusing to accept it because they 
claim I still owe the payment for two months ago plus the $49 late charge. 
</P>
<P>
This lender doesn't have an 800 toll-free phone number and when I try to call 
them I always get a busy signal. Yesterday, they sent me a notice giving me 10 
days to pay or they will begin foreclosure. What can I do to clear up this 
mess? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: In the future, never, never, never make important payments by money 
order. As you discovered, tracing a money order is virtually impossible. 
Incidentally, I repeatedly warn my tenants not to pay rent with money orders 
but they keep doing it. Get a checking account so you can control your 
finances. Not having a personal checking account is extremely foolish. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, you've got to talk to a supervisor or officer with the mortgage 
company. Perhaps if you call information in the distant city you can get 
another phone number for the lender that isn't always busy. Work out an 
arrangement to pay the two missing payments. Most lenders will waive a late 
charge if you are forceful. Emphasize your excellent payment record. 
</P>
<P>
You should know that lenders earn millions of dollars in late payment fees, so 
they are eager to claim loan payments were received late. To prevent your 
problem from reoccurring, after you get your personal checking account, send 
your lender 12 post-dated checks for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Enclose a letter explaining you want no more hassles and send it via certified 
mail with a return receipt. I've used this tactic with several nasty loan 
servicers and have had no further attempts to extort late charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Lenders More Flexible Than Others 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are frustrated prospective home buyers. We have saved 
almost $20,000 for a down payment and our parents will help us with any 
additional amount we might need. But our problem is qualifying for a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
We talked to a loan officer at the S&amp;L where we have our savings and 
checking accounts. She said we don't earn enough income. But we pay our bills 
in full each month and only have one installment loan for our car and it will 
be paid off in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
We were so proud of ourselves for saving almost $20,000 in just a few years, 
but when the loan officer said we couldn't get a large enough loan to buy the 
home a local realty agent had shown us we were heartbroken. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You were probably talking to the wrong lender. There are "good guy" and 
"bad guy" lenders. The "bad guy" lenders are inflexible and require their 
mortgage borrowers to meet the tough, unreasonable loan standards of the big 
secondary mortgage market buyers such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
You were probably talking to such a lender. For example, if your loan payments 
will take over 28% of your gross income, Fannie and Freddie don't want to buy 
your loan. I'd like to know where they got that low percentage. Borrowers in 
circumstances like yours can obviously afford to pay more of their income for 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
But the "good guy" lenders are the flexible portfolio lenders or the lenders 
who sell their loans to more reasonable secondary market buyers such as pension 
plans and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio lenders, including some of the nation's largest loan originators, 
keep mortgages in their loan portfolios several years to "season" it. Then the 
lender may sell it after you have established a solid payment record. 
</P>
<P>
Some flexible portfolio lenders will approve home loans where payments take up 
to 50% of gross income when the borrower has good credit, good income and few 
debts.

BRADBURY BUILDING RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bradbury Building, Los Angeles' oldest historical landmark structure, is 
undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation and restoration. 
</P>
<P>
According to new owner Sydney Irmas, who purchased the 96-year-old 
office/retail structure from Western Management last April, the rehab project 
will be completed by next summer. The project architect is Brenda Levin of 
Levin &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradbury Building, located at 3rd Street and Broadway, consists of 10,000 
square feet of ground-floor retail and arcade space and another 60,000 square 
feet of office use. Its interior features include open-caged elevators, a 
glass-canopied court, detailed ironwork stair rails and flights of open 
stairways. 
</P>
<P>
Following completion, Irmas plans to dedicate and market the building as the 
architectural headquarters of Los Angeles. Managing the property, as well as 
overseeing the construction will be Cushman &amp; Wakefield of California's 
Management Services Group.

REUNIFICATION OF 2 GERMANYS NOT A TOPIC, KRENZ SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: HE AND KOHL PLAN TO MEET SOON. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FLOOD INTO WEST 
BERLIN FROM ACROSS THE WALL. 
</P>

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared Saturday that he will soon meet 
with new East German leader Egon Krenz, with Krenz insisting that reunification 
of divided Germany will "not be on the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of East Germans flooded into West Berlin, 
turning the city center into one enormous pedestrian mall. 
</P>
<P>
And Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a message to President Bush on 
Saturday declaring his support of the East German move to open its border with 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Kohl said he told Krenz during a telephone conversation Saturday that 
he welcomes the Communist regime's decision Thursday to open the tightly 
guarded frontier. The two are expected to meet later this month or in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Krenz said of the coming meeting: "I made no secret of the 
fact that the question of reunification is not up for discussion at all. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern as a representative of East Germany is to stress there are two 
sovereign German states that must get along well with each other, and I will do 
my best to make sure that this will work even better." 
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Kohl and Krenz are expected to discuss the West German 
chancellor's offer to provide massive economic aid if the new Communist regime 
carries out promised free elections and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Following his conversation with Krenz, Kohl told a news conference the two 
agreed to discuss how to improve conditions in East Germany "so that they can 
feel comfortable in their homeland and not want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I expressly told (Krenz) that it is the goal of our policy that people are 
able to remain in their homelands," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl met Krenz's ousted predecessor, Erich Honecker, in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After speaking with Krenz, Kohl flew to Warsaw to resume his official visit to 
Poland that was interrupted by last week's startling turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
All along the two nations' border Saturday, lines of cars many miles long 
waited to cross directly into West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials said Saturday that 1.6 million East Germans had been 
issued travel visas since Thursday. But West German Interior Minister Wolfgang 
Schaeuble said that of the hundreds of thousands who had entered since about 9 
p.m. Thursday, only about 5% said they wished to remain. 
</P>
<P>
All day and evening Saturday, East Germans strolled the streets of West Berlin 
and West German cities, usually carrying plastic bags donated by supermarkets 
to haul what they could afford in the shops. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, the visitors were easily recognizable among the more formally 
dressed West Berliners taking their Saturday coffee-and-cakes because of their 
casual dress -- invariably blue-gray jackets and stone-washed jeans and white 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of thousands of family groups was lighthearted but quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The main exception was an incident at the Brandenburg Gate that stands in East 
Berlin just beyond the wall. 
</P>
<P>
There, young people from West Berlin climbed on the wall, which lies in East 
German territory, and taunted the guards with calls for total destruction of 
the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
They smashed a hole in the concrete, and the guards responded with a burst of 
water cannon. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Eberswald Street border crossing, East German crews using a crane 
worked all night to remove concrete wall sections. By early morning, they were 
busy putting the finishing touches on a ramp for cars and pedestrians to use. 
</P>
<P>
Another construction crew was hard at work Saturday preparing the way for a 
major new crossing at Potsdamerplatz, once the busiest intersection in Europe 
until extinguished by war and the wall running across it. 
</P>
<P>
On the West side, an asphalt road, still steaming, was being laid to connect 
with the Berlin network, and similar measures were being undertaken behind the 
wall -- which itself will soon be breached. 
</P>
<P>
An East German border guard at the Eberswald crossing told reporters Saturday 
morning: "It was a beautiful moment when the first people walked through. Now 
we are turning this into just a normal street." 
</P>
<P>
The gap in the wall was clearly marked because the graffiti on the West side 
abruptly ended -- replaced by the bare, gray interior walls of the East Berlin 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece of graffiti read in English: "Mom, why is this wall here?" 
</P>
<P>
An East German construction engineer, Peter Niekamp, who by virtue of 
membership in the Communist Party was able to visit relatives in San Francisco 
a week before that city's earthquake, observed: "We're having our own 
earthquake here, but it's a good one. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to imagine this happening a few weeks ago, really impossible." 
</P>
<P>
As he watched the mass of people swarm by, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"We have some very big problems in our very small country, and I hope that all 
these people will come back. 
</P>
<P>
After the East Germans moved through the new gap in the wall, they walked a 
block down the street, where they were greeted by an A&amp;P supermarket van. 
Willing helpers passed out plastic bags with a pound of coffee and a large bar 
of chocolate, precious items in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients were supposed to show East German identity cards, but nobody was 
checking. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the street, at a main intersection, East Germans stood in long 
lines outside several branch banks, specially opened on Saturday, to receive 
the traditional "welcome gift" of 100 marks (about $60) that the city hands out 
to German visitors from the East. They waited three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people feel ashamed about accepting this," said a West Berliner who 
talked with some of the East Berliners. "But their own marks are worth only a 
tenth of the West mark, so they would have a hard time buying anything here, 
even a cheap meal." 
</P>
<P>
The famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra announced a free concert with 
conductor Daniel Barenboim, and the West German Opera here presented a free 
performance of "The Magic Flute." 
</P>
<P>
Another performance was held at the Friedrichstrasse crossing point. There, 
world-renowned Soviet-born cellist Mstislav Rostropovic gave an impromptu 
concert in front of a graffiti-covered section of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
And on bustling Wuerttembergerische Strasse a 24-year-old visitor from Potsdam, 
East Germany, gave birth to a girl on the sidewalk, police reported.

Rides on the subways and elevated trains were free, as were city buses, which 
were implemented by tour coaches and buses from Hamburg city. 
</P>
<P>
Inching up in the queue outside a bank off the main Kurfuerstendamm avenue, a 
family of four adults, all medical workers from Leipzig, were cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
One, Annette Schultz, explained that they had taken one of several special 
trains from East Germany's second-largest city at 2 a.m.. Saturday, arriving in 
Berlin at 7 a.m. and crossing the wall. 
</P>
<P>
They were looking forward to a day of shopping -- or at least window shopping 
-- because the lack of goods is what has driven many people in the Leipzig, 
Karl Marx Stadt and Dresden area to flee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience so far been beautiful; the city much cleaner than Leipzig with 
fine public transport. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be going back tonight," she said. "I don't think many people will stay 
over here permanently. We would like to come back again soon."

CHILDREN WHO DRESS FOR EXCESS; 
</P>

TODAY'S YOUNGSTERS HAVE BECOME FIXATED WITH FASHION. THE RIGHT LOOK ISN'T 
ENOUGH -- IT ALSO HAS TO BE EXPENSIVE.

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When 15-year-old Michael Thomas left home for school last May, he couldn't have 
been prouder. On his feet, thanks to his mother's hard work, were a pair of 
spanking new Air Jordans -- $100 worth of leather, rubber and status that to 
today's youth are the Mercedes-Benzes of athletic footwear. 
</P>
<P>
The next day it was James David Martin, 17, who was strolling down the street 
in Thomas' new sneakers, while Thomas lay dead in a field not far from his 
school. Martin was arrested for murder. 
</P>
<P>
For the Baltimore school system, Thomas' death was the last straw. He was the 
third youngster to have been killed over his clothes in five years. Scores of 
others had been robbed of name-brand sneakers, designer jogging suits, leather 
jackets and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the school board instituted an exclusionary dress code. Devised by 
parents, students and educators, it prohibits leather skirts and jackets, 
jogging suits, gold chains and other expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
Clothes, said board president Joseph Smith, had just gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, parents, school officials, psychologists and even some 
children agree. 
</P>
<P>
They say that today's youngsters, from New York's poverty-ridden South Bronx to 
Beverly Hills, have become clothes fixated. They worry over them, compete over 
them, neglect school for them and sometimes even rob and kill for them. 
</P>
<P>
This obsession with clothing, say those who study it, is fueled by the visual 
media and advertising, is nurtured by overindulgent parents and is reinforced 
by youthful peer pressure and the child's overriding desire to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
And, they note, the clothing industry is using advertising to court today's 
youngsters at a younger age and with much greater intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these people understand something that is very basic and logical, that 
if you own this child at an early age, you can own this child for years to 
come," said Mike Searles, president of Kids 'R' Us, a chain of specialty 
children's stores. "Companies are saying, 'Hey, I want to own the kid younger 
and younger and younger.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as early as age 4, many of today's children embark on a frenetic quest 
for the right clothes with the right style and the right name in order to 
maintain the right look. 
</P>
<P>
For schoolchildren, clothes no longer represent just good grooming; they have 
become symbols of status, indicators of wealth and a passport into the 
mainstream of today's childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen that to today's kids, the clothes and footwear are a sense of who 
they are," said Betty Richardson, vice president of marketing for Reebok. "They 
represent what they think to be special and what they think to be important to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
And what is important, youngsters say, are name brands -- Nike, Reebok, L.A. 
Gear, Guess, Bugle Boy, Jimmy Z, Cavarrichi, Edwins, Benetton, Esprit, Public 
Image, Gitano, Jordache, Ultra Pink and dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
They wear the names like badges of honor. Show up for school without them, 
students say, and they may be ridiculed, scorned and sometimes even ostracized 
by their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"When people look at you and you're not wearing something that has a name 
brand, they'll comment on it," said Aime Lorenzo, an 11th grader at Beach High 
School in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"People will tease you and talk about you, say you got on no-name shoes or say 
you shop at K mart," said Darion Sawyer, 10, of Tench Tillman Elementary School 
in Baltimore. Children have developed derisive nicknames for non-name brands -- 
"bo bos, no names and fish heads." 
</P>
<P>
One group of Miami sixth-graders have even developed a sarcastic couplet: "Bo 
bos cost $1.99. Bo bos make your feet feel fine." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters, naturally, try to avoid such taunting. Jessica Hoffman, 11, spent 
three hours earlier this year trying to decide what to wear for her first day 
at Walter Reed Junior High School in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds stupid," she said, "but what I was worried about was whether people 
would like what I was wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Schoolmate Tim Baca picked out his first-day outfit three days before school 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are very few people who dress for themselves," Shelly Ann 
Gouldborne, a Miami High School student, said of her contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Educators complain that because of such attention to attire, schools from the 
elementary level to high school have become fashion shows as students try to 
either outdo each other or just keep up with rapidly changing trends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen kids come in with wallets and purses that must be well over $100, 
and I can't figure out why a kid would spend that much money," said Alan 
Joseffberg, counselor at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. "And they all have 
to have a label on their jeans." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Davis, a teacher at a middle school in one of Miami's poorer 
neighborhoods, said as a class exercise he and his class priced the clothes one 
student was wearing. It came to $180. 
</P>
<P>
"And that was just for one day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, students are so concerned about what they and their classmates 
are wearing, they forget what they came to school for, educators said. Teasing 
and arguments over clothes, particularly at the elementary level, result in 
fights and disruptions. On the high school level, counselors report that more 
and more students are working, often so they can keep up their wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is spending huge amounts on clothes and the kids who can't afford it 
-- instead of doing homework and studying -- are taking jobs after school just 
to buy designer jeans," said Patrick Welsh, a high school English teacher in 
Washington, D.C. "It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
In response, scores of public schools, mainly in Eastern cities, have 
voluntarily adopted school uniforms to cut down on competition. Paradoxically, 
educators say, in the current fashion climate, dressing students alike allows 
them greater freedom to be individuals. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, parents complain that their children are pressing to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter wants the $60 pair of jeans, but we're a $30 household," said Pat 
Anderson, who lives in Geneva, Ill., just outside Chicago. "Maybe if we had a 
$300,000-a-year income, that would be fine. But we're on a limited budget and 
there's no way we can afford this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"Money is always a battle," said Char Christian, who lives in the Chicago 
suburb of Hinsdale. "I am torn trying to determine the difference between what 
she needs and what she wants." 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful," said Lissa Thompson of Orange County, the mother of two 
daughters. "It bothers me that children who are so young -- 7 and 9 -- are 
aware of things that are so unimportant. Don't get me wrong, I like nice 
clothes too, but I think there's a time and a place to be a kid. This is no 
time for them to be preoccupied with what you put on every day." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists say that an interest in trends and fashion, particularly at the 
older ages, is just a part of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this whole clothes business has to do with a normal developmental 
process," said Maryland psychologist Andrea Vanderpool, "but I think it takes 
on a more dangerous kind of aura when you see the lengths that these kids have 
to go to to look like everybody else and how the kids who don't look like 
everybody else are treated." 
</P>
<P>
For clothing models, children look increasingly to the visual media -- 
television, video and even movies. And, advertising executives say, there is no 
group more susceptible to advertising than youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Shalek, president of Shalek Advertising Agency, which has handled 
accounts for a number of children's clothing lines, is also a mother who is 
concerned about the effect of advertising on today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising at its best is making people feel that without their product, 
you're a loser," she said. "Kids are very sensitive to that. If you tell them 
to buy something, they are resistant. But if you tell them they'll be a dork if 
they don't, you've got their attention. You open up emotional vulnerabilities 
and it's very easy to do with kids because they're the most emotionally 
vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Peer pressure can also be a powerful force. 
</P>
<P>
One result is readily apparent in the shopping cycle. Stores say the two 
biggest shopping periods for school clothes are the week before school begins 
and the week after school begins. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids go to school and they find out somebody is wearing Reebok instead of 
Nike or acid-washed jeans instead of tapered," Searles said. "So the desire to 
fit in drives to more purchases that are totally peer-related." 
</P>
<P>
But, observers say, parents can also unwittingly add pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Carol Seefeld of the University of Maryland's Institute for Child Study 
sees too many acquisitive, success-sodden adults chasing after too few 
superficial advantages for their children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Reagan 'You are what you spend' mentality," she said. Seefeld said 
that parents too often have a need to turn their kids into pint-size status 
symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"I have parents who tell me they buy $50 Nikes for their kids because the kids 
really want them. I know developmentally that a 4-year-old doesn't know labels 
unless it is drummed into him. That's why you end up with pre-adolescents 
demanding $100 outfits." 
</P>
<P>
She adds that adolescent pressure and advertising aimed at kids can hardly be 
blamed for the huge amount of money being spent on status items for newborns -- 
$300 strollers, $40 name-brand sneakers, $10 designer booties, $80 coveralls. 
</P>
<P>
Child, a magazine devoted to the nation's newest customers, said a couple can 
spend $60,000 in the first two years of a baby's life. In interviews for this 
story, some parents admitted spending as much as $4,000 a year to outfit older 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very strong sign of the times when our generation is more 
materialistic, where greed and consumption are high on the list," said Lydia 
Caffery, an editor with the Tobe Report, a fashion industry trade publication. 
"The children learn it from their parents -- who has the nicest car on the 
block, who's redecorating the living room." 
</P>
<P>
A related problem, observers say, is that today's parents are no longer the 
countervailing voice against their children's desire for unchecked consumption. 
Consequently, the relationship between parent and child has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up, you wore what you were given," said Searles of Kids 'R' Us. 
"Now, the relationship we see is that parents have veto rights as opposed to 
selection rights. They can say no, but the child is the one who says yes." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents don't have the control because this society is so confusing 
that they try to appease their kids any way they can," psychologist Vanderpool 
said. "A lot of it comes from the fact that parents are more confused today in 
terms of what's right and what's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For many youngsters, designer labels are mainly a way of letting other students 
know that what they're wearing had high price tags. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, students must have name-brand sneakers to be in step, agreed three pupils 
at Burrville Elementary in Washington, D.C., "and they have to cost more than 
$40," chimed in one. The others nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In city after city, when students were asked whether they would wear expensive 
name-brand clothes without the designer label, they said no. The reason? 
"People wouldn't know what it costs." 
</P>
<P>
"They see it as a way of stating their own personal conviction and 
commitments," Shalek said. " 'I'm making a commitment to $60 or $100 versus 
$19.99. This is who I am.' 
</P>
<P>
"Or they see it as a sign of how much your parents care for you. Sometimes, 
it's 'I feel good about my ability to control my parents because I made them 
pay 70 bucks for this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Teens shun discount stores. Linnea Chastain in Chicago refers to them as "loser 
stores." One Chicago mother said her daughter and son won't even sit in the car 
in a discount store parking lot. A mother in Detroit said her son actually hid 
in the restroom when he spotted a classmate as they were shopping in K mart. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, educators and psychologists are disturbed that the emphasis on clothes 
reflects heightened class consciousness among youngsters. And they are saddened 
that children judge individual worth largely on something so superficial. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, who am I to say that a parent who can afford to buy his 
16-year-old a Corvette, shouldn't," said Burrville Elementary Principal Walter 
O. Henry. "But . . . where do we draw the line? When we start letting children 
dictate to us, then we've lost them. Simply because parents are able to buy 
whatever their children want, doesn't necessarily mean that it's the best thing 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Lorie Lawson, a Baltimore custodian, agrees. A single parent, Lawson shelled 
out $1,000 a year to keep her 10-year-old son in the latest clothes, and only 
stopped this year when her son's elementary school went to uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoiled him rotten," she said. "I bought him Nike. I bought him Reebok. I 
bought him BMW sweat shirts. Every day, it was something he just had to have. 
And the more I got, the more he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"It ruined him. His grades went down. He couldn't concentrate in school for 
trying to pay attention to what everybody had on. 
</P>
<P>
"It did something to him and it did something to me. I see what it means for a 
person to be addicted to cocaine."

ON CALIFORNIA: HEADY DAYS FOR A BIBLE THUMPER

<P>
A big week for the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon. For several years now Sheldon and his 
Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim have toiled in the political fields, 
promoting their odd mixture of homophobia and "creation science." You might 
have regarded this stuff as a cultural anachronism, something from the '50s, 
like fins on cars. The past week suggests something different. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Sheldon won a symbolic victory when the State Board of Education 
eliminated a key phrase from its guidelines on the teaching of science. That 
phrase referred to evolution as an observed "fact." Making it disappear from 
the guidelines was one small part of Sheldon's larger campaign to erode the 
standing of evolution science in California schools and elevate the biblical 
story of creation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon did not succeed in that larger campaign. Actually, he did not come 
close. But his victory on the key phrase issue was more than had been expected. 
And in politics, exceeding expectations gives you momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Tuesday. In three California cities -- San Francisco, Concord and 
Irvine -- voters turned against their local gay communities on a variety of 
issues, and the Traditional Values Coalition sought to take full credit. All 
glowy from the results, Sheldon zipped from Anaheim to Sacramento, giving sound 
bites and predicting that sex education classes in public schools will be next 
to feel his fire. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Sheldon would like us to believe that a new dawn has come 
for the Christian fundamentalists. A new dawn that will allow the homophobes 
and fake-science-types to muster their own version of jihad against anyone who 
dares stand against them. 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on it. The news of the past week was, indeed, grim for the gay 
community and disturbing -- at least -- for anyone who believes that religious 
fable should be kept out of science texts. But there's evidence aplenty that 
Sheldon's coalition was merely a hitchhiker on a couple of the darker 
subcurrents running through California politics. 
</P>
<P>
First, let's take the evolution issue. The science guidelines proposed by a 
subcommittee of the Board of Education amounted to one of the strongest 
endorsements of Darwinian theory ever advanced by a public education body. The 
idea behind the guidelines was to send an unmistakable message to textbook 
publishers that California would no longer tolerate dumbed-down science texts. 
</P>
<P>
These guidelines would have met resistance before the full board whether or not 
Sheldon had arrived on the scene. The reason is simple. Gov. George Deukmejian 
has packed the board with new appointees who seem to come from some time warp. 
They're head scratchers, suspicious of new-fangled science, fully willing to 
muddy the intellectual waters. Or to listen to the likes of Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon saw this opportunity and took advantage of it. He carefully cultivated 
his natural allies on the board. And he was the one, at the right time, with 
his face in the television cameras. That may make Sheldon a political player of 
some ability. It does not make him the creator of a backlash movement. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-gay vote is different. Most likely it does represent a backlash 
movement of some sort. The question is, what sort? Were the voters rushing to 
affirm what Sheldon calls the values of the "traditional family," or were they 
reacting to something more troubling? I suspect the second. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this. In Concord and Irvine the issues involved protection of gays 
against discrimination. Now, discrimination can take place in many forums, but 
basically it involves schools and jobs. That means citizens walked into voting 
booths asking themselves whether they would support the right of young AIDS 
victims to attend the same schools as their own children, and the right of 
older AIDS victims to work next to them in offices and factories. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot prove this, but I think the voters thought it over and said no. It was 
too scary. And in San Francisco, where the issue was different, they said no, 
gay relationships could not be equated with heterosexual marriage. 
</P>
<P>
All of which is not good news. These election returns were hardly a rational 
response and may spell more trouble in the future for the gay community. You 
have the sense that some long pent-up anxieties are being set loose in the 
voting booth. 
</P>
<P>
But surely what those votes don't represent is a ringing endorsement of the 
Rev. Sheldon and his band of Bible thumpers. Sheldon was simply there at the 
right time, and proved to be very good at twisting the worst within us to his 
own advantage. You might think of that next time you turn on the television and 
watch him offer his sound bite.

TOMATOES: FULLERTON SEES RED; 
</P>
<P>
SANITATION: THE MASSIVE BEATRICE HUNT-WESSON PLANT HAS BEEN FLUSHING TOMATO 
WASTE INTO SEWERS FOR DECADES. BUT EXPLOSIVE GROWTH HAS TAXED SEWAGE TREATMENT 
CENTERS, AND THE CITY IS NOW SAYING 'NO MORE.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a food fight stewing. 
</P>
<P>
For more than half a century, the massive Beatrice Hunt-Wesson cannery in 
Fullerton quietly has been peeling and washing tomatoes, cooking them to a pulp 
and then turning them into ketchup, paste and sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever was left over was flushed into local sewers. 
</P>
<P>
And during those years, the Orange County Sanitation District quietly has been 
accepting the tomato waste, treating it along with the rest of the county's 
sewage and then discharging it out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation district has had enough of Hunt-Wesson's red-stained tomato 
remains. Faced with explosive urban growth that has severely taxed the sewage 
treatment system and caused concern about environmental damage, the district 
this year turned to its biggest single waste producer -- Hunt-Wesson -- and 
ordered it to cut back dramatically on the tomato scraps. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the cannery, one of the largest in the nation, are taking the 
sanitation district to court to challenge that order. 
</P>
<P>
The cannery is unfairly being held accountable for the fact that growth in the 
surrounding North County area has overloaded the sewer, according to 
Hunt-Wesson. 
</P>
<P>
Plant officials have argued, moreover, that if the district forces the issue, 
the cannery could be forced to build its own treatment plant in order to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
That would cost $7 million, plant officials estimate and could necessitate 
either a sharp cutback in production or, more ominously, a corporate decision 
to move the cannery altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is we're in the tomato processing business, not the sanitation 
business," said Frank J. Quevedo, spokesman for Beatrice Hunt-Wesson Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But the sanitation district, under pressure from state and federal agencies, 
says that unless the tomato waste is curtailed, underwater plant and animal 
life ultimately could suffer. And the sheer volume of it is clogging the sewage 
treatment system, sanitation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical season, Hunt-Wesson officials say, the cannery processes a 
staggering 296,000 tons of tomatoes. Those are transformed into Hunt's ketchup, 
Hunt's tomato paste and Hunt's tomato sauce, as well as an average of 2.3 
million pounds of tomato waste. 
</P>
<P>
When it is in full operation, sanitation district officials say, the cannery 
accounts for as much waste discharge in a single day as all the residences and 
businesses in the cities of Anaheim and Fullerton combined -- an area with 
about 350,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation district's leverage against the cannery is an annual waste 
discharge permit that comes up for renewal in January. 
</P>
<P>
The order to cut waste discharges went out not only to Hunt-Wesson, but also to 
other major industries including two other North County food processing plants, 
said Thomas L. Woodruff, general counsel and spokesman for the sanitation 
district. There was some grumbling, but all of the other industries complied 
with the cutbacks, Woodruff said. 
</P>
<P>
At first the Hunt-Wesson plant complied as well, halving its daily output from 
as much as 50,000 pounds of tomato waste to just above 25,000 by instituting 
some tidier housekeeping measures. 
</P>
<P>
But the plant balked when the sanitation district in February ordered it to 
either curtail the discharges by another 15% immediately and a total of 62% 
over a five-year period -- or face loss of its discharge permit. The district 
ultimately wants the cannery to discharge no more than 10,000 pounds of waste a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials responded to the order by filing a lawsuit. The disagreement 
moves into Orange County Superior Court on Nov. 15 for the first of what could 
be many hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"Making us do what they're trying to make us do is not going to solve their 
problems. They have to increase capacity," Quevedo said of the sanitation 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt-Wesson employs a total of about 3,500 workers in Fullerton, making it one 
of Orange County's largest employers. The cannery itself employs about 1,200 
workers, of which 700 to 900 work there on a seasonal basis, Quevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Between November and May, the cannery that takes up much of a city block sits 
idle, just another building in an industrial complex along West Valencia Drive 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But come late May or early June, the Hunt-Wesson cannery springs to life. 
Trucks haul produce, mostly from the fields of Southern California's Imperial 
Valley, and seasonal workers flock back to the plant to process the tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
In the company's lawsuit, Hunt-Wesson attorney Joel S. Moskowitz says that 
Hunt-Wesson's volume of tomatoes has remained essentially unchanged since 1970. 
The area around the plant has grown dramatically during this time, however. In 
fact, that growth is prompting the sanitation district to look for additional 
capacity for its two sewage treatment plants in Fountain Valley and Huntington 
Beach, Moskowitz said in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation in this case could take years to resolve, Woodruff said, because 
Hunt-Wesson shows no inclination of backing down. Quevedo said, however, the 
company wants this dispute resolved as quickly as possible.

200-YEAR-OLD LAW MAKES LIFE HARD FOR IMMIGRANT FISHERMEN FROM VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three miles offshore from Newport Beach, Ha Tan Bang stood on the rolling deck 
of the Saint Ann as a few purple, foot-long sea creatures known as slime eels 
slithered past. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam-born fisherman has been scouring the ocean muck for the last nine 
months in search of this hideous-looking eel -- a creature most fishermen 
disdain. Even Ha was shocked the first time he saw one and thought: "Do I 
really want to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
As a big one slid along the deck after falling out of a trap, he grabbed the 
eel and tossed it into a 100-gallon barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The white people, they don't want to do this," he said in halting English. "If 
I had the money, I'd quit. This ocean . . . it's hard to make money." 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal waters of Southern California, Ha and a small band of Vietnamese 
fishermen have carved a precarious living from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
From a single vessel in 1981, the Los Angeles group has grown to about 15 boats 
and 50 fishermen based on a dreary dock at Fish Harbor on the eastern end of 
Terminal Island. The group is the second-largest Vietnamese fleet on the West 
Coast after Monterey Bay's, according to the Vietnamese Fishermen Assn. of 
America, a 200-member advocacy group based in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Their lives revolve around the shifting tides of the rock cod, kingfish and now 
the slime eel markets. 
</P>
<P>
But they face a host of problems from an outside world they see as strange, 
irrational and sometimes cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first appearance of the Vietnamese fishermen, they have labored under 
the threat of a 200-year-old federal law prohibiting non-citizens from 
operating large commercial fishing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The law has resulted in fines and the threatened confiscation of some boats, 
forcing many Vietnamese to resort to hiring what they call "paper captains," 
usually Anglo deckhands who are paid to sit and pretend to be the masters of 
the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese fishermen filed suit in San Francisco against the U.S. Coast Guard, 
claiming that the law is discriminatory. On Tuesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals temporarily stopped enforcement of the law while it hears arguments 
over its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the fleet has also spawned sporadic resentment in the tight-knit 
community of Fish Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Some fishermen complain that the Vietnamese routinely break the law by 
harvesting undersize fish and using gill nets in prohibited areas -- 
allegations the Vietnamese deny. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a brooding intolerance of the Vietnamese, whom many fishermen see 
as impenetrably strange, intrusive and foreign. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Whitfield, a fisherman who docks just a few yards away from the Vietnamese, 
stood on the deck of his boat with his hands on his hips one recent afternoon 
and complained that the Vietnamese pollute the dock with fish guts, play loud 
music that sounds like banging kitchen pans and make a mess in the nearby 
public toilets. They added that the Vietnamese's dried fish are a public health 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"They dry them until they look like potato chips with flies you can't believe," 
Whitfield said, shaking his head in disgust. "It's a basic mentality of 'Screw 
you.' They have their own rules." 
</P>
<P>
Ha shrugs at such complaints, saying he hears them all the time and knows 
there's little he can do to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
It is a little after 3:30 a.m. when the day begins at Fish Harbor with the 
first sound of diesel engines growling from the Vietnamese side of the docks. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with jumbo cups of coffee and a few packs of English cigarettes, Ha and a 
friend trundle down the dock toward the Saint Ann. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice day," Ha says, taking a quick look at the water around him. "Very flat." 
</P>
<P>
At 28, Ha is a wiry man with a brushy mustache whom the fishermen have 
nicknamed "Hung," a Vietnamese word for courageous. He lives by himself in an 
apartment in Westminster in Orange County, crammed with homemade slime eel 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
Ha has been commuting to Fish Harbor since 1981 and is one of the most 
experienced Vietnamese fishermen there. 
</P>
<P>
The other fishermen come from throughout Vietnam, and the names of their 
hometowns are painted on boats scattered around the dock: An Hoa, Cam Ranh, Nha 
Trang, Kien Giang. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the others, Ha fled Vietnam after the Communist takeover by going 
fishing one day and never returning. Thai pirates robbed him twice en route to 
Thailand, and he spent 19 months in a refugee camp there before arriving in the 
United States in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he worked as a janitor and a lathe operator but he jumped at the 
chance when a friend invited him to go fishing. 
</P>
<P>
He started by gill-netting for rock cod, kingfish and whatever else he could 
find until the unexpected birth of a market for slime eels, a slippery, 
sharp-toothed creature that exists on the very fringes of California's 
multimillion-dollar fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
No one in these waters had ever bothered trapping the creature until late last 
year, when Korean buyers began showing up in California offering money for the 
eels, the skin of which is used in Korea to make wallets, shoes and handbags. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, only Vietnamese fishermen trap the eels, said Barbara 
Diem, one of the buyers at Fish Harbor. "I've tried Americans before, but for 
them, it's a lot of work for not much money," she said. "These guys 
(Vietnamese) are smart and they work hard." 
</P>
<P>
So far, about half the Vietnamese boats have switched over to slime eels. The 
fishermen go out six or seven days a week for at least 12 hours a day. At best, 
they get 40 cents a pound for the eels, and Ha figures that if he is lucky, he 
will make $12,000 to $15,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much money, " Ha said, "but it's not too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Contending with the sea and the vagaries of the slime eel market, however, is 
sometimes the least of the Vietnamese fishermen's worries. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Ha was fined $2,000 for violating the federal law that 
prohibits non-citizens from operating U.S. commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Ross Wheatley, an assistant district legal officer in 
Long Beach, said the law was enacted in 1789 as a way of ensuring an ample 
supply of ships in time of war and of preserving the integrity of the U.S. 
fishing fleet. It applies to the largest supertanker down to fishing boats of 
about 30 feet in length, he added. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Vietnamese fishermen have skirted the law by hiring paper 
captains to pretend they are the masters of the boat. They are usually paid 
$200 a week to sit on board and read magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Vietnamese boats are like that," said Jeff Nghien of San Jose as 
he sat in the captain's chair of the Kien Giang 9 one recent day. After talking 
for a few minutes, Nghien, a U.S. citizen, admitted that he was, in fact, the 
paper captain of the Kien Giang 9. The real owner was outside on the deck 
nonchalantly tying up the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy, which is well known to the Coast Guard, doesn't always work. 
</P>
<P>
In Ha's case, the paper captain he hired panicked as the Coast Guard boarded 
the Saint Ann and he pointed out Ha as the real captain. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Ha went out the next day and hired a new paper captain. 
</P>
<P>
The life of a paper captain is no joy ride. 
</P>
<P>
David Blansett, an Anglo deckhand at Fish Harbor, said he has worked as one 
several times, although he swears he will never do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he went out on a boat from Ventura and after a few days at 
sea ran into a "major storm." A discussion of whether the boat should go back 
turned into a fistfight between Blansett and the rest of the crew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blansett, a hulking man who towers over the Vietnamese, said he won the 
argument and the ship returned to harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll fish in all sorts of bad conditions," he said. "I tested myself to see 
if I could do it, and it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The determination of the Vietnamese fishermen to go out in all kinds of weather 
and in some of the most infirm vessels around is legendary at Fish Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Before slime eels, the mainstay of the Vietnamese fleet was rock cod, which 
required traveling at least 70 or 80 miles out to sea and staying a week or 
more regardless of storms or cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
Other fishermen also made this trip, but the Vietnamese made it in what even 
they conceded were some of the most decrepit boats on the water. 
</P>
<P>
"They're daring," said one Anglo fisherman. "I wouldn't go out in those boats." 
</P>
<P>
Ha owns the only steel-hulled Vietnamese boat, built with the help of a $30,000 
interest-free loan from a local seafood wholesaler. The others are made of 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
At least two of the wooden boats have sunk at sea. Just a few months ago, the 
Nha Trang sank while tied up to the dock. "The American boats have everything," 
Ha said. "We have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last eight years, two Vietnamese fishermen have suffocated at sea 
after leaving a gasoline generator running at night in the cabin as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them were good friends," said Ha, who found the bodies the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of the slime eel market has come as a welcome respite for the 
Vietnamese fishermen, since the traps are placed only a few miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
But those who cannot find work trapping slime eels must continue gill-netting 
for rock cod, kingfish and halibut. It is in this arena that they have drawn 
the most complaints from other fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, angry local shrimpers burned several Vietnamese vessels eights years 
ago. A mock boat labeled "Viet Cong" was burned during a Ku Klux Klan rally in 
Houston the same year. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles also, tensions have smoldered. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is rooted in the complex California Department of Fish and Game 
regulations on gill-netting. The regulations restrict the water depth, net 
size, species, fish length and time of year the nets can be used to ensure a 
future supply of fish for sport and commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Many fishermen say the Vietnamese routinely break the gill-net rules to bring 
in bigger catches. 
</P>
<P>
"They claim they don't know the law but they do," said Butch Meyer, captain of 
the Americo, docked at Fish Harbor. "They've wiped out every damn little fish 
around." 
</P>
<P>
"They take anything on their boats," Blansett said. "We're not picking on the 
Vietnamese; they're picking on us." 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese fishermen say they do not fully understand the regulations, 
which they see as sometimes irrational and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I want to give someone a fish to eat, I have to fill out a form," said 
Ha, who has been fined twice for gill-netting violations. 
</P>
<P>
Ha said that, because of the fines, few Vietnamese intentionally break the 
rules. "At first, we had big problems," he said. "We thought it was like 
Vietnam. You just go out in the sea. The fishing is free." 
</P>
<P>
But Fish and Game Capt. Gene Martin is skeptical. He said the department's 
regulation book is printed in only one foreign language: Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a higher percentage of violations with Southeast Asians," he said. 
"This is a money-making operation. When there's money to be made, people are 
willing to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
The chances of violating the gill-netting regulations has been reduced since 
the Vietnamese switched to trapping slime eels, a virtually unregulated market. 
</P>
<P>
But no one is sure how much longer the trade will last. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fishermen believe their generation will be the first and last at 
Fish Harbor, since none of them want their children to even think about 
following in their footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go far from home," said Duong Van Ngan, who came down from Ventura 
with the Eclipse a few months ago to search for slime eels. "The children have 
school and everything else. There is enough for them to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Ha also is thinking of getting out of the business and, in fact, has put his 
boat up for sale, although he doubts that anyone will buy it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Ha has already started thinking about his next move. 
</P>
<P>
"Snails," he said, describing the three-inch-round sea snails that Americans 
call periwinkles. "They will take 1,000 pounds a day, 45 cents a pound." 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, he figures, he'll give it a try.

BILL TO PROTECT DESERT DRAWS A NOISY 2,000 
</P>

<P>
A boisterous crowd of nearly 2,000 gathered here Saturday for a congressional 
hearing on legislation designed to protect the California desert by creating 
three national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Waving signs and chanting cheers in a way reminiscent of a high school pep 
rally, opponents on both sides of the mushrooming desert preservation battle 
staged raucous demonstrations before crowding into a hall to testify before a 
congressional committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Passing this law would be like fencing off the desert, and my livelihood would 
be taken away," said Bob Meeh, 42, a limestone miner in Lucerne Valley, as he 
held a "Save Our Jobs" sign above his head. "That doesn't sit too well with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Electrical engineer Dave MacKenzie expressed a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"The desert is an extremely sensitive space and we have already done it great 
damage," said MacKenzie, 43, a hiker and bird watcher from San Diego. "It would 
be a wise investment for all Californians to protect this spectacular place 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Barstow police -- fearing a flare-up of tempers -- increased security for the 
hearing, but there were no arrests or confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of yelling back and forth, but mostly people were orderly," a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the hearing, convened by the House national parks and public lands 
subcommittee, was the California Desert Protection Act, proposed by Rep. Mel 
Levine (D-Santa Monica) and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
The bill would create a 1.5-million acre national park in the Mojave Desert, 
east of Barstow, and greatly expand Death Valley and Joshua Tree national 
monuments, while redesignating them as national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Another 4.4 million acres of desert would be set aside in 81 wilderness areas 
stretching from the White Mountains near Bishop south to the Algodones Dunes 
near the U.S.-Mexican border. And 3 million acres now controlled by the U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management would be transferred to the National Park Service, 
which conservationists believe would be a more vigilant steward. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates believe the bill is vital to safeguard the future of the desert and 
its denizens, many of which have become imperiled by encroaching urbanization 
and increasing recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say mining, livestock grazing, military maneuvers and 
off-road vehicle riding are among activities that have harmed the desert, a 
fragile ecosystem that is slow to heal because it receives so little rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the measure would reserve the desert for the enjoyment of 
the few, "locking out" those whose activities would be limited or banned in 
wilderness areas and national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these foes favor a competing bill, introduced recently by Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Redlands). The proposal, which Lewis calls "the people's bill," would 
designate 2.1 million acres of desert as wilderness, while preserving grazing 
and mining rights. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 6 a.m. Saturday, participants began streaming toward the hearing 
and the lively rallies that preceded it. Supporters of the bill -- including 
members of the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society as well as other conservation 
groups -- turned out in bright yellow T-shirts and came from as far away as Las 
Vegas and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"The turnout is symbolic of the importance of this battle," said Patricia 
Schifferle, California regional director of the Wilderness Society. "Here in 
the desert, you have an evolutionary record of adaptation that spans 40 million 
years. . . . Its significance and need for protection can't be overstated." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also journeyed long distances. Some traveled in convoys of 
motorcycles 20 riders long, while workers in at least one desert mine rode to 
the hearing on buses rented by their employer, who also supplied box lunches. 
</P>
<P>
While an overflow crowd listened to the proceedings outside the meeting hall, 
those testifying inside mostly repeated arguments that have grown familiar 
after years of debate on the issue. But some offered new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
A few opponents, for example, suggested the Cranston-Levine act would lead to 
drug use by teen-agers no longer able to ride all-terrain vehicles in the 
desert. Another warned it would threaten the family unit by prohibiting car 
camping in wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists told of seeing once-pristine sand dunes scarred by off-road 
vehicle tracks, of no longer seeing kangaroo rats or prairie falcons in places 
where they once thrived. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to opponents' claim that the legislation would lock them out of the 
desert, Don Moore of Ridgecrest said hikers and others who appreciate the 
desert for its serenity and wild inhabitants already have had their hobbies 
spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been locked out -- locked out by the off-roaders, whose sport is 
destruction," said Moore, a member of the Kerncrest Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
Erick Briggs, 11, was among the hundreds of desert lovers who did not get a 
chance to speak Saturday. Erick, of Desert Hot Springs, wanted to tell the 
congressmen about the desert tortoise, a species recently declared endangered 
under an emergency federal action. 
</P>
<P>
He brought along his two pet tortoises -- legally registered with the state 
Department of Fish and Game -- to underscore his argument. Holding Franklin in 
one hand and Teddy in the other, he explained that he was worried about the 
remaining desert tortoises struggling to fend off threats from predatory 
ravens, disease, a shortage of food caused by competition with cattle and 
careless off-road vehicle users. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of problems -- like predators, people shooting them and 
people running over them," Erick said. "They have to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's hearing was one of three field hearings on the legislation to be 
held in California. The final one will be in Los Angeles early next year.

A U.S. Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship in the Straight of Malacca 
northwest of Singapore today, killing one American sailor and injuring four 
shipmates, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the dead and injured are being withheld until their relatives 
could be notified, Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet in 
Honolulu,said. 
</P>
<P>
Several fires broke out aboard the destroyer Kinkaid and the Singapore vessel 
Kota Petani when they collided at 5:19 this morning local time, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The fires aboard the San Diego-based destroyer were quickly contained, and the 
crew of the Kincaid and the frigate Rentz helped douse the flames aboard the 
Kota Petani, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported aboard the merchant vessel, which sustained major 
damage to its bow, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collision was under investigation, Anderson said.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent President Bush an "informal message" 
expressing support for the spiraling political changes taking place in East 
Germany, the White House said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the message, sent by cable on Friday, Gorbachev "underscored the importance 
of the changes taking place there and expressed the hope that the situation 
will remain calm and peaceful," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While other Soviet officials have offered support for the dramatic moves in 
East Germany, the disclosure of the message to Bush was apparently the first 
public demonstration of Gorbachev's backing since the East German government 
opened its borders last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the President probably would respond to the Soviet leader with 
his own encouragement of political and economic reform in East Germany this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, East Germany has been a key member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact 
military alliance. It has been among Moscow's strongest supporters, both in 
facing off against the West and in maintaining a tight rein on its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But until last week, East Germany had refused to follow the reform path taken 
by Gorbachev, who reportedly encouraged the country's new leader, Egon Krenz, 
to press for change. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry, on Thursday welcomed the formation of a new Politburo and other East 
German leadership changes announced the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the Soviet Union would accept a non-Communist government in East 
Germany and in other East European countries as long as they remain members of 
the Warsaw Pact. But he offered no comment on the opening of the East German 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachev cable, relayed to Bush in Dallas, came as the superpowers watched 
the unfolding events in Eastern Europe, capped by the rush of East Berliners 
across the Berlin Wall in the wake of East Germany's decision to abandon travel 
and emigration restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a disintegration of that form of totalitarianism in Eastern 
Europe," Bush said in an interview published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's a contagious disease and Castro catches it and Daniel Ortega 
catches it and perhaps Gen. Noriega catches it," he said. Fidel Castro is the 
leader of Cuba, Ortega is the president of Nicaragua and Manuel A. Noriega is 
the military leader of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But, reflecting the continuing unease, uncertainty and amazement with which 
senior U.S. policy-makers view the situation in Eastern and Central Europe, 
Bush said the low-key U.S. response stems from a desire to "not contribute to 
an unforeseen disorder." 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to predict with certainty what is going to happen," Bush 
said, while repeating his view that the change "is real." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he has no plans to visit Berlin immediately after his meeting Dec. 
2-3 with Gorbachev on U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean Sea 
near Malta. But he did not completely rule out such a dramatic journey. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would fly to Berlin after the Malta meeting, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"No, no -- unless there were something that developed between now and then that 
would make the presence of the U.S. President catalytic for peace or for 
evolution of democracy. But just to go there -- I would not do that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gorbachev's efforts to free the Soviet economy from 70 years of rigid 
state control, Bush said the reforms are not occurring at a pace that justifies 
inviting the Soviet Union to join the annual summit conference of leading 
industrial democracies. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "Should the Soviets want to discuss how to improve their 
economy," the United States would be willing to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The text of Bush's interview, conducted Friday by reporters from four Texas 
newspapers shortly after the President arrived in Dallas for an overnight 
visit, was made available by the news organizations Saturday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated three quarters of a million EastGermans swarmed into the West on 
Saturday on the second day of their new-found freedom, but to the growing 
relief of both East and West German authorities, the majority were on their way 
home by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials issued the startling news Saturday that fully 1.6 million 
East Germans -- one-tenth of the entire population -- had been issued travel 
visas since the border opening announcement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the officials claimed that 2.7 million visas had been issued since 
late Thursday -- with 1.1 million issued within five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Only 8,160 people had applied to emigrate during that same period, according to 
the figures. 
</P>
<P>
During repeated discussions in Duderstadt and nearby border communities with 
East German visitors, it appeared that new East German leader Egon Krenz's 
dramatic gamble to open the border at the risk of a wholesale exodus had won 
the beleaguered Communist regime at least a brief breathing space. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those interviewed say they believe the borders will remain open and 
that Krenz has little choice but to follow through with his promise to hold 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Although not always expressed as such, it was clear the majority of East German 
visitors now believe a fundamental shift of power has taken place in their 
homeland, a shift away from the Communist Party to a population bubbling with 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are changing," declared Ursula Weschka, a 26-year-old office worker 
from the East German border village of Kettenborn. "There will be free 
elections, I'm convinced of that." 
</P>
<P>
If the Communist leadership either reneged on its promise of free elections or 
attempted to close the border, there would be more and far-larger public 
demonstrations, several predicted. Many said they planned to return to 
demonstrate peacefully until elections take place. 
</P>
<P>
Others indicated that only a new crackdown would make them consider leaving for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seemed that only those who declared themselves refugees -- about 5% 
of the total crossing over during the first two days -- believe that the 
present easing of conditions is temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the (Communists) who lied to us for 40 years; how can you be expected 
to believe what those same people promise now?" asked Frank Schmidt, 43, a 
foundry worker from Thale. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the skeptics, newly arrived refugees housed in a sports center 
near here also included families who said they had been actively harassed for 
opposing the Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One man said he had lost his job and had faced weekly police interrogations 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
But in Duderstadt and elsewhere, it was the day trippers who dominated. 
</P>
<P>
Along Germany's 860-mile internal frontier, a vast, impromptu carnival 
blossomed as East and West Germans celebrated the shredding of the Iron Curtain 
that had kept them apart. 
</P>
<P>
They came by car and by special trains and buses in such volume that many West 
German border communities blocked off traffic and turned themselves into giant 
pedestrian zones. 
</P>
<P>
The number of those who crossed Saturday was triple the figure registered for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams as long as 20 miles built up at many border points. 
</P>
<P>
Telegram and telephone services between the two Germanys reached a breaking 
point, with East German authorities saying it would take up to four days to 
clear the backlog of telegrams, mainly from West Germans extending invitations 
to relatives in the East. 
</P>
<P>
In most areas, the atmosphere was light and carefree. 
</P>
<P>
The knowledge that they had not had to give up their homes to enjoy a day in 
the West left Germans from both sides of the border exhilarated. 
</P>
<P>
In the main square of this quaint, thousand-year-old market town, 150 miles 
southwest of Berlin, and in countless other communities along the border, they 
danced, cheered and gradually began to take in the prospect that a new and 
better life had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Near the north German port city of Luebek, a band greeted those crossing from 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
At the busiest inner-German border crossing near Helmstedt, East Germans stuck 
flowers in the jacket pockets of West Germany border guards and waved to crowds 
applauding along the road. 
</P>
<P>
In Duderstadt, the staff of the local newspaper sponsored a spontaneous street 
fair with blaring rock music and beer for the equivalent of a nickel a glass. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the border region, the notoriously iron-clad regulations that 
dictate that all retail selling end by 2 p.m. on Saturday were officially 
suspended. Many shops stayed open past 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors said so many families crossed the border that East German schools, 
which normally operate Saturday, closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents used their $60 "welcome money" from the West German government to 
buy fruit and toys for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Duderstadt's largest children's store was packed with customers. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't like Christmastime, it's more than that," commented the store's 
owner, Herbert Schamstieg. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, an East German girl quietly stroked the hair of her newly purchased 
Barbie Doll. 
</P>
<P>
The look of awe on her face as she gazed at her new toy confirmed the store 
owner's remark.

<P>
Mindful that millions of Chinese protested for democratic reform only five 
months ago, the Chinese media have been careful in reporting the dramatic 
political changes in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The media have reported some of the developments in East Germany without 
suggesting the reasons behind them. They have not reported on the mass exodus 
of East Germans to the West, or on crowds chipping away at the Berlin Wall with 
hand tools. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, gave 
a dry account Saturday of how East Germany had opened its borders to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said Secretary of State James A. Baker III hailed the East German 
move as a "very positive change." But it quoted West Germany's interior 
minister as urging people to "think hard about coming over because for a long 
time their living conditions will be worse than they have now." 
</P>
<P>
While Western leaders assert that leadership upheavals in East Germany, 
Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria indicate the failure of communism, the Chinese 
reports depict communism as still commanding the faith of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"Krenz Reelected After Politburo Resigns" said a headline Thursday in the 
English-language China Daily. The article noted that new East German leader 
Egon Krenz and seven Politburo members were retained in the new lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have not mentioned the internal political pressures that led to the 
resignation of East German leader Erich Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy demonstrations rocked about 80 Chinese cities last spring, 
culminating in the crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tian An Men Square on 
June 3-4. Hundreds and possibly thousands were killed during the crackdown. 
Thousands more have been arrested since, squelching overt dissent. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British Broadcasting Corp. said its broadcasts to China are 
being deliberately jammed, depriving millions of Mandarin-speaking Chinese of a 
primary source of Western news. 
</P>
<P>
"The jamming is being directed at a number of the BBC's frequencies carrying 
World Service programs in Mandarin. The interference starts a few minutes 
before the transmissions begin and stops shortly after they end," said a BBC 
statement in London. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union stopped jamming BBC Russian Service broadcasts in 1987 and 
lifted its interference with BBC Polish broadcasts a year later. In the past, 
there has been no interference with BBC Chinese broadcasts, the BBC said. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC increased its Mandarin broadcasts by a half-hour early in June, 
bringing the total to three hours daily.

DEMANDS ON PROPOSALS FLEXIBLE, SHAMIR SAYS 
</P>

In the uneasy days before his meeting with President Bush, Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir says he is willing to consider Middle East peace proposals from 
Washington that fall short of Israel's demands -- but not to give in to talks 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Israel made several key demands of the United States as a 
condition for acceptance of a five-point peace plan from Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III. The plan is designed to get Israeli-Palestinian talks under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what will be the proposals (from Baker)," Shamir said in an 
interview. "Maybe he will accept all our proposals. And if there will be some 
other proposals of the secretary, I think it will have to be considered by our 
Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir declined to specify which conditions he might be willing to give up -- 
his government also wants to narrow the scope of the talks to details for 
holding Palestinian elections -- but the combative prime minister expressed 
confidence that Washington "will not bring the PLO to the negotiating table 
against our will." 
</P>
<P>
This week's Bush-Shamir talks -- they will meet Wednesday at the White House -- 
have been the subject of strained diplomatic give-and-take. Bush withheld the 
invitation on the grounds that he needed assurances bilateral talks would be 
positive. In Israel, the delay was viewed as implied criticism of Shamir's 
unwillingness to accept Baker's peace plan without conditions and a foretaste 
of a rough ride in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir himself declined to discuss the handling of the invitation. "I'm not 
ready to comment," he said tersely. The United States is itself negotiating 
with the PLO, and those talks have become the main sore point between Jerusalem 
and Washington. Shamir asserted that the Washington-PLO talks make it 
impossible for Israel to find independent peace partners. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't help," Shamir said. "I think that this dialogue strengthens the 
PLO. It discourages people who have other views to be more outspoken to do 
something for peace." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir bases his opposition to talks with the PLO on its demand for an 
independent state. "It's not a matter of a capricious mind," he said. "The 
reason is very simple. . . . If we would agree to talk to the PLO, it will 
express our readiness to negotiate about a Palestinian state." 
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States also disagree on the framework for a final peace 
solution, Shamir added. Washington believes that Israel should give up at least 
some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir hopes the subject will not come up in Washington. "I think these 
differences are not relevant now because the advantage of the peace process is 
to give the parties the possibility to negotiate in a gradual way about 
advancing toward peace (while) having different views, different positions 
about the ultimate goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare admission, Shamir said he does not think that the Israeli army can 
fully repress the Arab uprising in the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some difficulties, of course, in handling this problem," Shamir said. 
"And the main difficulty of ours is . . . we are not ready, for moral reasons, 
to use all the necessary force to put an end to these violent manifestations."

Thousands of people who falsified farm worker amnesty applications will get 
permanent resident status starting next month under the 1986 immigration law, 
the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which offered farm workers a one-time amnesty, was expected to 
accommodate 250,000, but more than 1.3 million illegal aliens applied for 
legalization, the newspaper reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and immigration experts estimate that between 250,000 and 
650,000 applications are fraudulent, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has identified 398,000 cases of 
possible fraud but admits that it does not have the manpower or money to 
prosecute individual applicants, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
The INS is to begin issuing permanent resident status to amnesty applicants on 
Dec. 1, and officials said they were approving 94% of the applicants overall. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the amnesty program has ensured the nation a cheap, reliable and 
legal supply of farm workers and has taken an important step toward 
legitimizing many of the nation's illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
But critics note cases like that of Larry and Sharon Marval of Newark, N.J., 
who pleaded guilty last year to charges of immigration fraud after 
investigators alleged they were part of an operation that helped about 1,000 
aliens get amnesty with falsified documents showing they had all worked on just 
30 acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
The farm workers' amnesty was a last-minute addition to the Immigration Reform 
and Control Act of 1986, which sought to halt illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
It included a general amnesty offering a chance at permanent resident status to 
those illegal aliens who could prove that they had lived in the United States 
since before Jan. 1, 1982. The act also made it a crime to employ illegal 
aliens.

The Navy commissioned a $3.5-billion nuclear aircraft carrier Saturday and 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the country must keep its military strong 
despite the liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a Europe that is whole and free," Cheney said at 
commissioning ceremonies at Norfolk Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO is a rock in that sea of change. This is not the time to reduce any of 
our commitments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the rapid change in East Germany -- where the government opened its 
borders with the West last week -- and reforms in many other Warsaw Pact 
nations, Cheney said those reforms were brought about by the United States' 
military strength. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the fruits of our patience. But we know from history that the 
Kremlin is capable of rapid shifts of intention," Cheney said. "It took five 
years to build this carrier. Intentions can change overnight." 
</P>
<P>
The 100,000-ton, 1,092-foot Abraham Lincoln, the Navy's heaviest warship, will

After parking her van on the side of a paved road that cuts across Everglades 
National Park, Sue Haley hopped out and headed off through the waist-high saw 
grass toward an alligator hole in a small stand of cypress trees 300 yards 
away. About halfway there she stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"See this water?" she asked. Looking down toward her rubber-booted feet, Haley 
aimed a finger at the spongy carpet of algae on which she walked, the green 
tangles of carnivorous bladderwort plant and the minnows swimming around her 
toes. The clear, still water crested just above her ankles. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally," said Haley, 31, a park ranger here for eight years, "the water 
would be almost up to my knees at this time of year. But last summer we had 
drought, no water has been released into the park at all this year, and already 
-- early in November -- animals are congregating around water holes in order to 
find food. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets so frustrating," she added. "What the Everglades needs is lots of 
support and respect for water as a finite resource. But we take it for granted. 
And there just isn't enough water to (develop) South Florida . . . and save 
this park too." 
</P>
<P>
The seasonal change from wet to dry is always a critical time in the 
Everglades, testing the survival capabilities of scores of unique plants and 
animals that live here in a delicate web unlike any other on Earth. Over the 
winter, alligators, raccoons, herons, mosquito fish and a wide variety of other 
links in the food chain will gather at water holes to play out a timeless, 
elemental drama of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
But this year the park itself is fighting to survive. The Everglades, under 
siege from pollution, an invasion of exotic species of plants and animals, 
urban development and unnatural water levels regulated by computer, teeters on 
the edge of what former park Supt. Mike Finley called "ecosystem collapse." 
</P>

Most scientists believe that with a more natural water distribution pattern and 
less interference from people, the Everglades can be saved. But for some rare 
native animals, it may already be too late. The Everglades snail kite is 
disappearing, the population of endangered Florida panthers has dropped to 
about 30 and the number of wading birds in the park has declined to 10% of 
1930s levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prediction is that we're going to see no successful wading bird nesting in 
the park this year," said Everglades researcher John Ogden. "With wood storks, 
egrets, and white ibis, the situation is in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The Everglades is also beset with serious problems of contamination caused by 
agricultural runoff rich in nutrients. Those nutrients have fueled a 
proliferation of plants such as cattails, which for years have been spreading 
at the rate of five acres a day, choking off naturally occurring species. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is also a threat. This summer, anglers were warned not to eat bass and 
catfish caught in the park, and just last month an autopsy on a Florida panther 
revealed enough mercury to kill a human. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,200 square miles of freshwater marshland that make up Everglades National 
Park occupy almost the entire tip of the Florida peninsula, but they are a mere 
one-tenth of a vast wetlands system that begins at Lake Kissimmee in the center 
of the state and includes Lake Okeechobee as well as millions of acres of 
drained and diked land that now produces sugar cane, tomatoes and beans. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by some 4.5 million residents of Florida's east and west coasts, no 
federal preserve is closer to a major urban area and, according to the 
Wilderness Society, no park is closer to extinction. Saving it is now the 
responsibility of Robert S. Chandler, who in December succeeds Finley as 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, 53, is a 30-year veteran of the National Parks Service who comes here 
after six years as superintendent of Olympic National Park in Washington. From 
1978 to 1983 he held the top job at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
With the Everglades facing increasing pressure from oil companies who want to 
drill in adjacent offshore waters, as well as a host of complex water delivery 
issues, Chandler knows what he's up against. "The park is in real trouble; 
that's reality," he said. "But this is not the time to simply throw up our 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis that grips the Everglades did not come about overnight. For several 
decades attacks on the wetlands went almost unnoticed, provoking no public 
outcry in the same way that, for example, a plan to level the landscape of 
Yosemite or fill in the Grand Canyon surely would. The Everglades, after all, 
looks like an immense swamp, is a forbidding expanse of grass and scrub trees, 
is hot and desolate, crawls with dangerous reptiles and is the perfect breeding 
ground for blood-thirsty mosquitoes that will later blow into Miami and annoy 
people to slap-happy distraction. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also a river -- a "river of grass" in environmentalist Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas' words -- that runs 6 inches deep, 50 miles wide and flows 
gently southward for 120 miles, from Lake Okeechobee in the center of the state 
to the peninsula's tip. Overlaying the Biscayne Aquifer, the Everglades also is 
the source of drinking water for 90% of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The Everglades' problems are myriad, but they all begin -- and end -- with 
water. Soon after the park was established in 1947, the demand for flood 
control and more dry land for homes and farms outside its borders led to the 
construction of 1,500 miles of levees and canals that crisscross the Everglades 
and block the free flow of water. 
</P>
<P>
Now, decisions about who gets water -- how much and when -- are made not by 
nature but by hydrologists working for the state. And when those decisions run 
contrary to the natural nesting cycles of birds, or the seasonal food needs of 
fish, for example, wildlife suffers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got is a robot Everglades which doesn't work as well as it did when 
nature controlled it," said Joe Podgor of Friends of the Everglades, a public 
interest group begun by Douglas 20 years ago. "We've made a mess of it, and now 
we've got to put the system back the way God made it.' 
</P>
<P>
That won't be easy. While militant environmentalists like Podgor suggest 
breaking down levees and filling in canals to restore the Everglades, that is 
unlikely to happen. More probable is a system of water control that is driven 
more by rainfall than by the desires of powerful farming interests and coastal 
residents who favor green lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some extraordinary signs have emerged indicating just how dire the 
situation is. In October, 1988, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Dexter Lehtinen, 
filed a lawsuit charging that state regulatory agencies had "breached the 
public trust" by allowing polluted water from adjacent agricultural areas to 
flow into the Everglades. The suit asks a federal judge to monitor the agencies 
that are supposed to be protecting the park. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which for more than 20 years dug the canals 
and installed the floodgates that now define South Florida, has also begun 
studies on how to regulate the flow of water into the park so that it more 
closely mirrors the natural cycle of wet and dry. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a measure considered vital to the preservation of wading birds and the 
Florida panther, a bill before Congress would add 107,000 acres to the park at 
its northeast corner. Chandler says working for passage of that bill "is one of 
the first things on my agenda." 
</P>
<P>
No one seriously suggests that Everglades National Park is dead yet. But 
according to Friends of the Everglades' Podgor: "It is on life-support, like a 
patient with an IV drip, hanging on the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to come to grips with the water budget, and live within 
our means," he said. "In 20 years, the Glades could turn into a field of 
cattails, and Lake Okeechobee could be a slime pit. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news may be that things are so bad that even the most simple-minded 
among us -- and I mean elected officials -- can see the problems clearly. The 
answer is to put the system back so that it works the natural way. If not, 
we'll not only lose the Everglades, but we won't have anything to drink."

CHARGERS LOOK TO CHILL HOT RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
"-----------.": CHARGER QUARTERBACK JIM MCMAHON TO LOCAL BEAT REPORTERS ON 
TODAY'S HOME GAME AGAINST THE RAIDERS. 
</P>

<P>
And, yes, according to McMahon's agent, Steve Zucker, there is truth to the 
rumor that Kleenex, the company that makes tissue paper, has approached Zucker 
about a possible endorsement contract for McMucous. 
</P>
<P>
The moral: Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be boring. 
</P>
<P>
The morality: Reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
The morale: For the Chargers (3-6), great now. They ended a four-game losing 
streak by upsetting Philadelphia last Sunday, 20-17, on a 49-yard field goal by 
Chris Bahr with four seconds remaining. For the Raiders (5-4) morale is even 
higher. They have won four of their last five. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that life around the Chargers was so much easier the first time they 
played the Raiders nine weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bo "You-Don't-Know-Diddley" Jackson was still in a Kansas City baseball uniform 
then. Marcus Allen was healthy and worlds less dangerous than Jackson. And the 
only thing phlegmatic about McMahon was his postgame press conference after the 
Raiders beat the Chargers, 40-14. That's when he said he could have gone back 
into the game when Charger Coach Dan Henning yanked him trailing by just two 
touchdowns. Then backup quarterback David Archer said McMahon asked to come out 
of the game. Henning subsequently gave several versions. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has dogged the Chargers ever since. 
</P>
<P>
After two games, their owner, Alex Spanos, criticized the defense for playing 
too much "three-man prevent." Since then only one team, the 8-1 New York 
Giants, has allowed fewer points than the Chargers. In the last two games the 
Chargers have sacked opposing quarterbacks 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
This guy Spanos, maybe he knows his onions. 
</P>
<P>
From weeks Five through Eight the Chargers lost four straight games in which 
they had a chance to win or tie on their last possession. The day after the 
last of those losses, McMahon blew his nose in the face of a writer. And while 
many people turn paler every time the incident is retold, this much is 
undeniable: Nothing any of the Chargers have done before or after has been 
talked about more. 
</P>
<P>
Now come the re-tooled Raiders, a team more into flaring tempers than flaring 
nostrils. They have a different coach than they did Sept. 10. They have the 
multi-talented Jackson, who has gained 467 yards in the four games since his 
return. They have monster pass rusher Howie Long happy and healthy again. And 
they have a rushing defense that has allowed 3.5 yards per carry since Art 
Shell replaced Mike Shanahan as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Art's a little bit more relaxed (than Shanahan)," says Jay Schroeder, the 
quarterback who probably will start in place of Steve Beuerlein. Beuerlein 
injured his knee two weeks ago in a Raider victory over the Redskins, 37-24. 
Schroeder started in last week's, 28-7, victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
In the first encounter between these teams the Raiders picked ceaselessly on 
Charger cornerback Sammy "The Way Out" Seale, a former Raider. Wide receiver 
Willie Gault, working almost exclusively against Seale, caught four passes for 
131 yards and a touchdown. But Seale hasn't been beaten deep since. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game it was like, 'We're the big bad Chargers, we'll kill these 
guys,' " Seale says now. "Now I'm more realistic. I've been wearing a target 
for seven weeks. If I was an offensive coordinator, I'd throw at me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Unless that offensive coordinator happens to have Jackson back in action. "If 
you tell me we'll be able to keep Bo Jackson to 10 yards in his first five 
carries, I'd take it," says Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. "But if you 
couldn't guarantee what those next five carries would be, I'm not so sure I'd 
take that." 
</P>
<P>
Last week Jackson rushed for 159 yards on just 13 carries, including a 92-yard 
burst that made him the first player in NFL history to score on the ground from 
more than 90 yards twice in his career. Two years ago he did it from 91 yards 
away at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have brought Jackson along slowly since his return from baseball, 
allowing him to find his football "shape" at his own pace. He has averaged less 
than 16 carries per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Like they say," Shell says, "Bo knows football. Bo knows baseball. Bo knows it 
all. But the thing Bo knows best, is Bo." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I don't think we've played against a better back, because of his 
size and speed," says Charger outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal, who has 
five-and-a-half sacks in his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers know the Raiders are their arch-rivals. And they don't deny it, 
even though the manual says you're supposed to treat every game the same . . . 
each counts just as much in the standings . . . on any given Sunday . . . these 
guys are all professionals . . . et cetera . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The rivalry is not only divisional," says Henning, a former Charger 
quarterback. "It's geographical and it's historical." History shows the Raiders 
have won seven of the last nine. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of the Chargers' 47-man roster are new to the team since 1988. But, 
Henning says, "even though they can't give you dates and times, they know it's 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's Charger-Raider game (kickoff 5 p.m.) is a sellout, which means the 
ESPN-TV broadcast can be seen locally. . . . The Charger rushing defense, which 
ranks 16th in the league, gave up a season high 178 yards rushing to the Eagles 
last week. Philadelphia entered that game ranked fourth in rushing offense. 
This week the Raiders rank fourth in rushing offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAKING A STAND

After two games, the Chargers had allowed 74 points, second most in the NFL 
behind Pittsburgh's 92. Since then has been quite different. A look at the

COLLEGE FOOTBALL;

<P>
THE HEISMAN TROPHY IS STILL UP FOR GRABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a vacancy where the Heisman Trophy front-runner ought to be. Ballots 
were mailed this week to voters, but with a handful of games remaining until 
the Dec. 2 ceremony at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York, there is no 
clear choice for the distinction as the best college football player in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Riska, the executive director of the Heisman Committee, said he does not 
remember a race that has been so ill-defined so late in the season. Among the 
choices are a quarterback at a school on probation, Andre Ware of Houston, and 
a quarterback who is more accurately a running back, Tony Rice of Notre Dame. 
Major Harris of West Virginia, Anthony Thompson of Indiana, Emmitt Smith of 
Florida, Dee Dowis of Air Force, Raghib Ismail of Notre Dame and Darian Hagan 
of Colorado also qualify as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 28 years and I don't remember anything that has been so wide 
open," Riska said. ". . . I guess the next couple of weeks will make it 
clearer. Unless it makes it more confused." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the lack of a favorite is that the best candidates, 1988 winner 
Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State and Miami quarterback Steve Walsh, opted for 
the NFL despite another year of college eligibility. It's the sort of year that 
could result in an argument, joining much-debated past recipients such as 
Auburn quarterback Pat Sullivan (1971). 
</P>
<P>
Each of the most frequently mentioned candidates has as many drawbacks as 
accomplishments, and some key late games could decide it. Notre Dame, for 
instance, travels to Penn State on Nov. 18 and to Miami on Nov. 25. Rice has 
been maligned for not having classic throwing ability or dominant statistics; 
he's the team's leading rusher, but with only 653 yards. He has six 
interceptions and only two touchdown passes, yet he has not lost a game in two 
years and is 25-2 as a starter. An impressive late performance could clinch it 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
Ware is in an awkward position, because no player at a school on probation has 
ever won the trophy. But his statistics are so extravagant -- 263 of 417 for 
3,413 yards and 36 touchdowns -- he might overcome that stigma. Thompson, the 
Indiana tailback, stumbled the last couple of weeks, being outgained by Tony 
Boles of Michigan and Blake Ezor of Michigan State. But he has set the NCAA 
career touchdown record (59), previously held by Army's Glenn Davis and Pitt's 
Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
The others also are debatable. Harris's 1,618 yards passing and 661 yards 
rushing are impressive, but he fumbled three times against Penn State last week 
in his chance to shine. Smith is the nation's leading rusher with 1,214 yards 
on 203 carries, but he has been victim of the maelstrom in the Gators' program, 
with Coach Galen Hall resigning after admitting to NCAA violations. And Dowis 
and Hagan have fought obscurity all season. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it hard for Riska to know whom to invite to the ceremony. "If it was 
too clear-cut, no one would be interested, right?" Riska said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Coach Bill McCartney has provoked controversy in Boulder by agreeing 
to speak at an anti-abortion rally last week. McCartney, a born-again 
Christian, has agreed to appear on behalf of Operation Rescue, an organization 
that stages protests and blockades at abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney, who this fall acknowledged that the late quarterback Sal Aunese 
fathered a boy born out of wedlock to his daughter, Kristin, said the 
appearance is a matter of conscience. But he said he did not condone violence 
or breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is such that I can't stand by in good conscience and not speak," 
McCartney said. "I didn't volunteer, they came and asked me to speak, and in 
good conscience I feel a responsibility to speak. My position on it is that I 
support Operation Rescue, however I don't support anybody in the organization 
or in the country who uses violence, or who doesn't have love at the throne of 
their position on this." 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Notre Dame was in the unenviable position of hosting 2-6 Southern 
Methodist Saturday. SMU is in its first season of play since its program was 
canceled for two years by the NCAA. The Mustangs have 74 freshmen on the 
92-player roster, 17 of them starters. The Irish must find a tactful way to get 
through the game without being accused of running up the score or patronizing 
the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
SMU has been outscored 354-133 in eight games, including a 63-12 defeat by 
Texas A&amp;M last week and a 95-21 drubbing by Houston three weeks ago. Notre 
Dame Coach Lou Holtz said winning the game is his primary objective, but he 
acknowledged how to coach his team without running up the score and how to lay 
off without telling his team to lay down are touchy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win," Holtz said before the game. "I know that sounds crazy."

HUNTINGTON BEACH OUT OF PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SCHOOL IS FORCED TO FORFEIT EIGHT VICTORIES AND ITS SHARE OF SUNSET 
LEAGUE TITLE FOR USING AN INELIGIBLE PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Huntington Beach High School's football team forfeited eight victories and its 
share of the Sunset League title and was also ruled out of the Division I 
playoffs by league principals on Saturday for using an ineligible player for 
the entire 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (8-2 overall) had been a tri-champion of the six-team league, 
with Edison and Ocean View at 4-1. The league title was only the third in 22 
years for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By unanimous vote, the principals declared Edison (8-2, 5-0) and Ocean View 
(7-3, 4-1) co-champions of the league despite the difference in their records. 
They also chose Fountain Valley (5-5, 3-2) as the league's third representative 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The principals felt it wasn't fair to strip Ocean View of a championship 
because it had done nothing wrong, so technically, the first- and second-place 
teams are league champions," said Bill Boswell, athletic director of the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's league title is its first since the school opened in 1976. Its 
only loss in the league was against Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach administrators determined on Friday evening that starting 
right tackle David Roman had failed to establish residency within the school's 
attendance area with his parents or a legal guardian; failure to do so is a 
violation of CIF bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, who had transferred from Maryland, has resided in Huntington Beach with 
his older brother, Tony, since enrolling at Huntington Beach High on Aug. 16. 
Roman's mother remained in Maryland trying to sell her home. 
</P>
<P>
"His mother filed a declaration of residency in August that he (Roman) would 
live with his brother while she returned to Maryland to sell her home," 
Huntington Beach principal Gary Ernst said. "We forgot about the matter, 
figuring she would sell the home. It was over and done with as far as we were 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The question of Roman's eligibility did not surface until last week, when he 
petitioned Southern Section officials for a fifth year of eligibility. He is 
listed in the school's football program as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"As early as Friday morning, I was convinced the boy was living with his 
mother," Ernst said. "It wasn't until I received a call from (Southern Section 
Administrator) Bill Clark at 4:30 Friday that I became aware there might be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the league's six schools in the Huntington Beach Union 
High School District met Saturday morning to determine Roman's eligibility 
status and the league's order of participants for the Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
All agreed Roman was ineligible and that Huntington Beach would forfeit eight 
victories and its league title. But the principals also voted to declare Edison 
and Ocean View co-champions and declared Huntington Beach as the third 
representative in the playoffs despite an 0-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to comment on the logic of the decision," Boswell said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Fountain Valley immediately filed an appeal with the Southern 
Section, and the league's representatives reconvened at 2 p.m. in Cerritos with 
Commissioner Stan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"The principals voted to reverse their decision based on their league's 
constitution for determining playoff participants," Thomas said. "The original 
decision was made improperly. They overlooked their own constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe was visibly shaken throughout the 
proceedings. "As far as I'm concerned, everything was done properly (during the 
season)," Pascoe said. "It's too bad we've had a great season taken away 
because of a misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said he didn't sleep well Friday night because he 
was wondering how to tell his players they had lost the championship because of 
another school's mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers (won-loss records) may not add up to co-champions, but it's fair," 
he said. "I wasn't looking forward to telling my players they had lost our only 
league title in the school's history. That could have been ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner spent most of Saturday trying to locate his 
assistant coaches to tell them the Barons were in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to create some long hours, but the players are really fired up to 
be back in the playoffs," said Milner, who led Fountain Valley to the Division 
I title last year.

MUCKENTHALER'S CAROUSEL EXHIBIT RECALLS A TIME WHEN ELABORATE, FANCIFUL, 
HARDWOOD HORSES LET DREAMS TAKE FLIGHT

They've been turned by men and by horses, by steam and by electricity. But the 
real power of the American carousel has come from daydreams. 
</P>
<P>
The ups and downs of the merry-go-round are traced in "Carousels: The Tangible 
Fantasy of Charles Looff," a collection of antique figures and memorabilia on 
exhibit at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center through Dec. 30. Curated by Scott 
Ringwelski and Robbi Rustuen of Long Beach, the show traces the evolution of 
the ride through Looff, who, during the late 1800s and early 1900s, brightened 
the lives of the working folk with his glittering, spinning machines. 
</P>
<P>
"When carousels were new, they were considered a white-knuckler ride," 
Ringwelski said. "In a gray, industrialized society where there was very little 
music and color, people saw them as something big, fast, elaborate. By riding 
the carousel, you could become a Pony Express rider on the frontier, or a 
knight in shining armor, or a circus performer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance to let your dreams take flight. Three minutes of total 
fantasy, all for the price of a carousel ride." 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from six private collections across the West, the Muckenthaler exhibit 
ranges from a pair of weathered hand-carved panthers (1890) to a carefully 
restored gold-winged Pegasus (1915) and a prancing stallion (1880) with a coat 
of bright green paint and a breastplate of sparkling "jewels." 
</P>
<P>
"Carousels are a chunk of history," said Ringwelski, who has studied the topic 
for more than 14 years. "You can look at a carousel and see, frozen in wood, 
something that was a trend of a particular time or place. Carved in the 
trappings of the horses are the story of the average person . . . their hopes, 
their fears, their fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
A 1912 black stallion with a six-gun and blanket-roll across its gold-trimmed 
saddle glamorizes the Pony Express riders of the dime novels. A foursome of 
noble giraffes built in 1908 remembers America's turn-of-the-century 
fascination with the exotic mysteries of Africa. And a 1905 armored horse, 
complete with chemfron (head protector) and crinit (neck armor), demonstrates 
the nation's turn-of-the-century romance with Medieval lore.

Actually, the first carousel was born in Medieval times. As the story goes, 
while the knights were showing off their horsemanship at fancy tournaments, 
squires and pages, lacking their own horses, developed a crude, hand-turned 
machine on which they imitated their lords' jousting. In 1673, Raphaelle 
Folyarte capitalized on the idea with his "Royalle Carousell," a contraption 
that he promised would "not only afford great pleasure . . . but sufficient 
instruction to all ingenious horsemanship with all the usual practices 
thereof." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, variations on Folyarte's machine were the hit of European country fairs. 
Between 1860 and 1885, English engineer and tinkerer Fredrick Savage 
revolutionized the carousel, introducing the first steam-powered machine and 
"Savage Motion," an overhead crank system that allowed the figures to "leap" in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Savage also patented the mechanism that made his carousels rotate clockwise, 
which is why virtually all English machines (called "roundabouts," a term that 
evolved into "merry-go-rounds") move that direction. Those that turned 
counterclockwise essentially were blatant attempts to circumvent Savage's 
patents. 
</P>
<P>
For the further trivia-minded, Rustuen explained that "carousel" generally 
refers to the larger and more elaborate, permanent machines that have up to 
five concentric rings of carved figures. The "merry-go-round" tends to be a 
smaller, more portable version found at traveling fairs and circuses. 
</P>
<P>
Looff, a New York furniture carver, jumped on the merry-go-round craze with his 
first carousel figures in 1875. With their fiery poses and brilliant trappings, 
his finely crafted animals captured the imagination of the everyman, while the 
music from the carousel's band organ provided a free concert for riders and 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people couldn't afford musical instruments then. They were toys for the 
rich," noted Ringwelski. "Then Looff came in with these amazing band organs 
that created the sound of a 50-piece band. They were like the Pied Piper of 
Hamelin. They'd just reach out and draw people in." 
</P>
<P>
By 1880, one of Looff's dream machines was making waves on Coney Island, where 
it whirled in the ballroom of the elegant Feltman's Ocean Pavilion. It reigned 
supreme until 1893, when a Ferris Wheel, twinkling with hundreds of newfangled 
electric lights, was installed next door. (To recapture the glitter-hungry 
crowds, resort owner Charles Feltman placed blinking carbon filament bulbs 
behind the horses' jewels.) 
</P>
<P>
Ringwelski and Rustuen's study of carousels got into full swing in the late 
1970s, when through their office window, they watched the decay and dismantling 
of The Pike, an amusement park near downtown Long Beach. Once one of the 
country's premiere entertainment centers, The Pike was home to an original 
Looff carousel and Hippodrome, a cavernous structure that protected the machine 
from the elements. The entire site was razed by 1978. Only the Hippodrome, 
which now houses an electrical bingo game, still stands. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, they came out and took down the carousel. Just like that, it was 
gone. We wondered if anyone realized the loss," Ringwelski recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to learn its fate, Ringwelski and Rustuen traced the machine to a 
garage in Pomona. Most of the figures had been sold to collectors and dealers. 
Undaunted, the pair continued their research, and have written a book on 
carousel history, "Carousels: The Tangible Fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
"Looff was something of a revolutionary," Ringwelski said. "He pretty much 
founded the amusement (park) industry as we know it. But he was always running 
afoul of people. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, before the introduction of steam power, he used horses to pull 
the carousels around," he added. "But then the animal rights people got on him 
for being inhumane, so he hired men to do it. Apparently that was OK." 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the question of modesty. 
</P>
<P>
"The Victorians frowned on men and women touching in public," Ringwelski said. 
"So here comes Looff with this machine that actually encourages a gentleman to 
put his arm around a lady's waist to keep her from falling off. He got a lot of 
flak for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he created a snowshoe saddle for the horses so the ladies could ride 
sidesaddle, but even that got him in trouble. I mean, my goodness, you could 
see their ankles!" 
</P>
<P>
From his factory in Brooklyn, and later from Crescent Park, one of several 
family-owned amusement centers, Looff manufactured machines for customers along 
the East Coast. In 1907, the first Looff carousel to spin west of the Rockies 
was installed in Seattle's Luna Park. That machine, salvaged when the park 
burned down in 1913, was installed at Long Beach's Shoreline Village shopping 
center in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In 1910, Looff and his family also headed West. They made their home at The 
Pike, setting up housekeeping in an apartment in the carousel Hippodrome. 
Charles Looff died in 1918. By the late 1920s, said Ringwelski, the American 
carousel business was on its last legs too. 
</P>
<P>
"When the roller coaster and other thrill rides came along, people started 
thinking of the carousel as something for old folks and kids," he said. 
"Gradually, the factories stopped making them." 
</P>
<P>
The last wooden carousel was made in 1934. Today, only a handful of 
manufacturers make the rides, mass-producing the figures from fiberglass or 
cast aluminum. According to Ringwelski, of the nearly 6,000 wooden carousels 
that once operated in the U.S., only about 150 remain, including the Looff 
carousels at Shoreline Village, San Diego's Seaport Village and the Santa Cruz 
boardwalk. 
</P>

 "Carousels: The Tangible Fantasy of Charles Looff" continues through Dec. 30 
at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. Hours: 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. Information:

RANDY LEWIS: A FRIEND OF ORANGE COUNTY MUSIC SCENE PULLS UP STAKES TO TRY HIS 
LUCK IN GLITTER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County rock lost a tireless booster of its alternative-music scene with 
last week's departure of promoter Jim Palmer for, of all places, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But true to his well-deserved reputation as a champion of local music, the 
first words out of his mouth, speaking by phone from Sin City, were: "I think 
it will be interesting. And I hope I can tap into the local scene here -- or 
get one going." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer has abandoned his digs here in citrus paradise, where he had worked as a 
band manager, booking agent, nightclub manager, record label chief, independent 
promoter and all-around friend of local music. He has accepted a job as a 
booking agent and promoter at Calamity Jane's, a concert club taken over this 
summer by Gary Folgner, owner of the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and the 
Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
He sees it as a good career opportunity, where he will get to work with bigger 
acts and agents than he's been accustomed to here. And he promised that he's 
not cutting all ties to Orange County. He will continue working with several 
bands he helped nurture, including National People's Gang, Imagining Yellow 
Suns, Eggplant and others. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Palmer will be back next month to oversee the annual "Orange 
County Artists for the Needy" benefit concert, an event he started five years 
ago to work as a food- and fund-raiser for disadvantaged Orange Countians as 
well as a friendly gathering and celebration for local musicians. This year's 
show will be held Dec. 19 at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the reasons Palmer cited for his decision to leave the county are the 
same ones that plague struggling musicians and artists trying to carve out a 
career in this affluent region that is "affordable" to an ever-shrinking 
segment of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to get my family and personal life together and that just wasn't 
possible in Orange County because of the money it costs to live there," Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Within three days of arriving in Las Vegas Nov. 3, Palmer said, 
he found a place that he and his girlfriend will be renting. "It's a new 
townhouse with two bedrooms, two baths, a wood-buring fireplace, washer and 
dryer and the master bedroom has a sunken bath. Something like this would cost 
$1,600 in South Orange County; we're paying under $500. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is a big difference living here. We live in an apartment complex (in 
Fountain Valley) surrounded by $350,000 homes, and we're paying $675 a month 
for an apartment that is 25 years old. It's a nice neighborhood, but the 
apartment is starting to get run down." 
</P>
<P>
"We are each making $24,000 to $25,000 a year but out here you can do so much 
more with that; here I can afford to have a family. I've lived in Orange County 
for about 24 years, and I'm afraid the place is going to end up like Los 
Angeles and New York (where there are) too many people on top of each other, 
and people forget about the way people are supposed to treat each other." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, an ex-Marine Corps corporal, also said the sense of increasing urban 
violence in Orange County has him worried. "A couple of things started scaring 
me. A stone's throw from my house we had a drive-by shooting; this was at a 
roller rink and fun center where kids go. . . . It's getting crazy with the 
traffic and all these people." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he also spoke proudly, and optimistically, about the improving 
state of the Orange County music scene, which has been languishing without a 
solid communal center for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was noticing before I left a splurge of new local clubs starting to happen 
-- there are three or four. It's time for that to happen. I think (original 
music) is going to be a lot more accepted." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed no qualms about trading the often frustrating but equally 
exhilarating Orange County music scene for the Lounge Lizard capital of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"That (casino showroom entertainment) is fine for the tourists. But the people 
who live here need a musical outlet also. And some of the tourists might 
recognize some of the names we'll be bringing in and listen. When I come to 
Vegas, I don't necessarily want to see Engelbert Humperdinck. 
</P>
<P>
"The people (in bands) I've talked to are really excited about it (because 
Calamity Jane's) is a concert venue, not part of a hotel. A lot of people in 
the entertainment business would like to work in Vegas . . . if they could 
expect a normal, regular concert club." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference Palmer said he has noticed between Southland musicians 
and those in Las Vegas is that "a lot of musicians here can earn $2,000 to 
$3,000 a week playing covers (of Top 40 hits) two or three nights at a week at 
the Aladdin. So why should they want to come down here and get $100 to open for 
the Del Fuegos? But I'm sure there are some people who are in rock bands that 
are something besides lounge acts. I haven't seen any garage bands yet, but I 
haven't been here long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the town's appetite for middle-of-the-road performers such as Wayne 
Newton, Palmer plans to apply the perspective he honed in Orange County working 
with clubs from the now-defunct Spatz and Safari Sam's to more-recent 
affiliations with Bogart's and the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big university here (the University of Nevada, Las Vegas). I think 
this can be a very successful club, and one of the reasons it hasn't exploded 
yet is the lack of having someone here on a full-time basis. There have already 
been some pretty successful things with Jerry Jeff Walker, King Swamp, the Del 
Fuegos, Concrete Blonde and the BoDeans. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is going to be trying to expose people to these things and trying to 
build a scene." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's loss is Las Vegas's gain. But come to think of it, what more 
appropriate place to take the gamble?DR, Dennis Lowe / Los Angeles Times

DIANNE KLEIN: FOLLOWING THE SOUND OF TOM-TOMS TO THE LAIR OF A STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He starred in the movie "Rain Man." He's one of Hollywood's hottest young sex 
symbols. And what would you do if you heard he was living in South County? 
</P>
<P>
Right. So I put aside more trivial concerns and headed straight for Laguna 
Hills' Nellie Gail Ranch, where everybody says Tom Cruise and his actress wife, 
Mimi Rogers, have moved in. The word is spreading through this enclave of 
million-dollar homes faster than a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
OK, well, no one has actually seen him, not like in person or anything, but 
their friends have, or their friend's friends have. Or at least that's what 
they say. Could all these people be wrong? 
</P>
<P>
So off I went, in search of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
First in my path was the mail carrier, quite a stroke of luck. For me, that is. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he definitely lives here," the carrier says, nodding a vigorous yes. "Only 
his name is not Tom Cruise. His real name is, like, really long. It was in 
People magazine." 
</P>
<P>
So that explains it. I hadn't noticed any decorative "Casa Cruise" signs or 
anything like that hanging over any doorways. This might be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets his mail delivered under the other name," the carrier allows. "I've 
talked to another carrier who had a certified letter for him and Tom Cruise 
came to the door and signed it." 
</P>
<P>
The carrier I was talking to, however, had not seen Tom personally. And, no, 
the exact street address was not readily available. To the carrier or myself. 
</P>
<P>
And, besides, I'm not the first person to flag down this employee of the U.S. 
Postal Service to ask directions to Tom's place. It happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, Nellie Gail resident Anita Goodman recalls, someone was 
asking her if she had run into Tom Cruise. No, she had not. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think I'd be more star-struck if it were Cher," she says, pausing for a 
moment atop Dostoevski, her 4-year-old star dressage horse, not far from the 
local stables. 
</P>
<P>
But what had I heard, she wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they all want to know, of course. Everyone from respectable 
businessmen to fabulously wealthy homeowners to checkers at the local 
supermarket are trading on information about Tom and Mimi -- mostly Tom. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely one of my favorite actors," says Tia Pariambada at nearby Mail 
Boxes Etc. "I have a friend who lives in Nellie Gail and she knows where the 
house is." Pariambada doesn't happen to know herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Some friends of mine saw him at church at St. Timothy's over on Crown Valley," 
says Paul Snyder, manager of the Video City closest to Nellie Gail where, for 
what it's worth, Tom Cruise's "Cocktail" has overtaken "Top Gun" in rentals. 
"Rain Man," Tom's latest biggie, wasn't mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends didn't talk to him, but they're sure it was him," Snyder says. 
"People were crowding around him and everything." 
</P>
<P>
But how can he be sure it was really Tom? 
</P>
<P>
"My friends don't lie," he says, a tad indignant. "They didn't talk to him 
because they didn't want to bother him." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over at St. Timothy's, a Catholic church with 1,500 parishioners, a 
spokeswoman who declines to give her name says the word on Tom is that he's 
been spotted at Mass and that he lives in Nellie Gail. Neither he nor Mimi are 
on the membership roster, however. Not that that really mans anything. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the gals said that their kid went to school with someone who lives down 
the block from him," says one Mission Viejo woman, who, because she is a 
respectable married woman with children, begged for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, we had our little sewing group and I walked in and one of the gals 
said, 'You ready to go?' And next thing I know we're all piling into one of the 
vans -- there were like 12 of us -- and we drove past what was supposed to be 
his house," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Mediterranean-style house, gated, and there was a white limo in the 
driveway. But there was this teen-ager, a Japanese boy, shooting baskets in the 
driveway, so we were saying, 'Who could that be?' Later, I heard a rumor that 
there was a Japanese exchange student staying with him." 
</P>
<P>
This woman also confides that, not being able to stand it, she herself queried 
personnel at Von's Pavilions, just across the freeway from Nellie Gail in 
Mission Viejo, where Tom and Mimi have reportedly been spotted in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to set my heart to rest," she says. "But when I asked the 
checker, 'Have you seen Tom Cruise shopping in here?' she just burst out 
laughing. I guess if I was a sex symbol I wouldn't do my own grocery shopping 
either. . . . But they did say they saw Mimi in there." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I'm sorry to say, I couldn't get them to fess up to any such thing at 
Pavilions. Checker Kathy Oltmanns did add, however, that customers have told 
her they've spotted Tom riding his horse on El Toro Road and cruising in his 
red Ferrari or whatever it's supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that he comes in here to shop Friday and Saturday nights, late at 
night," she says. "I haven't seen him myself. If I did, I'd probably be on the 
red line calling to see if it's really him, but I wouldn't make a fool of 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Checker Cindy Young recalls the night not long ago when a stretch limo pulled 
up in front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says, 'Oh, they're here!' We really had the customers rolling." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't them, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Gail resident Mark Monin offers the theory, popular among the locals, 
that Tom is temporarily staying with his aunt while awaiting completion of an 
even more fabulous house on the other, more southern side of Nellie Gail. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had young girls driving by, wondering where he lives," Monin says. "We 
had some exchange students come from Spain, and they heard about it and wanted 
to see where he lives. My wife thinks she knows where the house is. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in real estate, so I'd love them to be here," he adds. "Don Sutton just 
moved out." 
</P>
<P>
So that was Day One. A bit inconclusive. And Tom's people in Los Angeles still 
hadn't gotten back to me. 
</P>
<P>
But the next morning, I make a call to the Laguna Hills post office and get yet 
another mail carrier on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I get his mail sometimes," he says. "But all I know is there's a big 
black dog that lives there. That's what I'm worried about." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so this guy has not seen Tom Cruise personally either. But he did see a big 
black dog. How much more proof do you need?

MEASURE N BACKERS TO CLARIFY ROLE OF SHELDON 
</P>

<P>
Leaders of the victorious campaign for Measure N, an anti-homosexual rights 
initiative, have called a news conference on Monday to clear up issues 
surrounding the involvement of the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon in their campaign and 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Values Coalition members are discounting statements from Sheldon 
indicating that he was responsible for their success. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheldon seems to be taking credit for our hard labor. It couldn't be further 
from the truth," coalition President Scott Peotter said after the election. The 
Irvine Values Coalition is not officially affiliated with Sheldon's statewide 
Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Measure N, which excludes homosexuals from protection under the city's 
anti-discrimination law, passed 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
Measure N opponents frequently complained of "outside forces" -- referring to 
Sheldon -- influencing the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At a post-election victory party, Sheldon told the Irvine World News: "I've 
been in it up to here," gesturing to his chin. "We just couldn't let the other 
side know it until now." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the election, Sheldon held a press conference claiming that he 
helped plan strategy for the Irvine Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Shea, campaign manager for Yes on N, said on Thursday that Sheldon's 
only involvement was to walk precincts with his son and attend the victory 
party. "We won it as a grass-roots effort. We owe more to (Republican Rep. 
William) Dannemeyer than to Lou Sheldon." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon blamed a "misunderstanding in the press" for the apparent 
discrepancies. "We were enthusiastically supporting it with our personal 
feelings and emotions," he said Saturday night. "I said all along I was not at 
all responsible for the activity. I did not take credit for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we did was send a mailing out to our people to get behind Scott 
Peotter in the last week or two of the campaign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That mailing was not listed on the most recent campaign financial disclosure 
reports. State law requires campaign donations and in-kind contributions to be 
disclosed.

<P>
First, teacher Maya Decker says she was falsely accused on a religious radio 
show of hypnotizing four students in her family life class at Corona del Mar 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Next, some parents charged that condoms were passed out during one of her 
lectures for students to take home -- a charge that was denied by school 
officials, who interviewed students. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was the condom demonstration. Decker used a banana. It got the 
attention of some parents, she admits, including the founder of a traditional 
values group who demanded that the school board discipline her. 
</P>
<P>
"Things really hit the fan. I've never heard the end of it," Decker said. "It 
became a red herring. I don't think the banana is a big problem, especially 
when people are dying of AIDS. If they want to feel victorious about getting 
the banana out of the classroom, great." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Decker, 47, has been under fire by religious and 
conservative political groups who maintain that the family life class she has 
taught for eight years serves impressionable children "a philosophical agenda 
that destroys values and divides families." 
</P>
<P>
Her class also found its way into the school board campaign that culminated 
with Tuesday's election. Although Decker's name was not on the ballot, she 
clearly emerged a winner. 
</P>
<P>
She believes she was effectively vindicated when incumbents in the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District board race defeated two challengers who wanted to 
overhaul the district's sex education program, including her family life class. 
</P>
<P>
"The board election was very important," Decker said after school one day last 
week, shortly before embarking on her usual five-mile hike to relax. "I wanted 
the community at large to say they supported the program, and they did." 
</P>
<P>
Family life, an optional course at Corona del Mar High School, has been taught 
for almost 20 years. Its comprehensive lesson plan now addresses personal 
relationships, dating, marriage, parenting, child development, human sexuality, 
contraception, abortion, abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Decker, who is president of the Orange County chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union and an active member and former head of the 700-member Newport 
Mesa Teachers Federation, claims her critics are ignorant about her class. She 
brings in a wide variety of guest speakers, including homosexuals, pro-choice 
and anti-abortion advocates, contraception experts, family law attorneys and 
married couples with babies. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the course is designed to prepare high school students 
for adulthood and provide them with a broad range of information so they can 
make informed decisions and cope with today's world. 
</P>
<P>
To take Decker's class, students need permission from their parents, who can 
review course materials a week before school begins. About 70 students enroll 
in her two courses every semester. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel what I teach are survival skills -- relationship survival skills," said 
Decker, who has taught for 23 years, almost all of it in Room 246 at Corona del 
Mar. "I get positive feedback, extremely positive feedback from parents and 
students." 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions, however. Some parents and members of the Committee to 
Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE), a traditional values group 
based in Costa Mesa, want her class replaced or revamped to teach abstinence 
and refusal techniques almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
CREATE's literature states that Decker's family life course, as well as other 
sex education classes in the district, shock or entice students "into the abyss 
of an 'anything goes' world of amoral social behavior." 
</P>
<P>
She's "an aberration of the system," said John Gustafson, a founder of CREATE. 
"They say to the students, 'I know you are going to have sex, here's the 
contraceptives, and you can get an abortion.' I bet Decker has not taught a 
refusal technique in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson earlier this year called on the school board to discipline Decker 
when a guest speaker from UC Irvine also used a banana in her class to 
demonstrate a condom. District administrators said the banana had to go. 
</P>
<P>
In the school board election, the group backed candidates Wendy Leece of Costa 
Mesa and Jo Ellen Allen of Corona del Mar, who called for an abstinence-based 
sex education program and a school board that was more responsive to parents' 
concerns. Both were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
CREATE and its followers began monitoring Decker's class last spring, using 
students and adult observers for three consecutive days. Some them did not have 
children in the class. 
</P>
<P>
Decker said the visits created "a three-ring-circus atmosphere" and she fought 
back by taping her lectures and inviting a Newport Mesa Federation of Teachers 
representative and an administrator into her classes. She said none of the 
observers confronted her face to face with their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the school board will take action to adopt a formal policy 
restricting the type of visits members of CREATE have sought. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in and pick the most titillating stuff and not the other information 
which is the bulk of the course," Decker said. "They read sinister intent into 
the most simple things. They have a narrow perspective that is not 
representative of the Christian community." 
</P>
<P>
CREATE's founder responded that outsiders have been turned away from her class 
and the district has not honored promises to turn over class material. 
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly ashamed of what's going on. If they were not ashamed, they 
would let people in. . . . We have not been disruptive," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding Decker began last year when a student complained to 
his parents that four classmates had been hypnotized in her class as well as in 
a psychology class. 
</P>
<P>
The purported incident was recounted on a radio broadcast by Focus on the 
Family, a Pomona-based religious organization, in September, 1988. Included in 
the program was a reading of what was taught in the human sexuality sequence of 
Decker's course, which represents one of six units of course material. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even talk about hypnosis in the class," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
The students, Decker and Corona del Mar High School were not named on the show, 
said Paul Hetrick, vice president of Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
The radio report was followed by the latest banana controversy, charges that 
Decker's class promotes homosexuality, questions about condoms being 
distributed, and demands by CREATE members and other parents that Decker drop 
certain topics from her class. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not agree with the decision, the district removed a lecture on 
human sexual response. 
</P>
<P>
Decker, an avid bird-watcher and board member of the Audubon Society, hikes 
five miles almost every day in the countryside near her Laguna Niguel home. 
</P>
<P>
She is a theatergoer. Sometimes, she says, it reminds her of the controversy 
surrounding her. Last spring when CREATE followers were clamoring to get into 
her classroom, she saw the Arthur Miller play "The Crucible" at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The drama explores the infamous witch hunts that ravaged the Puritan community 
in Salem, Mass., during the last decade of the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is Salem, Mass., in 1692," Decker quipped.

EDUCATION GAP: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Year after year at Sunkist Elementary School in Anaheim, students turn in some 
of the highest scores in the state on the California Assessment Program tests. 
Meanwhile, in Huntington Beach, Oak View Elementary School struggles with 
scores that rank near the bottom. The contrast illustrates the vast differences 
among Orange County schools, disparities that challenge educators even in a 
county known for its consistently above-average scores on the tests. In today's 
Section U, a special report gives school-by-school scores for Orange County 
third, sixth and eighth graders tested last April. The report also examines the 
reasons for the gaps among schools, explains how to interpret the scores and 
explores the debate over their value in measuring academic performance.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: VOTE JUNKIES ELECT TO GET THE RESULTS FIRSTHAND

<P>
Her eyes darting and hands fidgeting, Sherry Baum was clearly nervous. 
</P>
<P>
The first returns were about to come in from Tuesday night's election and Baum, 
seeking reelection to the Coast Community College District board, was at the 
registrar of voters office to watch the democratic process in action. 
</P>
<P>
Baum's only challenger had dropped out of the race -- not soon enough, though, 
to get his name off the ballot -- and absentee returns showed her with a 
commanding 40-point lead. Still, she practically raced to the registrar's front 
counter when clerks posted the first precinct results. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where it's at," said Baum, adding that it was the 10th year she 
awaited election returns firsthand. "I can't stand to sit at a party and have 
people telling me what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
Baum was just one of a few dozen self-proclaimed "election junkies" to sate 
their appetite for political action Tuesday night in the lobby of the 
registrar's office on Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a new set of computer printouts with results was posted, they would 
run to a bank of pay telephones to relay the good -- or bad -- news to friends 
at home or at election night gatherings. I and reporter Wendy Paulson did the 
same for our editors in Costa Mesa, who received returns via computer. 
</P>
<P>
In those stretches between results, people in the registrar's lobby gossiped 
about the unfolding political events or occupied themselves with diversions 
such as strolling back to a public viewing area in the warehouse where ballots 
were being unboxed and counted. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy and I passed part of the time with a miniaturized version of the table 
game "Battleship." We wound up making it only partway through "Battleship," 
however, once the returns began coming at fairly frequent intervals after an 
early delay. 
</P>
<P>
The election watchers began gathering at the registrar's office shortly before 
the polls closed at 8 p.m. The assemblage included an assemblyman's aide, a 
representative of the teacher's union in Orange, and volunteer "runners" for 
candidates whose job it was to telephone them with updated returns. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Throop, 32, was one of the volunteers. Throop, an office manager, was 
representing Joe J. Cherry, an incumbent who unsuccessfully sought reelection 
to the Orange Unified School District board. Throop slumped in a chair and read 
from a book between relaying the bad news to Cherry and his worried camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The candidates want to know," Throop said, squinting up from his book. "It's 
kind of nervous for them, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Throop said he did the same thing during the last election for two other 
candidates to the Orange school board. When I asked Throop if his wife minded 
his staying out like this, he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not married, so it's not a great imposition to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seated near Throop was Al Peraza, 56, a member of the Anaheim City School 
District board who stayed up late to monitor the returns even though he was not 
running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just interested in seeing who is elected," Peraza said. "I like to get a 
firsthand account." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that he had a wedding ring on but was alone, I asked Peraza why he 
wasn't accompanied by his wife. Peraza laughed and said, "She just stays home." 
</P>
<P>
Baum, however, had plenty of company. Both her husband and grown son tagged 
along. They kept reassuring her throughout the night, even though it was clear 
her reelection was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the outcome of this election a virtual certainty, Baum could not pull 
herself away from the registrar's office until the last returns were counted 
after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being a junkie," she joked to a friend at the same table where I was 
playing "Battleship." 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotta wait for just one more return."

1ST-STAGE SMOG ALERT TARNISHES A SUMMERY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Temperatures rose into the 80s across Orange County on Saturday and many 
residents turned the November day into a reprise of summer, but the sunshine 
was marred by murky air that prompted authorities to declare a first-stage smog 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
As some residents cooled their toes by returning to the beach, the mercury 
topped out at 81 degrees in Santa Ana, but weather officials said today and 
Monday may be a bit cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with Weather Data Inc., said a bulge of high 
pressure over the desert that has sent mild Santa Ana winds whirling into 
Orange County in recent days was beginning to break up, ushering in sea breezes 
that should cool the region. 
</P>
<P>
Night and morning low clouds will combine with hazy sunshine in the afternoon 
today, with temperatures along the coast expected to be between 65 and 75 
degrees and into the low 80s inland, Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District declared a first-stage smog 
alert Saturday morning for central Orange County after the area's Pollutant 
Standards Index level reached 207. The district issues first-stage smog alerts 
when PSI levels are from 200 to 275. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's air quality improved slightly in the afternoon when the alert was 
downgraded to "unhealthy" conditions after the PSI went down to 160. The Santa 
Ana winds probably contributed to Saturday's air problems, said Thomas 
Eichhorn, a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The index measures the amount of carbon monoxide, ozone or nitrogen dioxide in 
the air, Eichhorn said, noting that authorities recommend people stay indoors 
and refrain from heavy exercise during periods of unhealthful air quality.

<P>
Police are seeking witnesses to a bicycle accident in Buena Park involving a 
17-year-old boy who hit a tree -- and who may have been forced off the road by 
a car. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Kim of Buena Park was in critical but stable condition, complaining of 
head and neck injuries after the accident at La Palma Avenue and El Monte 
Drive, a police spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said Kim told police that he was riding his bike to the library 
about 11:30 a.m. Friday when a car came at him and he hit the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police said they would like anyone who may have seen the accident to 
call the department. In particular, they are interested in talking with a woman 
who phoned the police 911 emergency hot line to report the accident but was not 
at the scene when officers and paramedics arrived.

HOLLYWOOD REMOTE -- AND ON A BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: VALENCIA STUDIOS OFFERS BIG, NO-FRILLS PRODUCTION SPACE AT A 
FRACTION OF THE GOING RATE IN HOLLYWOOD OR BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The license plate on the 10-year-old Mercedes owned by Robert Thompson, founder 
and president of Valencia Studios, reads "BBY MOGL." He might just become a 
baby mogul. The 35-year-old Thompson has developed a remote version of 
Hollywood in the Santa Clarita Valley by offering film and TV producers big, 
cheap, no-frills studios that have been fashioned out of industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when independent production companies are under increasing pressure 
to contain costs, Valencia Studios offers production space for 30% to 50% less 
than the established studios in Hollywood and Burbank. A sound stage at 
Valencia Studios rents for $9,000 to $30,000 a month, and production office 
space runs about $1.25 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Producers can also cut corners even more by bringing in non-union crews to 
Valencia Studios, whereas the major studios such as Paramount, Universal and 
Disney usually require producers to hire unionized production help. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Target stores of the industry," said Thompson, referring to the 
discount retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Studios has caught on in part because its four buildings and 125,000 
square feet of production space, about 25 miles north of Hollywood, not far 
from the Magic Mountain amusement park, are basically low-cost, converted 
warehouses. Budget-minded producers are increasingly using warehouses as an 
alternative to high-priced Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are doing out in Valencia is industrializing the warehouse concept," 
said TV producer Leonard ("Rags to Riches") Hill. "The concept is a terrific 
one." 
</P>
<P>
TV shows such as "Tour of Duty," a CBS drama about the Vietnam war, and the 
daytime soap "Divorce Court" shoot at Valencia Studios. Horror films such as 
"The Blob" and "Nightmare on Elm Street, Part 4" were shot at Valencia, and the 
sequel to the Oscar-winning film "Chinatown," -- "The Two Jakes," directed by 
Jack Nicholson -- recently completed some filming there as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I love those studios," said Deborah Moore, executive vice president in charge 
of production for New Line Cinema, which produced the "Nightmare on Elm Street" 
films. "The rate was very good for what we need, which is massive amounts of 
warehouse space." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Jaffe, co-executive producer of "Divorce Court," also finds Valencia's 
cheap stages a big draw. "In Hollywood, if you can find the space, they want an 
arm and a leg," he said. "It's either controlled by unions or they have 
ridiculous rules and regulations that hamstring you." The show, which started 
filming at Valencia Studios in September, previously was shot at Sunset-Gower 
Studios in Hollywood, and Jaffe estimated savings of about $10,000 a week by 
filming at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for studio space has been enough for Thompson's three-year-old company 
to be profitable since its first year of operation, he said. Valencia Studios 
is consistently at near-full capacity and does about $3 million to $5 million a 
year in sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lower cost, there are some drawbacks to filming in Valencia. It 
still doesn't have many of the support services that Hollywood offers, such as 
costuming companies and specialized lighting and video shops. And even though 
Valencia Studios falls within the 30-mile radius from Hollywood in which union 
employees -- if they are used on a production -- don't have to be paid for 
their driving time, many people doubt that a small town on the outskirts of Los 
Angeles County can become a legitimate alternative to Hollywood-Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't seriously consider them a competitor to a real studio," said Dan 
Slusser, senior vice president and general manager of Universal City Studios, 
who said his business hasn't been hurt by Valencia Studios. "Why would someone 
want to drive out to Valencia and drive back here to use a wardrobe department 
and then drive back to Valencia? If you work at Universal, you're basically at 
a one-stop shopping service. Time is money." 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson said much of his business comes from servicing the boom in 
entertainment production due to the growth of cable TV and non-network 
syndication, rather than taking business away from the big, established 
studios. Also, producers who have been filming shows in Canada to save money 
are now coming back to the United States now because of the strengthening 
dollar and growth of Canadian unions, and so low-cost studios such as Valencia 
stand to benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a former film student, worked at the Christian Broadcasting Network 
in Virginia Beach, Va., for three years as a fund-raiser before leaving to 
raise money for a motion picture. The film deal never materialized, and 
Thompson and his wife, a professional dancer, landed in Los Angeles in 1983 
"with about $20 in our pockets." 
</P>
<P>
He went to work for GMT Studios, an entertainment company in Culver City, 
managing sales and marketing and spearheading the firm's expansion. But he left 
in 1986 to start his own studio. After raising $1.25 million from a group of 
seven investors, Thompson leased the new industrial buildings at Valencia and 
converted them into studios. He then spent about $1.5 million adding such 
features as soundproofing, lighting equipment and the type of electrical wiring 
needed for productions. He and his wife still own 51% of the firm, and he said 
the original investors have increased their money by tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also recently started a new company, City Studios, which is 
majority-owned by Valencia Studios. City Studios runs a 45,000-square-foot 
studio in Van Nuys, where the upcoming ABC-TV series "Twin Peaks" is filming, 
and a soon-to-be-opened 25,000-square-foot video tape studio in North 
Hollywood. The rents at the two San Fernando Valley studios are about 25% 
higher than Valencia, but Thompson hopes they will capture the large-production 
TV series that Valencia has more difficulty attracting. 
</P>
<P>
In all, his companies own, lease, or manage one million square feet of studio 
space, including 17 sound stages, production offices and room for makeup, 
wardrobe and editing operations. With the new studios in Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood, Thompson hopes his three studios will hit $10 million in sales 
within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
But the expansion to other locations doesn't mean his commitment to Valencia 
has waned, Thompson said. In fact, he is so convinced that Valencia will 
continue to be a success that he's buying the studio buildings there for $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Studios remains a lean operation with just 16 full-time employees, and 
it provides a minimum of services -- maintenance, air conditioning and some 
lighting equipment -- unlike major studios, which often require production 
companies to contract with them for everything from cameras to crews. At 
Valencia, producers bring their own crews and most of their own equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson continues to have new ideas. He envisions Valencia as the start of a 
large consortium of independently run companies servicing the entertainment 
industry. He recently started a company called Stage by Design that knocks down 
and stores sets for production companies, and has begun offering studio 
management services to other warehouse-type studios. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry aren't surprised that Thompson could make a go of 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a shortage of viable, non-union space in town," said a Hollywood 
studio manager who asked not to be identified. "People are shooting in 
warehouses all over town. In that sense, Valencia is a step up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: "When we first got going, about two-thirds of the people in the 
production community thought we wouldn't make it. I'd say that's now down to 
about one-third."

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: GETTING THE RIGHT PITCH FOR HOME ROOFING JOB 
</P>

QUESTION: I want to reroof our house and would like to do the job myself, since 
I have had some experience in working on roofs. Any tips that will help me? For 
instance, what is the easiest way to determine the pitch of my roof? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: That last question gives some cause for concern. Having worked on 
roofs, you should know about such things as determining the pitch. However, it 
is found by measuring how many inches it rises for every foot it runs. Roofs 
with slopes of 4 or 5 inches per horizontal foot are safest and easiest for the 
do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
Steep slopes and high roofs, or those with many angles, dormers or gables, are 
best left to the professional. If you do the job yourself, there are certain 
safety precautions that should be observed. 
</P>
<P>
Wear rubber-soled construction-type shoes for secure footing. Apply the 
shingles on clear days when it is warm but not hot. Do not reroof in wet 
weather or when the temperature is below 40 degrees. Reroof only when the roof 
deck and existing shingles are dry, since moisture makes roofs slippery and 
dangerous. Lift only easy loads. 
</P>
<P>
Secure ladders, top and bottom, and keep the roof surface free of debris. Don't 
allow ladders to come in contact with power lines. And place shingles and tools 
where they won't slide off the roof; but to be sure, keep people away from the 
work area. Besides all these precautions, use your common sense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tools Lose Sharpness From Abuse, Not Use 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm an old carpenter who recently saw an article about the use of sharp 
tools and how to keep them in good condition. I have some advice for people who 
are starting a home workshop and have never worked much with tools. 
</P>
<P>
I learned over the years that sharp tools seldom become dull from usage. Most 
people don't use chisels and things like that often enough to make them dull. 
What makes them dull and damaged is not overuse but abuse. 
</P>
<P>
A good mechanic treasures his tools. When he is finished with one, he places it 
down carefully where it won't come in contact with other tools. He just doesn't 
toss it into a drawer. If it is to go in a drawer, it is placed there. So, if 
you want your cutting tools to stay sharp for a long time, handle them with 
care. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. Good advice.

INTERPRETATION OF CAP SCORES GOES BEYOND RAW NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

California Assessment Program tests, a staple of the state's educational 
efforts for more than a decade, offer telling nuggets of information about 
schools and their progress. But it takes a practiced eye to pick out the 
significance in the results, and experts warn that scores can be easily 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
To help avoid that, educators strongly caution against reading too much 
significance into small yearly shifts in a school's averages. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't tell you much to see that a school or a district has dropped a 
couple of points in any given year," said Fred Lange, director of instructional 
services for the Orange County Department of Education. "You really need to 
look at two or three years to find the trend." 
</P>
<P>
That's because a certain instability is built into the test. Different groups 
of students are tested each year, so that this year's third or sixth or eighth 
graders are compared to last year's. Thousands of new students enter and leave 
the educational system every year, and one year's group of third graders may be 
very different from the next year's. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at results for several years gives a more accurate sense of where a 
school actually stands and helps mitigate factors that can skew results in a 
single test. A three-year sample gives a reasonably clear picture of a school, 
experts say, and though it does not measure the entirety of an academic 
program, it gives analysts plenty to go on. In the Anaheim Union High School 
District, for instance, officials have eyed stubbornly low reading and writing 
scores for years. Eighth-graders were not tested in writing last spring, but 
reading scores are reflected in the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-grade statewide averages in reading have steadily risen for the past 
four years, going from 243 in 1986 to 256 this year. Anaheim's scores have 
remained almost steady at about 260. 
</P>
<P>
Those are not alarmingly low, but they show so little improvement that James 
Cox, the district's director of research and development, said officials are 
embarking on a revamped writing curriculum this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're turning to a more literature-based program," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
While three years of a school's raw CAP scores provide a better sample, they do 
not tell the whole story. Socioeconomic factors hold strong influence on test 
results, so that schools in poor neighborhoods, even if they are doing 
commendable work, will often test lower than their wealthier counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids who live in affluent areas are more educationally advantaged," Cox said. 
Affluent children often have access to books, parents who encourage them to 
read and quiet places to do homework. All of those can help their test scores 
regardless of what is done at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
To take into account those socioeconomic factors, the CAP test assigns schools 
a rating that reflects the educational and professional level of students' 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Third- and sixth-grade tests determine socioeconomic status based on parents' 
professional attainment. A rating of 1 indicates parents who are unskilled 
workers; a 2 indicates semiskilled laborers, and a 3 means parents are employed 
as skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
A five-point scale ranks the educational background of parents with children in 
the eighth and 12th grades. One stands for parents who did not graduate from 
high school; 5 indicates parents with advanced degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The socioeconomic ranking helps educators compare their schools to others of 
comparable means, a comparison generally considered more meaningful than one 
that looks at all schools regardless of their socioeconomic background.

SHOULD A SCHOOL'S QUALITY BE JUDGED BY TEST SCORES? 
</P>

As California Assessment Program scores have gained statewide prominence, they 
have stirred passionate debate among educators, some of whom believe the test 
unfairly lumps all the complexities of education into a bite-sized, shallow set 
of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal belief is that CAP scores are a very useful litmus test," said 
Carol Berg, assistant superintendent for instruction, curriculum and programs 
at Newport-Mesa Unified School District. "But it's totally inappropriate to use 
them to judge a school's whole program, and I shudder to think that when it 
comes to choices, people are judging schools based on their CAP scores." 
</P>
<P>
But judge them they do. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, has made CAP scores a 
cornerstone of his drive for steady educational progress and accountability. 
Orange County educators often hold up the scores as evidence of the county's 
academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Area realtors, who tout the county's educational reputation as a way of luring 
home buyers, also make use of CAP scores. Realtors will often provide 
prospective buyers with the scores to demonstrate a local school's excellence. 
Some even draw up maps showing the CAP scores achieved by schools serving 
certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Colesworthy, owner-broker of Century 21 Coastland Realty in Newport 
Beach, said he takes advantage of his office's proximity to Andersen Elementary 
School, a Newport-Mesa school that topped all other county CAP scores in 
sixth-grade reading. 
</P>
<P>
"You better believe I point to it. I use it all the time," Colesworthy said. 
CAP scores "absolutely" have an effect on potential home buyers, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
That causes mild concern by some civil libertarians, however. In addition to 
telling something about a neighborhood's educational achievement, CAP scores 
are related to a community's affluence and racial makeup. Directing home buyers 
toward high-scoring communities, thus, could have the effect of steering them 
to predominantly white neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyebrows are a little raised," said Linda Burstyn, communications director 
of the Southern California American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn added that she was not aware of complaints about the practice and said 
the ACLU has not researched it in depth. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the CAP scores as achievement yardsticks for schools has 
grown in recent years, mostly as a result of Honig's efforts. The 
superintendent releases results with great fanfare, and educators have 
responded, gearing curriculum to the tests in order to avoid the public 
embarrassment that comes with low rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to be embarrassed by low test scores, you're going to 
intuitively respond to the test by making changes in your curriculum," said 
James Cox, director of research and development for the Anaheim Union High 
School District. The CAP tests question students on elements of the state's 
curriculum, so teaching inside that framework is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with more than two dozen Orange County teachers and education 
officials last week, all endorsed the curriculum guides and agreed that the CAP 
tests help enforce the state's efforts to get schools to adopt them. But CAP 
scores frequently are interpreted as providing an overall judgment on a 
school's performance, and that, critics say, is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gotten blown out of proportion," said Berg, whose Newport-Mesa 
district ranked well above state and county averages in nearly all areas tested 
at all grade levels. "A school's success is being measured entirely by how well 
certain students perform on these tests, and that's just not correct." 
</P>
<P>
Cox strongly supports CAP but says it is important to treat the annual results 
with caution. For while the tests measure a school's program, he said, they 
also gather in volumes of extraneous data that can skew scores. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, whom many educators consider one of Orange County's foremost CAP experts, 
said the test measures at least three variables in addition to the school's 
program: demographics, testing conditions and the degree to which a school's 
curriculum matches the test questions. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is that when a score goes up or a score goes down, the inference 
is that something is going on with the program," Cox said. "That's not always 
the case. Often something is going on with one of the other factors." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Orange County schools often suffer from changing demographics. 
Schools can drop substantially in their CAP scores without changing their 
program at all, simply because they receive a large influx of students who do 
not speak English well. 
</P>
<P>
CAP also uses a complicated brand of analysis, known as "matrix sampling," that 
some educators complain makes it possible for whole schools to suffer as the 
result of very few lagging students. Using matrix sampling, dozens of different 
tests will be given to a classroom of students, who will each complete a 
section of the matrix. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Cox and others said, is that the test more accurately portrays the 
ability of a group of students when that group is very large. In small schools, 
a few low scores can dramatically affect the entire group. 
</P>
<P>
The matrix sample discourages cheating because students sitting next to each 
other will usually not have the same test. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even critics of CAP tests acknowledge that the scores gives educators 
and parents an important tool for holding schools accountable for progress. And 
even in districts that have historically posted low scores, the test has 
supporters, who say that it helps schools identify problem areas and begin the 
complicated task of addressing them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very supportive of CAP," said Vergil Hettick, director of research and 
evaluation for Santa Ana Unified School District. "It helps us target schools 
that need help. Some of ours do, and CAP is making it easier."
