LORD HAROLD CACCIA; BRITISH DIPLOMAT TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lord Harold Caccia, 84, a former British ambassador to Washington. Caccia, 
described by contemporaries as one of the most skilled and effective British 
diplomats of his generation, was assigned to Washington from 1956 to 1961 to 
restore confidence after the crisis over the short-lived invasion of the Suez 
Canal region. 
</P>
<P>
Britain was severely criticized over the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion that 
same year, a response to Egypt's nationalization of the strategic waterway. 
Upon his retirement in 1965, he was made Baron Caccia and became director to a 
number of companies. He also became provost of Eton College. The Caccia family 
originated in Tuscany -- it is mentioned in Canto 29 of Dante's Purgatory -- 
and settled in England in the early 19th Century. The British Foreign Office 
said over the weekend that Caccia died Oct. 31 in Builth Wells, Wales, but did 
not give the cause of death.

1 WORKER KILLED, 2 HURT IN BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One worker was killed and two were injured Sunday when a turbine engine 
exploded at a Kearny Mesa industrial plant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 6:40 p.m. in a work yard at Solar Turbines Inc. on 
Ruffin Road when a compressor undergoing an air pressure test exploded, company 
spokesman Larry Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
The two injured men, who were not identified late Sunday, were taken to Sharp 
Memorial Hospital. One man suffered burns to his shoulder; the other suffered a 
broken wrist and second- and third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
"A cap came off the compressor," Sera said. "I don't know if the cap hit the 
men or the blast of air got them." 
</P>
<P>
Remaining employees were sent home after the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The compressor is normally used to compress natural gas but was undergoing a 
routine test at the time of the explosion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Solar Turbines manufactures gas turbine engines and places them in machines 
that compress gas, generate electricity or pump liquids, Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration will look into the 
accident today, authorities said.

'KEEP THE FLAMES AWAY FROM YOUR CHEVROLET . . . ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cars were moving off the showroom floor at Security Chevrolet in Vista like 
hot cakes, faster than anything sales manager John Quinn had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, nobody was buying them. In a heated rush, salesmen were driving 
spanking-new cars -- and even pushing one vintage model -- to save them from a 
fire that struck the East Vista Way dealership early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze erupted about 9:40 a.m. in a faulty light fixture in the showroom 
ceiling. A salesman heard a couple of weird popping noises. Then, "Blam!" Quinn 
recalled, the ceiling was a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the small showroom was an $11,000 Geo Storm as well as a much more 
valuable vehicle that the dealership had placed on display: a 1956 Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
The car was the prize awarded to the relative of a local resident 34 years ago 
for dreaming up what was to become a famous advertising slogan: "See the U.S.A. 
in Your Chevrolet." 
</P>
<P>
As sparks and pieces of the burning ceiling began falling, the salesmen knew 
they had to move the valuable cars or watch them burn, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
But first they had to move five autos that blocked their way, parked on a porch 
outside the showroom -- including a $37,000 Corvette directly in their path. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into the office and looked in the drawer where we keep the keys to the 
Corvette," Quinn recalled. "They're in a special place because of the value of 
the car. And when I looked, they weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the heat of the moment and I was fishing around the drawer like a 
madman. Finally, my fingers found them." 
</P>
<P>
After moving the Corvette, the salesman rescued the silver and white '56 Chevy 
that the late Albert Merrill of Boston had won for his winning slogan. They 
shoved the car from the blackened showroom without so much as a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to go back inside and push it because we didn't have the keys," Quinn 
said. "The embers were falling, and right after we got the car out, the ceiling 
really started to drop. The only thing that was on our minds was to get the 
hell out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Osce (Tex) Gross, 84, of Vista, whose wife was related to Merrill, said he went 
by the dealership Sunday and was "glad to see the car was still alive." 
</P>
<P>
"That car really means something to this family," he said. "It's a V-8, 
four-door with original upholstery. Everyone who sees that car wants to buy it, 
it's just that special." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said Merrill, his wife's uncle and a bank treasurer in Boston, was the 
kind of man who liked to enter contests and had a way with words. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how he came up with the winning jingle," Gross said. "And Chevy went 
right to the bank with it. You used to hear it on television all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The car stayed in the family after Merrill died several years ago at age 98, 
Gross said. After refurbishing it, Gross and his wife gave the car to their son 
Fred, who runs a Vista insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
While the salesmen said they were glad to have been able to rescue the cars, 
the showroom didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the fire caused about $300,000 damage to the building and 
contents, a figure they said was substantially reduced by the quick actions of 
the salesmen in moving the cars. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived at the fire, they found smoke pouring from the 
showroom and flames flicking from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The firemen were able to protect our office and 99% of our records," said 
Randy Hollingsworth, general sales manager of the 22-year-old dealership. 
"Without our records, we would have been a crippled business." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, yellow Fire Department tape surrounded the empty showroom. But the 
salesmen at Security Chevrolet were still on hand to do what they do best -- 
sell cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, let's take a look at this little V-6 right here in the corner," one 
salesman said, leading a would-be customer by the arm. "It's a real beaut." 
</P>
<P>
Hollingsworth said the dealership was business as usual. "If you want to buy a 
car," he said, "we're opened for business." 
</P>
<P>
The boys on the lot, however, didn't sell any cars at all on Saturday or 
Sunday. But car salesmen are resourceful, Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll have us a little fire sale," he quipped. "That's a real incentive 
for the salesmen. Because if they don't get any sales, they get fired."

MALES IN NATURE FIND FLASHY ADORNMENTS IMPROVE SEX LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
REPRODUCTION: THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT FEMALES OUTWEIGHS THE DISADVANTAGES OF 
ATTENTION-GETTING TRAITS, RESEARCHERS FIND. UC SANTA BARBARA STUDY IS A 
PROTOTYPE FOR WORK OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Male animals have evolved a wide variety of bizarre and elaborate 
characteristics, such as the lion's mane, the peacock's tail and the bright 
coloration characteristic of many male fish. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, these adornments actually decrease the male's ability to survive 
by drawing it to the attention of predators or by impairing its ability to 
fight or escape. So why the window dressing? 
</P>
<P>
Sex -- or ultimately, reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are finding that the disadvantage of obvious adornments is far 
outweighed by the males' increased ability to attract mates and thus propagate 
their genes. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, UC Santa Barbara researchers have demonstrated that females of a 
certain species of fish seem to become more attracted to the male of the 
species when males are fitted with plastic swords on the ends of their tails. 
The findings suggest what may have led to the evolution of a related fish 
species called the swordtail. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists have long been puzzled by the question of how these traits arise 
genetically. Do males evolve traits that females subsequently come to prefer, 
do the traits and the preferences arise at the same time, or do the females 
have a preexisting preference that males evolve in response to? 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that males would develop adornments first because there would 
exist no evolutionary pressure to select for the traits. Most researchers have 
argued that the traits and preferences tend to arise at the same time because 
that seems most logical, and they have developed elaborate theories about how 
the two are linked. 
</P>
<P>
But new results presented last week in the journal Science by biologist 
Alexandra L. Basolo of UC Santa Barbara provide strong evidence that, at least 
in one case, the female's preference arose first and that males adapted to it. 
The study is a prototype of new studies being conducted by evolutionary 
biologists to shed light on sexual preferences in a variety of species. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents a new way of going about these studies," said biologist Michael 
Ryan of the University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're one step closer to understanding what causes these sexual preferences to 
develop," added biologist Douglas Futuyma of the State University of New York 
at Stony Brook. 
</P>
<P>
Basolo has been studying two closely related species of fish: the green 
swordtail, in which males have a sword-shaped extension on their tails, and the 
platy, which has a normal tail. The swordtail and the platy are believed to 
derive from a common ancestor, and biologists believe that the platy is more 
similar to that ancestor -- that it is more primitive. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier studies, Basolo had shown that female swordtails prefer males with 
longer tails. These studies were conducted by using a three-chambered aquarium, 
placing the female in the center and the males on each side. 
</P>
<P>
An observer then monitored courtship behavior, determining which of the males 
the female spent more time close to. Basolo observed that the females spent 
more time near the male with the longer tail. When she cut off part of that 
male's tail so that it was shorter than the other's, the female then began 
courting the previously spurned male. 
</P>
<P>
Basolo then began wondering how the closely related female platy might react to 
tails. To find out, she sewed a plastic sword onto the tail of a male platy and 
determined the female's preference between it and a regular male. 
</P>
<P>
She found that the female spent about twice as much time with the sword-tailed 
male as with the other -- about the same ratio as shown in the swordtail 
species. When she sewed the tail on the other male, it became the preferred 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
Because the platy is much more like the ancestor of the two species, she said, 
"it is clear that the female's preference arose before the appearance of the 
sword" and that preference may have figured in the evolution of the swordtail. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge now is to determine what causes the female's preference. One 
strong possibility is that the tail simply makes the male look bigger; previous 
studies have shown that females of the two species prefer bigger males. But it 
is also possible that the preference arose because the tail resembles a favored 
food object or perhaps because the females see horizontal objects better than 
vertical, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one similar study is known. Ryan is studying two closely related species 
of frog. One makes a mating call composed of a whining noise followed by a 
deep-throated "chuck." The second makes only the whining noise. 
</P>
<P>
Females in the first species prefer males whose chuck has a low vibrational 
frequency because those males tend to be bigger. The ears of the females are 
shaped so that they are especially sensitive to the lowest notes. He has also 
found that females of the second species have a similarly shaped ear, even 
though males do not make the chucking noise. He will report in a forthcoming 
paper that, if he gives males of the second species an artificial chuck with a 
tape recorder, females strongly prefer them. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, biologists are looking for other closely related species to see 
if they too have such preexisting preferences. If the preferences are common, 
researchers will then have to develop new theories about how sexual traits 
develop.

DISCOVERING THE LETHAL SIDE OF HERBS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANTS: COMFREY IS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY DAMAGING TO THE LIVER. MANY OTHER 
POTENTIALLY TOXIC HERBAL PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD, EXPERTS FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES DOWNEY, Charles Downey is a syndicated journalist and magazine 
writer in Fawnskin, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 49-year-old woman had developed a rare liver ailment with symptoms seen 
only in chemotherapy patients, end-stage cirrhosis of the liver and a rare type 
of liver poisoning caused by a substance known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul M. Ridker, a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital at 
Harvard Medical School, knew the woman did not drink and had never undergone 
chemotherapy. He also knew there had never been a case of pyrrolizidine 
poisoning reported in North America. But nothing else explained the woman's 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"We eventually found the woman had been drinking large amounts of comfrey tea 
and taking comfrey pepsin tablets daily for six months," Ridker says. "We later 
analyzed the tea and tablets in the lab and found the preparations contained 
large amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which caused her liver disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvard is a major teaching hospital but it took us four years to link the 
comfrey with the liver disease. My point is, I think the herb problem is much 
larger than physicians realize and that many other such cases are going 
unreported." 
</P>
<P>
Ridker and others now recommend that people avoid food products containing 
comfrey, but their concern is not limited to comfrey. Experts are becoming 
increasingly wary of other herbs, herbal teas and other herbal preparations. 
They are concerned that many potentially toxic herbs may be sold in health food 
stores, drugstores and even supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of herbal products are large -- anywhere from half a billion to a billion 
dollars yearly, according to the the Herb Research Foundation. The sales are 
spurred by claims that comfrey, for instance, is good for wound healing and 
aiding digestion. Other herbs, like aloe, are used in hopes they will soothe 
burns and wounds or remove excess gasses from the gastrointestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
Says William Jarvis, professor of preventive medicine at Loma Linda University 
and president of the National Council Against Health Fraud Inc.: "Herbs can 
actually be very potent medications. However, mother nature doesn't supply a 
standard dose. A herb can be stronger, or weaker, depending on the part of the 
plant consumed, the time of the year it was harvested, how long it has been 
stored and even if it was a dry year when picked." 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of herb products are probably safe, experts say at least 
26 commonly available herbs contain toxic compounds which have caused disease 
in the gastrointestinal, cardiac and nervous systems. Other herbal-caused 
health concerns have ranged from liver failure to skin inflammation to abortion 
to lowered blood pressure to death. 
</P>
<P>
After comfrey, the most dangerous herbs, say Ridker and other experts, are 
buckthorn, pokeroot and teas with pure licorice, all of which may contribute to 
high blood pressure. Teas made with tonka beans, woodruff or elilot, herbs that 
contain organic coumarins, can suppress coagulation. Even every grandmother's 
favorite, sassafras, can be dangerous to the liver because of its high content 
of safrole. 
</P>
<P>
When Ridker looked up articles about the unusual poisoning printed in 
scientific journals, he became even more concerned. He discovered that a woman 
in England had died because she consumed a lot of comfrey tea. In the early 
1970s, a weed containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids fell into some wheat being 
harvested in Afghanistan. When the farmers and their families consumed bread 
made from the contaminated wheat, 25% of the 7,200 villagers developed the 
liver ailment within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Other outbreaks of such poisoning have occurred in Jamaica, Africa and India 
after people consumed comfrey or other plants containing the liver-damaging 
substance. In one case in Switzerland, a pregnant woman drank a tea containing 
pyrrolizidine alkaloids and gave birth to a baby with a damaged liver. 
</P>
<P>
Groundsel and gordolobo, two other widely available herbs, also contain 
pyrrolizidine alkaloids. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, Japan and Canada have banned most comfrey and comfrey products. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating comfrey products and 
considering a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say many consumers regard herbs and other plant products as harmless 
because they grow naturally in our good earth. However, cocaine, opium, tobacco 
and marijuana, which are far from harmless, can all be considered herbs. 
</P>
<P>
R. Frank Chandler, professor of pharmacy and director of the College of 
Pharmacy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, analyzed 65 popular herbs 
such as pokeberry, chamomile, feverfew and cayenne. Chandler then summarized 
the herbs' main ingredients, their major uses, safety and side effects. (See 
chart.) 
</P>
<P>
"The safety of herbs depends on the herb under consideration and how it's 
prepared," says Chandler. "Just because a herb has been used for several 
thousand years for a particular purpose, there's no guarantee it's safe or 
effective. Moreover, there are cases of herbs interacting with prescription 
medications." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because the Federal Drug Administration has classified herbs as food 
products -- and not drugs -- manufacturers are not required to prove that herbs 
are safe or effective. Thus, willy-nilly herbal use can be risky. 
</P>
<P>
However, the herbal picture is not all as dark as death. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for comfrey, I'm not concerned about herbs or herbal teas consumed in 
reasonable, ordinary amounts," says Norman Fransworth, a professor in the 
College of Pharmacy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"True herbalism includes scientific testing, honest reporting of the results 
and safe use of effective herbs by informed practitioners," says Varro E. 
Tyler, vice president for academic affairs and professor of pharmacognosy at 
Purdue. Pharmacognosy is the study of drugs derived from natural products. 
</P>
<P>
"Herb use can be a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde situation," says Tyler, who is also 
the author of "The New Honest Herbal" (J. B. Lippincott Co.) He says " 
'Paraherbalism,' a pseudoscience about herb use, is usually characterized by 
popular myths." He lists them as: 
</P>
<P>
* Herbs are "natural" and do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
* Whole herbs are more effective than their isolated active constituents. 
</P>
<P>
* "Natural" and "organic" herbs are superior to synthetic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
* Astrological influences may be significant. (Some practitioners prescribe 
herbs according to astrological signs.) 
</P>
<P>
* Tests in animals are not applicable to human beings. 
</P>
<P>
The American Botanical Council, an herbal educational group in Austin, Tex., is 
promoting a new regulatory classification for herbs, called "traditional 
medicines." 
</P>
<P>
"That category would let us review the safety and efficacy of herbs," says Mark 
Blumenthal, executive director. "Currently, it costs somewhere around $125 
million to get one new drug approved in the United States. And, we do need to 
provide for appropriate labeling of herbs so the proper directions can be 
given. But in the present regulatory climate created by the federal government, 
that's just impossible. Consumers are not getting adequate directions for 
taking herbs although it's clear people really want these products. Eventually, 
we would like to develop an American Botanical Code, which would be a thorough 
and authoritative reference work on herbs." 
</P>
<P>
According to the council, only about 2% of 500 commonly available herbs have 
been subjected to clinical testing. Of the herbs that have been tested, 
feverfew has been used by physicians to treat migraine; gingko leaf extract is 
used for circulatory problems, tinnitus and short-term memory loss; milk 
thistle seed extract is used for liver toxicity conditions, and valerian root 
ingredients became a sedative. About 25% of prescription medications were first 
taken or synthesized from plants, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan J. Huxtable, professor of pharmacology at the University of Arizona, 
suggests the following guidelines for consuming herbs: 
</P>
<P>
* If ill, see a physician, not an herbalist. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not take herbs if you are pregnant, nursing or trying to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not take a large quantity of one preparation or on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
* Use only preparations that list the plants on the package. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not consume anything that contains comfrey.

CURBS ON SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to "Banning Racist Speech Begs the Real Question of 
Curbing Racism" (Opinion, Oct. 14). After living in the United States for the 
past 13 years, I am still considered a minority, because 17 years ago I was 
born in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the country's hatred toward Iran and Iranians, my country has been 
the target for racism for many years. I know how much a racist remark can hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of freedom and the idea of democracy bring immigrants to America. 
Freedom of speech under the First Amendment is considered to be a luxury by 
many immigrants. Now, university campuses are taking away this freedom because 
of the content of what certain groups of people are saying. There is no clause 
in the First Amendment banning a specific form of speech. I do not think bans 
on racist speech will prevent racism. A bigot will not stop being a bigot 
because you stop him from publicly speaking against a certain ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
An alternate solution could be stronger minority support groups, not a ban on 
our freedoms.

INITIATIVES: THE MONSTER THAT THREATENS CALIFORNIA POLITICS; 
</P>
<P>
OUT OF CONTROL, THE PROCESS ITSELF NOW NEEDS TO BE REFORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perversion, no less than providence, has its symmetries. One generation's 
instrument of liberation hardens into the next's oppressive burden. The best 
and most self-less intentions eventually succumb to the transforming subversion 
of avarice and self-interest, perhaps the most ingenious of human qualities. 
</P>
<P>
There is no clearer example of this than the California initiative. 
</P>
<P>
When the Progressive Hiram Johnson first campaigned for its adoption in 1911, 
he argued that only an instrument of direct democracy could free Sacramento 
from the grip of a vicious monopoly, the Southern Pacific Railroad. What was at 
stake, Johnson argued, was the fate of representative government itself. 
</P>
<P>
He was correct. 
</P>
<P>
THREATENING PROCESS: So, too, are those, like UC Berkeley political science 
professor Eugene C. Lee, who now argue that "in 1990, representative government 
is threatened not by a private monopoly, but by the initiative process itself. 
It . . . has produced occasional benefits but at an extravagant cost." Among 
those costs, Lee contends, is an accelerating erosion of executive and 
legislative responsibility that contributes to Sacramento's current gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Lee's colleague, Berkeley law professor Prebble Stolz, another 
longtime analyst of state government, has pointed out that litigation generated 
by initiatives is choking the courts. The state Supreme Court, for example can 
decide only about 140 cases per year and, if current trends persist, most of 
them soon will involve initiatives and death penalty appeals, many of which are 
themselves the result of enacting capital punishment statutes by initiative. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times Poll found that the public has its own strong reservations about 
the initiative business. According to that survey, more than seven in 10 
Californians think the initiative process has "gone out of control"; 84% 
believe that "there are so many initiatives on the ballot with complex issues 
that an average voter cannot make an intelligent choice." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there is wide consensus in all segments of California society that 
something needs to done about the initiative crisis. Whether the will to do 
that can be discovered may depend in large measure on whether a constructive 
way can be found to reform the process: For when it comes to the initiative, it 
seems, almost all arguments are circular. 
</P>
<P>
REFORM PROGRAM: However, several suggestions for reform currently being 
discussed are clearly worth considering: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Initiatives are restricted by law to a single issue. But the Supreme Court 
has taken an expansive view of what that means. As a consequence, omnibus 
initiatives that propose wholesale overhaul of entire areas of state law -- 
like Proposition 115 -- or hellishly complex regulatory schemes -- like "Big 
Green" -- have proliferated. Perhaps a constitutional convention should be 
convened to write a clear, restrictive, enforceable new version of the single 
issue provision. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make initiatives statutory changes rather than constitutional amendments. 
Then allow the Legislature and the governor to amend them after some specified 
period of time. This would provide more flexibility in dealing with the 
proposals' unforeseen consequences. Most states with an initiative procedure 
already do this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a nonpartisan, appointive panel to review initiatives before they 
go on the ballot to evaluate their impact and constitutionality and to make 
non-binding suggestions for improving their language. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then require the panel or the Legislature to hold meaningful, 
well-publicized public hearings on the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adopt strict new guidelines requiring that the true financial sponsors of 
all initiatives be listed on the petitions circulated in the ballot pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion -- simple abolition -- should be rejected outright. The 
initiative remains an indispensable check on legislative misrule. It is worth 
saving, even from its own excess.

CASUALTIES IN PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone is misinformed (or is trying to misinform others) about the number of 
Panamanians killed by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Southern Command, 515 Panamanians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
According to both the Panamanian government and the "independent and respected" 
Panamanian Committee for Human Rights, about 570 Panamanians were killed. 
According to the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the U.S. Invasion of 
Panama, which is reported to have conducted months of on-site investigations 
with civilians, medical personnel, political and union leaders, U.S. military 
leaders, several human rights organizations, religious leaders and others, 
between 1,000 and 4,000 Panamanians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Whom are we to believe? Roberto Troncoso, president of the Panamanian Committee 
for Human Rights, is quoted as stating: "There are no mass graves, no hidden 
cemeteries." Yet the photograph accompanying your article depicts just such a 
mass grave. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 14 mass graves have been documented. In late April and early May, one 
such grave was exhumed at Jardin de Paz in Panama. It contained 124 bodies.

CASUALTIES IN PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many still debate the true number of Panamanians who lost their lives in last 
December's invasion. The exact answer is obvious and irrefutable: too many. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Panama last February and visited a mass grave at the Jardin de Paz 
cemetery where the bodies of hundreds of "liberated" Panamanians were tossed 
into a pit and covered up. A woman mourning her husband told me he was buried 
there somewhere, thrown into the pit "like a dog." Survivors could only guess 
where their loved one lay beneath the 100 by 18 foot rectangle of bare earth. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military and Panama's invasion-installed government admit to more than 
500 killed, but many others say thousands more died. But the question goes 
beyond statistics. The invasion's victims were people whose lives mattered. 
They died in their own homes in an invasion carried out by a foreign power.

A TERRITORIAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NATALIE SALAZAR, NATALIE SALAZAR, executive director of the Lomita-based 
Community Reclamation Project, a gang-prevention program, commented on 
competition among social programs for dwindling funds. She told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles there is a lot of jealousy and infighting among people and 
programs who have good ideas but keep them to themselves. It's a territorial 
issue over who is going to get the best publicity in order to get funding. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, there was a broader funding base for social programs and more 
federal money. Today, there is a lack of money and funding alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is nobody is an expert (on gangs) because the problem keeps 
changing so rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the discouraging things we see now is law enforcement taking 
on the (former) role of community-based programs to divert young men and women 
from gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad they are trying to get involved. (But) we need to use the 
community-based prevention programs already out there; otherwise, funding 
sources may continue to dwindle as public agencies attempt to take over their 
role.

WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY WE MUST FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE BUSH'S RHETORIC HURTLES US TOWARD WAR, HE HAS YET TO GIVE AMERICANS 
ADEQUATE ANSWERS. 
</P>

Washington.

"Either he gets out of Kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by 
force and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences. He has been 
warned. Time is running out for Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Parliament on Nov. 7 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's neo-Churchillian rhetoric is getting a little cloying. While the 
fabled Desert Rats may be fine soldiers, they are outnumbered 100-1 by Iraqis. 
Americans, not Brits, are going to do the dying to validate these 
overdramatized ultimata we keep getting from 10 Downing St. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about the fate of 500,000 Kuwaitis that so tears at the heart of the 
Iron Lady who calmly deeded over to Deng Xiaoping the 7 million betrayed and 
terrified subjects of Her Majesty's Crown Colony of Hong Kong? 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush's rhetoric is hurtling us toward war, he has yet to give 
his countrymen adequate answers to the crucial questions: What vital interest 
of ours is threatened by Iraq's control of Kuwait? Why is Hussein our problem; 
why is this our war? 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was never an ally. And, unlike Syria's Hafez Assad, Hussein never blew 
up an American airliner or Marine barracks. Why, then, is Hussein's "brutal, 
naked aggression" against Kuwait a casus belli for the United States, when his 
"brutal, naked aggression" against Iran was abetted by the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Well, says the Wall Street Journal, "someone has to stop him. If you ask why it 
should be the Americans, the answer is that the Americans are the only ones who 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. Others can, but won't. Iraq is a country of only 17 million, 4 
million of whom are disloyal Kurds. Iran has 50 million; Turkey, 55 million and 
the largest army in NATO; Egypt, 55 million; Syria, 11 million, and a regime as 
brutal as Saddam Hussein's. Israel has atomic weapons. If the takeover of 
Kuwait is not reason enough for them to go to war, why is it our battle to 
fight, halfway around the world? 
</P>
<P>
As each of the old arguments for war is answered, new ones are advanced. We 
must fight, it is now said, to stop Hussein from acquiring atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If deterrence protected us from the ICBMs of Moscow, why should we fear the 
SCUD missiles of Baghdad? 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III found a new pretext: "The 
credibility of the United Nations is at stake. It's very important that when 
the United Nations takes actions -- passes resolutions and takes actions -- 
that those resolutions and actions be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
So, we Americans are to be the Hessians of the new world order. Our Marines are 
to be sent out to fight where the United Nations tells us, to punish those the 
Security Council deems deserving of slaughter. Can the secretary believe the 
American people will buy into this? 
</P>
<P>
All our Arab allies, it is said, want Hussein destroyed. Of course, the Arab 
regimes do, but, what about the Arab people? Will they cheer us? Or, will they 
come to hate and despise us, as they came to hate and despise the Israelis? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, we are moving toward war. The U.S. armored divisions are being brought 
down from Germany. Europeans and Japanese rush to Baghdad to bring their 
hostages out. Vice President Dan Quayle says that it is not enough to get 
Hussein out of Kuwait; we must strip him of his arsenal. Bush, with his "I have 
had it!" rhetoric, paints himself deeper and deeper into a corner, the only 
exit from which may be the open window marked "war." 
</P>
<P>
And, when the war starts, who will be with us to the end? And, where is the 
end? If we destroy Iraq's air force, nuclear plants and chemical weapons, can 
we then go home? Or, must we send in the tanks and drive him out of Kuwait? If 
Hussein's military-Baathist regime is standing after that, must we send the 
Marines up the bloody road to Baghdad, lest a wounded, revanchist, hate-filled 
Iraq wait to strike again? We know how the war begins -- with 2,000 air sorties 
a day. Wholesale destruction. But, how does it end? 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq is smashed, who occupies and rebuilds and defends Kuwait? How do we 
deal with the new power in the Persian Gulf, Iran? What if we learn that 
Tehran, too, is working on atomic weapons? 
</P>
<P>
Instead of looking for a pretext to get his country into war, Baker should be 
searching, hard, for some way to get his President off the hook. For, if 
America attacks, it will not be Hussein's war; it will be Bush's war. It will 
split his party, polarize his country, poison its politics, wiping out what is 
left of our position in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
For what? Does anyone think that, after we have shed all that Arab blood, our 
reward will be true peace in that cauldron of hatred they call the Middle East?

No. 14 Texas (7-1) is in the driver's seat in the SWC race and will likely earn 
the conference's automatic bid to the Cotton Bowl -- probably to face Miami, 
Fla. That would put the Aggies in the Holiday Bowl against the WAC champion, 
which almost certainly will be No. 8 Brigham Young (8-1). 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't spend New Year's Eve in Dallas (at the Cotton Bowl), I don't 
think there's a better place to spend the latter part of December than in San 
Diego," said John David Crow, athletic director at Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
There is an outside chance of Baylor (5-3-1) winning the conference title, but 
Holiday Bowl officials and the schools have made a deal to take either Texas 
A&amp;M or Texas. Should Baylor win the conference title, a source close to the 
Holiday Bowl said the bowl officials would have the option to choose either 
Texas or Texas A&amp;M, and they would most likely pick the winner of the Texas 
A&amp;M-Texas game, Dec. 1 in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl bids cannot be officially extended until Nov. 24, according to the NCAA, 
but because four Pacific 10 Conference schools unofficially committed to games 
last week, bowl officials and teams spent the weekend scurrying to arrange 
holiday dates. 
</P>
<P>
"As an option, we are very intrigued by (the SWC)," said John Reid, executive 
director of the Holiday Bowl. "It would seem to be an exciting move for us, 
bringing a new flavor and a new look to the game. It would broaden our base 
even further. We've had Southwest Conference teams, but never either of these 
two." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Methodist, which lost to BYU in the 1980 Holiday Bowl, and Arkansas, 
which defeated Arizona State in 1985, are the only SWC teams to have played in 
the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M, which lost to Pittsburgh, 31-28, in last year's John Hancock 
Bowl, was a preseason pick to win the SWC because of its offensive backfield 
and linebackers. Tailback Darren Lewis (149 yards a game) is second in the 
nation in rushing, but the Aggies were upset, 17-8, earlier this season at 
Louisiana State and they lost to Houston, 36-31. They tied Baylor, 20-20, 
leaving them with slim hopes for the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Although Texas A&amp;M has never played in a Holiday Bowl, Crow and Coach R.C. 
Slocum are familiar with the city of San Diego. Crow was offensive coordinator 
of the Chargers under Tommy Prothro in 1974-75, and Slocum visited with Holiday 
Bowl executives in San Diego last summer during a hospitality function for 
various coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Still, like Crow, Slocum hasn't given up on the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're in a conference situation, you'd like to win the conference 
championship," Slocum said. "If we can't, the Holiday Bowl is very attractive. 
We've had contact with them over the last several years and we have a high 
impression of the people and the Holiday Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The only way Texas A&amp;M (3-1-1 in the SWC) can win the conference 
championship is if the Aggies defeat their final three opponents -- Arkansas, 
Texas Christian and Texas, and Texas loses at Texas Christian on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Texas (5-0) can lose the conference championship is if the 
Longhorns lose two of their final three, against TCU, Baylor and Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be flattered if (the Holiday Bowl) would ask us," said DeLoss Dodds, 
Texas athletic director. ". . . We plan to go to the Cotton Bowl, but we have 
three hard ones left." 
</P>
<P>
For Baylor (4-1-1) to win the SWC championship, the Bears must win their final 
two games -- against Rice and Texas -- and hope somebody else beats Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the choice for the Holiday Bowl would come down to the winner of 
the Texas A&amp;M-Texas game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think either one of those teams would be very attractive," said Vinnie 
Vinson, chairman of the Holiday Bowl's team selection committee. "The worst 
(that probably would) happen is that A&amp;M would come in here 8-3-1 or Texas 
would be 9-2."

AL UNSER JR. NEVER GETS INTO RACE

<P>
Everything was going according to plan for the Chevrolet Spice team Sunday. The 
Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego was about 30 minutes old and a yellow 
flag came out. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect, thought Chris Pook, president of Del Mar Race Management, which paid 
Al Unser Jr. to race at the fairgrounds for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect, thought Unser, who immediately put on his helmet and readied to switch 
positions with teammate John (Jay) Cochran, whose contract provided that he 
begin the race. 
</P>
<P>
All Cochran needed to do was reach the pit area and get out of the car. He 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevy that Unser was getting ready to board crashed alongside Turn 5, where 
Ruggero Melgrati, driving a Ferrari Alba, ran Cochran into the wall after 26 
minutes of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Unser shrugged when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just awfully sorry for the Spice team and for Jay," Unser said. "From what 
Jay said . . . there was nothing he could do. He was running conservatively and 
consistently." 
</P>
<P>
Cochran, who has never won a GT Prototype race, had a six-second lead when it 
happened. He knew the crowd of 37,000 came to watch Unser, not him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for Chris Pook and Al," Cochran said. "The car was brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully everyone will see what happened and that it wasn't my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Cochran was on the inside of Melgrati, who turned left on the chicane and left 
Cochran without any options. Melgrati finished fifth in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably tried to pass me on the left; it's neither one of our faults," 
Melgrati said. "I'm just a Camel Lights driver and he's a GTP driver, so he's 
right and I'm wrong."

DEFENSE GETS POINT ON GOAL-LINE STAND

<P>
Nobody was open. John Elway rolled to his right. This can be a nightmare for 
the men who make a living rushing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Elway on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Look out. 
</P>
<P>
It was late in the third quarter Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. A few 
minutes earlier, cornerback Kevin Clark had romped 75 yards on a kickoff return 
to put the Denver Broncos 24 yards from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Third and seven from the 10. The Broncos were down by five. As Elway neared the 
sideline, Charger defensive end Burt Grossman closed in. Last chance. Elway 
threw a pass across the field in the direction of receiver Michael Young. 
Grossman smashed him into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In the end zone was cornerback Gill Byrd. Later he would say that he knew he 
could get there and intercept this pass. But he had two fears. Would a Bronco 
step across and grab it before him? Or might he drop it? 
</P>
<P>
No. And no. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd hung on for his second interception of the game. And the Chargers hung on, 
too. Grossman, Byrd and the rest of the defense sent Elway to the sideline 
without even the consolation of a field goal. On the ensuing possession, the 
Chargers went 80 yards for a touchdown to sprinkle a little insurance on what 
was soon to become a 19-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
This is called finishing the job. Remember how many times last season this same 
defense played well for three quarters and a handful of minutes? Then there was 
the big drive. Then the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. Elway and the Broncos, who have made three Super Bowl 
appearances in four years, were sent home with a 3-6 record. And when Billy Joe 
Tolliver knelt on the turf to erase the final ticks of the clock, nothing 
looked bigger than that third-quarter defensive stand that left Elway shaking 
his head and doing a lot of explaining in locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dumb play," Elway said. "I was trying to make something happen. Going 
onto the field I said, 'We've got to get it in the end zone.' I made a stupid 
play trying to get it there." 
</P>
<P>
Even a guy with Elway's exceptional arm has to think twice about throwing that 
type of pass with Byrd roaming nearby. Byrd is the Chargers' all-time 
interception leader with 32. So this was like letting the cat baby-sit the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
"To roll right and throw left is a dangerous, dangerous thing," Charger Coach 
Dan Henning said. "(Elway) has made a lot of plays like that and probably 
gotten away with some, but I think he would like to have that one back." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't work that way, however. There are professions in which you can 
change you mind a minute, an hour, a day later and still be OK. Professional 
football is not one of them, however. You choose, and soon you know it was 
either a very good choice or a very bad one. 
</P>
<P>
This was bad and good. Bad for Elway. Good for the Chargers (5-5). 
</P>
<P>
Byrd had his own decision to make on this play. With the ball firmly in hand, 
he thought he might take a shot at the 100-yard dash toward the other end zone. 
Then the voice of his coach ran through his head. 
</P>
<P>
You see, there was a similar situation in practice Friday. Cornerback Donald 
Frank intercepted a pass and knelt in the end zone. Byrd came over and told him 
he should have run with the ball. Henning corrected him. 
</P>
<P>
"So when I intercepted, I thought about taking it out," Byrd said. "And then I 
heard the voice from Friday: 'No, don't do it.' So I said, 'OK, let's just sit 
down.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is a play that undoubtedly will be lost in the shuffle of more spectacular 
Charger highlights. It wasn't Gary Anderson hurdling high over two defenders 
and landing in the end zone. It was a zone matchup defense that defensive 
coordinator Ron Lynn says is a little too complex to explain. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the heck you get paid for," Lynn said. "That's the greatest 
position to be put in. You can look at it as half-full or half-empty. On one 
hand, you say 'Oh my God, they've only got (24) yards to go.' On the other 
hand, if you go in and you defend it and don't give up any points everybody 
says, 'That's great defense.' "

PLUMMER COULD HAVE BEEN MVP TWICE

<P>
John Riggins holds the NFL all-time record for most touchdowns in a season with 
24. 
</P>
<P>
If teammates cooperated, linebacker Gary Plummer might be in position to 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer scored the club's only touchdown Sunday, and would have had an 
additional touchdown had quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver been on target. 
</P>
<P>
"I just missed him," Tolliver said. "The way I see it, if Plummer would have 
caught that ball . . . we knew he was going to score later in the game. . . . 
It would have been pretty frustrating for the offensive guys if Plummer had 
come in here as both offensive and defensive MVP." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver kept a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been tough on the guys," he said, "and may have been a blow we 
could not overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer scored on a one-yard dive in the fourth quarter after unsuccessfully 
lunging for Tolliver's pass in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was high and outside. Definitely a ball," Plummer said. "He threw a heater, 
but maybe a slowball to a guy like me might be better." 
</P>
<P>
Despite eyewitness accounts, Tolliver pleaded innocent to reports that he threw 
a football into the stands after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't me. It wasn't me," he said. "As my boy Jim McMahon always told me, 
when they blame it on you, say, 'It wasn't me.' And stick with it even if 
you're cold busted. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I can say: It wasn't me. I can't afford the $500 (fine)." 
</P>
<P>
Hello. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chargers' first offensive play of the game, Denver linebacker Simon 
Fletcher raced in untouched on Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver managed to pass the ball to Ronnie Harmon for a five-yard gain, but 
after releasing the ball, Fletcher drilled Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that was only Tolliver's helmet rolling on the ground, and not his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Tolliver explained his role in the Chargers' attack, leading to 
speculation he may have been hit in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a band leader," he said. "I don't have to play any instruments. I 
just have to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
The streak lives on. Tolliver has now thrown 121 passes without an 
interception. It's the second-longest streak in team history. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fouts holds the mark with 168 passes in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman was running forward, and quarterback John Elway was 
running backward and sideways, and still he could not catch the sore-toed 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to wait for (Indianapolis' 40-year-old quarterback Joe) 
Ferguson," Grossman said. "That's about the only one I can get, I think." 
</P>
<P>
In a straight-ahead match race, however, the heavy money would have to go on 
Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning told the Charger Backers Friday, "You can't believe 
everything you read." 
</P>
<P>
Now we understand what he was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the Chargers' injury report, it hasn't been all that reliable 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Rod Bernstine never appeared on the team's injury report last 
week, but he didn't even put on a uniform for Sunday's game. Bernstine told 
reporters Thursday and Friday that he would be ready to play, although he had a 
hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to play," Bernstine said, "but my hamstring was real 
sore this morning when I came here." 
</P>
<P>
The club had put defensive end Burt Grossman's name on the injury report, and 
had listed him as questionable with a fingernail injury. Grossman, however, 
explained that it was a joke. But the club never informed Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the Chargers did not put starting tackle Broderick Thompson on 
the injury report, although he failed to practice because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Tolliver tried to go deep to wide receiver Anthony 
Miller, but Miller's pass route was cut short on a downfield check by Denver 
safety Steve Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver ran more than 30 yards to the end zone to argue with the official. 
It's the fastest anyone has seen Tolliver run since July when players got word 
they were serving pizza in the training camp dining room. 
</P>
<P>
After having a chance to review videotape of the game Sunday night, Henning 
agreed with Tolliver. "He definitely held up Miller," he said. 
</P>
<P>
You mention, "Ghosts," to Denver linebacker Michael Brooks and he thinks you're 
talking about Derrick Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Walker caught a 22-yard pass from Tolliver in the first quarter, and, poof, he 
was gone by Brooks, who fell for a Walker fake and grabbed nothing but air on 
his way to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
There was a good reason why half the field was shielded by shade -- nose tackle 
Joe Phillips was back on the Chargers' sideline. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-5, 295-pound Phillips, who brings to mind the Rocky Mountains when you 
see him in person, has been recovering from a beating he took outside a Mission 
Bay restaurant in the early morning hours of Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is not expected to return to play until next season, but tell that to 
Chargers' defensive back Donnie Elder. Elder was shoved out of bounds while 
trying to run down field to cover a punt and rolled into Phillips. It may have 
been the hardest hit Elder took all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to have played," Phillips said. "It's harder to stand on 
the sideline and watch than to stay at home because you're close to the action. 
You want to jump right in and go make a tackle." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Donald Frank was beaten badly on John Elway's 22-yard 
touchdown pass to Vance Johnson in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Johnson was Donnie Elder's responsibility.

ELWAY SAYS BRONCOS NOT ON THE BALL THIS SEASON 
</P>

<P>
John Elway, the quarterback with the great arm and the bum foot, stood by his 
dressing chamber with his head down. 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Soon he would have to talk about yet another Bronco loss to the man with the 
microphone standing in front of the television camera. 
</P>
<P>
Elway has guided the Broncos to three Super Bowls. He has lost all three. This 
season, further evidenced by the Broncos' 19-7 loss to the Chargers Sunday at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, he won't likely get a chance to win his first or 
lose his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? "We're stopping ourselves too much," Elway said. "We just 
made too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Two of which were his. He was intercepted twice by cornerback Gill Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't throw the ball well on the move today," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
Elway finished 17 of 30 for 171 yards and a touchdown. On the Broncos' final 
offensive play, his pass intended for Vance Johnson fell incomplete. Then the 
Chargers took over and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
There was much ado about his toe and foot injury. It slowed him somewhat, but, 
as Byrd pointed out: "John being a little nicked up is still more mobile than 
most quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Broncos are flat coming off last year's Super Bowl loss to the 
49ers, Elway said: "No, I don't think we have a Super Bowl hangover this year. 
But in '88 we did. We need to make some plays, and get some confidence. We're 
going to take it one game at a time until they say we're mathematically out of 
it. We still have a chance." DON PATTERSON

'DEFENSE': CHECK YOUR MATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the art of seduction, never underestimate the power of talk, observes one of 
the characters in "Alekhine's Defense," at South Coast Repertory's Second 
Stage. Words can be more persuasive than caresses. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Daseler's play proves the point. It's words, words, words, with only a 
few strategically placed caresses, yet it generates considerable erotic 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic triangle here consists of two co-workers (Julie Fulton and Robert 
Sicular), fellow bureaucrats in a county schools office, and the woman's 
husband (Don Took), a research librarian. These are the sort of people whose 
romantic entanglements seldom get much attention on stage or screen -- unless 
it's for the sake of a lampoon. But Daseler treats their wayward hearts with 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
At least he does so for two-thirds of his triangle. We understand why June is 
attracted to her colleague Alan and vice versa. What we don't understand is why 
she's married to Hal. 
</P>
<P>
Hal doesn't appear until the end of the first act, by which time Alan has taken 
advantage of a massive head start in terms of winning over the audience as well 
as June. After work one Friday, June has invited him to her suburban Southland 
tract house for dinner, and they're having drinks on the patio while waiting 
for Hal to join them. Alan makes his moves -- mostly verbal -- on June. June 
lightly resists in order to make a few moves of her own on Alan. 
</P>
<P>
In case you hadn't noticed, the metaphor here is from chess; Alexander Alekhine 
was a grandmaster from early in the century whose "Defense" was "an 
asymmetrical response to standard openings which has substantial surprise 
value," to quote the program notes of dramaturge Jerry Patch. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor itself doesn't have much surprise value, in the wake of "Chess," 
the musical. But in contrast with "Chess," it's used here with a degree of 
subtlety befitting the game. 
</P>
<P>
During the first act, no one mentions chess, but we do notice that Alan and 
June pursue each other around the big squares that appear in the cement of the 
patio. And Alan's parrying, in particular, has an asymmetrical quality that 
initially catches June by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
She has learned how to respond by the end of that first act, however, and her 
citing her marriage to Hal as a rebuff to Alan appears to have something behind 
it, despite her obvious attraction to Alan. When Hal arrives, we look forward 
to a tough, evenly matched game in the second act. 
</P>
<P>
Hal and Alan actually play chess in the second half, and Hal purports to teach 
Alan about Alekhine's Defense, in the course of winning the game. But in the 
battle for June, Hal isn't much of a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
He's so aggressively sour and cynical, and condescending to June, who is 15 
years his junior, that it's hard to understand how the two ever got together. 
By this time, we have heard detailed accounts of June and Alan's previous 
marriages, but we hear virtually nothing about how the most important marriage 
in the play, Hal and June's, began. 
</P>
<P>
Hal's choleric wisecracks elicit the play's biggest laughs, but we're laughing 
at him more than with him. As played by Took and tweedily costumed by Sylvia 
Vega-Vasquez, Hal doesn't figure strongly in the romance of the play, and the 
second act isn't the harrowing and scintillating battle of wits and affections 
that one might expect. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as directed by Eli Simon, the sparks between Fulton's June and Sicular's 
Alan keep flickering throughout the evening. With her unassuming yet 
deceptively steely air, Fulton smartly embodies the Southern California woman, 
out to remake her identity yet again (at 31, June is already on her third 
marriage). Alan too is ready for a new beginning, and Sicular's voice and eyes 
are seductive enough to get Alan what he wants, if not to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
Daseler's dialogue takes plenty of lively little excursions that are more 
pertinent than they appear at first. It's refreshing to hear this kind of talk 
from Southern California suburbanites, so often maligned as inarticulate or 
mindless, and Peter Maradudin's lighting of Cliff Faulkner's patio makes one 
wonder why more suburbanites don't while away their evenings in the fading 
light, playing romantic games with each other and imagining the future.

Myths in the Making: Martial-arts movie star Steven Seagal seems to have 
trouble separating myth from reality. He recently appeared on Arsenio Hall's 
talk show and said that he spent a lot of his youth in Brooklyn, but his 
mother, Pat, told People magazine that he was born in Lansing, Mich., and lived 
outside Detroit before moving to Fullerton, Calif., when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Seagal also has portrayed himself as an urban street kid, but his mother says 
he suffered from asthma and was "a puny kid back then." The People story also 
casts doubt on Seagal's claim to have studied in Japan with Morihei Uyeshiba, 
the founder of the aikido form of martial arts, who died in 1969. Sources 
familiar with the CIA also say Seagal's claim to have been a CIA adviser is 
improbable. CLAUDIA PUIG

Britain Gives the Nod to Arts: The British government, recently blasted by arts 
organizations for not showing enough commitment to the arts, has announced an 
11% increase in government support for the arts in 1991, as well as the 
establishment of a new arts fund. Arts Minister David Mellor said Friday that 
the government would give the British Arts Council $379 million next year, an 
increase of $37 million over this year. CLAUDIA PUIG

Canadian Punkers Not Obscene: A Canadian jury has found two records by the punk 
rock group DayGlo Abortions not obscene. The jury ruled Thursday that the 
albums, "Feed Us a Fetus" and "Here Today Guano Tomorrow" -- which are laced 
with four-letter words and describe sex, satanism, bestiality, rape, murder and 
suicide -- are not obscene as charged under Canada's criminal code. Band 
members, with names such as Cretin, Couch Potato and Jesus Bonehead, contend 
that the songs are parodies intended to shock. CLAUDIA PUIG

One Small Step: Astronauts, given a crash course in filmmaking, shot 
spectacular footage from outer space of live volcanoes, burning rain forests 
and severely eroded coastlines for "Blue Planet," a new film about the Earth. 
Crews from seven different U.S. space missions worked on the movie, made by 
Imax Systems of Toronto, which will be shown on giant screens in museums and 
planetariums around the world. Complementing the footage from outer space, a 
two-minute computer-simulated sequence makes viewers feel they are taking a 
high-speed flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco along the San Andreas 
fault. CLAUDIA PUIG

SOPRANO MIRELLA FRENI IN EXEMPLARY RECITAL AT THE AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In wonderful voice, and gracious to a fault, Mirella Freni returned to 
Ambassador Auditorium after a seven-year absence Saturday night and gave 
thrills to a sold-out audience in the 1,200-seat hall. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran Italian soprano did nothing unexpected in this belated return. 
</P>
<P>
Her program was half Italian and half Russian, and the combination seemed to 
please her adoring fans, who gave her an extended round of applause before she 
sang a note, and several lengthy ovations later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
This agenda -- from Gluck and Mozart through Rossini, Boito and Verdi, and 
ending with Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky -- had cogency and variety in its 
favor, and did not seem to tax the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Decades of stardom, no doubt, have made Freni a relaxed performer. On this 
occasion, she did not work hard, or seem to strain. Her singing remains 
beautifully focused, untroubled. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of her longevity may be that very relaxation: In most of this 
exemplary performance, the soprano showed little involvement with the material 
at hand. She tended to little details -- not always textual details, but never 
mind -- and to the longer line, and let the music shape itself, which it often 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
But she projected little of herself along with the handsome tone she usually 
produces. And she seems to know that, in giving less than total dedication to 
the recitalist's task, she is still giving enough to make an audience happy. 
</P>
<P>
There were good reasons to be happy here. Well-wrought, if not exactly pointed, 
performances of "O del mio dolce ardor" and of Susanna's aria from "Nozze di 
Figaro," began the proceedings. Four Rachmaninoff songs and the letter scene 
from "Evgeny Onegin" closed it. 
</P>
<P>
In between were non-operatic songs by Rossini and Verdi and "L'altra notte," 
from "Mefistofele." A few flat, or strident, or inconsistent moments aside, all 
were carefully sung. 
</P>
<P>
After the Tchaikovsky aria, Freni took two of the same encores she had given in 
1983, "Io son l'umile ancella" from "Adriana Lecouvreur" and "O mio babbino 
caro," from "Gianni Schicchi." 
</P>
<P>
As she had on that earlier occasion, pianist Paola Molinari provided always 
competent, usually faceless accompaniments.

RESPONDING TO AUTHOR'S DEFENSE OF CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the Counterpunch article by Bradley Steffens ("A Once-Banned 
Author Believes in Censorship for the Good of Society," Oct. 29), I would like 
to say that I am fed up with the notion that every American must live in a 
society that allows no artistic expression beyond that suitable for a 
12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, all you well-meaning but sadly misguided parents, but I never asked 
you to have children. 
</P>
<P>
You chose to, and it's your responsibility to raise them with whatever morals 
you see fit; but please stop expecting other adults to sacrifice their 
intelligence on the altar of your children. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to enjoy "adult themes." I enjoy them in the literature I read, in the 
movies I watch, in the art I view and in the music I listen to. Thematically, 
my life is of an adult nature, and to keep out of "Disneyland" I will do 
everything in my power to sustain whatever rights I have. 
</P>
<P>
I resent the paternalistic attitude that does nothing more than socially retard 
the entire culture and promote yet another generation of the ignorant who 
giggle and leer at the human body and consider words commonly used by our 
Anglo-Saxon ancestors as "dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me, Mom and Dad of America, but I think if you spent half the effort 
teaching your children kindness and selflessness that you spent keeping them 
away from sex, you might raise a generation of truly decent human beings.

Let me get this straight -- a writer singing the praises of censorship? 
</P>
<P>
As distasteful as an attitude such as his might be, I can at least understand 
it when it's being stumped by pandering politicians or self-promoting district 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
But to what office does Steffens aspire? Poet laureate for a right-minded 
government? Moral Majority toady? 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the (2 Live Crew) jurors were acting to protect the adults of their 
community," he writes, "they were not out of line." So the jury was not out of 
line, but the advocates of the First Amendment apparently are. He derisively 
calls First Amendment advocates "self-appointed protectors" who believe they 
are the only thing between us and the loss of our freedom. Come again? 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, what does Steffens call people who tell you that you cannot 
hear or read something because they have decided it is bad for you? I used to 
call these people Mommy and Daddy, but then I grew up. Steffens calls them the 
government and would have us all do the same.

LUTHER CAMPBELL'S LYRICS

<P>
Luther Campbell self-righteously puts an "adult" sticker on the album and hides 
behind his claim of comedy ("Today They're Trying to Censor Rap, Tomorrow. . . 
," Nov. 5). 
</P>
<P>
Since when is it entertainment to tear open women's vaginas, bust the walls, 
break their backbones? 
</P>
<P>
They call this comedy? I call it rape, and rape and sexual violence aren't 
funny. Ask the runner in Central Park.

<P>
In the final paragraphs of his article, Steffens ridicules the notion that 
there is a force in society poised to wrest our freedom of expression from us. 
He asserts that the American people can be trusted to defend our freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of this argument is that it leads to the conclusion that the Bill of 
Rights is superfluous because "we are a good people, a fair people." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the philosophical thought and the historical necessity that gave rise 
to the Bill of Rights. The guarantees of freedom of expression (press, 
religion, assembly) in the Constitution expressly prohibit the majority from 
denying these rights of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
If we can rely on legislators to protect our freedoms of the press and of 
speech, why does the Bill of Rights begin with the words, "Congress shall make 
no law abridging. . . ."? Our founding fathers knew what Steffens has forgotten 
about -- demagoguery and mob rule. 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew may not be Steffens' (or my) idea of what the founding fathers had 
in mind. I think that "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" is constitutionally protected 
speech. Steffens may disagree. But clearly the framers of the Constitution 
didn't leave the question of censorship up to us, or to politicians, or to the 
wisdom of the majority.

<P>
LAGUNA CANYON: OPPOSING PARTIES SHED BITTER FEELINGS OF LONG BATTLE TO TOAST 
THE PRESERVATION AGREEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
The private celebration at the posh Center Club in Costa Mesa a week before 
last Tuesday's election demonstrated how far they had come. 
</P>
<P>
After dining on exotic foods and toasting the historic agreement to preserve 
Laguna Canyon -- one of the last undeveloped coastal canyons in Southern 
California -- the motley group of environmentalists, government officials and 
Irvine Co. executives were entertained by company Vice President Carol Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
She shed her conservative corporate image to perform a rap song -- a satire 
that included a spoof of Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren. 
</P>
<P>
"Save the canyon, buy the canyon, save the canyon, buy," she said rhythmically. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxed atmosphere that evening was in stark contrast to the bitter 
feelings of a year ago today when environmentalists and city officials led 
almost 8,000 people in a march through the canyon to protest the company's 
plans for a residential and commercial complex on the pristine countryside. 
</P>
<P>
But after approaching each other at the negotiating table earlier this year 
with caution and trepidation, the bargainers at the table grew to respect each 
other. So eager were they to strike a deal as talks reached fever pitch in 
September that they were admonished at one point by those they represented not 
to give in so easily. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was a plan that made most everyone happy and won overwhelming 
approval by the voters in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
There was not much hope of such a satisfying deal at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The battle to "save the canyon" had dragged on for more than 10 years and 
citizens had failed to persuade the Orange County Board of Supervisors to 
reject the development. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling frustrated, Lida Lenney, a Laguna Beach City Council member,wrote a 
letter to Bren three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cannot give it to us, help us buy it," she remembered asking. 
</P>
<P>
As she waited for a response to her request for a meeting with the usually 
inaccessible Bren, Lenney launched the Laguna Canyon Conservancy to fight for 
preservation of the canyon. A few months later, that group joined Laguna 
Greenbelt Inc. in a lawsuit challenging the development agreement between the 
county and the company. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney, now the Laguna Beach mayor, said Hoffman and other corporate executives 
scoffed at her idea to buy the land, and so did her colleagues on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"People would say Lida was nuts. This was never going to work," City Councilman 
Dan Kenney said recently. 
</P>
<P>
But soon after picketing Bren's Newport Beach neighborhood last year, Lenney 
said, she received word that Bren would meet with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare, she called her brother, Ralph Nichols, a self-made millionaire in 
Detroit. His advice was, "Remember that every dollar is as important to him as 
it is to you." 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Bren did not agree to give up the land, but at least a 
relationship had been established, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over those early days of talks between the city and the company, 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry said both sides were learning that they had to be 
willing to change their minds about each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure he (Bren) must have had some crazy thoughts walking into that room 
and knowing he had to meet with Bob Gentry, environmentalist, gay man, advocate 
for all the things he probably doesn't stand for." 
</P>
<P>
"I had felt the same way about him and (Senior Vice President) Gary Hunt. I had 
never met Gary Hunt before, this slick lawyer who is a hatchet man for the 
county's wealthiest man," he said laughingly. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the politically influential company already had in hand the 
development agreement and was not interested in selling the 2,150-acre site -- 
part of which would be used for the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor toll 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a very good project, and we felt very comfortable with it," 
Hunt said of the 3,200-unit Laguna Laurel project, which would have left 
one-third of the site as open space. 
</P>
<P>
But then came the event that environmentalists believe was what forced Bren to 
take them seriously -- the walk through the canyon that showed how deeply 
citizens felt about this natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struck with that -- the number of people who turned out," Bren said in 
an interview last month. "I believe the number and the sincerity of the people 
impressed me, and we moved forward with our discussions and our negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Proposals were made and rejected during the next few months, and the Laguna 
Laurel Advisory group -- representing environmental groups, the county, city, 
and the Irvine Co. -- was created to find areas of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. declared a November deadline to "buy it or build it," so the 
committee last summer commissioned a public opinion poll to determine whether 
Orange County voters would be willing to tax themselves to buy Laguna Canyon 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Although the poll indicated less than the two-thirds support needed for the 
bond's passage, it did convince officials that a solid 55% majority supported 
preservation of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the city and environmentalists watched county officials warm 
up to the idea of donating money to land acquisition. Since then, the county 
has tentatively approved a $10-million contribution -- a key element of the 
final $78-million financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up survey showed an even greater margin of support in Laguna Beach, 
leading the City Council to schedule the $20-million bond election for November 
without knowing what the final purchase price would be. 
</P>
<P>
Not until late September, when the committee received a land appraisal setting 
the fair market value of the land at $105 million -- did the intense bargaining 
sessions begin. 
</P>
<P>
Those final three weeks of talks were difficult for the committee, which had to 
balance what was a fair asking price for the company against what the city 
could afford. The deal would also have to satisfy the citizens at the table who 
wanted assurances that the most environmentally sensitive land would be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, negotiating team members recalled recently, was the obvious 
pressure the Irvine Co. representatives were feeling from the "Attila the 
builders" within the company who were opposed to the idea of negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
The company's first formal offer was $90 million, plus an agreement to pick up 
the $30.2 million in transportation and sewer improvement costs that the county 
would still require under the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by the proposal, tears filled Lenney's eyes. The city had hoped to pay 
only $50 million to $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot in the course of these negotiations," Lenney said recently 
about her emotional outburst, which made some of her negotiating partners 
uncomfortable. "I have had to give on things I previously would not have given 
in to." 
</P>
<P>
Acting as go-between in the negotiations was Paul Freeman, a former legislative 
aide to one-time Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart and a sometime 
lobbyist and public relations consultant. He was hired by the committee to work 
on the polling and manage the bond campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul was the absolute, indispensable leak through which information would 
flow," Laguna Greenbelt President Elisabeth Brown said. Hunt called Freeman's 
role "Kissinger-esque style shuttle diplomacy." Others said he was equally 
distrusted by all parties, making him an essential tool. 
</P>
<P>
But time was running out for Freeman. He wanted an agreement before an Oct. 9 
fund-raiser for the bond campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days before the event, he flew to Arizona to meet with Irvine Co. officials 
and then caucused with environmentalists in Brown's living room the next 
evening to work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, a tentative agreement was reached by the negotiating committee 
-- or so everyone except the City Council believed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gentry had expressed a couple of reservations before leaving that 
session, Lenney endorsed the "agreement in principle" and so did the 
environmentalists. Freeman and Hunt announced to the news media the details of 
the tentative pact. 
</P>
<P>
But in a council executive session immediately after the committee meeting, 
council members who had not participated in the talks questioned the deal -- 
including the proposed $78-million purchase -- and the authority of the 
advisory group to be making the decisions on a financing plan that would 
ultimately be the city's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
This response almost killed any hopes of compromise. The council circumvented 
the advisory group and ordered City Manager Kenneth C. Frank to ask the Irvine 
Co. for more concessions, including a $3-million reduction in the purchase 
price. 
</P>
<P>
While the council considers Frank the best, toughest negotiator on their side, 
his "take it or leave it" approach on routine city matters has made him a 
controversial figure, and particularly among environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s Hunt and Hoffman heard Frank's proposal but refused to 
negotiate with him. They asked for a private session with the entire council, 
but when that was overruled because it would have violated open meetings law, 
Gentry asked to take over. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut told me -- it was just gut -- that Carol (Hoffman) and Gary (Hunt) 
probably had more trust around me than they did about the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Between Oct. 5 and 7, when the final agreement was reached, Gentry 
met with Hunt and Hoffman and then convinced his side that this was the best 
deal the city and environmentalists would be able to get. Hunt, meanwhile, 
drove to Los Angeles to update Bren. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the company give in on its earlier commitment not to sell below fair 
market value? 
</P>
<P>
"Donald (Bren) felt that this was one of those issues and this was one of those 
times that the company really needed to make the extra effort, to go the extra 
mile to find a way where the community and the company had won," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
There was also, Freeman said, an acknowledgment of "what the political 
consequences would be if they did not have the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist Norm Grossman, considered by many to be a key player at the 
negotiating table, said that while the company is known for wanting to work 
issues out with the communities where it does business, it also wants a good 
public relations image. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a project that little old ladies would lie down in front of 
bulldozers for, and they knew it," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the spirit of goodwill may be tested as a new round of talks begins soon 
over the proposed toll road. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said the board's upcoming vote on the county's 
$10-million contribution will be conditioned on the city's promise not to sue 
the county to block the toll-road project. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney has signaled that she is not ready to give up that fight, although 
others may be willing to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbelt President Brown said the issue will be discussed by her board this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll find out Tuesday how sanguine they are and what are they willing to do."

SCHOOL USES TOUCH TONE TO REACH OUT TO PARENTS;

EDUCATION: HOMEWORK INFORMATION FOR CLASSES AT LOS NARANJOS ELEMENTARY OF 
IRVINE IS BUT A PHONE CALL AWAY.

Parents and pupils at an Irvine school have heard the future of homework and it 
sounds like this: 
</P>
<P>
Ring. Click. "Hellooo! Thank you for calling Los Naranjos School Parent 
Information Hotline. . . . Please enter your two-digit class number to receive 
information from your child's teacher at any time during this message." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the contemporary rat race, in which the rats often seem to be winning, 
computerized voice mail is the latest effort to help harried parents and 
teachers connect -- a move seen by many as crucial to improving student 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 40 schools in a dozen states are experimenting with 24-hour-a-day 
call-in systems. Irvine's homework hot line, installed four weeks ago, is the 
first in California. 
</P>
<P>
Already, it is a success, said Bruce Baron, principal of Los Naranjos 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
"With 480 students at the school, we were getting 400 to 420 calls a night," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By calling the hot line on a touch-tone telephone and punching in a designated 
teacher code, callers hear messages such as this from kindergarten teacher Jane 
Holm: 
</P>
<P>
"We had a fun Halloween day today. We made and ate pumpkin cookies. Ask your 
child what is round and orange. Then ask what is round and orange and has a 
face. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Also sort their Halloween candy by type and size and shape." 
</P>
<P>
And from fifth-grade teacher Dinah Osborne: 
</P>
<P>
"For the spelling contract that's due tomorrow, parents give a pre-test 
tonight. Please check over spelling sentences. In reading, we're finding out 
how a Chinese man is going to be innovative, even though he's blind. Tonight 
they will read the scenes." 
</P>
<P>
By pressing other numbers on the menu, parents can hear a monthly calendar 
update, PTA information, school site council information and a monthly 
principal's message. The system can be programmed to dial parents' homes with 
emergency messages about unscheduled school closings or late buses. 
</P>
<P>
It does not allow parents to leave their own messages for the teacher. "We've 
got a secretary to take messages," which discourages crank callers, Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 system, a product of Nashville-based Advanced Voice Technologies, 
was underwritten by Pacific Telesis and Wells Fargo foundations as part of a 
school restructuring project. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the methods Baron has tried to reach parents, including newsletters and 
night parent education meetings, "none sets up the same dynamics that this 
can," he said. "This is parents as teachers, a real powerful concept." 
</P>
<P>
Baron, a longtime advocate of parent involvement and co-author of "What Did You 
Learn in School Today?" has programmed the system primarily for homework 
messages and what parents can do to help. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have a greater influence on their child's success in school than any 
other factor. Even if they gave a child 15 minutes of undivided attention a 
day, it's more than any child's going to get in school." 
</P>
<P>
He believes information learned in school lodges in "long-term memory" during 
the process of summarizing and retelling. "We expect our kids to retain an 
incredible amount from school. If we don't give them the opportunity to retell 
that, then it's difficult to expect them to retain it in their long-term 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
The voice-mail system also reduces evening stress on both parents and children 
about what the homework assignment actually was. "This completely eliminates 
the nightly game of 'To Tell the Truth, or Did You Remember?' " Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the homework hot line, Dennis Corbett said he and his wife had to guess 
what their children, Jim, 7, and Steve, 5, had been assigned for homework. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they'd tell us, sometimes they wouldn't," he said. "It got to the 
point where it was fun to make mom and dad not know. I'd say, 'So, Jimmy. . . . 
' and he'd say, 'I forgot' even before I'd ask him." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Corbett said, the family gathers around a speaker phone almost every day 
to hear what the teacher has to say. Once when they forgot to call, Jim 
"actually kind of sulked for a day." 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Lewis said her husband, Joe, who works in Chicago, calls the hot line 
once a week to keep informed about what his daughter Casey, 5, and son Garrett, 
7, who is disabled and mainstreamed, are learning in class. "When he talks to 
the kids, he can say, 'oh, did you do this in school?"' 
</P>
<P>
Another parent, Yoko Fujita, said the school program prompted her to switch 
from a dial to a touch-tone phone. 
</P>
<P>
Research has not yet proven a link between giving homework information to 
parents and improved test scores of their children, which many consider the 
bottom line, said Jerold Bauch, an education professor at Vanderbilt University 
who has been researching electronic communications between the two groups for 
three years, starting with answering machines. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to isolate the effect of this particular innovation on something as 
global as student achievement scores in the short term is unlikely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said teachers have reported that homework completion rates, and 
grades based on those rates, "go way up." 
</P>
<P>
Without the system, teachers typically reach only two or three parents a day, 
Bauch said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the schools experimenting with such technology, anywhere from a third to 
half the parents call in daily to retrieve the messages, he said. In one 
Nashville school, he said, the most frequent callers were low-income parents 
who had not been involved in other school activities before. 
</P>
<P>
One mother who worked a 4 to 11:45 p.m. shift called the system at night and 
set out time before breakfast to work with her child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More important than physically going to the school grounds, Bauch said, is "if 
teachers and parents have the same information base to support the child's 
learning.' 
</P>
<P>
"Face-to-face contact is good. But for busy people, it may be a luxury they 
cannot afford."

SOME SAY AMBURGEY WAS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY; 
</P>
<P>
THE COSTA MESA CITY COUNCILMAN'S COMBATIVE, OFTEN INFLEXIBLE STANCE, WHICH HAD 
WORKED FOR HIM IN THE PAST, PROBABLY COST HIM THIS ELECTION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbent Orville Amburgey went into Tuesday's City Council election with the 
largest war chest of any candidate, with a savvy campaign adviser, name 
recognition, a reputation for not backing down on issues and an almost 
unshakable confidence. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, however, he had lost his council seat, running fourth out of 
five candidates. And the community support that he had always claimed to have 
despite his often controversial views seemed suddenly to have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey blamed the media for his poor showing, claiming that articles 
published just before the election turned the tide against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to defend any of my actions," Amburgey said. "The response I have 
got from the public has been supportive. I'm not a politician, and my actions 
have never depended on public opinion. I do what I think is right." 
</P>
<P>
But many longtime city watchers said Tuesday's outcome was a predictable ending 
for a man who lacked the political astuteness to last for more than one term. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Amburgey's combative, often inflexible stance -- which helped 
get him elected four years ago -- probably cost him this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Amburgey was an unknown political factor, and his stubbornness may have 
given the appearance of decisive leadership. In practice, though, it translated 
into what observers saw as an unwillingness to compromise and to work with 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Some post-election analysts also believe that Costa Mesa voters decided they 
could do without Amburgey, who was willing to risk city funds in confronting a 
Cabinet member and who claimed a right to vote on any project before the 
council, even if it involved his son or his private electrical business -- now 
the target of conflict-of-interest charges and a district attorney's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case the negatives overwhelmed the money and name recognition," said 
former City Councilman Dave Wheeler, now an attorney practicing in Newport 
Beach. "Orv was never particularly bright or politically savvy, and he kind of 
behaved like a bull in a china shop." 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken councilman's method of operation proved a source of discomfort 
even for supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Orv has very strong ideas, but for whatever reason he tried to steam roll over 
people instead of trying to work with them," said former Mayor Ed McFarland, 
who supported Amburgey in 1986 but not this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was in how he accomplished his goals more than the goals 
themselves, I think. I didn't go to a lot of council meetings, but I watched 
them all on (cable) television, and I think a lot of other people do, too. They 
looked and saw the way he was treating people up there, and they didn't like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wheeler: "He acted with utter arrogance. . . . When you act with utter 
contempt of constituents in favor of your own personal interest or 
aggrandizement -- like he did in voting for his kid's (construction business) 
project. . . it leaves a bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey has been deflecting conflict-of-interest charges on his voting record 
almost since he assumed office. A former police officer with extensive business 
ties in the community, he received major backing from development concerns in 
1986 as well as this time around. 
</P>
<P>
C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons; Triangle Square; Metro Point; Robert Zeimer, 
manager of Henry and Harry's Goat Hill Tavern; the Newport Animal Hospital, and 
Amburgey-Carich Construction (owned by Amburgey's son, Ron) -- all were 
campaign contributors, and all had projects before the council at one time or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"The line is that Orv never met a project he didn't like," said one current 
city employee who requested anonymity. "Even if there may have been no 
wrongdoing involved, Orv never even worried about the appearance of 
impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city attorney in a report accused Amburgey of violating state 
conflict-of-interest laws when he voted on two occasions to approve agreements 
with a cable company his electrical firm was doing business with. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were turned over to the district attorney's office for 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey has denied any wrongdoing and has charged that the city attorney's 
report and its timing were politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland for one says Amburgey merely exposed his political naivete by 
refusing to recognize how his action might appear to the average citizen. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland also believes that Amburgey never had the community support that he 
claimed for controversial actions aimed against undocumented immigrants and the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey was accused in many quarters of the community -- and nation -- with 
pandering to racist sentiments when he sponsored unprecedented measures, one 
against soliciting work on city streets and another that denied city grant 
money to charities unless they pledged not to assist undocumented residents. 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called the anti-alien funding 
policy discriminatory and un-American. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey promptly embarked on a running personal feud with Kemp that many saw 
as another example of unnecessary defiance -- one that cast the city in an 
unfavorable light. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Jay Humphrey and Karen McGlinn (one of whom will claim the second 
council seat after a count of absentee ballots), both have said they might be 
willing to undo some of the Amburgey-sponsored measures should the council 
consider them again. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers see Tuesday's vote as a mandate for change in the city -- change 
that many feel had already begun to take shape even before the election in 
response to Amburgey and his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dalia Badajos, a businesswoman and member of Latinos for Costa 
Mesa, which began meeting last summer, said the simple fact that the group had 
formed may have had an impact on the outcome of the election by making people 
aware that there were other opinions out there that didn't necessarily coincide 
with Amburgey's. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the group was organized made people aware that there are issues 
that need to be dealt with," she said. "Even his longtime friends and 
supporters were no longer supporting him, and that is what our group is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The group had endorsed McGlinn and Humphrey, and some members helped their 
campaigns by posting signs and passing out literature.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL BOARD MAY NAME NEW TRUSTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School Board of Trustees will probably forgo a 
special election and appoint a new member to replace President Linda 
Moulton-Patterson, who was elected this week to the Huntington Beach City 
Council, board members said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees are expected to take up the matter at their Dec. 11 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Moulton-Patterson, the top vote-getter in last week's race for four council 
seats, has been on the school board since 1983. She said she will resign from 
the school board early next month, when she will join the council. 
</P>
<P>
Because a special election would cost the financially strapped district at 
least $75,000, trustees Jerry Sullivan and Bonnie Bruce said Thursday that they 
expect that the majority of board members would opt for appointing a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The new trustee will serve the remainder of Moulton-Patterson's board term, 
which expires in November, 1991. Her successor would then have to be reelected 
to retain the seat. 
</P>
<P>
If the new board member is appointed, trustees would begin accepting 
applications in late December and would probably fill the vacancy by February, 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the second board appointment in six months. In August, trustees 
appointed Bruce to the board, filling a vacancy created when member David 
Warfield resigned two months earlier. JOHN PENNER

ROADWORK PROJECTS WILL LINGER UNTIL '92

Coast Highway, the main thoroughfare through Newport Beach, has been under 
construction for about three years. But Public Works Director Ben Nolan says 
that while some portions are nearly finished, other phases to widen and improve 
the road won't be completed until 1992 and are expected to affect summer 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are three major roadwork projects under way in the city. The 
projects include widening of East Coast Highway between Bayside Drive and 
Jamboree Road, improvements and widening of West Coast Highway between Newport 
Boulevard and Highland Street, and the addition of a ramp and turning lane to 
the Newport Channel Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that work on East Coast Highway is nearly finished. The 
project was started in April, 1989, and is the second phase of cooperative city 
and federal project which also included road repairs as far east as MacArthur 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-million project, which City Manager Robert L. Wynn said was more than 
99% completed, was undertaken ease traffic congestion. The work included 
rehabilitation of the roadway, and widening the section of street to six lanes 
plus turning lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The city funded 14% of the cost of these repairs, and the remainder was 
financed by federal funds, according to city engineer John Wolter. 
</P>
<P>
The second Coast Highway construction project is about 70% done, Wynn said. For 
$12.1 million, public works officials say, the roadway between the Arches 
Bridge interchange and Highland Street was widened from four lanes to six. 
Ramps were added to Hoag Hospital property.LAURA MICHAELIS

HEALTHY EATING IS SUBJECT OF LECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who suffered a heart attack and underwent open-heart surgery at age 32 
will speak Thursday at Irvine Medical Center on his favorite subject: how to 
eat right for a healthy heart. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Piscatella, 45, will address a 12:30 p.m. seminar geared specifically to 
senior citizens and a 7 p.m. session for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Both lectures, sponsored by the hospital, are free, but reservations are 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Piscatella, a Tacoma resident, that he brought on his heart attack 
by eating a diet high in cholesterol and fat. 
</P>
<P>
He has since changed his ways and has written books on maintaining a healthy 
heart through a proper diet. He is currently taping a six-part public 
television series on health. 
</P>
<P>
To register for the lectures, call (800) 262-6210.

HEAT WAVE SHOULD TAKE LEAVE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A record-breaking heat wave during the weekend will not extend into today's 
Veterans Day activities, and the mercury is expected to continue dropping until 
Wednesday, when 70-degree weather is predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day hot spell, exacerbated by low-wind conditions, will begin easing by 
today, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which 
provides weather forecasts for the Times. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, hot, dry weather sent thousands of people outdoors to the parks and 
the beaches. In Newport Beach, where cooler temperatures prevailed, the high 
was a comfortable 78. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim reported 92 degrees, just two degrees cooler than the 94 achieved in 
Ventura County's Santa Paula, the hottest spot in the nation on Sunday, Burback 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's Monrovia and San Gabriel both reported 93 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend heat wave was attributed to a high pressure zone trapped above the 
entire West Coast for the past several days by two low pressure troughs, one in 
the Pacific Ocean and one over the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, El Toro reported 99 degrees, making it the nation's hot spot. But 
the warm easterly winds abated and onshore breezes blew over El Toro, cooling 
it to 83 on Sunday, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Northwest storm is expected to cool things off to the 70s and high 
60s beginning Tuesday, and extending through Thursday, before it warms up again 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the storm front should also bring some fairly moderate breezes and 
higher surf.DAVID REYES

EXPLOSIVE GOES OFF INSIDE U.S. MAILBOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosive device went off Sunday afternoon inside a U.S. mail box outside an 
East 4th Street commercial building. No injuries were reported and the device 
caused little damage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Kevin Brown described the explosive, which went off about 5 p.m., as 
"relatively minor," in terms of the extent of the damage to the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
The box is a drive-up type where motorists can deposit letters from their cars. 
It exploded in front of a building in the 1600 block of East 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts from the Orange County bomb detail were called in to inspect the 
damage, and to search for any other explosive devices that may have been in 
other mailboxes, Brown said. DAVID REYES

CHAMPION DIVER DIES AFTER CAR ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
CRASH: MEMBERS OF THE NADADORES SWIMMING AND DIVING TEAM MOURN THE LOSS OF 
TEAMMATE CHRISTOPHER VONK, 16, AN IRVINE HIGH JUNIOR.

Members of the Nadadores swimming and diving team in Orange County on Sunday 
mourned the death of Christopher Vonk, a 16-year-old teammate from Irvine who 
was a junior champion diver. 
</P>
<P>
Vonk died Saturday at 11:10 a.m. of head injuries suffered in a car accident in 
Mission Viejo about 2 p.m. last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Vonk lost control of his 
1966 Volkswagen while driving to diving practice in Mission Viejo. The car 
overturned on Trabuco Canyon Road, about a quarter-mile from Marguerite 
Parkway, and Vonk was thrown 50 feet from the vehicle, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where he died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Stoddard, chief swim coach of the Nadadores, said Sunday that the team 
had been in shock and mourning since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was hoping he'd pull through, and members of the diving team gathered 
together (Sunday) to remember him," Stoddard said. "He was a great diver -- one 
of the bright spots of the future -- a real hard worker who, when he came to 
practice, just got right to work and got his job done." 
</P>
<P>
Vonk was a member of the Nadadores team that won the national championship at 
the U.S. Junior Olympic Diving Championships in both 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Ely-Lagourgue, diving coach for the Nadadores, on Sunday said, "He loved 
the 10-meter and he was fearless on it. His death is a great loss to diving 
because he had a real future in national competition. He also was kind and a 
very fine person." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine High School junior was also a member of the school's surfing team. 
"He loved diving and surfing," his mother, Kathy Vonk, said. 
</P>
<P>
"He started diving when he was 9. You can't go to the nationals (of diving 
competition) until you're 11, and he went then, and he qualified every year 
since then," she said. "I think his proudest moment was last spring, when he 
was picked for the National Junior Olympic travel team to go to Germany. He did 
quite a lot in his few years." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his parents, Kathy and Hank Vonk, and two sisters, Gretchen, 
19, and Amy, 21. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral will be Wednesday at 1 p.m. at Pacific View Chapel, 3500 Pacific 
View Drive, Newport Beach, followed by burial in Pacific View Memorial Park in 
that city. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, expressions of 
sympathy take the form of donations to the Nadadores Diving Team.

MIKE PENNER: RAMS ARE THANKFUL FOR THE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through the plot of a real turkey -- Reversal of Fortune: The Rams in 
1990 -- John Robinson punched the eject button and dug out an old favorite to 
pop into the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson loved the cast: Jim Everett, Flipper Anderson, Mark Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Loved the story line, too: Bomb down the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
And, best of all, there was the outcome: Touchdown, Anderson. Victory; Rams. 
That's the way it was in January on a chilled afternoon at the Meadowlands with 
a berth in the NFC championship game on the line. And that's the way the Rams 
had it set up Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, with the Rams trailing the New York 
Giants by 10 points with seven minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was Everett, again, to Anderson, again, who had a step on Giant cornerback 
Collins again. The ball was there. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was there. 
</P>
<P>
Where did the touchdown go? 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know the difference between the near-miss Rams of 1989 and the 
nearly defunct Rams of 1990, you can sift through libraries of game film -- or 
you can check out this 10-second sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
The pass Flipper grips in New Jersey slips through his hands in Anaheim. The 
football hits the turf and soon after, so do the Rams, emotionally pummeled, 
never to recover. 
</P>
<P>
A potential 17-14 thriller returns to 17-7, which eventually becomes 24-7 and, 
finally, 31-7. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the Giants and Rams go their separate ways -- the Giants plodding 
onward to an apparent Dec. 3 battle royal in San Francisco, the Rams 
retrenching for next week's tossup against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
And there, alone in front of his locker stall, was Flipper, wondering where the 
rewind went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same situation," he said. "The same coverage. The same sideline. 
Everything." 
</P>
<P>
Except the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I just dropped it," he told wave after wave of reporters. "That's my forte -- 
catching the deep ball. If I make that catch, it's 17-14 and a whole different 
ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"I just dropped it." 
</P>
<P>
And what are the odds on that? 
</P>
<P>
"Willie Anderson catches that pass 19 out of 20 times," said Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of the time, Flipper makes that play," Everett said. 
Collins, still nursing January's scorch marks, couldn't believe his good 
fortune. At least in the playoff game, Collins had an excuse: He was running, 
unknowingly, on a broken foot. This time, there was nothing to blame. It was 
all in Anderson's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Collins couldn't believe the Rams' misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of surprised -- they're not the same team they were last year," 
Collins said. "They've got mostly the same people but they're sure not playing 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor concurred, though not with much sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to learn how to catch," Taylor said, looking down his nose. 
</P>
<P>
Got to learn how to score, too. This never used to be a problem with the Rams. 
Watching the Rams give up 31 points in a game is like watching the evening 
news. Turn on the TV and there it is. 
</P>
<P>
But one offensive touchdown this week after two offensive touchdowns last week 
after no offensive touchdowns the week before that? 
</P>
<P>
A closer look, by the numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pittsburgh 41, Rams 10. Gaston Green's game-opening kickoff return accounts 
for the Rams' only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rams 17, Houston 13. The Rams score no points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York 31, Rams 7. The Rams score their only points after Kevin Greene 
recovers Phil Simms' fumble on the Giant 11-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Subtract that fumble and the Rams, with Everett and Flipper and Henry Ellard 
and that Pro Bowl offensive line, own a scoreless streak of six consecutive 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense is in a slump," Robinson said. "What it's not doing is making the 
scoring-type play. We moved the football for the first three quarters about as 
well as you can against that team. We just aren't putting it in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"If Willie Anderson catches that pass, that's a touchdown. If we hold onto a 
couple more passes, maybe we get into the end zone again. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the end, we're missing on those plays. When that kind of thing keeps 
happening, yeah, you have to say we're in a slump." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the defenses of Pittsburgh, Houston and New York have been 
accomplices. All rank among the top half-dozen in the league. Before Sunday, 
the Giants were second overall -- third against the run and first against the 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
But to the members of the Ram offense, still proud if no longer loud, that fact 
only deepens the latest wound. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what we should be able to do against a good defense," Anderson said. 
"You'd think we could score on anybody with our offense. We've stopped doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Added Everett: "That's what concerns me most about this. We're not as effective 
as we used to be, as we should be, against very good defenses." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the Rams have come to expect their man holding onto the 
football when he is open beyond the secondary of a very good defense. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe this is all pay-back for those mile of miracles the Rams 
sprung again and again in 1989. The comeback against the Cowboys. The comeback 
against the Saints. The comeback against the Giants. They didn't come for free. 
Maybe now, the bill has arrived in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the Rams are paying through the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Through the hands, too.

RAMS' PLANS DON'T FOOL GIANT DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: NEW YORK'S DEFENSE, WHICH GAVE UP 31 POINTS IN LAST YEAR'S GAME, 
GIVES UP ONLY ONE TOUCHDOWN SUNDAY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chants reverberating through the tunnels of the stadium -- Anaheim Stadium 
-- were meant in praise of the New York Giants' record. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine-and-oh! Nine-and-oh!" 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, they praised the Giant defense as well. 
</P>
<P>
Seven offenses -- the Cowboys and Redskins twice -- have sent their schemes and 
best-laid plans against the Giants this season. 
</P>
<P>
And none has walked away with more than 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Four of those teams have failed to score more than one touchdown. It was that 
group that the Rams joined Sunday, as an offense that even Giant linebacker 
Pepper Johnson calls explosive was stifled in a 31-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
It was not quite the same Giant defense you -- or the Rams -- once knew. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor did not spend the afternoon as close to Jim Everett as center 
Doug Smith. In fact, the Giants had only two sacks, and Taylor had neither of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
And this certainly did not look like the Giant defense the Rams scored 31 
points against in a regular-season game last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Their scheme is the same," said Everett, who was intercepted three times. 
"They're just playing it better." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Gary Reasons, who intercepted Everett twice in the fourth quarter as 
the Rams pressed in hopes of another touchdown, laughed at the thought that the 
defense was any different. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot different," he said. "We kept the points down." 
</P>
<P>
That is what they have been doing all season, with a defense that is ranked 
second overall and first against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
They did it without a dominating game from Taylor, without linebacker Carl 
Banks, who is out with an injured arm, without any overwhelming individual 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons deflected a third-down pass meant for Ellard, stifling a Ram possession 
in the third quarter when the Giant lead was only 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson helped keep the pressure on Everett, and the secondary staved off those 
famous Ram deep strikes. 
</P>
<P>
It is a secondary comprised of such veterans as Everson Walls and Dave Duerson, 
as well as Mark Collins, the cornerback out of Cal State Fullerton, and two 
youngsters, safety Myron Guyton, in his second season out of Eastern Kentucky, 
and Greg Jackson, a second-year free safety out of Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had one of the two sacks, and six unassisted tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Guyton was there to defend a critical third-down pass meant for Ellard late in 
the second half. Then Walls was there in the end zone on a last, desperate Ram 
possession, coming down with a tipped pass meant for Derrick Faison. 
</P>
<P>
With about seven minutes left, the Rams faced a fourth-and-nine, but were put 
to rest by Johnson and Guyton on a last-gasp play. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had Everett in his grasp the moment the pass was off, and Guyton made 
certain Ellard didn't catch it. 
</P>
<P>
So there wasn't sack after glorious sack, so what? 
</P>
<P>
"I think sacks are overrated," Reasons said. "They're big plays, but they're 
not total defense. They're just a part of the game. I know we'll always get the 
pressure and it's difficult for quarterbacks to throw against that." 
</P>
<P>
Everett could tell you that, as could his counterpart, Phil Simms, who watched 
from a more comfortable angle. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense? The defense was magnificent," Simms said. "That's the best 
defensive effort I've seen in a long time against a team so explosive."

COLLEGE DIVISION BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
BOYD HAS HIGH HOPES FOR CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the few things unfamiliar to well-traveled basketball coach Bob Boyd is 
success in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., the conference of his 
latest employer -- Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Boyd's first at the college in Orange, Chapman finished in a tie 
for last place with Cal Poly Pomona. Last week, Boyd called Boise State Coach 
Bobby Dye, someone with great -- although brief -- success in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Dye had won two conference titles in as many seasons at Cal State Bakersfield 
in the early 1980s. Boyd asked him which CCAA schools were in the best position 
to excel in men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said Dye, who also coached at Cal State Fullerton for seven years during 
the 1970s, told him Bakersfield was in the best position because of facilities 
and community support. Dye also mentioned a few other promising schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he thought that Chapman is one of those better places to get it 
done from," Boyd said. "But I think that the school here has given us the 
wherewithal -- we now have 10 full scholarships for basketball -- and I think 
the school has a right to expect that we are going to have a successful program 
in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"By that I mean we're going to win our share, if not more than our share, of 
games." 
</P>
<P>
With preseason confidence befitting someone with 28 seasons of experience 
coaching college basketball at the Division I, Division II and Community 
College levels, Boyd promised last week that Chapman would be a better team. He 
also promised he would do a better job coaching the Panthers this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I got our team prepared as well as I should have (last 
season)," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who has coached at Seattle University, USC and Mississippi State as well 
as Riverside and Santa Ana colleges, has added key players, altered Chapman's 
offense and boosted the players' conditioning program. He also said a new video 
system will allow the coaching staff to better analyze the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a great time," Boyd said. "I think I'm trying harder then I've ever 
tried." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and two other Orange County colleges -- Christ College Irvine and 
Southern California College -- open the season this weekend. Pacific Christian 
College in Fullerton started its season with five victories last week. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the season ends, there are certain to be answers to a few 
questions, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Southern California College and Pacific Christian duplicate their 
successes in postseason competition? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How successful will Christ College Irvine's Greg Marshall be in his first 
season as a head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Boyd lead Chapman to its first NCAA playoff berth since 1984? 
</P>
<P>
The following is a closer look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHAPMAN 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 11-16, 3-11 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Tied for last with Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd is confident the Panthers will right themselves after their disappointing 
performance last season. Chapman will probably start three players who started 
a year ago -- post players Rog Middleton and Frantz Reyes and guard Andre Hill 
-- but Boyd believes newcomers in the other two spots and extra team depth will 
prove the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Transfers Al Jackson and Zlatko Josic figure to start at point guard and 
forward, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson last played organized basketball for West Valley College in the 1987-88 
season, averaging 11 points and 4.5 assists and leading his team to its first 
state community college playoff berth in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Josic, a 6-5, 230-pound forward, helped El Camino College to the semifinals of 
the state Community College tournament in 1989. He played in five games for 
Clemson last season before quitting the team because he was unhappy with his 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said three other newcomers -- Chuck McGavran, a guard from Newport Harbor, 
Orange Coast and Cal State Northridge; Alan Schlines, a 6-6 forward from 
Foothill High and Orange Coast, and Lesean London, a point guard from 
Saddleback College -- will provide the help from the bench Chapman needed last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the Panthers will still be Middleton, who led the team in 
scoring (20 points per game) and rebounding (10 per game). Middleton, a 6-4 
junior from Tustin High, recently was cited by The Sporting News as one of the 
top 25 small college players in the nation. He should be even more effective 
with help inside. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said Reyes, a Cypress High graduate who was the team's second-leading 
scorer (13 per game) and rebounder (eight per game) but had some motivational 
problems last season, has improved his attitude and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of Jackson, Hill and Chris Martin, another guard who had 
extensive playing time last year, will be able to move to off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought our back-court play was probably our most inconsistent position 
last year," Boyd said. "The additional players and the improvement of the ones 
that we have should really help us. We turned the ball over too many times last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we will be quite good and our transition to offense will be good 
because we will break the ball up the court rather successfully, I think." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRIST COLLEGE IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 11-20, 3-9 in the Golden State Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Fifth in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a late start recruiting and only two returning starters, Marshall 
plans to keep things slow for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we'll be more up-tempo in the coming years but now we are going to try 
to limit the possessions," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he emphasizes defense, keeping his team close in games against 
more talented teams. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that Marshall hasn't any talent to work with. Last year, as 
Westmont's top assistant coach, he scouted CCI and said the Eagles were 
building a competitive program. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are Kevin Kurz, who averaged 16 points and six rebounds per game, and 
Albert Gay, who averaged 13 points and four rebounds. Senior guard Jamie McShan 
and 6-6 senior forward Keith Rogers are back. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting wasn't easy for Marshall, who said one of his top prospects decided 
to go to the University of Florida. But two of the players he brought in -- Ian 
Donnelly, a 6-6 forward from Cypress College, and Corey Smith, a guard from 
Glendora High School -- should get significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Clasen, a 6-2 guard, joined the team late after the Eagles' soccer season 
ended, but Marshall is hoping he can help with the Eagles offensive production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC CHRISTIAN COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 31-10, 10-0 in the California Coastal Conference, 10-0 in the 
Western Christian Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First in each conference. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Christian, a 600-student school across the street from Cal State 
Fullerton, has developed into a Christian college basketball powerhouse in the 
four seasons Lee Erickson has been coach. 
</P>
<P>
In his second season (1987-88), Erickson led Pacific Christian to its first 
winning men's basketball season in more than a decade and into the semifinals 
of the National Christian College Athletic Assn. national tournament. The 
Royals have made the finals of that tournament the last two years, losing each 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But with the loss of four of six players who averaged in double figures last 
season -- including three-time All-American Brian Keiser, who averaged 21 
points per game last year -- Erickson is worried that the Royals will have some 
trouble this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we probably created a monster by doing well and I think people have 
decided to catch us," Erickson said. "I think instead of catching us, they 
might pass us up." 
</P>
<P>
With honorable mention All-American Mike Vincent, a 6-4 forward who averaged 
about 17 points per game last year, and guard Kenny Kao, who averaged 6.5 
assists, returning, the Royals don't figure to be hurting too badly. PCC is 5-0 
after a week of play, having won easily in the Western Christian Athletic 
Conference's preseason tournament over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 26-9, 9-3 in the Golden State Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First in NAIA District 3, first in the Golden State Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
No team has won consecutive NAIA District 3 titles since Biola did it to start 
the 1980s. Southern California College Coach Bill Reynolds said his team will 
be hard pressed to be the next. 
</P>
<P>
Without second-leading scorer Terry Scruggs, who averaged 18 points and five 
rebounds per game last season, and point guard John Mounce, who averaged 11 
points per game, the Vanguards face replacing a big chunk of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have quite the firepower we've had in the past," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the quality of shooters that we have had. We may push the ball 
up the floor but we won't be pulling up for the shots off the break as much." 
</P>
<P>
Returning are 6-7 senior center Jeff Bickmore, the Golden State Athletic 
Conference player of the year who averaged 19.2 points and 7.8 rebounds per 
game last year, and 6-3 junior forward Mike Henjum, who led the conference in 
three-point shooting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
There's a four-player competition for the starting point guard spot. The 
hopefuls: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elbert Davis, a key player off the bench last season who might be slowed by 
an ankle injury he suffered in a pickup game late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jason Quinn, who helped Mater Dei High School to the state championship 
last year, could be the first freshman in Reynolds' memory to get significant 
playing time for the Vanguards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brad Dorias, a 5-8 junior college transfer from Eastern Wyoming College. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ronald Scipio, a former Los Angeles City College player who was an 
assistant coach at Manual Arts High the last four years.

LORAL CORP. MAY WIND UP 'GETTING A GOOD ASSET FREE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dean Takahashi, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive of New York-based Loral 
Corp., doesn't make any apologies for the fact that his $3.2 million in 
compensation made him the defense industry's highest-paid executive last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked recently about his compensation, Schwartz said: "We're in a competitive 
market and we pay well for good performance. I'm reminded of a remark made by 
Babe Ruth when he was asked why he made more money than the President. He said, 
'Well, I had a better year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wall Street has long regarded the 64-year-old executive as a savvy 
businessman. And, as Schwartz says, he has had a very good year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Middle East crisis began in August, Schwartz believed he could 
find hidden values in the defense industry, which many on Wall Street had 
written off after the warming of U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz believes he's found just such a hidden jewel in Ford Aerospace Corp., 
the Newport Beach-based defense subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. In July, Loral and 
its partner, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., announced plans to acquire Ford 
Aerospace for $715 million, outbidding two other rivals who had more financial 
resources than Loral. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ford Aerospace, Loral gained a company with revenue of $1.8 billion and 
17,000 employees, including 2,600 at the Aeronutronic missile division in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the sale closed, however, Schwartz was making deals. He agreed in 
September to sell Ford's BDM International consulting division for $130 
million. In late October, Schwartz announced that he would sell 49% of Ford 
Aerospace's space systems division in Palo Alto for $182 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the long-profitable defense electronics company expects combined 
sales in excess of $3 billion as a result of the Ford purchase. It also expects 
continuing profits despite the bleak outlook for many contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense analyst, said Schwartz's purchase of 
Ford Aerospace is looking smarter every day in light of the Persian Gulf crisis 
and the amount of money the asset sales have generated for Loral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, he (Schwartz) will wind up getting a good asset for free," 
Beltramo said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquired company in Newport Beach will be known as Loral Aerospace, a 
subsidiary of Loral Corp. In a recent interview with Times staff writer Dean 
Takahashi, Schwartz discussed the Ford Aerospace acquisition, Pentagon budget 
cuts and the impact of the Mideast crisis on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. A lot of companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Unisys Corp. are diversifying 
out of the defense business these days. What is scaring these people away from 
the defense industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there are a number of things. The perception that the defense budget 
is declining and may be vulnerable to sharp cuts in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there is the general perception that everyone is unfriendly to the 
defense industry. Some of that perception has been caused by the Department of 
Defense itself, which is just emerging from a time when there has been a lot of 
contractor bashing in the media, in the defense circles, in financial circles. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of both of those issues, it's harder to secure financing for 
defense projects, and that is another negative or cost of being in the defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You obviously think the rewards of the industry are worth the risks. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. I think there's a difference between the reality and the perception in 
this case. The perception of the industry cuts have been overstated and fully 
discounted the values of the business. Secondly, I believe the worst has passed 
as far as the defense industrial base is concerned. Both the government and the 
industry recognize that a viable and healthy industrial base is an important 
part of national security. 
</P>
<P>
We as an industry have been living in an atmosphere of no-growth budgets for 
five or six years. Loral still sees opportunities because we're on the cutting 
edge of technology. We've grown throughout this period. Our experience is 
different from the perception. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Regardless of what is happening right now in the Persian Gulf, what is the 
outlook for the defense industry over the next five years? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the defense budget will continue to be under pressure because the 
political resolution of the deficit has not really been achieved. Because of 
the Gulf and the recognition that the world is still dangerous to America's 
interests, the expected Draconian cuts will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I believe there will be reallocation of defense resources toward 
mobile, fast-response and high-technology capability. The total amount of 
defense may be the same, but there will be new priorities to reflect the new 
realities. Therefore, some will win and some will lose. 
</P>
<P>
Q. On a more immediate level, what is the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis for 
the defense industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there will be some winners and some losers. The high-tech, 
electronic segment, fast-response, highly mobile capabilities will be winners. 
I think there may be a reorganization away from the kind of threat that Russia 
posed to us five years ago. The total amount of defense may be the same but 
there will be a new priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Everybody is preparing for some kind of defense budget crunch and also 
changing their plans as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis. What is Loral 
doing different? 
</P>
<P>
A. For one thing, we're concentrating in five or six core business areas. We 
have been doing that for a period of years, and we believe that those choices 
have turned out to be fortunate ones in terms of today's relevancy. 
</P>
<P>
They are self-protect; reconnaissance; training; anti-submarine warfare; 
command, control and communications; and now space. We believe each one of 
those is going to be a growth area because they represent the priorities of the 
Defense Department. We positioned ourselves in those areas that continue to get 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Analysts are saying your purchase of Ford Aerospace is looking smarter every 
day. If you had to purchase Ford Aerospace Corp. today, do you think you would 
have to pay more than the $715 million? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the answer to that is probably, yes. Loral, in effect, has educated 
the marketplace as to the hidden values of Ford Aerospace. There were elements 
within Ford Aerospace that were considered negatives that are turning out to be 
positives. Having brought the harsh light of scrutiny to those issues, I think 
the values would have been increased and would be perceived to be more valuable 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you expect a war in the Persian Gulf? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's a tough question because it's a political question. I don't pretend 
to be able to calibrate that issue for the government. I think the President 
has a tough decision because there are some important political objectives that 
need to be accomplished in any settlement in the Gulf. Not the least of which 
is this country must not be setting diplomatic and economic objectives staring 
down the barrel of a hostile gun. We have to resolve that issue, but I think it 
would benefit everybody if we did it peacefully, thereby using our strength in 
a deterrent way, rather than in a hostile way. I hope we can achieve our 
objectives without hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. According to Wall Street, you've estimated $100 million in additional 
revenue in 1991 as a result of the buildup in the Mideast. Is that accurate, 
and if so, how will that break down? 
</P>
<P>
A. That is not accurate. What we have done is identify $100 million worth of 
potential bookings that could be made in a year's time, but there would be a 
longer lag in the revenue base. I think the booking potential is a little 
higher than when I made that estimate a month ago. There is a long tail to it, 
and it will take a couple of years to realize that in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Based on the media coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis, what sort of image 
do you think the defense industry has in the mind of the public? Is this a 
better image than, say, 10 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think so. I think most people realize if we get a peaceful solution, it 
could not have been achieved without the deterrence of a strong military. If 
there are hostilities, I think everybody will want our men and women to be 
protected by the best equipment available. I think there will be a new 
recognition that American interests are global and can only be protected from 
time to time by military capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Loral has stayed away from big-ticket items in the defense budget. Do you 
expect certain programs will be cut in the next five years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. I'm reluctant to get into a debate as to which ones. I think there will 
be a change in priorities away from the kind of weapons systems that were 
important when two global powers were confronting each other to more regional 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
More geared to the kind of conflicts that will arise from the Gulf, Central 
America, the Pacific Rim -- there are many areas of the world that are 
potentially dangerous and will affect America's interests and the civility of 
the free world. Our deterrent power will be called into play. There is a shift 
and that shift is very profound. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think there is ever going to be something like a peace dividend? If 
so, how soon will it come? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there will be a significant peace dividend and it will take a couple 
of years to get there. The GNP is expected to rise above the present level of 
defense spending, and the difference is going to the peace dividend. If, in 
1995, we're spending not 3% but 2% of GNP on defense, we're talking a 
$100-billion-a-year peace dividend that can be available for very proper uses 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe a recession is here or coming? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm not an economist, but it sure feels that way. I travel around the 
country, and I've found that not many industries or companies feel good about 
their bookings. So much of our economy depends on consumers. If we have a good 
Christmas season, that will soften the blow. I'm optimistic it won't be a long 
one or a severe one, but I think we're in one. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think that is going to spell more layoffs for the aerospace industry? 
Have we seen the worst of layoffs? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think we have had the worst impact, though this is not to say there won't 
be some adjustments going forward in various companies. I think there will be 
continued consolidation in the industry, and that in itself will create 
dislocations that for a temporary period might be reflected in layoffs. But 
from a recession point of view, I think we've seen the worst of it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there much hope for defense contractors to look overseas for sales as the 
domestic defense budget decreases? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. I think places like Europe will produce a great deal of protectionism 
for the European defense industry. But there will be increased requirements for 
countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt and the Gulf area. That will 
provide very good opportunities for Americans. I think the same will happen in 
Japan. I think around the world, overseas opportunities will be a significant 
part of the high-tech defense industry's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does that create a concern that some of our weapons might be used against us 
or our friends? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. I'm hopeful the appropriate agencies in the government will be 
very conservative before granting licenses. For the United States, the 
high-tech weapon has always been important. I think there's an opportunity to 
help our allies overseas with weapons that do not compromise America's lead in 
high technology. I think we can do both if we're smart. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Getting back to the Ford Aerospace deal, Loral is allowing Ford Motor Co. to 
keep $100 million from Ford Aerospace's overfunded pension fund, correct? 
</P>
<P>
A. Ford is not letting us keep it. The arrangement was they transferred to 
Loral an amount that kept the pension fund intact and transferred a surplus 
above the requirement. Above that amount, they kept a certain amount. They 
transferred to Loral sufficient and surplus funds to take care of all the 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have seen a copy of a January, 1989, report from the Defense Department's 
inspector general's office that estimates the government had a claim of about 
$90.9 million out of a total of $527.3 million in excess pension assets after 
11 defense contractors' plans were terminated between 1982 and 1987. Do you 
think the Pentagon has any claim on the money that Ford is keeping? 
</P>
<P>
A. I haven't seen that report. Everything you've seen in print up to this point 
is speculation. The government has not maintained a claim -- they have not said 
they won't but they have not yet done so -- and there's been no quantification 
of what that claim might be. There's been all kinds of speculation of how to 
compute that. It's a very complex issue, having to do with what portion of the 
pension assets came from overseas, what came from commercial activities over 
which the DoD would have no claim, what portion came from fixed-price versus 
other types of contracts, how much was charged by Ford Motor Co. to the 
government. It's a complex issue, and no claim has been made. If they did make 
it, I don't know how it would stand in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Q. As far as your 17,000 new employees are concerned, do you think there was a 
political risk to that transaction involving pension assets? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I think the interest of the employees was to make sure that there were 
adequate assets to protect the expected liabilities. Beyond that, the 
employees' interests end. They have an interest in making sure the integrity of 
the plan was taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you expect any other big changes with Ford Aerospace? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I think we've done the things we wanted to do. We've sold BDM and the 
part of the space systems unit. Now our goal is to get synergies from the 
combination of the companies. We're well on our way to that. I'm very pleased 
about the progress. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In Southern California, there's a lot of concern about aerospace companies 
leaving the area because of the high costs of manufacturing here. In the long 
term, how big a problem is this, and how much of a factor is this to your 
company strategy? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't like to move plants, I can tell you that. Our commitment to our work 
force is a significant positive for why we're successful as a company. I'm not 
suggesting there's never a need to close a plant or move an operation. I don't 
foresee any of that in Loral's arena. We have an eight-year lease with the 
Aeronutronic operation. After six years, the rent goes up quite a bit, so we 
have to look as management for a way to solve that problem. That is not a 
unique problem since we have a lot of leased property. You work out what you 
have to work out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In six years, you'll be paying $1 million a month to rent the Newport Beach 
land. Will you be able to make missile products profitably with that lease? 
</P>
<P>
A. We think it's profitable now and it will continue to be profitable. When the 
rent factor becomes uneconomic -- and I have to tell you that's generally not 
the reason companies relocate -- management has to do some things to respond. 
We think we're in good shape. If we can go out and book new business and raise 
the level of business activity at Aeronutronic, the rent portion will be 
unimportant. The division management and Loral's viewpoint are the same. This 
is not a decision that will be made by me in New York. What to do with the 
facility when we face that issue is not going to be decided in an isolated 
place away from Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the most important programs for Aeronutronic right now? 
</P>
<P>
A. The most important potential program is the U.S. Navy's AIM-9R missile. If 
that goes into production, Aeronutronic is going to have a very large program. 
Getting the F-18 forward-looking infrared pod (an electronic warfare device) 
into production in good shape . . . is an important part of Aeronutronic's 
future. Because of the situation in the Persian Gulf, the Chapparral missile 
program is going to be (important to the Newport Beach unit). 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some of your employees will no doubt be reading this. What sort of message 
would you like to impart to them? 
</P>
<P>
A. You can tell them I'm extremely pleased with the progress we have made in 
becoming one family. I feel confident we have a cultural and a community 
objective that will be mutually good for everyone. Their joining the Loral 
family is a significant plus for us. I'm excited as the devil.

KICKING UP A NEW DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
LINGERING PREJUDICES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GIRLS' SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LEWISVILLE, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At halftime of a recent soccer game here for girls under 12, two fathers of 
players on one team walked onto the field. Talking to the referee and the rival 
coach near the goal, one parent allegedly made a unique request. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted his wife to take three of our girls . . . into the bathroom and 
verify that they were girls," said Joe Johnson, coach of the Lewisville Blaze. 
"I said 'No way!' and probably a few other vulgar things. I got very upset. . . 
. The request was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The story made its way into the local newspaper, the Lewisville Leader, and to 
the papers in Dallas and Ft. Worth, about 25 miles to the south. Soon it spread 
to Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, the Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Green, managing editor of the Leader, said the incident focused more 
attention on the rapidly growing community of 47,000 than any event since a 
Woodstock-style concert in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in town has been talking about it," said Mike Wood, president of the 
Lewisville Soccer Assn. "Last year we had about 1,900 kids playing soccer. You 
have roughly double that in parents, and you have grandparents and referees. 
It's been all over town." 
</P>
<P>
But the "panty check" story did not end there. Although the two fathers angrily 
denied the allegations, the North Texas State Soccer Assn. suspended one father 
from all games until the end of the fall season and banished the other until 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
And the incident raised perplexing questions about the future of girls' sports. 
Were the Texas fathers accused of making the remarks part of a small minority, 
or do they speak for a large but less vocal community of men who still can't 
accept girls as exceptional athletes? And would this highly publicized episode 
affect girls' willingness to compete, undermining decades of growing female 
participation in sports? 
</P>
<P>
Among a pediatrician and a dozen sociologists and psychologists contacted by 
The Times, a few said the incident could affect girls sports negatively. 
</P>
<P>
"If that thinking (of the fathers) prevailed," said Anne Marie Bird, chair of 
the physical education department at Cal State Fullerton, "little girls 
wouldn't go into sports because their femininity would be questioned. I think 
it would be very threatening (to women's sports.)" 
</P>
<P>
But the overwhelming majority viewed the alleged remarks of the Texas fathers 
as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of incredulity that these men demonstrated borders on irrationality," 
said Don Sabo, a sports sociologist at D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y., and 
co-author of a recent book, "Sport, Men and the Gender Order." 
</P>
<P>
"The surveys done during the last decade indicate a tremendous shift in 
attitudes toward girls' participation in athletics," Sabo said. "Overall, 
parents are supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Snyder, a sports psychologist who is programs director of the Women's 
Sports Foundation in New York, said she didn't think the remarks would hurt 
girls' athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the same kind of incident as when (Los Angeles Dodgers general 
manager) Al Campanis made his remarks about blacks," she said. "We look at it 
and say it's outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be vigilant and make sure the opportunities are there for girls, 
but I don't think there is going to be a backlash." 
</P>
<P>
That was good news to Natasha Dennis, 10, the Lewisville Blaze goalie who was 
only 9 when she was apparently asked to prove she was a girl in the Sept. 29 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Dennis' house, a few blocks east of Interstate 35 in Lewisville, is a 
wooden garage with paint chipping from the white siding. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis has appreciably aided the chipping on one wall by frequently lining up 
15 soccer balls on the dirt and kicking them one at a time against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she kicks for hours at night under the bright light extending upward 
from the garage roof. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening two fire trucks lumbered up her block, sirens screaming and 
bright lights flashing, and stopped in front of her house. Neighbors poured out 
of homes on both sides of the street to see what was wrong. Natasha never 
stopped kicking her soccer ball. The trucks had been called for a small stove 
fire in a house across the street. But for Dennis, only the competitive fires 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, who stands 4 feet, 5 inches tall, has been playing soccer five years. 
In addition to performing on Lewisville Soccer Assn. teams twice a year, she is 
the only girl who plays in boys soccer games at her school during recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when other players come in on me getting ready to kick," said 
Dennis, who wore black soccer shoes with shorts and a T-shirt as she talked to 
a reporter in her living room recently. "I like being able to stop that. I like 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think girls can play better than boys if we try our best and practice." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Carpenter, a professor of physical education at Brooklyn College, said 
that the dedication Dennis shows is a hallmark of exceptional athletes -- male 
and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence takes commitment and it takes the same kind whether you're male or 
female," said Carpenter, who attended Dorsey High School in Los Angeles and 
earned her Ph.D. from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to look pretty far to find an exceptional athlete who grew 
up not putting an extraordinary effort into that part of their life." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists say men are beginning to understand the efforts women make to 
excel, and that their understanding may be reflected in attitudes supporting 
girls athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo and Snyder base their optimism about men's attitudes in large part on a 
1987 telephone study for the Women's Sports Foundation. Researchers contacted 
1,004 parents and 513 of their 7- to 18-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that "parents show very little concern that sports may be 
unladylike." Ninety-seven percent of the fathers and mothers agreed that sports 
provide important benefits to girls. The idea that sports are equally important 
for boys and girls was generally accepted by 87%. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, sociologists and psychologists said there was every reason to believe 
that girls 9 and 10 years old could play as well as, if not better than, boys. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Lippe, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of 
endocrinology at the UCLA Medical Center, said that the hormones that change 
boys' strength, such as testosterone, don't appear until puberty, which usually 
starts at 11 1/2 or 12. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Sports Foundation, Snyder agreed. "In third- and fourth-grade 
class pictures, girls are the tallest and often the strongest, and its not 
unusual for girls to be better athletes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a bunch of girls and trained them exactly the same as boys until 
they reached 11 or 12, there's a good chance girls would beat boys." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to possessing abilities similar to boys, many young American girls 
have honed their skills in recent decades by competing in rapidly proliferating 
teams and leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Sports Foundation study reported that 87% of girls 7 to 10 and 84% 
of girls 11 to 14 are involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder added that 294,000 girls competed in high school sports in 1971, but the 
number increased to 1,839,000 girls along with 3,417,000 boys in 1988-89, the 
last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take out 950,000 (boys) playing football, we're getting a lot closer to 
parity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting girls' improvement in gymnastic scores and times for track events, 
Snyder said, "It shouldn't be surprising to anybody . . . that when you begin 
making opportunity available, girls have been improving at all levels of 
competition at a much faster rate than men over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Carole Oglesby, a sports psychologist who chairs the department of physical 
education at Temple University in Philadelphia, says record-setting performers 
or other superb athletes won't be affected by disparaging remarks about their 
femininity. 
</P>
<P>
"If a young woman shows spectacular promise," Oglesby said, "then her parents 
and coaches will pick up on that and see all that collegiate or Olympic 
competition might offer. She's going to stay with it and get all the positive 
support that goes with those activities." 
</P>
<P>
Oglesby, a graduate of Baldwin Park High School and UCLA, said she's concerned 
that the barbs may drive away average performers who will miss the joys and 
lessons of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large group of people in the middle of the normal curve of girls 
who will say if people are going to hassle me about this (femininity), I'm not 
going to stay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the spectacular athlete is the one that men have most trouble accepting, 
Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about these two fathers in Texas, I picture them as very 
traditional males who have difficulty accepting a girl's athletic ability in 
non-stereotypical terms," Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When this man sees a woman who can bench-press 220 pounds or run a five-minute 
mile, or who can kick his butt in volleyball or baseball, he has no category in 
his mind to put that kind of woman. So he has to turn her into a male to deal 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Harris, a sports psychologist and a professor of exercise and sports 
science at Penn State University, said many men think women are inferior 
athletes because those men have confused notions of skill and size or strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati . . . who are superb 
tennis players and will be ranked as the best in the world, and yet a male 
ranked 50th could probably beat a woman ranked No. 1," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The men can have unorthodox strokes and be less skilled, but can compensate 
through strength and quickness. In many cases, women's matches are more 
interesting because there is more strategy." 
</P>
<P>
While Natasha Dennis can boot a soccer ball 40 or 50 yards, the slender goalie 
would hardly be considered powerful. 
</P>
<P>
She plays soccer because she likes it -- better than skateboarding, better than 
jumping on her trampoline and better than playing football with her 
neighborhood friends. 
</P>
<P>
She also likes it better than wearing dresses or skirts, which she has refused 
to do for two years. On a recent evening, Linda Dennis said her daughter was 
old enough to choose her clothing style, but that she would love Natasha to put 
on a blue jean skirt with a ruffle on the bottom and a pink blouse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a gagging sound was heard from the other side of the room where 
Natasha was sitting on the rug. She had a finger in her mouth, reacting in mock 
horror to her mother's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like dresses. They're dorky," said Natasha, whose hair is short and 
curly with a wisp of a ponytail in the style of Joe McIntyre of New Kids on the 
Block. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dennis continued describing the loafers and the long hair with French 
braids she'd like for Natasha. This time a quiet voice said, "Now you're going 
a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
Natasha had left the living room but had partially returned, sticking her head 
in the doorway to protest. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Natasha's practice is paying off. She is one of the best players 
on her team and had allowed only seven goals in her first seven games while her 
team had scored 39. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Linda Dennis was surprised and angered when she heard that 
fathers on a rival team had requested that Natasha prove she was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had sent me into the bathroom with a mother to look down Natasha's 
pants," she said, "that mother wouldn't have come out. She would have been torn 
up and flushed down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lewisville team refused the request for a gender check and won the 
game, 3-1, Linda Dennis walked her daughter across the field to meet her 
purported accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached one of the men and said, 'I'd like you to meet my daughter, 
Natasha,' "Dennis said. "He stopped and took a step back -- like he'd seen a 
ghost -- and said, 'Nice game, boy!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, it's good game, girl, or good game, kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Good game, son,' and reached over and patted her shoulder." 
</P>

ANN CONWAY: THEY BLEND HOSPITALITY WITH MYSTIQUE

Sometimes it isn't easy, living in a landmark by the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The tour boats cruise by, says Beverly Cohen, and the guides announce: "This 
was John Wayne's house. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's Bob and Beverly Cohen's house and they're in Europe for three years." 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if people need to feel his home is untouched," Beverly says, 
whispering. "That it's still his. We have to be very careful. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So the party-loving Cohens, who bought the Newport Beach bay home last year for 
a breathtaking $6.5 million, are making changes slowly. They've raised the roof 
in the sprawling, buff-tone living room. Installed a magnificent archway 
entrance to the dining room. Created a plant-filled breakfast room on the 
patio. And there are plans for a second-story master suite and guest quarters 
for each of their three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
But the marble bathroom sinks that were built tall for the tall actor remain. 
And, for now, so do the bayside bedrooms the Duke shared with his wife, Pilar, 
and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
Those details still thrill visitors to the Cohen house. And nobody knows it 
better than Beverly, who divides her time between Newport Beach and Beverly 
Hills (where she holds court with Bob in a 4,000-square-foot penthouse in the 
Four Seasons Hotel, which they own). "You get the feeling that people don't 
want any part of the house destroyed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Wayne mystique and the Cohen hospitality make for grand party-giving. Last 
year, Beverly staged celebrity-studded soirees almost every night of the 
Newport Beach boat parade (Author Joseph Wambaugh was a guest; so were composer 
-- the "Rocky" theme -- Carol Connors, hair mogul Vidal Sassoon, songbird 
Marilyn McCoo and fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell.) 
</P>
<P>
This year will be no exception, with two of Beverly's pet-charity bashes having 
premier price tags. On Dec. 19, supporters of Heritage Pointe -- a Jewish home 
for the aged -- will donate $10,000 per couple to dine and watch the boat 
parade. And on Dec. 17, couples will pay $1,000 to attend a fund-raiser for 
Parent Help USA, an organization dedicated to the prevention of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"They just recently called me," Beverly says of Parent Help, her newest cause 
(annually, Beverly helps raise more than $600,000 for the Sephardic Hebrew 
Academy in Los Angeles.) "And when I met them, I could see they're giving their 
time freely to help children. That is what impresses me about an organization 
-- that they feel so strongly about a cause they spend every minute of every 
day helping others. 
</P>
<P>
"My children are my life. I can't imagine anybody having children and then 
abusing them." 
</P>
<P>
Her dream for a drop-dead party guest on the 17th? None other than Sly 
Stallone. "I go to his acupuncturist," Beverly says with a wide smile. "I'm 
working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Having a party is like putting on a play, Beverly says. "People love to come to 
a fantasy, mingle with stars. You've got to think big." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner with his head-turner: Local members of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility (PSR) bestowed their first Eisenhower Award upon media mogul Ted 
Turner at UC Irvine's University Club last week. The award will be given 
annually to a citizen who has made outstanding contributions to the cause for 
world peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted Turner's network has carried innumerable programs regarding the nuclear 
threat, arms control and citizen-to-citizen diplomacy," said PSR activist Dr. 
Robert Wesley of Irvine. Wesley and his wife, Shirin, dined alongside Turner 
and his fiancee, Jane Fonda (Turner bought the princess of fitness an opal and 
diamond engagement ring last week). Afterward, Wesley presented the chairman of 
Turner Broadcasting System with a handsome plaque embellished with an 
Eisenhower silver dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who did plenty of kissing and hand-holding during dinner, dug into 
their broiled salmon dinner with gusto but declined dessert -- ice cream and 
fudge cake. "They told me they never eat dessert," said Wesley, a cardiologist. 
Fonda dressed sedately for the affair in basic black with pearls. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Dr. Lawrence Probes, a member of PSR's board of directors; 
William Morning, executive director of International Physicians for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War; and Dr. Martin Coleman, a member of the PSR's 
steering committee. Proceeds from the banquet will be used to support a yearly 
educational conference for Orange County high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy about Costner: Emerald Bay's Deeann and Al Baldwin were among the more 
than 1,000 guests living it up with actor Kevin Costner at the Los Angeles 
party following the premiere last week of his new movie, "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
After a screening at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Theaters, the Baldwins 
joined party-goers in a cavernous tent that showcased scenes from the film on 
its walls. "It was amazing," Deeann said. "When we walked in, the walls were 
covered with herds of buffalo. Then, a few minutes later, they were covered 
were scenes from inside a tepee. Wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Deeann, special events coordinator for the Angels of the Arts -- the elite, 
all-women support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center -- said the 
party wasn't unlike Orange County bashes. "It was bigger, of course. But, just 
like here, everybody ate, then got up and left." 
</P>
<P>
But not before they schmoozed with Costner. "Gorgeous," Deeann said. "I didn't 
want the movie to end."

'CYMBELINE' IS WORTH THE TRIP; 
</P>
<P>
THE SAN DIEGO REP'S PRODUCTION OF THIS RARELY DONE SHAKESPEAREAN WORK IS 3 1/2 
HOURS WELL SPENT.

<P>
Shakespeare must have been in a generous mood when he wrote "Cymbeline." 
</P>
<P>
Generous about length -- the swift-paced production at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre's Lyceum Space runs 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Generous about story lines; he provides several where one would do. 
</P>
<P>
But, most important, generously gentle in spirit. The characters in "Cymbeline" 
err at least as much as those in the tragedies, but in this wistful, magical 
romance, nearly all elude the consequences of their mistakes. Even when a war 
is fought and won so that King Cymbeline of Great Britain can avoid paying 
tribute to Rome, in the end he decides to pay the tribute anyway in order to 
maintain good relations. 
</P>
<P>
All the villains, save the two who die, repent. Every still-standing fence is 
mended. Even those whose blood burned hottest learn to turn the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
As the wronged and once-rash Posthumus says upon freeing the shackled man who 
nearly cost him his life (as well as that of his wife), "Live and deal with 
others better." 
</P>
<P>
The length and complexity of "Cymbeline," one of Shakespeare's rarely done 
plays, might prove daunting to many companies. 
</P>
<P>
But not the San Diego Rep -- not even during this time of stressful financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
If the company hadn't previously proved itself deserving of community support 
during its 15 years of adventurous producing, this play would be a reminder of 
what the company stands for. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Douglas Jacobs' direction shows an ardent belief in the 
play's message of forgiveness, a belief in the healing power of theater and, 
ultimately, a stubborn belief in the integrity of Shakespeare's text. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo for not trimming the story. And bravo for the simple, bare set and 
staging that keep attention focused on what counts: the play and the excellent, 
visceral ensemble acting. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego newcomer Terres Unsoeld, a tiny, intense slip of a thing, shimmers 
like an incandescent light as Cymbeline's beautiful, vibrant and amazingly 
mature daughter, Imogene. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare stacks several plots against this heroine: a Lear-like father who 
rejects her for her constancy to her husband (whom Cymbeline banishes); an 
Othello-like husband, Posthumus, who is taunted by the Iago-like Iachimo into 
believing her false and so orders her death, and a Lady Macbeth-like 
stepmother, who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to wrest Cymbeline's 
inheritance from Imogene so that she can give it to her own son, the cloddish 
Clotan. 
</P>
<P>
Unsoeld's glowing performance shows that she is equal to it all -- and then 
some. In one jeweled moment, reminiscent of the crypt scene in "Romeo and 
Juliet," Imogene awakes next to what she believes is the corpse of her beloved 
husband. But, despite the intensity of her grief, Unsoeld never loses touch 
with the essential strength of her character. Unlike Juliet, she never sees 
suicide as an option. Imogene is a survivor with remarkable reserves of 
strength -- qualities Shakespeare rewards with the happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Imogene and her journey are at the center of the play, but the ensemble defines 
the world in which she operates persuasively and movingly. 
</P>
<P>
Old Globe associate artist and Shakespeare veteran Jonathan McMurtry -- here in 
his San Diego Rep debut -- anchors the play with quiet virtuosity as the angry, 
addled Cymbeline. Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds conveys the duplicity of the 
conniving stepmother with such charm that one almost admires her despite her 
evilness. Thom Murray is so brilliantly petulant and spoiled as Clotan that he 
makes amusing work of what could have become a one-note caricature. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Ross's deft performance as Iachimo renders the man more thoughtless 
than evil, so bent on winning a bet that he doesn't realize until too late that 
he is gambling with people's lives. Bruce McKenzie seems appropriately tortured 
as Posthumus, a wildly praised and generally beloved guy who nevertheless seems 
to be a bit of a lummox, flailing from one near-fatal mistake to another. 
</P>
<P>
The common problem shared by these disparate characters is their susceptibility 
and suggestibility. They jump to wrong conclusions. They have difficulty 
distinguishing truth from deceit. 
</P>
<P>
The play should come with warning labels: Things are not as they seem. Observe 
for yourself. Have faith in those you love. Give the benefit of the doubt to 
those who have earned your trust. 
</P>
<P>
Even Imogene, among the wisest of Shakespearean heroines, falls victim to 
duplicity when she jumps to conclusions after receiving a gift of poisoned 
medicine from her straight-arrow servant, Pisanio, who is stolidly and 
forcefully portrayed by Bill Dunnam. 
</P>
<P>
But what goes around comes around, a point made abundantly clear by Brenda 
Berry's set design -- a simple round stage with minimal props on which the 
action moves fluidly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of furniture, Berry gives us luscious, sumptuous lighting. The 
simplicity of the staging, accentuated by Jonathan Sacks' original 
medieval-style music and Catherine Meacham Hunt's unfussy medieval costumes, 
eases one into the world of the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
And what a rich and rewarding trip that is. Some may balk at a 3 1/2-hour 
commitment to an unfamiliar work. But those with patience and an affection for 
mental and spiritual adventure will find the journey well worth the wild and 
delightful treats that are in store.

<TEXT>
<P>
A tough, contemporary centerpiece stands amid delicate, traditional 
tissue-paper cutouts of the Virgin at the entrance to Centro Cultural de la 
Raza's current show. The large painted canvas in the center bears the same 
general shape as the holy images on either side, but the woman portrayed is 
different, profane, not sacred. She is a young Mexican or Chicana in jeans, 
T-shirt and tennis shoes, a machine gun strapped across her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Startling and poignant, the presence of the young woman announces that times 
have changed, that the face of innocence must now wear a weapon of war, that 
the defense of values and beliefs now calls for tough, even violent response. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "La Vecindad/The Neighborhood" (through Dec. 9), abounds with 
disarming and touching images, collaboratively produced by a group of 17 women 
from the San Diego-Tijuana region who call themselves Las Comadres. Like the 
annual "Border Realities" shows staged by the Border Art Workshop/Taller de 
Arte Fronterizo at the Centro, the current exhibit slices through the layers of 
political, personal, social and historical realities that define the region 
around the U.S.-Mexico border. "La Vecindad" feels ambitious, yet personal; its 
messages are often crudely expressed, but they are nearly always provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Injustices, both personal and historical, private and public, occur too 
frequently in the "neighborhood" that Las Comadres call their home. The 
inequities began when the native Indian and Mexican populations were pushed 
aside in the name of Anglo-European conquest and greed, and they continue 
through today in equally punishing forms. An accordion-fold book in the show 
recounts the history of the situation in a brief, mythic poem, describing how 
"Silence" invaded and overtook the native "Songmakers." 
</P>
<P>
A second accordion-fold work, this one mounted on the wall, gives glimpses of 
the current confrontations between Anglo and Mexican populations. Irregularly 
shaped windows cut out of black paper reveal photographs of people holding 
torches and signs defending the rights of American citizens, as opposed to 
those of illegal aliens. Another wedge-shaped image shows what appears to be a 
migrant worker speaking to a potential employer through his truck window. A 
newspaper box in the foreground acts as caption to the image with its 
identifying label, "USA TODAY." 
</P>
<P>
A reading room with books and folders of border-related articles makes clear 
the educational intent of the show but knowledge and insight enter here as much 
through the eyes and ears as through the mind. Questions resonate throughout 
the show, both through potent imagery and in the form of words -- "Who is to 
say that robbing a people of its language is less violent than war?" 
</P>
<P>
Among the most powerful visual experiences in the show is that which occurs 
when standing before an installation that pairs a segment of chain-link fence 
with a painted folding screen. The fence has a rectangular opening, through 
which one can see the screen and one's face reflected on a mirror mounted on 
the screen. The image painted on the screen, a large pink lozenge shape 
surrounded by wavy tendrils and golden light, suggests female genitalia. 
</P>
<P>
The fence and the screen together create a metaphor for birth and transition; 
standing on one side of the fence, the viewer's image appears on the other. The 
impending danger for all who enter life -- and more to the point here, all who 
cross the border -- is symbolized by a saw blade that has already cut through 
the top of the screen and sits poised above the mirror, above the viewer's 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the banners, paintings, photographs, texts and videos included in 
"La Vecindad" have the concentrated energy of this installation, but most 
convey the sense of danger, fear, pride and determination that governs this 
border neighborhood of ours. An intense desire to teach and to inspire change 
-- toward a society of "joy without borders" -- acts as the glue that holds 
these 17 artists and writers together and that motivates them to engage in 
social activism of several varieties, from demonstrations to exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Las Comadres will present a performance, "Border Boda," on Saturday at 8 p.m. 
in the gallery, using part of the exhibit as a set. Members of the group 
include Kirsten Aaboe, Yareli Arizmendi, Carmela Castrejon, Frances Charteris, 
Eloise de Leon, Maria Erana, Laura Esparza, Emily Hicks, Berta Jottar, Maria 
Kristina, Aida Mancillas, Anna O'Cain, Graciela Ovejero, Ruth Wallen, Margie 
Waller, Rocio Weiss and Cindy Zimmerman.

KASHI, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young Uighur man glanced over his shoulder to be sure no one was listening, 
then spoke softly in broken English. 
</P>
<P>
"The Uighurs are not happy," he said. "The peasants, they got guns. They fought 
with the army. Many finished. The army -- 80 finished. The peasants -- 200 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
In the dusty bazaar streets of Kashi, also known as Kashgar, Uighur hatred of 
Chinese authorities runs deep. Many here believe that more than 100 died 
fighting Chinese troops last spring in the nearby town of Baren. 
</P>
<P>
Official Chinese media say 22 died in the April 5-6 clashes: six paramilitary 
police officers, one government official and 15 "counterrevolutionaries." 
Details of what really happened cannot be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was only the latest in centuries of conflict between Turkic 
minorities and ethnic Chinese in China's westernmost region of Xinjiang, a 
largely desert area that straddles the ancient Silk Road. But Islamic 
fundamentalism and the rise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Central Asia, two 
factors that apparently influenced the violence in Baren, now confront the 
Beijing government with radical new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are responding with stepped-up controls over religious life and 
systematic suppression of secessionist activities. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenheng, deputy director of Xinjiang's Religious Affairs Bureau in the 
regional capital of Urumqi, said in an interview that the Baren uprising was 
led by an underground organization called the East Turkestan Islamic Party. It 
was supported by fundamentalist imams running illegal religious schools, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to establish an Islamic Republic of East Turkestan," Wang said. 
"Their slogan is they want to fight a holy war. Some of them were trained in 
privately run religious schools. So we say they're using the cloak of religion. 
But actually they are destroying unity between nationalities and promoting 
secessionism." 
</P>
<P>
The Muslims of Xinjiang are linked racially, linguistically, religiously and 
culturally to the peoples of Soviet Central Asia and Turkey. If the 
predominantly Muslim republics of the Soviet Union someday become independent, 
they could exert a strong attraction in places like Kashi, the key center of 
Uighur culture, which lies only about 100 miles from the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
Kashi, an oasis town of mud-brick buildings and colorful bazaars, still retains 
an almost biblical atmosphere. Donkey carts and vendors jam the narrow streets. 
Tea stalls offer fresh-baked, flat Middle Eastern bread and mutton kebabs. A 
sprawling Sunday bazaar draws more than 30,000 people every week to a 
multi-acre site at the edge of town. The minarets of 108 mosques rise above the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 years, Xinjiang has repeatedly been incorporated into the Chinese 
empire during strong dynasties, only to break loose again. Uighurs ruled much 
of Central Asia from the 8th to the 12th centuries. The Kashi region and parts 
of what is now Soviet Central Asia were subsequently ruled by the Mongols, by 
the empire of Tamerlane and by the Moguls. 
</P>
<P>
The Qing Dynasty re-established Chinese control in the 1700s but faced a major 
Muslim rebellion in the northwest part of its empire from 1862 to 1873. 
</P>
<P>
Uighur, Kazakh and Mongol rebels took control of the Kashi region and declared 
an independent Eastern Turkestan Republic in January, 1945. Communist 
authorities in Beijing reasserted Chinese control after 1949. Since then, they 
have arranged a mass migration of ethnic Chinese from the main part of China 
aimed both at developing the region's resources and ensuring that it can never 
again break away. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese in Xinjiang live largely separate lives. Minorities need fluency in 
Chinese to get good jobs, while Chinese seldom learn Uighur. Intermarriage is 
rare. Continuing social divisions and the long centuries of conflict ensure 
widespread resentment of Chinese authority. 
</P>
<P>
Anger is fanned by Chinese policies ranging from controls over religion to 
recently tightened family planning requirements. Minorities, previously exempt 
from population controls, now are officially limited to two children per couple 
in the cities and three or four in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang functions like any other Chinese province, with power in the hands of 
officials selected by Beijing. Its formal name, however, is the Xinjiang Uighur 
Autonomous Region. This is in recognition of the Uighurs' standing as the 
largest single ethnic group in Xinjiang; they constitute about 45% of the 
region's 14 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Adding other minorities, including Kazakh, Kirghiz, Uzbek, Tatar and Hui, about 
60% of the region's population is Muslim. After four decades of population 
transfers, ethnic Chinese make up about 36% of the population, up from 6% in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1960s, Turkic minorities could move quite freely across the 
Sino-Soviet border. But then relations between Moscow and Beijing turned cold. 
Many families were left with relatives on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, and especially in the past two or three years, 
cross-border contacts have resumed. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back and forth has no other purpose, it's just to see our mothers, our 
little brothers," commented Ruzeshayufu, a Uighur man leaving the town of 
Yining by bus to cross the nearby Soviet border and travel onward to visit his 
younger brother in Tashkent. "We are very happy. It's like being born again, 
that's how happy we are." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-border travel, although restricted to family reunions and trade, 
inevitably spreads knowledge of political and religious developments in the 
Soviet Union. Pilgrimages to Mecca, once banned, are now made by about 1,000 
Xinjiang Muslims every year. Growing numbers of Pakistani traders, who travel 
by land over the Kunjirap Pass, also bring new influences. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East and ethnic movements in the Soviet 
Union are having reverberations in Xinjiang, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, some Xinjiang people go to Mecca on pilgrimages, and some 
foreigners come to Xinjiang," Wang said. "Through this kind of contact, 
different sects and viewpoints invisibly spread into Xinjiang. We view this as 
normal and unavoidable. . . . There has been influence from some of these 
international tides of thinking. But as for our country, and Xinjiang, we are 
handling it according to our constitution and laws." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, that means a system of rigid controls. 
</P>
<P>
China's constitution, while guaranteeing freedom of religion, also guarantees 
what is called "freedom not to believe in religion" and grants dictatorial 
power to the Communist Party. Authorities try to ensure that all religious 
activity comes under government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is not as bad as it was during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, 
when many mosques in Xinjiang were shut down or destroyed. Throughout the 
1980s, mosques gradually reopened, and people are no longer afraid to worship. 
But this liberalizing trend has now ended. 
</P>
<P>
New restrictions published recently in the official Xinjiang Daily establish a 
system of government-run testing of religious leaders. All religious leaders 
must either hold diplomas from government-controlled religious institutions, or 
be tested and receive certification of their "political performance, 
ideological awareness and scriptural proficiency." This testing must be done by 
"patriotic religious organizations" run by government religious affairs 
departments at the county level or higher. 
</P>
<P>
No one can become a "religious professional" without obtaining a license from 
one of these government-controlled "patriotic religious organizations," 
according to the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious leaders must . . . support the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, 
support the socialist system, love the People's Republic of China, safeguard 
national unification and solidarity of nationalities and oppose national 
separatism," the regulations say. 
</P>
<P>
They must "promote simple wedding and funeral ceremonies, reform outmoded 
customs (and) foster new habits." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules also bar Muslim religious leaders, known as imams, from training 
successors outside of government-run institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious professionals . . . shall not operate schools or classes to teach 
religious scriptures or train volunteers; and they shall not . . . assume the 
responsibility of training religious apprentices or instill religious concepts 
into young people under 18," the regulations state. 
</P>
<P>
Private religious schools were formally banned two years ago, Wang said. But 
enforcement was uneven, and until the outbreak of fighting in Baren, many such 
schools continued to exist, he said, some functioning openly and others in 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
The events in Baren "showed that the imams who run these private schools are 
very reactionary," Wang said. "After the Baren incident, we were even more 
clear that this policy is correct: Privately run religious schools must be shut 
down." 
</P>
<P>
The key institution in Xinjiang for training a new generation of imams is a 
five-year Islamic high school in Urumqi that has about 160 students, Wang said. 
"This is to train relatively highly qualified Islamic religious leaders," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Government-run schools, however, cannot possibly train enough successors for 
all the mosques in Xinjiang, which Wang said now number 17,100. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Wang said, imams have been legally permitted to take on up to two 
or three youths for training as potential successors. Under the new 
regulations, this practice is banned. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules also bar imams from accepting visits or interviews with 
foreigners without special permission. Permission to visit Xinjiang to report 
on unofficial religious and ethnic views is only occasionally granted to 
Beijing-based correspondents. All formal interviews must be arranged through 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities try to use intimidation to limit casual contacts. A reporter 
visiting Kashi, Urumqi and Yining spotted plainclothes security agents 
following him. Agents twice used special cameras disguised as black briefcases. 
Every person who spoke of sensitive issues did so quietly and with a look of 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
Government authorities rejected a request for an interview at Kashi's Id Kah 
Mosque, the most important in all of Xinjiang, where about 7,000 worshipers 
attend Friday prayers every week. By luck, however, an earlier-than-scheduled 
arrival at the mosque found the head imam, Arunhan Aji, briefing a visiting 
Soviet trade delegation. Among the points he mentioned was that he and 106 
other religious leaders in Kashi receive their salaries from the government. 
</P>
<P>
This apparently was meant to illustrate the authorities' goodwill. Some of the 
faithful, however, view things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"They've bought our imams," a Kashi merchant complained bitterly. ". . . We 
can't trust them." 
</P>
<P>
Permission to build new mosques is rarely granted, said Wang, the religious 
affairs official. 
</P>
<P>
"Put simply, we have enough mosques," he said. "There's no need to build new 
ones. Building new ones would add to the economic burden of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
Wang said that imams "who want to increase their own power" sometimes object to 
government decisions against new mosques. Such imams, he said, are dealt with 
through "criticism and education." 
</P>
<P>
The vast web of administrative controls over religious and social life, 
combined with the overwhelming power of the Chinese army, would appear to 
ensure that any rebellion in Xinjiang can be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of the most alarmist statements come from the government itself. 
</P>
<P>
In Yining, a huge red-and-white billboard put up by the city government 
proclaims: "Ethnic separatism is the greatest danger facing Xinjiang." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, that is the very message that repressive controls and most Chinese 
propaganda seem aimed at hiding. 
</P>
<P>
So what does the future hold? 
</P>
<P>
The angry young man in Kashi summed it up this way, in his whispered, broken 
English: "Now, trouble. Tomorrow, trouble. And again tomorrow, trouble."

NICE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wars were fought, governments fell and new republics were formed in the rest of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
But almost continuously for 60 years, unruffled and undisturbed by these 
outside events, the Medecin family ruled Nice, the French tourist mecca and 
regional capital on the Cote d'Azur. 
</P>
<P>
Father Jean (The King) Medecin served 35 years as mayor. Handsome son Jacques 
Medecin took over where papa left off, logging 25 years at the helm of France's 
fifth-largest city (population 340,000) without ever facing a serious challenge 
at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The only break came after World War II, when Jean Medecin was banned from 
public office for two years because of his participation in the 
collaborationist Vichy government. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in French terms, a dynasty enduring enough to rival the Kennedys of 
Massachusetts and the Daleys of Chicago. Nice was in Medecin hands for nearly 
half the time it has been a permanent part of France, having been deeded to 
Napoleon III by the King of Sardinia in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the Medecin clan built a political machine that controlled the 
southeast corner of France and could deliver enough votes to change the outcome 
of close French presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being mayor of Nice, Jacques Medecin also was president of the 
regional council for the department, or state, of the Maritime Alps, and all 
nine of the region's representatives in the National Assembly were Medecin 
loyalists. The mayor had national political clout. 
</P>
<P>
That's why when Jacques Medecin suddenly packed up and fled the country 
recently, establishing himself in self-imposed exile in a resort town in 
Uruguay, the world of French politics was stunned. The ensuing attention has 
offered a rare peek inside the occult workings of French politics in general, 
not just in Medecin's stronghold in the Maritime Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Nice, townspeople were so accustomed to seeing a Medecin at City Hall 
that they didn't quite know how to react. 
</P>
<P>
"He is my god. I worship him. We owe him everything," said a despairing Alex 
Ricci, owner of a popular Italian restaurant across from the Palais de Justice 
in the sun-dappled, ocher-tinted old city of Nice. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Oltra, a burly political operative considered the mayor's right-hand man 
at City Hall, started wearing two wristwatches, one set to Nice time, the other 
four hours earlier, to the local time in Punta de Este, Uruguay, where Medecin 
has set up camp. To Oltra and others here, Nice still operates on two times -- 
French time and Medecin time. 
</P>
<P>
Theories differ over what chased Jacques Medecin from his sunny bastion on the 
Bay of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Oltra offered one: "Jacques Medecin is a fighter, but he was broken, crushed by 
the harassment he suffered. Some people kill themselves in similar 
circumstances. Jacques Medecin is not one of them. He left." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor did owe several million dollars in back taxes, the result of a tax 
department investigation that traced his holdings to Beverly Hills, Panama and 
the Caribbean. The tax bill forced Medecin, 62, and his American wife, Ilene 
Graham Medecin, 42, to give up their stunning hillside villa in Nice, complete 
with its own underground shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
French tax authorities were alerted to some of Medecin's foreign holdings by a 
former California business associate, Claudette Pezanas. She was angry that 
Medecin had not paid her $10,000 she claimed to be owed for her role in 
unsuccessful Medecin business ventures to sell a bus-stop video system and 
portable toilets to the city of Los Angeles. So, Pezanas went on a late-night 
French television program and answered questions about her dealings with the 
Nice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
After her 1985 appearance on the television program, "Droit de Reponse," 
Pezanas claimed that she and her family received numerous death threats. Three 
years later, she was found dead in the Jacuzzi of her Palm Springs home, an 
apparent drowning victim but, improbably, still wearing hair-curlers and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs Detective Mark Harvey noted in his police report: ". . . This 
agency is unable to establish whether the drowning death of the victim was a 
homicide or an accidental death." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Medecin left France, ostensibly on an official trip to Japan, a 
special magistrate in Grenoble was investigating charges that he had 
misappropriated tens of millions of francs in public funds through such dubious 
schemes as a multi-continent "talent hunt" for singers for the Nice Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the magistrate, the equivalent of a federal prosecutor in the 
United States, issued a warrant for Medecin's arrest on charges of "fiscal 
mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges, Medecin is accused of accepting kickbacks from large, 
government-funded construction projects in the region, including the new opera 
building and a convention center here, as well as skimming money from several 
dozen quasi-public "municipal associations" that received public funding. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most embarrassing episode along these lines, the magistrate is 
searching for 4.6 million francs (about $900,000) that was allocated to help 
restructure the municipal debt in Nice. 
</P>
<P>
The money was traced to an account held by a woman friend of the mayor, 
Elisabeth Arnulf, where records showed it had been withdrawn shortly before 
investigators got there. Asked about the disappearing money, Arnulf said she 
loaned it to a boyfriend in New York but forgot his name. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the moderate right political party Rally for the Republic, Medecin 
had also managed to frighten mainstream French political leaders by his recent 
flirtation with the extreme right-wing National Front party of Jean-Marie Le 
Pen. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its large community of pieds noirs, mostly conservative former 
French colonists from Algeria, and an equally conservative retiree community, 
the Nice region was already a stronghold for the National Front. Le Pen's 
opponents feared that an alliance with Medecin could give the right-wing party 
its first majority in a regional government. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling this fear, Medecin announced earlier this year that he agreed with 99% 
of the ideas espoused by the National Front, which has a strong anti-Arab, 
anti-immigrant platform and has been accused of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
After Le Pen was turned down by mayors all over France in his attempt to find a 
site for the National Front's annual convention last spring, Medecin not only 
offered Nice but also hosted a reception for Le Pen. 
</P>
<P>
Medecin's abrupt departure from his hometown left his broad-based political 
machine exposed at a time when corruption in French politics is a hot topic, 
and not just on the Mediterranean coast. 
</P>
<P>
In his controversial new book, "Impossible Inquiry," disgruntled Police 
Inspector Antoine Gaudino claims that the same kind of corruption that Medecin 
is alleged to have practiced -- accepting illegal kickbacks from government 
contracts and diverting funds from government-funded associations -- permeates 
the whole French political system, all the way to the Elysee Palace, the office 
of President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Gaudino claimed he was suspended from his job as inspector of finance in 
Marseilles after he uncovered a scheme of false billings on government 
contracts that steered money to many leading Socialist Party politicians in the 
south of France. One of the men named in the Gaudino investigation was a former 
Mitterrand campaign treasurer, Henri Nallet. 
</P>
<P>
Nallet was recently named minister of justice, the government position that 
oversees the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the United States, which requires strict accounting for political 
financing and gives investigative agencies the power to demand party financial 
records, French political funding has traditionally occurred in the dark, 
beyond public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the French National Assembly passed a law attempting to correct the 
problem by requiring more public disclosure of political contributions and 
allocating public money to help fund campaigns. For decades, however, the 
French electoral system has operated in a state of semiofficial corruption. 
Political parties needed money. The most common way to raise it was through 
kickbacks, often in the form of exorbitant consultant fees, on government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gaudino, the same crimes that Medecin is accused of committing are 
also practiced by most of the main French political parties, including the 
ruling Socialist Party. He theorizes that the only reason Medecin was picked 
out for special attention was because, with his potential alliance with the 
National Front, he posed a political threat to the other parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption exists everywhere," Gaudino said in a telephone interview, "but the 
courts are not always authorized to look into it. Today the Socialist Party is 
in power, and one discovers that the biggest scandals are found in the 
opposition. Right now, the courts are after Medecin. But they could just as 
easily go after the others. The same (municipal) associations that surround 
Monsieur Medecin can also be found around the Socialist Party in the 
(Marseilles) affair that I investigated." 
</P>
<P>
From his retreat in Punta del Este, Jacques Medecin sings a similar tune, 
claiming he is the victim of a "Socialist plot" against him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Nice, people await his return. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you when he will come back," said Jean Oltra. "Not tomorrow, but 
maybe after a year or two. But he will come back. Nice is his life, his soul, 
his family . . . . "

SAUDI WOMEN DRIVERS FACING ISLAMIC WRATH

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative backlash against a group of Saudi women who challenged Muslim 
tradition by driving their cars in public has swept two women's university 
campuses, prompting the suspension of at least six participating professors 
whose students labeled them "infidels." 
</P>
<P>
The women were suspended by royal decree from their teaching jobs at the 
women's section of King Saud University after hundreds of students signed 
petitions asserting they do not want to be taught by the women. Separate 
protest demonstrations broke out at the nearby College of Arts, university 
sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil over the women's driving demonstration, in which about 50 women 
challenged years of Saudi tradition last week by driving their automobiles in a 
convoy through Riyadh, reflects what some say is a growing sense of social 
unrest among conservative Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest has been sparked by Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait and the 
hundreds of thousands of foreign troops that have flooded into the normally 
secretive desert kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very upset about the troops. It's a situation they can't envisage 
or handle -- it's something that's out of control," said one professor familiar 
with the demonstrations. "They're not allowed to say anything about the troops, 
and we have a saying in Arabic -- it says you take it out on a low wall -- and 
the women are always the easiest targets." 
</P>
<P>
A Saudi official said the protests reflect Saudi Arabia's religious leadership 
attempting to assert its influence amid the crisis in the Persian Gulf, much as 
it did after the Iranian revolution in 1979 and later violent incidents at the 
Grand Mosque in Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
"The religious establishment is at it again," he said. "They always do this in 
times of crisis. They did it in '79. Now we have Saddam Hussein. Now is their 
chance to reassert themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, this shows our country is much more conservative than people think 
it is, and a lot of things simply aren't doable. People are always saying you 
can't change this culture, and maybe they're right." 
</P>
<P>
In demonstrations Sunday, women students at the College of Arts gathered in the 
courtyard and temporarily refused to go to class to protest the driving 
demonstration, according to university sources. 
</P>
<P>
At the women's section of King Saud University on Saturday, some students 
scrawled the words infidel and depraved woman on the doors of professors who 
had joined the driving protest. 
</P>
<P>
Students verbally challenged the participating professors, and hundreds signed 
petitions seeking their removal from teaching, according to sources at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"They accused them of being loose women who are out to shake the foundations of 
religion and society," said one of the professors at the university's women's 
section. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them who drove had been really elated by the whole experience. By the 
end of the day, she was tired and depressed. She said, 'Not a single student in 
all my classes seemed to understand. Not one of them approved.' " 
</P>
<P>
In their demonstration last Tuesday, about 50 women crowded into 15 cars and 
drove through the outskirts of Riyadh, violating decades of religious tradition 
that have prevented women in Saudi Arabia from driving. The women, who had 
learned to drive outside the country, were stopped and briefly detained by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that strictly prohibits any contact between unrelated men and 
women and does not allow women to go outside without veils, some women do not 
even ride alone in a car with their drivers but are accompanied by a female 
servant, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the ban against women driving say they are concerned not about 
driving itself but about what driving might lead to. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a woman with a flat tire might have to have contact with a man 
outside her family. Moreover, women drivers might be encouraged to go out of 
their homes unaccompanied by male relatives. Also, women cannot see to drive if 
they are wearing the full face veils demanded by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the demonstration, mostly married in their late 30s and early 40s 
and from prominent Saudi families, all were dressed conservatively in full abas 
(robes) and head scarves. 
</P>
<P>
They insisted that they were not trying to be like Western women but that, with 
a possible war on the horizon, they needed to be able to take care of their 
families, if necessary. One woman said her husband was a doctor already posted 
near the Saudi-Kuwait border, while she was left at home alone with two babies. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's religious police demanded that the women be incarcerated for at 
least a full day. However, a special committee of legal and religious scholars 
appointed under the sanction of King Fahd concluded, in what many officials 
regarded as a precedent-setting ruling, that the women violated no civil or 
religious laws. They were released after signing statements pledging not to 
repeat the activity. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a government-imposed blackout in the Saudi media on the driving 
demonstration, most news to Saudi citizens has come either through word of 
mouth or through the mosques, many of whose leaders during Friday prayers 
strongly condemned the demonstration as "un-Islamic." 
</P>
<P>
At university campuses, students said they heard that the women who drove were 
wearing shorts. Some said they heard the women had burned their abas. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been misunderstood. It's not just driving the car. All these people are 
saying that we want freedom to break up the moral fabric of society. People 
don't understand," said one of the professors suspended for participating in 
the driving demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to some of my students. I explained to them exactly what we were 
about, that this is a crisis, a war, that our men will be going to the front, 
and that like anywhere in this situation, women will play their role," she 
said. "Some of the students calmed down. Some of them agreed. A lot didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Explained another professor in the women's section: "These women (drivers) are 
calling for equality. These women are calling for women's liberation. They're 
imitating the West. And all these words are dirty words. The girls say, you 
have to leave your affairs in the hands of God." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats and government officials here say the demonstration and the 
subsequent turmoil reflect Saudi Arabia's attempt to come to grips with a 
crisis that is surrounding it on all sides and now, with the presence of 
foreign troops, growing from the inside as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time of social ferment, and people are asking tough questions about 
what they want their society to look like," said one. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials were forced to take action because of fears of what a 
wider conservative backlash could mean to the coalition of troops based in 
Saudi Arabia, some diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government is not willing to take strong action against them, the 
religious people might try to take matters into their own hands," said one 
Western diplomat. "Then you do have a serious situation on your hands, and how 
the government would respond to that is a big unanswered question."

MOJAVE DESERT MAKES AN IDEAL PARKING LOT; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE HUGE STORAGE AREA AT THE MARINE CORPS BASE NEAR BARSTOW HAS BEEN 
A KEY SUPPLY AND REPAIR FACILITY FOR 48 YEARS.

BARSTOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the biggest parking lot, storage area and garage on the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is a mystery to most of the thousands of motorists driving 
Interstate 15 who pass it each week. 
</P>
<P>
Parked in the open desert along the busy highway eight miles east of downtown 
Barstow are rows of M-60 tanks, trucks and a variety of military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
This is the U.S. Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, for 48 years a key 
supply and repair base for the Marines, especially important now during 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two Marine Corps logistics bases -- here and at Albany, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Aug. 10, when America reacted to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, thousands of 
tons of supplies have been shipped from here to Marines now stationed in Saudi 
Arabia," said Brig. Gen. John Brickley, 52, base commander. 
</P>
<P>
Track vehicles, rolling stock, forklifts, earth-moving equipment, gas masks, 
clothing and rations have been shipped from the base to Marines halfway around 
the world in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have 13 freighters stationed in strategic locations in the world, 
floating warehouses carrying battle-ready equipment and supplies that are set 
to sail on a moment's notice wherever a crisis occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Several floating warehouses were in the Mideast when Iraq invaded. The ships 
sailed to Saudi Arabia, where they were met and unloaded by Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when Marines in Desert Shield need parts, replacements, supplies -- 
everything to support ground forces except ammunition -- the two logistics 
bases will fill the orders. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since World War II, the logistics base here has been an economic mainstay 
for Barstow, population 20,000. The base is one of the area's largest employers 
with an annual payroll of $73.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Employed at the Marine base are 1,980 civilians, 650 Marines and a dozen Navy 
personnel. Members of the military are generally stationed here two or three 
years. The majority of civilians have worked here more than 20 years, some for 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines' largest building anywhere is the 1,050-foot-long repair facility 
-- longer than three football fields. It is 10 acres under one roof, where 800 
civilians and 155 Marines repair and maintain equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the $872,000 M-60 tanks are periodically serviced, as are the $600,000 
assault amphibious vehicles (AAVs); HMMWVs -- the high mobility multipurpose 
wheeled vehicles that replaced the jeep, and all other rolling stock of the 
Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Department of Defense railhead is located on the base. It serves 
both the Marine base and the Army's nearby Ft. Irwin. One building is a huge 
facility where vehicles are X-rayed to find cracks in armor plates. 
</P>
<P>
Two miles of old California 66 run through the heart of the 5,687-acre base 
where some of the streets, such as Iwo Jima and Tarawa, carry the names of 
famous World War II Marine battles. 
</P>
<P>
There are 3.4-million square feet under roof and 14-million square feet of open 
storage area at the base. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the extreme dry weather out here on the desert, the absence of rainfall, 
the low humidity, limited mold, rust and mildew to equipment stored outside 
that brought the Marines here in the first place," said Col. William Sahno, 51, 
director of the Base Materiel Division. 
</P>
<P>
"Outdoor cost of storage, obviously, is minimal and saves the taxpayer money. 
The only problem we have with outdoor storage is an occasional sandstorm. 
Availability of air, rail and interstate highways for transporting equipment 
and supplies is another reason for the Marines' presence here."

LOW WATER PRESSURE HURT EFFORT IN APARTMENT BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: BURSTING PIPES -- NOT DISCONNECTED HYDRANTS -- ARE BLAMED. DAMAGE IN 
THOUSAND OAKS COMPLEX RISES TO $12 MILLION.

<P>
Fire officials investigating a Saturday blaze that destroyed 21 apartment 
buildings under construction in Thousand Oaks raised the damage estimate to $12 
million Sunday and said firefighters were hindered by low water pressure in the 
nine hydrants serving the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators said they had no evidence that any of the hydrants were 
disconnected, as officials had said during the blaze Saturday. Instead, they 
said some hydrants were rendered useless as bursting pipes in the burning 
buildings caused water pressure to drop dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
All units being built at The Knolls complex on Avenida de los Arboles had water 
connections, said Ventura County Fire Investigator Bill Hager. As the buildings 
collapsed, broken water pipes sent about 1,000 gallons of water a minute 
flowing down the streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hager said the investigation is continuing, but he speculated that officials on 
Saturday "jumped to a conclusion" that someone had disconnected the hydrants. 
</P>
<P>
All the hydrants had been inspected by the Ventura County Fire Department 
before construction began to make sure they were operational, said John Wade, 
Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, the city's director of utilities, said that the water system 
provided twice as much water as required by fire codes but that the hydrant 
system is designed to fight individual fires, not groups of buildings burning 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an inferno," Nelson said. He said city officials and the county Fire 
Department will meet to discuss whether changes are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said they were beset by other problems during the fire that 
destroyed 330 of the 544 apartments at the complex. High winds, low humidity 
and the close proximity of buildings, coupled with the fact that the complex 
was in "the most volatile stage of construction," contributed to the severity 
of the blaze, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a real dangerous, critical point of a construction job," he said, 
noting that exposed wood building frames did not have the tile roofs that might 
have slowed the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the buildings were only 12 feet apart, Wade said. Wind gusts were 
clocked at 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, gawkers climbed a nearby hill to gaze at the piles of rubble and 
watch the efforts of 86 firefighters. Clouds of smoke continued to billow 
through the area as bulldozers ripped down ruined buildings in search of 
smoldering embers. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was ignited about 3 p.m. Saturday by a plumber using a torch to 
solder a pipe, fire officials said. It destroyed 21 buildings and damaged 
another for a loss of about $10 million, Wade said. Another $2 million in 
construction equipment was destroyed. Wade said the loss is covered by 
insurance. The first damage estimates were placed at $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of work the developers are going to have to do before they start 
back into rebuilding," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Newport Beach-based Regis Homes Corp., the project's co-owner, 
declined to comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ventura headquarters of Interstate Plumbing Inc., which 
employed the plumber who accidentally started the fire, and at the Thousand 
Oaks offices of Lang Ranch Co., the project's co-owner and developer, could not 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 firefighters from throughout the area fought the blaze at its height. 
Units came from Ventura County, the city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, 
Oxnard, Camarillo State Hospital, Point Mugu and state forestry and fire 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"With the magnitude of destruction, we were fortunate to have only four 
injuries," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained by 9 p.m. Saturday, but buildings continued to smolder 
through the night.

Widespread cynicism and a sparse voter turnout marked Sunday's election for 
mayors and a legislature in the state of Mexico, the country's most populous 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The common message from voters and non-voters alike was distrust. Few of the 
dozens of people interviewed -- from the poor neighborhoods of Nezahualcoyotl 
to the well-to-do suburbs of Naucalpan -- said they believed that the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party would recognize opposition victories. 
</P>
<P>
The election was widely viewed as a test of the government's commitment to fair 
suffrage prior to the 1991 national elections for the federal Chamber of 
Deputies and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe they will respect the election, but if I don't vote I am 
giving away the election," said Elba Gonzalez, 50, a businesswoman who voted 
for the conservative National Action Party in Naucalpan. 
</P>
<P>
Homemaker Maria Cruz, 32, agreed: "I vote because I don't want them to think 
we're with them. I want them to see. But, no, I don't think they'll respect 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, which is also the country's wealthiest state, surrounds the capital and 
houses 30% of the nation's industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico was one of five states in which the government recognized the victory of 
leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the 1988 presidential election. However, 
many of those who voted for Cardenas believe that the 1988 election was stolen 
from him and either cast their ballots skeptically or stayed away from the 
polls Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has invested more than 
$92 million in public works projects in Mexico state over the last two years in 
order to win back support for the ruling party, called PRI. In the municipality 
of Chalco, a poor area where the government has installed electricity and 
waterworks for tens of thousands of homes, the program appeared to be paying 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Several voters interviewed there said they cast their ballots for Cardenas in 
1988 but would support the PRI this time. While they believed that the 
government has been installing services precisely because it fears the strength 
of opposition, they said they would vote PRI now to ensure that projects get 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
"The PRI has a program," said Jose Cruz, 46, a vendor in the Santa Cruz market. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI is expected to win the state capital of Toluca and most of the 121 
municipalities and 34 legislative seats. Only about 25 of the municipal races, 
including Naucalpan and Nezahualcoyotl, are considered truly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In Nezahualcoyotl, where the government has not spent as much money, support 
for Cardenas' Democratic Revolutionary Party still appeared to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't vote, they fill in the blank ballots for the PRI," said Jose 
Santiago, 31, a government bureaucrat who supports Cardenas. "The PRI is an old 
party stuck in fraud. The issues here are pavement and police. They promised 
pavement and didn't come through. And it's dangerous to go out at night because 
you don't know if you'll be held up by thieves or by the police." 
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of both Cardenas and the National Action Party complained that 
the PRI had distributed free tortillas, wash buckets and other goodies to try 
to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few early reports of election-day irregularities -- some stolen 
ballot boxes in Los Reyes La Pazand Naucalpan municipalities. Democratic 
Revolutionary Party officials said some of their supporters had been threatened 
in Naucalpan, but no acts of violence were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, voting appeared to take place in an orderly fashion on card tables, 
kitchen tables and car hoods along main streets. Opposition observers appeared 
to be present at all polling places. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI's candidate for municipal president of Naucalpan, Mario Ruiz de Chavez, 
expected a high voter turnout. "We are confident that will happen and that we 
will have given a lesson in civic citizenship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A random survey of balloting places, however, showed a low turnout of as little 
as 15% of registered voters in some cases and no more than 30% at the busiest 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Some people said they did not vote because they no longer believe in elections. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Garcia, 28, a mechanic from Naucalpan, said he could not vote because 
government officials who visited him at home recently took away his credential 
after he told them he planned to vote for the opposition. They promised him a 
new voter card, but it never arrived, he said.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and rival Boris N. Yeltsin, head of the 
Russian Federation, met for several hours at the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
One report said they discussed emergency measures to feed the Soviet people and 
reform the crumbling economy. It was their first substantive meeting since an 
attempt at reconciliation over economic reform broke down in late summer. The 
federation has instituted its own 500-day plan for converting to a market 
economy, conflicting with a more cautious plan adopted by Gorbachev.

Congressional leaders gave mixed reactions to the buildup of U.S. troops in 
Saudi Arabia. They agreed on one thing: President Bush needs congressional 
approval before going to war. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton said he will ask Roman Catholic 
bishops to sign a statement asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective 
conscientious objectors" against war in the gulf. He will press for a 
discussion of the gulf crisis at an annual meeting of bishops that opens today 
in Washington.

In Tokyo, Vice President Dan Quayle discussed a military resolution with U.N. 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but officials did not reveal the 
U.N. leader's response. Quayle will discuss the crisis with at least 11 world 
leaders in Tokyo for the enthronement of Emperor Akihito.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it would attend a proposed Arab summit if the agenda included the 
Palestinian question, and if it is consulted on the time and place. The Iraqi 
offer came in response to an appeal by Morocco's King Hassan II, who said such 
a meeting would be a "new and last chance" for a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein also said in a British television interview that 
he is ready for talks on security issues in the Middle East. Asked specifically 
if he is ready to leave Kuwait, he responded, "We are ready to enter into a 
deep dialogue. . . . " 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq tried to swap all its hostages for a nonaggression pledge from France and 
the Soviet Union but both rebuffed the approach, diplomats said.

They said French President Francois Mitterrand told Jordan's King Hussein last 
week that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected the offer at

Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton said he will ask Roman Catholic bishops to 
sign a statement asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective conscientious 
objectors" against war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbleton said he will press for a discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis at the 
four-day annual meeting of Catholic bishops that opens today in Washington, 
although it is not on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbleton told the Detroit News he will ask the bishops to sign a statement 
prepared by Pax Christi, the national peace organization of religious and lay 
people that he heads. 
</P>
<P>
The statement asks Catholic soldiers to "become selective conscientious 
objectors" and actively resist the U.S. government's offensive deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"War is a very important moral issue, and if the bishops speak out about 
anything, they ought to speak out about going to war," the longtime peace 
activist said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gumbleton's superior, Archbishop Adam J. Maida, said he will urge a more 
moderate approach, although he said the Bush Administration cannot justify war 
in the Middle East if it is a fight over oil.

Americans paid tribute to the dead of wars past in solemn Veterans Day 
ceremonies Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknowns and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
-- amid fears that the nation may be swept into a new war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vietnam memorial, Bob Horsch of Rahway, N.J., a veteran of Army service 
in Vietnam, said he believed it was "just a matter of time" until the United 
States was at war again. 
</P>
<P>
Horsch said he believed the military buildup in the Persian Gulf was justified 
by the need to protect American interests and those of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Reuben of Lapwai, Ida., a member of the Nez Perce tribe who also served 
in Vietnam, declined to say whether the buildup was a good idea, but also said 
he fears the country was headed for war. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid so, but I pray and hope we don't," Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the ceremonies, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, paid 
tribute to the American troops now serving in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
At Arlington National Cemetery, Cheney laid a wreath at the Tomb of the 
Unknowns and addressed a capacity crowd in the adjoining Vermont marble 
amphitheater, which seats 5,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have been deployed to the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia are probably 
the best-trained soldiers we have ever had," he said. "The nation and the world 
will be better for their service. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are concerned about peace must stay prepared for war," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies, held on traditional Veterans Day in advance of today's official 
national holiday, took place under bright, sunny skies, with a crisp wind 
whipping through the flag-draped amphitheater at Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vietnam memorial, an armed services color guard and a bagpiper playing 
"Abide With Me" accompanied military and patriotic groups who placed wreaths in 
front of the 58,000 names inscribed on the ebony-colored, granite wall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project announced the selection of two 
finalists in its competition for a design of the memorial, to be built 
alongside the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. The target date for its dedication is 
1992.

U.S. EDUCATION PRACTICES SEEN AS 'TYRANNICAL'

Traditional methods of training teachers, testing students and selecting 
textbooks are so flawed they may derail creative efforts to improve learning, a 
report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, used 
a mandated congressional report to criticize basic U.S. educational practices. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney called the practices "tyrannical machines," a phrase coined by 
philosopher William James to describe methods that become both 
counterproductive and resistant to change once established on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited the Scholastic Aptitude Test as "an almost classic example" of 
a "tyrannical machine." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also attacked school textbook selection committees that choose material 
without reading them, college education programs in which teachers spend little 
time studying what they eventually will teach and university systems that value 
research more than teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrannical machines dominate American education and have contributed to its 
failures," Cheney said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
"When there are alternative ways to become a teacher or to choose textbooks or 
to assess students . . . it is more difficult for outmoded and unsatisfactory 
methods to dominate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders applauded the report, saying: "We need a 
revolution in teaching and learning." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that the SAT tries to avoid testing what students have learned 
about subjects such as history and literature. 
</P>
<P>
She said that an alternative would be to expand the use of the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress, saying it was the sole assessment tool that 
is both nationally representative and comprehensive in calculating what 
America's students know and can do in various subject areas.

MAYORS CALL FOR MORE FEDERAL AID

Cities deserve more federal aid because they supply the labor and the tax 
revenue that keeps the nation going, some of the nation's urban mayors said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities are our nation's marketplaces, not only for business, but also for 
ideas," New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we choke off our cities by denying them the resources they need to function 
efficiently, the marketplaces will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins and a dozen other mayors spoke at a news conference to kick off a 
two-day conference on urban issues, such as combating drug abuse, improving 
education and paying for costly infrastructure such as bridges and roads. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said cities are not getting enough federal aid to 
support drug education. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mayors, most of them Democrats, said the federal government is 
neglecting urban areas. In 1980, federal funds made up 19.4% of New York City's 
budget. Now that share is 9.7%, Dinkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Dinkins announced a cut of 5,400 city jobs to close a $388-million 
budget gap.

Hundreds of volunteers turned out to help National Guard and Army Corps of 
Engineer troops Sunday in efforts to save downtown Mt. Vernon from the 
rain-swollen Skagit River. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a full flood fight," said Dave Brookings, Skagit County assistant 
flood control engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, many of the more than 500 residents displaced by near-record 
flooding near seven northwest Washington rivers were returning to their homes, 
and most dikes and levees in low-lying areas were holding. 
</P>
<P>
Three houses in an isolated resort town were lost, and officials said that 
damage to roads, bridges, houses and businesses from flooding Friday and 
Saturday would run into millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
High water, slides and washouts closed numerous roads and highways, including 
the Trans Canada Highway north of Hope, British Columbia, about 90 miles east 
of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day deluge was produced by what National Weather Service forecasters 
call the "Pineapple Express," a fall storm route from Hawaii to the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In Mt. Vernon, with a population of about 14,500, Brookings said that 400 to 
500 people helped to fill sandbags as the Skagit River crested at 35.2 feet, 
7.2 feet over flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
Sandbags were piled three to four feet atop a 34-foot revetment that protects 
the downtown area, Brookings said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all just flat farmland," he said. "After it gets over the levees, that 
water just keeps spreading." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, rain and snow Sunday were scattered from the Great Lakes into the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell over northern Maine during the early afternoon, and from 
south-central New York state across east-central New York state. Snow showers 
extended over southern and eastern Michigan. Rain was scattered over 
northeastern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
A winter weather advisory was posted into early today over New York's western 
Mohawk Valley and the western Adirondack Mountains. Wind gusts were expected to 
exceed 30 m.p.h. today and produce windchill factors below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Atop 6,200-foot Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, the highest mountain in the 
Northeast, the temperature was 5 degrees with winds gusting to nearly 115 
m.p.h. The windchill factor was 46 below zero.

Some were proud. Others, weary or bitter. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly all 750 wives and children of U.S. Marines deployed in the Persian 
Gulf appeared grateful Sunday for a day of relaxation and entertainment offered 
by a Newport Beach hotel and local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The wives, mostly married to enlisted men, dined from an elegant buffet and 
listened to a celebrity dance band in a ballroom decked out in yellow ribbons, 
carnations and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
In another room, their children danced with Hula-Hoops, talked to Santa Claus 
and Batman and sent Christmas cards and valentines to their fathers thousands 
of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Madeline Harville, 32, told Col. Paul Johnston, commanding 
officer of the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station who, at the request of Newport 
Marriott management, had invited the spouses of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, 
stationed in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and elsewhere in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Half the unit is deployed in the gulf and more are preparing to leave, Johnston 
said.

"This is the first support the wives in our squadron have had since (the 
deployment) in August," said Harville, whose husband, Top, a master sergeant, 
is in Bahrain. He has told her that morale is plummeting in the gulf for a 
variety of reasons, including discrepancies in living conditions for officers 
and enlisted men. 
</P>
<P>
Harville also said she sent a letter two weeks ago to the Pentagon asking for 
more support for spouses, but has not received an answer. "Wives need a whole 
lot more" moral support and information, she said. "We need to know we're going 
to be OK, what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Harville came to the free party with her two children, Jeffrey, 12, and Steven, 
5. 
</P>
<P>
The children ate hot dogs and mingled with volunteers dressed as a Ninja 
Turtle, Batman, Uncle Sam and the Statue of Liberty. Some played war with long 
balloons as swords. 
</P>
<P>
Others fashioned valentines out of lace and pipe cleaners. "I Love you Daddy. 
Love Rachel," said one decorated with wooden hearts. 
</P>
<P>
The party arrived on the heels of disappointing news for those such as Judi 
Burch of Irvine, who had expected her husband, Dave, to return home in a troop 
rotation in February. U.S. leaders announced last week that the still growing 
number of troops will not return until the crisis is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand they're doing a good job. I wish they'd come home. They're needed 
here too," Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
Her only child, Christopher, 9, has had occasional stress-related breathing 
problems since his father, an air traffic controller, left Aug. 18, she said. A 
pediatrician told her he will recover when he accepts the situation, Burch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher said his father used to take him snorkeling every night in the 
community pool. He misses his father and sends him his schoolwork and talks to 
him on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of him," he said as a peace sign was painted on his face. The boy 
also planned to send his father a photo of himself taken at the party as he sat 
on Santa's lap and asked for a pair of Roller Blades-style skates. 
</P>
<P>
Former Army Green Beret Gerry Rush, corporate travel director for the hotel, 
thought of the idea of the party and enlisted the volunteer services of 200 
hotel employees and several local businesses to make it happen. Rush, whose 
license plate carries a Vietnam ribbon and the motto "It was always right," 
said he felt it was his job "as an American" to help the families. 
</P>
<P>
He also wanted to help those who have been hurt financially by their husband's 
deployment. The event included sign-up for classes on job interviewing skills 
and door prizes. 
</P>
<P>
A Marine sergeant earns between $15,000 and $16,000 a year, and many 
moonlighted as clerks or security guards to make ends meet, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (wives) lost up to $1,500 a month, easy," Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
About half the families arrived on buses from the air stations at El Toro and 
Tustin. The hotel also paid about $800 to keep day-care centers open Sunday at 
the bases so that women with very young children could attend the brunch. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel hoisted a 20-by-16-foot yellow ribbon on its facade Sunday, a symbol 
that the troops are not forgotten. It will remain up until the end of the 
crisis, a workman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is pretty behind what they're doing," said hotel manager Tom 
Limberg. "No matter how you feel politically, their families are a few thousand 
miles away. It's nice to give them a happy day." 
</P>
<P>
Some wives, such as Lisa Soto of Irvine, said they were treating the deployment 
as any routine rotation. She said her husband, Capt. Alfred Soto, is a career 
military officer and is serving "somewhere near a place that begins with a D." 
</P>
<P>
She brought their 4-year-old twins, Amanda and Alicia, to the party. Each had 
hearts painted on her cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tough, right?" she asked. The two nodded pleasantly. "We're Marine Corps 
kids, right?" Four hearts bobbed up and down. "We're prepared. Right?" More 
nodding. 
</P>
<P>
"They're celebrities at school," the mother said.

A teen-age girl was fatally injured and her two companions were hurt when a 
driver suspected of being drunk crashed into the back of their car as they 
waited for a traffic light in Redondo Beach early Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Brady Grasinger, 15, of Rancho Palos Verdes was a passenger in a 
car stopped at 177th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard that was rear-ended shortly 
before 3 a.m. The driver and another passenger, both teen-agers from Rancho 
Palos Verdes, were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Grasinger was taken to South Bay Hospital, where she died about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Raul Sanchez Ramirez, 27, of Lawndale at the scene. He was 
booked at Redondo Beach jail on suspicion of felony drunk driving and held in 
lieu of $25,000 bail.

A pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries Sunday when their small 
plane ran out of gas and crash-landed in front of a secluded beachside club, 
where several startled members and a valet had to duck to avoid being hit. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's officials said the single-engine Cessna was en route to 
Fullerton Municipal Airport from a small airfield in San Diego County when the 
pilot made an emergency landing on Niguel Road near the Ritz-Carlton hotel 
about 2:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The four-seat plane was nearly destroyed by the impact, said Sheriff's Lt. Jay 
Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Beckmeyer, 46, his wife, Carol, 39, both of Visalia, and Brian Paulino, 23, 
of Inglewood were treated for minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tennis Club at Monarch Beach, club members and employees who had 
gathered for a tennis tournament said they heard the Cessna's sputtering engine 
and saw it flying toward them, barely missing trees. 
</P>
<P>
The plane landed in front of the club on Niguel Road, bounced once, and caught 
a wing in palm trees in the median, witnesses said. The trees sheared off the 
wing, and the plane spun around before it came to rest in the median.

<P>
COUNTY ISSUE AGRICULTURAL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group has started a drive to place a ballot measure before voters to 
stop development of agricultural land within Camarillo. Farmers say the measure 
is unfair because it dictates what they can do with their land. Should the 
remaining 1,600 acres of agricultural land located within the Camarillo city 
limits be preserved? 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia A. Schutt, Concerned citizen 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I do feel that the land should be preserved. I don't have the exact 
figures, but agricultural land in the Camarillo area is rated, and on a scale 
of one to 10 we're at about three. Which means we have some of the richest soil 
within the whole United States. This is fertile soil needed for food in the 
future. I really think that if we pave over or sell to business people, it will 
be gone forever. In regard to the farmers, I understand this is a very heated 
issue. However, most of the farmland in Camarillo is leased by the farmers and 
therefore isn't owned directly by the farmer, which I think is a fact that most 
citizens don't really know. As far as the farmers rights, I think that is an 
issue we have to look into to a greater extent as citizens. I don't think it is 
black and white. But once the land is destroyed we cannot regain it. Consider 
our eucalyptus trees. So many decisions were made to destroy them. These trees 
are monuments that can't be replaced. I think the fields provide tranquility in 
the midst of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Fred C. Ferro, Farmer 
</P>
<P>
 No. The land should not be preserved. It is a city and all the planning rules 
and regulations are forcing the development within the city and not allowing 
city-type improvements within agricultural areas. Besides they are just not 
compatible. Try spreading some chicken manure out there on a couple of hundred 
acres and see what local residents say. Also, there's the problem of theft. The 
city population can do an awful lot of damage to an agriculture situation, and 
by the same token the noise and the harvesting when you get a lot of people 
working can disrupt the people living in their homes. If the land is within the 
city limits, it should go with what the planning commission says and be 
developed for city use. If the city or the residents want it green, they should 
buy it. But everything that has gone on so far has been based on economics, and 
it hasn't worked out that way. That's the way it is in the United States, and 
it's a little hard to change now. 
</P>
<P>
Rex S. Laird, Ventura County Farm Bureau executive director 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if I can respond with a simple yes or no. Our board has not 
reviewed the ordinance. The concern that I have is that this appears, on the 
surface, to be a method by which you can circumvent the General Plan process. I 
do think it is inappropriate for land to be locked up without due process. This 
is an extremely complex issue and cannot be dealt with in simplistic terms. 
There are too many economic factors outside the jurisdiction and effect of the 
city of Camarillo that make it difficult for the city to be able to guarantee 
that a piece of property could remain economically viable. If the people want 
this to be a quasi park, then rather than an ordinance maybe they should be 
looking at an assessment district to purchase the land. Otherwise you have 
acquisition without just compensation. In other words, they are telling people 
we have decided that this is what is appropriate for your land and there is 
nothing you can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Torrence, Ventura County League of Homeowners president 
</P>
<P>
 Avery sincere yes. This land is probably one of the few places in the world 
where we have 40-foot topsoil, adequate water and one of the best climates for 
farming in the world. Agriculture is one of the main commodities in Ventura 
County and one of the largest income producers. It is far better to have farms 
growing food to eat than blacktop to walk on. I think the time has come for 
Camarillo and Ventura County to start looking for maintenance of what we have, 
instead of addition. I don't think development is what is needed. I've been out 
here for 16 years. It was a nice rural area with prosperous farmers. Now they 
say they no longer can farm efficiently. The developers have created that 
problem. They've taken away from me and my family and our grandchildren and for 
many, many generations to come the dire need of agricultural land for future 
generations. Incidentally, I did some research and found that the commercial 
buildings in Ventura County have a 25% vacancy factor. The development I 
wouldn't object to would be taking areas not farmable to develop affordable 
homes for people. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie H. Erickson, Ventura County supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 When agriculture land is within the city limits it is generally expected that 
at some point it will be developed, leaving the land outside the city limits to 
stay as agricultural land. That's the General Plan of the county, and that's 
the way the county has generally developed. In some cities like Ventura, they 
have a plan which keeps some of their farmland in a holding plan and allows 
development farther out, but still eventually it is expected that land will be 
developed. Whereas the land outside a city limit is generally expected to stay 
farmland for a long, long time. There are parts of the Oxnard plain which are 
very, very rich. It is probably unfortunate that the early settlers in Ventura 
County elected to begin their cities on some of the farmland. And when you look 
at the maps of the best farmland in the county, a lot of it underlies existing 
cities and the homes in which many of us live. I'd like very much to work with 
the people who are concerned with saving the farmland in Camarillo so that we 
can be effective in saving the best land in the county.

FUNDING IS KEY TO HOME'S RESTORATION

The winding wooden stairs lead to a dusty attic that is empty, except in 
Johanna Dudley Overby's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
When the 71-year-old Ventura native climbs to the third story of this 
19th-Century Victorian farmhouse she remembers the gowns of Southern belles, 
boxes of costumes and old dolls from her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best room . . . where we played our best games," Overby said. 
"There was trunk after trunk after trunk to explore." 
</P>
<P>
By next year, if a group of Ventura residents can finish raising money, 
Overby's attic and other rooms in the historic Dudley House will be filled with 
marble-top furniture and antiques, organizer Sheri Oelschlager said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dudley House, with its wraparound porch and double-door entrance, stands at 
Loma Vista Road and Ashwood Avenue in Ventura and housed five generations of 
farmers. For 86 years, the Dudleys farmed walnuts, and later lima beans, on 40 
acres until 1978, when commercial growth reduced their property to nine acres. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't afford to stay," said Overby, granddaughter of the house's 
designer and owner. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city and about 15 volunteers have been raising money to restore 
the house for tours. 
</P>
<P>
A state grant helped paint the exterior, wire the house for electricity and 
repair the staircase, but the inside walls need to be plastered before 
organizers can begin decorating, Oelschlager said. 
</P>
<P>
The group, San Buenaventura Heritage Inc., needs an additional $150,000 to 
complete the project, including landscaping the yard as it used to be. Several 
lemon trees that surround the house will remain, Oelschlager said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember mainly being outdoors, because we had so many trees to climb," 
Overby said. 
</P>
<P>
The group attends street fairs and sells rag dolls and pins to help raise money 
to restore the landmark, Oelschlager said, but most comes from donations. 
</P>
<P>
Calendars with old black-and-white photographs of the city will also be 
available in stores this week to help raise at least $2,500, she said. Donors 
can also sponsor rooms or projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to have had it done already," Oelschlager said. "I just 
want to see it keep going." KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

COMMENTS SOUGHT ON ROAD WIDENING

<TEXT>
<P>
State and federal highway engineers are inviting comments on a $1.8-million 
plan to widen a dangerous one-mile stretch of California 150 between Ojai and 
Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon Valley ranchers and environmentalists in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties have been fighting the improvement project for six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants it," said Duncan Abbott of Abbott Ranch, which was established 
along Rincon Creek in the 1870s. If the project is carried out, the ranch will 
lose 1.5 acres of farmland, its historic entrance, a water well and an old oak 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway 
Administration want to straighten the curving highway, replace two single-lane 
bridges built in 1927 with new ones twice as wide, and increase the recommended 
speed limit from 15 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
No fatal accidents have occurred in six years along the stretch, which is a 
mile east of U.S. 101, but officials said the number of nonfatal accidents is 
seven times higher than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents say widening the road will increase its use and raise the 
likelihood of fatalities. Other concerns include the loss of 5.16 acres of 
farmland altogether, the effect on a creek's wetland habitat, and removal of 90 
trees that are mostly old oak, walnut and sycamore. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the completed study will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday in 
Carpinteria City Hall. Caltrans staff members will be available at 5:30 p.m. to 
answer questions. THIA BELL

OFFICER'S ALLEGED ASSAILANT SLAIN IN SHOOTING OUTSIDE PACOIMA HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man who shot at a Los Angeles police officer outside a Pacoima house Sunday 
morning was killed when the officer returned fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer George Wright, an 18-year veteran, fired eight shots at a 29-year-old 
man hiding behind a fence after the man fired three times at Wright and his 
partner, said Lt. William Hall, head of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
officer involved shooting unit. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released pending notification of his relatives, 
died at the scene of the shooting from bullet wounds. He was shot in the head 
and knee, Hall said. Wright suffered minor injuries in the 7:30 a.m. shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 44, and his rookie partner, Mario Santana, 23, went to a house in the 
14200 block of Daventry Street to investigate a report of domestic violence. A 
woman at the tract home in a working-class neighborhood told police that the 
man, apparently a friend of the family, was causing a disturbance and refused 
to leave. Wright and Santana walked to the side of the house, where they saw 
the head and shoulders of a man behind a wooden back-yard fence. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers ordered the man to raise his hands above his head, but he 
raised only his left hand, police said. When Wright walked toward the fence, 
the man fired three shots from a .357 magnum; a fragment from one of the 
bullets hit Wright in the left eyelid, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright fired eight shots through the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene. Wright was treated at Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and released. Santana, who did not fire 
his weapon, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they heard several gunshots in quick succession and then ran 
into the street and saw the officers crouched in the driveway of the tract 
house. 
</P>
<P>
As many as seven people lived in the house, neighbors said. It was unclear how 
many people were home at the time of the shooting.

Photo, Rolling In the Money: More than 8,000 motorcyclists, including comedian 
Jay Leno, rode more than 100 circuitous miles Sunday from Glendale to Malibu to 
raise $825,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. Leno's Harley-Davidson, above

$7,500 from David Oakleaf of Long Beach. Jackson Browne, below left, plays a

lot at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu Canyon, below right, with gleaming chrome. The 
Love Ride 7, as it was billed, is said to be the largest motorcycle 
fund-raising event in the nation. Participants pledged a minimum of $40. The 
ride was sponsored by Harley-Davidson of Glendale and was the most successful 
one of its seven-year history. At times the line of motorcycles, escorted by 
the California Highway Patrol, stretched three miles. ROLANDO OTERO / Los

NEPHEW HELD IN SLAYING OVER $40 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A squabble over a $40 debt escalated into a fight that left an Antelope Valley 
man dead and the victim's nephew in custody on suspicion of murder, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said James H. Grissom, 24, shot and killed his uncle, Donnie Ray 
McKinley, 32, after the two argued and fought at Grissom's house in the 10100 
block of East Avenue S-14 in Lancaster late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Grissom was being held without bail at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department substation in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Bill Linnemeyer said the two men were arguing about a debt that 
McKinley, a resident of Llano, claimed Grissom owed him. The two scuffled and 
Grissom grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and shot his uncle once in the chest, 
according to Linnemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, answering a 911 call from a relative at the house, found 
McKinley lying in a hallway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene of the 
shooting.

GREEN BAY USES MAJIK TO BEAT THE SHELL GAME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER COACH LOSES FOR FIRST TIME AT COLISEUM AS PACKER 
QUARTERBACK THROWS TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders came home Sunday expecting a hot meal and a quick fix at the 
Coliseum, the way it has always been under Coach Art Shell. Instead, a 10-game 
home winning streak snapped like a toothpick, giving way to a two-game streak 
of another kind and some speculation concerning the course of Shell's ship. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers tiptoed in, blemishes and all, and departed with a 29-16 
victory before a crowd of 50,855. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of packs, the Raiders seem to be coming back to theirs in the 
AFC West, where only a last-second loss by Kansas City keeps the Raiders atop 
the division that seemed theirs for the taking only a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a few weeks ago, quarterback Jay Schroeder led the conference in 
passing, only to topple three pegs in last week's loss and no doubt a few more 
after Sunday's performance: 11 for 23, three interceptions, no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the Raider defense would have stuffed a team that dared bring 
to the game a rushing attack led by its quarterback's 170 yards in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Packers unwrapped a football cryogenics project named Michael 
Haddix and watched him more than double his seasonal output with 69 yards in 20 
carries. The Packer offense had the ball almost twice as long as the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the Raiders were a clean-hitting football machine that minded 
its manners and penalties. But 10 more penalties Sunday made it 21 flags in two 
consecutive losses. "We're going to have to evaluate the last two weeks," 
tailback Marcus Allen said. "Because we're going in the wrong direction. Art's 
said time and time again the good teams start winning games and step forward. 
We took a step backward last week and we took a step backward today. Everyone's 
really upset about it. I'm upset about it. We just can't let it happen 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders made some big plays, sacking Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski 
eight times, but to what end? No one made a sack when it counted. Majkowski 
bled the Raider secondary with a precision short passing game, and kept the 
over-eager Raider pass rush off balance with draw plays to Haddix. 
</P>
<P>
Haddix said it was clear the Raiders had their sights set on Majkowski, not 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you do that you're susceptible to some draws," Haddix said. "I think 
they knew that, but they really didn't expect our running game to do what it 
did today." 
</P>
<P>
The score was 16-16 at halftime, thanks to scoring runs of five and two yards 
by Marcus Allen on the Raiders' first two possessions. The first touchdown was 
set up by a 48-yard pass interference penalty, the second on an 87-yard kickoff 
return by Jamie Holland. 
</P>
<P>
But the Packers dominated the second half, using key third-down conversions and 
clock control while outscoring their opponent, 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay took the lead for good, 19-16, on a 23-yard field goal by Chris Jacke 
with 12:57 left in the third quarter. Jacke would kick five field goals in all, 
setting a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
For this one he could thank Schroeder, whose first pass of the second half was 
intercepted by linebacker Johnny Holland, who returned it 32 yards to the 
Raider nine. 
</P>
<P>
It was downhill for the Raiders' offense after that, unless you can appreciate 
the beauty of three-yard rushes and punts. Bo Jackson managed 25 yards in 10 
carries. The Raiders are 1-2 since he switched cleats. Allen finished with 17 
yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
The defense took its shots at Majkowski, but he kept shooting back. 
</P>
<P>
Late in a key third-quarter drive, Greg Townsend and Bob Golic combined on a 
seven-yard sack of Majkowski, leaving the Packers with third and 19 at their 
42. But the Raiders couldn't hold. On the next play, Majkowski extended the 
drive with a 29-yard pass to Perry Kemp to the Raiders' 27. The Raiders shoved 
the Packers back one yard on first down, but Majkowski shoved back on second 
when he tossed a 28-yard scoring pass to Kemp in the right corner of the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
That put the Packers ahead, 26-16, with 14:53 remaining. Majkowski had slipped 
away again. 
</P>
<P>
"It frustrates you a little," Golic said. "You stop them on the run on first 
downs, and he's able to drop off the ball for just enough to get the first 
down. You think you've got him hit, then he drops a 28-yarder in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had several chances to get back in the game, the biggest when 
Schroeder's third-down pass at the Green Bay 41 fell incomplete with 11:04 
left. The Raiders elected to punt from there, handing the ball back to the 
Packers, who would not turn the ball back to the Raiders until there was 3:19 
remaining and the game was out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
On the drive, which produced no points for Green Bay, Majkowski kept possession 
with key plays. On third and five at his 25, he passed eight yards to receiver 
Jeff Query. On third and four at his 39, Majkowski passed six yards to Clarence 
Weathers. On third and seven at the Raiders' 48, Majkowski scrambled nine yards 
for another first down. All the while the clock was ticking, and all the 
Raiders could do was watch. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders took a last gasp from their 12 with 3:19 to play, but Green Bay 
linebacker Tim Harris sacked Schroeder on first and second down. On third down, 
a Schroeder pass intended for someone was intercepted by cornerback Jerry 
Holmes, who returned it 24 yards to the Raider four, setting up Jacke's fifth 
field goal with 17 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, Sunday's loss was a team effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't play well," Shell said. "The whole football team. It was our 
worst game of the year. No one in that room could say they did well. I did a 
bad coaching job, I didn't get them ready to play. That's my job to do and I 
didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Not even at home. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Backup quarterback Steve Beuerlein was inactive for the seventh consecutive 
week after receiving a two-game roster exemption to start the season. Asked why 
Beuerlein hasn't been activated, Raiders' Coach Art Shell responded, "He's 
always been activated. He's just de-activated on game day." . . . The Packers' 
Don Majkowski completed 16 of 26 passes for 195 yards with two touchdowns and 
one interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder was sacked five times. He had been sacked 12 times in eight 
previous games. "You don't play the position and not expect pressure," 
Schroeder said. "That's part of what I do." . . . Defensive end Greg Townsend 
had another big game, recording eight solo tackles and 2 1/2 sacks to bring his 
season sack total to 9 1/2. . . . Scott Davis had three sacks and five tackles, 
Bob Golic was credited with 1 1/2 sacks and Howie Long recorded one. . . . The 
Raiders were held to 53 rushing yards. . . . Sunday's roster card listed Green 
Bay's coach as Andy Intente. It's Lindy Infante, of course. Infante was told of 
the mistake afterward. "They'll know our name now," he snapped.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOTRE DAME IS NO. 1 IN THESE RANKINGS, TOO

Just who is Bill Studwell, anyway, and who put him up to this? 
</P>
<P>
Studwell, a librarian at Northern Illinois, recently spent more than a month 
listening to recordings of college fight songs and watching football games, 
then went public with his rankings. 
</P>
<P>
From a pool of more than 30 songs -- graded for music quality, lyrics and 
overall tone -- Studwell chose "Cheer, Cheer For Old Notre Dame" No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Add fight songs: Studwell ranked Michigan's "The Victors" second, Wisconsin's 
"On Wisconsin" third and Yale's "Down the Field" fourth. Navy's "Anchors 
Aweigh" and Maine's "Stein Song" tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Studwell resisted a personal bias in placing "Anchors Aweigh" so far down the 
list. A loyal Navy fan, he told the Associated Press: " 'Anchors Aweigh' is not 
as great as others at killing the opposition. It has almost a waltz beat to it, 
like a destroyer going up and down the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first major league player to have his uniform number 
retired? 
</P>
<P>
No relation: In case you missed it: When tournament winner David Peoples 
finished with 264, good for $150,000 at the Kapalua Invitational Saturday, he 
came in 22 strokes, and $145,500, ahead of Peter Persons. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet, please: Former British tennis champion Andrew Castle said last week: "It 
was only a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The Lawn Tennis Assn. Disciplinary Committee said Castle's joke will cost him 
2,400 pounds, adding that his action "was in breach of the rules of the LTA and 
the LTA Code of Conduct." 
</P>
<P>
During the Prudential National championships at Telford, England, Castle 
carried a placard that read "No to the Poll Tax," in protest of a controversial 
levy on all adults that replaced the system under which home owners were 
assessed according to the size of their property. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager: AP's reports from newspapers interviewing friends of Pete 
Rose who have visited him in prison and come back with little to report 
continue to trickle in. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, restaurateur Jeff Ruby, who said he was the first non-family member 
to visit Rose at the federal prison in Marion, Ill., told the Dayton Daily 
News: " . . . if he doesn't get into the Hall of Fame, I fear that's his death 
sentence. I worry about him doing something to himself. I really do. Stranger 
things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
The people's choice: Coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators were 7-1 when voters 
went to the polls last Tuesday. Had he entered the governor's race, he might be 
facing a career decision. 
</P>
<P>
In Alachua County, which includes the Gainesville campus, elections supervisor 
Buddy Irby said Spurrier was the clear third-place finisher, adding: "My staff 
told me they saw several ballots go through with his name (written in)." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees, No. 4, in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: University of California broadcaster Joe Starkey, updating his 
listeners with six minutes to play in Cal's 28-3 victory over Oregon Saturday: 
"If you joined us late, the story of the game is the absence of Bill Musgrave, 
the Ducks' outstanding quarterback, who left the game in the second quarter 
with a shoulder injury. But don't think that's the story of the game, because 
when he left the Bears led, 21-3." TED BROCK

AILING BRUINS GOT WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: UPSET OF NO. 2 WASHINGTON PROVIDES A MUCH-NEEDED LIFT HEADING INTO 
RENEWAL OF USC RIVALRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's 25-22 upset of second-ranked Washington Saturday in Seattle was 
significant in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
It provided a struggling team with an emotional lift and might have a 
long-range effect on the football program. 
</P>
<P>
It was also one of the most astounding victories in UCLA history considering 
Washington's 21-point favoritism and the Huskies' previous domination of 
Pacific 10 Conference opponents this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by winning, the Bruins (5-5) have an opportunity to avert a second 
consecutive losing season if they beat USC Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There is some irony, however, to UCLA's status. Even if the Bruins beat the 
Trojans and finish with a 6-5 record, they probably won't be invited to a bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis said that his phone wasn't ringing 
repeatedly Sunday with calls from bowl representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a thing since we lost to Michigan (Sept. 22)," Dalis said. 
"The Peach Bowl was the last bowl to pay any attention to us. All the oral 
commitments have been made. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that you might slip into a bowl is if a bowl had an agreement 
with someone earlier and that team might not have a six-victory season and the 
bowl doesn't have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
A NCAA rule prohibits schools with losing records from playing in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is committed to the Peach Bowl Dec. 29 in Atlanta, reportedly against 
North Carolina State or Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana has a 5-3-1 record with games remaining against Illinois and Purdue. 
Last year, Indiana was apparently set to play in the Freedom Bowl, before 
losing to Illinois and Purdue and finishing with a 5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that conferences are as eager as some bowl representatives to 
place their teams in bowl games at the earliest possible date. 
</P>
<P>
For example, five Pac-10 teams are already in bowl games: Washington, Rose; 
USC, John Hancock; Oregon, Freedom; Arizona, Aloha, and California, Copper. 
</P>
<P>
Official invitations will not be presented until Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue wasn't thinking about a bowl game after the Bruins' 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in a position to save our year, bowl, or no bowl, " Donahue said. 
"We have an opportunity for a winning season in our big game with our 
cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's more to it than that. When you beat the No. 2 team in the country 
in their stadium, with the weather conditions (wind and light rain) it helps 
your program, your confidence and the players who have been struggling." 
</P>
<P>
To put UCLA's accomplishment in perspective, it ranks with a 7-6 victory over 
Stanford's Rose Bowl-bound "Vow Boys" in 1935; the 14-12 victory over Michigan 
State in the 1966 Rose Bowl; a 20-17 victory in 1972 over Nebraska, the 
defending national champion, and a 23-10 victory over Ohio State in the 1976 
Rose Bowl game after the Bruins lost to the Buckeyes, 41-20, during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game with USC will be unusual in that a Rose Bowl invitation will 
not be on the line for either team. That was the situation in 1986 and 1980 
(when both teams were on probation). Previously, the Rose Bowl bid was a prize 
for at least one team, or one team had already clinched a Rose Bowl berth, in 
every year since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's defense, which has been maligned at times this season, held Washington 
to 283 total yards, 139 yards below its season average. UCLA defensive 
coordinator Bob Field said the team had four goals: 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want (tailback) Greg Lewis to rush for 100 yards (he got 50). No. 2 
was not to allow them to break any run for more than 20 yards (they didn't). 
No. 3 was not to let them catch any pass for over 25 yards (which they did) and 
make (quarterback) Mark Brunell beat us with his arm, and not his feet. (He 
completed only 10 of 34 passes). We wanted to make him one dimensional, not 
two. We just played our base defense, simple and sound."

DOLPHIN DEFENSE SACKS JETS IN 17-3 VICTORY;

The Miami Dolphins' defense continues to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins limited the New York Jets to 154 yards and extended their winning 
streak to six games Sunday with a 17-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (8-1), who are off to their best start since 1984, have not given 
up a touchdown in four consecutive games and have not yielded a rushing 
touchdown in 24 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Miami sacked Ken O'Brien five times -- increasing the Dolphins' league-leading 
total to 35 -- and intercepted two of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense makes one big play after another," said Dolphin Coach Don Shula, 
whose team is tied with Buffalo for first place in the AFC East. "Those five 
sacks kept the Jets from moving." 
</P>
<P>
The score was 3-3 after a first half that was played in 25 m.p.h winds. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the first series of the third quarter, a towering punt by Miami's 
Reggie Roby hit New York's James Hasty and was recovered by Greg Baty at the 
Jet six. 
</P>
<P>
One play later, Dan Marino connected with Tony Paige on a four-yard touchdown 
pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Dolphin kicker Pete Stoyanovich missed a 53-yard 
field-goal attempt, his first miss in 14 tries dating back to last year. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Tim McKyer intercepted a pass by O'Brien and returned it 15 
yards to the Jet 34, losing the ball as he stepped out of bounds. The ball 
stayed in bounds and Johnny Hector of the Jets fell on it. 
</P>
<P>
The officials first gave the ball to the Dolphins, then replay official Bill 
Swanson reversed that call and gave the ball to the Jets (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
However, after another huddle on the field, the ball was awarded to the 
Dolphins when referee Dick Hantak said "an inadvertent whistle" had stopped the 
play when McKyer went out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," McKyer said. "I might have stepped out. I heard a 
whistle. When I saw all the huddling, I didn't know what the deal was." 
</P>
<P>
Six plays later, Marc Logan scored on a one-yard run to make the score 17-3 
with 12:47 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Miami's two touchdown drives covered 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to think you can capitalize when you get the opportunity and not make 
mistakes yourself," Shula said. "We managed to do that, but I never felt safe. 
We were never comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Marino completed 21 of 36 passes for 192 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Stradford had seven receptions for 53 yards and also gained 46 yards in 
eight carries for the Dolphins. Sammie Smith gained 70 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien completed 12 of 25 passes for 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Al Toon of the Jets caught three passes for 40 yards, the 72nd consecutive game 
in which he has caught at least one pass. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphin receiver Mark Clayton had one reception for 11 yards, extending his 
streak to 61 games.

CHARGERS DROP BRONCOS INTO LAST PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: SAN DIEGO, LIMITING DENVER'S OFFENSE TO 211 YARDS, GETS ITS THIRD VICTORY 
IN A ROW.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers, a team on the upswing, defeated the Denver Broncos, a 
team on the downswing, 19-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have now won three consecutive games and four out of five. The 
Chargers hadn't won three in a row since the strike year of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the strike season, not since 1985 have the Chargers been .500 this 
late in the season. Go back to 1982, and that's the last time the Chargers were 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But things are turning upside down in the AFC West. The Broncos (3-6) are left 
for playoff dead, while the Chargers (5-5) are in third place, behind the 
Raiders (6-3) and Chiefs (5-4), who both lost Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who were in the Super Bowl last season, are now in last place. 
</P>
<P>
"They might be playing as well as anyone right now," Denver Coach Dan Reeves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers went after Sunday's win in playoff fashion. They combined a potent 
running game with a defiant defense and stymied Denver's attempts to rally. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marion Butts, who entered the game as the NFL's leading rusher, 
wasn't supposed to play. He had a deep thigh bruise and the club considered 
keeping him out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers kept Rod Bernstine (hamstring) in civilian clothes, and started 
Ronnie Harmon. Harmon ran 10 times for 71 yards, and then came Butts. 
</P>
<P>
He ran 16 times for 114 yards, including a 45-yard run that set up a field goal 
that left the Broncos stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting out the first quarter made me hungry," Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' defense, meanwhile, was cracking down on the Broncos. They 
limited the Broncos to 211 yards in total offense, sacked John Elway three 
times, and intercepted two of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good football team," said Elway, who was coming off a toe injury and 
also had a strained arch. 
</P>
<P>
"The toe's numb, but it's the knife here," he said, while pointing to the 
middle of his chest, "that needs to come out." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers used four field goals from John Carney to build a 12-7 lead with 
3:11 to play in the third quarter, but then Denver put them to the test. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff following Carney's fourth field goal, Kevin Clark ran 75 
yards to the Chargers' 25-yard line. It was the longest return in Denver 
history since 1972, and it put the Broncos in position to push ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers' defense refused to budge, and on third and seven Elway 
surrendered to Burt Grossman's relentless pass rush. As Grossman leaped into 
the air, Elway tried to force a pass to wide receiver Michael Young in the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Gill Byrd, however, was there for the interception. It was Byrd's 
second of the day, and for the team's all-time leader in interceptions with 32, 
his seventh of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stupid play on my part," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's interception gave the Chargers possession at their own 20, and they went 
on an 80-yard march and scored on linebacker Gary Plummer's one-yard dive. 
Plummer, who lines up as blocking back in goal-line situations, has now scored 
twice for the Chargers this season. 
</P>
<P>
Carney's extra point gave the Chargers a 19-7 advantage, but the Broncos were 
not finished. 
</P>
<P>
After getting the ball on their own 12, they moved to the Chargers' one-yard 
line with a first and goal. 
</P>
<P>
But on first down, Bobby Humphrey was tackled for a two-yard loss, and on 
second down, tight end Chris Verhulst bobbled a pass from Elway as he went out 
of the end zone, thereby negating atouchdown. On third down, defensive tackle 
Lee Williams sacked Elway for a nine-yard loss, and on fourth and goal from the 
11, safety Vencie Glenn knocked down Elway's pass in the end zone.

STATISTICS MEAN LITTLE AS COLTS BEAT PATRIOTS;

AFC: INDIANAPOLIS GETS ONLY FIVE FIRST DOWNS AND 155 YARDS, BUT STILL HANDS NEW

<P>
Quarterback Jeff George completed only four of his first 22 passes and the 
Indianapolis Colts had only five first downs and 155 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dreadful performances like those usually portend defeat -- unless, of course, 
they come against New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
George salvaged the day by connecting with Bill Brooks on a 26-yard touchdown 
pass play with 2:05 left Sunday as the Colts beat the Patriots, 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody that takes consolation in a close loss is just fooling themselves," 
New England defensive end Brent Williams said. "People don't pay their money to 
see football. They pay their money to see winning football." 
</P>
<P>
Only 28,924 were in 60,794-seat Foxboro Stadium, where the Colts (3-6) ended a 
three-game losing streak and handed the Patriots (1-8) their seventh 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are off to their worst start since 1970, when they were 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a big win for the team," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said, "regardless of 
the way the game was perceived by outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
George, the top pick in last year's draft, completed six of 24 passes for 106 
yards. His last two completions were a 22-yarder to Albert Bentley and the 
touchdown to Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
George had a chance to put the Colts ahead on the series before Brooks scored. 
But with the ball at the New England eight, his passes to a wide-open Bentley 
fell incomplete on third and fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a valiant effort by our defense," Patriot Coach Rod Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
But on the Colts' next possession, George's pass to Bentley moved the ball to 
the New England 34. After Eric Dickerson ran eight yards, George found Brooks 
between defenders Ronnie Lippett and Fred Marion, giving the Colts their first 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"George looked off the safety and made a great throw," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots had a last chance with first down at the Indianapolis 44 with 1:01 
left. But Marc Wilson, who completed eight of 23 passes for 87 yards, threw two 
incompletions. Those were followed by consecutive sacks, and the Colts ran out 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots lost despite a season-high 175 rushing yards. Their previous high 
was 123 in a 16-14 victory over Indianapolis in the second game of the season.

HEYWARD CARRYING HIS WEIGHT AS SAINTS TRIM THE BUCCANEERS; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: MUCH-MALIGNED FORMER NO. 1 DRAFT PICK RUSHES FOR MORE THAN 100 YARDS FOR 
SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK IN NEW ORLEANS' 35-7 VICTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Heyward is beginning to look like the kind of running back the New 
Orleans Saints hoped he would be when they made him their first-round draft 
pick in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward, who has been in the doghouse for most of his three seasons with the 
Saints, turned in his second consecutive 100-yard rushing game Sunday, 
including a 47-yard touchdown run to lead the Saints to a 35-7 victory over the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same guy he was 2 1/2 years ago," Saint Coach Jim Mora said. "He's 
just getting more opportunities now, and he's making the most of them." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive victory for New Orleans (4-5) and the fourth 
consecutive loss for the Buccaneers (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Heyward, who has been as heavy as 290 pounds during his three seasons, has made 
more headlines in New Orleans with his weight problems than his production. In 
the first seven games of the season, Heyward carried 11 times for 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Heyward, down to 259 pounds, followed last week's 122-yard effort against 
the Cincinnati Bengals with 155 yards in 20 carries against the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in my third year, and I hadn't been very productive," said Heyward, who 
rushed for 183 yards in 49 carries in 1989. "Now, it's more a matter of being 
level-headed. I can't let it affect me." 
</P>
<P>
Heyward's 47-yard touchdown run was the longest run of the season for the 
Saints. Heyward tore through the grasp of Wayne Haddix at the line of 
scrimmage, stiff-armed Harry Hamilton, then knocked Ricky Reynolds backward 
into the end zone from the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown put New Orleans ahead to stay, 14-7. Heyward also scored on a 
two-yard plunge in the third quarter to make the score 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints also scored on a 26-yard touchdown pass play from Steve Walsh to 
Brett Perriman in the second quarter, and on four- and one-yard touchdown runs 
by Rueben Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed seven of 13 passes for 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes, who rushed for 115 yards last week, finished with 56 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chandler started at quarterback for the Buccaneers and led them on a 
15-play, 80-yard scoring drive on the game's first possession. Chandler capped 
the drive with a 12-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler completed seven of eight passes for 44 yards before suffering a 
concussion on a third-quarter sack. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde replaced Chandler and completed 11 of 19 passes for 110 yards. 
Testaverde fumbled his first snap on a sack by Pat Swilling, setting up 
Heyward's second touchdown.

CONNORS TALKS A GOOD GAME FROM BOOTH

Jimmy Connors was dueling with Miloslav Mecir in the broiling sun and Mecir was 
winning. Connors fidgeted with his shirt and, as he wiped his face on his 
wristband, someone shouted from the stands: 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Jimbo!" 
</P>
<P>
Connors stood motionless, then turned in the direction of the voice. "OK, where 
are we going?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last match Connors played in Southern California, in the 
semifinals of the 1989 Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian Wells, which if 
everything goes right, might be where the 38-year-old left-hander returns as a 
wild-card entry next March in what will be his 20th year on the professional 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Connors lost the only three matches he played in 1990, which was basically a 
total washout for the five-time U.S. Open champion. Tendons in his left wrist, 
injured in February, would not allow Connors to hit a ball without pain. And 
although he tried to avoid surgery, Connors needed a wrist operation last 
month, which he hopes will permit him to still be playing by the time he is 39 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
Connors, of course, expects to succeed. After a year on the sidelines and 
working for NBC, he has been busy sizing up the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly learned a lot about the players," Connors said. "I saw guys who 
had a lot of guts and I saw some who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of guys have my attitude," he said. "I don't know whether 
that's because I have a lot of confidence in my game or because I have none in 
theirs. But I do realize that when they say, 'experience counts,' that's bull. 
If you don't get to the ball, experience doesn't count. I still think I can get 
to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
He can also get to the bank. In February, Connors will play a four-city 
exhibition series, called, "The Fire Still Burns," to prepare for the ATP Tour. 
One of the stops is tentatively scheduled for the Forum. After Wimbledon, 
Connors will take time out to play TeamTennis. Some estimates of his two-year 
TeamTennis contract run as high as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy Cup: It's still more than three weeks away, but the Davis Cup final 
between the U.S. and Australia at St. Petersburg, Fla., has already reached 
Grand Slam proportions, at least as far as ill will and controversy are 
concerned. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennis Australia protested a four-day delay by the U.S. Tennis Assn. in 
announcing the playing surface, even though the ruling International Tennis 
Federation had already approved the delay. That the USTA would choose clay was 
not much of a secret anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Australians protested the clay for the court that was to be imported 
from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennis Australia protested to the ITF the starting times of the matches: 5 
p.m., EST, on Nov. 30 for two singles matches; 12:30 p.m., EST, the next day 
for the doubles match. The USTA scheduled the matches at those times because of 
television, which should not exactly surprise anyone. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the ITF rejected the appeal of Tennis Australia, which wanted the 
first day's matches played earlier. Agence France-Presse quoted Geoff Pollard, 
president of Tennis Australia, as saying that Philippe Chatrier, president of 
the International Tennis Federation, "must be dirty (angry) we beat France in 
the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Australian Captain Neale Fraser said the times are unfair because he intends to 
use Pat Cash in both the singles and doubles. If so, Cash could be playing 
until midnight the first day and returning to the court before noon the second

Name game: The six-year-old San Diego women's professional tournament, which 
used to be the Virginia Slims of San Diego and later was renamed for the Great 
American Bank, has a new name and a new venue for 1991 -- the Mazda tennis 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The $225,000 event, with a 28-player draw, will be held July 29-Aug. 4 at La 
Costa, with the winner receiving a new car. Steffi Graf has won the past two 
years.

His new line?: Appearing on the "Oprah Winfrey Show" last week, Andre Agassi 
said he is considering a second career away from the tennis court -- acting. 
"Acting is something I've always toyed around with," he said. "Part of what I 
do is more than just sport, it's entertainment. . . . It's fun to entertain." 
</P>
<P>
He won't Budge: Don Budge, 75, who in 1938 became the first man to win a Grand 
Slam, is recovering from eye surgery at his home in Dingman's Ferry, Pa. Budge 
had a cataract removed from his right eye. He knew he had to do something to 
correct his vision when he was in London this summer to watch Wimbledon and 
played a little tennis with friends. Budge had trouble getting his racket on 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'God, the people I am playing with are going to wonder how I ever 
won Wimbledon,' " Budge said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, he expects vision in his right eye to return to 20-20. "I've 
got to be patient," Budge said. "And, gosh, I feel great. At my age, I should 
have one foot in the grave, but I feel so good, I'm staying."

Shaping up: U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras, who credited his improved 
quickness and agility as ingredients in his rapid success, is a student of the 
training techniques of Henry Hines of Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
A former long jumper at USC, Hines is not a conditioning coach, but a quickness 
and agility specialist who began working on and off with Sampras 11 months ago. 
"His improvement was pretty dramatic, actually," said Hines, who also has 
worked with Michael Chang, Amy Frazier and Mary Joe Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had a lack of knowledge of movement before, but once he learned, he 
felt he could get to every ball. He really believed his game was complete."

How costly was John McEnroe's loss in his first match in the Paris Indoor 
tournament last week? McEnroe, who double-faulted on match point against Jakob 
Hlasek, said: "I guess you can say I choked." McEnroe refused to shake either 
Hlasek's hand or the chair umpire's hand afterward. During the match, McEnroe 
was one step away from defaulting after receiving two prior code violations, 
for slamming the ball and for throwing his racket. McEnroe's defeat ended his 
chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Finals in Frankfurt, Germany, 
because he needed a good showing in Paris to climb into the top eight. Instead, 
McEnroe fell two places to No. 13. McEnroe was probably a longshot for 
Frankfurt anyway: He needed to defeat Hlasek, Goran Ivanisevic, Stefan Edberg, 
Sergi Bruguera and Boris Becker to qualify. McEnroe seemed to indicate that his 
season has ended, which would mean he will not play in the $6-million Grand 
Slam Cup. "I was waiting for the last minute to know how I felt," McEnroe told 
the Associated Press. "Now I feel like I need a break. I don't feel at the top 
of my game."

They romped to a 110-90 victory, pulling Houston to .500 (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon scored 15 points in the first quarter and finished with 31 points and

<P>
ITSALLGREEKTOME SURVIVES FOUL CLAIM TO WIN HOLLYWOOD DERBY BY A HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few things come easy for Itsallgreektome, so there was no reason why Sunday's 
$200,000 Hollywood Derby should have been an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from 10th place, Itsallgreektome bounced off of Septieme Ciel twice 
shortly before the wire, finished first by a head and then survived a foul 
claim to earn the $110,000 purse before a crowd of 20,531. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome's owner, Jheri Redding, is appealing the outcome of the Del Mar 
Derby, an August race won by Tight Spot. The victory was given to 
Itsallgreektome by the track stewards but taken away by a California Horse 
Racing Board referee. Also on the 3-year-old charcoal-gray gelding's record are 
photo-finish losses in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park and the La Jolla 
Handicap at Del Mar, plus narrow victories in the Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows 
and the Spotlight Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
This is a horse who usually has his trainer, Wally Dollase, on the edge of his 
seat, and on Sunday, with about a quarter of a mile to go in the 1 1/8-mile 
grass race, Itsallgreektome stirred doubts in his jockey, Corey Nakatani, even 
though they were in high gear on the far outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning for home, I thought we might be too far back," Nakatani said. "But 
this horse has a tremendous finishing kick." 
</P>
<P>
In Excess was on the lead then, having passed Marquetry, who set the pace from 
the start. In Excess also weakened and Septieme Ciel, who had trouble getting 
through on the turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatani had his mount perfectly timed for the wire, but Septieme Ciel, making 
his first start in the United States, was hanging on stubbornly. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, riding Septieme Ciel because Laffit Pincay suffered a broken 
collarbone in a spill last Thursday, was whipping left-handed and he and his 
colt came over to bump with Itsallgreektome. The horses came off of each other, 
then bumped again shortly before the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux claimed foul, but the stewards allowed the finish to stand. "The 
first time we bumped, my horse changed his lead (foot)," Desormeaux said. "Then 
he got to trying to head off the other horse again. The second bump, he was 
intimidated and lost his drive." 
</P>
<P>
After watching the head-on replay angle, which the stewards used to help them 
with their decision, Desormeaux said: "I came out a certain extent. But my 
horse was jostled. His legs almost went out from underneath him at one point." 
</P>
<P>
While Nakatani explained the race from his viewpoint in the jockeys' room, 
Desormeaux went by and said: "That horse of yours is one game son of a gun." 
</P>
<P>
They were rivals for a few minutes with big money on the line Sunday, but 
usually these two jockeys are friends. Desormeaux's wife, Sonia, was the 
baby-sitter for Nakatani's daughter when Nakatani went back to ride 
Itsallgreektome in the Breeders' Cup Mile two weeks ago. Nakatani's wife, 
Michelle, is Dollase's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The other horse was getting hit left-handed and drifted out toward my horse," 
Nakatani said of the stretch run. "My horse just reacted. We bumped twice, and 
I had to grab my horse by the head to keep him off the other horse." 
</P>
<P>
Septieme Ciel, who won carrying 138 pounds in France in his last start, was at 
equal weights with Itsallgreektome, 122 pounds apiece. The 3-year-old son of 
Seattle Slew finished two lengths ahead of Anshan, another European invader, 
and it was another 1 3/4 lengths back to In Excess, with the late- running 
Silver Ending finishing fifth. Late money on In Excess made him the slight 
favorite and Itsallgreektome, timed in 1:46 3/5, a fifth of a second off the 
stakes record, wound up the second choice and paid $7.60 to win. 
</P>
<P>
"This proves that the horse is genuine," Dollase said. "I was worried about him 
coming back so soon after the Breeders' Cup, but he was touting me about a week 
after he got off the airplane. He was just bouncing around and feeling 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Dollase thought he got a bargain the day he was able to buy Itsallgreektome in 
Lexington, Ky., for $75,000. Had the Sovereign Dancer-Sans Supplement yearling 
been offered at one of Keeneland's high-profile sales there, Dollase estimates 
that he would have brought twice that price. Also, Dollase said, few people 
were aware that Itsallgreektome had the same dam as Big Stanley, another horse 
who liked to run. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse has a lot of courage, and he always fires," Dollase said. "He's 
always been a lot to handle. They told me when they broke him at Cardiff Stud 
that he was like a bucking horse. He'd jump around with all four feet off the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome's first five races were on dirt, and since being introduced to 
grass in the Spotlight at Hollywood Park last May, he's finished first four 
times and had three seconds and a third in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Derby was Itsallgreektome's third race in about six weeks and 
he's going to get a rest until next year. Dollase indicated that the people 
behind him need a rest, too. This is a horse who is as hard on his handlers as 
he is on himself. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Septieme Ciel is now the property of a syndicate that includes R.D. Hubbard and 
he will race as a 4-year-old for his new American trainer, Richard Mandella. 
"He ran a tremendous race," said Criquette Head, who saddled him for the last 
time on Sunday. "I just wish we could have run him in the Breeders' Cup 
(Mile)), because that's his best distance. Today he kept fighting and never 
quit.". . . Anshan, saddled by John Gosden, the former California trainer who 
now works in England, is staying in America and will be trained by Charlie 
Whittingham. On Sunday he was ridden by Chris McCarron, who failed for the 15th 
time in trying to win a Hollywood Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Park stewards have not heard from Pat Valenzuela in the week 
they've given him to explain another absence from riding last weekend. 
Valenzuela, who was suspended for 30 days after testing positive for cocaine 
late last year, has until today to report to the stewards. There were reports 
at Hollywood Park Sunday that Valenzuela's attorney may meet with the stewards 
today. . . . Hollywood has a holiday program scheduled today. . . . Alex Solis 
rode three winners Sunday while Gary Stevens and Jose Santos, battling for the 
national money title, were both blanked. Stevens gained about $21,000 on Santos 
with two second-place finishes and has a lead of about $786,000.

Chip Robinson needed a miracle in the Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego to 
win the GT Championship Series title. He didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Cochran needed to keep his Chevrolet Spice out of trouble long enough to 
let Al Unser Jr. get in the cockpit. It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
And Juan Manuel Fangio II needed to replace the engine on his Toyota Eagle 
after a disappointing Saturday qualifying session. 
</P>
<P>
Fangio, the namesake nephew of the five-time world champion, took his new 
engine and drove it to victory on the 1.62-mile course on the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was very good," the Argentine said after winning by 1 minute 1.29 
seconds over Jaguar's Davy Jones in the 87-lap race. Nissan's John Paul Jr. 
took third. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $50,000 to Fangio, who averaged 78.836 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Jones took second despite losing a turbo two hours before the race in practice. 
The pace cars had already started the field on its way when Paul finally roared 
out of the pits. He eventually took the lead on lap 39 and held it until lap 
61. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, the fastest qualifier with a track-record 94.828 m.p.h. Saturday, never 
had a chance to get in the car. Cochran, the second-fastest driver to Unser in 
Friday's practice sessions, started the race on the pole and was simply to put 
in some laps; he and Unser would change positions under the first yellow flag 
after 30 minutes, allowing Unser to drive the rest of the 1-hour 45-minute race 
without stopping for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Cochran ran in first place for 18 laps before Ruggero Melgrati, 
driving a slower Camel Lights car, ran him into the wall at Turn 5. In the 
pits, Unser shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just awfully sorry for the Spice team and for Jay," Unser said. "From what 
Jay said . . . there was nothing he could do. He was running conservatively and 
consistently." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cochran: "I feel sorry for Chris Pook (Del Mar Race Management president) 
and Al," he said. "The car was brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
Said Melgrati: "He probably tried to pass me on the left. It's neither one of 
our faults." 
</P>
<P>
To win the GT championship, Robinson needed to win the race and have leader 
Geoff Brabham finish out of the top 10. Robinson reached second place but 
finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham won $150,000 for winning the title, his third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
James Weaver was disqualified by IMSA and fined $5,000 for improper driver 
conduct. IMSA ruled he deliberately ran over sound-control equipment after 
being told to correct a noise problem on his Porsche.

INTO THE NIGHT: A BENEFIT BASH FOR 'GUERRILLA ARTIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Thursday night's party for Robbie Conal, the "guerrilla artist" 
whose portraits of the famous and infamous regularly adorn every vertical 
surface in L. A. His paintings with sly captions ("Contra Diction" with Oliver 
North, "False Profit" with Jim and Tammy Bakker) had moved from the streets 
into Conal's first gallery show at the Pasadena Center for the Arts, and the 
event, at the West Hollywood club Po Na Na Souk, was both a closing night for 
the show and a benefit for the nonprofit monthly magazine the New Art Examiner. 
Santa Monica gallery owner Robert Berman emceed the evening, which featured a 
raffle of some Conal art works and dancing to Brazilian pop music. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Everyone seemed to have an opinion on the reelection of North 
Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, who has taken on the stature of Public Enemy No. 1 
in the art world. Conal's portrait of the senator features his visage on an 
artist's pallet, with the hole position in the senator's forehead and captions 
like "Artificial Art Official." "I put it up (on posters) all over Washington, 
D. C., but I don't know if he's seen it," said Conal. "But my work is for 
regular people, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Lots of ponytails on the men and slinky black dresses on the women. 
Overalls are making a comeback -- worn by night crawlers who are just coming 
home at the hour when real farmers are getting up to feed the chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statements: Conal wore a bowling shirt with "Art" stitched over the 
pocket, while Joan Hugo, the new L. A. editor of the New Art Examiner, wore a 
brooch made of light-emitting diodes. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Mussels, quiche, duck sausage, and rumaki, served up by waiters wearing 
harem pants, big shaggy hair and a lot of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: The event was open to the public -- at least those members of 
the public with $30 to spare. Ten dollars bought a chance to win a framed and 
signed Conal poster. And $4 got a beer -- a relative bargain on the private 
club scene, where a glass of club soda can go for $6. 
</P>

Quoted: Conal's image of Jesse Helms was erected on a billboard at the corner 
of Santa Monica and La Cienega in West Hollywood, only to be taken down by the 
billboard company after a few days. After considerable protest from Conal and 
friends in the art community, it was put back up. "The experience with that 
billboard taught me never to do anything legal ever again," said Conal.

HOLLYWOOD IRISH HOIST A TOAST TO GENE KELLY

"So this is what a gathering of the Hollywood-Irish clan looks like," Pierce 
Brosnan said while performing emcee duties at Thursday night's American Ireland 
Fund salute to Gene Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the gathering at the Regent Beverly Wilshire drew the Hollywood-Irish 
contingent plus other ethnic combinations, including three or four generations 
of stars -- from John Travolta ("My mom's Irish and I grew up in an Irish 
neighborhood") to Charles Bronson ("Russian and Lithuanian") to Jimmy Stewart 
and Ruby Keeler, as well as behind-the-scenes industry types such as Lili and 
Richard Zanuck and Lew and Edie Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara and Marvin Davis, presumably having recuperated from their own recent 
extravaganza/fund-raiser for diabetes, were back on the circuit again, although 
Barbara vowed there would be no encore of the Carousel gala for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-quarters Irish, one-quarter French," honorary chairman Donald O'Connor 
said of his own heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, take out the part that I'm French. Nobody here would ever speak to 
me again." 
</P>
<P>
Padraic MacKernan, Irish ambassador to the United States, allowed that "it's 
amazing at a thing like this how many people have Irish connections, by family 
or by affection." 
</P>
<P>
The event, stressed everyone concerned, was apolitical. Three years ago, the 
American Ireland Fund was established to support Irish cultural heritage and 
philanthropic activities in Ireland and to encourage peace-seeking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
After all kinds of entertainment, including the McGing Irish Dancers (actually 
from Cincinnati) and the Young Dubliners rock group (Southern California), 
Kelly received a pair of dancing shoes hand-cut by Galway Irish Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
After the 3 1/2-hour dinner and program ended, restaurateur Jimmy Murphy 
continued the celebration with an Irish "hooley" at Jimmy's where he was 
serving plenty of Guinness.

Mr. Peaks speaks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
ABC's baffling, frustrating, exasperating, irritating, bewitching, teasing 
"Twin Peaks" finally made good on its promise to reveal the identity of Laura 
Palmer's killer Saturday. And yes, just as I thought: 
</P>
<P>
Laura was murdered by Bob, the evil alter ego of Laura's father, Leland Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, just as I expected: 
</P>
<P>
That multipersonality wacko Leland put on plastic gloves and, as Bob, attacked 
Laura's look-alike cousin, Madeleine, beating, hugging and kissing her, then 
slamming her against a wall with such force that she fell in a crumpled heap, 
whereupon he inserted a tiny letter of the alphabet under her fingernail as his 
wife lay on the floor nearby, apparently unconscious, while the ceiling fan 
spun and a Louis Armstrong record continued to rotate on the turntable. And, oh 
yes, the white horse. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I expected something a little less obvious. 
</P>
<P>
What's that? You're doubting Mr. Peaks? You're recalling that your "Twin Peaks" 
guru earlier wrote that the long-haired Bob was actually a hero who had tried 
to save Laura and was anguished by her death, that I insisted to my many 
disciples calling from across the nation that Sheriff Harry S. Truman was 
Laura's killer? 
</P>
<P>
And you didn't realize I was kidding then? That I was pulling everyone's leg, 
exploiting their childlike naivete, that I had this mystery in the bag from the 
start? Please, I'm not a college graduate for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
You actually think Mr. Peaks didn't know that Leland would look into a mirror 
Saturday and see himself as Bob? You think Mr. Peaks hadn't a clue that Special 
Agent Dale Cooper and Truman would accompany the Log Lady to the roadhouse, 
where the bald giant would reappear to Cooper in a vision and warn, "It is 
happening again," just before Leland/Bob began doing his number on Madeleine 
back at the Palmer home? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I had it figured. But I didn't let on out of consideration for 
executive producers David Lynch and Mark Frost, not wanting to blow their 
mystery, knowing that their ratings were bad enough as is. 
</P>
<P>
Withholding the truth took enormous self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
When a recent caller predicted that Laura's murderer would be revealed as Lynch 
himself ("It's perfect," he said. "The man who created her, destroyed her"), I 
feigned support for this baseless theory. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Peaks wanted desperately to point out that Bob spelled backward is boB, but 
held back. 
</P>
<P>
When viewers began calling in droves to note the obvious, that Catherine 
Martell had been appearing in drag as a mysterious Japanese businessman, I 
played along, pretending this was more than a minor red herring. What I really 
wanted to do was toss it off and inform these innocents that Ben Horne would 
confess to his daughter, Audrey, that he had slept with and was in love with 
Laura, that Bobby Briggs would discover an audio tape hidden in the heel of the 
boot of spitting, drooling Leo Johnson, that poor Harold Smith would hang 
himself, that U.S. Navy personnel would bounce balls on the floors of the Great 
Northern Hotel, that Madeleine's decision to return home to Missoula, Mont. 
(where Lynch was born, by the way), would trigger the Bob demon in Leland. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, naturally, had become clear to Mr. Peaks weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But not everything is clear. What I don't understand is this: Why all the 
obfuscation? 
</P>
<P>
Instead of telling Cooper, "There are owls in the roadhouse," why didn't the 
Log Lady just say to him: "Dale, boobbie, go to the roadhouse. The bald giant 
has some important scoop for you"? 
</P>
<P>
And if the bald giant is such a smartie, why didn't he come out with it instead 
of speaking in clouded riddles? This was an emergency, right? Why didn't he 
just tell Cooper: "Look, Dale, babes, granted Ben Horne's a major creep, but 
you've arrested the wrong guy. Better get over to the Palmer house fast because 
Leland is there knocking the stuffing out of little Madeleine"? 
</P>
<P>
Even better, why didn't the giant save valuable time by unloading on Cooper 
before he got to the roadhouse? The giant is such a prima donna that he needs a 
major production and can't just whisper into Cooper's ear? 
</P>
<P>
That would have been logical. But noooooo! The way Saturday night's program 
ended means that Cooper will probably take another two episodes to figure out 
that Leland is the Bob who murdered Laura, further extending a bloated 
storyline that even many of the most tolerant "Twin Peaks" devotees feel should 
have been resolved weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unless . . . unless . . . Bob didn't really do it. The giant is right: It's 
happening again. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Peaks has spoken.

MALASHOCK TAKES NEW DIRECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the choreography of its artistic director, Malashock Dance &amp; Company 
moves forward in gutsy, passionately felt leaps. With the debut of two dancers 
and the world premiere of a new work over the weekend, they continue to boldly 
go where no other San Diego-based company has gone in quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
In a bill titled "Flames to Names," Friday through Sunday at Horton Plaza's 
Lyceum Theatre, Malashock emphasized new directions while refusing to let his 
reach exceed his grasp. The moves -- both business and artistic -- are logical 
ones for this staunch 4-year-old company, but they're risky nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of business, the addition of seasoned dancers Greg Lane and Carol Mead 
signals that Malashock Dance &amp; Company is nearly ready to brave the New 
York jungle, or at least to expand their touring. Yet, at a time when most arts 
organizations are pulling back rather than expanding, this increased financial 
burden is also particularly daring. 
</P>
<P>
Artistically, Malashock continues to explore the dynamics of character and 
narrative introduced in his last premiere, "Stan's Retreat" (also on the bill 
here). This time, however, he's even more concerned with solo interludes and 
psychological narratives. 
</P>
<P>
Malashock, the pioneering "New Romanticist," swims as intently as ever against 
the anti-emotional tide of contemporary dance. The former Twyla Tharp dancer is 
also becoming increasingly theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunate Names," set to the Brazilian sounds of Uakti, begins with three 
set-piece solos. The first is danced by the energetic Loni Pallidino, dressed 
in a modest skirt and buttoned-up blouse. 
</P>
<P>
Initially demure, her steps become increasingly frenetic, until she partially 
unfastens her shirt, revealing a modest cotton bra -- and, with it, an inner 
self. 
</P>
<P>
Maj Xander, the most striking and expressive of Malashock's dancers, enters 
wearing a gossamer purple cocktail dress. Bold, even exhibitionistic, at first, 
she goes through a change that leaves her suddenly meek, discarding her silver 
heels as she flees the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Debi Toth, however, who partners Malashock competently later in the bill, 
doesn't fare as well as Pallidino and Xander. Her solo is a stereotypical 
screed, complete with screechy, distracting vocalizations, that she delivers 
while wearing a costume of quasi-dominatrix garb. 
</P>
<P>
New company members Carol Mead, formerly of the Martha Graham and Murray Louis 
dance companies, and Greg Lane, who danced for Bella Lewitsky, made their first 
appearance in "Unfortunate Names," cast as a harmonious couple burdened by 
Angst. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Malashock pays attention to all the details, choreographing every 
inch of his dancers' bodies and making sure the music and lighting enhance the 
moods he chooses to evoke. 
</P>
<P>
There's an obvious lineage from Malashock's earlier, more abstract, treatments 
of human relationships to the episodic narrative of "Unfortunate Names." Yet as 
much of a virtuoso as Malashock is when it comes to choreographing interplay, 
he's still finding his voice in creating solos, and in integrating those solos 
with the group scenes and the work as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunate Names" may not be as polished a dance as Malashock usually offers, 
but it does show that he continues to be willing to push his own aesthetic 
boundaries. Never content to return to styles and scenarios already mastered, 
Malashock wants to venture further into the realm of dance-theater, without 
losing the visceral appeal of his non-narrative works. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan's Retreat" (1990), a study in relationships inspired by Carson McCuller's 
novel "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," was as compelling this time out as in its 
debut, with Lane easily finding a place for himself in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
Xander and Toth reprised their portraits of two lonely women, while Lane and 
Pallidino appeared as a blissful pair of young lovers. Malashock himself played 
the outsider whose intrusion rends the idyll, sparking desire in Xander and 
Toth's women and tearing apart the youthful couple. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill was "Up in Flames" (1988), an electric suite to music by Jimi 
Hendrix that's much less narrative than either "Stan's Retreat" or "Unfortunate 
Names." Filled with steamy, dramatic couplings and signature Malashock 
upper-body gestures and athletic lunges and lifts, it remains as seductive as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Mead, a skilled technician, appeared in "Up in Flames" as well as "Unfortunate 
Names," and seems, like Lane, to be making a niche for herself within the 
ensemble. She and her fellow dancers will no doubt be ready, no matter what 
hurdles Malashock decides to scale next.

25 YEARS OF GIVING A HOOT ABOUT THE HORTONS;

TELEVISION: 'DAYS OF OUR LIVES' PRINCIPALS CREDIT EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT, FAMILY 
VALUES AND BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FOR THE SOAP'S LONGEVITY.

Jennifer married Lawrence to save Frankie Brady's life, but was raped when she 
rejected Lawrence's sexual advances. Meanwhile, when Jack tried to rescue 
Jennifer, Lawrence's thugs captured him. After finding a note in Patch's coat 
pocket, Bo and Carly realized Lawrence was behind Patch's death. Bo fought the 
sexual tension between him and Carly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rape, rescue, mysterious notes and sexual tension between just about everybody 
are the staples of NBC's soap opera "Days of Our Lives," which marked its 25th 
anniversary last Thursday after 6,382 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, cast and crew from the past quarter-century gathered for a 
gala celebration at the Regent Beverly Wilshire -- to reminisce, to watch 
outtakes, to slice through the trademark "sands of time" hourglass painted in 
frosting on the anniversary cake and to speculate about why "Days of Our Lives" 
is one of television's longest-running programs. 
</P>
<P>
Like a miniature Academy Awards ceremony, the event drew a throng of fans 
hoping to see their favorite stars. "I love 'Days of Our Lives,' " said Kris 
Martinez, 32, an Alpha Beta employee from Downey. "I came to help them 
celebrate, in my own way." 
</P>
<P>
The party also drew the chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, Brandon 
Tartikoff, who acknowledged that the soap's longevity made the anniversary a 
special event. "Somebody said, 'I'm surprised to see you here, you must have to 
go to so many of these,' " he said. "Yeah -- like I have so many shows that are 
25 years old. It's just 'The Tonight Show' and this." 
</P>
<P>
Created by Ted Corday, "Days of Our Lives," the Horton family's continuing saga 
in the mythical Salem, U.S.A., made its debut Nov. 8, 1965, with Bill Bell, a 
veteran of "As the World Turns" and "The Guiding Light," as head writer. When 
Corday passed away in 1966, his wife, Betty, took over as executive producer. 
Their son, Ken Corday, now serves as executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience is emotionally bound to the show," Ken Corday said. "They've 
lived with the Hortons and their children and grandchildren, and, as silly and 
cliched as it sounds, they are a part of their lives. They watch because they 
love the people, and they love the story." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who left the show after 10 years and went on to create "The Young and the 
Restless," said that it had been difficult to leave his "children," but he 
believes the show survived because of its characters. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have people involved with your characters -- they must either love 
them or hate them or fantasize with them. There are all sorts of levels of 
emotional involvement, but there must be some involvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald Carey, who has starred for 25 years as Dr. Tom Horton, said that the 
show lasted because "it started out emphasizing family values. That is the 
basic thing that has kept the soap opera alive. We have veered away from it now 
and then, but we always come back to it -- the simple, moral values." 
</P>
<P>
John Clarke, who has played Mickey Horton since the show's inception, cited the 
realness of the characters as the primary reason for the soap's endurance: 
"When you are in a nighttime show, people recognize you, but they don't come up 
and introduce themselves to you. With this show, they come up, grab you by the 
arm and say, 'Hey, Mickey, tell me what's going on?' and try to get you to 
spill the beans about what's going on with somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Reid, another 25-year veteran as matriarch Alice Horton, summed up the 
show's popularity this way: "There are awfully nice people on the show; they're 
very attractive. Beautiful sets, beautiful people. What more do you want from 
daytime?"

Qantas Cuts Jobs: Australia's international airline will slash jobs in a bid to 
remain competitive, chief executive John Ward said. It will cut 500 from its 
work force of 17,000 by March 1 and sell five Boeing 747 aircraft earlier than 
planned, bringing to nine the number to be sold in the next 18 months. The 
Labor government said it planned to sell 49% of the state-owned carrier and 
would let foreign investors own up to 35% of Qantas.

Suits Against Japanese Firm Allege Poisoning: Dual lawsuits were filed in state 
and federal court against Showa Denko K.K. of Japan on behalf of roughly 120 
people who allege that they or members of their family were poisoned by 
L-tryptophan, an amino acid that was banned in the United States last April. 
The multimillion-dollar lawsuits assert that Showa Denko manufactured 
L-tryptophan and put the amino acid through a purification process "without 
testing, research or knowledge as to what the effect would be in the human 
body." The suits assert that Showa Denko "knew the product was the cause of 
various medical conditions" resulting in injury. (Case Nos. 004685 and 90-6018, 
Filed Nov. 8, 1990)

Combining shameless puns with relevant statistics, Louis Rukeyser grins and 
winks his way into the homes of 10 million television viewers every Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, he has demystified the jargon and gyrations of the economy. His 
irreverent attitude toward the subject has made Wall Street Week one of the 
most popular half hours on public TV. 
</P>
<P>
A 20th anniversary program with some top guests will air Friday. A one-hour 
retrospective will follow next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rakish, white-haired Rukeyser, a dead-ringer for George Washington, is one 
of the most durable personalities on television, rivaling Mr. Rogers, Johnny 
Carson and Julia Child. 
</P>
<P>
He is known for painful fits of prose. Answering a viewer's letter on investing 
in a hairpiece manufacturer, he said, "If all your money seems to be hair today 
and gone tomorrow, we'll try to make it grow by giving you the bald facts on 
how to get your investments toupee." 
</P>
<P>
After a market slump, he considered changing the name of the show to Wall 
Street Wake. He often consoles viewers by telling them to remember that it's 
only their money, not their life. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers we all remember in high school and college were not the ones who 
put us to sleep," he said of the show's style. "I don't think any of us should 
apologize for not being dull." 
</P>
<P>
People magazine has dubbed Rukeyser the only sex symbol of the "dismal science" 
of economics. New York's Daily News identified him as the "economic guru of the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
"Outside of the Wall Street Journal, Rukeyser has been a pioneer in 
demonstrating the popular appeal of quality business journalism," said Los 
Angeles Times media critic Thomas Rosenstiel. 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser, 57, and three panelists -- money managers and financial analysts -- 
question a guest each week. The luminaries range from the chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to John Kenneth Galbraith. 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser doesn't make predictions -- although he says he's a long-term bull. 
And he constantly issues disclaimers on stock tips that guests offer on the 
show. Nonetheless, their recommendations often cause specific shares to jump 
the week after the show airs. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Acampora, head of Prudential-Bache Securities' technical analysis 
division, credits Rukeyser with launching business coverage on TV. 
</P>
<P>
The former foreign correspondent for ABC and the Baltimore Sun became the first 
economic commentator for a network -- ABC -- in 1968. He moonlighted on the PBS 
show for three years before leaving ABC, complaining about television coverage 
of economics. 
</P>
<P>
He still maintains that economics is the most poorly covered area of American 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing view is that the subject of economics is too dull and/or too 
complicated to hold an audience larger than the capacity of your average 
telephone booth," he said. "I think that's nonsense. I think there is a hunger 
in the American public for clear, believable, understandable, usable pocketbook 
information." 
</P>
<P>
Although he concedes that the economy is looking bleak right now, he's quick to 
remind everyone that he doesn't invest for short-term profit. 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser, who also writes a syndicated newspaper column, lectures and has 
written two books, is tough on his panelists and guests. He continually pleads 
with them to speak in English. 
</P>
<P>
"Jargon is a very convenient shield for people not entirely sure of what they 
are saying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He says he'll keep doing the show as long as it's fun, and as long as his 
audience wants him.

Accountant Admits Involvement in Loan Fraud: A certified public accountant 
pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to defraud the government in 
connection with a $9.5-million "straw loan" between CB Financial Corp. in 
Oklahoma and the now-defunct Orange County-based Consolidated Savings Bank. 
Phil G. Gilbert was an executive vice president of Consolidated Savings Bank 
when the loan was executed in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
To circumvent a lending limitation to a Texas partnership in which the thrift's 
sole shareholder had a financial interest, Consolidated transferred the money 
through C. B. Financial to the partnership, falsifying loan records to conceal 
the actual transfer from federal regulators. Gilbert faces a maximum sentence 
of five years and a fine of $250,000. The collapse of Consolidated is 
considered a top-priority investigation by federal authorities. (Case No. 
90-808. Plea Entered Nov. 6)

Dangerfield Sued Over Dog Story: Comedy actor-writer Harold Ramis sued comedian 
Rodney Dangerfield, accusing him of stealing an idea for a film about a dog 
named Rover Dangerfield "who looked and acted like Dangerfield." In the federal 
court suit seeking at least $1 million, Ramis claims that he conceived of Rover 
Dangerfield in 1986 and told Dangerfield about his idea of making a movie about 
the dog. 
</P>
<P>
The two men reached a contractual agreement whereby Ramis later received 
$350,000 from Dangerfield after writing a screenplay for the film. Dangerfield 
began production of the film last December, the suit said, but Ramis claims 
that Dangerfield has failed to pay the balance on money promised in the 
contract. (Case No. 90-6025. Filed Nov. 8, 1990)

JAPANESE ARE STARTING TO BUY SKI RESORTS IN UNITED STATES; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THEY PLAN TO BUILD GOLF COURSES ON THE TROPHY PROPERTIES THEY ARE 
ACQUIRING -- SO THERE WILL BE YEAR-ROUND BUSINESS. SOUTH LAKE TAHOE'S HEAVENLY 
VALLEY IS THE LATEST PURCHASE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After picking up seaside golf courses, Hollywood studios and New York 
skyscrapers, the Japanese have added ski resorts to their shopping list of 
American investments. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago they arrived on the California slopes, agreeing to buy Heavenly 
Valley, one of the state's choice ski areas. It is nestled amid the casinos and 
hotels of South Lake Tahoe. Sapporo-based Kamori Kanko Co. grabbed the 
20-square-mile resort, which is valued between $80 million and $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors already own such premier ski resorts as Breckenridge and 
Steamboat in the Colorado Rockies and Stratton in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese love skiing almost as much as golf, and their investments come at 
a time when U.S. resorts are striving to attract skiers from overseas to make 
up for meager growth in the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
While the Japanese have purchased only about a half dozen winter resorts, "any 
time you own a Heavenly Valley, a Breckenridge or a Steamboat, you have made 
yourself a major player in the ski market," said Charles R. Goeldner(, a 
marketing professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
Their deep pockets and strong yen have made them a formidable force in the 
industry, allowing them to outbid Americans for choice properties and to 
develop the winter resorts into year-round vacation spots. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to compete with the prices they are paying at this point," 
said Larry Jensen, director of business development at S-K-I Ltd., whose 
properties include Bear Mountain resort near Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
But investors from Tokyo are not expected to swamp the nation's approximately 
600 ski resorts with offers. Japanese acquisitions of ski resorts mirror their 
purchases of select, high-profile U.S. golf courses, such as Riviera in Los 
Angeles and Pebble Beach near Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for big names," said Walter Elander, vice president of 
Sno-engineering, a Littleton, N.H.-based resort planning firm. "It's just like 
the guy who wants to own his own baseball team. If he wants recognition, he 
wants the best. These Japanese entities want to be associated with the name." 
</P>
<P>
The names represent a lot of potential value for the two Japanese companies 
that have spent the most on U.S. resorts. Both Victoria Inc., which owns 
Breckenridge and Stratton, and Kamori Kanko Co., which owns Steamboat and is 
acquiring Heavenly Valley, have substantial interests in the Japanese sporting 
goods and leisure industries. 
</P>
<P>
"They could use the Breckenridge name for a line of consumer goods or ski 
apparel," said Jack Barthell, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of 
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., which tracks Japanese investment in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Besides getting valuable names, the Japanese gain a finite resource. Soaring 
land and development costs and tighter environmental regulations are likely to 
severely limit the number of new ski resorts. "As with any scarce resource, 
they will only become more valuable with time," Goeldner said. 
</P>
<P>
But ski resorts will take more time and investment than golf courses to yield 
substantial rewards, investment experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The returns are thin, and the question is where are the future buyers for it," 
said David A. Eisner, a managing partner in the real estate consulting group of 
Price Waterhouse. "We think this is going to be one of the few transactions 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very seasonal," Barthell said. "It goes great guns during the ski season 
-- if there is good snow. A lot of the Japanese will look to put golf courses 
in these areas." 
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese ski resorts are as busy in summer as in winter. Kamori Kanko's 
resort boasts a ski area, golf courses and an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that (Kamori Kanko) said that they wanted to improve is the 
summer product -- that definitely includes building golf courses," said Rod 
Hanna, 
</P>
<P>
spokesman for the Steamboat Ski &amp; Resort Corp. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the Japanese owners seem more concerned with winning over 
longtime residents and resort workers than building golf courses. The Japanese 
have kept American managers and, in the case of Kamori Kanko, has helped build 
affordable housing for employees. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some worrying because (Heavenly Valley) is now owned by someone who 
isn't local," said Duane Wallace, president of the South Lake Tahoe Chamber of 
Commerce. "We'd like to keep the local flavor. But I don't think you will be 
able to tell that this is a business owned by the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Like other resort-area officials, Wallace looks forward to more visitors from 
Japan. But visions of jumbo jets arriving with loads of Japanese skiers have 
yet to become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sports Stalker ski rental shop in Steamboat Springs, manager John 
Nicholson said only a handful of people have ever used the shop's Japanese 
rental forms. T-shirts that say "Ski Town USA" and "Steamboat" in Japanese are 
more popular. "We sell them to the Americans," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not trying to bring in busloads, carloads and planeloads of Japanese 
skiers," said Bob Roberts, executive director of the California Ski Industry 
Assn. "They have gone out of the way to downplay the Japanese connection." 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a market (for skiers visiting the United States) that presents a lot 
of promise and considerable obstacles in tapping," said Jim Felton, spokesman 
for Breckenridge Ski Corp., which counts Britain, Australia and Mexico as its 
top three foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
Felton said it is difficult to persuade the Japanese to visit a new vacation 
spot. U.S. ski resorts are about 20 years behind their Canadian counterparts in 
wooing Asian skiers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But "skiing in this country is languishing," he said. "It's foolish for anybody 
to exclude" the international market.

STATE CEO PAY GROWS FASTER THAN FIRMS' PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPENSATION: A STUDY FINDS THAT THE VALUE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES' SALARIES AND 
BENEFITS ROSE 9% IN 1989, WHILE THEIR FIRMS' PROFITS WERE UP ONLY 5.9%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When growth is the yardstick, being a big-time California chief executive is 
more profitable than being a big California corporation. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of management consultant Towers Perrin, which surveyed 
CEO compensation at the state's 100 biggest public companies. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that the median increase in CEO compensation was 9% last year, 
giving the CEOs median cash pay of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, net income of the companies studied rose just 5.9%. Worse yet, 
return on equity fell 2.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the relationship between pay and company results is weak," says 
Donald L. Lowman, a principal of Towers Perrin. "Executive pay in California, 
as in the country overall, is on a far faster track than corporate 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
By national standards, the California executives were not egregiously 
compensated. Towers Perrin said median compensation of chief executives of the 
top 100 U.S. industrial companies was up 9.2% last year. 
</P>
<P>
The California study, based on 1989 proxy statements, looked at pay, incentives 
and supplemental benefits of the top five executives at the companies analyzed, 
as well as for outside directors. 
</P>
<P>
Other results: 
</P>
<P>
* The natural resources and entertainment industries consistently paid their 
executives more than other industries. 
</P>
<P>
* The services and health-care sectors consistently paid less. 
</P>
<P>
* Restricted stock grants are the fastest growing long-term incentive device. 
</P>
<P>
* The median 1989 retainer paid to outside directors was $20,000. The median 
board meeting fee was $1,000.

ACTRESS EVE ARDEN DIES AT 82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Eve Arden, the wisecracking and thoroughly delightful English teacher 
of television's "Our Miss Brooks," died of heart failure today. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Arden, famous for her quick ripostes, died in Los Angeles at her Doheny Estates 
home at 2:30 a.m. with one of her daughters, Liza West, at her bedside, said 
her personal manager, Glenn Rose. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, blonde comedienne had a distinguished career in movies and on the 
stage, but she was best known for her years as Miss Brooks, including four on 
radio and four in television's early years. 
</P>
<P>
Arden began the series in 1947 and made the switch to television in 1952. She 
won an Emmy in 1953 for best female personality. 
</P>
<P>
Arden's character earned her a lifelong image as a schoolmarm and wisecrack 
artist, with her put-downs delivered in an expressionless twang. Countless 
motion pictures and stage appearances and two other television series failed to 
rid her of the Connie Brooks image.

A furniture truck stalled on a railroad track this morning and was struck by a 
northbound train, splitting the vehicle in two and scattering furniture and 
boxes along 50 yards of track. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
When they heard a train approaching, three workers on the truck ran down the 
tracks, trying to warn the engine crew, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran up to the bridge and flagged down the train," said the driver, Joseph 
Alexander. He said the train operator "hit the brake" but could not stop in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near Fairhaven and Grand avenues about 9 a.m., according 
to Santa Ana police.

Joseph Cicippio Jr., son of an American held hostage in Lebanon, died Sunday of 
a heart attack at age 35, hospital officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio was taken to North Penn Hospital early Sunday morning, a nursing 
supervisor said. He was pronounced dead at 6:29 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Family members refused to talk to reporters today and funeral arrangements were 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cicippio Sr. was taken hostage in Beirut on Sept. 12, 1986. His son 
became the third member of his family to die since he was taken into captivity. 
A sister, Rose Abell, 73, died of cancer months after his kidnaping. Abell's 
husband, Bill, 80, died last year of a heart attack.

A brush fire that erupted before dawn today in a Topanga Canyon clearing that 
teen-agers use as a hangout scorched 40 acres and shut down a canyon road but 
damaged no structures, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began about 3:50 a.m. near Old Topanga Canyon and Zuniga roads. By 7 
a.m., about 200 firefighters had the blaze encircled, Los Angeles County Fire 
Capt. Frank Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
One minor injury was reported to a firefighter working on an inmate crew. The 
fire's cause was not immediately pinpointed, but an illegal campfire was 
suspected.

The body's own defenses against disease can go awry and attack proteins that 
carry cholesterol through the body, triggering the dangerous buildup of 
artery-clogging deposits that causes heart attacks, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Hollander of Boston University said his latest research supports 
the idea, which he pioneered two decades ago, that hardening of the arteries is 
an autoimmune disease -- the body's misguided destruction of itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that our findings indicate that immune factors play a key role in 
the formation of the fibrous lesions that are the fundamental cause of heart 
attacks and strokes," Hollander said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander's theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as 
doctors try to identify the forces that cause the blood vessels to fill up with 
fatty deposits like rust-encrusted pipes. This process, which doctors call 
atherosclerosis, results in a heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally 
squeezes off the flow of blood entirely.

<P>
The Williamsburg, once Harry S. Truman's official presidential yacht, is 
rotting near a sewage plant on the Potomac River outside Washington and faces 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalized, 243-foot-long hulk is covered with broken glass and empty beer 
bottles, the Kansas City Star reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing but a rusting hulk," said Richard Lynn, a Kansas City, Kan., 
riverboat operator who researched the possibilities of restoring the craft. 
</P>
<P>
If no one takes the former beauty of black steel, teak trim and mirror-polished 
brass, it faces demolition in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the Williamsburg has had a variety of owners. It had a brief 
stint as a floating restaurant in New Jersey in 1969, and before that the 
National Science Foundation in Norfolk, Va., used it as a laboratory, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship became available about two weeks ago to anyone who could prove to the 
District of Columbia that it would be restored, said Kim Nielsen, chief of 
photography for the Smithsonian Institution's Freer and Sackler museums. 
</P>
<P>
"People have no conscience about destroying things of historic value," Nielsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen is trying to find a future for the yacht, and he envisions the Midwest 
as its brightest hope. Independence, Mo., to be more specific -- Truman's home. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea of moving the Williamsburg to the Midwest is hopeless, local 
leaders and entrepreneurs say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those cases where the powers that be have turned their backs on 
it," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen estimated that even though the ship would be donated, the restoration 
would cost about $7 million -- more if the ship is to ever sail again. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McGraw of Independence looked into bringing the yacht to Independence about 
four years ago. When he finally tracked it down, it was privately owned and 
scheduled to again become a floating restaurant in New Jersey. The city of 
Independence dropped its queries. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nielsen called McGraw two weeks ago to say the ship was available. 
</P>
<P>
But now, McGraw said, "I don't think the city's going to get involved in it. I 
don't know what the city of Independence would do with it."

GULF CRISIS: AN ITALIAN FREED BY IRAQ SAYS SOME CAPTIVES ARE 'GOING OUT OF

Some Western hostages in Iraq are "going out of their minds," drinking heavily 
and showing clinical signs of depression, a freed Italian journalist said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who've started to drink, others who no longer talk," 
said Roberto Fabiani of the Italian magazine L'Espresso. 
</P>
<P>
"(They) go from chair to chair in the hotels, and some are even beginning to 
show clinical signs. They're going out of their minds," Fabiani told reporters 
on arrival at Rome's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani, tired and unshaven, arrived in Rome via Athens from Amman, Jordan, 
with seven other Italians freed last week by Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
He was in Kuwait when Iraqi forces invaded on Aug. 2. He said he was put in a 
camp and transferred to Baghdad two days later. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the real odyssey began, the period in which we were considered hostages. 
There was no real violence. We were all treated very well, but it was a simple 
case of prison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is holding several thousand Westerners, including about 290 Italians. Some 
are at strategic installations as human shields to deter any attack by a 
U.S.-dominated multinational force that has gathered in Saudi Arabia and the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is bad and getting worse," Fabiani said. "There's too much 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a staunch supporter 
of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, said his nation would not be involved in a 
military strike against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was interviewed by Mayo, the weekly Cairo newspaper of his ruling 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not enter Iraq under any circumstances," said the Egyptian leader, who 
has dispatched more than 15,000 Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia to serve in the 
U.S.-led multinational force deployed to counter Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to do with Iraq, but to enter Kuwait as peacekeeping forces, 
we have no objections whatsoever," Mubarak said. "This is natural, although I 
hope this day will never come. I want everything to be achieved by peace."

A transport strike called to protest an Islamic law was paralyzing much of the 
country at the end of its first week today and presenting the new government of 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif its first crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bus drivers in Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab began the work 
stoppage Nov. 6, but it has gradually spread to other areas, and drivers of 
trucks, oil tankers, taxis and rickshaws have joined the protest. 
</P>
<P>
The strike caused chaos today in the southern port of Karachi, the country's 
largest city and chief financial center. Many schools, colleges, government 
offices, banks and private businesses were closed, and only private cars could 
be seen on the streets.

Boris N. Yeltsin, the outspoken president of the Russian Federation, today 
accused rival Mikhail S. Gorbachev of trying to pressure his republic into 
ceding some economic powers to the central government. 
</P>
<P>
"But we couldn't and will not go for that," Yeltsin told a legislative 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the two most powerful Soviet politicians and frequent 
critics of each other's policies, met in the Kremlin on Sunday for four hours 
of what were intended as peacemaking talks. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin came out with more criticism of Soviet authorities, especially over 
negotiations on a new treaty to group the 15 splintering Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
"They pressed us yesterday and earlier to first sign a union treaty and then 
resolve remaining issues, in the meantime transferring everything to the 
authority of the center," Yeltsin told the Russian Federation's constitutional 
commission. His remarks were carried by the independent Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin did not use Gorbachev's name, but the Soviet president appeared to be 
his target. In the end, an agreement was reached to resolve differences this 
year, before the treaty is signed, Yeltsin told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities and Russian authorities will form parallel groups to work on 
issues, Interfax said, including banking, property and the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation and most other republics are at odds with the central 
Soviet government over who should control what. The Russian Parliament has 
declared its laws take precedence over national legislation and has passed a 
plan for switching to a market economy in 500 days. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the prime minister of Russia said he told Soviet Prime Minister 
Nikolai Ryzhkov his republic wants to help strengthen the union, but also wants 
more powers itself.

Racal, Britain's leading defense and electronics firm, launched a plan today to 
sell off its telecommunications and security units and put its core businesses 
in a separate, management-owned unit. 
</P>
<P>
Racal Electronics PLC said that it will shed its 80% of Racal Telecom PLC and 
Chubb security units and that management will buy out its remaining activities. 
</P>
<P>
Racal said its shares in Racal Telecom will be distributed to Racal Electronics 
shareholders, while Racal Chubb Security Group also will be spun off, with 
shares distributed free to Racal shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
It said Racal management, led by Sir Ernest Harrison, proposes to buy out Racal 
Electronics' remaining activities. 
</P>
<P>
The combined value of Racal Electronics and Racal Telecom was $10 billion, and 
the stock spinoff and unit sales would be valued at about that amount.

Chrysler Corp. may deepen its relationship with Japanese car maker Mitsubishi 
now that talks between the nation's No. 3 car maker and Italy's Fiat Auto SpA 
have collapsed, Automotive News said today. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler and Mitsubishi are likely to increase joint product development and 
production in the United States and possibly the Far East after Chrysler's 
failed bid to strengthen its presence in Europe via Fiat, the weekly industry 
paper said in its Nov. 12 edition. 
</P>
<P>
The talks between Chrysler and Fiat collapsed Nov. 2, with both sides blaming 
poor global economic conditions for thwarting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, the only top U.S. car maker without a major presence overseas, has 
been looking for a way to enter Europe and break its dependence on the North 
American market.

General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary is planning to produce 10 models by 
1994 and possibly expand its current one-plant operation, a trade journal said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn Corp. sent three car models -- single- and twin-cam sedans and a sporty 
coupe model -- to showrooms Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Automotive News reported in today's editions that the company will add a 
luxury sedan and coupe, a coupe convertible, two station wagons and two 
two-door hatchbacks. At least two of those vehicles will be added in each of 
the next three model years, the publication said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn's $2-billion Spring Hill, Tenn., plant can produce up to 240,000 
vehicles annually. Automotive News said production there is scheduled to reach 
303,000 by the 1993 model year and 360,000 the following model year. 
</P>
<P>
That will probably force Saturn to build a second plant or expand the existing 
facility, it said.

DOW SOARS 51.74 ON INTEREST RATE HOPES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks soared for a second straight session today as hopes mounted that the 
Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates and oil prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 51.74 points, or 2%, at 2,540.35. The 
advance was broadly based, with gaining shares outpacing losers by almost 3 to 
1 on moderately heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of 161.39 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp jump in the 30-share index followed a gain of 44.80 points made 
Friday as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lower rates -- possibly as 
soon as this week -- in an effort to jolt the weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to optimism was the belief that war is not imminent in the Persian Gulf, 
which helped drive oil prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil for December delivery dropped more than $2 a barrel, to 
about $31.75 a barrel, in today's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's de-escalation of the war premium, the prospect that war might be 
delayed," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman 
Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, up 2 3/8 
at 112 5/8; American Express, up 1 3/4 at 21 3/8; General Electric, up 1 1/2 at 
55 1/4, and Philip Morris, up 7/8 at 49 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Corp. rose 1/4 to 1 7/8 in active trading following the weekend news of 
a conditional bid for Pan Am by Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal bonds prices were higher in early trading today, but corporate bond 
prices were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was subdued, however, as the market for U.S. government bonds was 
closed in observance of the Veterans Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier trading in London, U.S. Treasury bonds were buoyed by weak oil 
prices to close with prices firmly higher than levels reached in New York on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's credit easing is likely to spur a one-half percentage point cut in 
the prime lending rate, and home mortgage rates should decline modestly as 
well, many analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
Any reduction in the prime rate, which has been stuck at 10% since January, 
would be seen as a boost to economic activity because about one-third of all 
consumer and business loans are tied to changes in the prime. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's top policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet 
behind closed doors Tuesday to map interest rate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists were forecasting that Fed officials would, at the very least, 
vote to lower the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on 
overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were looking for an even more dramatic signal that the Fed was 
easing credit conditions in the form of a cut in the Fed's discount rate, the 
interest the Fed charges to commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
There was less consensus on that development, however. The Fed hasn't reduced 
its discount rate, 6.5%, in more than four years.

NFL: MONDAY REPORT;

JOCKEYING FOR PLAYOFF SPOTS MURKY AT BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just to remind people that 16 games is a long season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here come the Saints, Packers and Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
There go the Bucs and, to a lesser extent, the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
While the Giants, 49ers, Bears, Dolphins and Bills continue to sail along at 
the top of the NFL with a combined record of 42-3, the jockeying for secondary 
playoff positions is changing every week. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the action Sunday was on the West Coast, where the Packers handed the 
Raiders their first home loss of the Art Shell regime. The Raiders, who had won 
10 straight at the Coliseum under Shell, now are 6-3 and officially out of the 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
And the 4-5 Packers are back in the NFC wild-card race, along with the 4-5 
Saints, who have unleashed Craig (Ironhead) Heyward and the defense in two 
straight wins by a total of 56-14. 
</P>
<P>
Heyward, who had 35 yards in 11 carries in his first seven games, gained 277 
yards in 39 carries the past two weeks, including 155 yards in Sunday's 35-7 
destruction of the sliding Bucs. Tampa Bay, which started 4-2, now has lost 
four straight and has been outscored 102-23 in the last three. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Chargers, who improved to 5-5 with a 19-7 win over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is only 1 1/2 games behind the Raiders and a half-game behind the 
Chiefs in the AFC West and the difference is quarterbacking. 
</P>
<P>
Steve DeBerg of the Chiefs and Jay Schroeder of the Raiders have had 
predictable off-days the past two weeks, while the Chargers' Billy Joe Tolliver 
hasn't thrown an interception in four games (121 attempts), after throwing 
eight in the first six games. Kansas City hasn't scored an offensive touchdown 
in 10 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But the key is defense for the Chargers, who are 5-5 after a 2-5 start. In 
their first five games, they allowed 322 yards per game and were minus-four in 
turnover ratio; in their last five, they've allowed 199.8 yards and are plus-15 
in turnovers, as Burt Grossman, Lee Williams, Leslie O'Neal have all 
demonstrated Pro Bowl capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"They're as good up front as any team we've played this year," John Elway of 
Denver (3-6), another team going south fast, said of the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
23-Second Drill -- Against Green Bay last week, Joe Montana drove the 49ers to 
a touchdown in 27 seconds just before the half. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, he drove the 'Niners to within field-goal range in 23 seconds, 
throwing a 27-yard pass to Jerry Rice on the sideline with no timeouts left to 
set up Mike Cofer's last-second kick. 
</P>
<P>
One reason? 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers set Rice alone on the left side against single coverage while they 
had three receivers right. One of them was backup quarterback Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Physical -- The AFC is supposed to be the less physical conference. 
</P>
<P>
But the NFL's four leading sack teams are all from the AFC -- the Dolphins and 
Chiefs with 35 each; the Chargers and Raiders with 32.

ABC WILL AIR USC-UCLA AT ROSE BOWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although lacking its usual Rose Bowl ramifications, ABC announced today that it 
will televise Saturday's USC-UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Jackson and Bob Griese will call the 12:30 p.m. game from the Rose Bowl 
that will air live on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be shown nationwide, except in most of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, ABC said it would televise either the USC-UCLA or 
Washington-Washington State games. However, the latter game lost much of its 
luster Saturday when the then-second-ranked Huskies were upset by UCLA, 25-22, 
and Notre Dame kept its spot atop the Associated Press poll with a 34-29 win 
over Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Had ABC opted against showing USC-UCLA, the game could have aired on cable's 
Prime Ticket Network, which owns the cable rights to Pacific 10 Conference 
games.

<P>
as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Runnin' Rebels, who won the national championship after being the preseason 
No. 1 last season, were banned from this year's NCAA Tournament and won't be 
able to defend their title. But that didn't stop the voters from making them 
No. 1 today. 
</P>
<P>
All but 15 of the 65 voters on the national board of writers and broadcasters 
listed UNLV first on their ballots. The Runnin' Rebels had 1,601 points, well 
ahead of Arkansas, 1,506, and Arizona, 1,488, which each received five 
first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State was fourth with one first-place vote and 1,302 points and was 
followed in the Top Ten by North Carolina, Duke, Alabama, Indiana, Georgetown 
and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is ranked 11th. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV has four starters back from the team that beat Duke, 103-73, in the most 
lopsided championship game ever played. All-American Larry Johnson and 
defensive star Stacey Augmon both opted to return to the Runnin' Rebels rather 
than go to the NBA, only to find out in July they could not defend their title. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Tarkanian, the center of the 14-year-old allegations, and the 
school offered several alternative punishments to the NCAA's Infractions 
Committee last month, and it is possible the postseason ban for 1991 may yet be 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina had 1,282 points, 120 more than Duke, which received two 
first-place votes. Alabama had 1,110 points to edge Indiana by 21. Georgetown 
had the final two first-place votes and 1,054 points, while Ohio State's 887 
points made the Buckeyes the third Big Ten team in the Top Ten with Michigan 
State and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina and Indiana both have freshmen to thank for their lofty 
rankings. The Tar Heels have the nation's top recruiting class with five 
players led by 7-foot Eric Montross, while Indiana's young team will be 
augmented by highly publicized guard Damon Bailey, who was scrutinized 
nationally throughout his successful high school career in the Hoosier state.

BECKER STILL HAS A CHANCE AT EARNING NO. 1 RANKING WITH VICTORY AT THE ATP 
</P>

<P>
Boris Becker set one goal for 1990: earn the No. 1 spot in the world tennis 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
That goal still is attainable as the inaugural ATP Tour comes to a climax with 
the season-ending World Championships that begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Becker's peers think he already is above the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the best tennis player in the world," said Pete Sampras, the U.S. Open 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Becker trails Sweden's Stefan Edberg by 225 points on the computer rankings of 
the Assn. of Tennis Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
If Becker wins the $2-million event and Edberg falters in the semifinals, 
Becker will have achieved his goal: He will end the year as No. 1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But Becker has a torn muscle in his left thigh that forced him to default in 
the recent Paris Open final. He was still in Munich today, training with Nikki 
Pilic, Germany's Davis Cup coach. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Evans, an ATP spokesman, said Becker also was undergoing treatment. 
Evans said Becker would not be scheduled to play until Wednesday, giving him 
more time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Becker began the year by announcing that he was skipping the Davis Cup in order 
to concentrate on capturing the No. 1 ranking. This was a blow to the German 
team, which had won the Davis Cup title twice in a row with Becker's help. This 
year, the Germans were eliminated early. 
</P>
<P>
The computer ranking system could allow Becker to claim the No. 1 spot although 
he failed to win any of the four Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The players are ranked according to the points earned in their best 14 
tournaments of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Although he might benefit from the system, Becker has said that Grand Slam 
tournaments should carry more weight in determining the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Becker has won five titles this season, and reached the final in five others. 
</P>
<P>
The ATP Championships features the world's top eight players. In addition to 
Edberg and Becker, others competing are Sampras, who is ranked fifth; Ivan

SANTOS NIPS AT HIS HEELS AS STEVENS BIDS FOR RIDING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the popular 27-year-old jockey from Caldwell, Ida., who has been 
riding in Southern California for six years, is on a mission to deny Jose 
Santos a fifth straight national riding championship. 
</P>
<P>
The drama of leader Stevens' quest was heightened this month when Santos, who 
has been stationed in the East since his U.S. arrival from Chile in 1984, moved 
his base to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens began Hollywood Park's fall meeting, which commenced Nov. 7, about 
$700,000 ahead of Santos with purse earnings of approximately $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Santos' agent, Frank Sanabria, believes Santos would have had an excellent 
chance of overtaking his Western rival had Santos remained in the East to ride 
days in New York and nights in nearby New Jersey. Santos nonetheless decided to 
go ahead with the move to Hollywood Park that had been planned for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Santos still could turn the tide with a victory or two in some of the fall 
meeting's major stakes. The $1-million Hollywood Futurity, for instance, offers 
a winner's share of $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose and I are very good friends," Stevens said. "I really respect him as a 
rider. We have the toughest riding colony in the country, I feel, and it's 
great to have Jose out here. I say that because I don't think you can ever have 
enough good riders. It's great to go out and ride with the best in the game. 
It's a great challenge." 
</P>
<P>
On his success this year, Stevens said, "Everything basically has just fallen 
into place. Early in the year, we really didn't have any goal to be national 
leader. I was still coming back from the broken wrist at Del Mar that cost me 
seven weeks and just trying to establish my business again. Then along about 
March, I was riding Mister Frisky, who won the Santa Anita Derby. We picked up 
Ruhlmann for the Big Cap. Boom, all a sudden, we're $1 million in front." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said it has been one of those years where everything really has fallen 
into place. 
</P>
<P>
"Two months ago, for example, I had seven mounts for the Breeders' Cup. It 
looked like I was going to have four that were going to be either the favorite 
or one of the favorites. It looked like I had a great shot to win maybe three 
or four Breeders' Cup races. Within a month of the Breeders' Cup, I was down to 
three horses, and it looked like my only legitimate shot might be with Golden 
Pheasant. He broke down the week before. Boom. There I was with nothing for the 
Breeders' Cup. But then I picked up In The Wings five days before the Breeders' 
Cup and we win the $2 million. It's been that kind of year."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SOME MEDICINES CAN INDUCE DISTRESSING SWINGS IN MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON

<TEXT>
<P>
The woman thought she was going crazy. Hallucinations, severe insomnia and 
extreme restlessness that would not let her sit still for a minute sent her to 
a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
He recognized a toxic reaction to the medicine her family physician had 
prescribed for heartburn. Once she stopped taking the drug, she returned to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising number of medications can produce symptoms that mimic mental 
illness. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, panic and even hallucinations can be 
brought on by certain prescription or over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
Prozac (fluoxetine) is one of the most controversial medicines in the pharmacy. 
It has been heralded as a breakthrough against psychological depression and has 
undoubtedly saved many lives. But some people experience serious psychological 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
We have heard from some people who suffered depression while on Inderal 
(propranolol) for their heart, and didn't realize that their black mood was 
caused by the drug until their doctors changed the prescription for some other 
reason. Others have experienced much the same reactions from beta blocker eye 
drops prescribed for glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
Alarming reactions sometimes occur with apparently innocuous medicines. A 
reader using a Transderm Scop patch for motion sickness caused by deep sea 
fishing found that she became extremely tired and incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes stopping a medicine can cause a psychiatric reaction. One woman was 
prescribed Xanax (alprazolam) because of anxiety associated with heart surgery. 
When her cardiologist eventually told her to quit the medicine, she went 
through hell. Anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, muscle twitching and 
disorientation were intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly stopping benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Halcion (triazolam) or Valium 
(diazepam) after long-term use can produce serious symptoms that may make a 
person question his sanity. To avoid difficulties, gradual withdrawal is 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
We have prepared a special brochure for readers of this column describing 
medications that have psychiatric side effects. If you would like a copy of the 
Graedons' Guide to Drug-Induced Mental Illness, please send a large (no. 10) 
self-addressed stamped envelope and $1 to: Graedons' People's Pharmacy, Dept. 
M, P.O. Box 52027, Durham, NC 27717-2027.

JAPAN'S BART; 
</P>
<P>
RELENTLESS MEDIOCRITY WINS OVER OVERACHIEVING PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like her American cousin Bart Simpson, the popular Japanese cartoon character 
Chibi Marukochan is out to prove it's OK to be an underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
Her relentless mediocrity has won over a nation obsessed with overachieving, 
making Chibi an unlikely idol and the year's hottest fad. 
</P>
<P>
The lazy third-grader of slurred speech and bob-cut hair even looks a bit like 
Bart. Both are drawn two-dimensionally, with a minimum of detail and unsure 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Chibi's self-proclaimed ambition is to get away with doing the minimum, but her 
market performance has been phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
More than 9 million copies of her comic books have been sold, and the spinoff 
television show has the nation's top rating, with two in every five sets tuned 
in each Sunday at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The show's theme song of nonsensical lyrics has sold 1.7 million compact discs 
and cassette tapes. It is heard endlessly in Japan's countless karaoke bars, 
where drinkers provide the singing voices to recorded music tracks from popular 
songs. (Kara means empty; Oke means orchestra). 
</P>
<P>
A leading toy maker, the TAKARA Co., figures to make $40 million this year on 
Chibi Marukochan dolls, badges and games. People have been arrested for selling 
fake Chibi T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologists hold seminars at Waseda University on the Chibi Marukochan 
phenomenon, and her likeness graced a portable shrine at Tokyo National 
University of Fine Arts and Music's autumn festival. 
</P>
<P>
The Chibi frenzy doesn't grab everyone. Chikako Ogura, a well-known 
psychologist, sees something sinister in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The worshiping of kitsch bourgeois tastes is the underlying force in fascism," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
As with "The Simpsons," the story line for "Chibi Marukochan" centers on family 
and school friends. 
</P>
<P>
Both "are told from the child's point of view," said Kenji Shimizu of the Fuji 
Television Network programming division, who supervises the cartoon show. 
"That's why they talk the way real kids talk, not in proper complete sentences 
like Disney characters. And that's why kids gravitate so much" to Chibi. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu believes the two antiheroes "are exactly the same concept, except the 
cultures they reflect are totally different." 
</P>
<P>
Bart is a rude but ingratiating brat, while Chibi's comments tend to be 
muttered growls rather than outright statements. 
</P>
<P>
"She is more emotionally sensitive, which I see as a cultural difference," said 
Hiroyuki Horikomi, agent for Momoko Sakura, Chibi's creator. 
</P>
<P>
Chibi ponders for hours how to spend her $1.60 allowance. She envies the 
attention lavished on a schoolmate with a bloody nose. A new cordless telephone 
is a major family event. Cleaning up and homework are tasks to be avoided as 
long as possible.

LIZ SMITH: OPERA SINGER, ACTRESS BRINGS HER TALENTS TO THE 'KRAYS'

THAT IS the opera singer/actress Julia Migenes, portraying Judy Garland in the 
new movie about the terrible twin Kray brothers of London, "The Krays." I guess 
somebody made Julia an offer she couldn't refuse. . . . Insiders are watching 
with wonder since Giancarlo Parretti sprang for $1.3 billion to buy MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
They wonder if financier Mario Gabelli has something similar in mind. He just 
bought 7,180,000 shares of Paramount. . . . Time Inc. is going to break my 
heart if it folds Entertainment Weekly. But it looks like they will. When you 
add this to their phase-out of that cable TV magazine several years back, it 
means Time will be marching on to the tune of a $100-million loss on these two 
projects alone. . . . British interests are claiming to have found huge 
potential oil areas around the Falkland Islands and in Argentina; maybe an even 
bigger find than the fields of the North Sea! . . . Baghdad's Saddam Hussein, a 
culture vulture? He has been begging opera's Placido Domingo to pay him a 
visit, but the great Spanish singer has declined. 
</P>
<P>
ANTHONY FRANCIOSA was one of Hollywood's big leading men in the '50s and '60s 
and a major theater actor. Now he is in rehearsal to make his musical debut and 
perform in his first-ever singing role in the international tour of Tommy 
Tune's "Grand Hotel, The Musical." (It won five Tony Awards in 1990.) The show 
bows in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, also, that Tony was the first husband of Shelley ("I Never Met an 
Italian I Didn't Like") Winters.

ABC CANCELS STEVEN BOCHCO'S EXPERIMENTAL SERIES 'COP ROCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Bochco's "Cop Rock," the police show set to music, has been canceled 
after its Dec. 26 broadcast, ABC announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The series from the creator of "L.A. Law" and "Hill Street Blues," was an 
experimental series that tried to use four or five musical numbers per hourlong 
episode to push the plot along in a sort of musical "Hill Street." 
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, said in making the 
announcement: 
</P>
<P>
"In 'Cop Rock' Stephen Bochco delivered a daring and brilliantly produced 
series, one all of us at ABC are proud to be associated with."

'CHILD'S PLAY' SEQUEL NO. 1 AT BOX OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
FILMS: KEVIN COSTNER'S 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' DEBUTS WITH THE HIGHEST PER-SCREEN 
AVERAGE OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The holiday movie season got a rousing send-off over the weekend, with the 
horror sequel "Child's Play II" taking the No. 1 spot with $10.7 million at the 
turnstiles, and "Dances With Wolves" riding to glory in limited release, with 
ticket sales of $598,257 on 14 screens -- for the year's highest per-screen 
average, of $42,733. 
</P>
<P>
The slate even got a boost from "Ghost," the seemingly eternal summer holdover. 
The Paramount Pictures film jumped 37% to take third place over the weekend 
with $4.3 million in ticket sales, a feat some sources attributed to reports 
that "Ghost" was the year's top-grossing film to date. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely on our way for the holidays," declared John Krier, president 
of Exhibitor Relations, which provides box-office information to exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
Krier predicted healthy numbers for films set to open through Christmas. "This 
is the earliest we've ever gotten started -- and the signs are certainly more 
than healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Child's Play II" is a follow-up to the 1988 sleeper about a murderous doll 
named Chucky. The Universal Pictures sequel opened on 1,996 screens for a solid 
per-screen average of $5,370. 
</P>
<P>
The first "Child's Play" with the murderous pint-size doll opened on Nov. 9, 
1988, to $8 million on 1,377 screens, an average of $4,781 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the per-screen numbers for "Dances With Wolves" -- some of the 
highest in recent years -- that sent the industry buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
Its $42,733 gives it one of the highest platformed-openings of recent years, 
following "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987) with $48,577 and "Born on the Fourth 
of July" (1989) with $43,005. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by a massive marketing and publicity campaign -- including lots of 
press coverage of star/first-time director Kevin Costner -- "Dances With 
Wolves" opened to largely positive reviews, the New York Times being a major 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the film's three-hour length and the fact that Westerns have not 
done well at the box office lately, "Dances" was considered a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
But based on opening weekend figures, Orion executives are anticipating a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those times when everything came together -- including the fact 
that we had an exceptional film to work with," said David Forbes, president of 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently in release in eight cities -- Los Angeles, New York, Washington, 
Chicago, Dallas, Seattle, San Francisco and Toronto, "Dances" will widen to 
approximately 1,000 screens Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere at the weekend box office: 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures' psychological thriller "Jacob's Ladder" -- which last week 
dominated the box office -- dropped a rung and more than 30%, to the No. 2 spot 
with ticket sales of about $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures' comedy, "Sibling Rivalry" was in fourth place, with ticket 
sales of approximately $3 million, and Warner Bros.' "Reversal of Fortune" 
ranked fifth, with grosses of about $2.5 million.
