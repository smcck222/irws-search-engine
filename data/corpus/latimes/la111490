Randy Keser was growing weary of all the media attention that resulted from 
Only in L.A.'s mention of the "Wife Wanted" sign on his car. He yearns to be a 
spouse, not a sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was phoned by a talk-show host in Roanoke, Va. "After we went off the 
air, she said she was interested in me herself," said Keser, a 40-year-old 
aspiring actor. "We're going to talk some more." 
</P>
<P>
The national attention that he's received has inspired him to acquire an agent 
and write a screenplay, "The Man With the Sign." Keser feels that when he does 
find Ms. Right, the nuptials could be a media event. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wondering if I could get someone like Budweiser to sponsor the wedding," 
he said.

What was KNBC's lead story on its 11 p.m. newscast following NBC's "The Big One 
-- the Great L.A. Earthquake"? Why, viewer reaction to the movie, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The report was supplemented by the authoritative-sounding narration, which 
began off-camera, of a woman who confirmed how very realistic the movie was. 
</P>
<P>
Was the speaker a seismologist? No, it was Joanna Kerns, the actress who 
portrayed the seismologist.

<P>
No way that Only in L.A. would have been so provincial as to watch the movie 
itself -- not when the stakes were so much higher on Channel 5's "Masters of 
the Universe" ("a mighty struggle to save the galaxy!"). We did listen to the 
Channel 5 news afterward, wondering whether there might be a segment on viewers 
worried about planets going to war.

"Look up at the sky Wednesday Nov. 14 between 12-1:30 p.m.," says the cryptic 
ad in the Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a publicity stunt, for a change, but a tribute. Anne Davison hired a 
plane to fly over Hollywood, carrying a banner that said, "I Love You Wild Bill 
Davison," this afternoon, on the first anniversary of the great clarinetist's 
death.

Vice President Dan Quayle was back in high school recently -- Beverly Hills 
High, where he took a couple of early morning jogs during a stopover in Century 
City. We learned this from the saucy new column of Carly Eiseman and Alex 
Karasik in the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The feature's called "Only in Beverly Hills." Stay on your side of the border, 
kids.

Clancy rambles on about "principles" we are defending in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
He failed, however, to explain why the U.S. has fielded most of the troops and 
why we may or will suffer the most casualties in defending these "principles." 
</P>
<P>
He failed to say what he will do if war breaks out there. Will he be on the 
front lines with our GIs reporting the combat action while dodging Iraqi gas 
bombs, or will he be seated at a word processor in his comfortable home writing 
a novel about war that could add a few million dollars to his already sizable 
wealth?

Clancy expresses a thought with which I have long concurred. Yet, proceeding 
from there, we come to diametrically opposite conclusions. The thought: 
"America is not a piece of dirt stretching mainly from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, America is a set of principles. . . ." He then says 
these principles demand that American forces be the world policemen, stamping 
out conflict wherever it arises. 
</P>
<P>
The implicit assumption is that all future commanders in chief will only find 
"just" causes for sending servicemen to their deaths. This seems quite unlikely 
in view of our past history. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, think that "America is a set of principles" that grew out of our 
Judeo-Christian tradition. According to that tradition, the abuse of anyone 
anywhere is an abuse of all of us. Despite service in two wars, I think wars 
sow the seeds of future wars in a never-ending cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Rather we should extend a helping hand to eradicate the conditions in which 
wars are incubated (and that includes civil strife as well.)

NFL: DAN HENNING HAD A LATE-NIGHT MEETING WITH HIS COACHES. IT SEEMS TO HAVE 
BROUGHT A NEW DAY FOR THE CHARGERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind closed locker-room doors Sunday after the Chargers had dumped the 
Broncos, 19-7, Coach Dan Henning offered a few remarks to his team. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, he then asked everyone to drop to a knee for a 
postgame prayer, but he was interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been giving these out all season," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver 
announced, while holding a game ball in the air. "It's about time we gave one 
to you." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver then tossed the football to Henning, and by all accounts, Tolliver 
completed the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Do you believe in miracles...yes! 
</P>
<P>
The team that was 1-4, and coached by Dan Henning, is now 5-5, and soon to be 
featured on NBC "NFL Live," and HBO's "Inside the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
No indication yet if it will also be shown on "Unsolved Mysteries," but what 
happened? 
</P>
<P>
It goes back to Pittsburgh, it seems, and all that could go wrong in a 34-16 
debacle. As defensive coordinator Ron Lynn has said, "We bottomed out." 
</P>
<P>
The down and out Chargers boarded their charter flight for home that evening in 
Pittsburgh, and as Henning said Tuesday, "I had four and a half hours on that 
plane to take stock of what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in San Diego, for the first time in Henning's tenure as head coach 
of the Chargers, he called a Sunday night meeting with his coaching staff at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just lost and we were really down," special teams coordinator Larry 
Pasquale said. "We were all wondering if we were doing the right thing and 
using players in the right manner, and he gave everybody an opportunity to 
speak their piece. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very needed gathering and very astute of Dan to do it at that time," 
he said. "It was very constructive. I've been in meetings like that, and when 
you come out you felt worse than when you went in. When we came out, we felt, 
OK, let's go to work." 
</P>
<P>
On that long plane ride home, Henning had watched his team lose again on 
videotape. Then he pulled out a sheet of paper and began writing down the 
critical mistakes that had led to his team's 1-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, 'What the hell is going on here?' " Henning said. "Defensively we used 
the same kind of thoughts last year and did well. But we had a new guy here and 
there, and so maybe he misses a coverage and then it's easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things started to fit in place for me. It was no lack of effort. It 
was guys who hadn't been in there enough, like Junior Seau, Henry Rolling, 
Donald Frank and Les Miller. And there were adjustments on offense; it was just 
a bunch of little things." 
</P>
<P>
The public, however, was clamoring for a change in starting quarterbacks, if 
not in head coaches. They wanted action, and Henning was talking status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not question what I believed in, but I was concerned about why it was 
not transferring into sounder play?" Henning said. "I had my ideas what was 
wrong, but I wanted to hear it from them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to have 12 coaches up there that get paid a lot of money to be 
experts, and I wanted them to talk and bring out what they thought." 
</P>
<P>
They talked that night in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium amongst themselves. 
They went around the table. They reviewed their problems, and they realized 
they were not so bad. They took another look at their athletes, and they agreed 
they weren't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
"To their credit, I think everybody in there voiced some things," Henning said, 
"and accepted some things that might not have been in the best interests of 
them and their group." 
</P>
<P>
The next day the defensive coaches reviewed the work of the Chargers' offense 
on videotape, while the offensive staff examined the defense. Then the 
assistant coaches gathered with Henning and players for a "let-it-all-hang-out" 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"You open it up; there's some negatives about doing it that way, but I thought 
it was necessary to make sure everybody understood what had to be done," 
Henning said, "and if they had any ideas to air them right there. Let's get 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it's all laid out there, the problems, the solutions, and the actions 
then to implement the solutions, then you just gotta get a commitment," he 
said. "If we do this, we got a chance to get better. If we don't, then we're 
going to continue the way we are." 
</P>
<P>
At that all-important meeting, Henning impressed upon his players that they 
were going to remain his players. No wholesale changes. No need. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was sticking with us," linebacker Gary Plummer said, "and we 
realized he was sticking his neck out for us." 
</P>
<P>
The players were attentive that Monday following the loss in Pittsburgh. They 
were 1-4, and in their morning newspapers they noticed that even the defense 
had come under criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nothing I had heard here before," safety Martin Bayless said. "Nobody's 
ever pointed a finger in Ron Lynn's face. I guess nobody is too big to be 
criticized, and Dan did what he had to do at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Henning had expressed concern about the team's defense after a 17-7 loss to 
Houston, but no one was listening. After the disaster in Pittsburgh, he said 
defensive players and defensive coaches needed to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it personally," linebacker Leslie O'Neal said. "I was really surprised 
he had said that, but then since then we've come on and made plays." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the plays: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the first five games, the Chargers' defense ranked 16th in the league, 
while surrendering an average of 322 yards, 20 first downs and 21 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the last five games, the defense has ranked second only to Miami, while 
giving up an average of 199 yards, 13 first downs and 11.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"In studying films of the first five games, we knew we could not win football 
games this year if our defense was on the field for a long time," Henning said. 
"Now the popular thought is that the offense has to do well for the defense not 
to be on the field a long time, but that's bull. 
</P>
<P>
"A defense determines its own time on the field. We reiterated that at the time 
of our meeting: What we have to do on defense, is we have to make the 
opposition's offense get off the field, and get off the field fast." 
</P>
<P>
While the defense has clamped down on the opposition, Tolliver has not thrown 
an interception since the team's final offensive play against Pittsburgh. He 
has been sacked only six times in the past five games, and the Chargers' 
special teams have emerged as one of the leaders in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest with you, I just didn't think we could play as well as we have 
played in these four wins," Henning said. "But we're doing it, and it's good 
enough to keep winning" 
</P>
<P>
And when it's all over, and Super Bowl historians look back for the magic 
moment that ignited it all, they can begin in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last five weeks, it's been fine, but let's see what happens in the 
next five," Henning said. "It isn't just a right turn into oblivion and it 
isn't just a right turn into ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
. . . Unless you believe in miracles.

BUCKS DON'T STOP ANYWHERE AS THEY IMPROVE TO 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before almost every season there is a tendency to rate the Milwaukee Bucks 
among the also-rans. Invariably, the Bucks finish near the top. 
</P>
<P>
When Don Nelson was the coach, he was given all the credit for making something 
out of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is about time to accord some of the same treatment to Del Harris, now 
in his fourth season at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts figured the Bucks for fifth or worse in the tough Central 
Division. Once again they are acting as if they are better than that. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sikma scored 21 points Tuesday night at Milwaukee and the 5-1 Bucks 
dominated from start to finish. After taking a 15-2 lead, they sprinted to a 
119-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Before Harris emptied his bench, the Bucks built an 84-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird played one of the worst games of a brilliant career. He played 28 
minutes, scored only five points and had only five rebounds. He was two for 
seven from the field. The Celtics shot only 40.7% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 128, San Antonio 124 -- David Robinson had 32 points and 18 
rebounds, but the Spurs couldn't handle the Warriors at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Richmond had 31 points and Tim Hardaway and Chris Mullin each added 24 as 
the Warriors improved to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors pulled away to an 11-point lead midway through the last quarter 
and held off a Spur rally. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 155, Denver 129 -- It was the winless Nuggets' seventh consecutive 
defeat, but they got a moral victory at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten Trail Blazers (6-0) failed to get a club record for points by one 
point. They had four shots after pulling to within one point of the record and 
missed them all. 
</P>
<P>
New York 116, Seattle 110 -- After rookie Gary Payton made a layup to send the 
game into overtime at Seattle, the SuperSonics fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Tucker sank a three-point basket with slightly less than a minute left in 
overtime to give New York a 112-110 lead. Patrick Ewing, who had 28 points, 
sank two free throws and Gerald Wilkins made a layup to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who have won four in a row, are 3-0 in the West and finish the tour 
at Portland Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 109, Dallas 103 -- Apparently, the Mavericks were still in shock from 
learning that Roy Tarpley was out for the season, because they weren't ready to 
face the Magic at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Catledge scored 30 points and the Magic won for the first time after 
opening the season with six defeats. They also ended a 16-game home losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley underwent knee surgery and might return in time for the playoffs. Fat 
Lever, due back in five weeks, also is recovering from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 84, Utah 82 -- The real Michael Jordan showed up at Salt Lake City. 
Jordan sank a jumper as the game ended to give the Bulls their fourth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, the Jazz's Karl Malone missed two shots. With 16 seconds 
to play, the Bulls called time out. 
</P>
<P>
John Paxson dribbled the ball until there were two seconds left. He passed to 
Jordan, who despite the close guarding of Jeff Malone got off a 15-footer as 
the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Malone had 28 points and 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 120, Washington 105 -- Armon Gilliam outscored NBA scoring leader 
Bernard King and also had 12 rebounds at Charlotte to lead the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
King, playing the way he did before the injury that almost ended his career 
five years ago, had 34 points. Gilliam had 39, just one short of the club 
record held by Kelly Tripucka. Gilliam was 16 of 24 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 118, Miami 93 -- The Pistons, who struggled on their trip West, 
returned home and put the Heat away in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas, who discarded the goggles he was wearing to protect his eyes 
after missing his first three shots, had 23 points. He had six of them during a 
19-1 spurt in the first quarter that gave the Pistons a 31-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 121, Atlanta 104 -- Last week, Cavalier Coach Len Wilkens shook up 
his lineup, inserting veteran forward Larry Nance and rookie guard Gerald 
Paddio. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been amazing. With Nance and Paddio leading the way the 
Cavaliers won at Atlanta, where they had lost 11 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Nance had 21 points and 14 rebounds, while Paddio had 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 108, Indiana 100 -- Charles Barkley scored 19 of his 23 points in 
the second half at Indianapolis to lead the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
With Barkley having missed all four of his shots, the 76ers trailed, 46-44, at 
halftime. They didn't take command until the middle of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 90, Minnesota 88 -- It was a tough struggle for the Rockets at Houston, 
but there was a good reason. They were without their star, Akeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon missed his first start in 184 games after suffering a sprained ankle 
during Sunday's game at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
With 24 seconds to play, David Wood tipped a pass from Otis Thorpe into the 
basket to give the Rockets an 89-88 lead. After Minnesota's Tod Murphy missed 
an 18-footer, Vernon Maxwell made one of two free throws for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, playing center in place of Olajuwon, had 20 points and 13 rebounds. DAN

HULL GETS BACK ON TRACK FOR BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Quebec Nordiques knew they were in for trouble. Hockey's hottest scorer 
failed to get a goal in his previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull scored twice, including the tiebreaker with 74 seconds to play 
Tuesday night at St. Louis and the Blues won, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 11th consecutive loss for the Nordiques, who outplayed Montreal 
Sunday night but lost in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
In this game they battled the Norris Division leaders to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
But, with overtime looming, Hull knocked in the rebound after goalie Ron 
Tugnutt stopped Rod Brind'Amour's shot. Rich Sutter added an empty-net goal 
with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Hull had to control a wobbly puck on his fifth game-winning goal of the season 
and ended up with a sharp-angled shot as he skated close to the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't looking anywhere," he said. "I just knew (Tugnutt) was down and I had 
to get the puck up. I was running out of room." 
</P>
<P>
Hull has 19 goals in 18 games and the Blues are off to their best start ever 
(13-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Blues said they didn't play well much of the game. Hull said the 
Blues' ineffective five-on-three advantage for more than a minute in the third 
period was "the worst I've ever seen. You've got to expect the best in every 
team, and we just took them lightly." 
</P>
<P>
The Blues are 11-1-1 since Oct. 14. And the are 6-1-1 on their home ice. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, Montreal 3 -- Dave Maley and John MacLean scored 44 seconds apart 
in the middle of the third period at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended the Devils' three-game losing streak and left them only six 
points out offirst place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Devils' second victory in their last eight games against the 
Canadiens, who missed a chance to regain first place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 1, Philadelphia 1 -- In a tYpically tough battle between 
Patrick Division contenders at Philadelphia, the Flyers dominated, but couldn't 
win. 
</P>
<P>
After both teams scored in the second period, the Flyers did almost all the 
threatening. In the last 25 minutes, the Flyers outshot the Rangers, 14-5. 
</P>
<P>
Flyer goalie Pete Peeters has yielded only one goal in the last 135 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers learned that Tim Kerr, their all-time leading goal-scorer will 
undergo knee surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Minnesota 1 -- Goalie Frank Pietrangelo emerged from the 
Penguins' doghouse with a spectacular performance at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Pietrangelo, benched for two games after an indifferent performance, stopped 42 
shots to help the Penguins win despite being outshot, 43-23. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bellows beat Pietrangelo in the second period, but the Penguins improved 
to 6-2-1 in their last nine games. DAN HAFNER

FANN NAMED WFC OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF YEAR FOR 2ND SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four running backs had more rushing yardage, but when it came time for Western 
Football Conference coaches to vote for the conference's top offensive player 
of this season, the choice was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Fann of Cal State Northridge was selected as the WFC's top offensive 
player for the second consecutive season, it was announced Tuesday. Pat Moore 
of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was the defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a senior tailback, rushed for 918 yards and 10 touchdowns and led the 
Matadors in receptions with 28 catches for 218 yards. He averaged 20.4 yards on 
23 kickoff returns despite playing injured in all or part of four games. 
</P>
<P>
"Some other people had better statistics, but Albert was the dominant player in 
the league," said Northridge's Bob Burt, who shared WFC coach-of-the-year 
honors with San Luis Obispo's Lyle Setencich. "If you don't stop Albert, he's 
going to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a Division II All-American last year, becomes Northridge's first 
four-time, first-team, all-conference football player. 
</P>
<P>
"My stats weren't great, but head to head with the other guys I outplayed them, 
I suppose," Fann said. "I think that made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Portland State tailback Curtis Delgardo, Cal State Sacramento tailback Troy 
Mills, San Luis Obispo quarterback David Lafferty and Southern Utah State 
lineman Randy Bostic also were nominated for the award. 
</P>
<P>
When Northridge played Portland State, Fann outgained Delgardo, 127 yards to 
75; he rushed for 181 yards and three touchdowns in 32 carries, compared to 121 
yards in 24 carries for Mills. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo, which shared the WFC championship with Northridge, placed a 
conference-leading 17 players on the 70-member squad. Moore, a 6-foot-2, 
265-pound defensive end, is a two-time first-team selection. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Northridge and San Luis Obispo dominated the honors for defense. 
The Matadors and the Mustangs have two of the stingiest defenses against the 
run in Division II and they combined to place nine players on the 14-member 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
Alo Sila, CSUN's 6-1, 265-pound junior nose tackle, joined a trio of San Luis 
Obispo players -- including Andres Washington, a 6-2, 255-pound end who played 
at Glendale College -- on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Baron Atkinson of Northridge made the first team at cornerback and Matador 
linebackers Terrell Taylor, Ken Wallace, Kenny Vaughn and Mario Hull all 
received votes. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Wallace, both seniors, were first-team selections. Vaughn, a junior 
from Toledo, Ohio, made the second team and Hull, who starred at Cleveland 
High, was an honorable-mention selection despite missing the last two games of 
the season because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Tom Berry, a senior from La Palma, Calif., and safety Eric Treibatch, a 
sophomore who attended Montclair Prep, were Northridge's other second-team 
selections on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Three Northridge offensive linemen were named to the all-conference team: 
tackle Don Goodman and center Skip Allum were second-team selections and tackle 
John Chase was honorable mention.

REVERSING THE TIDE;

<P>
3 NATIONAL TITLES HELP CORSO BATTLE UPSTREAM IN PURSUIT OF OLYMPIC POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About two years ago, a newspaper headline proclaimed that Harvard High water 
polo Coach Rich Corso would "test Olympic waters" by running for the elected 
job oS. national team head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Corso plunged in. Glub, glub. Not only did he lose the election, but the U. S. 
Olympic water polo association denied him a staff position on the national 
team, with which he had served since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
While Corso didn't really expect to win the election -- the incumbent had led 
the United States to the silver medal in Seoul -- he did feel he deserved to 
stay on the staff based on his success as coach of the U. S. junior national 
team. So the rebuff angered him and hurt his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"I had assumed I'd always coach a U. S. national team," Corso said. "I thought 
I had a job for life." 
</P>
<P>
Corso moped around for a few days, even considered quitting Harvard and 
coaching a club team in Germany. But then he got over it. "I realized I just 
wasn't figured into the master plan for that quadrennium," he said. "So I just 
went on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
With his head well above water. 
</P>
<P>
While Corso has not done any active campaigning recently for national team head 
coach -- current Coach Bill Barnett might step down after the '92 Olympics -- 
he has been content to let his record speak for itself: His Harvard Water Polo 
Foundation club team has won the past three senior men's U. S. championships, 
including last month's indoor event in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which includes Olympians Terry Schroeder and Craig Wilson, has 
dominated men's water polo in this country for the past 1 1/2 years, even 
winning the UCLA Invitational. Ironically, its formation is the direct result 
of Corso's rejection by the national team. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time that happened, Corso was offered an assistant coaching job 
with European Cup champion Wasserfreunde Spandau 04, and he impulsively 
considered taking it, almost out of spite. "I was ready to go," he said. So he 
went in and talked with Harvard headmaster Tom Hudnut, who advised him to stay 
put and then asked, "Why not create your own Spandau over here?" Corso 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Hudnut then went about helping Corso develop the nonprofit Harvard Water Polo 
Foundation, which fields a team that practices at Harvard but has no 
affiliation with the school. Why to stay? "A number of people feel he should be 
the '96 Olympic coach," Hudnut said. "If he went to Germany, his motives would 
be suspect and there'd be some criticism. He has to clearly establish himself 
as the best water polo coach in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Hudnut has been a major force in Corso's career. He was hired as headmaster in 
1987, a year after Corso became coach at Harvard. Corso had chafed under 
Hudnut's predecessor, who didn't place much emphasis on sports, and he wasn't 
planning to return for a second year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was gone, out of here," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
Hudnut, however, stressed excellence in all endeavors, including sports. "He's 
been probably the determining factor in me staying at Harvard," said Corso, a 
personable 36-year-old New Englander. 
</P>
<P>
At Harvard, Corso has built the strongest water polo program in the area. Two 
years ago, his Saracens won their first Southern Section 2-A Division 
championship and Corso was named 2-A coach of the year. In 1989, the team moved 
to 3-A and it has reached the semifinals two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have won the 2-A but there's more of a challenge in 3-A," he said. 
"You also get more respect, and the kids are more attractive for colleges." 
</P>
<P>
In five years at Harvard, Corso has developed 11 water polo All-Americans and 
has sent numerous players to college. Some even play in Division I, including 
last year's goalie, Larry Bercutt, who starts for Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Corso is a terrific coach," Hudnut said. "Maybe the best water polo coach 
anywhere. He has great rapport with his students and the people he's coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Corso, who says his biggest satisfaction is "seeing kids improve," decided to 
become a water polo coach in his junior year at Southern Connecticut State, 
where he played the sport. He had started college as a physical education 
major, switched to political science, then to journalism before returning to 
P.E. 
</P>
<P>
At 21, he was named coach of the club team at Yale -- by the time he left to 
become an assistant at UCLA 18 months later water polo had become a varsity 
sport. Corso spent nine years under Bob Horn at UCLA. His junior-varsity teams 
compiled a 150-20 record and "could have been ranked in the varsity top 20," 
Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
While at UCLA, Corso was named coach of the U. S. national junior team for 
players aged 19 and under. He became the most successful coach in the team's 
history. In 1985 and '87, the team placed sixth in the world championships -- 
the highest finishes for a U. S. team -- and also won a gold medal at the '86 
Junior Pan-Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Corso's dual positions -- UCLA assistant and junior-team coach -- did not 
sit well within the water polo community. Some people felt that it was a 
conflict of interest for Corso to coach kids he could also recruit for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people cried foul," said Corso, who doesn't think he was left off the 
current national staff because of any residual hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who coaches at Newport Harbor High, also doesn't see any back-room 
politics in his decision not to retain Corso. "I just felt more comfortable 
with the other coaches I chose," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
After the '88 Olympics, virtually the entire U. S. water polo team retired, 
forcing Barnett to start from scratch. The World Championships in Perth, 
Australia, in January, will be a barometer of whether the U.S. team can 
continue to rank among the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett vacillates on his future with the national team. "I don't plan to run 
again," he said before adding, "at least that's how I feel now. I'll have to 
see what happens in '92." 
</P>
<P>
If Corso can hold his club team together and it continues to dominate national 
water polo, he'll be a strong candidate for Barnett's job, and he's not being 
shy about his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my career goal," he said.

EDWARDS PROVES HIS METTLE GIVEN FIGHTING CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ARREST AFTER BRAWL CAUSED DEFENSIVE BACK TO LEAVE ARIZONA BUT 
HE HAS RESURRECTED CAREER AT VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The evening of March 8, 1989, on the campus of the University of Arizona was, 
according to Tucson police, a night of racially motivated beatings. When it was 
over, 11 people required medical care. And Sam Edwards, a former All-City 
Section football player from Reseda High, was in jail, charged with 11 counts 
of assault. 
</P>
<P>
This is the story Edwards tells of that night: 
</P>
<P>
"Myself and three other members of the Arizona football team were standing 
around on campus. One of my friends was talking to his girlfriend, a white 
girl. All of a sudden these five guys, these cowboy-boot, fraternity kind of 
guys, walked by." One of them, according to Edwards, looked at the woman and 
made a racial slur about her companions. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, pretty soon there was a fight," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
When the fight was over, Edwards and his three friends -- all four of them 
black and undeniably victorious in their scuffle against the five men -- 
retired to their dormitory rooms for the night, Edwards said. But through the 
night, there were other fights on the Arizona campus between blacks and whites. 
In the morning, police arrested Edwards and the other three football players 
and charged them in all of the fights. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Edwards and the other three had been bounced from the 
University of Arizona. They were given two-year suspensions, even though they 
shouted out their innocence and the police story already had begun to unravel. 
It was the spring of 1989, and stories of football players' antisocial behavior 
were echoing from the campuses of the University of Oklahoma and the University 
of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, it seems, was determined not to join that list. 
</P>
<P>
Today, school administrators deny feeling any such pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no relationship whatsoever to the problems at any other university," 
said Bob Bockrath, Arizona's senior associate athletic director. "My sense is 
there was no relationship whatsoever between our action and Oklahoma or 
Colorado or any other school. I certainly hope that was the case. I believe it 
was just coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
The stifling afternoon sun beats down on the practice field at Valley College 
in Van Nuys. The grass is dead or dying from lack of water. Among the group of 
defensive backs going through their daily drills, one stands out. At 6-foot-3 
and more than 200 pounds of sinewy muscle, he glides effortlessly across the 
grass clumps. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Edwards, a young man with a world of talent for football, a guy who seemed 
to have more than a fleeting shot at playing in the NFL some day, has fallen 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of pounding ballcarriers and receivers in the Pacific-10 Conference 
before crowds of 60,000 or more and national television audiences each 
Saturday, he toils in near anonymity in the Western State Conference, playing 
for the Valley College Monarchs before tiny gatherings of close friends and 
relatives alongside clumpy fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days, I can't even believe what has happened to me," said Edwards, who 
redshirted his freshman year at Arizona. "I was in the penthouse of college 
football two years ago. Now I'm in the ghetto of college football. I can't 
understand how it all happened." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards has made the most of his situation. He easily could have put his cleats 
away and sulked himself out of the game. But after the banishment from Arizona, 
he realized quickly that he must keep himself on a playing field and prepare 
for a comeback in big-time college football. 
</P>
<P>
So he came home and found his way to Valley College. And he has played hard. In 
1989, he was named the Western State Conference's best defensive player after 
making a conference-high eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
This year, pulled from his usual position and moved closer to the line as a 
linebacker in most situations, he has responded once again. In a game earlier 
in the season against Glendale, his raw talents just overwhelmed the 
opposition. Edwards, playing furiously, made 14 unassisted tackles, assisted on 
five others and returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"That game was a freak show," Valley College coach Chuck Ferrero said. "At one 
point he made seven tackles in a row. It was the best defensive game by one 
player that I have ever seen. On one play, he pulled the ball out of the 
ballcarrier's arms and went 60 yards for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen a game like it." 
</P>
<P>
At times, when the fury peaks, Edwards appears to be a thoroughbred racing 
against a field of donkeys. He said those moments make him happy. But soon, the 
high is replaced by deep depression. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards knows he does not belong here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it every week when I'm watching a nationally televised game and 
I know that should be me on that field," he said. "I try to shake it off, but I 
always remember what that beautiful stadium at the University of Arizona looked 
like on game day. I can't forget it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I play now, I feel I have to play much better than the guys I play 
against. I'm supposed to be better. I can't be just as good, be just one of 
them. I have to show myself and everyone else that it was no joke, that me 
getting a Division I scholarship was not a fluke. I have to show every week 
that that is where I belong. Not here." 
</P>
<P>
After this season, Edwards said he will take the five recruiting trips allowed 
by the NCAA. He will have two years of eligibility remaining. He plans to use 
them wisely. He won't name the schools that have approached him, only that they 
are in the West and Midwest and that you likely have heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his agreement -- if anyone dare call it that -- with Arizona, he 
cannot go to a Pac-10 school other than Arizona. And it is unlikely that he 
would return to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
If he does, he will be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
As the prosecutors from the Pima County Attorney's Office began sifting their 
way through Edwards' case and the police reports, they quickly determined that 
there were some problems. For starters, only the five men who got into the 
brawl with Edwards and his football teammates identified Edwards. Victims of 
other fights later that night did not. Police, it seemed, had assumed that if 
Edwards and his friends had been in one fight that night, they were involved in 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 assault charges against Edwards were quickly reduced to six. Weeks 
later, after more investigation, three more were dropped. Attorney Theresa 
Millikin prepared to prosecute Edwards on three misdemeanor assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, you can say the police overreacted," said George Roylston of 
Tucson, who was Edwards' attorney. "The black population of Tucson is roughly 
three percent, and most of that number are students at the university. The 
whole thing was blown out of proportion. These were Class 1 misdemeanor 
assaults and the next morning the local papers made it sound like these kids 
were involved in gangland slayings. Murder cases here get much less attention 
than this case did. It happened just after the football players at Oklahoma 
were charged with rape, and people were ready to hammer any college athlete who 
got into any kind of brush with the law." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Edwards apparently decided he had seen enough of what he called 
"cactus-land justice" in Arizona. So he left, jumping a $500 bond and settling 
back into his parents' Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over with," Edwards said. "I think they dropped the charges or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a warrant in Pima County for Samuel Edwards' arrest," Millikin said. 
"The case is still open and he still faces three assault charges. If he shows 
up again in Pima County, we will try our best to find him and arrest him. But 
because the assault charges are misdemeanors, there will be no extradition 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt, then, as to why Arizona is not on Edwards' list of 
potential schools for his final two years of eligibility. Or why he has not 
fought the stipulation that he not attend another Pac-10 school. Might be a bit 
touchy for Edwards to try to explain to coach why he doesn't think he'll be 
making that trip to Tucson next week. 
</P>
<P>
Through the long and painful ordeal, though, Edwards said he has grown and 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight, I should have walked away that night, even though I believe we 
were provoked," he said. "But today, I would not allow that situation to come 
to blows. I would have gotten out of there, knowing what I had to lose. I 
learned a lot in that 20 minutes. I was 18 years old and dumb. You think you 
know a lot when you're 18, but you don't know much. I am not a trouble-maker. I 
never was."

CSUN OPPONENT PULLS PLUG ON BID TO BROADCAST GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CAL POLY SLO OFFICIALS FEAR THAT ALLOWING KADY TO TELEVISE 
DIVISION II PLAYOFF WOULD CUT ATTENDANCE. 
</P>

<P>
Television station KADY's plans to broadcast Saturday's Division II football 
playoff game between Cal State Northridge and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo were 
scuttled Tuesday by athletic officials from the host school. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo administrators denied the station permission to broadcast the 1 
p.m. game, saying they feared television coverage might adversely affect 
attendance. KADY had planned to televise the game on a delay basis beginning at 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, San Luis Obispo officials say, came down to a matter of money. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotta come up with some big bucks," said Ken Walker, San Luis Obispo's 
athletic director. "We submitted a bid based on a gate and we had to guarantee 
the NCAA a healthy fraction of it. We need to have as many people here as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said school officials might change their minds if advance ticket sales 
are brisk, but KADY sports director Clay Morgan said the station no longer is 
interested in televising the game. 
</P>

"We won't be doing it. We just can't," Morgan said. "If they called us back 
later this week, we'd have to say no. There's just too many logistics 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the station's broadcast of a Nov. 3 regular-season game between the 
same teams drew a very good response. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a ton of calls, people asking if we were going to do this week's 
game," Morgan said. "I was a little surprised (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) said 
no. But I understand." 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' earlier meeting, San Luis Obispo (9-1) defeated Northridge (7-3), 
6-3, before a capacity crowd of more than 7,000 at North Campus Stadium. The 
victory earned the Mustangs a share of the WFC championship with CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is making its first Division II playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game will be broadcast live on radio by KGIL 1260 and KJDJ 1030, 
beginning at 12:45 p.m.

STATWATCH: RESEDA DEFENSE GETS HELP FROM MANY QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reseda High, moved from the City Section 3-A Division into the 4-A North Valley 
League this year, is playing for the league title Friday. To no one's surprise, 
the Regents (5-3, 3-3 in league play) have done it with defense. 
</P>
<P>
However, finding a particular standout is tough. The Regents have allowed 
averages of 191.5 yards and 10.1 points a game, but just about everybody has 
been in on the act. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, what do Johnan Reece, Maurice Stepter, Henry McAlpine, Jon Van 
Duinwyk, Edgar Fernandez, Larry Trammel and Tim Schaeffer have in common? 
</P>
<P>
All are tied for the team lead in interceptions . . . with one. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: The El Camino Real defense is even stingier than Reseda's, allowing an 
average of 171.3 yards a game. Eight different Conquistadores have recorded 
interceptions, but only Ryan Marine (two) has more than one. . . . Thousand 
Oaks defensive tackle Mike Ciandella has 12 sacks, five short of the school 
record set last season by Nick Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing: Shawn Hardy was among those watching from the Glendale sideline as 
Pathon Rucker broke Hardy's single-season rushing record of 1,715 yards set 11 
years ago. Rucker, a junior, rushed for 209 yards to bring his season total to 
1,767. In addition, he leads all players in the state in scoring (192 points) 
and touchdowns (30). 
</P>
<P>
With his 136 yards Friday, Kennedy tailback Ontiwaun Carter topped the 
1,000-yard mark for the third consecutive season. As a sophomore, Carter rushed 
for 1,190 yards and as a junior, he gained 1,563. He has 1,045 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Reuben Allen was limited to a season-low 37 yards Friday, but he 
still set a school record for rushing yards in a season with 1,215, breaking 
Jamin McNeil's 1985 record of 1,204. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's Kent Dahn scored three touchdowns Saturday to set a single-season 
school mark of 19. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Ryan Connors has passed for 2,085 yards this season, becoming the 
fifth Hart quarterback in a row to break 2,000. Rob Westervelt passed for 2,064 
yards last season and Tom Bonds, Jim Bonds and Darren Renfro all broke the 
2,000-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
Five Marmonte League quarterbacks have thrown for more than 1,000 yards, and 
Thousand Oaks' Scott Peterson (966 yards) likely will become the sixth. . . . 
Peterson (15 touchdowns on 59 completions) averages one touchdown every 3.9 
completions. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Simi Valley players have caught at least one pass.

EL TORO KEYS ON STONE, BEATS THOUSAND OAKS TO ADVANCE IN PLAYOFFS

<P>
It's not often a coach will attack one of the opposing team's best players. But 
that's exactly what El Toro assistant coach Kim Jagd suggested the Chargers do 
to Thousand Oaks' Aimee Stone. 
</P>
<P>
And it worked like a charm. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (18-3) overcame an opening-game loss to the Lancers (18-4) and rallied 
to win 12-15, 15-5, 15-7, 15-10 and advance to the Southern Section 5A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were picking up what they did offensively and my wife (assistant coach Kim 
Jagd) figured out that No. 4 (Stone) had a lot of offensive responsibility," El 
Toro head coach Mike Jagd said. "So we served at her hoping making the passes 
and still hitting would put pressure on her.' 
</P>
<P>
It worked as Stone had trouble handling the serves, forced bad passes, and had 
trouble with kills as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It really takes me time to adjust to things," said Stone, who finished the 
game with 14 kills and five digs. "I'll hit 20 kills the same way before I 
adjust. I've got to, or should have learned that." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, ranked second in the final section poll, were led by Michelle 
Mauney, who had 14 kills, 10 blocks, 13 digs and four aces. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

Sal Tauau and Candis Carper, key components in the Channel Islands High girls' 
basketball team's drive to a share of the Marmonte League championship last 
season, have orally committed to Cal State Long Beach and Arizona State, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior last season Tauau, a 6-foot center, averaged 12.5 rebounds, 11.2 
assists and 2.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Carper, a 5-11 forward, averaged 14.2 points, 3.4 steals, 9.4 rebounds and 2.5 
blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tauau, who would like to go into law enforcement, said she chose Long Beach 
over Loyola Marymount and Cal because of proximity and the school's 
criminal-justice program. She planned to sign a letter of intent today during 
the NCAA early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was 25-9 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division I 
playoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carper, who was recruited by 25 Division I schools, chose Arizona State on the 
basis of its pre-law undergraduate program. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands finished 23-7 last season and advanced to the Southern Section 
5-AA Division semifinals. KIRBY LEE

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MAKING IMPORTANT GAINS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: MICHAEL BLACK IS USING HIS SENTENCE AT CAMP KILPATRICK TO 
DEVELOP AS A RUNNING BACK -- AND AS A RESPONSIBLE PERSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Camp Kilpatrick football coach likes to tell his players that sports are a 
microcosm of life, that teamwork begets success. . . . about the importance of 
structure, execution and playing by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The coach also says the world is like a series of trap plays, wherein suckers 
go for the easy bait and only the real dummies bite the second time around. If 
they get a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports are indicative of society," says Coach Sean Porter, an L. A. County 
probation officer. "Whether it's drugs or whatever you see wrong out there, it 
shows up eventually in sports." 
</P>
<P>
At age 16, Michael Black is living proof that Porter isn't spouting platitudes, 
although Black has the sequence a little backward. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Black was a restless student at Dorsey High. Soon thereafter, he 
found himself in hot water with the law. In May, he was sentenced to the youth 
correctional institution at Camp Kilpatrick, located in the hills east of 
Malibu (Because Black is a minor, the nature of his crime is not being 
divulged.) 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, after a three-year layoff from football, he is setting school 
rushing records and trying to turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
Black, a junior tailback, rushed for 324 yards in 16 carries and scored six 
touchdowns to lead Camp Kilpatrick to a 48-8 victory over St. John's last week 
at Beaumont High. Yet there was no postgame dance, no hugs from adoring fans, 
no yelps from cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Black got on the team bus and thanked his linemen. A few hours 
later, the bus drove into a fenced compound and Black and his teammates settled 
into a long night's sleep in a darkened dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Kilpatrick is a county-maintained youth correctional facility for boys 
aged 13-18 that Porter says is often "the last stop before the California Youth 
Authority" for many of the interned. "Almost all the kids here have prior 
convictions," Porter said. "Or if it was a first-time offense, it was pretty 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Black (5-foot-10, 174 pounds) swears his was a last-time offense. From now on, 
when anybody asks about his offense, he wants only to discuss the 1,184 yards 
and 20 touchdowns that he has racked up, or about how his 324 yards is the most 
gained by an area Southern Section back this season. 
</P>
<P>
His record? Let's talk plural, please. He set two single-game school marks 
against St. John's, for rushing yardage and touchdowns scored. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first and last place," said Black, who is scheduled to be released 
in December. "I won't be back." 
</P>
<P>
If life's a trap play, then Black has pulled off a double reverse. In fact, if 
he hadn't been incarcerated, he might not have started playing football again. 
</P>
<P>
Black said he last played at the Pop Warner level when he was 13, as a 
defensive back and receiver. As a sophomore last year at Dorsey, he didn't try 
out for the team. He plans to change that in 1991 after he re-registers at 
Dorsey next month. 
</P>
<P>
His metamorphosis at Camp Kilpatrick has been dramatic, Porter said. At Dorsey, 
Black admitted that he was an academic underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
"I got Cs, a few Ds and a couple of fails," said Black, who has run 40 yards in 
4.5 seconds. "I was lazy. I just wanted to watch TV and go outside." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he dreams of being outside. And next time, things will be different. 
Porter said that Black has been a B student since arriving at Camp Kilpatrick 
and seems to have his priorities in line. "If we do good in the dorm, then we 
do good in school," Black said. "If we do good in school, then we take it to 
the field. But the football field is the last thing." 
</P>
<P>
Black's emergence is only marginally more surprising than that of the team. In 
1989, Camp Kilpatrick competed at the Southern Section eight-man level. This 
season, the Mustangs (6-3-1 overall) were moved to Division X and 11-man ball. 
After a so-so start, Camp Kilpatrick has gone 4-1 in its last five games to 
earn a Freedom League co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Kilpatrick will play Rosamond in a first-round playoff game Friday night 
at 7:30 at Monroe High. 
</P>
<P>
"I pick them and Western Christian to make it to the semis in that bracket," 
said Village Christian Coach Mike Plaisance, whose team tied Camp Kilpatrick, 
14-14, in a nonleague game seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the constraints involved in building the Mustang program, that is 
quite an endorsement. For instance, Porter says that Camp Kilpatrick has never 
had a returning player. 
</P>
<P>
The average stay at the camp runs from six to nine months, whereupon players 
are sent back to school. Often, players don't arrive until the season has 
started or leave before it ends. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a kid here right now who might be better than Michael, but he got here 
late," said Porter, who grew up in Thousand Oaks and played football at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
The team bloomed late too, and for good reason. Of the Mustangs' first five 
opponents, four were ranked in the preseason top 10 in their divisions. Never 
mind that few of the Camp Kilpatrick players knew one another or had ever 
played at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Mustangs play no home games -- there is no football facility 
at Camp Kilpatrick and the team practices on a softball field -- and there are 
few fans to support the team on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure many teams would want to come here to play, anyway," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
Discipline is paramount. Players who violate even the smallest school rule are 
not allowed to play -- a major penalty since those who are suspended remain 
behind at the compound. But the camp's hard-line stance seems effective. 
</P>
<P>
"They all were good kids," Plaisance said. "You'd expect them to be 
undisciplined, but that wasn't the case. I really enjoyed talking to them after 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Talking and counseling are practically full-time jobs. Sometimes, teaching the 
game is the least important of Porter's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamics are strange," Porter said. "The kids don't trust each other, then 
they have to learn to confide and depend on each other. 
</P>
<P>
"As they grow together, they mature and grow as individuals. . . . We're not 
here to build a football team, we're here to instill character and build young 
men's lives." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are in the players' favor. Porter said the Camp Kilpatrick recidivism 
rate -- the number of those who again run afoul of the law upon their release 
-- is approximately 70%. The rate for those involved in the Mustang athletic 
program has been halved to 35%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Black has seen how the other half lives and says he wants no part of it. An 
older brother is in county jail and facing a lengthy prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't be coming home for a long, long time," Black said. "My mom said he 
might get life."

HOMEFED'S RATING DOWNGRADED; $110 MILLION IN DEBT AFFECTED; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE MOVE IS A REACTION TO CONCERNS ABOUT REAL ESTATE AND NONPERFORMING 
LOANS.

Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded HomeFed Bank's subordinated 
debt and deposit ratings, a move that affected about $110 million of long-term 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's linked the rating downgradings to an increase in foreclosed commercial 
real estate and nonperforming loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed by the downgrade," HomeFed spokeswoman Kaye Rowan said 
Tuesday. "But we understand that the purpose of these (ratings) agencies is to 
be conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Moody's expects that HomeFed, like most of California's major financial 
institutions, will experience further deterioration in the quality of its real 
estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Any additional deterioration could force the S&amp;L to take additional 
reserves, a move that would further reduce the S&amp;L's profitability, 
according to Moody's. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's downgraded HomeFed's ratings for long-term deposits to B-1 from BA-2. 
Moody's downgraded the thrift's rating for subordinated debt to CAA from B-1. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's, which on Tuesday also downgraded debt and deposit ratings for Coast 
Federal Bank, recently had downgraded ratings for several other large 
California financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Stock in HomeFed Corp., the parent company of HomeFed Bank, closed up $.25 at 
$6.625 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's stock has drifted up in recent days following word that a group 
led by Idanta Partners, a La Jolla investment group, had acquired 7.2% of 
HomeFed Corp.'s shares. HomeFed had traded at $5 or less immediately before the 
Idanta group's investment became public. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta founder and general partner David J. Dunn has described his group's 
investment in HomeFed as a "long-term" venture. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, in a recent interview, said he does not foresee an immediate turnaround 
in California's sluggish real estate market.

MILKEN TELLS JUDGE HE DIDN'T SEEK FAME; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: IN AN EMOTIONAL LETTER ASKING FOR LENIENCY, HE SAYS HE FEARS GOING 
TO JAIL.

<P>
Michael Milken, in an emotional plea for leniency, has told a federal judge he 
"never sought notoriety" and was afraid of going to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I could do anything that would result in being a felon . . . 
but I did break the law. . . . I have no one to blame but myself," Milken said 
in a letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. The 11-page letter, dated Nov. 
5, was made public by the judge late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All people, I am sure, have a fear of incarceration and separation," Milken 
said. "I am not unique, and I too have those fears." 
</P>
<P>
He said he wrote the letter because he feels that he would be too emotional 
during his sentencing hearing to adequately express his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond 
department, pleaded guilty in April to six securities felonies. He faces a 
possible maximum sentence of 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he asked that he be allowed to use his skills to help children, 
pointing out that he has spent the past few years working with inner-city 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his reputation as a financial wizard, Milken is also known as a 
generous philanthropist, having donated millions to charities and worked 
personally with underprivileged youth. 
</P>
<P>
Although Milken was probably the most powerful and influential financier 
through the merger-crazy 1980s, he remains an unassuming family man who broke 
down in tears when he publicly admitted his guilt in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he asked Wood to let him return to his quiet life. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who I don't even know, whom I've never met, who call me a symbol of 
the 1980s or a symbol of money and power, I say I've never sought notoriety," 
he wrote. "Let me return to a life of anonymity if humanly possible for myself 
and my family." 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the most painful experiences during the past four years has 
been "the assault on the sincerity of my beliefs, my moral system and my basic 
inner being." 
</P>
<P>
"I have been forced to face the challenge that not only am I portrayed as a 
fraud, but everything my life stood for is called a fraud and all the 
principles I have spoken about my whole life are hollow. At times, this has 
been almost too difficult to bear." 
</P>
<P>
Wood had previously said that Milken would be sentenced this week. However, as 
of late Tuesday no date had been set.

22 OF FURNISHING 2000 STORES WILL OPEN FOR 3-MONTH LIQUIDATION SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Furnishings 2000, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in September, will 
reopen 22 of its 31 stores in California on Saturday for a three-month 
liquidation sale. When the sale is completed in February, the troubled 
furniture retailer will close all its stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Mira Loma-based furniture store chain owes an estimated $20 million to $30 
million to creditors, including about $1.2 million to customers who made down 
payments on furniture never delivered, said Don Vesey, a Northern California 
mattress manufacturer who serves as chairman of Furnishings 2000's creditors' 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Initial proceeds of the liquidation sale, expected to gross about $40 million, 
will be used to "take care of consumers" who made those down payments, Vesey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric Credit Corp. is Furnishing 2000's only secured creditor, with 
a $6.5-million claim, Vesey said. Its other creditors are mainly wholesalers 
and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of inventory constraints, Furnishings 2000 won't be able to supply 
every customer with specific merchandise ordered before the stores entered 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings 2000 on Tuesday began sending letters to customers with down 
payments on undelivered furniture. Customers who don't receive letters should 
seek assistance at a nearby store, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings 2000 stores in Puente Hills, San Bernardino, Lancaster, Corona, 
Artesia, Anaheim, Redondo Beach, West Los Angeles and Van Nuys will reopen 
Saturday for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, Furnishings 2000 will reopen stores in El Cajon and the 
Clairemont area of San Diego. Stores in Bakersfield, Chula Vista, Downey, 
Glendale, Orange, San Marcos, Santa Ana, Upland, Venture and West Covina will 
not reopen for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, 11 stores will reopen Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Furnishings 2000 will close all its remaining Southern California 
stores when the sale ends in February, its 11 Northern California stores will 
remain open indefinitely, with profits earmarked for unsecured creditors whose 
debts are not covered by profits from the liquidation sale, Vesey said.

HOME SUPPLY UP; PRICES REMAIN LEVEL

San Diego County housing prices continue to be flat, while the supply of unsold 
units keeps piling up, a real estate brokerage group said Tuesday. Economic 
uncertainty and growing signs of a recession are being blamed by industry 
officials for the local market's increasing sluggishness. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of an existing or resold San Diego-area house in October was 
$210,711 -- -- about $100 less than the average price in October, 1989, 
according to a survey released Tuesday by the San Diego Board of Realtors. The 
trade group's survey is of member-brokered deals in San Diego, Chula Vista, La 
Mesa, El Cajon and National City. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of the county's new housing are similarly flat. A new, single-family, 
detached house sold for an average price of $258,000 over the three months 
ended Sept. 30, up from $250,000 for the corresponding three months in 1989, 
said Russell Valone, president of Market Profiles of San Diego, a housing 
market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a new condominium dropped to $168,000 during the third quarter, 
from $170,000 over the corresponding period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lower demand caused the supply of unsold existing houses in the San Diego area 
to jump to 14,000 in October, a 54% increase over the inventory at the same 
time last year, according to the Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The total of new unsold units in the county's subdivisions totaled 4,000 houses 
and condos by the end of September, more than double the 1,900-unit total at 
the same time last year, Valone said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the unsold housing inventory still does not constitute a glut, Valone 
said, adding that last year's market was "undersupplied." And, with 
construction slowing because of the lack of construction financing, the local 
housing market could face a shortage next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now is a good time to be looking for a new house," Valone said. "We 
could be short of product next year." 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages now carry interest rates of 10.25%.

hospitals, Tuesday announced a change of titles among its top management. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Conte, an executive vice president and son of James W. Conte, the 
company's chairman and chief executive, was promoted to president of all of the 
company's operations other than its U.S. Hospital Division. 
</P>
<P>
Loren B. Shook, also an executive vice president, was named president of the 
hospital division. Both appointments will become effective Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
While giving up the title of president, James W. Conte will remain CPC's 
chairman and chief executive. CPC assistant treasurer Pam Huffman said the

JACK SMITH: ROLE AS GOURMET COOK LEAVES A SOUR TASTE FOR READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disappointed in the response to my column about preparing a gourmet dinner 
for my wife and me. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped at least to be commended for trying, but I find myself harshly 
criticized for my choice of a recipe, my dependence on my wife for assistance, 
my uncertainty about what to do with the dishes and the dirty frying pan, and 
even for a lapse of memory. 
</P>
<P>
The lapse of memory is the easiest to dispense with. In giving the menu, I 
wrote, accurately, that the main ingredient was to be lamb chops. Later, 
however, I said that "all I had to buy was the pork chops." 
</P>
<P>
Now even though I could not tell lamb chops from pork chops in the market, I 
ought to be able to tell one from the other when they are merely words. This 
error, I believe, reflects more on my incompetence as a cook than as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is not nearly as gross as an error I committed later in writing 
about UFOs. It came to light when my wife and I were having breakfast. That is 
to say I was leaning over the electric range drinking decaf and reading Metro 
and she was leaning over the sink drinking decaf and reading View. 
</P>
<P>
She said, "You made a double negative." 
</P>
<P>
"What was it?" I said, knowing not to argue with her about grammar. 
</P>
<P>
"You said, 'And who can deny that some unearthly civilization is not advanced 
enough to seek us out?"' 
</P>
<P>
I am given to negative statements, and am always in danger of unwittingly 
doubling up on them. What I meant to say, of course, was "And who can deny that 
some unearthly civilization is advanced enough to seek us out?" 
</P>
<P>
But I was playing the devil's advocate. In fact, I do deny that some unearthly 
civilization is advanced enough to seek us out. In writing that sentence I 
unconsciously expressed my own convictions, that no unearthly civilization is 
advanced enough to seek us out. What I should have written was "And who can not 
deny that some unearthly civilization is not advanced enough to seek us out?" 
But in the end it don't make no difference. 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I was taken aback by some readers' comments on my cooking. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely you were jesting about making such a big deal about cooking dinner for 
your wife," wrote Florence Glick of Pasadena. "I am glad she got out the 
oregano, pepper, sour cream and olive oil for you. How helpless can you be?" 
</P>
<P>
That is easily explained. My wife knows where those things are. I don't. Why 
should I go hunting for them when she could find them in a jiffy? Besides, my 
purpose in cooking the dinner was not to show that I could do it without her 
help, but that we could work together. 
</P>
<P>
"After your dinner," Glick goes on, "you asked your wife, 'What should I do 
with the plates?' Had it been me I would have broken them on your head." 
</P>
<P>
And thus, of course, ruined the point of the whole experiment. What I was 
seeking to do was not to dominate, but to establish a level of cooperation. In 
asking what I should do with the plates, I was not trying to get out of washing 
them, but merely asking for guidance in the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"If that wasn't bad enough," Glick continues, "you didn't know what to do with 
the frying pan so you left it for her to wash. Give me strength." 
</P>
<P>
I did not leave the frying pan for my wife to wash. I just left it. What 
happened to it I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
My critics were not all women. Irving Kellogg of Beverly Hills castigated me 
for what he considered disloyalty to his sex. "Fie on you, Mr. Smith. You are a 
renegade, and such other words as mean that you have betrayed your maleness. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
It is exactly that attitude that I was trying to escape. I challenge Mr. 
Kellogg to put on an apron and try taking on the culinary responsibilities 
himself. I warn him, however, against attempting to serve gjetost with his 
meat, whether lamb chops or pork chops. As several readers have warned me, too 
late, gjetost is a Norwegian goat cheese. It is about the color of caramel and 
the consistency (in its viscous form) of peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't put gjetost sauce on lamb chops or anything else," warns Joan 
(Dusty) Bouchelle of Mission Viejo. "It takes a great deal of getting used to 
if you didn't happen to grow up with it. I'm sure the author of your wife's 
cookbook meant well, or maybe just meant to come up with something different, 
but don't be hornswoggled." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's too late. We had the gjetost sauce. It tasted something like 
butterscotch yogurt. I can't say it was good with the lamb chops, but then I'm 
not even sure they were lamb chops.

Benefit Basics 
</P>

Friends and supporters of the Mental Health Assn. of Orange County met Saturday 
for a gourmet dinner and auction at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
The event raised $36,000 for practical assistance and counseling services for 
the mentally ill homeless and other "psychiatrically impaired" low-income 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
The Program 
</P>
<P>
The group calls its annual party a "Wine and Travel Auction," and this year's 
invitation -- designed to look like a U.S. passport -- was a ticket to ride. 
For $100 per person, guests cruised through a champagne reception and silent 
auction bidding, an elegant dinner of shrimp ravioli with sun-dried tomatoes 
and roast chicken with black truffle sauce, and a live auction followed by 
dancing to The Home Savings Band of America. (Any guess who sponsored the 
music?) True to the evening's billing, the 150 auction items included cases of 
premium wines and more than two dozen weekend getaways. The top draw was a 
London trip for two, nabbed by Andrea and Mike Goode for $6,000 in the 
after-dinner live auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Cause 
</P>
<P>
Although the sumptuous surroundings and fancy food were nice extras, the reason 
for the fund-raiser was clear to all those attending. In fact, it was right 
there on the invitations: An asterisk by the ticket price led to a footnote 
reading, "Actual ticket value per person is $43. Contribution to MHA is $57." 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old nonprofit organization sponsors direct aid and client advocacy 
programs aimed at improving the day-to-day existence of the mentally ill 
homeless. As guests learned from a 15-minute video shown before dinner, recent 
studies have indicated that "up to 50% of the homeless suffer from some clearly 
defined psychiatric disorder," such as manic-depression or schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
Programs benefiting from the evening include the Lighthouse, MHA's daytime 
shelter in Santa Ana, which provides food, clothing, laundry and shower 
facilities, vocational rehabilitation and skills training sessions; a 
countywide network of self-help groups; community education programs; and civil 
rights, residential and legislative advocacy programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bouchard, homeless programs coordinator, said he's seen a "definite 
increase" in numbers of clients at the shelter in the two years he has worked 
with MHA. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the problem is there's been a lot of cuts" from federal, state and 
local budgets, Bouchard said, "but I think it's also that more people are 
willing to seek help." 
</P>
<P>
Faces 
</P>
<P>
The dinner party was chaired by Gene Andres. Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley was honorary chairman of the event. Among guests were John Garrett, 
executive director of MHA, and his wife, Celinda; Monte Buchsbaum, head of the 
UC Irvine Brain Imaging Department; Claire and Mac Burt; Sandy and Allan 
Fainbarg; Caroll Yap and John Dedischew; Marilyn and John Coll, and Ellen Bak 
Gaughan and Mark Gaughan. PAMELA MARIN

METRO RAIL COST ESTIMATES JUMP BY $338 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: ADDED TO A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OVERRUN OF $135 MILLION, THE 
TOTAL ESCALATION HAS NOW REACHED $473 MILLION.

Cost estimates for building the 17.4-mile Metro Rail subway project have 
escalated by $473 million and Los Angeles transit officials now put the total 
at $3.9 billion, a California Transportation Commission official told The Times 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A $135-million cost overrun had been previously reported. But Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission officials have informed the state that the 
costs will go up an additional $338 million as a result of federal funding 
delays, according to Robert Chung, deputy director of the state Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Department of Transportation is providing more than 40% of the 
funding for the downtown subway, but the county commission said that delays in 
reaching a funding agreement have set the project back at least a year, thereby 
increasing construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bohlinger, a top fiscal planner for the county commission, said the cost 
increases were presented to state officials in April. She said the federal 
government is being asked to pick up $170 million of the cost overrun. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Metro Rail cost escalations was brought up during a state 
Assembly Transportation Committee hearing Tuesday in Los Angeles that was 
called to examine the cost of developing a 300-mile rail transit system in 
Southern California. The state is funding part of this development. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, state officials testified they had been told last March 
that the cost of building the subway was increasing. The state had asked the 
county for a detailed cost breakdown, but never received a reply, said Robert 
I. Remen, executive director of the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
The state was seeking the cost per passenger mile of building Metro Rail, a 
subway linking downtown Los Angeles with North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) asked 
Richard Stanger, the county's director of rail development, to explain why the 
county had not supplied the state with the cost figures. Stanger said he could 
not explain why, but promised to get the figures as soon as he could. 
</P>
<P>
"I want those numbers by the close of business Friday," Katz ordered. 
</P>
<P>
He accused the commission of stalling and using "a shell game" to obscure the 
cost increases. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview after Tuesday's hearing, Chung explained that the 
county commission had provided broad cost overrun figures in a report filed 
with the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1990 LACTC financial plan for the Metro Red Line has increased $473 
million over the plan presented to the (state commission) in 1989," the April 
26, 1990, report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
It stated that the added costs were due in large part to a yearlong delay by 
federal officials in signing a funding agreement on the second phase of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, federal officials are requiring the commission to build the next 
13 miles of the subway project in two stages, instead of one long project. 
County transit experts said this was less efficient and would delay completion 
of the project by another year or more. The subway now is scheduled to reach 
North Hollywood by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Some delays have been caused by the conflict between the county commission and 
the Southern California Rapid Transit District, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD was responsible for constructing the 4.4-mile first phase under 
downtown Los Angeles. But the commission stepped in and took over the project 
in July after audits revealed a $135-million cost overrun. The first phase of 
the project is two years behind schedule and will not open until the fall of 
1993.

METRO RAIL EXCAVATION CASTS NEW LIGHT ON 'OLD CHINATOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles' long-vanished "Old Chinatown" -- razed to make room for Union 
Station more than half a century ago -- is revealing some of its secrets to 
urban archeologists now poring over a cache of artifacts unearthed during Metro 
Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
The finds range from the ordinary to the exquisite: a portable cooking stove; 
porcelain tea cups, rice bowls and spittoons; a woman's high-laced leather 
shoe; rusted Chinese coins; gambling dominoes and opium pipe bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of objects, left behind 52 years ago when most of Los Angeles' first 
Chinatown was bulldozed to make way for the station, are providing experts with 
a detailed look at the life, habits -- even the diets -- of early Chinese 
railroad workers, vegetable peddlers, merchants and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The area excavated represents about one-quarter of Old Chinatown, 12 square 
blocks whose earliest residents, mostly railroad workers, arrived in the 1870s. 
In its heyday, the area was a thriving business and residential district 
inhabited by 3,000 Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
The excavation project -- begun last year and set to conclude later this year 
when all the items are dated and analyzed -- will help scholars better 
understand early Chinese-American history, said William Mason, a curator at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, which may become the artifacts' 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
The result may be a toppling of popularly held stereotypes: that there were few 
women in Old Chinatown (most of the early immigrants were thought to be men who 
didn't bring their families), that opium-smoking and gambling led to the 
community's demise, that everyone who lived there belonged to one socioeconomic 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"Where often it is said there were no women in Chinatown, we have proven that's 
not true," said Roberta S. Greenwood, an urban archeologist whose firm won a 
$240,945 contract from the Southern California Rapid Transit District to 
monitor digs for artifacts uprooted by Metro Rail construction. "We found 
women's jewelry, shoes, beads. Even after the Exclusion Act (an 1882 federal 
law designed to keep out Chinese immigrants), professionals and merchants were 
allowed to bring families." 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that what the archeologists didn't find is just as interesting as 
what they did. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper articles during the area's heyday in the early 1900s described 
underground passageways leading from building to building, which the Chinese 
supposedly would use as opium dens, gambling parlors or hideaways during tong 
wars -- clashes between secretive Chinese associations. But Greenwood said she 
found no evidence of such tunnels under Union Station, although one has been 
discovered under a nearby brick building. 
</P>
<P>
Mason believes there never was a massive network of tunnels. He said the 
newspaper accounts were used as "scare propaganda. People were violently 
anti-Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
The artifacts also suggest a diverse social structure in Old Chinatown -- 
"everything from teachers to fortunetellers," Greenwood said. Most of the 
jewelry found under Union Station was "imitation jade" -- colored glass 
bracelets and beads made to look like the precious stone that was too expensive 
for most working-class Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Yet lying nearby were vases made of fine quality porcelain -- some expensively 
glazed -- that more likely belonged to a wealthy merchant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was said that the Chinese community was . . . monolithic," Greenwood said. 
"I don't believe that for a minute. There was quite a range of occupations." 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries were made when archeologists, using old fire insurance maps as 
a guide, spent three weeks last year exploring an area east of Alameda Street. 
Metro Rail work crews at the site had removed 14 feet of soil to begin 
construction on the first stop of the 17.4-mile Red Line. There, just as 
expected, were the brick remains of old Chinese settlements, vegetable stalls 
and open trash pits. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very exciting," said Suellen Cheng, a Los Angeles historian specializing 
in Chinese-American history who was consulted during the excavation. "We have 
been talking about the history, but it was only words. Now we can see the real 
objects. It's a much more vivid history with the support of the artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
Most residents of Old Chinatown lived in cramped quarters -- whole families 
lived in the back of a store, while bachelors crowded into poorly lit boarding 
houses with little heat or ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of laws preventing Chinese from owning property, most early immigrants 
paid rent to the family of rancher Juan Apablasa, who owned most of Old 
Chinatown. By 1913, the family was taking in $4,000 a month from Chinese 
tenants, according to a June, 1949, account in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
After being displaced by Union Station construction during the 1930s, most 
Chinese pooled their money, gathered their belongings and resettled a few 
blocks northwest in the area known today as Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood, who was first hired in 1974 by state and local agencies to excavate 
Chinatowns and Chinese gold-mining camps in California, said the Union Station 
discovery is by far the largest she's come across. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Chinatown finds are not the only discoveries unearthed by Metro Rail 
digging. Other sites have yielded fossils dating back millions of years, said 
Bruce Lander, a North Hollywood paleontologist on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinatown collection is being stored temporarily at RTD headquarters, but 
may be permanently displayed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History or at Metro Rail stations. Meanwhile, Chinese community leaders are 
pushing for a new Museum of Chinese-American History to house the collection. 
</P>
<P>
News of the excavation of Old Chinatown has traveled quickly through the 
Chinese community, sparking memories -- both painful and pleasant -- for some 
men and women alive during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very isolated," said David Lee, 71, whose family owned Man Jen Low, a 
three-story restaurant in Old Chinatown. "We were not able to go to public 
swimming pools. There was one day when blacks and Asians were allowed." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee also recalled times when he and other youngsters would hide inside 
stables where vegetable peddlers kept their horses, carts and produce. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd crawl underneath and steal fruits," he chuckled. "We wore coveralls with 
big pockets to put all the fruit in. . . . We had a colony of our own."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARCHDIOCESE TO ENROLL GIRLS AT CANTWELL 
HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwindling enrollment has forced the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles 
to begin allowing girls to enroll next September at Cantwell High School, a 
44-year-old all-boys school in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell will consolidate with nearby Sacred Heart of Mary, a privately owned 
all-girls Catholic school across the street that will close, said Bill Rivera, 
a spokesman for the archdiocese. The new school will be called Cantwell-Sacred 
Heart of Mary High School. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell's enrollment has dropped about 50% over the last five years. Sacred 
Heart of Mary's policy of keeping tuition costs low to allow more students to 
attend school was creating increasing financial burdens, administrators said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUTCRY PROMPTS LYNWOOD TO SCALE BACK 
UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lynwood City Council has decided to scale back a new utility tax after 
being deluged with complaints from angry residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 Monday to enact a 3% tax on gas, telephone and 
electric bills, effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The council initially had approved a 10% tax, but opted for the lower rate 
after angry residents packed the council chambers last week to protest the tax. 
The 3% tax is expected to increase residents' total utility bills an average of 
$35 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The new tax is expected to generate more than $1 million next year to help pay 
for such services as street and sewer repairs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the 10% tax on Oct. 30 to avoid restrictions of 
Proposition 136, which would have required cities to obtain voter approval 
before raising taxes. The proposition, however, was defeated last week.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: K MART EMPLOYEE SHOT IN HOLDUP BY 2 GUNMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An assistant manager of a K mart store in South-Central Los Angeles was 
slightly wounded Tuesday morning when two gunmen forced their way into the 
store's vault and took an undisclosed amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Gary Brennan said the gunmen entered the store at 
Vermont and Slauson avenues when it opened at 9 a.m., overpowered two security 
guards, tied them up and ordered an assistant manager to open the store's 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
After the pair took the money, one of them fired a shot at the assistant 
manager, nicking him in the neck, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, believing the gunmen were still inside the store, sealed off the area 
and conducted a two-hour search, but the pair escaped, Brennan said. K mart 
officials declined comment on the incident.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASH CAME FROM SELLING OLD CARS, DEPUTY 
TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors sparred with defense witnesses Tuesday in the 
money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, accusing 
one officer of failing to account for tens of thousands of dollars in cash that 
he spent on cars, helicopter lessons and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Denying that he had received any stolen cash, Deputy James R. Bauder testified 
that he and his wife had managed to save more than $45,000 -- largely from 
refurbishing and selling cars, baby-sitting and collecting loose change around 
their house -- and kept the money at home. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors challenged Bauder's story and said the deputy failed to explain 
another $35,000 in cash that prosecutors contend is linked to stolen drug 
money. Bauder and six other sheriff's narcotics officers are on trial in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles on charges that they skimmed $1.4 million from 
drug dealers and spent the money on cars, boats and other luxuries.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN TICKET-FIXING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An employee of the company that processes parking tickets for the city of Los 
Angeles pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to charges of 
attempting to fix parking citations. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Ellis, 32, a customer service representative for Lockheed Information 
Management Services Co., was charged with grand theft, commercial bribery and 
unlawful access to a computer, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
He allegedly offered to clear the record of a parking violator with unpaid 
tickets totaling over $1,000; the parking violator then contacted Los Angeles 
police, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City Parking Administrator Robert Yates said he was not aware of any previous

collect unpaid citations since 1985. City officials have been considering 
renewal of Lockheed's contract, which expired last month.

COUNTY DELAYS CUTTING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AMID PLEAS FOR SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: SUPERVISORS MAY SLASH $41.9 MILLION IN PROGRAMS UNLESS STATE AID COMES. 
PATIENTS AND CLINIC PERSONNEL SAY MORE HELP, NOT LESS, IS NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patients, clinic administrators and advocates for the mentally ill on Tuesday 
predicted mayhem and tragedy if the County Board of Supervisors goes through 
with $41.9 million in cuts to mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are wrestling with major budget shortfalls for mental and 
public health programs because of the failure of the Proposition 134 liquor 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Action on the mental health cuts was postponed until next Tuesday to allow more 
time to obtain a promise of a bailout from governor-elect Pete Wilson. The 
supervisors also set Dec. 15 for a legally mandated hearing on the impact of 
the proposed $12.7 million in cuts to outpatient services at county hospitals 
and health centers. 
</P>
<P>
Without additional money and with no cuts in services, the mental health budget 
will run out in April. The latest plan of county mental health Director Roberto 
Quiroz calls for dropping 22,000 of the 69,000 people in outpatient programs, 
closing 10 county clinics and converting the five that remain to crisis centers 
for the most seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically what we are saying is that we will no longer have walk-in outpatient 
clinics operated by the county," Quiroz said. 
</P>
<P>
One that would be closed is Hollywood Mental Health Service, serving 1,700 
patients. The threat of its closure drove Ina Kleinberg, 61, of West Los 
Angeles to join a demonstration in front of the Hall of Administration on 
Tuesday just before the supervisors met. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 protesters circled the plaza in front of the building at 500 W. 
Temple St., carrying placards with such slogans as "Mental Health or More 
Police" and "Share the Wealth With Mental Health." 
</P>
<P>
Kleinberg and her husband care for their 36-year-old daughter, who is 
schizophrenic and manic-depressive. -The family receives care from several 
sources, but Kleinberg said she also has needed help in coping with the stress 
that mental illness has brought on the family. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a haven at Hollywood Mental Health in the once-a-week family group," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the supervisors' meeting, Marvel Rolfe sat before the microphone to 
plead for Hollywood Mental Health. A psychiatric nurse there for 12 years, she 
spoke of tending to patients who are the most disabled among the county's 
mentally ill, and of what she sees as the impact of today's deteriorating 
economy, growing unemployment and money woes on mental health in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need more cuts, we need more services," Rolfe said, near tears. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Lodwig Brand, president of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies, 
representing 42 nonprofit mental health clinics under contract to the county, 
projected that 40,000 -- not 22,000 -- patients will be dropped from care if 
the cuts go through. 
</P>
<P>
"They have got to come up with the money," Brand said in an interview. "You 
have a system that has been in development for 50 to 60 years that will go 
under with these cuts, and you won't be able to bring it back by adding more 
money next year." 
</P>
<P>
In postponing a decision on the cuts, the supervisors said they were counting 
heavily on Wilson to restore state mental and public health money that Gov. 
George Deukmejian cut last summer to balance the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The board mailed a letter Nov. 8 to Wilson asking for an emergency meeting to 
discuss restoring the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The board has received no response. Bill Livingston, Wilson's press secretary, 
told The Times that he did not know if the letter has reached the transition 
team and that it was too early to make any budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors plan to send a similar letter to county legislators to get them 
involved in lobbying Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, an advocate of additional funding, said he did not want 
the board to stop with Wilson, but to explore the possibility of new taxes or 
funds from other departments. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Richard Simon and Carl Ingram contributed to this story.

SEND YOUR DONATIONS TO CITY HALL;

<P>
TIMES SERIES RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT PAST BRADLEY FUND RAISINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent Times investigation into the fund-raising practices of Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley provides more sobering evidence -- as if any were needed -- 
of the corrupting influence money has on government. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of reports based on internal campaign documents obtained by The 
Times -- with the help of a court order -- reporters Rich Connell and Tracy 
Wood detailed how mayoral aides and city commissioners raised $700,000 for 
three different Bradley campaigns over the last five years. Lots of that money 
came from contractors and lobbyists who had business pending with the city, 
often before the very same commissions on which sat the very same commissioners 
who solicited the campaign donations. Even if nothing illegal occurred, the 
coziness of those relationships raises questions. Were city commissioners 
judging projects and proposals on their merits, or on how much money their 
proponents had donated to the mayor? 
</P>
<P>
The reports also documented a City Hall campaign operation that was at best 
chaotic and, at worst, downright illegal. During two different Bradley 
campaigns for mayor, in 1985 and 1989, and his failed run at the California 
governorship in 1986, staff aides routinely did political work for Bradley on 
city time. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the series, Bradley and Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani point out that 
City Hall staffers were told to keep their official duties separate from their 
political activities. Fabiani also notes Bradley's strong support of the city's 
new political ethics ordinance, which specifically prohibits some of the 
campaign activities documented by The Times, as evidence that the mayor 
sincerely wants to clear up the ethical haze that hangs over City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, city voters can take some reassurance from the fact the ethics reforms 
they wisely enacted last June will make it somewhat harder for officials to 
engage in dubious fund raising in the future. But promises to do better don't 
excuse wrongdoing in the past, and there are some instances cited in the series 
that should be further investigated by the appropriate authorities, 
specifically some of the fund raising done by long-time Bradley aides. If 
Bradley aides or commissioners did anything illegal, they should be prosecuted 
and, at the very least, reimburse the city for any campaigning they did on 
public time or using public resources. That would send a clear message to 
everybody in City Hall -- not just the mayor's office -- that the old rules not 
only don't apply anymore but also that they can get you into a heap of trouble.

Kudos to Rockwell for his tongue-in-cheek parody of moronic 
anti-environmentalism, complete with pointedly brain-dead humor attempts and 
justifications for swelling our landfills with Styrofoam (not to mention raping 
the ozone layer). It was tongue in cheek, wasn't it?

HOLD THE DEBATE, THEN TAKE A VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
A SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS IS NEEDED ON IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before it adjourned last month, Congress, in an extraordinary action, passed a 
resolution giving its leaders the power to summon the membership back into 
session "whenever, in their opinion, the public interest shall warrant it." The 
public interest warrants such a step now. The congressional leadership should 
reconvene Congress for the specific purpose of debating and voting on a 
resolution approving the use of military force, if necessary, to deal with 
Iraqi aggression. If the leadership fails to act quickly, the President should 
recall Congress and put the same issue before it. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to reach at least a tentative accommodation on the vexing matter of 
whether Congress and the President are required to share power when it comes to 
committing the armed forces to war. The Constitution is far from being an 
illuminating guide on this matter, and its ambiguities have long fueled 
competitive claims between Congress and President. Congress is empowered to 
declare war and raise and support the armed forces. The President is given 
broad authority as commander-in-chief of those forces and as chief diplomat -- 
"the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole 
representative with foreign nations," as John Marshall said nearly two 
centuries ago. Who, then, has the determining voice in deciding when and where 
Americans might be sent into combat? The argument goes on. It is alternately 
passionate and contemplative, legalistic and practical. But it is also -- given 
the demonstrated reluctance of the courts to take up the issue -- probably 
ultimately unresolvable by the usual means. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Congress insist that they must be "consulted" before the President 
takes the nation into war. It has never been quite clear what "consultation" 
means. Wars can erupt very quickly, surprise is often of vital importance, and 
the first few hours of combat can be decisive. How far in advance is the 
President expected to seek the advice and consent of Congress -- of its senior 
leaders, if not of the entire 535-member body? And if circumstances have made 
military operations imminent, while Congress prefers to take time for 
reflection before giving the President its opinion, what then? Like the 
Constitution's enumeration of war powers, here, too, ambiguity prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Far less murky is Congress' claim to be much more closely in touch with the 
mood of the people than is the President. That is an important point, not least 
to those military leaders who concluded in the aftermath of Vietnam that 
consistent domestic support was vital to the success of future wars. Right now 
the intensity of public backing for U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf seems 
uncertain, in no small part because Bush has not clearly enough articulated its 
objectives. Granted, too much can be made of wide and deep public support as a 
necessary precondition. From the Revolution -- which John Adams calculated was 
backed by no more than one-third of the people -- through Vietnam, America's 
wars and their preludes have almost always provoked controversy and division. 
We are not a war-seeking people. All the more reason why the President must aim 
to build the broadest consensus for the contingency he faces. 
</P>
<P>
Let Congress reconvene, let the President and his advisers give the best 
justifications they can for possibly going to war, let the debate proceed, and 
then let an up-or-down vote be taken. Approval for the war option would not 
automatically make war inevitable; on the contrary, it could finally move 
Saddam Hussein to get out of Kuwait without a shot having to be fired. Nor 
would such a full-dress debate necessarily undercut the President's efforts to 
out-maneuver the resourceful and unprincipled Hussein; on the contrary, 
domestic debate of some kind is certain in any event. Congress demands to be 
"consulted." Here is its chance; let the leadership seize it.

ALL THAT COUNTS IS AN HONEST COUNT; 
</P>
<P>
ABSENTEE BALLOT SNAFU IN ORANGE COUNTY CLOUDS ATTORNEY GENERAL RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The absentee ballot has joined big money and television as a formidable weapon 
in California politics. The secretary of state's office estimates that 20% of 
voting in the recent election, an all-time high, was done by mail. It wasn't by 
accident. Both major parties, especially the Republicans through a statewide 
campaign, mobilized absentee voters. 
</P>
<P>
But what has happened this time in Orange County, long a bastion of Republican 
strength, illustrates that the system of verifying absentee ballot signatures 
is too loosely supervised and too open to manipulation, especially in a close 
election. 
</P>
<P>
A superior court judge last weekend took the unusual step of halting the 
absentee count, pending a hearing scheduled for Friday. Democrat Arlo Smith, 
locked in a bitterly contested and close race for state attorney general with 
Republican Dan Lungren, challenged the tabulating methods of the registrar of 
voters on the grounds that nobody was checking the authenticity of signatures 
on absentee ballot applications. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office permits registrars either to verify ballot 
signatures against original affidavits of registration or against the 
applications for ballots. Orange County's method of checking against original 
registration is typical of big counties. But the Smith camp has charged that 
GOP workers may have submitted applications illegally by forging signatures for 
real voters. 
</P>
<P>
If that had happened, a registrar's office like Orange County's, which does not 
check signatures on applications, would never catch meddling partisans. If the 
system is to have integrity, campaign workers should not be the equivalent of 
travel agents for voters. Absentee voters should submit their own applications. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, evident in Los Angeles County, must be resolved as the 
absentee ballot sweepstakes grow. There the number of absentee ballots received 
was huge -- actually exceeding the total vote in some states. But nearly 13,000 
were invalidated -- even though some bore local postmarks as early as Nov. 1 or 
2. It seems that the state Election Code says the delivery time, not the 
postmark, is what matters for a vote to count. Change the law so that the 
postmark, not the date received, counts. 
</P>
<P>
As more people vote by absentee ballot, and as campaigns gear up to attract 
those voters, the Legislature must ensure that: 1) Absentee voters submit their 
own applications; 2) ballots submitted on time are not discounted because the 
mail carrier is running late.

TOM CLANCY ON U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Something Worth Going to War For," by Tom Clancy (Commentary, 
Nov. 7): 
</P>
<P>
Clancy writes that economic security, which he identifies with oil in the 
Persian Gulf, is a vital interest. But, he continues, "principles are even more 
vital, for it is our principles that created our economy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Upon close inspection it is found that he offers only one such principle. 
</P>
<P>
It is: "It has been a principle of American policy for a long time that to 
tolerate aggression invites more aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The "principle" will not stand. It is self-defeating when applied to the gulf 
situation: If tolerating aggression invites more aggression, then the U.S. 
should have not supported Iraq's aggression in its war against Iran. According 
to the "principle," the U.S. encouraged the invasion of Kuwait when it supplied 
military intelligence and naval protection to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Minus the failed principle, Clancy's argument is roughly the same as the one he 
attacks in the beginning: " . . . We are there to preserve low oil prices." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy and others should cut out the nonsense. Of course a war would be for 
oil. If the Kuwaitis and Iraqis exported coconuts, would the U.S. have over 
240,000 troops on the ground in Saudi Arabia?

<TEXT>
<P>
Someone has said that there's no one so dangerous as a fanatic misapplying 
"principles." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy exemplifies in his own person the title of his novel "Clear and Present 
Danger." Reviewing U.S. history, he concludes that "more than anything else, 
America is a set of principles . . . the distillation of 10,000 years of human 
social evolution." This, after telling us that "The Mexican-American War was 
essentially a border dispute; Mexico couldn't even handle the Texans, much less 
all of America." Well, there's another border dispute in the Persian Gulf that 
may result in a similarly exaggerated outcome. No great power can cast the 
first stone against the aggressor. The policeman must be the United Nations.

MCDONALD'S WILL DO AWAY WITH FOAM BOXES

<P>
A big "McHooray" for McDonald's for its decision to use non-polystyrene 
containers! A huge "McBoo" for Llewellyn Rockwell for complaining that the new 
containers would not sop up his daughter's hamburger grease and would make his 
coffee cup too hot to hold ("Could McTofu Be Next?" Commentary, Nov. 7). 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's justification for Styrofoam use is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
He holds the view that landfills contain rocks, which biodegrade very slowly, 
so why not add plastic cups and other containers. 
</P>
<P>
Why not indeed! Where does he think landfills come from -- the air? They are 
developed in canyons and other lovely open spaces that are fast disappearing. 
He would probably be in favor of using the Grand Canyon as landfill. After all, 
it's certainly big enough! 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also fails to understand that Styrofoam is manufactured in a process 
that releases chlorofluorocarbon (a known destroyer of our ozone layer) out of 
materials that are non-renewable. What a wasteful use of a diminishing resource 
that is increasingly coming from foreign and highly unreliable sources. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic products may be here to stay, but using them in such wasteful forms as 
immediately disposable hamburger and coffee containers is shameless folly. 
Plastics should be used in more durable forms that will not find an immediate 
home in our fast vanishing landfills as a lasting testament to human 
shortsightedness.

Proposition 140 was a powerful demonstration of public frustration with policy 
gridlock at the state level. Its arbitrary and simplistic approach to limiting 
terms and cutting the Legislature's staff will not automatically improve the 
Legislature, but instead will create a revolving door of inexperience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The impact of Proposition 140 is also personal. 
</P>
<P>
Every Californian must now accept greater individual responsibility for making 
the system work. That means getting involved in their schools, cities and 
counties and, above all, going to the polls to elect the highest quality public 
leaders we can. Legislators won't have the time for on-the-job training -- they 
will have to hit the ground running. We can't expect to have a world-class 
education system with a second-rate Legislature.

PLAN TO BAN PET BREEDING DRAWS HOWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN MATEO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a plague of too many pets, officials in San Mateo County heard arguments 
Tuesday on a plan to ban breeding of all cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
During a raucous hearing lasting several hours, more than 300 people jeered and 
cheered remarks for and against the plan to impose zero pet population growth 
in the county, where 10,000 animals are put to death each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The message we're sending is, 'The killing must stop,' " said Kim Sturla, 
director of the Peninsula Humane Society, who testified for the plan during the 
hearing before the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Stern of the American Kennel Club advocated more public education for 
irresponsible pet owners instead of a moratorium on animal births. Most pet 
breeders in the audience took a similar stance. 
</P>
<P>
"All animal lovers abhor the needless destruction of animals," Stern said. "But 
this ordinance is a simplistic proposal that will alienate a group you need -- 
breeders." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Tom Nolan, who introduced the ordinance, said he expected it to be 
amended before any vote is taken in order to allow breeding of guide dogs for 
the blind and possibly to exempt professional breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got to do a little compromising before it will pass," said 
Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
Any proposed ordinance must be passed in two separate readings before it can go 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's proposed ordinance, thought to be the first of its kind in the nation, 
would apply to unincorporated areas in this affluent county of 600,000 south of 
San Francisco. As originally written, it calls for a one-year moratorium on 
breeding beginning Jan. 1 and then mandatory spaying and neutering of all cats 
and dogs older than 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
Violators would face fines from $100 to $500, but penalties would be waived if 
the animals were subsequently spayed or neutered.

WRIGHT HOPES TO PULL OFF A FAST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Wright, a gynecologist from Fresno, hopes to go party-crashing Saturday 
night at Los Alamitos with Jazzing Hi in the $125,000 Breeders Championship 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The Championship Classic, the highlight of eight stakes during Quarter Horse 
Breeders Classic Championship Day, has been billed as a showdown between 
champion females See Me Do It and Dash for Speed. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who owns the horse with breeder Wayne Charlton, went so far as to buy 
an advertisement in recent Los Alamitos programs, proclaiming: "Jazzin Hi is 
the fastest horse in the world. He will prove it in the Quarter Horse Breeders 
Championship on Nov. 17 at Los Alamitos." 
</P>
<P>
And he put his money where his mouth is, supplementing the 4-year-old son of 
Merridoc for $12,000 in the 440-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wins, it won't be an upset," Wright said. "He'll have dead aim on those 
ladies. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if they get too involved with each other, he's going to sneak by and 
get it. If I'm within three-quarters of a length with 200 yards to go, I'll win 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as raw-talented a horse as I've ever had," said Wright of the chestnut, 
who has four firsts and four seconds in 10 starts. He won the Vessels Maturity 
and finished second in the Los Alamitos Championship, a half-length behind Dash 
for Speed, during the summer meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He always has to come from behind," Wright said. "He was about two lengths 
behind the mare in seventh with 80 yards to go in the Championship and made up 
a length and a half. I watched the tape over and over again. I called (track 
announcer) Ed Burgart and asked if he had ever seen a horse move that fast. He 
said no. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee people will see the fastest horse in the world. I guarantee at the 
end he'll be catching the leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a former partner of Dr. Edward Allred -- now president and CEO of Los 
Alamitos -- in Long Beach, shifted his practice north 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought my first quarter horse in 1974," Wright said. "I bought Triple a Deck 
for $3,600 at the Pomona sale, he won his first race, and I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Wright enjoyed greater success as the co-owner of Charger Bar, a world 
champion, and The Black Alliance, a two-time divisional champion. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzing Hi is out of Anna High, a stakes-winning half-sister to Charger Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first male out of the Charger Bar line to do this well," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good stock from the start and just thought I was going to ride it 
forever," Wright said. "But I've been in kind of a drought the last six years. 
Somebody closed the door. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I've got Jazzing Hi and a nice 3-year-old half-brother to The Black 
Alliance named One Kilo Whiskey. I'm back!" 
</P>
<P>
As a final challenge, Wright has proposed a side bet with the owners of See Me 
Do It and Dash for Speed. 
</P>
<P>
"The winner keeps his (purse) money," he said. "The losers, if they finish 
second or third, donate their winnings to charity." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Daryn Charlton, 27, has been preparing Jazzing Hi for the last three 
weeks since the horse returned from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can stay within a half-length 200 yards away, we could pull an upset," 
Charlton said. "The mares are the ones to beat, but there are four or five in 
there who could win." 
</P>
<P>
Expected to join the three in the Classic are Heisajoy, Tee Roy Reb and Wicked 
Dash. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dream Doctor might have earned a spot in the $25,000 Breeders Sophomore 
Classic after scoring a two-length victory under Eddie Garcia Saturday in the 
$55,729 California Sires Cup Derby in :19.69, only :16 off Dash for Speed's 
track record for 400 yards. "I thought he ran a monster," said trainer H.J. 
Visscher after the gelding's fifth victory in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first runner owned by Kathy and Don Clift of Orange," Visscher 
said. "They claimed his dam, Proud Dream, and she broke down in that race, so 
they bred her. He had some problems with sickness at 2, and I got him unraced 
in January." 
</P>
<P>
Fans who bet Grammas Noisy Jet to place in the first race Saturday were the 
unluckiest of non-winners. Although she crossed the wire second, a head behind 
Formalities, Grammas Noisy Jet and Azure Baby Bandit, who was unplaced, were 
declared non-starters. Stewards flashed the inquiry sign immediately after the 
race and discovered that Gates 1 and 2, from which the pair broke, opened an 
instant late. Despite starting about a length behind, Grammas Noisy Jet, a 7-1 
shot, almost hit the wire first after being sixth. All money bet on the two 
horses was refunded.

Jockey Jim Lewis equaled a career-high four winners last Tuesday, scoring with 
Flow Control, Our Buddy, Little Doc Mason and Twaynas Dash. "Twaynas Dash 
qualified just so-so and ran a big race that night," said the 33-year-old Utah 
native. "I was glad to win two for Wayne Thompson (Twaynas Dash and Flow 
Control). He's my main stable."

One of the most interesting races will pit local star Baychaino against New 
Mexico invader Ferrari in the Marathon at 870 yards. "Baychaino feels a lot 
better after his last win than he did after finishing second at Pomona," 
trainer Charles Treece said. "He's a good 3-year-old hooking older horses. The 
other horse (Ferrari) has never run on a five-eighths mile track, but they say 
good horses run anywhere."

Sympathy for Wood: Ron Wood, a guitarist with the Rolling Stones, was 
recovering Tuesday after breaking two legs in the aftermath of a highway 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, 43, stepped from his limousine after it crashed Monday near Newbury, in 
southern England. He was going to direct traffic away from the wreckage but an 
oncoming car hit him. Tuesday he joked with friends: "The doctors have 
prescribed as part of my treatment a pint of Guinness a day, so that can't be 
bad." One of the other drivers involved in the accident, however, said Wood had

'BUTTERFLIES': VIEW OF A MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Apocalyptic Butterflies" is a war play. Its battlefield is a small kitchen in 
a small house in Fryeburg, Me. Its combatants are Hank and Muriel, and its 
skirmishes continue the one martial confrontation that will never be fought to 
more than a draw: the War Between Men and Women. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Wendy MacLeod doesn't dig too deeply into character in her 
razor-sharp domestic comedy at the Zephyr Theatre, and needn't to prove her 
points. Her antagonists are not merely icons for an unhappy wife turned harpy 
and an inadequate husband turned Neanderthal bully. They are signposts of 
disaster for any relationships in which self-motivation and self-gratification 
erode the structure of the union itself. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier play than MacLeod's "The House of Yes," currently at Las Palmas 
Theatre, "Butterflies" is painted in broad strokes, and the madness of 
MacLeod's method is reminiscent of that earlier "War Between Men and Women," 
the culmination of James Thurber's lifelong exploration of the battle of the 
sexes. The edge of both humorists' wit is sharpened by an underlying 
bitterness. As Thurber applied his discomfort with relationships to 
illuminating their absurdity, MacLeod uses her discomfort with their modern 
equivalent to define some of the timeless barriers in domestic partnership. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod puts it right on the line, and so does Stephen Caffrey in his 
no-holds-barred direction. He calls a shrew a shrew and a clod a clod, but 
never allows his actors to overindulge. They shriek at each other interminably, 
but within the director and playwright's outlines. They're crying for 
understanding and, like many couples, can't do it at normal volume. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Raci and Elizabeth Hanley are the foes, and handle the couple's anger with 
compassion and a great deal of humor. But they're somewhat overshadowed by 
Megan Mullally's gem of a performance as Trudy, a woman Hank picks up during 
"24 hours on his own." Mullally pinpoints all the facets of Trudy's twisted 
logic, and her line readings glisten with comic brilliance. Peg Shirley 
provides gentle wisdom as Hank's mother, and Jerry Tullos has a nice nuttiness 
as his father, though Tullos, the only cast member using a New England accent, 
lets it slip a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod wants us to laugh at her couple's plight, and we often do. We know that 
as soon as they sit down and start to communicate, half their battle is won, 
even though we go along with Thurber's prophecy that there will never be a full 
armistice.

U.S. SEEKS SOVIET CONTACTS BEYOND TOP KREMLIN CIRCLE; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: WITH THE REPUBLICS BECOMING MORE INDEPENDENT, WASHINGTON LOOKS TO 
THEIR LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a subtle but significant shift of policy, the United States is quietly 
moving to expand its contacts with Soviet leaders and opinion makers beyond the 
immediate circle of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects a feeling by top policy-makers in Washington that with 
individual Soviet republics becoming more and more independent and the central 
government gradually ceding power, Washington must begin dealing with a wider 
circle than it has. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that no longer are all the important people only in the Kremlin," 
a senior Bush Administration official said, explaining the more open U.S. 
approach. "We need to know the range of opinion in the country and its 
potential successor generation." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a wide-ranging intelligence review has begun to examine the 
consequences for the United States of a breakup of the Soviet Union -- and the 
possible unseating of Gorbachev as the country's leader. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are not predicting any full-fledged shift away from Gorbachev 
soon. "We've still got important international business to do with Gorbachev -- 
arms control treaties, trade agreements, Persian Gulf cooperation," one said. 
"It's a fact of life that he is the Soviet head of state." 
</P>
<P>
But they are saying that Washington ought to be better positioned, both to keep 
current with these trends and to deal with emerging Soviet leaders -- if only 
to maintain some influence in whatever events may be unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is in transition, toward what no one knows," a senior State 
Department official said. "We're trying to keep up with the curve." 
</P>
<P>
The new mood is in sharp contrast to that evident only six months ago, when 
Bush Administration officials were concerned that any smiles upon Gorbachev's 
rivals might undermine his authority in Moscow and cripple his ability to keep 
the 15 constituent republics intact. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, when Gorbachev's main rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, came to 
Washington, senior Bush aides openly lamented his decision to visit here. The 
volatile politician was kept waiting at the White House gate and later derided 
by presidential staffers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Yeltsin has become the highly popular president of the 
Russian Federation, and last month White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu 
paid him a courtesy call in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Other Soviet visitors are receiving warmer and more visible treatment in 
Washington as well. Only last week, Anatoly Sobchat, Leningrad's radical mayor, 
met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser 
Brent Scowcroft and later saw Bush himself briefly. And just last month, Baker 
met with Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov, another radical. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the increasing U.S. openness, critics said Administration policy is 
not changing fast enough or deeply enough to reflect the growing 
"Balkanization" of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"They are no longer calling Yeltsin a drunk and womanizer (as some have 
charged)," said Jeremy R. Azrael, a RAND Corp. analyst in Santa Monica, "but we 
still don't have a consulate in Kiev, and no official presence in the Caucasus 
(where ethnic violence and armed clashes have produced near anarchy). 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't know these folks," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
A former CIA analyst, Azrael contended that the Soviet Union is in a "terminal" 
crisis that has "momentous implications" for U.S. interests. But to date, he 
said, Washington has made "almost no effort" to try to influence those 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Simes, a Soviet specialist with the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace, agreed, adding that the new U.S. posture is only a 
reactive adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a new policy if you just receive people at a slightly higher level, 
with slightly greater dignity," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Azrael argued that the current U.S. policy review ought to consider far broader 
issues, among them: How confident can the United States be, with Gorbachev 
losing influence, that the Kremlin will continue to be able to deliver on arms 
control, trade and other commitments? 
</P>
<P>
He said Washington also ought to be pondering how certain it is -- with 
disarray in the Soviet military and KGB secret police -- that the Kremlin will 
be able to maintain exclusive control of Soviet nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Azrael argued that not only should more U.S. diplomats go out in the field, but 
also that the Pentagon ought to be broadening and deepening its contacts with 
the Soviet military. 
</P>
<P>
"We should know the phone numbers of Soviet missile commanders out in Siberia, 
to ask them what they think of things, not just talk to (Soviet Chief of Staff 
Mikhail S.) Moiseyev and the Soviet Ministry of Defense in Moscow," he 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they already are moving in this direction, with plans to set 
up new diplomatic posts in the Soviet hinterland, where future leaders of the 
fast-fragmenting country may be emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the United States has official diplomatic posts only in Moscow and 
Leningrad. It has had longstanding plans, now awaiting congressional approval, 
to set up an office in Kiev, where demonstrators recently forced the 
resignation of the Ukrainian prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department is planning to open a new office in Muslim Central Asia, 
either in Tashkent or Alma Ata; in the Caucasus, probably in Tbilisi, Georgia, 
to cover that republic as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in the Pacific 
Far East, at Vladivostok or Khabarovsk. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow also wants a larger staff to increase visits to 
Siberian cities and hot spots in Soviet Europe, such as Kishinev in Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Soviets have been "receptive" to the idea of expanding U.S. 
representation, a State Department official said, although they would 
undoubtedly want reciprocal consular rights in such cities as Chicago, Atlanta 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that it's critical to their efforts to attract foreign economic 
investment that we have access to republic centers and regions where the 
investment would go," the senior Bush Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the Soviet Embassy here in Washington now has a man who is 'dual-hatted,' 
one dealing with republic affairs, the other with Soviet affairs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The republics, especially Russia, are being assertive in claiming rights that 
were once the unquestioned domain of the Soviet central government and making 
signs that they will want their own bilateral agreements on trade and joint 
ventures with foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, for example, has complained that last year's U.S.-Soviet agreement to 
divide Arctic maritime resources was not a good deal and that he may want to 
renegotiate it. He also has said he wants a role in talks with Japan over the 
disputed Kuril Islands. 
</P>
<P>
This emerging competition between the central and regional authorities has 
created new problems for U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is to deal jointly with both the Soviet government and the 
republican governments, but we say they should settle the question of who is 
pre-eminent," the U.S. official said.

BUSH'S PLAN TO SCARE IRAQ INSTEAD JOLTED SUPPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five days after ordering that more than 200,000 additional troops be sent to 
the Persian Gulf, President Bush has landed squarely in the middle of a 
dilemma: How can he scare Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait without scaring the 
American people out of their support for his policies? 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides leave no doubt that jolting the Iraqi president is a big part of the 
Administration's strategy. "His thought processes -- that's what we're really 
trying to affect here," a senior Administration official said the day after 
Bush announced the new Persian Gulf deployment. "One of the things we want to 
do is to convince him . . . that we are serious." 
</P>
<P>
But the policy also has convinced many members of Congress -- and many of their 
constituents -- that the United States is a lot closer to a bloody war in 
Kuwait than they had thought. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a sudden upsurge of publicly expressed doubts about Bush's 
plans and calls for Congress to return to Washington to debate what, exactly, 
the United States is doing in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the White House tried belatedly to calm those fears, with spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater repeating, over and over, during his daily briefing for 
reporters that "We want a peaceful resolution" and "There is no war . . . we 
want to avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
And Secretary of State James A. Baker III -- who was Bush's chief political 
operative long before he became the nation's top diplomat -- tried his hand at 
convincing Americans that the fate of Kuwait matters to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's jobs," he declared flatly. 
</P>
<P>
The United States cannot allow Hussein "to sit astride the economic lifeline of 
the industrial world (that) runs through the gulf," Baker said in Hamilton, 
Bermuda, where he met with Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark. "To bring it 
down to the level of the average American citizen, let me say that means jobs." 
</P>
<P>
In making that argument, Baker was advancing in public the line that nearly all 
Administration officials offer in private. If Hussein emerges victorious from 
this conflict, they say, he will be able to dominate the gulf, controlling oil 
production from the entire region and exercising enormous power over the world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
But the argument is one that Bush has shied away from making publicly, ever 
since protesters began appearing at his speeches accusing him of plotting a 
"war for oil." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a war for oil," the President has insisted. Instead, he has said, the 
United States is involved in the gulf to prevent "naked aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting split -- an economic argument in private, a lofty "principle" 
argument in public -- has contributed to an air of confusion over the 
Administration's purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In most wars Americans have fought, the government eventually has settled on a 
single, easily explainable rationale to justify fighting, from "making the 
world safe for democracy" in World War I to preventing the expansion of 
communism in Vietnam. The explanations have not always turned out to make sense 
after the fact, but they have served a crucial role in a democracy of helping 
both troops and the folks back home understand why they were being asked to 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the absence of a single explanation has laid bare a fundamental 
problem for the President. 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than three months of speeches, news conferences and statements, he 
and his aides clearly have not yet persuaded Americans to accept his view that 
a war in the gulf may be necessary for U.S. national interests. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that Bush and his aides have offered at least half a 
dozen different explanations for the U.S. policy in the gulf, ranging from 
concerns over the "new world order" to worries about Iraq's future potential as 
a nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
A second factor has been Bush's reluctance to address the economic argument 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts on international oil markets and finance question Administration 
assertions that Hussein could be a major threat to the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration officials insist that if the Iraqi leader emerges 
victorious from this conflict, he will be able to dominate the gulf, 
controlling oil production from the entire region and thereby wielding enormous 
international economic power. 
</P>
<P>
At stake, said Baker, could be "an economic recession worldwide, caused by the 
control by one nation -- one dictator, if you will -- of the West's economic 
lifeline." 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, repeating his key word for a third time, would be "the 
loss of jobs on the part of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has preferred to make the argument that the United States must prove that 
"aggression" cannot prevail. 
</P>
<P>
That argument, however, has a major flaw that even Administration supporters, 
such as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, have pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
On many occasions the United States has allowed aggression to go unchallenged 
and the Administration will almost certainly do so again, Kissinger wrote 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the country would have to turn into a sort of "global 
policeman," a concept that Americans would be unlikely to support. Bush, 
Kissinger said, needs to spell out why this particular aggression is worth 
shedding American blood to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Tuesday why Iraq's aggression is different from the many others that the 
United States over the years has not tried to stop, White House spokesman 
Fitzwater turned to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is support of these U.N. resolutions," Fitzwater said when asked to 
explain why Bush is committed to deterring aggression in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions "have charted the course, they have set the policy," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Given the relatively low esteem in which the United Nations is held by many 
Americans, however, the notion that the Administration is merely following a 
U.N. mandate in the Persian Gulf may not help much in calming concerns about 
the path that the President is following.

GORBACHEV OKS COALITION RULE, YELTSIN ASSERTS

Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian Federation, said 
Tuesday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed in principle to 
the formation of "a coalition government of national unity," including Yeltsin 
nominees, as a way of sharing power and ending the country's political 
paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he told Gorbachev that Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 
15 constituent republics, would want the right to name the prime minister of 
the central government as well as its defense and finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Recounting his five-hour Sunday meeting with Gorbachev, Yeltsin told members of 
the Russian legislature that he had proposed "a complete new system of state 
power -- the formation of a coalition government of national unity" -- and that 
Gorbachev "in principle supported the line." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing military officers on Tuesday, did not respond directly to 
Yeltsin's proposal but said, "There were no differences with the head of the 
Russian Parliament on the need to create a united but renewed union of 
sovereign states. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider that the conversation was responsible, serious and constructive," 
the Soviet president said, letting stand without demur the Russian leader's 
assertion that they had agreed both on a division of power between the central 
government and the republics and the formation of the proposed coalition 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"And after such a fundamental exchange of opinion on this question, I think I 
have the confidence that we here in the center and the leadership of Russia 
will act in a spirit that corresponds to the interests of our national state 
and all its peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly N. Ignatenko, the president's press secretary, said later that some 
descriptions of the Gorbachev-Yeltsin talks were "a bit sensational," but he 
refused the opportunity to deny that the two leaders had, in fact, reached an 
agreement on a sharing of power and establishment of a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was very acute -- polemical, I would say -- but constructive," 
Ignatenko said. "There were no real differences between the president and 
Yeltsin." 
</P>
<P>
The political and personal rivalry between Gorbachev and Yeltsin has sharpened 
the country's political crisis in recent months. Gorbachev found that Yeltsin's 
proposals commanded popular support where his own reforms drew increasing 
criticism. But Yeltsin discovered that he had little hope of implementing any 
of his ideas without Gorbachev's power. 
</P>
<P>
Each, however, has a sharply different vision of the country's future and a 
strategy on how to get there. That difference plus old quarrels have kept them 
apart as the Soviet economy has continued to disintegrate, ethnic unrest has 
grown and social discontent deepened. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Yeltsin, the agreement would appear to doom the moderate 
government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who has strongly resisted the 
radical economic reforms favored by Yeltsin and who had persuaded Gorbachev 
only last month to pursue narrower reforms at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not claim many posts before consulting with you," Yeltsin told the 
Russian deputies, "but I did express the wish for three -- prime minister, 
finance and defense." 
</P>
<P>
But the next step in cementing the new alliance between the country's most 
powerful leaders was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Gorbachev has defended the increasingly unpopular Ryzhkov, leading 
many Soviet political observers to believe that the president needs the backing 
of the country's vast military-industrial complex not only to pursue his 
reforms but even to remain in office himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, moreover, has no established political or constitutional 
mechanism to implement the agreement outlined by Yeltsin. Nominated by the 
president, the country's prime minister must be elected by the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the national Parliament, and his ministers confirmed by the 
Supreme Soviet, the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, as sketched by Yeltsin and partially confirmed by Gorbachev, 
goes far beyond establishing a coalition government, however, and looks toward 
an entirely new political system in which the republics will have far greater 
authority on their own territory as well as a larger voice in the formulation 
of national policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that a draft of the new treaty reconstituting the Soviet Union 
as a much looser federation will be published in about a week and that this 
will form the basis for further discussions on the division of political and 
economic power in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Without an "active, constructive and responsible" role for Russia, now led by 
Yeltsin and other radical reformers, Gorbachev acknowledged that it would be 
impossible to conclude the new union treaty -- and that this could plunge the 
country into chaos and even civil conflict. Russia is home to half the Soviet 
Union's 290 million people and makes up two-thirds of its territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This union of sovereign states is, to use a military term, the last ditch," he 
told the officers. "Beyond that, the collapse of the state begins. Attempts to 
divide peoples who have lived together for centuries could end in a blood bath. 
And it is necessary to recall that the country's economy is based on a unitary 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"If no account is taken of this, the situation will be worse than during the 
Cultural Revolution in China," Gorbachev warned.

'TAMING' OF THE WILD WEST IS REWRITTEN BY SCHOLARS;

Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
When profit-hungry white settlers, heavily subsidized by the federal 
government, invaded the West -- ravaging the environment, depleting natural 
resources, conquering the various other peoples who had arrived there before 
them, and planting the seeds for many of the problems the region faces today. 
</P>
<P>
Turning their backs on the heroic frontier story as told in countless movies, a 
new generation of scholars has rejected the notion that the West was "tamed" 
through an unbroken series of triumphs and acts of individual courage. 
</P>
<P>
Their perspective, being heard in college classrooms around the country, may 
well be "making John Wayne spin around in his coffin," as Dallas Times-Herald 
columnist Molly Ivins approvingly told a recent gathering of historians here. 
It is also breathing new life into a once moribund academic field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced that a key chapter of 
American history had ended three years earlier, because as census figures 
showed, no more unsettled land remained in the Great West -- in other words, 
the frontier days had come to an end. For much of the time since then, Western 
history was taught as a single, triumphant process of settlement that came to a 
halt a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
What was overlooked, most of the so-called new Western historians say, is the 
continuing, and far richer, story of a distinct and increasingly important 
region "washed by successive waves of emigrants who have been moving, settling 
and adapting to the country for at least 25,000 years," as historian Elliot 
West of the University of Arkansas puts it. 
</P>
<P>
The "new" historians, led by media-conscious Patricia Nelson Limerick, 39, of 
the University of Colorado, and shaped by the politics of the Vietnam era, 
focus on what was omitted from the legends. They explore the settlers' failures 
-- economic and moral -- the environmental consequences, the role of the 
federal government, the resilience of native peoples and other ethnic groups 
and the part played by women. 
</P>
<P>
To these scholars, Gen. George A. Custer was more fool than martyr, and the 
missionaries who died at the hands of the Indians -- such as Narcissa and 
Marcus Whitman, who were massacred with 12 others by the Cayuse in 1847 -- 
contributed to their demise by their misguided attempt to do good works. 
</P>
<P>
The revisionist view has been attacked as neither new nor true to history. Most 
of it has been expressed before, but probably not in as coherent and forceful a 
fashion. Despite their reservations, many academics at the Western History 
Assn. meeting last month grudgingly conceded that Limerick, known to her 
colleagues as Patty, and the other mavericks have brought new -- and measurable 
-- respectability and excitement to a discipline once derided on many campuses 
as "cowboys and Indians." 
</P>
<P>
"Patty's done more to publicize what we do and bring it to the attention of the 
American public than anyone who's been writing Western history for the last 50 
years," said Paul Andrew Hutton of the University of New Mexico, who still sees 
value in teaching frontier history. "My graduate students think Patty walks on 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Revisionism has been the subject of cover stories in three national 
publications during the last eight months. (since March 18) 
</P>
<P>
Eagerly, if nervously anticipated, are two books scheduled to be published next 
year by Western historians William Cronon of Yale University and Richard White 
of the University of Washington that are widely expected to set new standards 
in the field. Along with Limerick and Donald Worster of the University of 
Kansas, Cronon and White are part of what some refer to as the Gang of Four. 
</P>
<P>
As further evidence of the hoopla, an estimated 700 people -- 200 more than 
last year -- exchanged shoptalk and ideas against an unlikely backdrop of slot 
machines and blackjack tables at a casino hotel near Reno. Western history 
buffs in bolo ties, many of them members of an international organization known 
as the Westerners, used to predominate at the annual Western history meeting, 
which welcomes amateurs as well as academics. This year, perhaps as a 
reflection of the growing prestige of the field, non-academics were a distinct 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
Many participants were drawn by a non-traditional program organized by Limerick 
around such topics as the black population of Orange County, being Indian in 
the 20th Century, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the 
novelist's "advantage" in understanding the West, and a much-debated proposal 
to turn the Great Plains into a national park. 
</P>
<P>
What some historians describe as a revolution in their field was sparked three 
years ago by the publication of Limerick's "The Legacy of Conquest," a 
synthesis, as she is the first to admit, of other scholars' research, seen from 
a revisionist perspective. Limerick is a Banning native whose long straight 
hair, barrettes and fondness for paisley are a throwback to her undergraduate 
days at UC Santa Cruz. She forthrightly sought not only to bury Turner's 
frontier thesis once and for all but also to emphasize what she sees as a 
continuity in the region's history. 
</P>
<P>
Turner -- who in 1895 at the University of Wisconsin became the first professor 
ever to teach Western history -- wrote in 1893 that population figures derived 
from the latest census proved that the frontier, the "meeting point between 
savagery and civilization," was closed because no large tracts of land remained 
unsettled. It was the advance westward, Turner said, that had turned Europeans 
into Americans and imbued this country with its individualistic, democratic and 
optimistic spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"This tale has unquestionable power and influence but bears little resemblance 
to the events of the Western past," Limerick countered nearly 100 years later. 
"The myth has the undeniable charm of simplicity. Simplicity, alas, is the one 
quality that cannot be found in the actual story of the American West." 
</P>
<P>
Turner-bashing is hardly a new exercise. His theories were repudiated as early 
as the 1930s, as the country entered a more pessimistic and cynical period. 
However, they enjoyed a period of revival a generation later, when such 
historians as Ray Allen Billington of Northwestern University began searching 
for a definition of the American character. "Idealism drove the pioneers onward 
no less than the hope of material gain," Billington wrote in 1963. "They were 
dreamers who found in westering a road to the foot of the rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Today, no historian accepts Turner uncritically. Some say that Limerick is 
attacking a straw man when her real quarrel is more with the mythology of the 
West than with the way the subject is taught. Limerick argues that most 
American historians mistakenly view the West through the overly nationalistic 
and celebratory frontier prism, without adequate attention to how diverse 
peoples converged in the region -- women, as well as men, Indians, Europeans, 
Latin Americans, Asians and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Legacy" does not even mention the Lewis and Clark expedition, Custer's battle 
at the Little Big Horn or the Gunfight at O.K. Corral. It is a plea to see the 
West in complex, unsentimental terms: To remember that many settlers simply 
could not make it and returned home; that horrible accidents occurred in the 
mines while the legal system offered the miners no protection; that federal 
policies helped create a pattern of boom-bust cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Where Indians once were treated as barriers to the settlers' progress, new 
historians urge a closer look at how European intruders must have appeared to 
the Indians. Borrowing from environmental historians, they find links between 
massive cattle deaths in the 1880s caused by overgrazing and current 
allegations that the federal government is similarly ruining the range by 
keeping grazing fees artificially low. 
</P>
<P>
Limerick said about 200 Western historians, including many who would prefer to 
be grouped under the heading of Chicano, Asian or Native American studies and 
some who are still in graduate school, are sympathetic to the revisionist 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are historians who say it is wrong, even dangerous, to view 
the past by the standards of today. Nineteenth-Century settlers cleared oak 
forests to make way for farmland, with lasting repercussions for the 
environment. To hold "farmers who have no familiarity and experience in this . 
. . accountable in some way isn't right," said Martin Ridge, professor emeritus 
at the University of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an environmentalist in the 20th-Century sense but I cannot turn the clock 
back," said Ridge, who has been attacked by Limerick as a symbol of Turnerism. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the political slant of the new history can also lead to 
oversimplification and overemphasis on the darker aspects. "I think I come down 
somewhere in the middle," said Glenda Riley, a women's historian at Marquette 
University in Milwaukee. "Like with women -- there was a lot of wife abuse, 
there was rape, the divorce rate was pretty high. . . . But on the other hand, 
there were a lot of jobs available . . . and (women's) suffrage was here (in 
the West) first." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Limerick's self-characterization as pioneer has caused a good 
measure of resentment. "Sometimes, (revisionists) don't acknowledge some of the 
ancestors of the newer spirit, and it hurts our feelings a little bit," said 
Wilbur Jacobs, professor emeritus at UC Santa Barbara, who is considered a 
forerunner in the field of environmental history. 
</P>
<P>
To the charge that her work is not new -- that it reflects much of the social 
history that has been popular in American history for the past three decades -- 
Limerick responds: "There have always been those pieces and parts. But putting 
it into one new vision and calling that 'conquest' -- that is new." 
</P>
<P>
"What Patty wants to do is be the Frederick Jackson Turner of her time," said 
Hutton of the University of New Mexico -- an assessment that Limerick dismisses 
as "perfect idiocy," saying, "I want there to be a lot of Turners." 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, they might well include the following scholars -- all but one 
did graduate work at Yale -- whose names crop up in nearly every discussion of 
new historians: 
</P>
<P>
* Richard White: A year from now, "Legacy" is likely to be supplanted by 
White's thick textbook called "It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own," in an 
ironic reference to a cowboy song. Six years in the making, it will offer the 
first chronological narrative from the revisionist perspective. 
</P>
<P>
White, 43, a soft-spoken man whose gray hair reaches to his shoulders, is 
interested in how the heroic legends developed and were incorporated into 
people's behavior. He said he will also demonstrate how "the West instead of 
being a region that's the most individualistic is the region that is most 
dependent on the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
* Donald Worster: Born in Needles, Calif., the Jeremiah of the foursome offers 
an uncompromisingly anti-capitalist view of a region he defines by its dryness. 
His latest book, "Rivers of Empire," traces the effects of massive irrigation 
systems in creating a "hydraulic society" that is "increasingly a coercive, 
monolithic . . . system, ruled by a power elite based on the ownership of 
capital and expertise." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the South, said Worster, 49, the West has never been subjected 
to an internal moral critique. "The old Western myth was that these people were 
the salt of the Earth, that they were people of astounding virtue," he said. 
"But these same people often were filled with greed and violence and corruption 
and racism. . . . No people went through an environment faster, and more 
destructively and more wastefully than Americans have gone through North 
America." 
</P>
<P>
* William Cronon: A protege of Howard R. Lamar at Yale, also Limerick's mentor, 
Cronon has a close relationship with other new historians but has distanced 
himself from some of their arguments. Although very much of an environmental 
historian, he is more moderate than the others and more inclined to see the 
development of the West as "an ambiguous legacy." 
</P>
<P>
Cronon, 36, a Rhodes scholar and MacArthur fellow, considers himself a frontier 
historian rather than a regionalist, having chosen the field because it 
encompassed his -- and Turner's -- home state of Wisconsin. "Because Wisconsin 
is east of the Mississippi, I'm nervous about any definition that excludes it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His new book, "Nature's Metropolis," will show how environmental changes in the 
West, such as the destruction of millions of bison, were linked to the rise of 
Chicago in the latter part of the 19th Century. This "urban-rural linkage" has 
previously been overlooked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether new or not, many of the revisionist concepts have already seeped into 
the mainstream. Despite a predilection for guns and Western movies, the 
2-year-old Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles attempts to strip 
the frontier story of some of its romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
Given additional resources, chief curator James H. Nottage said, "I would be 
doing more and more to make clear what the different ethnic and cultural voices 
were in the whole settlement and development of what we call the West."

LUNGREN, SMITH VIRTUALLY TIED IN ATTY. GEN. VOTING; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE REPUBLICAN PULLS TO WITHIN 1,077 VOTES OF THE DEMOCRAT AS THE 
TABULATION OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS CONTINUES.

<P>
Republican Dan Lungren on Tuesday pulled into a virtual tie with Democratic foe 
Arlo Smith in the bitterly contested race for state attorney general, as 
election officials across the state tallied the bulk of absentee ballots 
counted since last week's state election. 
</P>
<P>
Figures released late Tuesday afternoon by the secretary of state's office 
showed Smith ahead by 1,077 votes statewide -- out of more than 7 million votes 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had led Lungren by 28,836 votes on election night. But Lungren has slowly 
but steadily chipped away at Smith's lead as absentee ballots, which 
traditionally favor Republicans, have been counted across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's major surge came at 4:30 p.m. when the San Diego County registrar of 
voters office released figures showing that the former five-term congressman 
had picked up 16,567 votes in the southern county on San Francisco Dist. Atty. 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren is expected to gain additional ground in Los Angeles County -- where he 
already picked up 5,904 votes in the first batch of 77,000 absentee ballots -- 
when another 50,000 absentees are counted later this week. Lungren anticipates 
more gains in absentee votes in suburban counties such as Ventura and Orange 
where more than 65,000 ballots are still out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Smith camp moved forward with court efforts to try to blunt the 
Lungren surge. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Dann, Smith's campaign manager, said attorneys were preparing to file a 
court suit against Secretary of State March Fong Eu, demanding that absentee 
votes be invalidated in counties where the registrars' offices did not compare 
the signatures on absentee ballot applications with those on voters' affidavits 
of registration. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, said Dann, the suit could void the tabulation of absentee 
ballots in counties, including San Diego and Los Angeles, where Lungren has 
made significant gains. 
</P>
<P>
Dann said the new suit is being filed in Orange County, where the Smith forces 
won a temporary halt to the absentee count last Saturday after raising the 
possibility of absentee-vote fraud. In an unusual weekend hearing, Orange 
County Superior Court Judge James Smith ordered Orange County Registrar of 
Voters Donald Tanney to temporarily cease counting absentees unless Tanney 
altered his tabulating methods. 
</P>
<P>
Citing scattered reports statewide, the Smith camp has charged that Republican 
Party workers may have improperly submitted absentee ballot applications on 
behalf of an undetermined number of voters by forging signatures. While the 
voters may have otherwise properly cast absentee ballots, Smith is contending 
that their votes should not count if they received their ballots in a 
technically improper manner. 
</P>
<P>
GOP officials have denied improperly submitting absentee applications on behalf 
of voters. Tanney has refused to change the method of his count, saying it 
would be wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the initial lawsuit, which had been scheduled for today in Santa 
Ana, was pushed back to Friday after attorneys for Orange County requested more 
time to back up their position. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's major boost in San Diego was not altogether unexpected since, on 
Election Day, the Long Beach native had walloped his Northern California 
opponent there by a count of 299,579 votes to Smith's 221,707.

CASE TESTS LAW ON STUDY OF INDIAN GRAVES;

ARCHEOLOGY: TWO SCIENTISTS ARE ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY EXCAVATING HUMAN BONES. 
COLLEAGUES RALLY TO THEIR SIDE.

<P>
Known largely as the home of the National Date Festival, this small desert town 
became the battleground Tuesday in an unprecedented court case against two 
archeologists accused of illegally excavating a pound of human bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists from around the state, some passing out bumper stickers saying 
"Archeology Is Not a Crime," gathered at Indio Municipal Court in support of 
colleagues David Van Horn and Robert Scott White and their embattled field of 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an attack worldwide, whether it's Khomeini in Iran or fundamentalists in 
Georgia, this is against science," said Roy Salls, assistant director of the 
Center for Public Archeology at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Van Horn and his associate White, both of Riverside County, 
marks the first use of a 2-year-old state law making Indian grave desecration a 
felony. It also embodies a national debate over the treatment of American 
Indian bones as objects of research rather than sacred remains entitled to 
reburial. 
</P>
<P>
Van Horn claims that he and White have become scapegoats because of his 
outspoken views on the subject. A sharp-tongued critic of efforts to return 
artifacts and bones to their Indian descendants, Van Horn lost a 1986 civil 
suit filed by the state attorney general after he refused to surrender two 
milling stones found with a pair of prehistoric skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the criminal charges, he and White could face three years in 
state prison. But Richard Erwood, a Riverside County deputy prosecutor, said 
Tuesday that he would seek only probation for the two scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Van Horn's claims, the soft-spoken Erwood has maintained that he is 
only trying to enforce the law, not make history. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, meanwhile, said they hope to convince Municipal Judge B. J. 
Bjork that the charges should be dismissed by the end of this week's 
preliminary hearing and not carried over to Superior Court for trial. 
</P>
<P>
"God help us if these two are found to be crooks," said Donald W. Jordan Jr., 
White's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from a small dig in the nearby desert resort of Indian Wells 
where in May, 1989, White unearthed charcoal, pottery shards and about a pound 
of bone chips, none larger than a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Van Horn's firm, Archeological Associates, had been hired to survey the site 
for any significant artifacts before it was developed into a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
A key point in the case is whether the bone chips should have been identified 
as human remains in the field or whether, as the defendants contend, they 
needed to be examined by an expert in a lab. 
</P>
<P>
White brought all the material back to Van Horn's Sun City office, and Van Horn 
sent the bone fragments to a specialist at UCLA, where they were identified as 
human. Erwood says the pair should have realized they had found a cremation 
site and contacted the county coroner, the first step under laws protecting 
Indian graves. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the testimony Tuesday dispelled any romance about archeology, 
describing instead how material from the dig was painstakingly placed in small 
plastic bags and labeled, and how White and a volunteer assistant sifted 
through sand and artifacts, laboring in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jordan later turned up the heat in the courtroom with a brutal 
cross-examination of a San Diego archeologist who testified that he was able to 
tell the bone fragments were human by their shape and burn marks. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jordan's questioning, witness Brian Smith acknowledged that he had 
little, if any, direct field experience, especially with cremation sites. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan and defense attorney Gary Scherotter also succeeded in showing that 
Smith and another witness for the prosecution, UC Riverside archeologist Bruce 
Love, compete with Van Horn for consulting contracts. Love testified that Van 
Horn had been told about two earlier discoveries of cremation sites within a 
mile of his dig -- evidence that Van Horn might have expected to find human 
remains. But the defense claimed he never received supporting documentation, 
even though he asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing could conclude this afternoon.

MIXED EMOTIONS GRIP SAILORS, FAMILY AND FRIENDS AS WWII BATTLESHIP MISSOURI 
DEPARTS FOR MIDEAST

The battleship Missouri cruised out of the Long Beach Naval Station on Tuesday 
en route to the Persian Gulf and the massive U.S. military buildup for 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth, recommissioned World War II warship -- a virtual fortress equipped 
with Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking targets 600 miles away, famed 
16-inch artillery guns and other weaponry -- left in a tearful send-off from 
families and friends of the Missouri's 1,500-member crew. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what role the so-called "Mighty Mo" would play in combat is unclear, 
but its offensive capabilities include long-range Tomahawk strikes, Harpoon 
missile attacks against enemy ships and the bombardment of coastal positions in 
support of amphibious assaults by Marines. The Missouri's nine 16-inch guns can 
send shells the weight of a Volkswagen a distance of 23 miles, and its 12 
five-inch guns can send 55-pound shells up to nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
Officers and sailors expressed both excitement and nervousness, eagerness and 
regret, about the prospect of combat. "You really don't know how it's going to 
play out, so the apprehension is there," said Lt. Cmdr. T. McCreary, the ship's 
public affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little scarier this time," said Tim Garcia, a boiler technician, 
comparing his present duty to that of 1987, when he served aboard a ship that 
escorted U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the height of the Iraq-Iran war. 
</P>
<P>
If war breaks out, it would be the Missouri's first combat since its shore 
bombardment of North Korean positions from 1950 to 1953. The ship, commissioned 
in 1944, participated in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa before the 
Japanese signed terms of surrender on its deck on Sept. 2, 1945, ending World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Decommissioned in 1955, the Missouri was retrofitted and recommissioned in 
1986. Reforms in Eastern Europe prompted a movement to put the Missouri in 
mothballs, but the upheaval in the Persian Gulf has changed that agenda, at 
least for now. The guided missile frigate Ford and fast combat supply ship 
Sacramento are escorting the Missouri to the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours before the ship's 2 p.m. departure, families joined the sailors and 
Marines aboard ship for adieus. Sailors and their girlfriends locked lips in 
what seemed a kind of marathon competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ens. Steve Woodcock was seen off by his parents, John and Barbara, who had 
traveled out from Devon, Pa., for the occasion. The 26-year-old had embarked on 
a career as an investment counselor when he abruptly decided to join the Navy. 
"I wanted more excitement in life," Woodcock said. "I think I'm going to get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sailors sought to allay the fears of loved ones by discussing the Missouri's 
thick steel hull and sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-missile guns. "It's 
like a big bulldog. Who's going to mess with a bulldog?" said Warrick Woodard, 
a 50-year-old boatswain mate. 
</P>
<P>
Several sailors spoke hawkishly of the prospect of battle. One 
ex-Marine-turned-sailor who served in Lebanon in 1983, when a truck bomb 
delivered by a kamikaze terrorist killed 241 Marines, spoke of vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"I want revenge," said gunner mate John Scott, 26, who is expected to fly out 
to join his shipmates after a broken ankle heals. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that U.S. officials blamed the 1983 bombing on terrorists backed by 
Iran, not Iraq, Scott shrugged his shoulders. Whoever was at fault, Scott said, 
Iraq is due the pay-back.

EX-THATCHER ALLY TO BID FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY IS EXPECTED TO POSE THE MOST SERIOUS 
CHALLENGE SINCE SHE TOOK REINS IN 1975. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine will run against British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in 
what is expected to be the most serious challenge to Thatcher since she took 
over the party in 1975, close colleagues reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, a member of Parliament and a firm Europeanist, is expected to 
announce his candidacy today, according to widespread reports in London 
political circles. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's popularity has been at a near-low recently because of aspects of her 
domestic and European policies as well as her authoritarian rule in a nation 
used to a more collegial government. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine's candidacy is expected to be bitterly opposed by the prime minister 
and leading members of her Cabinet, because of the dangers such a hard-fought 
contest will pose to the party in the next national election. 
</P>
<P>
But his position was thought to have been bolstered Tuesday by Geoffrey Howe, 
former deputy prime minister, who before a packed House of Commons explained 
his reasons for his surprise resignation 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
In what observers called a scathing and devastating indictment, the normally 
placid Howe said the prime minister was "risking the future" of the country by 
her negative attitude toward the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, the last minister left from Thatcher's original Cabinet, explained that 
his position in calling for Britain to play a leading role in the community was 
constantly undermined by the prime minister's anti-European remarks. 
</P>
<P>
He contrasted the positive, pro-European approach of former Tory Prime 
Ministers Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan against what he called the 
negative "background noise" and "nightmare image" coming from Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said her view of Europe was that it was "positively teeming with 
ill-intended people scheming to extinguish democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of vision is that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Howe's remarks were the more effective for the understated, almost diffident 
way he stated his case, referring to her as "my right honorable friend." 
</P>
<P>
Some embittered pro-Thatcher Tories called Howe's unexpectedly damning speech 
an "incitement to mutiny" and an "act of treachery." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Thatcher had appeared highly confident of any possible party 
contest and used phrases from cricket that vowed to knock any challenger out of 
the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to that analogy, Howe on Tuesday declared that the Conservatives were 
like a team that found their "bats broken by the team captain before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Under Tory party rules, Conservative members of the Commons will vote probably 
within a week on a leader in a secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If Heseltine wins a majority -- 159 votes -- he would become party leader, and 
Thatcher would be forced to step down as prime minister, though there is no set 
time limit to remain in the post. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Conservative Party began at the Rome summit of the European 
Community late last month when Thatcher was outvoted 11 to 1 on setting a 
timetable for the second phase of European monetary union in agreeing to 
establish a central bank by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
She described the Rome proceedings as "cloud-cuckooland," and when she spoke in 
the House of Commons the following Tuesday, the prime minister was equally 
blunt in her assessment of her EC colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
That was too much for Howe, who as foreign secretary had worked strenuously to 
make Britain a cooperating member of the EC -- before Thatcher summarily fired 
him from the job last year. 
</P>
<P>
He turned in his surprise resignation on Nov. 2, which generated speculation 
about a challenge to the Thatcher leadership. That turned the focus to 
Heseltine, 57, who had stalked out of the Cabinet in January, 1986, in a 
complex dispute over the sale of a British helicopter company. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine's lieutenants in the House of Commons say they have at least 100 sure 
votes for him, which would not win the leadership -- but would not be a 
humiliating defeat.

Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called on President Bush to convene a 
special session of Congress to seek a "put-up-or-shut-up" vote on possible 
military action against Iraq. He was joined by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), 
who said Bush has set America on a "collision course" that will end either with 
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait or with warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The White House rejected the request for a special session, noting that "there 
is no war" and therefore no need for a congressional vote. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and 21 other House Democrats 
said they will file a lawsuit in federal court next week in an effort to keep 
the President from launching a military offensive without congressional 
approval.

<P>
U.S. Marines will storm Saudi Arabian beaches less than 30 miles south of the 
Kuwaiti border in a mock amphibious landing scheduled for this weekend, 
Pentagon officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which will simulate a tactic likely to be used in any actual U.S. 
military offensive, will be the first conducted in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Pentagon officials said it is intended to intensify 
pressure on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the exercise represents one of the most provocative gestures 
that the U.S. military has taken toward Iraqi troops dug into largely defensive 
positions just inside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that the exercise is expected to involve as many as 30 
U.S. warplanes and 2,500 Marines who have been afloat on 13 amphibious ships in 
the Persian Gulf for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's acknowledgment of the pending military maneuver came as Bush 
Administration officials tried to quell growing concern on Capitol Hill that 
the United States is pressing to initiate hostilities soon against Iraq. The 
plan sparked significant controversy among lawmakers briefed Tuesday by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, in remarks that were seen as confirming the apparent rush 
toward war, has warned that Congress must give the President latitude to 
respond to sudden threats by Iraq. "There are always those unforeseen kinds of 
provocations that might result in having to move first," White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, in confirming reports of the planned 
amphibious landing exercise, denied that the Marine maneuvers are designed to 
provoke a reaction from Iraqi troops that could be used to justify a U.S. 
military response. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how in the world you could describe these as provocative," 
Williams said. Calling the situation in the Persian Gulf "very fluid," he 
added: "We have to be able to exercise our forces throughout the region. 
Exercising them in sovereign Saudi territory to make them familiar with the 
entire area in which they could potentially be involved is a sensible thing to 
do with the units." 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Pentagon, however, acknowledged that this weekend's activity, 
which follows two previous exercises staged on the beaches of Oman, is designed 
to underscore U.S. military readiness for operations against Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close enough to get their attention, that's for sure," said one military 
officer familiar with the plans. "What are they going to think as they watch 
this on their scopes? It is definitely meant as a show of resolve, but not to 
create a response." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French radio station, Powell said that he does not 
believe that war in the Persian Gulf is imminent, despite the recent 
announcement that another 200,000 American troops will be dispatched there. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this show of resolve will convince Mr. Saddam Hussein that he should 
withdraw his forces," Powell said. "But at the moment, I don't think anyone 
should see that as indicating that a conflict is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing a site about 30 miles south of Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, 
commanders in the region rejected proposals to conduct the exercise even closer 
to Iraqi troop encampments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to mount a demonstration of resolve," a senior Pentagon 
official said. "But it's another thing to expose yourself unnecessarily to 
someone with a hair trigger." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's mock landing will include aerial support from Marine transport 
helicopters, attack choppers and Harrier fighter-bombers. Williams said that 
such exercises are the only way to maintain and sharpen the skills of Marines 
deployed in ships awaiting further orders offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also announced Tuesday that it has authorized the call-up of 
additional Navy reservists and will take similar steps for other services in 
the wake of the President's decision to send more troops to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood acted last Friday 
to raise the ceiling on calling up Navy reservists from 6,300 to 10,000. The 
Navy, which has called 4,616 reservists to active duty, had requested the 
additional authority and said that some of those to be called up will be 
members of construction battalions, called Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that the total number of reserve and National Guard troops called 
up now stands at 36,073. But he added that the planned expansion of the U.S. 
force in the gulf will require the Pentagon's civilian leaders to extend the 
other military services' reserve call-up authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has called 24,524 out of a ceiling of 25,000. The Air Force has called 
5,278 with a ceiling of 14,500, although a large number of Air Force reservists 
have volunteered for active duty. The Marine Corps has called 1,144 of 3,000 
and the Coast Guard 511 out of 1,250.

IRAQI VISITS MOROCCO ON SUMMIT ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
A senior Iraqi envoy arrived in Rabat on Tuesday after Baghdad hinted that it 
might accept Morocco's appeal for a "last chance" Arab summit to avoid war in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan had said on leaving Baghdad 
that Iraq supports "any serious Arab action at any level that would serve the 
Arab nation." 
</P>
<P>
Ramadan will deliver a message from President Saddam Hussein to King Hassan II 
of Morocco. Diplomats said they expect that it will set his conditions for 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, a senior government official said that Egypt is still studying 
Morocco's summit invitation. President Hosni Mubarak made a surprise trip to 
Libya on Tuesday and met leader Moammar Kadafi for talks on the gulf situation. 
No details were released. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev dispatched two senior 
diplomats to sound out Arab leaders on the chances of holding an Arab summit. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets retain close ties in the Arab world because of their past arming of 
Iraq in its war against Iran, their longtime backing of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and their ties with Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand expressed hope that an Arab summit would 
lead to peace. "It's absolutely necessary that Iraq budge from its position of 
refusing everything," he told a news conference in Paris. 
</P>

Ramadan, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said Hussein would attend the summit 
if Iraq's views on the site and issues to be discussed are taken into 
consideration. Baghdad had earlier appeared to reject the summit call.

The mayors of 35 major cities wound up a three-day urban summit Tuesday, 
declaring the "fate of the nation is joined to the fate of its cities." 
</P>
<P>
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins, who read a three-page statement on behalf of 
the mayors, called for a new era of cooperation between businesses and city 
governments to ensure the survival of the nation's urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
With some 20 mayors standing on the podium behind him, Dinkins said their 
objective is to "reclaim the place of our cities as the center of our 
civilization (and to) forge new partnerships with business and labor, with our 
suburban neighbors and with government at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
"Through the taxes our citizens pay, the ideas we offer and the problems we 
solve, America's cities provide our nation's vision and its opportunity," the 
mayor told the news conference at the Sheraton Centre Hotel in mid-town 
Manhattan, where the meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
"We seek a fairer balance of resources and responsibilities," he said. The 
federal government has "burdened" cities with legislation that requires heavy 
municipal spending. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said cities have "absorbed the migration caused by the farm crisis and 
restructured the economy to cope with the decline of our manufacturing 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
A joint statement put out by the mayors said they will "convene a national 
summit meeting with business leaders in 1990 to identify key areas for 
cooperation" between the public and private sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Other mayors joined in Dinkins' call for a new emphasis on promoting economic 
growth in the nation's urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We must focus on the strength of industrial cities and highlight how important 
they are to America's economy," said Raymond Flynn, mayor of Boston. He called 
for "competitive self-help proposals," including "tax laws for creating jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said the cities offer the nation "entertainment, 
culture, jobs. Over time the role of the city has been forgotten. If we don't 
save our cities, we shall not save our nation." 
</P>
<P>
John Norquist, Milwaukee's mayor, said: "Cities in other countries in the world 
are more valued." 
</P>
<P>
He said the cities should be given greater consideration in this country 
because "they are the marketplace, the culture place, not suburban cultures 
like McDonald's and other fast-food sellers." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelmy, said, "There's enough money to fight drugs 
in the city, but we're sending the money to state capitals."

STUDY DISCOVERS NITRATE IN HALF OF NATION'S WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PESTICIDES ALSO FOUND IN SOME. U.S. SAYS THE CONTAMINATION LEVELS ARE 
LOW AND WATER IS SAFE TO DRINK.

<P>
A five-year federal study of the nation's drinking water wells indicates that 
more than half are tainted with nitrates and a small number contain traces of 
pesticides, but officials said Tuesday that there is no "current cause for 
concern" about public health. 
</P>
<P>
The $12-million survey by the Environmental Protection Agency, based on samples 
from more than 1,300 community water systems and rural domestic wells, is part 
of a long-term effort to assess the safety of the country's ground-water 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the widespread presence of nitrates is not surprising. Nitrates 
occur naturally and are released from both human and agricultural wastes as 
well as from the nitrogen that is a key component of commercial fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey -- an attempt to produce a "snapshot" of the more than 10 million 
wells serving rural households and 94,000 wells supplying community water 
systems -- was designed to detect not only nitrates but 126 pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy EPA Administrator Henry Habicht acknowledged that there probably are 
"hot spots" in prime agricultural areas such as California's San Joaquin Valley 
where massive use of pesticides would result in higher pesticide levels in well 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, officials said that most of the nation's well water is safe to 
consume. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings of the survey indicate that the vast majority of drinking water 
wells in this country do not have levels of pesticides or nitrates that would 
pose a risk to public health," Habicht said. "Where pesticides were detected, 
they were usually found at low levels -- below levels of health concern. At the 
same time, the findings underscore the need to be ever vigilant in order to 
avoid more serious problems in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the national sample, the agency estimated that 57% of rural domestic 
wells contain nitrate, while 4.2% contain one or more pesticides and 3.2% 
contain both nitrates and pesticides. It said 52% of community water systems 
contain nitrates, with 10% showing one or more pesticides and 7% containing 
both nitrates and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
It said that 0.6% of rural domestic wells and 0.8% of community wells contain 
pesticides in concentrations above maximum recommended levels. 
</P>
<P>
Although EPA officials noted that adults can tolerate large exposure to 
nitrates, nitrate contamination is known to cause "blue baby syndrome" by 
reducing the ability of an infant's blood to transport oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Potent pesticides have been linked to a variety of cancers and other disorders, 
and several included in the EPA survey are no longer on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several environmental organizations expressed concern over 
the survey's indications of nitrate contamination and criticized it because it 
sampled wells at random rather than in areas where pesticide use is heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"By deciding to look for contamination where pesticides were seldom or never 
used, the EPA seriously hobbled the survey," said Janet S. Hathaway, a senior 
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Of course, you won't find 
contamination where nobody used pesticides. But both common sense and other 
studies show that pesticides are contaminating wells where they are heavily 
used." 
</P>
<P>
Because the survey was the first national attempt to assess the contamination 
of drinking water wells, the EPA had no basis for determining whether the 
situation is improving or growing worse. But officials said that the data will 
provide a benchmark for future assessments. 
</P>
<P>
A second report, to be issued next year, will address the causes of and factors 
associated with well contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticides detected most often in the samples were associated with a 
herbicide marketed under the trade names of Dacthal and Fatal, used on lawns 
and golf courses as well as a variety of fruit and vegetable crops. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the survey, six rural wells were found to have pesticide 
levels above the limits set by EPA, and 32 rural wells and community wells were 
found to have unacceptable nitrate levels. 
</P>
<P>
EPA refused to identify the wells' owners, but officials said that they were 
informed of the finding within two or three days.

LAWYERS' FEES, TAPES PROBE COULD DELAY NORIEGA TRIAL;

NARCOTICS: OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS REMAIN FROZEN. JUDGE QUESTIONS HOW CNN OBTAINED 
PHONE CALL RECORDINGS.

The government's problem-plagued case against deposed dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega appeared Tuesday to be headed for a lengthy delay because of a shortage 
of funds to pay his defense attorneys and a judge's determination to find out 
who leaked taped conversations of the former Panamanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
At a court hearing, Justice Department officials told U.S. District Judge 
William M. Hoeveler that they have been unable to carry out the order he issued 
last June to unfreeze Noriega's overseas bank accounts to provide $4 million to 
$6 million for his legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler replied that he might have to choose court-appointed defense attorneys 
willing to work at much lower government wages, a development that he said 
would postpone the scheduled Jan. 28 start of Noriega's drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the judge said that he might name a special prosecutor to 
investigate how Cable News Network last week obtained government tapes of 
Noriega's jailhouse phone calls to his lawyers and former associates. 
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a plea from Sam Burstyn, an attorney for co-defendant 
Luis A. del Cid, that the judge name a special prosecutor with subpoena power 
to determine why prison officials recorded attorney-client phone calls of 
Noriega and perhaps other defendants. He said that the inquiry should determine 
who had access to the recordings and who gave them to CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler ordered the network last week to stop broadcasting the recordings, but 
CNN initially refused to comply. After the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals 
upheld Hoeveler's injunction, CNN said that it would appeal the matter to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the network agreed to stop the broadcasts when Hoeveler said 
he would postpone any sanctions against CNN until the Supreme Court issues a 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler promised to consider Burstyn's suggestion but said that he first 
wanted to give the FBI a chance to pursue an inquiry it launched last week into 
the tapes. If the FBI needs subpoena power, "they know where to come to get it, 
and I'll be happy to comply," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Noriega's legal fees, a top Justice Department official said 
that government lawyers have tried repeatedly to get Switzerland, France and 
Austria to reverse "freeze orders" imposed on Noriega's bank accounts at the 
department's request last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Drew C. Arena, director of the Justice Department's Office of International 
Affairs, said the department had sought the orders on grounds that more than 
$20 million held overseas by the Panamanian leader represented the illicit 
proceeds of narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hoeveler's insistence, the department started to reverse the process. 
"But it's a little like trying to unring a bell," Arena told the court. 
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign officials have maintained the freeze on grounds their own 
domestic laws provide for forfeiture of any drug money, unless U.S. officials 
certify that Noriega's funds are free of any such taint. "We, of course, cannot 
do that," Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief defense lawyer, said he suspects but cannot 
prove that U.S. officials secretly had encouraged foreign nations to impose 
their own freeze to foul up the defense effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said that he would act by Friday to appoint government-paid defense 
lawyers if the problem remains unresolved. Rubino said he could not afford to 
work for government legal fees of approximately $60 an hour. His own rates are 
$350 an hour, he said.

BRITISH PROTESTERS REPORTED INSIDE NUCLEAR TEST SITE

Three London women who are members of Greenpeace have infiltrated the Nevada 
Test Site in an effort to reach ground zero and stop today's test of a British 
nuclear weapon, a spokeswoman for the environmental group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The women are safe and are still moving toward their objective," said Junior 
Bridge, of Greenpeace in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . They are close enough that their lives would be in danger if the test 
is set off." 
</P>
<P>
But Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said security officials at the 
sprawling desert site were unaware of any infiltration. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department announced Monday it would conduct a test for Great 
Britain at 9 a.m. today at Pahute Mesa, 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The 
device is buried 1,900 feet underground and is expected to produce an explosive 
force of 20 to 150 kilotons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Underground tests of that size can cause 40 Gs of pressure at ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge identified the women as Juley Howard, 23, Jane Gregory, 27, and Lorna 
Richardson, 25.

$3.5-MILLION ARTS FEST URGED FOR '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN FREUDENHEIM, SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego should spend $3.5 million to stage an arts festival in 1992, the city 
manager recommended Tuesday. The report, to be presented to the City Council 
Monday, proposes a festival based on one of two themes -- "New Worlds -- A 
Changing Mosaic" or "European Mosaic '92." 
</P>
<P>
Although private donations will be solicited to help fund the festival, 
according to officials in the city manager's office, the report recommends that 
the city allocate $3 million in transient occupancy tax revenue for the 
festival, including $500,000 from 1991 TOT funds and $1.25 million from 1992 
and 1993. An additional $500,000 budgeted for the festival is expected to come 
from interest earnings, ticket and merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
All of this comes at a time of tight budgets and close scrutiny of monies 
spent. But Bruce Herring, executive director of last fall's "Treasures of the 
Soviet Union" festival and now an official in the city manager's office, is 
optimistic: "I think it's realistic in the sense that we have a proven track 
record." 
</P>
<P>
The city paid $2,970,000 for its first festival, and $2.8 million in net 
proceeds were returned to the city's general fund earlier this year. The report 
also says that the "festival generated an economic impact in San Diego of $46.7 
million," although it does not detail the benefits to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Herring said he believes the new recommendation is "conservative" in light of 
last year's success. "I don't think there's a risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The broad-based European themes for the festival were suggested by a committee 
organized by the Commission for Arts and Culture after a series of public 
meetings last summer, said Darlene Shiley, who chaired the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Both themes are intended to reflect recent political changes in the European 
countries, including the 1992 unification of the European Common Market. They 
will also leave room for an "observance, though not necessarily a celebration," 
of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America, Shiley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much going on in '92," she said. "We didn't think the entire theme 
should be consumed by those (Columbus) observances." 
</P>
<P>
The broad theme was widely endorsed by members of the arts community at the 
July and August meetings, and its appearance on the city manager's report was 
applauded yesterday by Tom Hall, managing director of the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of those who encouraged the city to move toward a broad theme," Hall 
said. In planning for the 1989 Soviet arts festival, he said, the theater 
company had difficulty finding a range of quality productions to fit the theme. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the Old Globe has not begun planning for a festival yet.

'I KNEW I WAS ALIVE,' OFFICER TELLS OF BEING SHOT POINT-BLANK

On her off days, Ramona cowgirl Diane Hall prefers light pink denim, but at 
work she wears a police officer's shield and a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, that vest saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it stopped them," said Hall, referring to the vest that 
stopped two 9-millimeter bullets fired at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember hearing pops," Hall said during a press conference Tuesday in 
Ramona, an equestrian center in the background. "It was gunfire, but it wasn't 
a real sound to me. Then I remember getting hit in the chest, like with a 
baseball bat, but it didn't feel like getting shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like it happened to another person, it's so blurry." 
</P>
<P>
Hall and two other San Diego police officers responded to a burglary call at 
8:54 p.m. Sunday night in the City Heights area. They spotted Jimmie Ray Reeves 
Jr., 23, hiding in a cardboard box. When he tried to flee, a scuffle ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Reeves pulled a gun from one of the officers' holsters and began 
firing wildly, striking Hall in the stomach and right collarbone, and hitting 
her gun. 
</P>
<P>
Officers wrestled the gun from Reeves and, when he ran, all three officers 
fired their weapons, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves didn't say anything to the officers during the fracas, he was just 
"grunting and groaning," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he had a gun at the time, I just knew he was acting awful 
wild," Hall said. "I was grabbing his arm, and that's the one he shot me with." 
</P>
<P>
The incident took less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still remembering things. I remember rolling away and screaming for help," 
Hall said. "I understand I emptied my gun, but I don't know how many times I 
hit the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
After it was clear the danger had passed, Hall slumped against a wall to take 
stock of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was alive, but I didn't know how bad I was hurt. I really didn't know 
what my injuries were," said Hall, 40, who has been with the force for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Hall called to her partner, officer Cheryl Dean, to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted her to see what my wounds were, because I didn't want to check 
myself," said Hall, who suffered bruises, abrasions and powder burns. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and her husband, Ron, who is also a San Diego police officer, haven't had 
time to reflect on her brush with death, and instead have been answering phone 
calls from well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been so busy answering the phone, I haven't had a chance to stop the 
wheels and think about it," said Hall, who won't be going back to work "until I 
feel like going back." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hall was patrolling in Kearny Mesa when he heard the radio call that his 
wife had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out there at about Mach 3," said Ron Hall, 40. "I knew she was injured, 
but I could tell by her voice that she wasn't hurt too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Diane Hall's stomach muscles are sore, and she can't sit up without help, 
but she misses her horses most. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get back to riding," said Hall, who keeps three horses in the 
back yard of her Ramona home.

3 GUILTY OF RIGGING SUPERFUND TOXIC TESTS;

Three former employees of a La Jolla laboratory pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
charges that they falsified testing of soil samples from Superfund toxic waste 
sites, taking shortcuts that authorities say may have hindered the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's ability to judge which sites needed the most 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. William Braniff said the defendants admitted that, as employees of 
Science Applications International Corp.'s Environmental Chemistry Laboratory 
in La Jolla, they often provided false assurances that testing equipment had 
been calibrated to ensure accuracy. In addition, he said, because the lab was 
paid more if it met EPA deadlines, the employees backdated some results, 
overcharging the U.S. government about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were based on a 28-month inquiry that focused on about 1,000 test 
samples gathered nationwide in late 1987 and early 1988, Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff's announcement came less than one week after employees of a 
Missouri-based corporation pleaded guilty to similar charges, and Brooks 
Griffin, a regional director of the EPA Inspector General's office, said 20 
other investigations of falsified results are under way throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second case to reach this point," Griffin said. "But there will be 
many others to come." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the SAIC laboratory's former manager, Gary Smith, pleaded 
guilty in federal District Court to aiding and abetting the making of false 
statements to the EPA, a felony. The 42-year-old Encinitas man, who is 
scheduled to be sentenced in February, faces a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Two technicians under Smith's supervision, Celso de Oliveira and Larry Flynn of 
San Diego, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the conversion of government 
money -- when they backdated test results for profit -- a misdemeanor. 
Oliveira, 35, and Flynn, 39, were each sentenced to two years of unsupervised 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff said no decision has been made about whether to charge SAIC, a 
Virginia-based company that does extensive work for the U.S. government. The 
company, whose La Jolla labs had tested samples for the EPA since 1984, brought 
the fraud to the attention of law enforcement authorities, he said, after it 
conducted its own internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
SAIC has pledged to sell or close the lab, according to Griffin, and the EPA is 
no longer sending samples to SAIC. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff said that, during 1987 and 1988, all the laboratory's employees were 
involved in the scam -- about 25 total. He said some had been granted immunity 
and refused to say whether any more employees would be charged. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said that, after the criminal case is resolved, the EPA will file a 
civil suit seeking to recover triple the damages that it incurred as a result 
of the SAIC wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But more than money, Braniff said, "the real concern is the harm that these 
faulty (test) results can lead to. . . . Actions of this kind put us all at 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
FBI Agent Joseph C. Johnson, who participated in the inquiry, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The allocation of money to the cleanup of Superfund sites can vary from 
several millions to several billions of dollars, and the commitment of these 
funds is dependent on accurate, honest test results," he said. "The health and 
safety of our citizens are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
The tests conducted by the La Jolla lab were the basis for establishing 
priorities among sites so that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first; 
for determining the amount and identity of the toxic chemicals and for 
identifying the parties responsible from which to seek reimbursement or the 
cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the improper testing may have hindered the EPA's ability to judge the 
relative severity of different clean-up sites, officials said they were still 
evaluating whether there was a consistent pattern of under- or over-estimating 
the toxicity of the samples. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said that, despite the apparent broad scope of the fraud, he believes 
the public can have confidence in the Superfund program. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we discovered this problem, the attempts to overcome the errors 
commenced immediately," he said. "There are many systems the agency has to 
protect itself." 
</P>
<P>
Braniff said that those systems cannot be faulted because of the unlawful 
behavior of contractors. "No matter how you set it up," he said, "you have to 
rely on the integrity of people." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a laboratory in Earth City, Mo., pleaded guilty to one count of 
falsifying EPA-funded tests from 1987 to 1989. The company that owned the lab, 
TRC Cos., could be fined $500,000 and be forced to pay damages.

The supervisors Tuesday allocated $80,000 to improve security at the family law 
courts at the Vista Court Annex and El Cajon Regional Center. 
</P>
<P>
The airport-type security equipment, including an X-ray machine and 
walk-through magnetometer, will be installed within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The security systems are designed to detect weapons and other contraband. All 
people entering the courtrooms will be screened. Marshal's officers will 
operate the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors expressed concern that security needed to be improved at the two 
facilities in light of the number of weapons being confiscated at the family 
law court and juvenile court lobby in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Family law courts, which handle divorces and child custody, and Juvenile Court, 
which handles gang-related matters, are the most volatile areas of the local 
justice system, said San Diego County Marshal Michael Sgobba. 
</P>
<P>
Since the airport-type security station was put up in 1987 at the family law 
court downtown, the marshal's office has confiscated 4,469 knives, razors and 
other cutting weapons, 110 handguns, 126 Mace containers, 34 stun guns, 17 
blackjacks, 702 miscellaneous weapons such as hatchets, and ammunition, drugs 
and alcohol.

A San Diego police review board established by voters two years ago should be 
strengthened to become more independent and have greater authority to 
discipline police officers, San Diego City Councilman Wes Pratt said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said the mood is right for a stronger review board following the 
overwhelming citizen vote Nov. 7 to create a powerful review board to oversee 
the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will recommend to the city's Rules Committees that the City Council 
put a City Charter amendment on the November 1992 ballot that would strengthen 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's review board, which passed by a 2-to-1 vote, will have subpoena 
powers to compel witnesses to testify, much like the county grand jury. Members 
will be appointed by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Review Board on Police Practices, which voters approved two years 
ago, has no such power and has been criticized because its recommendations 
carry little weight.

A Rhode Island man pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal charges that he illegally 
obtained sensitive information about a drug-smuggling investigation from a U.S. 
Customs employee. Joseph Phillip Souza, 47, from Newport, R.I., could be 
sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine when he is 
sentenced Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the U.S. attorney's office, Souza obtained the 
confidential information from Customs employee David Henry Brown, 48, of San 
Diego. The brief report released by the U.S. attorney's office did not note 
whether Brown was an agent, inspector or office worker with access to Custom's 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
The information given to Souza was about an investigation of one of Souza's 
associates and was pilfered from the the agency's computer system. The U.S. 
attorney's report did not say if Brown was paid for the information or how long 
he worked for Customs. Efforts to reach officials at the U.S. attorney's office 
and Customs for more information were unsuccessful Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Brown pleaded guilty Oct. 29 to charges of illegally transmitting confidential 
information to Souza. He also faces 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 
fine. He too will be sentenced Dec. 20.

The Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved a licensing tax on businesses in 
unincorporated areas to pay for more patrols by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The annual tax will be a flat $25 for each business and $5 for each full-time 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
The tax is to go into effect in March. 
</P>
<P>
It will raise an estimated $500,000 to strengthen law enforcement in Valley 
Center, Julian, Pine Valley and the 4S Ranch, a community near Lake Hodges. The 
number of deputies to be hired has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The business tax is the first such fee imposed on businesses in unincorporated 
areas, although most cities in San Diego County already have similar business 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with opposition from numerous businesses and chambers of commerce in 
unincorporated communities this fall, supervisors considered several amounts 
and variations of the business tax. 
</P>
<P>
An initial proposal of a $100 flat fee for retail businesses and $150 for 
professionals, plus a $5 fee for each full-time employee and $2.50 for each 
part-time employee, would have raised more than $800,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors said they reluctantly adopted the fee after state budget cutbacks 
slashed millions of dollars from the county budget. Supervisors approved the 
measure after briefly debating the impact of the tax on businesses and the 
reduced number of deputies that could be hired by approving a $25-per-business 
tax instead of the $100 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors directed Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey to make 
recommendations in January on ways to find funding for more deputies in 
unincorporated areas.

Burbank-based Lockheed will benefit in two ways: It will gain access to JAL's 
aircraft maintenance technology, and the contract puts it in a good position to 
win future aircraft orders. In the meantime, the company may be riding the 
wings of a new trend of airlines giving aircraft state-of-the-art make-overs 
rather than purchasing new planes in a time of economic uncertainty. Japan

Out of Kitchen, Into Supermarket: While it's old news that supermarkets are 
luring customers from restaurants, what's new is that they are now recruiting 
restaurant managers, cooks and chefs. The workers are saying au revoir to their 
eateries and bonjour to Vons, Publix and other chains as they opt for higher 
wages, better benefits and shorter hours. The move to beef up supermarkets' 
food service departments is essential, as the departments account for about 10%

Bright Spot at Sears: Overall, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. may still be in a

Men's Store have been pleasant surprises. A senior executive vice president 
said that, in addition to the new format, Sears has been selling more apparel 
because of changes at the competition. When Dayton Hudson bought Marshall 
Field, Sears was able to grab about 20 of Field's buyers, who are "showing 
Sears some interesting things." Second, as J. C. Penney tries to move its image

believed to be the first time that a foreign firm has taken majority ownership

MCA, MATSUSHITA OFFICIALS TO BEGIN ACQUISITION TALKS

<P>
Top executives of MCA Inc. and Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. will 
meet in face-to-face bargaining here next weekend as acquisition talks between 
the companies head into what appears to be the home stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Both Matsushita President Akio Tanii and MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman are 
expected to attend the sessions, individuals familiar with the talks said. 
Company officials have exchanged financial information since word of 
Matsushita's plan to acquire MCA for as much as $8 billion surfaced in late 
September. But the chief executives have not negotiated directly. 
</P>
<P>
Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, Matsushita's chief 
representative in the talks, is also headed to New York for the discussions, 
sources close to the deal said. 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable source predicted that the acquisition "will be done by the 
end of November," but it remained unclear whether the companies were close to 
an agreement on price and other key points. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies formally declined comment on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
MCA executives have said the company hopes to get more than $80 a share from 
Matsushita and to boost the payout to stockholders as high as $90 per share by 
separately selling the company's New York-area WWOR television station to a 
buyer such as Chris-Craft Industries or Walt Disney Co., which are both said to 
be interested. 
</P>
<P>
But reports from Japan have suggested that Matsushita executives expect to pay 
closer to $70 a share for MCA. MCA stock closed Tuesday at $62.50, up 75 cents, 
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
According to several sources, the MCA contingent in the bargaining sessions 
will include Wasserman, President Sidney J. Sheinberg, Executive Vice President 
Charles S. Paul and company officials George Smith and Robert D. Hadl. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita is expected to send both Tanii and his top lieutenant, Masahiko 
Hirata, an executive vice president. It wasn't clear where the talks would be 
held. But one source said the first session was likely to occur on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
MCA is represented by the investment banking firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and 
the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. Matsushita has been 
represented by Ovitz and investment banker Herbert Allen of Allen &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment industry analysts said confidence in the deal is growing. Paul C. 
Marsh of the Los Angeles investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards said 
the stock has traded about as high as it can go without a deal actually being 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
"They've traded it to the limit," Marsh said. "There certainly is a strong 
feeling that there is going to be a deal."

MILKEN TELLS JUDGE HE DIDN'T SEEK FAME; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: IN AN EMOTIONAL LETTER ASKING FOR LENIENCY, HE SAYS HE FEARS GOING 
TO JAIL.

<P>
Michael Milken, in an emotional plea for leniency, has told a federal judge he 
"never sought notoriety" and was afraid of going to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I could do anything that would result in being a felon . . . 
but I did break the law. . . . I have no one to blame but myself," Milken said 
in a letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. The 11-page letter, dated Nov. 
5, was made public by the judge late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All people, I am sure, have a fear of incarceration and separation," Milken 
said. "I am not unique, and I too have those fears." 
</P>
<P>
He said he wrote the letter because he feels that he would be too emotional 
during his sentencing hearing to adequately express his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond 
department, pleaded guilty in April to six securities felonies. He faces a 
possible maximum sentence of 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he asked that he be allowed to use his skills to help children, 
pointing out that he has spent the past few years working with inner-city 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his reputation as a financial wizard, Milken is also known as a 
generous philanthropist, having donated millions to charities and worked 
personally with underprivileged youth. 
</P>
<P>
Although Milken was probably the most powerful and influential financier 
through the merger-crazy 1980s, he remains an unassuming family man who broke 
down in tears when he publicly admitted his guilt in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he asked Wood to let him return to his quiet life. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who I don't even know, whom I've never met, who call me a symbol of 
the 1980s or a symbol of money and power, I say I've never sought notoriety," 
he wrote. "Let me return to a life of anonymity if humanly possible for myself 
and my family." 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the most painful experiences during the past four years has 
been "the assault on the sincerity of my beliefs, my moral system and my basic 
inner being."

Southland Investors Sued: Two investors were accused of illegal stock trading 
based on information published in advance copies of Business Week magazine. 
Stephen Rasinski, a real estate investor from Newport Beach, and Lawrence 
Small, a former stockbroker from Pacific Palisades, were named in a Securities 
and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan. The 
lawsuit seeks more than $195,000 in alleged illegal profits that Rasinski and 
Small made on trades between September, 1986, and July, 1988, and penalties of 
up to three times their gains.

Creditors Want Eastern Liquidated: Creditors said ailing Eastern Airlines 
should be liquidated because it cannot become economically viable. The 
contention came in a U. S. Bankruptcy Court filing in New York opposing the 
Miami-based carrier's request to withdraw $30 million from an escrow account to 
operate through mid-December. Eastern rejected the creditors' contention.

LOOKING AHEAD: IT'S AN ERA OF 'INFORMATION APPLIANCES' 
</P>

The personal computer is quickly becoming the horseless carriage of the 
information age. Before the decade is out, the PCs on our desks will be 
replaced by workstations and PCs everywhere else by a host of "information 
appliances" -- inexpensive, radically accessible, high-performance information 
tools utterly unlike today's PCs. 
</P>
<P>
Today's personal computers are general-purpose tools into which most 
information is entered via keyboard and cleaned up on screen before being 
reduced to paper. The features that matter most on these machines are power, 
ease of use and the availability of software programs designed for particular 
kinds of tasks, such as word processing and spreadsheet calculation. For the 
most part, our PCs are stand-alone devices connected to little else than a 
printer or modem. Local area networks are becoming more common but more often 
than not are used simply to share a laser printer among multiple PCs. 
</P>
<P>
Workstations are generally more powerful than PCs, but the real difference is 
connectivity. Unlike PCs, workstations derive an ever-growing value from what 
they are connected to. The connection might be to a file server shared with a 
dozen other workstations or to a corporate database on a remote mainframe. 
Workstations thus become tools for examining and manipulating electronically 
delivered data, windows to a larger information world. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, workstations will be like telephones, their usefulness defined 
above all by what they link us to. A telephone on a desk unconnected to any 
other telephone isn't a telephone at all, but a paperweight. Workstations that 
fail to link us to the right information bases or networks will seem equally 
useless. There will be no shortage of variety in the power and features offered 
by workstation manufacturers, but we will choose among these options in much 
the same way that we select telephone desk sets. Some users will want the 
equivalent of a light, button-studded speaker phone; others will opt for a 
simple handset. 
</P>
<P>
The term information appliance is emerging as the shorthand for a new class of 
computing devices that, unlike PCs, are inexpensive, specialized and 
dramatically easier to use than the friendliest computer. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a hand-held device the size and shape of a thick legal pad. Its entire 
surface is a screen, on which users write with a stylus, their handwriting 
converted to computer-readable text on the fly. Add a cellular modem, and the 
device becomes a tool for trading information with one's office while on the 
road or using a plain-paper fax machine down the hall as a remote printer. 
</P>
<P>
At first this sounds like the ultimate laptop for executives who dislike using 
keyboards, but the "feel" of these appliances will be so different from today's 
PCs that no one will bother to make the comparison. Some functions will mimic 
paper-based tools such as calendars and note pads. Other activities will be 
new, such as a software "agent" that manages office messages or monitors 
external data such as stock prices and breaking news events. 
</P>
<P>
It will take the better part of the decade to turn this vision into reality, 
but the first stylus-based laptops are already being sold. Meanwhile, Silicon 
Valley and the consumer electronics industry are hard at work on other 
information appliance concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Sony recently introduced the Data Diskman, a $400 hand-held optical disk reader 
that displays words and numbers on a small liquid-crystal screen. The Diskman 
is a bit dull, but it hints at surprises to come. Imagine a pocket-sized 
aircraft maintenance "manual" that uses graphics, sound and motion video to 
display repair procedures, or an interactive encyclopedia employing the same 
technology to hold the attention of fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
It won't happen overnight, but the PC is headed the way of the Model T. 
Workstations will invade our desktops, and information appliances will slip 
into our pockets, our briefcases and our living rooms. Together, these new 
devices will deliver the computer revolution promised a decade ago.

STATE REAL ESTATE RECOVERY MAY BE SLOW, S&amp;LS TOLD 
</P>

Residential real estate markets in California will take another 18 months to 
recover, while the state's commercial real estate sector could be stuck in a 
downturn for another three years, real estate experts predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The news offered little encouragement to savings and loan executives here 
attending the annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the 
industry's main trade group. But a panel of real estate experts did predict 
that California will not suffer a New England-style real estate recession, and 
that the fallout for lenders will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the center for real estate and urban economics at 
UC Berkeley, said median house prices in some areas of California, which have 
already fallen from 4% to 6%, may drop another 5% to 10% before turning up. 
</P>
<P>
He said a Southern Californian forced to sell a home today would likely have to 
sell at a price 10% to 15% below the peak of early 1989. Rosen said he expects 
that lenders will see increases in late mortgage payments and foreclosures as 
they did during the 1981-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rosen said, California's slump differs significantly from New England's, 
where housing prices have dropped about 10%. Rosen said the New England real 
estate boom that preceded the current slump was driven by a huge growth in 
income, not population growth. 
</P>
<P>
California's boom, however, was driven by migration of people into the state, 
and that is expected to continue, Rosen said. He noted, for example, that 
California can expect a huge influx of people from Hong Kong before the colony 
is turned over to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Downs, a real estate expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, 
said commercial development is in a depression. He said the building boom of 
the 1980s, caused by such factors as easy credit and favorable real estate tax 
laws in the early part of the decade, caused so much overbuilding that it may 
take five years before builders start launching new commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We built too damn much space," Downs said. "We have got to absorb that space 
and it will take us a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Downs said, however, that the halt in new projects ultimately will have a 
positive effect because it will strengthen the market for existing commercial 
buildings.

Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank said Tuesday that they have agreed in principle to 
merge April 1 to form one of the world's largest banks, with deposits totaling 
about $177 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the merger is expected to prompt other banks to follow suit, 
triggering reorganization of Japan's banking industry amid globalization and 
liberalization of financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Kyowa and Saitama follows the merger of Mitsui Bank and Taiyo 
Kobe Bank in April of this year to form the world's second-largest bank, with 
combined funds of $232 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Kyowa, which ranks 10th among Japanese commercial banks, is strong in small-lot 
retail financing in the Tokyo area, while Saitama, ranked 11th, is the top bank 
in Tokyo's neighboring Saitama Prefecture.

PANEL SAYS REGULATORS IGNORED BAILOUT ADVICE

<P>
Top federal regulators ignored early warnings that the savings and loan 
industry cleanup could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, congressional 
investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 investigation by Dallas-based regulators warned that the bailout 
eventually could cost hundreds of billions, while senior regulators in 
Washington were estimating that it would cost just $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The report, just made public, indicates that "much more was known by the top 
regulators in Washington than was previously acknowledged about the extent of 
the thrift problems," said Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of a 
congressional task force on urgent fiscal issues. 
</P>
<P>
The report was available to top regulators two years ago, Schumer said. They 
ignored it, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if an army general discovered a ticking nuclear bomb under his 
compound, simply walked away and said, 'We'll worry about it later,' " Schumer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is compelling evidence that at least one top regulator was deliberately 
low-balling the estimate of the thrift bailout cost," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts now say the cost of the thrift cleanup could reach $500 
billion, including interest. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer also said the investigation found favoritism toward industry executives 
by directors of the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank, who often regulated the same 
thrifts at which they were themselves executives. The home loan bank system had 
responsibility for savings and loans before the system was restructured under 
the 1989 thrift bailout bill. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a cover-up of billions of dollars in losses, and company 
officials were paid multimillion-dollar bonuses "while the thrifts they 
controlled teetered near insolvency," Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The severity of these findings should have sent shock waves through Texas, the 
rest of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, the Administration, Congress and the 
American people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the study was left "on the dusty shelves of the top federal overseers in 
Washington," Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
The five officers from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati who carried out 
the 1988 investigation described the attitude of Dallas regulators as 
"lackadaisical." 
</P>
<P>
"After a few days, we developed what we called the Texas stare, we were so 
flabbergasted by what we saw -- the files in the bank were in disarray," said 
Gerald Summers, senior supervisory agent at the Cincinnati Federal Home Loan 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious the Dallas bank had a philosophy to under-report 
(thrift) losses," he said.

PEOPLE: VETERAN RETAILER LEN WILLIAMS TAKES PIC 'N' SAVE REINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pledging to return a bargain-basement flavor to Pic 'N' Save discount stores, 
veteran retailing executive Len Williams on Tuesday assumed the post of 
president and chief executive officer of the Dominguez-based retailer. 
</P>
<P>
His selection Monday ended months of pressure by dissident shareholders to 
replace Lewis B. Merrifield III, who at one time was chairman, president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Frankel, who replaced Merrifield as chairman for four months, resigned 
last week. He was succeeded by Peter S. Willmott, former chairman, president 
and chief executive of Carson, Pirie Scott &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a hard-core merchant," Williams said. "In a bargain-oriented store, 
impulse creates business, and mass creates impulse." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, former president of Caldor, a division of Associated Dry Goods, and 
former chief executive of Gold Circle, a division of Federated Stores, was 
elected unanimously, according to board member David Batchelder, who heads the 
La Jolla investment group that pushed for Merrifield's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 53, reported for work at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday and immediately launched 
plans to woo back shoppers who considered the messy, jumbled stores a 
bargain-hunter's paradise. Under Merrifield's guidance, management had 
organized the merchandise and tidied up the stores, which critics and some 
shareholders said hurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make the merchandise accessible and the stores really full," said 
Williams. He said the stores reported very strong Halloween sales and predicts 
that business will pick up as shoppers try to stretch their holiday dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who will be moving to Southern California from Westport, Conn., said 
he will be earning less than the $975,000 that Merrifield received. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be at a more market-related, realistic salary," he said. JANE APPLEGATE

HANDICAPPERS SET EARLY LINE ON SEASON'S FIELD OF 21 MAJOR MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Paramount's "The Godfather, Part III," Columbia's "Awakenings," Universal's 
"Kindergarten Cop" and Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady" are the four 
films likeliest to rack up the highest box-office grosses this Christmas 
season, according to people in the industry who bank on their ability to 
predict these things. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the schedule is more jammed than usual, with the major studios set 
to release 21 feature films, three more than last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The saying goes that the pie is only so big, that carving it into so many 
pieces will mean a smaller slice for each," said John Krier, president of 
Exhibitor Relations. "But everyone is hoping that the pie will get a little 
larger. There are so many pictures out there people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
So, which of these horses are going to break out of the pack? After talking 
with studio executives, producers, agents, marketing people and others in the 
business whose guessing games are more informed than others, here's a handicap 
of the field: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morning-Line Favorites: 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather, Part III" (Paramount, Dec. 25): An "event" film with tremendous 
"wanna-see," even more "wanna-love." Few believe it will be the work of art its 
Oscar-winning predecessors were, but who's going to skip it? 
</P>
<P>
"Awakenings" (Columbia, Dec. 20): A drama starring Robert DeNiro and Robin 
Williams, reportedly at the top of their form, this Penny Marshall film is said 
to pack a lot of emotional punch. DeNiro and the film have been mentioned as 
Oscar contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Kindergarten Cop" (Universal, Dec. 21): Insiders say this action-comedy, which 
re-teams director Ivan Reitman with his "Twins" star Arnold Schwarzenegger, has 
received incredibly high marks at research screenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena Vista, Nov. 21): The sequel to the 
studio's 1987 Christmas hit, "Three Men and a Baby," has also tested well and, 
as a sequel, has a built-in audience coming in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contenders: 
</P>
<P>
"Edward Scissorhands" (20th Century Fox, Dec. 7, limited opening): Fox is high 
on this modern-day, off-kilter fable directed by fantasy-king Tim Burton 
("Batman," "Beetlejuice"). Though Johnny Depp is supposed to be terrific and 
research screenings have gone well, not everyone is convinced: "Show me a film 
that Depp has opened, let alone sustained," said one producer. "And good 
reviews only bring you grosses like 'Avalon.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Misery" (Columbia-Castle Rock, Nov. 30): This ultra-scary psychological 
thriller, adapted by William Goldman from a Stephen King novel, has reportedly 
played even better with research audiences than director Rob Reiner's last film 
-- "When Harry Met Sally." Sources say it will revive James Caan's career and 
make a star of film newcomer Kathy Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia House" (MGM-Pathe, Dec. 19 limited): Word is the movie, adapted from a 
John le Carre novel, moves slowwwwwly. But the novel was one of the author's 
most successful and accessible, and no one is betting against the pairing of 
Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Green Card" (Buena Vista, Dec. 25 limited): A comedy produced, directed, and 
written by Peter Weir starring the ubiquitous Gerard Depardieu and Andie 
McDowell ("sex, lies, and videotape"). Disney believes it's another "Pretty 
Woman." Industry insiders give it a chance of filling one of the five best 
picture Oscar spots on February's final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" (Orion, Dec. 14): A coming-of-age story featuring Cher, Winona Ryder 
and Bob Hoskins, said by some to be Ryder's movie. There were well-publicized 
problems on the set (Richard Benjamin is the third director) and early 
eyewitness reports are decided mixed. "People are still fascinated by Cher," 
says one producer. "But Benjamin, who hasn't performed in a major way since 'My 
Favorite Year' has to be considered a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
"Havana" (Universal, Dec. 12, limited): A Sydney Pollack love story set against 
the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford and Lena Olin ("Enemies, A Love 
Story"). Redford is said to deliver his best performance in years, but the buzz 
is that there is little chemistry between the glamorous stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dark Horses: 
</P>
<P>
Other films may have tougher going, if the conventional wisdom is borne out. 
Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking Too" (Dec. 14) -- high interest and awareness 
notwithstanding -- could find its inventive gimmick wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "Come See the Paradise" (Dec. 12), a World War II drama about an 
interracial relationship, is said by one eyewitness to be "the first truly 
boring film Alan Parker has made." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice," (Orion, Dec. 25, limited) is characterized as one of Woody Allen's 
more minor films, while Fox faces an uphill battle trying to sell "Predator 2" 
(Nov. 16) without Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. Warner's "The 
Rookie" (Dec. 7) is perceived as a benchmark film for Clint Eastwood, an actor 
whose popularity as an action star has been on the decline. "If it takes off, 
his franchise will regain some luster," said one producer. "If it fails it'll 
be 'next chapter.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Warner's "The Sheltering Sky" (Dec. 7, limited), Bernardo Bertolucci ("The 
Last Emperor") reportedly elicits exquisite performances from his cast (Debra 
Winger and John Malkovich) but seems more comfortable on the epic scale than on 
an intimate one. "The fact that Warner Bros. didn't screen it early says to me 
that there's something slightly rotten," said an executive at a rival studio. 
</P>
<P>
Warners has another tough sell with "Hamlet" (Dec. 19, limited). Not only is it 
Shakespeare, but the casting of Mel Gibson in the lead has reportedly drawn 
laughs in theaters where the trailer has been shown. Still, the word on 
Gibson's performance is good and director Franco Zeffirelli has been a master 
at popularizing works of the Bard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longshots: 
</P>
<P>
As always, there's talk of some clinkers. Paramount's "Almost An Angel" (Dec. 
19.) is said to be an unfortunate departure for "Crocodile Dundee" duo Paul 
Hogan and wife Linda Kozlowski. MGM-Pathe's "Rocky V, The Final Bell"(Nov. 16) 
has been called "the major groan of the Christmas season," an expensive 
embarrassment to a studio with a paucity of riches. 
</P>
<P>
Research screenings of Brian De Palma's "The Bonfire of the Vanities" (Warner 
Bros., Dec. 21) have reportedly not gone well. One eyewitness called it a 
"cartoon" of a film and questioned whether the material was suited to De 
Palma's blood-and-guts style. "Everyone is asking if Brian can find a way to 
mutilate a woman in it . . . Melanie Griffiths watch out," said a producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Out of the Gate: 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves" soared on opening weekend, turning in a 
per-screen average of more than $40,000. Industry analysts believe it will hold 
steady when it's released wide in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Outside: 
</P>
<P>
Independent films will also be jockeying for position. Among them, Miramax has 
three entries: Merchant/Ivory's "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" (Nov. 23, limited), a 
slow but tasteful art house film co-starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; 
"The Long Walk Home" (Dec. 25, limited), a well-intentioned civil rights drama 
starring Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg; and "The Grifters" (Dec. 5, L.A. 
one-week Oscar-qualifying run), a dark comedy with great performances by 
Anjelica Huston and Annette Bening considered a bit downbeat for holiday fare. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Classics is set to release "Cyrano" (mid-December in L.A.), a lush French 
production that won its star, Gerard Depardieu, the best actor award at Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
No word at all on Bruce Beresford's "Mr. Johnson" (Avenue, Dec. 12), but 
referring to its setting of road building in West Africa in the 1920s, one 
producer quipped: "They ought to put speed bumps in the aisle . . . to prevent 
people from leaving in droves."

SCULPTURE: THE LATEST COUP BY THE GETTY MUSEUM IS ITS ACQUISITION OF A BRONZE 
BY DUTCH SCULPTOR ADRIAEN DE VRIES. THE PIECE WAS RESCUED FROM AN AUCTION OF 
GARDEN STATUARY.

The latest star in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum is neither a 
prime painting by Vincent van Gogh nor a monumental Greek sculpture of 
Aphrodite, but it's very big news in the art world. "Male Figure," the Getty's 
new bronze by Dutch sculptor Adriaen de Vries,caused a sensation last winter 
when it was rescued from an auction of ordinary garden statuary and it 
subsequently commanded the whopping price of $10.7 million, a record auction 
price for sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-inch-tall nude figure had languished in the English country garden of an 
unidentified elderly gentleman who bought it around 1950. He consigned it to a 
sale of garden sculpture in Sussex, at an estimated value of $2,000 to $3,000. 
Elizabeth Wilson, Sotheby's sculpture specialist, spotted the valuable piece in 
the auction catalogue and transferred it to a much more distinguished sale in 
London. Sotheby's trumpeted the news and the art world watched when London 
dealer Cyril Humphris made the winning bid at a Dec. 7 auction. 
</P>
<P>
Great discovery. Record price. End of story -- until this week when the Getty 
announced that it had quietly purchased the rescued masterpiece and had put it 
on display at the museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
What took so long? First, there was the standard six-month waiting period for 
an export license, required by British law for the removal of valuable 
artworks. (The law is intended to stem the tide of exported treasures by giving 
the British time to match the price paid by foreign buyers.) When the sculpture 
finally arrived in Malibu, it had to undergo treatment for corrosion in the 
museum's conservation laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Now that "Male Figure" holds a commanding position in the museum's grand 
gallery of Old Master paintings, curator Peter Fusco minces no words about the 
status of the new acquisition. "It's the most important bronze from the late 
15th Century through the early Baroque period to come on the market in years," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are only four significant bronzes by De Vries in America and two of them 
-- "Male Figure" and "Rearing Horse," acquired a few years ago -- are at the 
Getty. The other two are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Fusco said. 
</P>
<P>
De Vries, who was born in the Hague in 1545, studied with Florentine master 
sculptor Giambologna and became court sculptor to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague. 
That city was once the major repository of De Vries work, but about 200 of his 
bronzes were taken to Sweden as war booty in 1660 and they remain there, Fusco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Male Figure" depicts a muscular nude juggler at a precarious moment. Holding 
juggler's plates -- one right side up and the other upside down, with the help 
of centrifugal force -- the agile figure stands on his left foot while pumping 
bellows with his right foot. The pose was inspired by a Hellenistic marble 
"Dancing Faun," which is now at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, but the faun 
plays cymbals with his hands and pumps a foot organ, Fusco said. 
</P>
<P>
De Vries' version, which was executed around 1610-1615, is thought to be an 
allegory about balance, enacted by a figure performing a balancing act while 
striking a pose that stretches aesthetic concepts of balance. "The figure is 
extremely animated and balanced at the same time. It's not often that you find 
a sculptor doing something new and doing it so consummately well," Fusco said. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture is highly regarded for its rarity and ingenuity, but its value is 
heightened because it is a unique piece, like all of the artist's bronzes. 
Although De Vries used the lost wax process of casting, which allows for 
duplicates, he did not make molds and is not known to have produced more than 
one of any of his works, Fusco said. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty this week also announced the acquisition of another Baroque bronze, 
"The Abduction of Helen by Paris" by Italian artist Giovanni Francesco Susini 
and put it on display. The museum purchased the 1627 sculpture from a French 
dealer who bought it for $3.6 million at a Paris auction on April 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Using a subject from Homer's "Iliad," Susini has depicted the Trojan prince 
Paris kidnaping Helen, queen of Sparta -- a move that led the Greeks to declare 
war on Troy. In the 26 3/4-inch bronze, Paris sweeps Helen off her feet and 
fends off another nude woman who has fallen on the ground. All serpentine lines 
and three-dimensional action, the dramatic sculpture shows the influence of 
Gianlorenzo Bernini, the leading figure of the Italian Baroque period. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty's unveiling of the De Vries and the Susini is only the latest 
evidence that the museum has built an astonishingly fine bronze collection in 
the last six years, since Fusco became the museum's curator of sculpture and 
works of art. Fusco has also helped the museum to extend its decorative arts 
well beyond the 18th-Century French period that J. Paul Getty favored. 
</P>
<P>
"We have acquired about 70 sculptures, 72 pieces of glass, 40 pieces of 
ceramic, 20 pieces of Italian furniture and 35 metal works including jewelry 
and silver," Fusco said. The collections are not the biggest in the country, 
but the museum has distinguished itself "in terms of masterpiece quality," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Frick-like collection with select groups of objects on a very high 
level," Fusco said, referring to the prestigious Frick Collection in New York. 
The sculpture collection, which is now one of the finest in the country, 
includes marbles and bronzes by such major figures as Antico, Cellini, 
Giambologna, Bernini, Houdon and Canova. 
</P>
<P>
Fusco was associate curator of European painting and sculpture at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art for 10 years before coming to the Getty. He had 
hoped to build a collection of Renaissance and Baroque bronzes for LACMA but 
that proved to be too expensive, so he concentrated on later, less pricey 
sculpture. At the Getty he decided to go for "earlier objects rather than later 
ones because of their rarity. You have to grab them while you can. Also these 
pieces complement the County Museum of Art's collection from later periods," he 
said 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of our glass, maiolica (Italian Renaissance ceramics) and 
bronzes," Fusco said. "Our success with sculpture was a surprise because I had 
no idea what would come on the market. I feel that I've been very lucky. I've 
had great support from (former director) Kenneth Donahue and (director) Rusty 
Powell when I was at the County Museum of Art and from (director) John Walsh 
and the board here at the Getty. Kids coming out of graduate school who want to 
build a collection now find that museums have been priced out of the market."

</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: THE HAMBURGER CHAIN ATTEMPTS TO PULL ITSELF OUT OF THE FRYING PAN 
WITH AN AD TRUMPETING THE CORPORATION'S DEVOTION TO 'TRADITIONAL AMERICAN 
VALUES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What did it mean? 
</P>
<P>
The half-page ad -- echoing the tone of loyalty oaths that cowardly television 
networks made their employees sign during the "Red-scare" frenzy in the decade 
following World War II -- appeared in several hundred newspapers Nov. 4-5. Out 
of the blue. No explanation. 
</P>
<P>
This was the title: "An Open Letter to the American People." 
</P>
<P>
This was the text: 
</P>
<P>
"Burger King wishes to go on record as supporting traditional American values 
on television, especially the importance of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the American people desire television programs that reflect the 
values they are trying to instill in their children. 
</P>
<P>
"We pledge to support such programs with our advertising dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The ad was signed: Burger King Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was heartening to learn of Burger King's devotion to "traditional 
American values" -- it just chokes you up -- why would the giant hamburger 
chain feel the need to proclaim its "pledge" to the nation? 
</P>
<P>
The case has all the earmarks of a corporation choosing profits over principle 
by gutlessly caving in to a pressure group, the way much of the entertainment 
industry in the postwar years cowered before extremist, Red-hunting sleuths out 
of fear of political and economic reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
The Burger King ad that ran in The Times and elsewhere surfaced following an 
eyeballing confrontation between Burger King and Wheaton, Ill.-based Christian 
Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV). 
</P>
<P>
The ad spoke for itself: Burger King had blinked. 
</P>
<P>
CLeaR-TV, a self-described coalition of about 1,600 Christian leaders, 
announced on Sept. 1 that it would boycott Burger King, charging the company 
with being a "leading sponsor of network TV sex, violence, profanity and 
anti-Christian bigotry" during the May ratings sweeps. No specifics were given. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling the sizzle from a conservative religious group with apparent economic 
clout, Burger King didn't take long to react. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we learned about the boycott, we started having meetings with CLeaR 
representatives," Burger King spokesman Michael Evans said from the firm's 
Miami headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were at the table because of the boycott," boasted CLeaR-TV's chairman, 
the Rev. Billy Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
There were two meetings, the first Sept. 27 in a Chicago hotel, the second on 
Oct. 17 at CLeaR-TV's Washington, D.C., office. Two weeks after the second 
meeting, CLeaR-TV called off its boycott, and five days after that, Burger 
King's "open letter to the American people" began appearing in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are fuzzy about what happened in the two meetings and why the 
boycott was dropped. But draw your own conclusion about Burger King: If it 
crawls like a groveler and whines like a groveler, it usually is a groveler. 
</P>
<P>
What promises did Burger King make to CLeaR-TV? "I'm not aware of any promises 
about anything," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the company to prescreen programs (on which they advertise), and we 
believe sincerely they will follow through in avoiding programs that have 
excessive sex, violence and profanity," Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always prescreened shows," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would seem that CLeaR-TV's two-month boycott was too skimpy to 
profoundly affect Burger King revenues, Melvin insists that it was "very 
clearly effective." Burger King "had franchise people who were screaming," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Burger King denies that. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, placing the ad was "an internal business decision" made only 
"indirectly" in response to the boycott, Evans said. "The decision to run that 
ad was ours. It wasn't part of any deal. We were concerned that there were a 
lot of misconceptions in the minds of our consumers and that there were 
hundreds of thousands of them out there who didn't see the news release (from 
CleaR-TV) calling the boycott off." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to define the "traditional American values" that the ad says Burger King 
supports, Evans seemed at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an evolutionary thing," he said. "Values have changed. We're for 
programming that reflects the mainstream of our consumers. We do not wish to 
offend any population group." 
</P>
<P>
Melvin had no trouble supplying a definition: "I think of a man and a woman not 
engaging in premarital sex until they are married, of a man and woman 
committing themselves to this relationship the rest of their lives, of children 
respectful of their parents, parents spending time with their child to build a 
good home. I think of such virtues as honesty, decency, fair play, justice." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the gap often separating some of these ideals and reality. 
"That doesn't mean you don't hold up the ideal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The values reflected in numerous May sweeps programs on which Burger King 
advertised are "destructive," Melvin said. "They are bad for the country. They 
are destroying the quality of life here. When someone tells me to turn off TV 
or flip the channel, what they really are asking me to do is walk away from 
something that is destructive and evil." 
</P>
<P>
Yet asked to list the "destructive and evil" Burger King-sponsored programs 
that offended CLeaR-TV, Melvin could provide no specifics. However, he said the 
CLeaR-TV's list was "in sync" with the 18 Burger King-sponsored programs 
attacked by the American Family Assn., based on its own monitoring of the May 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
The American Family Assn. is a Christian watchdog organization headed by the 
Rev. Donald E. Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., a veteran campaigner against what he 
considers to be smut and anti-Christian prejudice in TV and the arts. Wildmon 
is also a co-founder and executive director of CLeaR-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Although Melvin denied that Wildmon controls CLeaR-TV, he said that Wildmon 
attended both meetings with Burger King, and Evans maintained that "Wildmon is 
CLeaR." 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon's charge of an anti-Christian bias on TV is not without foundation, and 
now more than ever, the industry is begging for a backlash by gratuitously 
increasing sexual content even in early evening sitcoms in hopes of competing 
with the generally raunchier cable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Wildmon group's list and accompanying capsule reviews of offending May 
sweeps programs that Burger King helped sponsor often borders on the 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
It includes ABC's showing of Oliver Stone's anti-Vietnam War film, "Platoon," 
for example, faulting it not only for its "hopelessness," but also for its 
violence and "profanity." It also attacks an episode of the former CBS Vietnam 
series "Tour of Duty" for its "profane language and graphic violence," 
including "explosions and tortured, writhing bodies." As if profanity and 
violence were not the essence of war. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon's group also hits ABC's "thirtysomething" for showing the estranged 
couple Nancy and Elliott in bed together after they have separated. ("At the 
end of the show, they are getting back together," the association reports, as 
if there was something anti-family about married couple's resolving their 
differences.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the NBC drama "People Like Us" is criticized for its positive 
portrayals of two gay characters and its negative portrayal of an anti-gay 
character. Wildmon's group also notes: "A major part of the plot included a 
movie star committed to raising funds for AIDS research." Tsk tsk tsk. 
</P>
<P>
Burger King is only one of 10 corporate sponsors that CLeaR-TV contacted 
concerning their advertising support of programs the group found objectionable. 
Melvin would not identify the others, but said seven had convinced CLeaR-TV of 
their good intentions and that "we're in contact with the other two." 
</P>
<P>
CLeaR-TV is now monitoring the November sweeps. Would Melvin suggest that other 
corporate sponsors buy newspaper ads endorsing "traditional American values" on 
TV as Burger King has done? "That's for them to decide," he said.

AT THE GALLERIES: ART DIALOGUE IS A TALE OF TWO GALLERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look carefully and you can witness an exchange between artists of different 
worlds, different generations, different eras. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue has been staged at two local institutions, the Timken Art Gallery 
in Balboa Park, which houses a collection of European and American art made 
through the end of the 19th Century, and the San Diego Museum of Contemporary 
Art (SDMCA) in La Jolla. For a period of just more than two months, each museum 
has sent the other two paintings from its permanent collection to hang among 
works that relate in style to works from the other's collection. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of "compare and contrast" exercise is one of the art historian's best 
friends, although it is more often done through illustrations in texts and 
slides in lectures. It is a way to fine-tune critical sensibilities, to draw 
distinctions and definitions. The method has its pitfalls, however. It can 
easily be too facile, bringing works together that share only the most 
superficial of features. At best, though, the thoughtful juxtaposition of works 
can act as a catalyst for fresh insights. Each work can illuminate aspects of 
the other that might be left unseen in another context. 
</P>
<P>
The Timken/SDMCA exchange, through Jan. 2, accomplishes this synergistic feat 
with grace and modesty. Only four paintings change hands in this phase of the 
exchange program -- two more exchange shows will follow, the next will open in 
February -- but the impact feels much broader, for the show plants the 
tempting, sweeping notion in the viewer's mind that all art is, on one level, a 
conversation among artists. This continuous visual dialogue obeys no 
chronological or geographical boundaries; its mutterings vibrate wherever art 
is made and shown. 
</P>
<P>
At the Museum of Contemporary Art, echoes of the past resonate loudly in Odd 
Nerdrum's 1987 painting, "The Sleeping Twins," now hanging next to the Timken's 
"Christ on the Cross," by Bartolome Esteban Murillo and "Saint Bartholomew," by 
Rembrandt van Rijn. 
</P>
<P>
All three paintings share a dark, earthy atmosphere, their human subjects 
emerging from these somber depths with an otherworldly glow. Christ, in the 
Murillo, appears pale and waxen but ethereal against a vast sky of steel gray 
clouds. Saint Bartholomew's strong features catch only a raking, golden light 
in Rembrandt's characteristically dense, dark brown space. 
</P>
<P>
Nerdrum, a contemporary Norwegian artist, paints with the same dramatic 
intensity as the Spanish and Dutch old masters. He basks his strangely cocooned 
twin women in a soft, ivory light and lays them down on an ambiguous, earthen 
bed. Despite the secular nature of his subjects, Nerdrum shares with his 
aesthetic forebears a penchant for evoking the spiritual in the palpably 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
At the Timken, "House," a 1984 painting by the former San Diegan Robert Ginder, 
is now hanging in a gallery of icons. This work, too, aggrandizes and 
spiritualizes the mundane. As with Nerdrum, it is Ginder's painting technique 
that bolsters this effort and may even carry it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Ginder mimics the methods and materials of medieval icon painters in his image 
of a humble, typical Southern California abode, a single-story white stucco 
with a Spanish-tile roof, fronted by a lawn and large palm tree. He paints the 
house on a heavy wooden panel, arched on top and cracked to suggest age. 
Instead of carrying through with the naturalistic painting style used to depict 
the house and its surrounds, Ginder represents the sky with a layer of luminous 
gold leaf similar to that used in the surrounding icons to denote the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
This self-conscious straddling of the past and present, the heavenly and the 
earthly, startles and amuses but also prompts substantive questions regarding 
the nature of the American dream and the distinctions between material and 
spiritual wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Another jarring juxtaposition can be found in the Timken's gallery of American 
paintings. There, among the sublime landscapes of Albert Bierstadt and Jasper 
Cropsey, hangs a quietly disturbing work by contemporary New York painter 
Stephen Hannock, also from the SDMCA's collection. In his "Vortex at Dawn" 
(1990), Hannock assumes the same reverent, distanced gaze and preoccupation 
with light as the 19th-Century Luminist painters in his midst, but Hannock's 
concerns are distinctly of this century. 
</P>
<P>
The spiraling cloud in his otherwise still and serene seascape is not a natural 
phenomenon but one that deviates, especially in spirit and intent, from the 
natural order. As the wall label explains, Hannock's subject is the 
self-destructing Trident II missile. The wondrous explosion peaks in a burst of 
light at the spiral's center. Its beauty gives no hint of the violence taking 
place. 
</P>
<P>
While the other paintings in the Timken's American gallery celebrate the 
marvels of creation -- from a simple magnolia blossom to the grandeur of 
Yosemite Falls -- Hannock's pays homage to the spectacle of destruction. It 
describes without cynicism the capacity of man to create beauty and evil in a 
single gesture, to evoke awe and revulsion simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
The meaning of both Hannock's work and those surrounding it is amplified by the 
anachronism of their display together. The same holds true for the other 
juxtapositions between new and older works in this first phase of the 
Timken-SDMCA exchange. The program makes visible the animated challenges and 
heady homages, echoes, inspirations and revolts that link artists of disparate 
worlds. In doing so, it restores to the museums' collections an excitement 
that, these days, is usually left to the blockbuster show.

COMPOSER KNOWS THE SCORE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE OSCAR-WINNING MAURICE JARRE HAS ANOTHER HIT ON HIS HANDS WITH 
'GHOST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With more than 100 major scores behind him, 66-year-old film composer Maurice 
Jarre enters the fifth decade of his career with little sign of tiring. This 
year, not only has he scored four new movies, but last month the sound-track 
album to one, "Ghost," crept into the Top 10 of the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very funny. We have to compete with heavy metal," said Jarre, with a 
laugh, during a break in recording sessions for the new Paul Hogan comedy 
"Almost An Angel" at Columbia Studios in Culver City. "I think the success of 
the 'Ghost' sound track was a combination of a lot of things. The Righteous 
Brothers have done a fabulous rendition of their song 'Unchained Melody' and 
also there's the success of this romantic comedy itself." 
</P>
<P>
Jarre's most recently released sound track, for the supernatural thriller 
"Jacob's Ladder," also combines an old American song -- Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy" 
-- with original music, to eerie, supernatural effect. The score's mix of 
electronics, strange instruments and musical styles is vintage Jarre. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning, I have always liked to mix ethnic instruments in my 
music," he said. "Not necessarily to emphasize the ethnicity of the film. For 
example, I don't use an oud because it is an Arab film or the bongos because it 
is Mexican. But I hear very interesting things in ethnic music, numerous points 
of sound. In 'Jacob's Ladder,' we had an interesting sound with a Japanese 
instrument called the shakuhachi. When you use that strange sound, it gives it 
a sort of nightmarish quality." 
</P>
<P>
Jarre credits Southern California for supplying him not only with the latest 
technology in synthesizers, but a multicultured variety of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is just the place," he said. "You can find anything here. For 
'Jacob's Ladder,' we had this marvelous sarangi player from India who just 
happened to be touring here. When these French snobs say, 'Maurice, how can you 
survive in Los Angeles? It is such a cultural desert.' I say, 'Oh really? How 
many times did you go to a concert last month?' And they say, 'Well, I was very 
busy.' I say, 'I was very busy, too, but I went to hear an orchestra from 
Cologne, one from Canada, an ensemble of Chinese instruments and dance from 
Thailand.' But there is cultural snobbery everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Originally a composition student of Arthur Honegger at the Paris Conservatoire, 
Jarre started his career as a percussionist and composer, often collaborating 
on background and incidental music for the stage with composer-conductor Pierre 
Boulez. His earliest sound tracks from the early 1950s include films by Georges 
Franju and Alain Resnais. 
</P>
<P>
But it was in 1962 that he became an international celebrity with his 
Oscar-winning score to British director David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia." His 
other two collaborations with Lean, "Doctor Zhivago" (1965) and "Passage to 
India"(1984), also earned him Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
Jarre, who has lived in Los Angeles for 26 years, has worked on films from 
eight different countries, including the People's Republic of China. In 
addition to masterfully written and conducted orchestral scores, his pioneering 
use of electronic music makes him a significant innovator in his field -- from 
the use of ondes martinot in "Lawrence of Arabia" to his finely-honed ensemble 
of synthesizer wizards in movies like "After Dark, My Sweet" and "Jacob's 
Ladder."

EX-THATCHER ALLY TO BID FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY IS EXPECTED TO POSE THE MOST SERIOUS 
CHALLENGE SINCE SHE TOOK REINS IN 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine will run against British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in 
what is expected to be the most serious challenge to Thatcher since she took 
over the party in 1975, close colleagues reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, a member of Parliament and a firm Europeanist, is expected to 
announce his candidacy today, according to widespread reports in London 
political circles. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's popularity has been at a near-low recently because of aspects of her 
domestic and European policies as well as her authoritarian rule in a nation 
used to a more collegial government. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine's candidacy is expected to be bitterly opposed by the prime minister 
and leading members of her Cabinet, because of the dangers such a hard-fought 
contest will pose to the party in the next national election. 
</P>
<P>
But his position was thought to have been bolstered Tuesday by Geoffrey Howe, 
former deputy prime minister, who before a packed House of Commons explained 
his reasons for his surprise resignation 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
In what observers called a scathing and devastating indictment, the normally 
placid Howe said the prime minister was "risking the future" of the country by 
her negative attitude toward the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, the last minister left from Thatcher's original Cabinet, explained that 
his position in calling for Britain to play a leading role in the community was 
constantly undermined by the prime minister's anti-European remarks. 
</P>
<P>
He contrasted the positive, pro-European approach of former Tory Prime 
Ministers Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan against what he called the 
negative "background noise" and "nightmare image" coming from Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said her view of Europe was that it was "positively teeming with 
ill-intended people scheming to extinguish democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of vision is that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Howe's remarks were the more effective for the understated, almost diffident 
way he stated his case, referring to her as "my right honorable friend." 
</P>
<P>
Some embittered pro-Thatcher Tories called Howe's unexpectedly damning speech 
an "incitement to mutiny" and an "act of treachery." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Thatcher had appeared highly confident of any possible party 
contest and used phrases from cricket that vowed to knock any challenger out of 
the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to that analogy, Howe on Tuesday declared that the Conservatives were 
like a team that found their "bats broken by the team captain before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Under Tory party rules, Conservative members of the Commons will vote probably 
within a week on a leader in a secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If Heseltine wins a majority -- 159 votes -- he would become party leader, and 
Thatcher would be forced to step down as prime minister, though there is no set 
time limit to remain in the post. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Conservative Party began at the Rome summit of the European 
Community late last month when Thatcher was outvoted 11 to 1 on setting a 
timetable for the second phase of European monetary union in agreeing to 
establish a central bank by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
She described the Rome proceedings as "cloud-cuckooland," and when she spoke in 
the House of Commons the following Tuesday, the prime minister was equally 
blunt in her assessment of her EC colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
That was too much for Howe, who as foreign secretary had worked strenuously to 
make Britain a cooperating member of the EC -- before Thatcher summarily fired 
him from the job last year. 
</P>
<P>
He turned in his surprise resignation on Nov. 2, which generated speculation 
about a challenge to the Thatcher leadership. That turned the focus to 
Heseltine, 57, who had stalked out of the Cabinet in January, 1986, in a 
complex dispute over the sale of a British helicopter company. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine's lieutenants in the House of Commons say they have at least 100 sure 
votes for him, which would not win the leadership -- but would not be a 
humiliating defeat.

</P>
<P>
Michael Glen Armour, 31, of San Diego, was apprehended by Harbor Police who 
spotted him running a short distance from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Armour was turned over to San Diego police and was being held in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Kona Inn robbery happened about 2:20 a.m. It was not known how much money

BODY FOUND DUMPED OFF SIDE OF ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police were investigating the death of a man whose bludgeoned body 
was found Tuesday dumped off the side of a road in the hills above Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified body, believed to have been that of a man between 30 and 35 
years old, was found about 2 p.m. in a brushy area below the road in the 7800 
block of Mulholland Drive, Lt. Ron LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was 6 feet tall with short brown hair and mustache, and wore a red, 
short-sleeved shirt with stripes, gray shorts and white tennis shoes, Detective 
Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was unknown but the case was being handled as a homicide. 
Coffey said the victim appeared to have been hit several times in the upper 
torso, and possibly the head, with a blunt instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that he was dragged to the edge and then pushed over the side," 
LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was 70 feet below the road on a steep hillside, wrapped in a blanket 
or sleeping bag. At least one person saw it as early as 7 a.m., Coffey said, 
"but they didn't know it was a person." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who lives in the area "got a closer look around 1 p.m." as she walked 
along the road, "thought it might be a body" and called police, he said.

FATHER HELD IN TWO FIRES AT DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL 
</P>

The father of a Clairemont preschooler was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of 
setting two pre-dawn fires at his child's school in the past week, fire 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities would not disclose the motive behind the alleged actions, but said 
the man was arrested at Metro Arson Strike Team headquarters after being taken 
there for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Kirt Raft, 27, was booked into County Jail on suspicion of two counts of arson, 
Metro Arson Strike Team Capt. Jim Smidt said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wee Care Preschool was scheduled to reopen Tuesday in its new location next 
door to the original school at 3580 Mt. Acadia Blvd., Smidt said. An arson fire 
Friday shut the school, and school officials spent the long holiday weekend 
moving into the new classrooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a second blaze Tuesday morning at 3578 Mt. Arcadia, squelched the 
reopening plans. Firefighters were called to the school about 4:15 a.m. and 
brought the blaze under control by 4:34 a.m., Smidt said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of Tuesday's fire was still under investigation, Smidt said. Smoke 
and fire damage was estimated at $150,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flammable liquid was used to start Friday's fire, which caused about $40,000 
damage to several classrooms in the two-story wood-and-stucco building, Smidt 
said. It took 41 firefighters about half an hour to contain that blaze, which 
broke out at 3:30 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter suffered minor injuries battling last week's blaze, but did not 
require hospitalization, Smidt said. Separate businesses situated on the second 
floor of the building also sustained smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 children attend the preschool, which has been in business at the Mt. 
Acadia address for eight years.

POWAY SUES S.D. FOR REOPENING OF POMERADO ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway officials filed suit Tuesday in Superior Court to force a speedy 
reopening of Pomerado Road, a popular shortcut for commuters from Ramona and 
Poway to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Poway City Atty. Stephen Eckis said the city's plea will be heard Dec. 7 by 
Judge Jeffrey T. Miller, who might order the road reopened at that time. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Council members last week reversed their decision to reopen the 
road, which has been closed for two years for realignment and reconstruction, 
after San Diego city attorneys John Witt and Curtis Fitzpatrick issued an 
opinion that the city could honor its pledge not to reopen Pomerado until 
another direct route linking Poway to Interstate 15 was built. 
</P>
<P>
Eckis, in Poway's petition seeking an injunction, said San Diego acted 
illegally in refusing to reopen the road when construction was completed. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the California Vehicle Code, which provides that cities may regulate 
traffic through or around a street only during the actual performance of work 
of construction unless it is found that "the street is no longer needed for 
vehicular traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Pomerado Road, which carried about 6,100 cars a day before it was closed by San 
Diego in November, 1988, formerly was a part of U.S. 395, the federal route 
linking Riverside and San Diego, Eckis pointed out, and is predicted to have a 
daily traffic count of 34,000 vehicles a day by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway attorney argued that San Diego's failure to reopen the road "is the 
result of arbitrary and capricious action taken contrary to law." 
</P>
<P>
Poway is seeking an order by the judge to reopen Pomerado Road and a temporary 
and permanent injunction to prevent the city from closing it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on San Diego council members to keep the road closed comes from the 
upscale suburb of Scripps Ranch, which lies along the southern part of 
Pomerado. 
</P>
<P>
The Scripps Ranch community plan calls for closure of Pomerado until a 
four-lane expressway, known as South Poway Parkway, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
That road was delayed when San Diego officials put off plans of developers who 
are committed to build the expressway. 
</P>
<P>
It is not expected to be built and open for traffic before the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Eckis pointed to two conflicting opinions issued by the San Diego city 
attorney's office, one by Witt and Fitzpatrick supporting the continued closure 
and one issued in May by Deputy City Atty. John Riess stating that continued 
closure of the road after completion of construction violates state law.

S.D. GENERAL SEEKS 'STANDBY' EMERGENCY ROOM STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego General Hospital has asked the state to downgrade its emergency room 
to "standby" status, in hopes of stemming a flood of red ink and keeping the 
facility alive until it can be converted to a nonprofit facility. 
</P>
<P>
The move would relieve San Diego General, formerly called Physicians &amp; 
Surgeons, of the day-to-day burden of caring for the approximately 350 patients 
who arrive by ambulance each month. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the other 1,150 patients seen in the emergency room every month, 
these patients are poor. They often have no insurance at all, or are covered by 
public programs such as Medi-Cal, which do not reimburse fully for care. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change comes several months after the expiration of an agreement 
the city of San Diego imposed before approving the sale of the hospital in May, 
1989. This required the new owners to keep the emergency room open under full 
status for a year after the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
If San Diego General goes on standby status, ambulances would take patients to 
other nearby hospitals instead, including Paradise Valley, Mercy and UC San 
Diego Medical Center. In some cases, the hospital would also seek to transfer 
severely ill patients who did not arrive in ambulances, said James Zanca, 
associate administrator of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Such transfers require the permission of the receiving hospital, however. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the change cannot occur without state approval, which would come within 
the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Zanca said it is possible that within that time the hospital will find a way to 
avoid the downgrading. If it does occur, he added, hospital officials are 
hoping it could revert to full-service status within 90 days after the 
downgrading. 
</P>
<P>
But the state also will consult with officials of other San Diego hospitals, 
the county Department of Health Services and medical societies before approving 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the emergency room's status is the first time in the Southeast 
San Diego hospital's rocky history that the emergency room has been downgraded. 
</P>
<P>
It also is the same tactic taken by Harbor View Medical Center in 1983, when it 
faced similar financial troubles. That emergency room remains a "standby" 
facility, and the hospital appears to have succeeded in rescuing itself from 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
A group of investors from the Riverside County community of Perris bought 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons in 1989 from National Medical Enterprises, one of the 
largest health-care firms in the nation. Principals in the for-profit firm are 
Benjamin F. Davis Jr. of Coronado and John Motte of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Because of continuing financial difficulties at the hospital, a consultant 
hired in the summer is working to turn the hospital into a nonprofit concern. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that can be done by January, Zanca said.

NORTH COUNTY TO GET MOBILE TRAFFIC OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minor traffic offenses will be processed more quickly in the North County under 
a plan approved Tuesday by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to spend $26,800 to put a mobile van, complete with computer 
equipment and staff, at various sites in the North County Judicial District to 
process minor traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
The mobile satellite traffic office will operate under an agreement among the 
county, the state Department of Motor Vehicles and Camp Pendleton, which is one 
of the van's initial locations. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors chose to use the van to ease the pressure caused by population 
increase on the North County Municipal Court and to avoid leasing more space 
for the court's San Marcos branch, which opened in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in January, the mobile van will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
although those hours could be changed according to customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos branch processes more than 600 people a day, with often more 
than 175 waiting in a line that spills into the parking lot. The backup is 
creating congestion in the court and along California 78, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Clerks in the mobile office will accept bail or fine payments and proof of 
correction or insurance, assign or accept proof of traffic school assignments, 
and accept not-guilty pleas for later appearances at the San Marcos branch. 
</P>
<P>
When the program begins, the van will move between Camp Pendleton, the DMV in 
Oceanside and the Sheriff's substation in Encinitas. The days the van will be 
in each location have yet to be announced. The sites were selected because of 
the many traffic citations issued to Oceanside and Encinitas residents. The 
mobile van will also be stationed in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities will review the program after three months to determine the best 
sites and hours and established a regular schedule. Officials also will 
consider putting the van at other locations and whether a permanent satellite 
office should be established, said Sharon Lear, assistant court administrator.

SANTA CLARITA OKS A CAP OF 6% ON RENT INCREASES AT MOBILE HOME PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Santa Clarita City Council members approved a tough ordinance Tuesday night to 
limit rent increases at mobile home parks, saying retirees and low-income 
families need the protection. 
</P>
<P>
The product of 10 months of negotiations between city officials, park owners 
and residents, the ordinance originally proposed an 8% cap on yearly rent 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
But the council, to the delight of about 200 mobile home park residents who 
packed the council chambers, unanimously lowered the cap to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will tie rent increases to the consumer price index, up to a 
maximum of 6% annually. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were philosophically uncomfortable with rent control 
but had to protect low-income residents who could not afford spiraling rents in 
the city's 17 mobile home parks. "It isn't that we want to put in rent 
control," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy told park owners in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour hearing, park residents pushed for the 6% cap and seven other 
modifications to the ordinance. David Evans, a member of the Western Mobile 
Home Assn., a park owners group, complained that the residents had negotiated 
in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we need to start all over again," Evans said. "I feel like we've 
been betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
Formal negotiations on the ordinance between park owners and residents began in 
February, but the foundation for the measure was laid in 1988 when owners of 
the 60-space Desert Gardens Mobile Home Park announced they were shutting down 
the park to build a shopping center. Because of the area's rapid growth, the 
site had become ideal commercial space, the owners said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, mobile home residents predicted that the demise of Desert Gardens 
would set off a spate of closures, with park owners trying to cash in on 
rapidly rising property values in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In response to pleas from mobile home park residents, the City Council passed 
an emergency moratorium on park closures. When the measure expired this past 
summer, the council revamped its zoning ordinance to make it more difficult to 
close a mobile home park.

SAMPSON DEAL MAY BE NEAR 
</P>

<P>
Ralph Sampson reports to Arco Arena every day with the same hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been waiting," the Sacramento Kings' center said. "Every day I come 
in here and hope (player personnel director) Jerry Reynolds will come up to me 
and say, 'We traded you somewhere.' I just wish that could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson, 30, says his desire to leave the Kings has nothing to do with ill 
feelings toward the team or the city of Sacramento. He just wants to play and 
sees little chance of that happening with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson may or may not be traded, but he and the Kings may be getting close to 
an agreement that would allow the eight-year veteran to become a free agent, 
Reynolds hinted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some mild interest in several places," Reynolds said, "but I don't 
think it's a trade possibility, so we have to look at other ways. For us, we'd 
have to get some help on the salary part of it, some restructuring (of 
Sampson's contract) to make it feasible for us. If we're going to help him and 
help another team, then we want to be helped." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said Sampson has been good about the ongoing negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty close to getting done," Reynolds said. "I think it's a 
fairly good possibility that something may work out by the end of the week. I 
know (managing general partner Gregg Lukenbill's) position is pretty clear. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants maybe a little more compromise from Ralph or the other team," 
Reynolds said of Lukenbill, who did not return phone calls. "He wants, 
basically, a little fairer deal for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Teams willing to gamble on Sampson want the Kings to carry the brunt of his 
$2.247 million contract this season and the remainder of the approximately $5.7 
million owed Sampson the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the teams want us to carry all of it," Reynolds said. "Some are more 
realistic. I think it's getting closer with a couple of teams who are getting 
more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson is willing to restructure his contract but is not willing to sit on the 
end of the Kings' bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I play ball, and I was awarded my contract through my play," he said. "It had 
nothing to do with Sacramento. They accepted that, and they have to deal with 
it. They've talked about restructuring my contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been talked about. From giving me land, from me extending my contract a 
number of years and decreasing the amount and from me taking deferred payments. 
If they want to deal, they can deal with me. I've got some smarts. If they 
want, they can sit down and talk to me or my agent (Pro Serv Inc.'s David 
Falk). And I will extend it, but it's going to cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to restructure to go somewhere else," Sampson said. "No, I 
wouldn't do it to stay here and not play. I wouldn't do it to stay here and 
play. Why should I? I wouldn't have to. I'm already here. I'm already on the 
team. (Lukenbill) doesn't want to back out on the contract; he just wants to 
decrease his responsibility for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll say, 'Well, we'll give you a piece of land, we'll buy you out,' " 
Sampson said of Lukenbill. 'We'll give you half the value of the contract and 
you go on about your business.' " 
</P>
<P>
"That's impossible," Sampson said. "Why take half when you can get it all?" 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said Sampson may have to pay for his free agency and the accompanying 
ability to deal with any NBA teams. Whatever deal the Kings and Sampson reach, 
simplicity will not be an applicable description. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something you do quickly," Reynolds said. "I know fans will say 
just do it, but this is a major undertaking. Something where we can benefit 
somewhat and Ralph can benefit to where everybody thinks at least it's fair. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where it is now," Reynolds said. "It's not quite fair for us and not 
quite fair for Ralph or what he thinks is fair." 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, the San Antonio Spurs and the Charlotte Hornets have expressed 
interest in Sampson. Reynolds said the Los Angeles Lakers and the New York 
Knicks also have shown mild interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ralph were a free agent," Reynolds said, "there'd be some other teams that 
would be interested on a look-see basis. You know, prove it to me and then 
we'll do something. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, which he understands, he would be in a very good position for himself 
if, in effect, he could become a free agent," Reynolds said. "What we're saying 
is for that possibility, it's going to cost you something." 
</P>
<P>
If the Kings were to release Sampson, only half of this season's salary would 
be available to them under the salary-cap agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Playing has not been a thrill Sampson has been able to enjoy this season. Coach 
Dick Motta has chosen to give Sampson only two minutes of playing time in one 
game of five. Some may speculate that the Kings are playing a waiting game with 
Sampson, hoping the center will get antsy sitting on the bench and ask for a 
deal in hopes of playing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But Sampson said he is patient. 
</P>
<P>
Motta said he has not played Sampson because he does not figure into the team's 
youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision I face is, is he going to be in our plans two or three years from 
now," Motta said. "The minutes I give him that I take away from Duane Causwell 
... are they beneficial to us? 
</P>
<P>
"(The front office) has been working on a deal for a month," Motta said. "If 
the deal goes down, then he's not going to be here. We've committed pretty much 
to that. Now if this deal doesn't go down, then I've got to re-evaluate. That's 
the only fair way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't over the summer and up until even now figure in our plans," Motta 
said of Sampson. "If Ralph still thinks he can play, for his benefit and 
everybody else's, it would probably be better for him if he could play 
somewhere else right now." 
</P>
<P>
Before training camp, Sampson said he was told by team president Rick Benner 
that the club and Motta wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
"(Benner) told me they wanted to see me play, but then they hardly played me in 
the preseason," Sampson said. "But Motta has wanted me out of here since last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson, a three-time NBA All-Star and the Most Valuable Player of the 1985 
All-Star Game, has been hampered by knee problems the past four seasons. 
Sampson no longer dominates play by being basketball's most mobile 7-footer. No 
longer does Sampson jump from one side of the lane to the other to block a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Portland's Buck Williams saw Sampson play during the preseason. Williams, who 
attended Maryland, played collegiately against Sampson, who graduated from 
Virginia, during the '79-80 and '80-81 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Ralph," Williams said, "many times, he was favoring his knees. What 
people don't understand about Ralph Sampson's ordeal here is that he really 
should be commended for trying to make a comeback from the injuries he's had. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of many players that would have tried to make a comeback from the 
injury he had considering the seriousness of it," Williams said. "Right now 
he's quite limited because he's favoring his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was healthy, he could shoot the basketball very well from the 
perimeter," Williams said. "He could post up, dunk and dribble. And now he's 
unable to get into his moves at all. He had so many moves and now to be limited 
..." 
</P>
<P>
Williams shook his head. His teammate, Clyde Drexler, chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy with that talent," Drexler said, "you've got to give him more time to 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
So Sampson has gone from being compared to the game's greatest scorer, Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, to playing behind Bill Wennington, Eric Leckner and Causwell. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson has had three arthroscopic surgeries, the last in December 1989, and 
since has undergone constant rehabilitation. His weight-lifting has resulted in 
more upper-body and leg strength than ever. But the questions observers have 
regard his ability to get up and down the court and hold his position while 
battling the league's behemoths. Nevertheless, Sampson believes he is ready to 
contribute to a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can play 48 minutes a night," Sampson said. "But I think I can 
play 20, 25, 30 minutes a night and be somewhat productive on a team and help 
somebody out."

WELCH WINS CY YOUNG AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
AL: OAKLAND'S 27-GAME WINNER BEATS OUT CLEMENS, STEWART. NO ONE IS NAMED ON ALL 
28 BALLOTS.

<P>
Bob Welch had the success, if not the statistics, of Roger Clemens and Dave 
Stewart. On Tuesday, he got the Cy Young Award to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
Welch was the American League's biggest winner in 22 seasons, with a 27-6 
record for the Oakland Athletics. And victories are what usually win the award 
for the best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
In a strange and split vote in which no one was named on all 28 ballots, Welch 
got 15 first-place votes and a total of 107 points. Clemens, with an earned-run 
average more than a full run better than Welch, was second with eight 
first-place votes and 77 points. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, Welch's teammate, also had a better ERA and won 20 games for the 
fourth consecutive season, but again failed to win the Cy Young. He was third 
with three first-place votes and 43 points, followed by record-setting Chicago 
reliever Bobby Thigpen, who had the other two first-place votes and 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd like to have the other thing, the World Series championship, but this is 
a more personal thing," Welch said. "You just feel fortunate that people 
recognize you." 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Baseball Writers Assn. in each AL city voted, and balloting 
was completed before the start of the postseason, in which Oakland's bid for a 
second consecutive World Series title ended with a sweep by Cincinnati. The 
National League Cy Young winner will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, Welch was one of baseball's most consistent pitchers for 12 
years, although he never won more than 17 games. It didn't look as if he would 
improve on that when, fighting the effects of the lockout, he went 0-3 with a 
17.72 ERA in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
In Welch's first start of the season, he gave up a leadoff home run to 
Minnesota's Dan Gladden. But Oakland's outstanding defense, the Athletics' 
excellent relief corps and the spacious Oakland Coliseum benefited Welch, who 
went on to set a club record for victories as his team won the West 
championship. He never lost two consecutive decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it, with me it's all between the ears," Welch said. "It's all 
mental." 
</P>
<P>
Welch's 27 victories were the most in the AL since Denny McLain won 31 in 1968. 
Not since Steve Carlton won 27 for Philadelphia in 1972 had a major leaguer won 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
Welch did it with a 2.95 ERA while pitching only two complete games -- both 
shutouts -- in 35 starts. In 238 innings, he walked 77, struck out 127, gave up 
26 home runs and 214 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens was 21-6 with a 1.93 ERA -- only the second Red Sox pitcher in 73 years 
with an ERA under 2.00. He missed almost all of the final month with tendinitis 
in his shoulder, although he did complete seven games, including four shutouts, 
in 31 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, a two-time Cy Young winner, pitched 228 1/3 innings and struck out 
209, walked only 54, gave up only seven home runs and yielded 193 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart went 22-11 with a 2.56 ERA. He pitched 11 complete games, four for 
shutouts, in 36 starts. In 267 innings, he struck out 166, walked 83, gave up 
16 homers and 226 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart finished third in the Cy Young voting in 1987 after going 20-13, was 
fourth in 1988 after being 21-12 and was runner-up last season after going 
21-9. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, at least Stewart helped prevent Clemens, his longtime rival, from 
winning this year -- Stewart won all three head-to-head meetings with Clemens; 
without those games, Clemens was 21-3 with a 1.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Welch got 10 second-place votes, three third-places and was left off one 
ballot. Clemens had 10 second-place votes, seven thirds and was left off by 
three voters. 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen, who set a major league record with 57 saves in 64 chances and had a 
1.83 ERA, was named on 10 ballots. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley, who got 48 saves 
in 50 tries and had an 0.61 ERA, received a pair of third-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Vida Blue (1971) and Catfish Hunter (1974) also won the award while pitching 
for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have an end like we did with the World Series, that's really the 
focus," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who recently filed for free agency, did not say if he will re-sign with 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, 34, broke into the majors with the Dodgers in 1978 and was traded to 
Oakland after the 1987 season.

MELVIN DURSLAG: IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF ALL THOSE AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With spectacular lack of anticipation, if not with pain, we brace ourselves 
this time of year for that annual American function called the Heisman Trophy 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
Ballots have been circulated for the purpose of determining what is labeled the 
outstanding college football player in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The theory here has been and always will remain that it will be a better 
society when awards are abolished. They are handed out capriciously. They cause 
bitterness among the deserving who are overlooked. They create false values. 
</P>
<P>
The Heisman is singled out for its overplay, but we reject other awards with 
equal passion. 
</P>
<P>
Heisman people needn't be offended. Our revulsion of awards is 
all-encompassing. 
</P>
<P>
Well, running a historical tracer on the Heisman Trophy, occupying such stature 
in national affairs, we find it is named for the late John Heisman, who gets a 
law degree at Penn but chooses the existence of itinerant football coach, 
touching base at Oberlin, Akron, Auburn and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
His next stop is Georgia Tech where, on Oct. 7, 1916, he displays the sporting 
spirit winning the heart ineradicably of the Downtown Athletic Club of New 
York, which he later would serve as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Heisman's team at Georgia Tech beats Cumberland, 222-0. 
</P>
<P>
No such score was known before; no such score has been known since. 
</P>
<P>
So, a student of disasters, including the Hindenburg and the Johnstown Flood, 
we get in touch with historians at Georgia Tech who, from the archives, dredge 
out information showing that Heisman leads Cumberland, 63-0, in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, he scores 63 more, meaning he is edging out Cumberland 
at halftime, 126-0. 
</P>
<P>
But it is clear that Heisman isn't of a mind to pour it on. In the third 
quarter, he scores only 54 points, raising the count to 180-0. 
</P>
<P>
And the final quarter is a veritable laydown. Heisman rings up but 42 points, 
his team ending the game with 32 touchdowns and 30 conversions. 
</P>
<P>
We are informed by Georgia Tech that Heisman's team gives Cumberland such a 
working over that Cumberland the following week against Wofford is able to put 
but 10 men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
In order for the game to go on, Wofford must lend Cumberland a player. 
</P>
<P>
"And what happened?" we inquire. 
</P>
<P>
"Cumberland wins, 3-0," we are told. 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, makes Cumberland the comeback team of the century and casts a 
shadow on the Downtown AC, which would pay homage to the architect of the worst 
massacre in football history. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech is going to a bowl game this season. Decency would dictate its 
players wear armbands, commemorating the diamond anniversary of the Cumberland 
butchery. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech should also pay reparations. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how heavy the hoopla, how golden the honor is painted, the 
Heisman award will never impress us, because no method of selection for such 
decorations is exact enough to be just. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, one guy is happy and maybe 24 others angry and feeling cheated. 
</P>
<P>
If awards were expunged from this earth, everyone would be happy. There would 
be fewer speeches and less contempt for the system. 
</P>
<P>
Do you realize that Michael Milken, Charles Keating and Ivan Boesky have 
received awards? The former owner of the San Diego Padres, C. Arnholt Smith, 
was elected "Mr. San Diego," just before he was charged with 64 counts of bank 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Awards have cascaded upon George Steinbrenner. And Donald J. Trump? Tons of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
This awards habit, this curse upon American life, must stop, beginning with the 
Heisman Trophy. On the hands of the winners is seen the blood of Cumberland 
College.

MANNING IS PUT ON INJURED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Manning, who had played in only two of the six Clipper games this season 
because of tendinitis in his right knee, was put on the injured list Tuesday 
and will miss at least five more games. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ball, who was with the Clippers in training camp before being waived, is 
expected to join the team today as Manning's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ball played two games with Wichita Falls, Tex., of the Continental 
Basketball Assn.

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
OUT-OF-SHAPE KRUTOV MAY BECOME OUT OF SIGHT SOON 
</P>

<P>
The Cold War might be over for the rest of the Soviet Union, but not for 
Vladimir Krutov. 
</P>
<P>
His battle, however, is with one small segment of the Western world -- the 
National Hockey League in general and the Vancouver Canucks in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Krutov has become a hockey player frozen out of his own sport, a Russian living 
in self-imposed exile from the ice. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year-old left wing with a dozen seasons on the Central Red Army team 
behind him, Krutov signed a contract with the Canucks last season for two years 
plus an option season. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in the flush of euphoria over the Soviet invasion of the NHL, but 
his numbers, like many of his fellow transplants, were less than spectacular in 
his first NHL season. Krutov had 11 goals and 34 points in 61 games for 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in training camp this year out of shape and overweight, and Canuck 
officials fumed. 
</P>
<P>
When he didn't look much better in the exhibition season, his days in Vancouver 
seemed over. The Canucks were ready to send him to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entire management team has had enough of him," said Brian Burke, the 
Canucks' director of hockey operations. "After repeated and stern warnings, he 
showed up at training camp in horrendous shape, and we all decided we can't 
tolerate it anymore. . . . It's nothing less than sad for everyone, the hope we 
had for him, the reception our fans gave him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was right there on the table for him." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Krutov, who reported 10 pounds overweight at 205, the only 
thing on the table he seemed interested in was food. 
</P>
<P>
End of Krutov, end of story? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when the Soviets arrived last year, some of their contracts 
included clauses forbidding trades or shipment to the minors. Such clauses are 
not permitted in standard NHL contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Soviet contracts, including the one signed by Igor Larionov, 
Krutov's teammate in Vancouver, have since been reworked to exclude the 
prohibitions on trades or demotions. 
</P>
<P>
But not Krutov's. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem. The Canucks don't want him, but they can't legally 
get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? So far, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Krutov has not been in a Vancouver uniform since opening day, nor has he been 
paid a penny of his $375,000 salary this season. 
</P>
<P>
Krutov, who does not speak English, has remained in Vancouver, working out with 
a local university team. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Ice Hockey Federation has gotten involved in negotiations to work 
out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
There are four possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviet officials will order Krutov home because he has become an 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviet officials will order him to go to the minors in order to collect 
his money -- the Soviet government also receives $375,000 a season from the 
Canucks for Krutov's services and it may consider the money the prime 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The issue could go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A buyout could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Krutov remains in limbo, the hockey player who refuses to come in 
from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Tough Call: The Winnipeg Sun, in a headline, calls the Kings' Tomas Sandstrom 
"Public Enemy No. 1." Labeling him "the most hated NHL player" because of his 
tactics on the ice, the article says: "Militant Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
should be so hated." 
</P>
<P>
Tough Call II: The Toronto Maple Leafs followed up Friday's trade of center 
John McIntyre to the Kings for center Mike Krushelnyski with the shipping of 
center Ed Olczyk and wing Mark Osborne to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for 
wing Paul Fenton and defenseman Dave Ellett. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk was at a Toronto hospital, awaiting the birth of his second child, when 
the deal was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Not wishing to have him hear the news through the media, a Maple Leaf official 
called Olczyk while his wife, Diana, was still in labor. 
</P>
<P>
"I held off telling my wife because I just wanted her to worry about the 
labor," Olczyk said. "But she knew something was up. She just looked at me and 
said, 'Where are we going, Winnipeg?' I said, 'Yes.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was thrown off the roller coaster for a minute. But then I got back on track 
and realized the most important thing was my family." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Ice: Some people have expressed reservations about the NHL's $50 million 
fee for expansion teams, but Godfrey Wood is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Part of a group attempting to land a franchise for Miami, Wood is undaunted 
despite the fact a group in Milwaukee recently pulled out of the expansion 
derby, citing the financial difficulties involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't happen to agree with any of (their) reported reasons," Wood told the 
Boston Globe. "I don't see how you can lose money, given the league's 
requirements (for arena size and season-ticket sales) and the southern Florida 
market area. We've got 4 million people to draw from, and our reports show they 
are just dying for hockey." 
</P>
<P>
Dying for fans: Expansion groups are not the only ones interested in this 
potentially lucrative territory. 
</P>
<P>
The new management of the Minnesota North Stars, beset by low attendance and 
morale problems, is reportedly looking at Florida as well. 
</P>
<P>
And the Winnipeg Jets, supposedly headed for Anaheim last year, are rumored to 
be on their way to Wisconsin next season, perhaps under new management, to fill 
the void left by the Milwaukee group's exit from the expansion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? Existing teams in trouble at home could get all the benefits of 
enthusiastic new fans and a shiny new home without the $50-million expansion 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the league might not look too kindly upon such carpetbagging, but as 
Al Davis proved, so what? 
</P>
<P>
Add expansion: Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings doesn't think the $50-million 
fee is exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
"Not when you figure that baseball is talking about $95 million to $100 million 
for an expansion team," he said. "We've got nine groups prepared to pay that 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is, we want to take our time and bring in the right 
people, not just grab the money." 
</P>
<P>
Monopoly game: Although the season is only six weeks old, Pittsburgh Penguin 
center John Cullen's moving to the top of the scoring list is news. 
</P>
<P>
It's only the second time since 1982-83 that anyone except Wayne Gretzky or 
Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux has led the NHL in scoring this far into the season.

SPORTFISHING LAUDS BANNING OF GILL NETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS and RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
How will the passage of Proposition 132 affect sportfishing off the Southern 
California coast? 
</P>
<P>
The local gill net fleet largely targets halibut and white seabass, two species 
heavily fished for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California and a former 
deputy director of the Department of Fish and Game, said he expects a better 
balance between commercial and recreational interests. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been out-competed in areas where the fish have traditionally been 
located," Fletcher said, citing as an example a regular phenomenon that occurs 
around the northern Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The squid will move in and begin their spawning, and what comes with the squid 
but the white seabass and halibut," Fletcher said. "Usually, you don't know for 
sure when that's going to happen. It comes sometime during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sportfishing) boats are running there every day, carrying a handful of 
passengers and catching a few rockfish and just getting by. All of a sudden, 
we're there one day and bingo. We make a catch and the word is out. All of a 
sudden there's nets crisscrossing the area, and the nets pretty much put us out 
of business." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said the ban will give recreational fishermen an opportunity to 
compete on a more equal basis with the commercial fishing operations "because 
they will have to be, most likely, using hook and line or something similar to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
George Valenzuela, owner of San Simeon Sportfishing, said he has noticed 
dramatic improvement in fishing the waters off the Central California landing 
since the area was closed to gill nets last February. 
</P>
<P>
"The gill netters would disperse the bait fish, and that's not the case 
anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The squid phenomenon mentioned by Fletcher was credited for the off-season, 
hit-and-run bite of white seabass off Santa Cruz Island last Friday, when all 
35 anglers aboard the sportfisher China Clipper nailed limits -- a total of 105 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
So Fred Geiger of Agoura Hills went fishing for white seabass in the same place 
Saturday but landed a saltwater line class, world-record yellowtail: 57 pounds 
9 ounces on 30-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger, aboard the private boat Hard Drag owned by Tom Palmer of Thousand Oaks, 
landed the fish in 20 minutes at the Yellow Banks, using live squid. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me down to about an eighth-spool before I could turn him," Geiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger first weighed the fish ashore unofficially at 63 pounds, then had it 
certified 22 hours later at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach. The record 
listed by the International Game Fish Assn. is 54 pounds 8 ounces, by Danny 
Jackson at San Benitos Island, Baja California, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Grant of Channel Islands Sportfishing at Oxnard said it was "unheard of to 
be catching white seabass this late in the year." 
</P>
<P>
The bite was back to an occasional white seabass by the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Saunders, also of Channel Islands, said: "White seabass are like that. A 
big factor is the amount of traffic. They're real shy fish. The (China Clipper) 
was all by itself. The next day, it was a mess (of boats) out there." 
</P>
<P>
But with live squid plentiful, yellowtail have been consistent, running larger 
than average, including several to 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
FLY-FISHING -- The "Fly-Fishing Fair" is scheduled Saturday and Sunday, 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. each day, at Bob Marriott's store, 2700 Orangethorpe, in Fullerton. 
Experts will present free instruction in casting and fly tying for all levels 
of experience, plus seminars on travel and photography. The lineup includes 
Lefty Kreh, Dave Whitlock, Poul Jorgensen, Lani Waller, Les Eichhorn, Jimmy 
Nix, Nick Curcione, John Randolph, Darwin Atkins and Bill Blackstone. . . . 
Gary LaFontaine, guide and instructor at the Fenwick Fly Fishing School in West 
Yellowstone, will be at the Long Beach Casting Club's monthly meeting at 7:30 
tonight at Recreation Park. LaFontaine also will appear at the Sierra Pacific 
Flyfishers' dinner meeting at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at the Odyssey Restaurant in 
Mission Hills, after a two-hour seminar at that location, starting at 3:30 p.m. 
The seminar is $20, the dinner $20 for non-members. 
</P>
<P>
HUNTING -- Otay Lake near San Diego continues to produce for duck hunters. On 
two open days last week, 67 of 99 hunters collected limits, bagging a total of 
302 ducks -- mostly widgeons, bluebill, gadwall and mallards. . . . The 
California Outdoors Foundation will have a family day fund-raiser Saturday, 
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., at Raahauge's Pheasant Hunting Club in Norco. Scheduled: 
Free instruction for novices, special shooting events, live country music. 
Information: (714) 735-2361. 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN FISHING -- Ron Beaton, owner of radio station KIEV, and Arnold Gold of 
Encino placed second as a team in the Redbone bonefish/redfish tournament at 
Islamorada, Fla. Beaton caught the biggest bonefish -- 10 pounds and 31 inches 
long -- and Gold tied for first place with three bones released. . . . An 
11-day trip with 25 anglers by the American Angler sportfisher out of San Diego 
produced 169 yellowfin tuna, 93 wahoo, 116 dorado, 34 yellowtail and a marlin. 
The boat worked Thetis Bank, U.S. Bank and San Benitos Island. . . . Easy daily 
limits of dorado from 5 to 15 pounds are being reported at the East Cape out of 
La Paz. Michael Arrebalo of San Diego took a 245-pound blue marlin and a 
137-pound striper fishing out of a hotel panga -- the latter just after the 
boat ran out of gas. Sailfish are the main billfish fare, although stripers are 
coming on since the first of the season's north winds blew through a week ago. 
Most of the blues are staying deep.

There is still a chance that UCLA will play in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference has informed UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis that 
there might be an opening in the Dec. 27 Liberty Bowl at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The conference also mentioned a possibility of a berth in the Independence Bowl 
in Shreveport, La., but UCLA rejected that because preparation for the Dec. 15 
game would have interfered with final examinations, Dec. 10-14. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force is tentatively scheduled to play the loser of the Ohio State-Michigan 
game in the Liberty Bowl. But, if Air Force (5-5) loses at Texas El Paso (3-6) 
Saturday, and UCLA (5-5) beats USC, the Bruins would land in the Liberty Bowl. 
NCAA rules prohibit teams with a losing record from playing a bowl game.

SMITH'S PREFERENCE IS MARINOVICH, BUT . . .; 
</P>
<P>
USC: FOLEY REMAINS IN COMPETITION TO START AT QUARTERBACK FOR THE TROJANS 
AGAINST UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Marinovich and Shane Foley will compete for the starting quarterback job 
this week as USC prepares to play UCLA Saturday in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Larry Smith seemed to indicate Tuesday that his preference would be 
to go with Marinovich, who was lifted in the second quarter of Saturday's game 
against Oregon State and didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the two of them, I don't think there's any question that Marinovich is 
best suited for our offense because we want balance," Smith said. "Marinovich, 
from that standpoint, gives you the best mixture." 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith added, it is difficult to ignore Foley's efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
A seldom-used backup player before Marinovich was suspended by Smith last month 
for cutting class, Foley completed all nine of his passes against Oregon State, 
throwing for 115 yards and two touchdowns in a 56-7 victory at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich completed three of eight passes for a career-low 23 yards, missing 
on five of his last six before Smith pulled him in favor of Foley. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich faltered because he lacked patience, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"You always want a quarterback who will gamble and go for big plays, but 
there's a time and place for it," Smith said. "I need the consistency -- take 
what (the defense) gives you." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he hoped to use only one quarterback against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a two-quarterback guy," he said. "I don't believe in musical chairs at 
quarterback. I would much prefer to go with one guy and go the whole way with 
him. But sometimes circumstances don't allow you to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Has the talent level at UCLA dropped significantly in the past two years, as 
Bruin Coach Terry Donahue has indicated? 
</P>
<P>
"Not one bit," Smith said. "The first thing I told our players in the scouting 
report (was), we're facing the best collection of speed, on both offense and 
defense, that we've played. 
</P>
<P>
"They're young in spots, just like we are. But you take the speed in the 
secondary, the speed at linebacker, the speed at tailback, the speed at wide 
receiver -- they're not down a bit. In fact, they may be ahead. They're not as 
experienced, maybe, as they've been, but the talent and the speed are there." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in USC's dismantling of Oregon State was the abysmal play of its 
kickoff coverage team, which allowed Dwayne Owens to return six kicks for a 
school-record 237 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And with Notre Dame's Raghib Ismail headed his way on Nov. 24 -- not to mention 
Shawn Wills, who has averaged 25.9 yards a return since replacing Brian Brown, 
UCLA's all-time kickoff return leader -- Smith is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kickoff guy in the country has looked at our films and they're mighty 
brave right now," Smith said. "What we need to do is nail a few of their butts 
back there inside the five- or 10-yard line." 
</P>
<P>
Easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
USC ranks last in the Pacific 10 Conference in kickoff coverage, giving up 25.7 
yards a return. 
</P>
<P>
Owens wasn't the first kick returner to burn the Trojans: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Russell White of California averaged 41 yards on four kickoff returns 
against USC, including a 63-yard return at the start of the game and a 
49-yarder that led to a touchdown in a 31-31 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Qadry (Missile) Ismail of Syracuse, younger brother of Raghib (Rocket) 
Ismail, had a 55-yard kickoff return against USC, the Orangemen's longest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gary Brown of Penn State had a 39-yard return against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Smith of Ohio State had a 35-yard return against the Trojans, the 
Buckeyes' longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Glyn Milburn of Stanford had a 45-yard return against USC, the Cardinal's 
longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Bates of Arizona had a 37-yard fourth-quarter return against the 
Trojans, setting up the Wildcats' fifth touchdown in a 35-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phillipi Sparks of Arizona State had a 47-yard return against USC, the Sun 
Devils' longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that several defensive starters, including free safety Stephon Pace 
and linebackers Scott Ross and Kurt Barber, have volunteered to participate in 
kickoff coverage this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" Smith said. "Because the starters on the defense don't want to come on 
the field and play half-field defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't stand a chance if we're (continually) playing half-field defense. 
We'll have 35 points scored on us if we don't get something done about it."

OLIVER HAUNTED BY HIS FATHER'S DEATH

<P>
Freshman cornerback Jason Oliver said in an interview this week that he 
sometimes cries himself to sleep, wondering if he contributed to the death of 
his father.

Marvin Oliver, highest-ranking black officer in the Kern County Sherriff's 
Dept., died Oct. 18 of respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
Three days earlier, his son and two other USC football players were charged in 
the alleged sexual battery of a 23-year-old female student. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think his health was that bad," Oliver told Lisa Nehus Saxon of the 
Riverside Press-Enterprise. "But now I have to face that maybe because of me, 
maybe that's why my dad died. He wasn't going too bad, and then all of a 
sudden, he died. He died a couple of days after it came out in the paper that I 
had been charged. I never even got to talk to him about it. I called him, and 
he was too sick to talk to me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I read in the (Bakersfield Californian) where my dad was tired and had too 
many worries on him. They said that the fact I had been accused . . . might 
have weighed heavily on him, making him feel bad and be down. They said it may 
have caused him to give up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I just hate to think that I may have been a contributing factor to my own 
father's death . . . but I have to face that."

Oliver's mother, Juanda, died of cancer on Sept. 22. JERRY CROWE

NOW WHAT? Overcrowding of the county's jail system is so critical that "I don't 
know where we can go from here," says Assistant Sheriff Rocky Hewitt. . . . A 
federal court banned additional prisoners in the central jail, forcing inmates 
to other facilities. At the honor farm, inmates sleep in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Many are released without bail, some go free before their sentences are up, and 
700 are furloughed to jobs. . . . What's next? "Eventually we'll have to 
release more serious people," Hewitt says.

GORBACHEV OKS COALITION RULE, YELTSIN ASSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian Federation, said 
Tuesday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed in principle to 
the formation of "a coalition government of national unity," including Yeltsin 
nominees, as a way of sharing power and ending the country's political 
paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he told Gorbachev that Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 
15 constituent republics, would want the right to name the prime minister of 
the central government as well as its defense and finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Recounting his five-hour Sunday meeting with Gorbachev, Yeltsin told members of 
the Russian legislature that he had proposed "a complete new system of state 
power -- the formation of a coalition government of national unity" -- and that 
Gorbachev "in principle supported the line." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing military officers on Tuesday, did not respond directly to 
Yeltsin's proposal but said, "There were no differences with the head of the 
Russian Parliament on the need to create a united but renewed union of 
sovereign states. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider that the conversation was responsible, serious and constructive," 
the Soviet president said, letting stand without demur the Russian leader's 
assertion that they had agreed both on a division of power between the central 
government and the republics and the formation of the proposed coalition 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"And after such a fundamental exchange of opinion on this question, I think I 
have the confidence that we here in the center and the leadership of Russia 
will act in a spirit that corresponds to the interests of our national state 
and all its peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly N. Ignatenko, the president's press secretary, said later that some 
descriptions of the Gorbachev-Yeltsin talks were "a bit sensational," but he 
refused the opportunity to deny that the two leaders had, in fact, reached an 
agreement on a sharing of power and establishment of a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was very acute -- polemical, I would say -- but constructive," 
Ignatenko said. "There were no real differences between the president and 
Yeltsin." 
</P>
<P>
The political and personal rivalry between Gorbachev and Yeltsin has sharpened 
the country's political crisis in recent months. Gorbachev found that Yeltsin's 
proposals commanded popular support where his own reforms drew increasing 
criticism. But Yeltsin discovered that he had little hope of implementing any 
of his ideas without Gorbachev's power. 
</P>
<P>
Each, however, has a sharply different vision of the country's future and a 
strategy on how to get there. That difference plus old quarrels have kept them 
apart as the Soviet economy has continued to disintegrate, ethnic unrest has 
grown and social discontent deepened. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Yeltsin, the agreement would appear to doom the moderate 
government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who has strongly resisted the 
radical economic reforms favored by Yeltsin and who had persuaded Gorbachev 
only last month to pursue narrower reforms at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not claim many posts before consulting with you," Yeltsin told the 
Russian deputies, "but I did express the wish for three -- prime minister, 
finance and defense." 
</P>
<P>
But the next step in cementing the new alliance between the country's most 
powerful leaders was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Gorbachev has defended the increasingly unpopular Ryzhkov, leading 
many Soviet political observers to believe that the president needs the backing 
of the country's vast military-industrial complex not only to pursue his 
reforms but even to remain in office himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, moreover, has no established political or constitutional 
mechanism to implement the agreement outlined by Yeltsin. Nominated by the 
president, the country's prime minister must be elected by the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the national Parliament, and his ministers confirmed by the 
Supreme Soviet, the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, as sketched by Yeltsin and partially confirmed by Gorbachev, 
goes far beyond establishing a coalition government, however, and looks toward 
an entirely new political system in which the republics will have far greater 
authority on their own territory as well as a larger voice in the formulation 
of national policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that a draft of the new treaty reconstituting the Soviet Union 
as a much looser federation will be published in about a week and that this 
will form the basis for further discussions on the division of political and 
economic power in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Without an "active, constructive and responsible" role for Russia, now led by 
Yeltsin and other radical reformers, Gorbachev acknowledged that it would be 
impossible to conclude the new union treaty -- and that this could plunge the 
country into chaos and even civil conflict. Russia is home to half the Soviet 
Union's 290 million people and makes up two-thirds of its territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This union of sovereign states is, to use a military term, the last ditch," he 
told the officers. "Beyond that, the collapse of the state begins. Attempts to 
divide peoples who have lived together for centuries could end in a blood bath. 
And it is necessary to recall that the country's economy is based on a unitary 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"If no account is taken of this, the situation will be worse than during the 
Cultural Revolution in China," Gorbachev warned. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, however, that he had told Gorbachev that all questions of the 
ownership of natural resources, of economic management and fiscal controls, of 
foreign trade and similar issues, would have to be resolved before the union 
treaty is signed. 
</P>
<P>
He and Gorbachev established parallel commissions to examine the issues and 
then draft agreements that will form the basis for amending the proposed union 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the Kremlin meeting, their first extended discussion since a similar 
session in early August, Yeltsin said he had told Gorbachev that the central 
authorities had blocked and delayed the establishment of Russia's sovereignty 
at every point. 
</P>
<P>
"You did not officially recognize our declaration of sovereignty," Yeltsin 
said, recounting his conversation with Gorbachev. "You did not officially 
recognize (the need for) a division of functions between the center and Russia. 
You are still conducting a policy of diktat from the center. And you even 
violate the current constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's bill of complaints extended to foreign policy, including the recent 
signing of treaties with Germany, and to the use of conscripted Russian youths 
in quelling civil unrest outside the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the struggle between Gorbachev and Yeltsin is certain to have 
wide significance for other republics seeking to establish their sovereignty 
and for the survival, in whatever form it takes, of the Soviet Union.

LATINO DISTRICT'S VOTER TURNOUT DROPS TO 26%; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: SOME OBSERVERS SAY LA COLONIA VOTERS MAY HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED BY THE 
LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Voter turnout among residents in La Colonia, Oxnard's predominantly 
Mexican-American neighborhood, was almost 50% lower than the city as a whole, 
despite a recent voter registration drive and two Latino mayoral candidates on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Only 26% of the registered voters in the mostly working-class Latino 
neighborhood went to the polls Nov. 6, while voters throughout the city 
averaged a 48% turnout rate, according to voter records. 
</P>
<P>
Latino advocates and others who have studied voting patterns in Oxnard remained 
undaunted by the percentages, saying Latino voters may have been intimidated by 
the long and complex ballot and the turnout percentages may have been skewed by 
out-of-date voter registration records. 
</P>
<P>
"English is my first language, and I was intimidated by the size of the 
ballot," Assistant Registrar of Voters Ruth P. Shepler said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project funded a voter 
registration drive that concentrated on Latino voters in La Colonia and Rose 
Park neighborhoods. About 300 new voters were registered during the drive, said 
Noelia Chavez, a spokeswoman for El Concilio of Ventura County, a Latino 
advocacy group in Oxnard that coordinated the drive. 
</P>
<P>
During the effort, Chavez said El Concilio found that many Mexican-American 
voters in Oxnard were intimidated by the size of the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
El Concilio also found that many of the addresses for voters in La Colonia were 
out of date, she said. In addition, the organization learned that many 
residents were not citizens and therefore could not register to vote, Chavez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
El Concilio gathered the names of about 225 residents who were interested in 
becoming naturalized citizens, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 general elections -- which coincided with the presidential 
election -- 43% of the voters in La Colonia turned out to vote, while the rest 
of the city averaged 67%, according to voting records. 
</P>
<P>
Shepler said turnout percentages are usually 20% to 30% higher during a 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The county provided no Spanish-language ballots during either election. 
</P>
<P>
Activism among the city's Latinos, who represent more than 50% of Oxnard's 
population, has been on the rise in recent years and the low turnout should not 
be counted as a setback, said Karl Lawson, a community relations specialist for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the turnout percentages reported by county voting 
officials are skewed because La Colonia residents move more frequently than 
other residents and may not re-register, leaving voting records out of date. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not just talking about a handful of people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who worked for the United Farm Workers union for 11 years before he was 
hired by the city, agrees that the complexity and size of this year's ballot 
may also have discouraged some Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
"That intimidated college graduates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Soria, one of two Mexican-American candidates who unsuccessfully ran for 
the mayoral post, said he believes that Latino voters simply were frustrated 
with an electoral system that has produced only three Latino council members in 
the city's 87-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't like to lose," he said. "They like to win." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Soria filed a lawsuit that seeks to replace the city's at-large 
voting system with a system that allows districts to elect representatives to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
That system would encourage Latinos to vote because it would force politicians 
to focus on neighborhood problems, he said. Politicians "would have to entice 
and involve every single district in Oxnard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Soria and the city are trying to resolve the lawsuit out of court. 
However, Soria said he believes that the suit will be decided by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be satisfied until we get a real opportunity at democracy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
While there were two Mexican-American candidates running for mayor Nov. 6, 
voters in La Colonia overwhelmingly voted for incumbent and winner Nao 
Takasugi, who is of Asian descent but was raised in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In the council race, La Colonia voters helped reelect three-term incumbent 
Manuel Lopez, an optometrist who was born and raised in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said the results prove that Latino voters don't necessarily vote for 
Latino candidates.

NEW LEADER TAKES OVER TEST CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
POINT MUGU: THE OUTGOING BASE COMMANDER CALLS IT THE BEST NAVY JOB HE EVER HAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Standing at attention in dress blues Tuesday, Naval officers and enlisted men 
at Point Mugu said goodby to their top jet jockey and welcomed the former 
leader of the Blue Angels precision flying squadron to command the Pacific 
Missile Test Center. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony punctuated by multiple-gun salutes, Rear Adm. George H. Strohsahl 
turned over command of the base to Rear Adm. William E. Newman, giving up what 
is arguably the best job inthe Navy for a ranking officer who loves to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last two years, I've tried to make time stand still," Strohsahl said 
in his farewell speech. "The harder I tried the harder it got. And here I am 
about to give up the best job I've ever had in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Strohsahl, known for his boyish enthusiasm about flying, is headed for what 
test pilots disparagingly call a "desk job" in Washington. The promotion will 
put him second in command of the Naval Air Systems Command, in charge of 
acquiring and testing all of the Navy's air- and ground-fired missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, Blue Angels flight leader in 1978-79, could hardly restrain his delight 
in landing the Navy's top job in Ventura County -- which just happens to 
include as much flying as he can squeeze into his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just jet jockeys, you know," said Newman, standing next to Strohsahl 
at the Officers Club on base. Indeed, Newman is assuming command of the nearly 
5,000 military personnel and civilians who test the Navy's most sophisticated 
jet fighters, high-tech missiles, electronic warfare and other weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to get up in the air to keep tabs on what is going on," Newman 
said. "Besides, it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
In his address to base officials, Newman, 50, said he was "glad to be here" 
five years after he underwent open-heart surgery. "The Navy is a great 
organization, it allows you to bounce back from a fall." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he was pleased to move to "one of the most beautiful places 
in the nation" and that he hopes to retire here in his "life after the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
As for his new command, Newman said he intends to carry on the Pacific Missile 
Test Center's role of providing weapons that work to U.S. naval forces in the 
Middle East and around the globe. He suggested that the United States' superior 
technology and sophisticated weaponry -- much of which is tested at Point Mugu 
-- must be weighing heavily on the mind of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
During the lengthy ceremony, eight enlisted men collapsed from dehydration, or 
from locking their knees while standing at attention. All of them were taken by 
ambulance to a medical clinic on base, treated and released in good condition, 
said Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto, Point Mugu's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is common when you are standing at attention for a long period of time," 
Okamoto said. "If you don't make sure your knees are unlocked, you will buckle 
and fall," he said. Locked knees can restrict blood circulation and cause 
fainting. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 Navy enlisted men and Marines stood for more than two hours under 
sparkling afternoon sunshine. "A couple of them didn't have lunch," Okamoto 
said. "That may have contributed to it too."

VANDERKOLK PICKS ENVIRONMENTALIST AS AIDE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE SUPERVISOR-ELECT SAYS RUSS BAGGERLY SHARES 'THE SAME VALUES THAT 
I HAVE.' BUT HER PREDECESSOR CRITICIZES THE APPOINTMENT.

<P>
In her first major act as a Ventura County supervisor-elect, Maria VanderKolk 
on Tuesday appointed the county's top environmental crusader as her senior 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly, a frequent critic and legal opponent of the county on issues of 
growth and pollution, will become VanderKolk's top lieutenant with an office at 
the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly, 46, will earn $40,000 to $45,000 a year plus benefits, VanderKolk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At VanderKolk's request, he resigned from the board of the Environmental 
Coalition and dissolved the business he formed to act as a paid consultant to 
Patagonia Inc. in a battle to prevent Cal State University from building a 
campus at Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly resigned earlier this year from the board of Citizens to Preserve the 
Ojai, which successfully sued the county in 1988 over the county's failure to 
submit a plan that would meet federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
While most observers were optimistic that Baggerly would deal fairly with those 
he has opposed in the past, outgoing Supervisor Madge Schaefer criticized 
Baggerly because he has never lived in the district he will be serving. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk said Baggerly's positions are well-researched and based on law, 
primarily the California Environmental Quality Act, and should ease his 
transition from environmental volunteer to senior staff member. 
</P>
<P>
"Russ prepares his arguments extensively, and he is very well respected at the 
county," VanderKolk said. "I hope this appointment makes it clear that I intend 
to surround myself with people who share the same values that I have." 
</P>
<P>
Although Baggerly is already knowledgeable about environmental and land-use 
issues, VanderKolk said she is convinced of his abilities in other areas as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a gentle, kind and thoughtful person who will be very helpful working 
with the constituency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly, who has no college degree, said he has the skills he needs to serve 
as administrative assistant, answering constituents' complaints, dealing with 
cities, state and federal agencies and the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how government works. I know the law and the General Plan. I know the 
administrative process and can help her get things done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk will become the youngest member of the county board when she is 
sworn in Jan. 7 as supervisor of District 2, covering much of the Oxnard Plain 
and the Conejo Valley. She defeated Schaefer in June in one of the county's 
most stunning electoral upsets. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old businesswoman who is a newcomer to the county and its politics, 
VanderKolk captured 50.2% of the vote to win the seat that most believed would 
be returned to the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
She will maintain her primary supervisorial office for the east county district 
in Thousand Oaks, with two administrative assistants and a secretary working 
there. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk also announced Tuesday the appointment of Lenora Kirby, a 15-year 
county resident who is earning a degree in geography from Cal State Northridge. 
Kirby worked with VanderKolk for Save Open Space, an environmental group formed 
in opposition to the proposed development on the Ahmanson Ranch in the eastern 
county. 
</P>
<P>
A third aide with experience in financial and health issues and a secretary 
will be appointed later, VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Baggerly brought mostly positive reaction Tuesday from 
agriculture, building and government interests, all of which Baggerly has 
battled on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, has criticized 
Baggerly in the past for his opposition to a landfill at Weldon Canyon -- land 
that is not in agriculture production -- in favor of other land in production 
now. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I think Russ is a capable individual and he will be directed 
by the policies that Maria sets." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tryon, executive officer at the 2,500-member Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California, acknowledged that Baggerly has been an adversary to 
building interests. 
</P>
<P>
"But we will hope for the opportunity to have our issues evaluated fairly 
without bias by that office," Tryon said. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly said he wants that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to develop a relationship with the building industry," he said. 
"You get things done by building bridges, not by burning them." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baldwin, manager of the county's Air Pollution Control District, said 
Baggerly has helped the district formulate rules to control industry. But when 
Baggerly and the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai sued the county and the air 
pollution district over its 1988 Air Quality Management Plan, Baggerly hurt the 
clean air cause more than he helped it, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"That actually slowed us down," he said of the district's work to adopt 
regulations to reduce air polluting emissions from industry. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly, a 17-year resident of the west county, has been active in 
environmental causes since a 1985 battle to stop a housing project in his home 
community of Meiners Oaks. His wife, Pat, has been equally as active and will 
not give up that role, Baggerly said. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't give up her citizenship just because I'm working for a county 
supervisor," he said. "The First Amendment still applies." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who has also been a Baggerly critic, questioned his ability to serve 
a constituency that lives at the opposite end of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is regrettable that she is choosing someone with no knowledge of 
the district," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
But VanderKolk and Baggerly defended his familiarity with the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Russ has been a key player in the Jordan and Ahmanson ranch projects," 
VanderKolk said, referring to controversial development proposals for the east 
county that will soon go before the Board of Supervisors for a vote. "He has 
certainly concentrated more in the Ojai area, but he has branched out in the 
last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said Tuesday that VanderKolk 
had made a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the environment and lifestyle that people want in Ventura County is a 
major issue," he said.

NEWPORT BLVD. WILL SHRINK TO 2 LANES UNTIL JUNE; 
</P>

TRAFFIC: FREEWAY WORK HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE CRUNCH. SOME NEARBY BUSINESSES ARE 
THINKING OF WAYS TO COPE.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a year, motorists have lamented the terrible traffic jams 
plaguing Newport Boulevard since construction crews began the tedious chore of 
lengthening the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Think it's bad now? Wait until tonight. 
</P>
<P>
At about 10 p.m., the three northbound lanes of Newport Boulevard will be 
closed down completely, and just one lane will be reopened Thursday morning in 
time for the first flush of commuters. Here's the really bad news: It will stay 
that way until at least next June, according to California Transportation 
Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
The road closure, which stretches between 19th and 22nd streets, comes at the 
same time southbound Newport Boulevard is also reduced to a solitary and very 
crowded single lane along the same stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Officials originally wanted to stagger the closures so only one side of the 
road would be affected at a time, but they altered those plans because of 
construction problems that have cropped up in the 2-mile extension of the Costa 
Mesa Freeway. The mammoth trench that will accommodate the new highway runs 
down the middle of Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But there is some good news in all of this. If everything goes according to 
plan, all six lanes of Newport Boulevard should be open in time for the 
onslaught of summer beach traffic. Under original plans, the thoroughfare's 
northbound lanes would have been reduced over the summer, threatening to put a 
crimp in the travel plans of even the most devout beach-goer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going as fast as we can at it," said Jim Murray, Caltrans' assistant 
resident engineer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Such news does little to console merchants along Newport Boulevard, who have 
suffered through long months of gridlock on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Though signs tell motorists that the various stores are open during 
construction, it's certainly not business as usual -- particularly in areas 
where construction has reduced the road to one lane. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta and Michael Katbi, owners of White Glove Cleaners on southbound Newport 
Boulevard, say business this fall is half what it was last year at the same 
time. Dover Shores Pet Care Center, a veterinary hospital and grooming facility 
in the same shopping center, has seen business drop off about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule at the pet care center has been turned upside down because 
customers don't realize how long it will take to get there, veterinarian Bruce 
Bauersfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
And a detour of cars to nearby Harbor Boulevard intended to allay some of the 
traffic has not helped matters, Bauersfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"You want people to come to your business, and when they put an official detour 
to take people away from you, it doesn't make you feel too good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On northbound Newport Boulevard, business owners say the construction has 
already affected them. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to drive their car down the street. It's all dirty with dust 
flying everywhere," said Carrie Thurston, manager of a Subway sandwich store 
north of 20th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Subway will soon start delivering sandwiches in an effort to increase business, 
which has already dropped by 50%, Thurston said. "If they won't come to us, 
we'll go to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such measures are not unique. White Glove Cleaners has started picking up and 
delivering dry cleaning, and Newport Rib Co. has put more emphasis on its 
catering business. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have been trying their best to keep troubles to a minimum, 
but it has proven a tough task. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities discovered that a sewage line crossing the Costa Mesa Freeway 
extension could not simply be ripped out and replaced with something running 
under the freeway. Instead, Caltrans officials have determined that they need 
to build a separate concrete bridge across the freeway for a new sewage line 
and a special pump station on one bank. 
</P>
<P>
All that work required room on both banks of the freeway trench, hence the lane 
closure on each side. In addition, Caltrans will dig back the banks on either 
side of the trench and erect towering concrete retaining walls, a task that can 
only be performed with most of the lanes shut down.

GAMBLING CLUB ALLOWED TO REOPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fillmore City Council on Tuesday approved a permit for a card gambling club 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-0 vote, the city gave the go-ahead to Bud and Betty Burton to reopen the 
Pan Pad Club for poker and pan games on the site of the old Perkos Restaurant 
on Ventura Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Burtons bought the restaurant earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pan Pad Club had operated between 1971 and 1986, when the city brought the 
club's building on Fillmore Street and transformed it into a senior citizen 
center. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for agreeing to sell the building, Burton was allowed to renew his 
gambling license, Councilman Roger Campbell said. Gambling was outlawed in 
Fillmore soon after the Pan Pad Club was licensed, but the Burtons were allowed 
to keep their license because they had opened the club before the ban went into 
effect, Campbell said. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

OUTGOING MAYOR DECRIES CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Decrying the divisiveness that has split the City Council, outgoing Mayor 
Christian W. Keena warned Tuesday that continuing "political conflict will 
produce little good for the city." 
</P>
<P>
"We have learned that the failure to compromise has a great cost," Keena said 
in a prepared farewell State of the City report. "I shudder to read of 
political battles brewing in our city and those in neighboring cities. . . . 
Conflict distracts leaders from their collective objectives and depletes the 
city of its spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict on the council peaked earlier this year when some council members 
supported a recall effort against Councilman Robert A. Curtis. The failed 
effort was heavily financed by the Mission Viejo Co. and other developers. 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers here attributed Keena's decision not to seek 
reelection to the fact that he would have been targeted for defeat by Curtis' 
allies. Keena, however, has insisted that after seven years in Mission Viejo 
politics, he wanted to devote more attention to his law practice "and volunteer 
for a good community cause." 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the bickering on the council, Keena said: "As I see it, the root of 
the problem has been a fundamental disagreement on the level of politics that 
is appropriate for Mission Viejo. . . . We have learned that the failure to 
compromise has a great cost; that before we disrupt city business to win on a 
point we should always consider the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Keena declared that "Mission Viejo's financial affairs are in order." The city 
has an estimated $2-million surplus in the current fiscal year and more than 
$20 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Keena cited the acquisition of a building to serve as City Hall as a "historic 
milestone." The purchase will save the city $400,000 annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is scheduled to occupy the new offices by next April. But the 
issue of the new City Hall became a campaign issue, and Curtis has said that he 
and other council members are likely to reverse the decision to occupy the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Keena also said the city had worked to make Mission Viejo safer for residents. 
During the last year, residential burglaries have decreased by 11%, commercial 
burglaries by 17% and traffic accidents by 1%, while drunk-driving arrests have 
increased by 24%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keena called on South County cities to set up a regional detention center to 
improve police services in the area. "Every time a deputy makes an arrest the 
suspect has to be transported to the County Jail in Santa Ana," he said. "The 
time it takes to transport and book suspects reduces the number of hours 
deputies are on patrol." 
</P>
<P>
The outgoing mayor warned cities to resist attempts by state and county 
government to pass on "to cities the costs of traditionally non-city services." 
</P>
<P>
Keena called on the new council to "lead Mission Viejo from a past of promises 
to a bright new future full of promise."DAVAN MAHARAJ

HIGH SCHOOL POOL IS GIVEN TOP PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cracked Ventura High School swimming pool, drained last spring after it 
began leaking, has become a danger to neighborhood children who try to climb 
the fence surrounding the pool and skateboard on the dry concrete, school 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District board on Tuesday designated construction of 
a pool an emergency, speeding up the process of tearing out the old pool and 
building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted to use developer fees to help pay for the new pool, 
estimated to cost up to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
An engineering study found that the ground under the 37-year-old pool is 
shifting and the pool is slowly sinking. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of a new pool depends on the amount of work needed to stabilize the 
ground and shore up the new pool, Assistant Supt. Richard Welcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Developer fees will be used to pay $500,000 of the pool's cost. 
</P>
<P>
Also, additional costs will be paid from a fund accumulated from certificates 
sold to investors on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
District officials hope to have the new pool finished by the 1991-92 school 
year. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

WHEN POLICE VAN TALKS, KIDS LISTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Buster" used to roam the streets of Brea transporting drugs and dealers. But 
since police seized the 1989 Mitsubishi van in a drug bust last year, Buster 
has turned over a new floor mat. 
</P>
<P>
These days the van, nicknamed Buster by the Brea Police Department's DARE team, 
makes the rounds of elementary schools in Brea delivering an anti-drug message. 
Equipped with a computer and an electronic voice, the talking van acts as the 
fifth officer on the DARE team, and is far and away the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Brian Parker, one of the DARE team officers assigned to Brea's 
elementary schools, drove Buster to Mariposa Elementary School recently to talk 
to 70 first-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The students knew Parker from previous DARE lessons, but had never met Buster. 
As they gathered on the school's field, Parker explained to them that the 
talking van had drifted off to sleep waiting for the students to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if we can wake up Buster," Parker said to the students. 
</P>
<P>
He selected a volunteer to pound on the front of the van while he rocked it 
from side to side. To the delight of the students, Buster's lights came on, his 
windshield wipers started up and the van began to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi kids!" the electronic voice said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi Buster!" they roared back. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 10 minutes, the black and white van held the audience's attention 
with a message about safety, the role of police officers and the danger of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
There were several opportunities for the students to answer Buster's questions, 
and each time 70 voices yelled a response. First-grade teacher Phyllis Chiles 
attributed that enthusiasm to the novelty of a talking van and to the 
children's exposure to animation and special effects on television and in the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more impressed with the van than a person," Chiles said. "They are 
really listening." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the first-graders, Buster's message was the first time they heard 
about drugs from a law enforcement representative. Parker does not discuss 
drugs with students until they reach the second grade. 
</P>
<P>
Students in other grade levels will also see Buster, but Parker said the impact 
is greatest on those in second grade and younger. 
</P>
<P>
"Third-grade students are more interested in how the van works, what makes it 
talk," Parker said. "This age is fascinated by the fact that it is talking to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Next year Buster will have a separate message for students in second grade. The 
van will tell the story of its illicit past and how the Police Department 
"saved" it from a horrible life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to let the van tell its story," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parker thinks the students are equally receptive to messages from him 
or the van, he said it was more exciting for them to hear a mechanical voice. 
</P>
<P>
Buster is also a way for Parker to reach more students. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there is a child who has had a bad experience with a police officer. 
Perhaps his parents were involved in an incident where the police were called. 
A mechanical police officer might have a different impact on them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Parker, Buster is the only talking van in the state. Other cities 
do have police cars equipped with electronic voices, but none are used as a 
regular part of the DARE lessons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker and two other DARE officers visit elementary schools in Brea and Yorba 
Linda, which is served by the Brea Police Department. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

PANEL TO DISCUSS STADIUM LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of homeowners that has been seeking for a year to get the stadium 
lights lowered at Ventura High School asked Ventura Unified School District 
board members Tuesday to form a committee to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Despite staff recommendations that the current lights are the best option for 
stadium security and illuminating track and field events, board members agreed 
to meet with members of the Hillside Homeowners group to discuss their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Board members John Walker and Vincent Ruiz volunteered to serve on the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the neighborhood surrounding Ventura High's Larrabee Stadium in 
the 2200 block of Poli Street have charged that four new stadium lights are too 
tall, block ocean views, reflect sunshine during the day and shine into their 
homes during nighttime events. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-member group suggested forming a committee of two board members and two 
homeowners who would visit Nordhoff High School in Ojai to look at that 
school's stadium lights, which are about 70 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the homeowners group have said lowering the lights would cost about 
$20,000, and they have offered to help raise funds to pay for the modification.

BUILDERS OVERSEE SHELTER RENOVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of HomeAid, a program sponsored by the Building Industry Assn. to 
assist the homeless, visited the Friendship Shelter on Tuesday to oversee 
$100,000 in renovations that the program is sponsoring at the homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The renovations include a new staircase, a new balcony, an enlarged kitchen, 
new carpeting and repair of five bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, a former apartment house, accommodates up to 20 people, but the 
replacement of the balcony will permit five more people to live upstairs 
because it will provide an additional fire escape. 
</P>
<P>
The work at Friendship Shelter began several months ago and is the first of 
four shelters to be renovated under HomeAid's second phase of projects. The 
group's first phase involved the construction and renovation of five shelters, 
which increased the number of beds for county homeless by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, said Bob Albertson, HomeAid chairman, is to support programs that 
provide homeless people with temporary shelter until they find work, save money 
and can live independently. 
</P>
<P>
The labor and supplies for the renovation of Friendship Shelter were donated by 
HomeAid members and augmented by donations from the community. Shea Homes and 
Brock Homes are the "builder captains" on the project, responsible for lining 
up sub-contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like manna from heaven," the Rev. Colin Henderson, executive director 
of the shelter, told visiting HomeAid officials. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter houses homeless people for up to 60 days, during which time 
residents must look for work and save money so that they can afford housing on 
their own when they leave. The shelter provides two meals a day, as well as job 
and psychiatric counseling. Henderson said that in the shelter's two-year 
history, 124 people have gone on to independent living. MARCIDA DODSON

COUNCIL TO APPEAL RULING IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday laid the groundwork for an appeal of last week's 
decision by a federal jury to award $300,000 to a man shot in the back by a 
Newport Beach police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted in closed session to file motions for a new trial and for the 
judge to invalidate the jury's verdict and issue a new ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Both motions are required before an appeal can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
The award to Ricky Patrick Miller, 28, was the second time in six months that 
the city has faced paying a substantial sum to a person shot by one of its 
police officers. In June, the city agreed to pay a $1.5-million out-of-court 
settlement to a man who was critically shot and wounded by a police officer who 
mistook the victim's portable radio for a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these cases, council members remain supportive of the Police 
Department. Councilman Clarence J. Turner said he considers the cases to be 
isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think we do a pretty good job," Turner said, adding that he feels 
the department's internal investigation system guards against the use of 
excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John C. Cox Jr. agreed, saying that the department's internal 
standards have become more strict. "It's 10 times more thorough than it was 10 
years ago," Cox said. "Any time you have an incident like this, it raises a lot 
of issues. . . . The D.A. always gets involved and then if it goes to court, 
which seems to be popular these days, then it gets another review in court." 
</P>
<P>
Cox also said that out-of-court settlements of police cases can be misconstrued 
by the public. "Settlement doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does save 
taxpayers a lot of money" because of legal expenses, he said. LAURA MICHAELIS

HEARING POSTPONED IN ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pretrial hearing for the youth accused of throwing a piece of glass that 
disfigured 15-year-old Amber Jefferson was postponed Tuesday -- his 18th 
birthday -- because he reportedly was too ill to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt David Wimberly was scheduled to appear in West Orange County Municipal 
Court in Westminster on assault and weapons charges in connection with an Aug. 
7 brawl outside his Stanton home. 
</P>
<P>
However, with relatives from both sides present in the courtroom, Wimberly's 
attorney Salvatore Ciulla told Municipal Judge Frank Fasel that his client had 
suffered an unknown medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also said they did not know the nature or the seriousness of 
Wimberly's illness. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it was something with his nose, but they're not giving us much 
information," Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper said. "All I know is the jail 
personnel decided that it was serious enough not to transport him." 
</P>
<P>
The case has been rescheduled for Nov. 26. Wimberly is charged with felony 
mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, infliction of great bodily injury and 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was one of three people charged in connection with a near-fatal 
attack that left Jefferson, a Garden Grove cheerleader, with a disfiguring scar 
from her temple to the side of her neck.TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

2 SLIGHTLY INJURED IN BALBOA BAY CLUB FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people suffered minor injuries Tuesday night during a fire that caused 
extensive damage to an apartment at the exclusive Balboa Bay Club, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A 32-year-old maintenance worker, identified as Leo Pilapil, was taken to Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach for treatment of minor smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Schuler, 76, who lives in the apartment complex at 1221 W. Coast 
Highway, suffered a cut to his right hand and was treated at the scene by 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 firefighters battled the blaze, which started shortly before 6:30 
p.m. in the kitchen area of Unit 130, Newport Beach Fire Capt. Randy Scheerer 
said. The fire was contained in about 10 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The resident of the unit, Herlane Levin, was not inside the apartment when the 
fire broke out, Scheerer said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the second-alarm fire was under investigation, said Scheerer, who 
added that a damage estimate had not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 units of the complex were evacuated for several hours as firefighters 
mopped up the area and the smoke dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
During the blaze, firefighter Terry Lewis rescued a small white cat named Baby, 
which belongs to Schuler's 77-year-old wife, Eileen. 
</P>
<P>
"He saved my Baby, I can't believe it," Eileen Schuler said. "I was scared to 
death that Baby was in there. It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
John Schuler said his wife tried to go back into the apartment after she 
realized that her cat was still in the unit, which was directly above the 
apartment that was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"She couldn't get back in because there was too much smoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Lewis saved the cat and handed her back to Eileen Schuler, the relieved 
owner kissed the firefighter. MATT LAIT

<P>
CITY OUTLAWS FEES FOR PRIVATE PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a crackdown on teen-age parties that attract gangs, the city has outlawed 
admission charges for private parties. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance passed this week is specifically aimed at the parties advertised 
through flyers and by word of mouth at Los Alamitos High School and neighboring 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that gangs have a tendency to barge into parties like that, cruise 
around and look for parties of that nature," Police Chief James Guess said. "It 
leads to some pretty volatile situations." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a 17-year-old party host was stabbed to death on Sept. 22 
on San Mateo Avenue in a gang attack. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just such a party, one that charged and which had been advertised at 
the high school through flyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without admission fees, Guess said, "we're hoping that they'll realize they 
can't afford to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Dorrans, assistant principal in charge of student discipline at Los 
Alamitos High School, said he forwards any party flyers he comes across to the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to cooperate fully with the police," Dorrans said. "I get a number of 
them over the school year and always call the police jurisdiction involved." 
</P>
<P>
Dorrans said the need for the ordinance has increased in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol tends to be the drug of choice here, and most of our serious problems 
stem from it," Dorrans said. "We've had students injured in several traffic 
accidents involving drinking and driving. We have felt somewhat insulated in 
the past, but no longer." 
</P>
<P>
Courtesies, such as gifts from guests and sharing of meal expenses, are not 
considered admission, city officials said. Parties in which donations are 
accepted for political, charitable or religious causes also are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Violators of the ordinance could be fined up to $500 and sentenced to up to six 
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos modeled its ordinance after one in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Guess said the police chiefs in the neighboring cities of Cypress and Seal 
Beach expressed a strong interest in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Such parties are time-consuming and costly to police departments," Cypress 
Police Chief Daryl Wicker said. "You don't just send one unit out to disburse 
300 or 400 kids who have been drinking." 
</P>
<P>
The new law has the added deterrent of allowing the Police Department to 
recover law enforcement costs in some instances under the "second response" 
policy, according to Guess. 
</P>
<P>
If the Police Department receives advance notice that someone plans to charge 
admission to a party -- for instance, by receiving one of the flyers circulated 
at schools -- the department will notify the host that to do so would be 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
If the party goes on as planned and the police are called, the host will be 
held liable for the cost of the police response, Guess said. KATHIE BOZANICH

HEARING TO ADDRESS SAN JOAQUIN TOLLWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A public hearing tonight will focus on the environmental failings and merits of 
the proposed San Joaquin Hills tollway, which would cut through some of Orange 
County's most ecologically sensitive terrain but also promises to help ease the 
region's pressing traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
Several groups opposed to the project say they will attend the hearing and some 
promise to picket the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The $667-million tollway has drawn fire from environmentalists and homeowners 
near the route, which branches off Interstate 5 at the southern end of Mission 
Viejo and meanders northwest to end at the Corona del Mar Freeway in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Orange County agency devoted to building the tollway say 
they are working hard to address any concerns and remain resolute that the 
highway will be built. 
</P>
<P>
Wetlands that are paved over by the road will be re-created elsewhere, they 
say. The highway will also be built to accommodate the migratory paths of deer 
and other animals by creating passageways beneath the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tollway will be carved through the canyons so a minimal amount 
of earth has to be removed from hillsides, creating a road that will be 
picturesque, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been straightforward with our intentions," said William C. Woollett 
Jr., executive director of the tollways agency. "We have modified (the tollway) 
and are still willing to modify it, but we're going to build it." 
</P>
<P>
However, residents of communities from Laguna Beach to Leisure World are 
concerned about the highway's potential effect on everything from pollution to 
property values. Others complain that the tollway would only help spark a 
development boom in an area already choked with houses. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are concerned that the highway would trample one of the last 
remaining vestiges of Orange County's bucolic past, pushing a ribbon of asphalt 
through land that ultimately is expected to become a wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see this thing built," said Michael Phillips, executive 
director of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., a group opposed to the tollway. "We're going 
to try very hard to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. at Laguna Hills High School, 25401 Paseo de 
Valencia. ERIC BAILEY

SEAL BEACH ORDERS INITIATIVE TO RIVAL ONE BACKED BY MOLA

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night ordered a committee to draw up a ballot 
measure to rival one sponsored by Mola Development Corp., which for years has 
been trying to build a $200-million housing development on the old Hellman 
Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
The rival measure was supported by council members Gwen Forsythe, Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings and Frank Laszlo, the three who voted down Mola's most recent proposal 
in June for building 329 homes on the 149-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the people have a choice," Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Mola-backed measure are gathering signatures on behalf of a 
proposal that would let voters decide whether the project as proposed by the 
developer should be built. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joe Hunt and Mayor Edna Wilson criticized the rival measure. "I 
believe that another initiative would just cloud the issue," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hellman Specific Plan Committee, made up of 15 residents, has until Dec. 1 
to come up with an alternative to Mola's measure.

MIKE PENNER: SYMBOLIC GESTURES FALL SHORT

 I ain't gonna play Sun City . . . or Phoenix . . . or Tempe . . . or Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Football United Against Arizona, 1990 
</P>
<P>
America in the 1990s is a country infatuated with symbols, where the burning of 
a flag can inflame the public fervor but the plight of the homeless can't; 
where Just Say No buttons are considered the solution to the drug problem; 
where one glib catch-phrase about reading lips can decide a presidential 
election; and where Arizona can be branded the new Pretoria because its voters 
rejected a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
That's the thing about symbols: They're simple. They're not messy. They make us 
feel better about ourselves because they enable us to take a stand without 
getting sweaty or dirty or personally involved. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the NFL decides to fight racism by threatening to pull the 1993 
Super Bowl out of Phoenix -- and not addressing the issue of why the league has 
but one black head coach and no black general managers. 
</P>
<P>
This is why college football jumps on the same bandwagon by threatening to move 
the Fiesta Bowl from Tempe and castigating teams for accepting bids to Tucson's 
Copper Bowl -- but shrugs its shoulders at a system that exploits black 
athletes for millions of entertainment dollars, only to shove them out four 
years later without degrees or, worse, as functional illiterates. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is an embarrassment that Arizona voted against a Martin Luther 
King holiday. It is also an embarrassment that two other states, Montana and 
New Hampshire, fail to observe the same holiday. 
</P>
<P>
But why make it an issue now? Arizona has been without a Martin Luther King 
holiday since 1987. Why was there no outcry when the NFL first awarded the 
Super Bowl to Phoenix? Why was there no protest when Bill Bidwill decided to 
move his Cardinals from St. Louis to Phoenix? Why were there no condemnations 
when Notre Dame and West Virginia chose the Fiesta Bowl for their national 
championship showdown? 
</P>
<P>
And if Arizona is to be blacklisted as a racist state, what is big-time sports 
going to do about the rest of the country? 
</P>
<P>
What about San Diego, where voters refused to rename Market Street as Martin 
Luther King Jr. Way, where the board of port commissioners refused to name the 
new convention center after King? 
</P>
<P>
What about New Orleans, where the 1990 Super Bowl was staged despite the fact 
that David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan member, was holding a public office in 
the state of Louisiana? 
</P>
<P>
What about Miami, where the 1989 Super Bowl was staged while race riots raged 
in the streets? 
</P>
<P>
What about Charlotte, home to the NBA Hornets and the type of sentiment that 
can reelect Sen. Jesse Helms, the old segregationist who based his recent 
campaign on an anti-affirmative action platform? 
</P>
<P>
What about Birmingham, where some of this nation's bloodiest racial skirmishes 
were fought and where the All-American Bowl is still played? 
</P>
<P>
What about Washington, D.C., where the NFL team that plays in the nation's 
capital is known as the Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
What about Cleveland, which has a baseball team known as the Indians? 
</P>
<P>
What about Boston, home to the whitest baseball team in the land? Here is where 
the best black player in the history of the franchise, Jim Rice, retires and 
the Red Sox honor him by having Rice share his "day" with Bob Stanley, who was 
nothing more than an average white relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the frightening kind of Al Campanis thought that still permeates 
much of major-league baseball? In the dugouts and the press boxes of the 
American League, you hear it whispered that the reason the Toronto Blue Jays 
don't win is because they have "too many Dominicans" -- replete with all the 
hoary stereotypes: They're too hot-headed, they don't play together, they fold 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, these whispers are acknowledged only by a nod. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with big-time sports entering the political arena on one issue is 
that it leaves itself open to hypocrisy on so many others. Racism in sports, as 
in society, begins at home -- and neither the NFL nor the NCAA has its own 
house entirely in order. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, racism figured in the defeat of the Arizona King Day. But the outcome 
is clouded by a variety of outside factors, including the NFL itself. 
</P>
<P>
A week before the election, it was leaked -- or planted? -- that the NFL would 
consider pulling the Super Bowl if Arizona rejected the King measure. 
Previously, several polls had indicated that voters would pass the initiative 
by a 10- to 15-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
But many perceived the leak-plant as blackmail, dug in their heels, and voted 
no simply over principle. The NFL made itself an issue when the only one that 
should have mattered was the proper honoring of a great civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
After the fact, it is too easy to grandstand; it is difficult to look bad by 
taking the anti-Arizona stand on this one. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL and the NCAA can do much better, much more. How about some affirmative 
action inside NFL front offices and within NFL coaching staffs? What about 
taking NCAA television money and using it to increase educational opportunities 
for minorities? 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Fiesta Bowl stands to do more real good by staying and playing 
than symbolically pulling out. The bowl is planning to pay each team an 
additional $100,000, to be earmarked for minority scholarship programs. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't as dramatic as moving the bowl to another state. 
</P>
<P>
Only more constructive.

PREP FOOTBALL: COUNTY'S THREE YOUNG GUNS CHALLENGE UNBEATEN GLENDALE IN 
SECTION'S STRONGEST BRACKET.

<P>
When sizing up the Southern Section Division II football playoffs, it's easy to 
envision a movie marquee reading: Young Guns III vs. The Predator. 
</P>
<P>
The guns are quarterbacks Rob Johnson (El Toro), Tony Solliday (Capistrano 
Valley) and Tim Snowden (Mission Viejo) of the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson passed for 2,207 yards and Solliday had 1,961, but Snowden led Mission 
Viejo to victories over both teams and the league title. 
</P>
<P>
The predator is running back Pathon Rucker of Glendale (10-0). The junior is 
the state's top scorer with 192 points and has gained 1,760 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For added suspense, there's the presence of two-time defending Division III 
champion Paramount, which was been moved up. Paramount has won 18 consecutive 
games and is 35-2 in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
All of this adds up to the strongest of the section's 10 divisions, with eight 
teams capable of winning the title. And the winner will be . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Paramount," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. "They've got a big-time running 
attack, speedy receivers, and they're the returning champs. But then, they 
could get beat by Muir in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Muir last week, and they're for real. You have to respect Muir, because 
at any time they can explode. They could win it all or lose in the first 
round." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Coach Ken Sutch said more than eight teams are capable of winning the 
division but likes his team's chances whenever it plays at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't lost a home game in four years," he said. "I'm sure the natural 
thing will be for everyone to shoot at us. But that's a nice position to be 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Tony Neal and Demondre Smith are the backbone of a Paramount's 
offense. Neal has rushed for 1,138 yards and scored 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think of us as a run-oriented team, but our quarterback (Steve 
Lopez) has thrown for 18 touchdowns," Sutch said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Shoemaker, who led Glendale to its first playoff appearance since 
1985, said the past playoff success of South Coast schools commands respect in 
the revamped division. 
</P>
<P>
"Those schools should have gone into Division I," Shoemaker said. "They can 
play with anybody, including Fontana and Eisenhower. I think any of those three 
schools have the offense and defense to win the division." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has been somewhat overlooked despite being seeded fourth. Rucker 
rushed for 200 or more yards in four games and reached 100 against every 
opponent except Muir. Glendale's defense has allowed only 81 points. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to point to Muir in our league, even though we beat them (23-8)," 
Shoemaker said. "They have more college athletes than any team in the CIF 
(Southern Section). But if they have a weakness, it's that you can play 
ground-control, running football against them." 
</P>
<P>
Few coaches gave members of the Marmonte and Channel leagues much chance to win 
the title. Thousand Oaks was an exception, having averaged 31.4 points per game 
behind the rushing of Cory Bowen (1,217 yards). Quarterback Todd Preston of 
league rival Westlake has thrown for 2,223 yards and 19 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DIVISION II 
</P>
<P>
Defending Co-Champions -- Muir, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
First-Round Schedule: Friday, 7:30 p.m. -- Rio Mesa (6-4) at Paramount (10-0); 
Westlake (8-1-1) vs. Muir (7-3) at Pasadena City College; Lynwood (5-5) at 
Thousand Oaks (7-1-2); Camarillo (7-3) at Glendale (10-0); Capistrano Valley 
(8-2) at Ventura (7-2-1); Downey (7-3) vs. Royal (8-1-1) at Moorpark College; 
Arcadia (5-5) vs. Mission Viejo (9-1) at Capistrano Valley High School. 
Saturday, 7:30 p.m. -- El Toro (9-1) vs. Buena (5-5) at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Top Teams -- Paramount, Mission Viejo, Glendale and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Dark Horse: Muir. The Mustangs have more Division I college talent than any 
team in the section. 
</P>
<P>
Best Draw: Mission Viejo. The Diablos play host to mediocre Arcadia in the 
first round, then meet the winner of Downey-Royal in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Worst Draw: Paramount. Top-seeded team will probably meet defending co-champion 
Muir in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: Leon Neal and Demondre White, RBs, Paramount; Beau LeBreton, DE, 
and Marcellus Chrishon, RB, Mission Viejo; Pathon Rucker, RB, Glendale; Rob 
Johnson, QB, El Toro; Cory Bowen, RB, Thousand Oaks; Todd Preston, QB, 
Westlake; Sedrick Thomas, QB, Muir; David Poltl, WR, Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy: Paramount, two-time defending Division III champion, has won 18 in 
a row and is 35-2 over the past three years; El Toro, Mission Viejo, Capistrano 
Valley, Paramount, Muir and Thousand Oaks all played overtime games in either 
Division II or III semifinals last year; Glendale's Rucker is the state's 
leading scorer with 192 points.

AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AWAITS COUNTY TEAMS 
</P>

<P>
For the past 12 years, a team from Orange County has won the Division VI 
football championship. But the addition of the Montview League has added some 
uncertainty to a usually clear picture. 
</P>
<P>
"We're totally in the dark," said Roger Takahashi, coach of No. 2-seeded La 
Quinta. "We hope to get an idea after the first round." 
</P>
<P>
For Takahashi, a crash course in eastern San Gabriel Valley football will be 
necessary only if his team defeats Buena Park in the first round Friday, and 
Sierra Vista beats Valencia on Saturday. Four other coaches have taken it 
sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, local coaches had only to be concerned with the Suburban 
League, and after 1977, the first year the playoffs were reformatted, that 
wasn't much of a concern. Since Norwalk defeated Neff in the first title game, 
only one other team from outside the county (La Mirada, 1984) has made it to 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, four Montview League teams -- Pomona, Sierra Vista, San Dimas and 
Bassett -- will try to move in on Orange County's turf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big question mark in our minds, and we have four schools in our league 
that are going to have their questions answered one way or another," said 
Bassett Coach Mark Pettengill, whose team plays top-seeded Tustin on Friday. "I 
hope it's not too hard a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus and seedings certainly point to more success for Orange County, 
home of all four seeded teams. Tustin and La Quinta, both unbeaten, are favored 
to meet for the championship Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
There are some other powerful, playoff-hardened teams within the bracket. No. 3 
Sunny Hills, which lost in the 1989 semifinals to Corona del Mar, has outscored 
its past five opponents, 165-6, and has two of the fastest running backs in the 
division (Mike Sullivan and Kenny Overby). 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's only loss was to No. 4 Brea-Olinda, costing the Tigers the Orange 
League title and a seeding. Fullerton, Newport Harbor and Pacifica are strong 
second-place teams, and Rancho Alamitos probably is the strongest third-place 
team in the division. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, two-time defending champion Corona del Mar is back to try again 
after squeaking into the playoffs with the final Sea View League bid for the 
second year in a row. But the Sea Kings will be without starting quarterback 
Todd Kehrli, who helped them to the title as a sophomore last year. Kehrli 
seriously cut the pinky finger on his throwing hand and has missed the past 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Chad Woolsey has replaced Kehrli, and Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland 
said he has been improving every week. If the Sea Kings survive their 
first-round game Friday with Brea-Olinda, there is a slight chance Kehrli might 
return. If not, Holland is confident that Woolsey will do well. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always going to be a surprise or two, and we're counting on us being 
that surprise," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
The Montview League has no seeded teams and its first-place team, Pomona, is 
5-5. 
</P>
<P>
In three years at Sierra Vista, Coach Don LeGro has turned around a program 
that was 0-19-1 in the two seasons before he came. Led by Joe Ruvalcaba, the 
division's leading rusher with 1,662 yards in 302 carries, Sierra Vista won a 
share of the league title for the first time in the school's 26-year history. 
The Dons' only league loss was to Pomona, 21-14, on a 72-yard touchdown 
scramble by quarterback Johnny McWilliams in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona began the season 1-4 but won four of its last five games after 
McWilliams, who is 6-feet-6 and also plays basketball, took over as 
quarterback. San Dimas, which won its first seven games and was ranked as high 
as third in the division, is led by Matt Harding, who has gained 995 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the furious exchanging of game films and trading information about other 
teams, Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich said it may be an advantage to be in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it may be even better because you hear so much about this team or 
that, up or down, that the players start believing it," Ancich said. "When you 
play someone you don't know about, you find out at game time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DIVISION VI 
</P>
<P>
Defending Champion -- Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
First-Round Schedule: Friday, 7:30 p.m. -- Bassett (5-4-1) at Tustin (10-0); 
Pacifica (7-3) at Fullerton (7-3); Rancho Alamitos (8-2) vs. Pomona (5-5) at 
Bonita High; Corona del Mar (5-4-1) at Brea-Olinda (7-2-1); Savanna (6-2-2) vs. 
Sunny Hills (7-3) at Buena Park High; San Dimas (8-2) at Newport Harbor (7-3); 
Buena Park (5-5) vs. La Quinta (10-0) at Bolsa Grande High. Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 
-- Sierra Vista (8-2) at Valencia (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
Top teams -- Tustin, La Quinta, Sunny Hills, Brea-Olinda, Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Dark Horse: Newport Harbor. The Sailors are on a roll after smashing 
Saddleback, 42-14, to become the Sea View League's second-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
Best Draw: Rancho Alamitos. If the third-place Vaqueros can get by first-round 
opponent Pomona of the Montview League, they will face the winner of Corona del 
Mar and Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
Worst Draw: La Quinta. Although they are seeded No. 2, the Aztecs face a tough 
third-place team, Buena Park, in the first round. And if they win, they play 
either once-beaten Valencia or twice-beaten Sierra Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: Visko Ancich and Ron Goods, RBs, Tustin; Mike Ehli, LB, Valencia; 
D.C. Olsen, LB, Fullerton; Matt Harding, RB, San Dimas; Donald Hopkins, QB/S, 
La Quinta; John Luevanos, QB, Brea-Olinda; Johnny McWilliams, QB, Pomona; Kenny 
Overby and Mike Sullivan, RBs, Sunny Hills; Joe Ruvalcaba, RB, Sierra Vista; 
Ulysses Trammell, RB, Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy: Corona del Mar, the two-time defending champion, is the only school 
to have won consecutive titles in the division/conference since the Southern 
Section playoffs were reformatted in 1977.

SANTA MARGARITA NOW MUST ANSWER TO A HIGHER CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Independence fever is over for Santa Margarita High School. After spending the 
regular season wondering where it would be placed in the playoffs -- compiling 
a 10-0 record along the way -- the Eagles landed in Division IV, five levels 
higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
With the division question answered, Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team, 
has started preparing for its first-round game against Claremont (5-4-1) Friday 
at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good football team, they do a good job throwing the ball, running 
the ball, and they have a very aggressive offensive line -- probably the best 
we'll face all year up to this point," Eagle Coach Jim Hartigan said. "Their 
record is not the greatest, but they've had some big wins. . . . It all depends 
on how they come to play." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Trevor Yankoff and running back Josh Ireland lead Santa Margarita, 
which lost in the Division IX quarterfinals to eventual champion Carpinteria 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yankoff has thrown for 1,087 yards, completing 56.1% of his passes with five 
touchdowns and four interceptions. He has also rushed for nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland has rushed for 1,229 yards -- averaging 7.3 yards per carry -- and 
scored 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Other Santa Margarita standouts include wide receiver/defensive back David 
Shearer, who has caught 22 passes for 316 yards (14.3-yard average). Shearer 
and teammate Steve Feeney have intercepted five passes each. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' biggest offensive lineman, 6-foot-6, 275-pound senior tackle Nathan 
Beckett, missed Monday's practice because of a knee injury suffered in last 
week's game against Warren and is questionable for Friday's game. Tailback 
Sergio Muniz (knee) and linebacker Thad Zak (shoulder) also are questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont, which many expected to win the Baseline League this year, instead 
had a season of ups and downs -- a loss to Damien, a 2-7 team, among the downs 
-- and finished the league season in a second-place tie with Chino (4-4-2). 
</P>
<P>
Claremont is well-balanced, with quarterback Adam Metwalli (1,379 yards, 10 
touchdowns) and running backs Ryan Williams (835 yards, eight touchdowns) and 
Terrill Grant (505 yards, three touchdowns) sharing the offensive load. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Springs, 10-0 and the top-seeded team, features option quarterback Chris 
Ogle, strong, speedy running back Reggie Carter (975 yards, 18 touchdowns) and 
a defense that has allowed an average of just six points per game. Khary 
Williams (750 yards) and Cleveland Smith (400 yards) supplement the Cougars' 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales, 9-0 and seeded second, is a fast, run-oriented team, focusing on the 
option. Tyrone Edwards (900 yards) is the key running back. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora (9-1), the division's co-champion last year with Ramona, is led by 
running back Bill Zernickow, who has gained more than 1,300 yards. Glendora has 
been riddled with injuries, though, losing five starters for the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DIVISION IV 
</P>
<P>
Defending Co-Champions: Glendora, Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
First-Round Schedule: Friday, 7:30 p.m. -- Chino (4-4-2) vs. Canyon Springs 
(10-0) at Moreno High School; California (5-5) at Baldwin Park (7-2-1); Bell 
Gardens (7-3) at Walnut (8-2); Claremont (5-4-1) vs. Santa Margarita (10-0) at 
Saddleback College; Rowland (6-4) at Glendora (9-1); Northview (5-5) at J.W. 
North (8-2); Arlington (7-3) at El Rancho (7-3); Covina (6-4) at Nogales (9-0). 
</P>
<P>
Top Teams: Canyon Springs, Nogales, Glendora, Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Dark Horses: J.W. North, Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Best Draw: Canyon Springs vs. Chino. A victory would match Canyon Springs 
against Baldwin Park or California. 
</P>
<P>
Worst Draw: El Rancho vs. Arlington. Two evenly matched teams, with the winner 
probably advancing to play Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: Reggie Carter, RB, and Chris Ogle, QB, Canyon Springs; Trevor 
Yankoff, QB, and Josh Ireland, RB, Santa Margarita; Henry Preston and Chris 
Hall, RBs, J.W. North; Bill Zernickow, RB, and Tim Flynn, FS, Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy: Undefeated Santa Margarita entered the playoffs as an independent. 
Last year, the Eagles advanced to the Division IX quarterfinals, so Eagle Coach 
Jim Hartigan was disappointed to learn his team had been placed five levels 
higher. Still, Santa Margarita opens at home against a 5-4-1 team (Claremont).

NO SIMPLE SOLUTION WILL FIX RAMS

<P>
The Rams are stuck in the muck of one of those 
if-it's-not-one-thing-it's-another seasons. During the first few games, the 
defense performed as if it were playing in quicksand. Then the defense got out 
of the mire, and an ineffective offense started pulling the team under. 
</P>
<P>
So now everyone wants to know: Where's the O? 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be quite a mystery for the players. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's 31-7 loss to the Giants, tailback Cleveland Gary said he thought 
the Rams were "doing everything well." Then he added a familiar refrain in 
Ramland these days: "It's just a matter of a couple plays here and there." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett is admittedly perplexed. "We just aren't making the 
plays that we're used to making," he says. "Somehow, we've got to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But how? 
</P>
<P>
Here's some theories on Where the O Went: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams' finesse, pass-oriented approach, with precision timing a 
prerequisite, is bound to be less consistent than a more simple style. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game against the Giants shed some light on recent woes. The teams 
played even football for more than a half, but somewhere in the third quarter, 
the Rams' finely tuned offense began to misfire. The Rams passed for 74 yards 
in the second half. New York's blood-and-guts attack kept plowing away, and the 
result was a rout. 
</P>
<P>
All of which points out one of the drawbacks of the Ram offense. Like any 
complicated, high-tech machine, there are a lot of little things that can go 
wrong. And that pretty much sums up the offensive troubles to date. No major 
breakdowns. Lots of minor glitches. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of balls that were almost in our hands, or just ticked off us, or 
we dropped," Coach John Robinson said. "We couldn't sustain anything. We're 
just not making the plays we have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Opponents are more familiar with these kinds of offenses now and defending 
them better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's an ongoing cycle," Robinson said. "This offense will be a good 
offense in 1997, I think. It's the execution of it that determines success." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preseason injuries to wide receivers knocked the passing game out of whack, 
and the Rams still haven't found their rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries to Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox, Everett 
spent the preseason refining his timing with backup receivers. Ellard led the 
three in exhibitions with one catch. But all three played in the season opener 
at Green Bay, and the Rams figured all would be well with the passing game in a 
couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And, at times, the Rams have flashed back to '89. Everett threw for 372 yards 
against Cincinnati and 302 against Atlanta, but he has also fallen short of 200 
in three of the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maybe it's really all the fault of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is quick to point out that the Rams have been facing some pretty steep 
deficits recently. After all, there's only so much an offense can do when 
facing a two- or three-touchdown disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're way out of balance in terms of running and passing," he said. "You need 
a combination of play that includes the ability to stay even in the football 
game and not get pushed on the edges by the scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's too early to panic -- the Rams are fifth in the league in offense -- 
but maybe Robinson should be thinking about getting a punishing tailback and 
big, dominant offensive line and . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When we were running the football all the time, people said, 'You're never 
gonna win without a pass offense,' " Robinson said, managing a smile. "Now we 
have a pass offense, and it doesn't click. You tend to think, 'Gosh, if you ran 
the football, you probably would (win).' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insists he's a long way from altering, much less abandoning, offensive 
coordinator Ernie Zampese's system. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want to say, 'Gee, why don't we do what the Giants do and be 
the Giants. Or be the Kansas City Chiefs,' " Robinson said. "I don't think we 
want to do anything other than our scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"When evaluating styles, you have to remember that a system like the Giants' is 
built on the premise that they have as good a defense as there is in the 
league. What we have to do is do what we do better than we've been doing it." 
</P>
<P>
So how often does Robinson remind himself that his team could break out of the 
offensive doldrums and spend the rest of the season racing up and down the 
field? 
</P>
<P>
"Every night when I lay me down to sleep," he says.

SHOT DOWN LAST SEASON, WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM SEEKS TO REGAIN PRIDE

<P>
Somewhere along the road to a 1-27 record last season, Kathy Lizarraga says, UC 
Irvine's women's basketball team lost its vision of what it was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
The players and the coaches couldn't see eye-to-eye. Squabbles and jealousies 
broke out. And if you want to talk about losing sight of goals, go straight to 
Lizarraga, who literally did. 
</P>
<P>
Lizarraga is the Anteaters' designated three-point shooter. She wears contact 
lenses, which were giving her trouble before one game and became unwearable. 
</P>
<P>
The way things were going, Lizarraga didn't want to cause trouble. Afraid to 
tell Coach Dean Andrea what had happened, she tried to play without them. 
</P>
<P>
She shot the ball in the general direction of the goal, aiming roughly for the 
white box on the glass. 
</P>
<P>
She was awful. 
</P>
<P>
But shooters are supposed to keep shooting, and Lizarraga did. By halftime, she 
hadn't made a basket, and when Andrea learned what was going on, he sat her on 
the bench for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of season. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters are back for another go at it this year, and Lizarraga is back 
with extra lenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three pairs now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea says the team is working together to avoid a repeat of last season as 
Irvine heads into its first exhibition game against the Bulgarian national team 
at 2 p.m. Sunday in Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lizarraga, a junior who made 37 three-pointers and averaged 8.8 points per game 
last season, is back, along with nine other letter-winners. Also returning are 
Jenny Lee, a senior point guard, and Yvonne Catala, a sophomore forward who led 
the team in scoring last year with an 11-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Will this season unfold any better than last? They'll have to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
They lost by a sliver, but it doesn't matter a smidgen. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine women's cross-country team lost the NCAA Region 8 meet to Oregon by 
a single point Saturday, but because the top two teams in each region qualified 
for the NCAA championships Monday at Knoxville, Tenn., the difference was 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll drop from fifth to sixth in the rankings," said Coach Vince O'Boyle, 
whose team was ranked fourth for a time this season, the highest ever for an 
Irvine team. "If (the NCAA championships) were seeded like basketball, it might 
be a problem, but the way it is, it doesn't mean a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA water polo championships begin a week from Friday at Belmont Plaza 
pool in Long Beach, with Irvine, the defending national champion, as host. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Irvine to be in the water. The Anteaters are about to conclude 
the first losing season in the program's 26-year history and are not expected 
to get a bid. Hosting the tournament won't be much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go hide somewhere, in all reality," Coach Ted Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine will take a 13-15 record into its final game Saturday against UC Santa 
Barbara at Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be much better next year," said Newland, who says after 25 
seasons that retirement is still not imminent. "I enjoyed this year," he said. 
"I was embittered at times, but these are basically neat human beings. They 
worked hard at improving, and their attitude is good." 
</P>
<P>
Timber! Another former Anteater has fallen in with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
This time it is Bob Thornton, acquired in a trade last week from the 
Philadelphia 76ers for a second-round draft pick in 1991. He joins former 
Anteaters Scott Brooks and Tod Murphy. Johnny Rogers had been with the team but 
was cut. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Elzie Love, a 6-6 swingman from Perris High School who earlier said he has 
committed to Irvine, is expected to sign a national letter of intent with the 
Anteaters during the signing period that begins today. Coach Bill Mulligan said 
there's a possibility that one or two others will sign early. Two standout high 
school girls have said they plan to sign with Irvine -- Brea-Olinda's Jinelle 
Williams and Christina Adams of El Cajon Granite Hills. . . . After two meets, 
freshman swimmer Liz Koch has the fourth-best 200-yard backstroke time 
(2:17.66) in school history. The women's swim team will compete against 
Pepperdine and Cal State Bernardino at Pepperdine Saturday, while the men's 
team is off for two weeks. . . . The women's volleyball team will finish its 
season Tuesday in Crawford Hall against Cal State Long Beach, a team the 
Anteaters have not beaten since 1983.

TITAN POINT GUARD MIGHT NEED SURGERY

Cal State Fullerton point guard Wayne Williams, the Titans' only returning 
full-time starter, might have to have surgery to remove a bone chip in his 
ankle, Coach John Sneed said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who averaged 9.8 points and 7.2 assists per game last season, will 
undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test on the ankle today to determine the 
severity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Titan trainer Jerry Lloyd said the size and location of the bone chip would 
determine whether surgery was required. There's also a chance that Williams, 
who has experienced nagging pain in the ankle for several weeks and missed 
practice Monday and Tuesday, suffered a stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said that if surgery isn't necessary, Williams would receive cortisone 
shots and could play when the pain subsides. That would put the junior on a 
day-to-day status. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Bradbury, a 6-foot-4 guard from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, 
has made an oral commitment to play basketball at Fullerton. Bradbury, who 
plays point guard and shooting guard, said he will sign a national letter of 
intent today or Thursday. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

BIOTECHNOLOGY: IRVINE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS SUSPENDING EFFORTS TO 
OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL TO USE MACHINE FOR GALLSTONE REMOVAL CLOUDS ITS FUTURE 
PROSPECTS.

Raising questions about its future, Medstone International Inc. said Tuesday it 
has "indefinitely suspended" its efforts to win federal approval to market its 
medical technology for removing gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it had been discouraged by the expense and time that would be 
required to conduct further clinical tests and by an eroding demand for its 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows closely on the heels of the resignation earlier this 
month of Freeman Rose, Medstone's co-founder and co-inventor of the company's 
lithotripter machine that was designed to use shock waves to disintegrate 
kidney stones and gallstones. The scientific community also has raised 
questions recently about the effectiveness of lithotripters to remove 
gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
In April of 1988 the company obtained approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration to market the machine for treatment of kidney stones, causing 
sales of the machines to soar briefly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Medstone's sales of lithotripters, which cost about $1.4 million each, 
plummeted after it became apparent that the company probably would not be able 
to win FDA approval to sell its lithotripter for treatment of gallstones -- 
which is considered a much larger and more lucrative market. 
</P>
<P>
A cloud has hung over the company's prospects since October of last year when a 
physician advisory panel to the FDA refused to recommend Medstone's 
lithotripters as a non-surgical alternative for removing gallstones. The 
panel's recommendation was considered crucial to obtaining FDA approval. Also, 
other methods for treating gallstones have been developed that have reduced 
potential demand for the lithotripter. 
</P>
<P>
After Medstone went public in June, 1988, its stock shot up to a high of $39.50 
a share. But the stock has fallen sharply as prospects of FDA approval for 
gallstone treatments waned and the company faced management turnover and legal 
troubles. The stock closed Tuesday at $1.63 a share. The trading day had ended 
when the company made its announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone was also hit by a shareholder suit in October, 1989, alleging that 
officers withheld unfavorable information about the company's business 
prospects. That suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Medstone lost $3.7 million on revenue of 
$8.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone officials were not available to comment Tuesday on the impact of their 
decision on the future business of Medstone, which had counted heavily on 
entering the gallstone market. 
</P>
<P>
However, Medstone's president, Richard Ferrari, said in a prepared statement, 
"Although we are disappointed, this action will allow us to focus our 
lithotripsy marketing efforts on kidney stones, where we have full approval." 
</P>
<P>
The company also said its board of directors is "exploring new growth 
opportunities in the health care industry. Internal projects and strategic 
joint ventures are being evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
Medstone's ability to greatly expand its sales of lithotripters for kidney 
applications is limited in large part because the market has been saturated by 
competitors who also make lithotripters. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, health care analyst for Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach 
securities brokerage, said Medstone officials recently told him their strategy 
will be to distribute a dozen lithotripters they now have in inventory to 
hospitals at no cost. The hospitals will pay the company a fee, however, each 
time the equipment is used. The company so far has obtained orders for five of 
its machines under this arrangement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Selwitz said Medstone officials told him that in the meantime they will search 
out firms that have developed other kinds of expensive high-tech health care 
equipment that Medstone could add to its product line. He said Medstone has 
about $9 million in cash with which to go shopping for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Selwitz said he expects Medstone to post a heavy loss for 1990 and rebound next 
year "to about the break-even point." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is the great rainbow out there that people had 
anticipated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kilpatrick, an analyst with Newport Securities in Costa Mesa, said in 
light of Tuesday's announcement it is "very difficult to evaluate" Medstone's 
business prospects. "It's anybody's guess," he said.

AD EXECUTIVES BACK CLIENT CLOTHESTIME BY BUYING SHARES

<P>
Two Los Angeles advertising executives are putting their money where their 
commercials are -- Clothestime Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Roth and Robert Recht, president and chairman respectively of Los 
Angeles-based Admarketing Inc., are leading a group of investors who have 
acquired a 6.35% stake in the Anaheim-based discount retail chain that sells 
women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The group purchased almost 748,500 shares between Sept. 20 and Nov. 9, 
according to a Security and Exchange Commission filing released this week. The 
group now holds 895,000 shares of Clothestime, making it the company's third 
largest stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
Admarketing, one of the largest ad agencies in Los Angeles, has handled 
Clothestime's advertising account for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said in a telephone interview that he bought the shares because he thinks 
Clothestime stock is a relative bargain. He added that he started buying shares 
in the company months ago at $3 and $4. The group bought its 748,500 shares at 
prices between $1.44 and $1.94. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime's stock rallied 50 cents Tuesday to close at $2.375 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the company and its future," Roth said. "And the price was so 
low it appeared to be a good buy." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he has invested heavily in other clients of his ad agency as well, 
including C&amp;R Clothiers and the Good Guys. He holds a smaller number of 
shares in Home Depot as well. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime's low stock price reflects market worries about its performance and 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company's founder and chief executive, Michael DeAngelo, recently retired 
at age 41, and the company's chief financial officer quit in September in the 
wake of projections of shrinking profits for the chain of 370 stores. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the company estimated its earnings for the fiscal year ended Jan. 
26 at $140,000 to $702,000, far below some analysts' earlier predictions that 
earnings could reach as high as $2.8 million. But last week Clothestime 
announced that its October sales were $13.3 million, a 10% increase over the 
same month last year, and that its sales for the first nine months of the year 
were $152.3 million, up 7% over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
And the company was listed by Newport Securities recently as one of 15 Orange 
County companies whose shares are selling below book value because of 
"exaggerated pessimism" in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he is fully aware of Clothestime's past difficulties, but is hopeful 
it will make a turnaround. "They have learned both from the good things that 
have happened to them and from the bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as investing goes, Roth said he's wagering that Admarketing's 
commercials will make his stake in Clothestime a good investment. "If you can't 
bet on yourself," he added, "who are you going to bet on?" 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime officials could not be reached for comment about the stock 
purchase.

DISNEYLAND TO TAKE INSTANT PICTURES OF BREATHLESS RIDERS ON SPLASH MOUNTAIN

Smile! Come this spring, you could be on the Disney camera. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland officials plan to install a special video camera on Splash Mountain 
to take photographs of the riders just as they begin the scary, high-speed 
plummet down the flume. The pictures will then to offered to the riders -- for 
a price. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came from Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, who was impressed 
with press photographs of himself riding Splash Mountain when the attraction 
debuted in July, 1989. He asked whether a camera could be mounted to take 
pictures of guests at the top of the five-story, 46-degree drop near the end of 
the ride. 
</P>
<P>
John Cora, a Disneyland vice president, said Disney has been testing the camera 
for several months. He said the theme park hopes to have the camera installed 
in time for the Easter holiday. The sales price of the photos has not been 
determined yet. 
</P>
<P>
The new camera system will solve the problem of how to take closeup photos of 
family and friends on the popular ride, which is located in the park's Critter 
Country area. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you don't see the boats coming, you have to have split-second 
accuracy," Cora said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Disneyland official said some shutterbugs have stood for more than an 
hour outside the ride, waiting for the brief instant when a friend or loved one 
came hurtling down the flume of the man-made mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The camera will capture the image of people as they duck their heads under a 
mist cloud before they begin their descent, Cora said. 
</P>
<P>
The image will be transmitted electronically to a video screen at the end of 
the ride, where guests can view the picture. If they want to buy one, a Disney 
employee can have one instantly printed out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try it on this attraction. We might expand it to other parks, 
too," Cora said. "We're designing a whole new area at the end of Splash 
Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
For guests who insist on taking their own photographs of friends or family 
riding Splash Mountain, Disneyland intends to build a raised platform at the 
base of the mountain that will be closer to the action. 
</P>
<P>
On busy days, large crowds gather at the base of the mountain's longest drop 
and sometimes block the walkway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cora said early tests of the video camera have been promising. "It's going to 
be the greatest," he said.

SIGMUND FREUD ART COLLECTION: A DREAM AT UCI; 
</P>
<P>
LIKE ANY PASSIONATE ART COLLECTOR, THE FATHER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS WAS FUELED BY 
MOTIVES SO DEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED THEM HIMSELF.

<TEXT>
<P>
In March, 1938, the Nazis marched into Vienna. By May they were rounding up 
Jews to scrub sidewalks with toothbrushes or to be packed off to the camps. At 
Berggasse 19, tension mounted as Sigmund Freud's family prepared to flee 
Austria. His daughter, Anna, was exercising guile worthy of Metternich to 
persuade the SS to give her father Unbedenklichkeitserklarung, the official 
document that would allow him to immigrate to England. 
</P>
<P>
The father of psychoanalysis was 82 and ailing. His rabid fondness for cigars 
had finally given him cancer of the mouth. His palate had been surgically 
removed and replaced with a prosthesis that caused him unremitting pain. With 
his life at stake, the old man still found time to worry about a matter others 
would have forgotten in such extremity: Would his art collection be saved? 
</P>
<P>
Freud started collecting in 1896, the year his father died. By the time the 
Nazis arrived, he had more than 2,000 small antique works -- Egyptian, 
Etruscan, Greek, Roman, Near-Eastern and Asian. They crammed his comfortable 
consulting room and office. For him they were powerful symbols of his work and 
treasured old friends. 
</P>
<P>
Touchingly, he kept rows of figures ever before him on his desk as a king might 
keep a council of elders -- or a boy rows of favorite model soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on May 23, he could write to a friend that the collection had been 
released for a minimal levy of about $100. He was free. The beloved compendium 
was reassembled in the Freuds' new London digs at 20 Maresfield Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Freud would have a year to be consoled by it before he died. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the stolid brick London house is the Freud Museum. The antiquities it 
contains were not his only artistic legacy. His grandson Lucien Freud still 
lives in London and is regarded among the world's leading figurative painters. 
</P>
<P>
A traveling exhibition of 65 works from Freud's collection is currently showing 
at UC Irvine (to Dec. 16). 
</P>
<P>
Put together by Freud Museum director Richard Wells and art historian Lynn 
Gamwell, it is a show that resonates well beyond its own modest proportions and 
should attract anyone interested in either art or psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it requires a considerable effort of ignorance to be interested in 
one and not the other. 
</P>
<P>
Many shrinks will admit their craft is more art than science. Most artists will 
readily confess that the end result of their labors is not so much the physical 
artwork as its emotional impact first on themselves, then on the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Does a work of art really exist if no one sees it? Why does it exist when 
someone does see it? 
</P>
<P>
Because, I suppose, our minds are unruly cellars cluttered with remembered 
images -- images of things, feelings and events. When we see a work of art, the 
mind matches it up with those matrix images and we respond. In a way, we all 
have an art collection pre-existent in our heads. If we put together a real 
collection of objects, it is predictably the projection of our mindscape and 
our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
It's really all rather Freudian. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Freud's collection of archetypal objects tends to confirm the 
theories of his one-time follower Carl Jung. At this distance, disagreements in 
doctrine between members of the Freud circle do seem tiresomely petty. 
</P>
<P>
Freud had a classical education. Significantly, he did not collect primitive 
art, but art from civilizations he had studied. He had a pretty good eye, 
although he bought several fakes, such as a forged Chinese camel in Tang style 
and a bogus Egyptian New Kingdom wall relief on view here. 
</P>
<P>
The art critic Roger Fry claimed that Freud didn't understand the formal 
underpinnings of aesthetic pleasure. That probably proves that Fry didn't 
understand the profound emotional foundations of aesthetic pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
At his best, Freud found objects that carry emotional authenticity and -- aside 
from their powerful symbolic value -- objects with nuanced delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lovely freshness about a Greek Hellenistic Eros figure and great 
sensitivity of carving in an Egyptian Ptolemaic donation stele. Two tiny Roman 
Hellenistic heads concentrate ferocious emotion. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the point. Like any passionate collector, Freud was fueled by 
motives so deep he could not have explained them himself. That's saying 
something, considering his claim to have been the only man to ever successfully 
psychoanalyze himself. 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, Freud admired and envied Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer and 
excavator of ancient Troy. Schliemann gave reality to a city thought to exist 
only in legend. Freud gave reality to a part of the human mind believed equally 
fictional. 
</P>
<P>
In his practice, Freud saw himself as an archeologist of the mind unearthing 
lost fragments of memory and trying to fit them once again into a coherent 
whole. The archeological metaphor was so persuasive that psychotherapists use 
it to this day, furnishing their own offices with magical objects. Shamanism 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine how Freud must have regarded his little late-Egyptian bronze of Isis 
suckling the infant Horus. He would have known the mythical story of how Isis' 
husband Osiris was killed by a jealous brother, hacked into 14 pieces and 
scattered across the land. Isis found the dismembered pieces, put them back 
together, made Osiris the first mummy and coupled with it to produce the infant 
Horus. The child was raised in secret until he was old enough to avenge the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Very Freudian. 
</P>
<P>
Freud adored his mother and envied his father. When he learned of the Greek 
myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother, he 
decided his own impulse was universal and identified the most famous of his 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
A Greek terra cotta Sphinx memorializes the moment when Oedipus outwits the 
winged lion-woman by answering her riddle. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his cherished objects bore directly on personal experiences, such as a 
falcon-headed figure that reminded him of a childhood dream. Janus-faced heads 
reflect his interest in human dualities, including his claim that we are 
fundamentally bisexual. His interest in the duality of instinct and reason 
reflect in one of the collection's most beautiful works, an Egyptian-Roman 
"Baboon of Thoth" -- the animal god of intellectual purity. 
</P>
<P>
Freud had mixed and sometimes conventional notions about women. The driving 
narcissism he claimed to find in them is embodied in a Roman bronze Venus 
admiring herself in a glass. The power he felt in them shows in figures of 
goddesses of aggression such as Athena and Artemis. 
</P>
<P>
Freud was certainly among the most influential half-dozen thinkers of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
His ideas have been attacked, ridiculed, revised and revered until lesser 
people have declared us in a "Post-Freudian" era. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Freud did not get it all right. But his real achievement comes 
across in the extraordinary reverberations of his collection. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because we know these things were his, we are reminded they have 
meaning beyond their formal properties. They do what art is supposed to do and 
what Freud tried to revitalize in reality. They broadcast the unseen things 
which -- once grasped -- give life a profound vitality.

"Bash '90," the 20th annual festival sponsored by the Orange County Musicians 
Union, Local 7 of the American Federation of Musicians, grossed "well above 
$15,000," union secretary-treasurer Bob Stava said Tuesday. The event, held 
Sunday at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesta, enlisted about 300 local musicians 
and drew between 1,200 and 1,300 people, Stava said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After paying expenses for sound equipment rental and other charges, remaining 
money will go into the Musicians' Emergency Relief and Scholarship funds. Last 
year, the Bash cleared about $9,000, and Stava said he expects the net this 
year to exceed that figure.

RESTIVO NETS HUMOR FROM LIFE'S SNARES; 
</P>
<P>
STAND-UP: THE COMIC, WHO IS AT THE LAFF STOP IN NEWPORT BEACH THROUGH SUNDAY, 
LETS HIS CHARACTER STUDIES EXPOSE 'MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in his comedy career, Joe Restivo wrote jokes for Rodney Dangerfield, 
Freddie Prinze, Joan Rivers and David Frye. But the Chicago-born comedian is 
not one to buy jokes for his own stand-up act. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I tried to buy material from other people," he said. "But even if I 
like a few things, it doesn't feel right. There are guys who buy jokes, but 
they're joke tellers, and I'm not a joke teller. Most of my stuff comes out of 
character." 
</P>
<P>
A TV producer once described Restivo's humor as "middle-class Angst." But don't 
ask the comedian, who is at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach today through 
Sunday, to define his own comedy style. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," he said in a phone interview from his Los Angeles home. "I'm 
asked that question a zillion times. All I can tell you is I do a character 
study and a lot of the character is me, in an exaggerated form. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talk about people being trapped by the world -- by their stress, their 
anger, their reaction to being trapped. I believe that we're all sort of 
trapped by something: Relationships will trap us, work will trap us, dreams 
could be a trap -- or the lack of dreams -- poor planning . . . living in the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
But don't get the wrong idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that my show is very uplifting," he said. "I talk about negative 
things, but ultimately I think that we can survive the Angst. But you have to 
be aware it's there first. When you realize what it is, then you can dump it." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound a bit philosophical for someone who makes people laugh for a 
living. But Restivo actually has a master's degree in philosophy. He also has a 
master's degree in business and a bachelor's in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he was working in New York City as international marketing director 
for the company that makes Ponds facial cream and Vaseline petroleum jelly in 
1976 when he saw his first live stand-up comedian at the New York Improv. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was home," he said. "I knew I was funny. I just didn't know how 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
By hanging out at the Improv every night, he began writing jokes for comedians. 
By 1980, he was doing his own stand-up act. 
</P>
<P>
Quitting his job to get into show business was not really that big a switch for 
Restivo: He was a child performer who had a recording contract in high school 
under the name Joey Richards and recorded, among others, "Summer Love" in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Given today's breed of comics, Restivo doesn't view his university background 
as being all that unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be in the old days, 30 years ago, guys did stand-up because that's 
all they could do," he said. "They had to get out of the lower classes and the 
tenements. Now most of the guys have degrees. They're making real choices. It's 
a whole different ballgame. That's why the texture of the material is different 
than it used to be. Most of the comics are prettybright." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean he's putting down "the older guys," Restivo said. "It used to 
be just 'My wife is so fat. . . .' Now comics are talking about the world, 
issues, relationships, emotions -- really investigating life more." 
</P>
<P>
When he's not writing and performing his own comedy, Restivo is writing TV and 
movie scripts. He also acts and has been in 80 TV shows, mostly dramas. On Nov. 
25 he will appear in an ABC-TV movie, "I'll Take Romance," starring Linda Evans 
and Tom Skerritt. 
</P>
<P>
Restivo, who will make another appearance on "Late Night With David Letterman" 
in a few weeks, is also co-producing a sitcom pilot. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously has no regrets about abandoning his career marketing face cream 
and Vaseline. 
</P>
<P>
"Far from it," he said. "We've made a good life. We've got three kids, a nice 
big house, expensive cars -- so I recommend it highly."

UPSHAW ENJOYS THE CHALLENGE OF HER VARIED CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
SOPRANO LIKES OPERA, RECITALS, CHAMBER MUSIC AND RECORDINGS. SHE SAYS SHE'D GET 
BORED WITH JUST ONE THING.

<P>
Despite her status as a rising international star, soprano Dawn Upshaw hasn't 
lost touch with her Midwest roots. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to sing in English. I like to sing American," Upshaw, 30, said in a 
recent phone interview from London, where she was recording Charpentier's "Te 
Deum" and "Magnificat" with Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. 
Martin-in-the-Fields for EMI. 
</P>
<P>
She will have a chance to sing in both languages, plus German and French, in a 
recital sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society on Thursday at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre. Accompanied by pianist Margo Garrett, Upshaw will sing 
works by Purcell, Poulenc, Wolf, Rachmaninoff and Barber. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like starting the program with Purcell and ending it with Barber," 
she said. "I don't know if a listener will appreciate it in the same way as I 
do. But I see a kind of drama and development between the two composers. . . . 
They are both quite dramatic and just evoke a strong religious theme, which 
ties the beginning and the end of the recital." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, she did not describe herself as a "directly religious" person. "I 
think spiritual is a better word," she said. "Yes, I think of my voice as a 
gift." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw grew up in Park Forest, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, but although she had 
been singing all her life (mainly folk songs and in a church choir), she did 
not consider a professional career in music until after she received a graduate 
degree from the Manhattan School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
Things moved fast once she did. In 1984, she won the Young Concerts Artists 
International Auditions and secured a place in the Metropolitan Opera's Young 
Artist Development program. That led to her first major role at the Met, in 
February, 1988, as Adina in Donizetti's "L'elisir d'amore" under the baton of 
James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
Levine has served as a mentor, casting her not only at the Met but also at the 
Ravinia Festival in Chicago and in concert in Berlin. Other luminaries she has 
worked with include Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood, Mass., Zubin Mehta in Los 
Angeles and Nikolaus Harnoncourt in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Among other honors, Upshaw has also won a Grammy Award for her 1989 recording 
of songs by Harbison, Barber, Menotti and Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
How has all this attention affected her? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get nervous in the same way," she said. "I get more excited than 
nervous. Certainly, there are times I get a stomachache and am worried in the 
sense of wanting to do so well, wanting everything to go perfectly. But that 
doesn't happen as often as it used to, probably because I've gathered more 
courage and confidence about who I am as an artist and what's important to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I know my strengths and weaknesses. I can live with them, and as long 
as the public is interested in hearing me sing and can live with my weaknesses, 
I'll continue." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't pause long at listing what she considers as her "weakness." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that my voice is limited in a way because it's a smaller type of 
voice, but not real small," she said. "It certainly is no more than a lyric 
soprano." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some artists who switch from one teacher to another, Upshaw has stuck 
with the same one "for about eight years." 
</P>
<P>
"I always find it difficult to go around from teacher to teacher," she said. 
"That can play havoc with your voice unless you have confidence to pick and 
save from what to use." 
</P>
<P>
She credits that training with giving her the flexibility to pursue opera and 
recital work. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely feel I have quite a varied career, a varied spectrum," she said. 
"I enjoy it all. I enjoy the opera, the recitals, chamber music every year and 
now recordings. It's all challenging and interesting. If I stuck with any one 
thing, I think I'd get kind of bored." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw enjoys sharing her voice in speech as well as in song. 
</P>
<P>
"I often say a little something, not very much at concerts," she said. "There's 
a huge difference in the way that an audience listens once I've opened my mouth 
to speak rather than just to sing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, if they're not expecting you to speak, you suddenly seem more human 
when you do speak to them, and I think they listen a little more differently 
once you've done that. It just opens the door for a closer kind of bond between 
the performer and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in her career, Upshaw doesn't worry too much about her vocal 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if I thought about it too much, I'd become perhaps a little obsessive 
and paranoid," she said. "I hardly think at all about my throat. In terms of 
taking care of myself, if I eat well and sleep well -- primarily if I get 
enough sleep -- I'll stay healthy. Beyond that, I really don't worry about it 
or even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
What does she see as the next step in her career? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know," she said. "I guess I would like to slow down a little 
bit. We'd like to have another child." (Upshaw is married to musicologist 
Michael Nott, son of her former voice teacher, David Nott, at Illinois Wesleyan 
University. They have a daughter, Sarah, who is almost a year old.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'd probably want to settle down a little more," she added. "I certainly don't 
have an international career that a lot of other singers do. What little work 
I've done internationally, that might lessen a bit each year. I think I'll 
always want to come to Europe and do some concerts and some opera roles each 
year. But coming over and staying and staying for a long time is not something 
that appeals to me."

Southern California composer William Kraft has taken home the top prize in the 
prestigious 1990 Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards for New American Music. 
</P>
<P>
One of four finalists, Kraft was presented with the award Oct. 28 at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft shares the first-place slot with Chicago composer Ralph Shapey. Each 
received $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course anyone would want to be the first-place winner," Kraft, 67, said 
from his hillside Altadena home. "But I am very proud to be the first-place 
winner along with Shapey. He's an extremely respected composer, and I'm very 
honored." 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the Orchestra of the Mannes School of Music, conducted by 
Michael Charry, played the four chosen works for a small audience and for the 
three judges: Tim Page, a New York Times music critic, and conductors David 
Zinman and Werner Torkanowsky. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's composition, "Veils and Variations for Horn and Orchestra," was 
nominated by Paul Polivnick, music director for the Alabama Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft has written about 100 compositions, including "Concerto for Four 
Percussion Soloists and Orchestra," first conducted by Zubin Mehta and now 
Kraft's most oft-played work. Kraft was a percussionist for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic for eight years, a timpanist for 18 years and later 
composer-in-residence and assistant conductor there. He also founded the 
Philharmonic New Music Group, and today teaches at various California colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's appearance at the Kennedy Friedheim competition marks the third time he 
has been nominated. In 1986 his "Timpani Concerto" took second prize, and in 
1987 he was a semifinalist for his string quartet "Weavings." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been wonderful," Kraft said of snaring first place at last. "I've never 
had so many congratulatory greetings."

Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine today announced a bid to oust 
Margaret Thatcher from the British premiership she has held for 11 years and 
rejected criticism that it was wrong to force the contest during the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57 and a self-made millionaire, said he would run against the "Iron 
Lady" in a ballot beginning Tuesday for the leadership of the ruling 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins will be prime minister. Aides said Thatcher, 65, is "determined to 
fight and win." But some politicians said she is fighting for her political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
A first ballot of elected Conservative legislators is scheduled for Tuesday, 
when Thatcher will be in Paris for a 34-nation European summit. Heseltine is 
not expected to win outright. He would need 159 of 372 votes to force a second 
ballot, if all legislators voted.

FOG SHROUDS ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A thick blanket of fog covered most of Orange County's coastal communities 
early this morning, prompting partial closure of John Wayne Airport and 
snarling rush-hour traffic along the San Diego Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility here is zero," Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Joe Davies 
said at 8:30 a.m. from the John Wayne Airport tower. 
</P>
<P>
Davies said all early morning commercial flights, which normally begin at 7 
a.m., were either canceled or delayed. Flights resumed about 9 a.m., but the 
changes in flight schedules forced air commuters to make last-minute 
adjustments to their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat in the plane for about an hour, then were told to wait," said Greg 
Paydock, one of dozens of businessmen scrambling to banks of phone booths. 
"That was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers sat in the airport coffee shops and bars or browsed in the 
gift shops to pass the time. Some even caught a quick nap. 
</P>
<P>
"You can hang him from a meat hook, and he'll fall asleep," said Irvine 
businessman Pat Diamond about his partner, Phil McCarty, as the latter slouched 
in a chair, lost in sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittman, a meteorologist for WeatherData, based in Wichita, Kan, said the 
fog caused problems in many parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The fog is pretty much widespread up and down the coast," he said, adding that 
the fog was created by a storm front in the Gulf of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement authorities reported numerous rush-hour traffic collisions as 
motorists tried to get to work in visibility as low as 25 feet.

ISRAEL CRACKS DOWN ON PALESTINIANS

Israel launched a new crackdown on the nearly 3-year-old Palestinian uprising 
today, imposing widespread curfews and announcing plans to halve the Arab work 
force from the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
The curfews were to prevent demonstrations on the eve of the second anniversary 
of the Palestinian state declared by the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
parliament in exile on Nov. 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The measures also came a day after two key pro-PLO Palestinian activists were 
ordered jailed for six months without trial for alleged involvement in inciting 
a wave of attacks against Israelis in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli left-wingers protested the detentions of Radwan Abu Ayyash, 40, of 
Ramallah in the West Bank and Ziad Abu Ziad, 50, of Jerusalem. Abu Ayyash heads 
the Arab Journalists' Union, and Abu Ziad edits a Hebrew-language Palestinian 
weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"The message of the Israeli government to the Palestinian leadership is clear: 
There is no point in being a moderate," said Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' 
Rights Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin of the left-of-center Labor Party warned that "the price is liable 
to be more unnecessary bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
The curfews in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip confined about 420,000 
people indoors. Schools were also shut in the West Bank, keeping 300,000 Arab 
pupils away from classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, authorities rounded up 1,350 Palestinians working without security 
permits, Army radio said. The sweep was part of a campaign launched last month 
in the wake of a spate of stabbing attacks in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister David Magen said the government will institute new policies that 
he expected to cut by more than half the number of Palestinians working in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The government will discuss new labor laws. The significance will be a serious 
reduction in the number of workers from the territories," Magen said on Israel 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Magen added he expected 60,000 of about 108,000 Palestinians employed in Israel 
to lose their jobs. The slack would be taken up by Soviet immigrants and 
discharged soldiers, he said.

BLIND WOMAN DIES FLEEING FIRE

<P>
A blind Sepulveda woman died this morning as she tried to flee from a fire that 
erupted in a bedroom of her apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the woman, who investigators believe was in her late 50s, was not 
released pending notification of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Two security guards at the two-story apartment building in the 15100 block of 
Parthenia Street pulled the woman out of her unit. Paramedics pronounced her 
dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was confined to her unit and was extinguished in 18 minutes, fire 
officials said. The cause of the blaze, which caused an estimated $15,000, is 
under investigation. Authorities said smoke detectors were operating in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said that one bedroom was heavily damaged and that a 
portion of the living room ceiling had burned. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the fire started in one of the bedrooms. There was a lot of heat 
coming out of the room," said detective Mike Brandt, who responded to the fire. 
"Part of a wall was burned and acoustic ceiling had fallen." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said there is no evidence of foul play.

A federal panel waited five months before announcing its finding that steroids 
can halve the death rate from the pneumonia that is the leading killer of 
people with AIDS, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The panel withheld the announcement until Oct. 10 because members could not 
agree on how to word their statement, the New York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason they could not agree, said panel Vice Chairman Dr. Paul 
Meier, was that the findings had not yet been accepted at a prestigious medical 
journal, and they feared that an early announcement would jeopardize 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Many medical journals have a policy of not publishing studies that have been 
reported in the popular press. The journals say the policy is aimed at ensuring 
that studies are subjected to scrutiny by disinterested scientists.

U.S. Roman Catholic bishops launched a major program today to help churches of 
Eastern Europe recover from their prolonged suppression under communism. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting the plan, Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis said churches there 
have suffered a "man-made disaster" resulting from years of persecution. 
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of communism, he said, they are "like a man just emerging 
from the darkness of a cave, standing there, blinking in the bright light of 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a 
succession of about a dozen bishops took the floor to back a national church 
collection to pay for the aid project.

The African National Congress today called for urgent land redistribution to 
end the white domination of property and to restore land that blacks lost under 
apartheid laws. 
</P>
<P>
In its first comprehensive report on a future land policy, the group said that 
nationalizing property was one of several options for reaching a more equitable 
distribution of land. 
</P>
<P>
"In the context of a mixed economy, there would only be selective 
nationalization, and . . . the distribution of this land would be based on 
land-use needs," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It said landowners in those cases would be compensated in cash and bonds.

A jury today convicted a woman in the arsenic-poisoning death of a former 
boyfriend. She is also accused of poisoning her first husband and trying to 
kill her current spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, showed no reaction when the murder verdict was read. 
The sons of victim Raymond Reid, who died in 1986, hugged, and one cried. 
</P>
<P>
A sentencing hearing for Moore was scheduled Thursday, and prosecutors said 
they will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said during the four-week trial that Moore was driven by a need for 
money and that she killed Reid to gain part of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michell McEntire said after the verdict that Moore's strong 
character had been used against her in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is also charged with murder in the poisoning of her first husband, James 
Taylor, in 1973, and with assault for allegedly trying to kill her estranged 
husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore, after their honeymoon last year. 
</P>
<P>
No trial dates have been set on those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Officials exhumed five bodies while investigating the case, including those of 
Moore's father. They found arsenic in his remains, but she was not charged in 
connection with his death.

Albania's Communist parliament passed an election law allowing secret ballots 
and a choice of candidates and ordered a sweeping revision of the constitution, 
the official ATA news agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said both issues were approved unanimously at a meeting of the People's 
Assembly in the capital, Tirana, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions mark a further step on a cautious road to reform in Albania, 
Europe's last orthodox Communist state. They were adopted a week before a 
summit meeting in Paris of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE), at which Tirana is bidding for full membership. 
</P>
<P>
The new election law, aimed at elections to the People's Assembly next 
February, stops short of legalizing opposition political parties.

A gunman who fired two shots during a Revolution Day parade on Red Square last

After pulling a double-barreled hunting rifle from under his coat, the gunman 
began to take aim at the Lenin Mausoleum, where President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and other leaders were standing, Sgt. Andrei Mylnikov said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was about three meters (3.3 yards) from me. I ran up to him and, grabbing 
the hunting gun barrel with both hands, sharply raised it upward," Tass news 
agency quoted him as saying. No one was injured in the shooting, and officials 
at the time said the gunman's intention was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Alexander Shmonov, 38, was arrested and is now being held by the 
KGB security police. He has been charged with attempted terrorism and, if 
convicted, could face the death sentence.

Retail sales inched up 0.1% in October, fueled for the third straight month by 
the high cost of gasoline, the government said today. Excluding gasoline, sales 
fell 0.1% amid continuing signs of fading consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $152.3 
billion, up from $152.1 billion in September. 
</P>
<P>
The revised 1.3% gain in September was a bit stronger than the 1.1% increase 
originally reported. But excluding the gasoline impact, sales were up only 0.9% 
that month. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts now believe that the U.S. economy is in a recession that could be 
intensified by a drop in personal consumption. Retail sales represent about 
half of all consumer spending, which itself accounts for two-thirds of the 
nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The department said retail sales since August have been artificially inflated 
by gasoline prices that surged after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and 
disrupted world petroleum markets -- not by increased sales volume. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say consumers have become cautious in their spending in recent months 
after fears of war in the Persian Gulf added to their anxiety over the 
weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a New York business research organization, reported that 
consumer confidence in the economy plunged in October to the lowest level since 
the 1981-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at department stores, a key barometer of consumer sentiment, were off 
0.6% after falling 1.1% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales, which have been choppy through much of the year, slowed to a 
0.7% gain from a 2.9% advance the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the automobile category, sales were unchanged from the previous 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items expected to last 
more than three years, were up 0.7% after a 1.4% increase in September. 
</P>
<P>
Besides autos, other components of the durable category were mixed. Sales of 
furniture and other home furnishings fell 0.3%, while building materials jumped 
1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods, which include food and gasoline, slipped 0.2% after a 1.2% 
gain a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a 1.6% increase in drugstore sales, all other categories dropped -- 
grocery stores down 0.5%, clothing stores down 1% and restaurants and bars off 
0.3%.

More foreign companies have withdrawn from South Korea in the first nine months 
of this year than in either of the last two years, a government report said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It attributed the development to the nation's economic slowdown and unfavorable 
labor and management conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry report said 30 foreign firms withdrew in the first nine 
months this year. The report said 28 foreign investors left South Korea in 1989 
and 19 left in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreign companies leaving South Korea have sought business in the 
European Community and East European countries, the report said.

British Airways PLC said today its second-quarter profit rose 9.4%, but its 
chairman warned that a profit in the second half is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months ended Sept. 30, after-tax profits for Britain's biggest 
airline came to 116 million pounds, or $217 million, compared to 106 million 
pounds in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 4.6% to 1.4 billion pounds, or $2.6 billion, from 1.35 billion 
pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months, after-tax profit jumped 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Lord King said the airline is "unlikely to show a profit" in the 
second half because of higher fuel costs that have resulted from the Persian 
Gulf crisis. He said fare increases won't recoup the extra costs associated 
with fuel hikes and expected lower traffic growth.

The average physician in the United States earned $155,800 last year, an 
increase of 7.7% from the year before, the American Medical Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation cut the actual increase to about 2.7%, the group said in its annual 
report on income statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of all doctors in the country earned less than $85,000 
during 1989, the group said, and 25% of all physicians in general practice, 
family practice or pediatrics made less than $63,000.

South Korea exported 249,000 motor vehicles between January and October, down 
9.5% from a year ago, the Korea Automobile Manufacturing Assn. reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports was attributed to price competition and sluggish demand 
in the United States, which is Korea's biggest export market. 
</P>
<P>
The association said the number of Korean-made vehicles sold on the domestic 
market in the first 10 months of this year jumped 24.8% to 768,000 from a year 
ago. Total sales rose to 748,000 cars, up 9.4% from a year ago, and 269,000 
commercial vehicles, up 29.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Hyundai Motor Co. topped the list of Korean auto makers by 
marketing 530,000 vehicles at home and abroad in the 10 months, up 7% from a 
year ago. It was followed by Kia Motors Corp. with 313,000 motor vehicles, up 
24.7%, and Daewoo Motor Co. with 135,000 vehicles, up 15.4%.

The men's and women's tennis tours today announced a joint drug-testing policy 
and adopted several identical regulations in their Codes of Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The men's Assn. of Tennis Professionals started drug testing in 1987, while the 
Women's Tennis Assn. began a program last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we have sharpened the focus of both our drug-testing programs by making 
them essentially the same," said Mark Miles, ATP Tour's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The ATP tour does not disclose results of its random drug-testing program. 
Rules call for an automatic nine-month suspension for performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The suspensions would have to be made public, according to ATP rules. There 
have been no such suspensions since the men's tour began drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
The two tours also agreed on some on-court practices -- that the time allowed 
between points shall not exceed 25 seconds and that there will be 90 seconds 
for changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called three-step Penalty Schedule (warning, point, default) will be 
used for on-court code violations. Time violations are not part of the Penalty 
Schedule.

Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors says his team is aiming for a berth in the Sugar 
Bowl, and he has not discussed with his players the possibility of playing in 
the controversy-ridden Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked Volunteers play No. 15 Mississippi on Saturday, and a loss 
would probably end Tennessee's hopes for a Southeastern Conference championship 
and a trip to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has surrounded the Fiesta Bowl because of some teams' reluctance to 
play in a state that rejected a holiday in memory of slain civil rights leader 
Martin Luther King Jr. Majors said he has not talked about that with his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our desire to try our best to play our way into the Sugar Bowl," he 
said. ". . . That's all I've talked to the players about. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise I will not have anything else to add about any other arrangements, 
and will not address that issue personally unless things change Saturday."

Denver Broncos tackle Gerald Perry is under investigation for third-degree 
sexual assault charges, the fifth time he has been named in a criminal case in 
nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Police Department spokeswoman Linda Barrow said police officers removed 
Perry from a woman's home about 3 a.m. Tuesday at the woman's request. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the woman called police and told them the 6-6, 305-pound tackle made 
unwanted sexual advances, Barrow said. No weapons were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Perry has not been arrested, Barrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Police Division Chief Ron Sloan said, "There is some question as to how 
the actual contact came to be. That's under investigation. That's an integral 
part of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Broncos Coach Dan Reeves would not speculate on Perry's future with the team, 
but said he was aware of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things happening, but until that investigation has been done, I 
don't know a heck of a lot about what's going to happen," he said. "Certainly 
I'm disappointed that anything is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Since December, 1988, Perry has been convicted twice of soliciting a 
prostitute, was acquitted of a rape charge and was arrested on a third-degree 
assault for hitting a Denver man at a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Perry is scheduled for trial in the bar fight case in December. He was 
undergoing treatment for alcoholism at an Arizona rehabilitation center when 
the charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Perry served 15 days in jail for the second solicitation offense.

AUDREY HEPBURN BRINGS RAY OF HOPE TO VIETNAM

<P>
Audrey Hepburn traveled to a remote, mountainous area of Vietnam this month to 
raise funds for poor children and help forge a kinder image of this isolated 
communist country. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn, who has worked since 1988 as a "goodwill ambassador" for UNICEF, said 
she wanted to remind people in the West that Vietnam was a country, not just a 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to give a much more accessible, human picture of Vietnam than 
just the Vietnam War. It's a ghost that has to be laid" to rest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn flew in a Vietnamese helicopter to the remote northeastern village of 
Mo Vang in Hoang Lien Son province near the Chinese border early this month to 
visit ethnic minorities who are among Vietnam's poorest people. 
</P>
<P>
She stopped at a simple wooden health clinic tucked in among rugged green 
mountains. The clinic was staffed by Vietnamese health workers trained and 
equipped by UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
They test people for malaria and treat others for goiter, an enlargement of the 
thyroid gland caused by iodine deficiency that produces a large swelling in the 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
Ten million of Vietnam's 65 million people live in mountainous areas. The 
iodine deficiency disorder affects 35% of highland people because iodine is 
lacking in the soil, plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder causes cretinism or mental retardation among 2% of the 2 million 
people in the most remote mountain areas. 
</P>
<P>
Few Westerners get to visit Vietnam's far-flung ethnic minority areas. At one 
point, village women in a thatched house on stilts swarmed around Hepburn to 
dress her in a colorful skirt and blouse of the Tay minority. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of chattering village women then bustled along behind the sprightly 
61-year-old actress. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the people in Mo Vang suffer from goiter, one of the highest 
rates in the country, a UNICEF officer said. Several elderly retarded people, 
stricken by the disorder, sat staring from their thatched huts. 
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF officer, Jean Dricot, said malaria was the main killer of children 
and pregnant women in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn made a brief reference to a U.S. trade embargo that has denied Vietnam 
bilateral American trade and aid, as well as funds from international lending 
bodies and technology and investment from many Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the business of politics. I'm in the business of children," she 
said. "This country needs not just to be opened up (from sanctions), but 
knowledge-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, she said, "this generation of children will go down hill."

The Nashville Network's program "Nashville Now" sent Hall to the tiny community 
just south of Jackson after receiving a letter from resident Rose Beazley. 
</P>

"I just told 'Nashville Now' that a lot of our men were leaving," Beazley said, 
adding that many of the 127 soldiers, including her brother-in-law, had to 
leave young children behind. 
</P>
<P>
Hall hosted an eight-minute segment about Crystal Springs, which was broadcast 
nationally Monday on the cable network. Hundreds of people crowded into 
downtown, some waving signs and shouting messages to their soldiers.

Former Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver paid $500 to retrieve a set of 
documents he says "will tell the story that hasn't been told," about the 
now-defunct militant group. 
</P>
<P>
Cartons of Cleaver's books, files and other belongings were nearly sold by the 
AAAAA Rent-A-Space company last month for $25. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaver, 55, owed more than $900 in overdue rental fees. 
</P>
<P>
But the documents were returned to Cleaver on Monday after he agreed to pay the 
storage company $500. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most comprehensive collection in private hands of what the Black 
Panther Party was up to," Cleaver said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will tell the story that hasn't been told . . . and will be a vindication 
of a lot of slander and lies that have been told about me personally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaver, one of the founders of the Oakland-based Black Panthers in 1966, said 
the items include photographs, papers and pamphlets documenting the group's 
activities between 1966 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaver said he will donate them to the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.

Paul McCartney's birth certificate is for sale and could fetch $20,000, the 
auctioneer says. 
</P>
<P>
Auction house owner Ray Simpson said Tuesday he examined the paper, stamps and 
certification language and concluded it's the real thing. The birth certificate 
was sold to an American investor by the former Beatle's stepmother, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt about it at all. It is absolutely unconditionally guaranteed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The certificate shows that on June 18, 1942, at 107 Rice Lane, James Paul 
McCartney was born to James McCartney, a "centre lathe turner (aircraft 
factory)," and Mary Patricia McCartney of 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool.
