SALVADOR CIVILIANS FLEE AS REBEL POSITIONS ARE STRAFED

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of civilians waving white flags fled their embattled neighborhoods 
Tuesday as the armed forces declared an around-the-clock curfew in one-third of 
metropolitan San Salvador and stepped up aerial strafing of guerrilla 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Panic erupted in several neighborhoods as word spread that the army was 
preparing to move against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels 
who had staked out positions in public housing complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The army fired rockets at hills on the northern edge of the capital on the 
fourth day of the rebels' biggest urban offensive in 10 years of war. The 
fighting showed no sign of abating. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian and military casualties continued to rise. Hospitals and forensic 
officials reported at least 180 dead and 680 wounded. The army and guerrillas 
put the toll higher. 
</P>
<P>
In a communique read over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, rebel commanders 
vowed to push the offensive "to its ultimate consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Having enforced a nationwide traffic ban for two days, the rebels called a 
general strike and threatened any businesses that oblige their employees to 
work. They also urged supporters to form "popular governments" in territory 
that they claim to control in eight of the country's 14 provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, the country has been under a state of siege that suspends 
constitutional guarantees and gives the government control over all licensed 
news broadcasts. A nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew is in force. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces expanded the curfew Tuesday in seven densely populated 
neighborhoods on the northern and eastern edges of the capital -- Ilopango, 
Soyapango, Santa Lucia, Mejicanos, Zacamil, Ayutuxtepeque and Ciudad Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were ordered to stay off the streets at all hours, a measure that 
effectively made those poor and working-class areas free-fire zones. The area 
is home to about half of San Salvador's 2.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The army's action, coupled with reports of aerial strafing, drew cries of alarm 
from international human rights organizations. Americas Watch, a New York-based 
group, urged U.S. Ambassador William Walker to support its call that the army 
refrain from "indiscriminate attacks" that threaten civilian life. It urged the 
guerrillas to take similar precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Army and government officials charged that the rebels are using civilians as 
shields and said the military is taking precautions to avoid civilian 
casualties. Army spokesman Col. Raul Arturo Lopez said the curfew "allows us to 
carry out our actions with as little risk as possible" to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded curfew was announced early Tuesday. Men and women, many of whom 
have gone for days without food, ran out of their neighborhoods carrying 
babies, dogs and paper bags with a few meager belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us to get out," cried 15-year-old Cristina Hernandez in the northern 
neighborhood of Zacamil. "The army is coming." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any food," shouted an elderly woman carrying her parakeet. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Soyapango, men caught away from home stood helplessly on the roadside 
watching a C-47 gunship pour fire on communities where their families were 
stranded. In the distance, a spotter plane fired rockets at suspected rebel 
positions on the slope of San Jacinto volcano, just beyond a populated area. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any information about my family in four days," said Carlos 
Lareynaga, 45, a resident of Norwalk, Calif., who was traveling from San 
Salvador to Soyapango. "I have four children, my wife and a grandson there. I 
came to see my children for the first time since I left five years ago. . . . I 
never imagined the situation would be so delicate." 
</P>
<P>
President Alfredo Cristiani, in his first news conference since the offensive 
began, denied that the rebels hold any territory and said their assault has not 
threatened his right-wing government. But a Western diplomat said the 
guerrillas have the military initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The guerrillas are clearly on the offensive," he said. "The army's been held 
at bay for 60 hours. . . . The curfew means they (the army) don't have 
control." 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize their presence and explain their offensive, four rebel commanders 
held an hourlong press conference in an apartment building in Zacamil. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a series of victories in the countryside, but this is history," said 
a rebel who goes by the name of Amilcar. "We're in the city because it's the 
heart of the enemy. This is the economic, political and military heart." 
</P>
<P>
The rebel commanders said they had many combatants fighting for the first time 
in this offensive. They claimed they have enough firepower and stamina to 
continue indefinitely.

NAVY SUSPENDS OPERATIONS TO REVIEW SAFETY 
</P>

<P>
The Navy, responding to an eerie succession of accidents, halted the normal 
operation of all its ships, aircraft and shore-based units Tuesday to launch an 
unprecedented three-day review of the service's safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. 
Carlisle A. H. Trost ordered the service-wide "safety stand-down" hours after 
an electrical fire aboard the Navy helicopter carrier Inchon injured 31 people. 
The ship was in a Norfolk, Va., shipyard for routine repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the safety message, an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, conducting 
routine air combat training out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, went 
down in the Atlantic Ocean 60 miles northwest of Key West, Fla. The two-man 
crew was plucked from the water by a Navy helicopter, but the aircraft was 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's order follows a string of at least 10 significant accidents involving 
Navy forces that have occurred since October, including a plane crashing into 
an apartment complex, a jet dropping a bomb on a cruiser and last weekend's 
accidental bombing of a California campsite. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has suffered 102 fatalities in accidents so far this year. It 
considers all the incidents unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new order, all Navy units will suspend their normal flying and 
sailing schedules for two days, beginning sometime in the next three days. The 
interruption in routine training is designed to focus sailors' attention on the 
perils they face and to review and revise the safety measures that are in place 
to minimize those dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"The obligation we have to bring every sailor home safely and husband the 
scarce resource of combat readiness dictates a hard look at all levels and at 
every detail," Trost wrote in his message to the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Trost ordered skippers, squadron leaders and base commanders to "leave no stone 
unturned to ensure that safety of operations is foremost in the minds of all 
hands, from the deck plate to the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 72-hour period, Trost is to receive reports detailing the 
lessons learned during the safety reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no common thread" to the recent string of mishaps, Trost told 
reporters. But he acknowledged that "we've had this recent rash of accidents, 
which makes me say: 'Is something happening; are people getting careless?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Navy fatalities this year include 47 sailors killed aboard the battleship 
Iowa on April 19 when the turret of a 16-inch gun exploded. In 1988, a total of 
63 fatalities occurred during Navy operations and training, Navy spokesman Lt. 
Frank Thorp said. 
</P>
<P>
This year so far, 67 major accidents have occurred aboard ships, submarines and 
in aircraft. Thorp noted that the total is still below the Navy's record low of 
69 major accidents last year. 
</P>
<P>
One former Navy officer warned that the recent string of accidents may be a 
consequence of the Navy's long-term budget strategy, which has emphasized 
shipbuilding and equipment modernization while giving lower priority to 
personnel and training budgets. As the size of the fleet has grown, increases 
in manpower and training budgets have not kept up, said retired Rear Adm. 
Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the Washington-based Center for Defense 
Information. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, sailors must work harder and under tight budgets to man a much 
larger fleet, Carroll said. As those pressures increase, he said, accidents can 
happen more readily. 
</P>
<P>
"These accidents might be tied together by the fact that you are pushing people 
too hard for too long and not putting equivalent increases into the readiness 
effort," Carroll said. "This might be the forward edge of a trend" that could 
continue as budget reductions cut deeply into personnel and readiness spending. 
</P>
<P>
The safety review comes as the military services brace for deep budget cuts 
likely to be ordered by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an arcane loophole in that law, the Navy's "operations and 
maintenance" budget, which pays for steaming and flying hours, would not be 
cut. But Adm. Leon A. Edney, vice chief of naval operations, said last week 
that the law would force the Navy to cut 76,500 active-duty sailors from its 
rolls and reduce its reserve forces by 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
Among the string of accidents since October: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A jet accidentally dropped bombs outside a practice bombing range in 
California over the weekend, but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A reserve attack jet last Thursday crashed into an apartment complex in 
Atlanta, killing two people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Sunday, the U.S. destroyer Kinkaid collided with a merchant ship in the 
Strait of Malacca off the coast of Malaysia. One sailor died and four were 
injured on the Kinkaid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Navy F/A-18 fighter jet from the aircraft carrier Midway on Oct. 30 
dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile cruiser Reeves in the Indian 
Ocean, blowing a 5-foot hole in the ship's bow and injuring five sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Oct. 29, a jet trainer crashed on the flight deck of the aircraft 
carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. Five people, including the pilot, died 
and 19 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four sailors have been swept overboard in recent weeks, three from the 
aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Atlantic and one from the carrier 
Carl Vinson in the Pacific. Two were rescued, but one was missing in the 
Atlantic and one in the Pacific, presumably drowned. 
</P>
<P>
The grounding and review can begin as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, aircraft will be grounded starting 
at 7 a.m. Thursday for 48 hours. The airfield, which normally roars with 350 
takeoffs each day, will be silent as pilots and maintenance crews view safety 
tapes and review their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Miramar usually has 8-hour safety reviews four times a year, said Chief Bobbie 
Carleton, Miramar spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"The most obvious thing, because this is a longer period of time, this is going 
to be much more intense and will involve the officers, enlisted personnel, 
civilians and families," Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of ships began implementing the safety stand-down hours after orders 
were received Tuesday, said Cmdr. David Dillon, a Pacific Fleet spokesman. For 
the ships stationed in San Diego, commanding officers are being told that they 
can take more than the required 48 hours to review safety procedures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hit safety hard because we've had so many things happen in the last 
three weeks," Dillon said. "We're adopting a look-before-you-leap approach." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the goal will be heightening sailors' attention to details, said Capt. 
Charlie Robinson, a safety officer for Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet. "When you 
look at each individual mishap, it's obviously come from inattention. Let's get 
everybody's attention." 
</P>
<P>
The safety reviews will affect only those Marines who are stationed aboard Navy 
ships, said Lt. Patrick Gibbons, spokesman for Camp Pendleton. There are now 
about 1,500 Marines aboard ships in the Western Pacific, plus Marine 
detachments on aircraft carriers, submarines and battleships. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Navy personnel expressed dismay over the recent chain of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear about these accidents, you realize it could happen to you. This 
brings it home," said Petty Officer Brian Bell, an aircraft technician. "You 
just hope you don't make a mistake yourself. But it's a busy place; you have to 
be careful, and you hope that everyone is paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the string of recent accidents may have hurt recruiting, 
officials recently called about 75 recruiters in the Western portion of the 
nation, said Lt. Gene Eliott, a spokesman for Navy Recruiting Area 8, a 
10-state area that includes California. None of the recruiters reported 
receiving calls from concerned applicants or their parents. Eliott said he did 
not expect to see a decline, but added, "It's too soon to tell."

COUNCIL OKS RUSH-HOUR BAN ON MOST LARGE TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved Mayor Tom Bradley's plan to cut traffic 
congestion and air pollution by banning 70% of large trucks from city streets 
during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, the first in the nation, is expected to be used by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District as a model for other communities in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ban will not apply to freeways, it is expected to reduce by 50% 
the number of large trucks traveling on the freeways during rush hours because 
they will not be permitted to use city streets to enter or exit. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Tuesday, Bradley, who is in Europe, said he was 
"delighted" by passage of the proposal and said it moves Los Angeles a step 
closer to being the first city in the country to manage truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bicker, Bradley's transportation adviser, said Tuesday it will be at least 
three months before the plan takes effect. "Trucking is crucial to the 
economy," Bicker said, "but unless we manage heavy-duty truck traffic, trucks 
and commuters will find themselves increasingly mired in congestion." He said 
the plan balances the goals of managing growth and ensuring the economic 
well-being of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to do this is not to change the status quo," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. "And the status quo stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Bradley more than a year ago, the measure had been held up for 
months in the council's Transportation Committee as trucking interests lobbied 
heavily against it. Under increasing pressure from Bradley's office as well as 
other council members, Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the committee, sent 
the proposal to the council late last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal emerged from committee with a number of exemptions for special 
interests, including small construction firms and trucks carrying seasonal 
items such as Christmas trees and watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
Bicker said Tuesday an attempt will be made to remove the exemptions before the 
final ordinance is drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
"What we tried to do consistently was never grant exemptions for an industry," 
Bicker said, "but set up rules that would provide across-the-board regulations 
for industries of all types." 
</P>
<P>
Bicker said it was "overwhelmingly the intent of the council to have a 
broad-based plan with no special-interest exemptions," but added, "I think they 
were unaware of the fact that they exempted people who didn't need to be 
exempted." 
</P>
<P>
One exemption, for the grocery industry, was left in Tuesday even though the 
Southern California Grocers Assn. said it did not want any special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize along with elected officials that you can't single out groups for 
exemptions," said Steven Koff, president of the association. "We want to have 
to bite the bullet with everyone else." He said the association supported 
Bradley's position that an appeals situation for hardship cases would be 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the broad outlines of the plan in a unanimous vote 
Tuesday, but it will be at least three months before the city attorney's office 
and the city Department of Transportation work out the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of heavy-duty trucks that regularly use Los Angeles 
streets run from 100,000 to 500,000. Officials say they have not determined how 
many trucks may need to get special permits. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will apply to trucks weighing 26,000 pounds or more, generally 
tractor-trailer rigs and other trucks with three or more axles. Fleet owners 
will be permitted to operate only 30% of their trucks during any "peak period," 
defined as 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Further, they may operate the trucks during peak periods only if the trucks are 
inspected and meet safety standards. At present large numbers of trucks in 
California are unsafe and have not been inspected in years, the mayor's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Exempted trucks will be required to display a placard supplied by the city when 
they are operating during peak periods. Any truck spotted without a placard 
will be sent a ticket by mail so as not to delay traffic by stopping it on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty for operating during peak hours without permission has not yet been 
worked out, but the city plans to charge $60 per year per vehicle to pay the 
costs of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the city will be able to collect the fee is in doubt, however, because 
of a bill passed in the closing hours of the legislative session in Sacramento 
in September. That law appears to bar the city from collecting the fee, so the 
city may enlist the South Coast Air Quality Management District to collect the 
fee instead. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue that remains to be resolved is how to deal with violations of the 
city's noise ordinance that may occur if truckers are forced to make deliveries 
late at night or early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Schumacher, head of the California Truckers Assn., said Tuesday that 
the council action was "a far cry from the passage of a truck ban," and that he 
would not comment on the matter "until I see something in writing." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the exemptions written into the plan, several council members 
indicated Tuesday they will seek to have them removed. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the exemptions are open to whoever screams the loudest," said 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
The special-interest exemptions were inserted by Holden during committee 
hearings after individuals and special-interest groups complained that their 
businesses would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TRUCK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-duty trucks, those weighing 26,000 pounds or more, will not be permitted 
on city streets from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. weekdays unless they have 
special permission from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet operators may obtain permission to operate up to 30% of their trucks 
during peak periods if their fleets meet safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
A fee of as much as $60 a truck will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
An appeals board will be set up to deal with hardship cases. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who experience noise or other problems related to late-night or early 
morning deliveries may file a complaint with the appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
Certain trucks may be exempt from the ban, including produce and grocery 
trucks, owners of small fleets of trucks, trucks carrying seasonal deliveries, 
utility repair trucks and trucks hauling hazardous materials. Liquor trucks, 
already regulated by state law, may also be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
A rapid deployment force consisting of helicopters and heavy-duty tow trucks 
would be stationed throughout the city to quickly clear trucks involved in 
accidents from major arteries.

UCSD TO STUDY TIE BETWEEN HORMONES, HEART DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego School of Medicine is taking part in a national study to determine 
if commonly used postmenopausal hormone therapies can reduce a woman's risk of 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The program could have "a significant impact on the health care of millions of 
women," Dr. Robert Langer, director of the UCSD study, said. About 250,000 
women die each year of heart disease, which Langer said is the leading cause of 
death in women older than 50. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial, funded by 
the National Institutes of Health, will involve about 840 postmenopausal women 
ages 45 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to UCSD, trials will be conducted at UCLA, Stanford University, 
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the University of Texas, the University 
of Iowa and George Washington University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the seven participating clinics will enroll about 120 participants, 
according to Dr. Bradley Wells, a professor at the Bowman Gray School of 
Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., which will 
coordinate the study results. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will use television commercials featuring cast members of the NBC 
sitcom "Golden Girls" to attract participants, according to Dr. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Connor, a UCSD professor who served as chairwoman of the committee that 
designed the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to address "many unanswered questions" about 
estrogen-replacement therapies that many postmenopausal women regularly 
receive, Barrett-Connor said Friday. Although researchers suspect that some 
replacement hormones reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease, studies 
also have indicated that "therapy carries risks as well as benefits," 
Barrett-Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Menopause occurs when menstrual periods end and the ovaries stop producing 
estrogen and progesterone, hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle and 
fertility. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of postmenopausal women experience symptoms related to hormonal 
changes. Many women suffer hot flashes, a condition that, although 
uncomfortable, is generally not considered to be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
But, for a significant number of women, the hormonal changes cause serious 
medical conditions, including thinning of vaginal and bladder tissues and 
osteoporosis, the thinning of bones. 
</P>
<P>
While both men and women suffer from osteoporosis, the condition is accelerated 
by menopause. Menopause also increases the risk of heart attack among women in 
their mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, as many as 30% of women experiencing menopause are believed to be 
receiving some sort of hormone-replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Women who participate in the trial will receive a placebo or one of four 
different replacement hormones that are believed to reduce the risk of heart 
disease. The trial also will study suspected links between those replacement 
hormones and a wide range of medical conditions, including osteoporosis, 
diabetes and breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The study will "test the effects of various hormone combinations on cholesterol 
and other blood factors and will help us define the best hormone combination 
for postmenopausal women," Langer said. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-year trial, participants will receive free medical 
examinations, including mammograms, Pap tests, periodic blood-pressure tests, 
electrocardiograms and cholesterol and blood sugar measurements. UCSD 
researchers also will use a special machine to measure bone density. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is seeking healthy volunteers from the ages of 45 to 64 who underwent a 
natural or surgical menopause within the past 10 years. In addition to taking 
hormones, participants will undergo 14 checkups at the university's Clinical 
Research Center in La Jolla during the three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Early results from the clinical trials will not be available until at least 
1994, Wells said. The first participants "will be enrolled around Dec. 1, and 
recruitment will continue for at least a year after that," Wells said. "The 
last participants won't be enrolled until the end of January 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Women interested in taking part in the study are asked to contact the Clinical 
Research Laboratory at 619-534-7150.

DELAY EXPECTED IN AUTO POLICY PRICING SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>

Doubts arose Tuesday over whether Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie can 
meet her goal of promulgating new regulations for the pricing of auto insurance 
by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
One of the members of a three-member panel appointed by Gillespie to seek 
compromise solutions for implementing provisions of Proposition 103 said it may 
take to the end of January to analyze data needed to make her decision. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer member of the panel of actuarial experts said that while insurers 
have become cooperative in providing computerized data on which to base a new 
pricing system, there must be enough time to fully evaluate its effects. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, said J. Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance Consumer 
Organization, there could be unpleasant surprises for millions of policyholders 
when the principles of the new system are put into practice. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 implementation has been plagued by months of delays, but Hunter 
said the actuaries are reluctant to rush just to meet the latest deadline and 
want complete computer analysis of their proposed rate-setting formula before 
finally recommending it. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 states that a driver's safety record, the number of miles 
driven annually and the number of years of driving experience should be the 
most important factors in setting insurance rates instead of the home address 
of the driver, as has been the case. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie has stated repeatedly that such a change could result in premium 
increases for 70% of the state's 18 million drivers and decreases for only the 
30% concentrated in the most heavily congested urban areas. For months, she has 
delayed promulgating regulations while she sought a compromise interpretation 
of Proposition 103 that would minimize price adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the commissioner, under pressure to act, set a goal of doing so within 
30 days of the Oct. 30 start of comprehensive Proposition 103 implementation 
hearings and named the actuarial team of experts to help her. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, representatives of a coalition of minority and low-income 
groups have been insisting in testimony at the hearings that the present system 
of neighborhood-based pricing has resulted in racial and class discrimination 
and that Proposition 103's pricing provision should be interpreted as literally 
as possible, even if some policyholders get rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance companies first called last summer for retention of 
neighborhood-based pricing, no matter what Proposition 103 said, but since then 
most have bowed to the initiative and agreed to accept some revision in their 
pricing methods. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter on Tuesday said he was supported in delaying a decision by the two other 
panel members -- Michael Miller representing the insurers, and Deputy State 
Insurance Commissioner Ray Bacon, a top deputy to Gillespie. Miller and Bacon 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter did not say what kind of compromise pricing solution the actuaries are 
contemplating. He lauded Allstate, State Farm and the Insurance Services 
Organization, the insurers that have been providing pricing information to the 
actuarial team, for their help. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's special counsel for the implementation of Proposition 103, Karl 
Rubinstein, responded to Hunter's remarks by saying that while Gillespie is 
eager to proceed, she may prudently decide to wait if all the information is 
not in. 
</P>
<P>
In another insurance development, the staff of Gillespie's state Department of 
Insurance formally recommended that a request by insurers to raise 
assigned-risk auto rates by a statewide average of 112.3% be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The staff said such an increase could result in many drivers, unable to afford 
insurance, illegally becoming uninsured. The staff members said the companies 
that run the assigned-risk system -- under which drivers who cannot buy auto 
coverage in the regular market are assigned to various companies in proportion 
to their share of the business -- should propose less costly reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The staff recommendation is subject to approval by Gillespie, who has not taken 
a position.

A state policy that allows the use of state prison inmates for road maintenance 
has been attacked by the head of a union that represents thousands of Caltrans 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
William A. Biggs, president of the Alliance of Trades and Maintenance, said the 
program endangers public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Biggs added, "These inmates are being pushed on us by (the Department of) 
Corrections with virtually no thought given to our safety or the safety of the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The union represents about 5,000 Caltrans equipment operators, maintenance 
workers and landscapers. 
</P>
<P>
Biggs said the policy went into effect Nov. 7 on state highways near the remote 
northeastern California community of Susanville and near Baker, a desert town 
on Interstate 15 about 60 miles northeast of Barstow. He said prison work crews 
are scheduled to begin work soon near Desert Center, Indio and Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
But Department of Corrections spokeswoman Christine May said the policy started 
about 45 years ago and the department is required by law to determine which 
inmates are eligible for work on crews that are available to state and local 
agencies for such jobs as cleanup and beautification. 
</P>
<P>
May said most of the crews come from the 38 conservation camps and some of the 
19 prisons. Only minimum security inmates are considered. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the camp crews alone worked 145,247 man-hours for Caltrans, saving 
the taxpayers more than $1 million. May said the inmates consider it a 
privilege to work on the crews because it gives them more responsibility and 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the crews seal cracks, clean culverts, wash 
road signs and the like, "allowing our people more time to get to other work." 
He said the inmates "won't displace any of our permanent employees."

4TH AND 10 FOR FOOTBALL TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: A SUIT IS FILED TO OVERTURN THE BARRING OF THE HUNTINGTON BEACH HIGH 
TEAM FROM THE PLAYOFFS. A PLAYER'S RESIDENCY STATUS TRIGGERED THE 
DISQUALIFICATION.

The decision to bar the winning Huntington Beach High School Oilers football 
team from championship playoffs this weekend has sparked a lawsuit that 
followed a boycott of classes and a march of 1,500 students, teachers and 
parents who stopped traffic on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a team member whose residency status resulted in the team being 
declared ineligible arrived from Baltimore and asserted that her son is a bona 
fide resident of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Roman, 44, said she will join her son, David Roman, 17, and the 
Huntington Beach High Football Boosters in a court challenge today in Santa Ana 
over the ruling by the California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The CIF on Saturday declared her son ineligible because the starting right 
tackle was not living in Huntington Beach with a parent or legal guardian in 
accordance with federation rules. The CIF then barred the Oilers from the 
playoffs and had the team's 8-2 season record nullified. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which triggered weekend protests by students and parents, 
prompted a three-hour boycott of classes Monday. About 1,500 students, parents 
and teachers marched on Adams Avenue toward City Hall, stopping traffic before 
police turned them back. 
</P>
<P>
David Roman, who transferred from Maryland, has lived in Huntington Beach since 
enrolling in school Aug. 16. He has lived with his 24-year-old brother, Tony, 
while his mother remained in Maryland to sell their old home. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Gary Ernst said school administrators failed to check his 
eligibility, assuming that his mother had already moved to the city. The 
omission was discovered when David applied last week to the CIF for another 
year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tony Roman of the disqualification: "It's unfair for these kids to have to 
pay for a mistake some adults have made. It is cruel to do this so close to the 
playoffs when their hopes are high." 
</P>
<P>
The club's attorney, James Baze, on Tuesday asked a Superior Court judge for a 
temporary order blocking the CIF from holding the playoffs this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We are playing to win," said booster club president Remo Bellamy. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's too late to get into the playoffs, we want the courts to restore our 
record. The kids must have their dignity back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CIF Commissioner Stanley Thomas insisted that the federation would not reverse 
its decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention to change our decision," Thomas said. "If a judge says 
so, then that's something else. It's a tragedy, but we have to stick to the 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who play in the Sunset League, lost eight of 10 games last year, so 
this year's winning season was a celebrated turnaround for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Pascoe called David's ineligibility an innocent error. 
</P>
<P>
He said he tried to find solace in knowing that the team's victories this year 
really happened, contrary to what it now says in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we won eight ballgames, and the kids should be really proud of that," 
he said.

PUC STAFF URGES $500-MILLION CUT IN PAC BELL BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell customers could save as much as $500 million on local telephone 
service next year under a recommendation by the California Public Utilities 
Commission staff. The proposal, made public Tuesday, would trim the typical 
residential phone bill of $26 a month by $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended cut is much more drastic than the $135-million reduction 
proposed by Pacific Bell last month. The five-member commission is expected to 
order a cut somewhere between the two figures next month. The new rates would 
take effect on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the trim is especially important because a new system for setting 
rates is scheduled to begin Jan. 1. In each succeeding year, annual revenues 
for both Pacific Bell and GTE California -- the state's two largest local phone 
companies -- will increase or decrease according to a formula coupling 
increased costs of living and savings from improved efficiency. So the PUC 
decision will set the base from which future changes will be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
"Because this will establish the base (for the new regulatory procedure), 
ratepayers will be feeling the effects in the years to come," said Terry 
Murray, director of the PUC's division of ratepayer advocacy, which recommended 
the revenue cut. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff has no significant differences with GTE California, which 
proposed that its revenue be increased by about $31 million next year, said 
William D. Thompson, the PUC advocacy division's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the PUC set company costs then added a profit to establish the 
annual revenue to be collected in telephone prices. The new system makes annual 
price adjustments automatic, gives Pacific Bell and GTE a chance to earn more 
than they presently do and caps prices of some optional services while allowing 
the companies to lower them if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, prices will be set to allow an 11.5% profit margin next 
year, but the companies can earn up to 13% without penalty if they can trim 
operating costs. Beyond 13%, however, earnings must be shared equally with 
customers, and if profits top 16.5%, excess earnings must be refunded. On the 
other hand, if profit margins fall below 8.25%, the companies can petition the 
commission for relief. 
</P>
<P>
The commission adopted this incentive-based regulatory framework last month. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokesman Lou Saviano said the company is "disappointed but not 
surprised" by the magnitude of the recommended cuts. Saviano acknowledged that 
company profit margins now run more than 13%, exceeding the current authorized 
limit of 11.34%. These excess earnings -- whatever the commission determines 
them to be -- will be returned next year as credits on monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell's revenue in California totaled about $7 billion last year.

PENTAGON DISCLOSES ISRAEL NUCLEAR MISSILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Pentagon report, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and made 
public on the eve of a crucial visit to the White House by Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, disclosed Tuesday that Israel has nuclear and chemical 
warheads for its Jericho I missile. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the report is certain to increase pressure on Shamir when he 
meets President Bush today to talk about a U.S. plan to revive the stalled 
Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon document lists "nuclear, chemical or HE (high explosive)" as the 
warheads for the tactical ballistic missile, which has been in the Israeli 
arsenal for more than 20 years. The Jericho I reportedly has a range of about 
400 miles. A newer version has a range of about 900 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been speculation for years that Israel has both nuclear and 
chemical armaments, the Israeli government has steadfastly refused to discuss 
the matter. The U.S. government, Israel's closest ally, also had declined to 
confirm the reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private organization with a generally 
liberal outlook, obtained the Defense Intelligence Agency report titled 
"Surface-to-Surface Missile Systems Handbook -- Free World" under the Freedom 
of Information Act. Five heavily censored pages were made available to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy, said of the report: "I can 
only reiterate our traditional position which says that the state of Israel 
will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who arrived in Washington on his 74th birthday Tuesday, hopes to 
persuade Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to give his government 
certain assurances regarding proposed U.S.-mediated talks with the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In return for participating in the talks, Israel wants an understanding that it 
will not be expected to discuss anything but its plan for West Bank and Gaza 
Strip elections and will not be asked to negotiate with Palestinians who do not 
live in Israeli-occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's policy-making inner cabinet accepted "in principle" Baker's five-point 
plan for Israeli-Palestinian dialogue earlier this month, but it conditioned 
its endorsement on U.S. acceptance of Israeli conditions expected to make the 
plan unacceptable to the Arab world. Baker said last week he had told Israel 
the conditions were unacceptable before the Cabinet voted, but he has refrained 
from rejecting the proposals out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said last week he was awaiting an official reaction from 
Egypt, which is acting as surrogate for the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
to his five-point peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has sent unmistakable signals of its annoyance with Shamir's 
position. Although the prime minister announced long ago that he planned to 
make a "private" visit to the United States, the White House put off until last 
week an announcement that Bush would agree to a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underline the message, Bush met Tuesday with Tunisian President Zine 
Abidine ben Ali, who was also in Washington on an unofficial trip. The White 
House said later that the Tunisian leader was invited to make a state visit to 
the United States in May. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also was greeted by harsh criticism from some U.S. Jews. Although 
mainline Jewish groups repeated their support for Israel and Shamir, the Jewish 
Peace Lobby released an open letter signed by more than 200 American rabbis 
urging Shamir to agree to a land-for-peace deal that would establish a 
Palestinian homeland in return for Arab approval of a peace treaty with Israel.

AFL-CIO FINALLY GETS TO HONOR WALESA

<P>
Poland's Lech Walesa on Tuesday finally got to take up the invitation he 
received eight years ago to address the American labor movement, and -- judging 
by his tear-streaked smile -- how sweet it was. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional moment -- shared by an overflow crowd of 1,100 AFL-CIO delegates 
who interrupted with applause about 29 times -- would have strained a seasoned 
diplomat, let alone the spiritual father of Eastern Europe's democratic 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But Walesa, wearing a slightly rumpled suit and a wide knit tie, clearly felt 
he was in his element. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I am here, in the United States, as a trade unionist," he shouted to an 
already enraptured crowd that greeted his arrival with a 13-minute standing 
ovation and waved placards in red and white, the colors of the Solidarity labor 
movement he leads. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, after closing with a call, in Polish, for "Solidarity forever" -- a 
traditional slogan used by labor unions throughout the world -- he added, in 
English: "Union -- Yes!" -- the AFL-CIO's new theme. Predictably, it brought 
down the house. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was a highlight of Walesa's historic first visit to the United 
States, which began Monday night and will take him to New York, Chicago and 
Philadelphia. The trip, which included a private dinner with President Bush on 
Tuesday night, has taken on added significance because it comes amid an 
extraordinary series of reforms sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, meanwhile, voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a $738-million aid 
package for Poland and Hungary. The measure contains $283 million more than the 
Bush Administration sought to help Poland and Hungary stabilize and reform 
their economies. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic reforms in East Germany and initial signs of a similar political 
thaw in Czechoslovakia injected new impetus into Democratic-led efforts to 
increase the aid package to demonstrate U.S. support for the democratization of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While it must be reconciled with a similar House package approved last month, 
the Senate action assured that Poland and Hungary will ultimately receive a 
three-year program of assistance substantially greater than the $455 million 
sought by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
By Walesa's own admission, the AFL-CIO appearance was "a meeting that has been 
a long time in coming." 
</P>
<P>
It was in November, 1981, that Walesa was invited to the United States to 
receive the AFL-CIO's George Meany Human Rights Award, which the organization 
had bestowed on the Solidarity union. But, after increased disturbances at home 
sparked partly by Solidarity's protests of the Polish government's policies, 
Warsaw's Communist leaders refused to allow Walesa to leave. The AFL-CIO has 
held the award in abeyance ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after 7 1/2 years of continuing protest and a stunning victory that 
gave Solidarity essential control of the instruments of Poland's government, 
Walesa came to accept the award and to give AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland a 
bear hug of thanks for American labor's support. 
</P>
<P>
But he also brought another message, an appeal for Americans to invest in 
Polish business ventures to help the new Solidarity government move the country 
toward a market-oriented economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like Americans to smooth the way for big business deals with Poland," 
he said. "Our country needs your experience, your knowledge, your modern 
technologies. . . . The world is awaiting your signal." 
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if we fail to convince people that . . . things are changing 
for the better, then this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa is spending three days in the nation's capital. He arrived Monday night 
to receive the Medal of Freedom from President Bush, and today he will become 
only the second foreigner not holding public office at the time to address a 
joint session of Congress. The first was the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824, said 
Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
Then on to New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.

COMMUNISTS IN ITALY WILL RENAME PARTY

Western Europe's largest Communist Party surrendered to changing times Tuesday, 
formally announcing that it will change its name. It also will wave goodby to 
the hammer and sickle. 
</P>
<P>
Achille Occhetto, general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, told the 
56-member party directorate that the name change is part of a plan to forge a 
broad alliance of left-wing political forces in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.5-million-member party has shared power in recent years at city halls in 
every major Italian city but has been an outsider at the national level since 
the 1948 founding of the Italian Republic. And, mired behind dominant Christian 
Democrats, the Communists have been stagnant at the polls in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The party, Italy's second-largest political grouping, has been stridently 
independent of Moscow since the era of Josef Stalin and has been a frequent 
critic of Soviet interventionist foreign policies. Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, widely admired by most Italian Communists, will call on the party 
later this month during a state visit to Italy. He will also see Pope John Paul

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly elected East German prime minister, Hans Modrow, opened talks with 
non-Communist Party leaders Tuesday in an effort to form what he called a 
"genuine coalition government." 
</P>
<P>
He and Communist leader Egon Krenz conferred with the heads of four small 
parties that have suddenly displayed independence after years of serving as 
Communist Party satellites. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, West German officials again offered massive financial aid to East 
Germany -- providing that the government introduces stringent economic and 
political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The East German regime is also considering opening up the Berlin Wall near the 
Brandenburg Gate, East Berlin's best-known monument and symbol, according to 
the official news agency ADN. 
</P>
<P>
But Modrow was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the West German newspaper Bild 
as saying that while the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, it must remain 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
"In our country, there is little criminal activity . . . cases of AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and drugs are virtually unknown. Our 
people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is," Bild 
quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people crossing the Berlin Wall on Tuesday was estimated at 
180,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, West German Red Cross officials reported that the number of 
East German refugees approaching them about returning home has reached 10,000. 
Counseling services for potential returnees have been set up at West German 
relocation camps to advise East Germans whether they will be penalized if they 
go back. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to form a coalition regime, Modrow sought out the leaders of the four 
small parties: the Democratic Farmers' Party, the Christian Democratic Union, 
the Liberal Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
These smaller parties, which in the past rubber-stamped Communist orders, have 
seats in the Parliament and have been increasingly critical of government 
policies and the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Communists occupy 39 of the 43 Cabinet posts, and Modrow is expected to reduce 
the size of the Cabinet as well as make it more of a coalition. ADN gave no 
details of the meeting, and Modrow did not say whether the opposition would 
join his conception of a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Guenter Schabowski, a prominent member of the Politburo, resigned as party 
chief for East Berlin, ADN reported. Political analysts say Schabowski, 
considered to be a leading reform-minded politician, may receive an important 
post in Modrow's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
He earlier had indicated he might surrender the city post because of a heavy 
workload. He remains in the Politburo and as the party's propaganda chief. He 
was replaced as party chief for the capital by Hans Albrecht. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new, non-Communist Speaker of the East German Parliament said he 
will seek to change the first article of the country's constitution, which 
defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. The party has used the 
provision to justify its monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
Guenther Maleuda told a meeting of his Democratic Farmers' Party faction in 
Parliament that the Communist Party is to blame for East Germany's economic, 
social and political problems. 
</P>
<P>
The West German pledge of massive financial aid to help rebuild East Germany's 
economy had been made before and was conditional on political and economic 
reforms that the Communists have so far rejected. 
</P>
<P>
But West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was more specific, offering 
a six-point plan that would include investments and joint ventures, as well as 
revamping the nation's dilapidated communications and transport systems. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann did not specify a figure for the aid and said the plan would be 
useless if East Germany fails to carry out a "thorough change" in its centrally 
directed economy. East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a 
complete free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan, brainchild of U.S. 
Secretary of State George C. Marshall, which sent more than $12 billion in U.S 
aid from 1948-51 to help war-devastated Europe return to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, the rumors that a new border crossing would be punched through 
the Berlin Wall near the historic Brandenburg Gate drew about 200 West 
Berliners to a chilly vigil Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police chiefs from both sides of the wall conferred by phone, and it was 
understood afterward that "nothing will happen tonight," a West Berlin police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if and when it will go down," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ten East German guards stood almost casually atop the wall, gazing down at the 
throngs of West Berliners and reporters, some of whom had staked out their 
spots with pup tents. Television lights cast a bright glow on the 
graffiti-covered western face of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the barricade, floodlights illuminated the gate itself, which came to 
separate the city into Allied and Soviet zones after World War II, also 
severing Berlin's busiest boulevard -- Unter Den Linden. West German police 
kept the crowd about 20 feet back from the wall, which some Berliners danced 
atop last week. 
</P>
<P>
People waited in line to climb the two viewing platforms erected by the West 
years ago to allow tourists a peak over the forbidden wall and the gate behind 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Tamara Jones contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Brandenburg Gate, the site where East Germany is considering creating a new 
opening in the Berlin Wall, has for decades served as a mocking reminder of 
Germany's defeat in World War II. Lying in East Berlin just beyond the wall in 
the heart of the divided city, the monument, topped with a bronze statue of the 
Goddess of Victory in a chariot, was erected in 1788-91 to celebrate military 
victories and was named after the German state that later became Prussia. 
Modeled on the Propylaea, the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens, it was 
severely damaged in World War II and has been completely rebuilt.

President Bush, reacting to the escalating bloodshed in El Salvador, said 
Tuesday that he intends to press Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their 
Malta meeting next month to "stop sending arms into the hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, airing Administration unhappiness over continued arms shipments 
by Soviet allies to Nicaragua and the Salvadoran rebels, is the strongest 
criticism Bush has made of Gorbachev in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also named a 20-member congressional commission, co-chaired by Los Angeles 
Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, to monitor the Nicaraguan election 
process.

HOUSE BARS MILLIONS FOR U.N. FUND BUSH SAYS PAYS FOR FORCED ABORTIONS IN CHINA 
</P>

<P>
After a dramatic seesaw battle, the House on Tuesday voted in effect to prevent 
U.S. payment of $15 million to a U.N. population fund that President Bush has 
accused of financing compulsory abortion in China. 
</P>
<P>
The House avoided a threatened presidential veto of the $14.6-billion foreign 
aid appropriations bill by voting 219 to 203 to bar any government money for 
the U.N. fund unless Bush certifies that it did not support or manage a program 
of "coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization" in China. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the House had voted 244 to 178 to approve funding for the U.N. 
unit. By changing its position, the House provided a victory for Bush. The 
harder line on family planning policy was first instituted by former President 
Ronald Reagan in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote saved Bush from the prospect of vetoing the entire 
appropriations bill, which includes about $600 million in aid for Poland and 
Hungary during the current fiscal year, as well as substantial military and 
economic aid to Israel, Egypt and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive roll call came immediately after the House had voted to go along 
with a Senate-passed provision that earmarked the $15 million for family 
planning services by the United Nations Fund for Population Assistance (FPA) in 
130 poor countries, but banned any payment for abortions or use of any of the 
funds in China. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will go back to the Senate to see whether it will accept the 
amendment requiring presidential certification before funds can be sent to the 
U.N. group -- a requirement that almost guarantees that no funds will go to the 
FPA. Bush has made it clear that he opposes U.S. support for the organization 
because of its past backing for China's severe population control measures. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate explanation for the sudden reversal of 41 votes on the 
issue. Some observers speculated that many House members were anxious to avoid 
a Bush veto of the appropriations bill as they rush to adjourn the 
congressional session before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
During the stormy debate, foes of abortion lined up against abortion rights 
advocates over the issue, although the funds in the bill were earmarked for 
family planning services. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said the U.N. agency contributed significantly to 
China's ability to force women to have abortions or undergo sterilizations 
against their will. "You're on the extreme side if you support coerced 
abortion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents, however, said the U.N. fund was the only global agency providing 
family planning services to the world's poorest countries that were growing the 
fastest and needed assistance to curb their populations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you oppose abortion, how can you oppose family planning?" asked Rep. 
Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). Rep. Jan Meyers (R-Kan.) argued: "Family planning 
saves the lives of women." 
</P>
<P>
In other abortion-related action Tuesday, four Republican women members of the 
House met with Bush to urge him to reconsider his strong stand against 
government payment for abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
The President vetoed the $157-billion appropriations bill for the departments 
of Labor and Health and Human Services because it authorized, for the first 
time in nearly a decade, Medicaid-paid abortions for rape and incest victims. 
Although the House failed to override the veto, a clear majority of 231 members 
voted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The four women, who voted against Bush on the issue, suggested possible 
compromise language that would allow government payment for abortions in rape 
and incest cases, Rep. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no conclusions were reached during the 45-minute meeting, Snowe said, 
she thought it was worthwhile to open a line of communication to Bush on 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to view the Republican Party as totally intransigent on 
the issue," Snowe said. "This would totally alienate about half the population 
. . . . We want to avoid political losses." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island said after the 45-minute meeting with 
Bush: "I think there may be some room for him to reconsider (his veto) but he 
didn't say so. This is just reading his attention and thoughtfulness." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the House Appropriations Committee approved by voice vote a new 
version of the Labor-HHS money bill without the abortion provision that 
triggered the veto. That provision may be added by the Senate, however, forcing 
yet another vote in the House -- a vote that abortion rights advocates predict 
they can win. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the appropriations panel also approved a new version of a money bill 
for Washington, D.C., which includes a ban on use of federal funds for 
abortions but allows the local government to use its own tax resources to pay 
for abortions if it wishes. Bush vetoed a previous D.C. appropriations bill 
because it did not forbid government payment for all abortions except in cases 
where the life of the mother is endangered.

BONES ARE THOSE OF GIRL LONG MISSING

<P>
Months of detailed work by a Riverside County deputy coroner resulted in a sort 
of tragic success Tuesday when scattered bones found in a remote canyon were 
identified as those of a 7-year-old San Diego girl missing for 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Kunzman insisted on literally sifting the dirt that finally led to the 
discovery of teeth that were key to identifying the victim. And it was 
Kunzman's persistence in tracing hundreds of missing-persons reports that ended 
in the match-up with Charitie Careins, who was last seen near a Pacific Beach 
camping area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have children and I couldn't stand here and leave things undone," the deputy 
coroner said. "This little girl was a human being, and there is no reason to 
allow a heavy schedule to allow her to be put in a block and forgot about." 
</P>
<P>
Dental records matched against nine teeth found in San Timoteo Canyon, off 
California 60 about 120 miles northeast of San Diego, led to the 
identification, Kunzman said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death is unknown, but Kunzman said the discovery of seven 
fractured ribs indicates that the girl suffered severe trauma. Although an 
exact time of death has not been determined, Kunzman said the condition of the 
bones -- no traces of tissue were discovered -- indicates the girl most likely 
died soon after she was reported missing on Aug. 6, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Events leading to the identification began June 25, when two hikers in the area 
discovered a human skull, Kunzman said. Follow-up searches turned up more 
bones. However, it was not until a fourth search of the canyon, conducted by 
Kunzman in late July, that investigators found the teeth and lower jaw.

MEXICO PROTESTS U.S. MILITARY ROLE IN BORDER FIGHT ON DRUGS

Mexico Tuesday protested a Bush Administration plan to use American troops and 
warplanes against drug traffickers along the U.S.-Mexican border, complaining 
that the move was made without Mexico's consent. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of Mexico . . . neither shares nor supports (the) measures 
announced by the U.S. Department of Defense with regard to the use of its armed 
forces close to the common border," the Mexican Embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Administration's decision "might have negative 
consequences for the bilateral relationship," and added that it was unlikely to 
make a major impact on the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon formally announced the establishment of the new anti-narcotics 
task force, to be based at El Paso, Tex., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will provide military support -- from aerial reconnaissance to 
ground radar surveillance -- to federal, state and local law enforcement 
agencies struggling to stop smugglers who bring illegal drugs from Mexico into 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said Mexico was "consulted" on the decision, but a Mexican 
official said: "We feel that we were not consulted, merely informed." 
</P>
<P>
Historical experience has made Mexico sensitive to any American military 
presence on its border. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Mexican official said the issue would only be a temporary irritant 
in the two nations' complex relationship. "We will get beyond this," he said. 
"This is really not much more than a stone in our shoe." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Pentagon and the State Department tried to play down the impact of the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. military forces will not conduct searches, seizures or arrests, and they 
will serve strictly to support law enforcement agencies in their 
counter-narcotics operations," the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to militarize the border," a State Department official said. 
"The reality is pretty tame. The military has a lot of logistical capabilities 
that can support law enforcement efforts. We're just doing on land what the 
Navy is already doing in the Caribbean. It's not as if we were going to use 
Marines to shoot down aircraft or something."

JAY DEFEO, 60; ABSTRACT PAINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay DeFeo, one of the breakthrough artists from Los Angeles' storied Ferus 
Gallery, the seminal group that helped establish California art as an 
international force, has died in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Her curator, Leah Levy, said Tuesday that the abstract expressionist was 60 
when she died in Oakland Saturday of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently she had been on the faculty of Mills College in Oakland where a 
memorial for her will be held next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The old Ferus Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard where Miss DeFeo established her 
reputation was a haven in the 1950s for modernists, first in Los Angeles and 
then the Bay Area; it was an era that has come to be looked on as the first 
significant emergence of local painters. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her early works, such as "Origin" in 1956 and "The Veronica" in 1957, 
now are housed in such places as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the 
permanent collection of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Others were included in the "Sixteen Americans" exhibition at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 she displayed a 5-by-10-foot abstract called "The Rose" at the old 
Pasadena Museum that was painted but, recalled Times art critic William Wilson, 
"had so much paint on it it looked carved." 
</P>
<P>
It weighed 2,300 pounds and required professional movers and a crane to get it 
from her studio to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Levy said "The Rose" is about to undergo restoration and will be exhibited 
on completion. 
</P>
<P>
Miss DeFeo attended UC Berkeley where she earned both undergraduate and 
graduate degrees, later receiving an honorary doctorate from the San Francisco 
Art Institute in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, after an absence from the Los Angeles art scene, she returned with an 
exhibit of 17 large abstracts. Wilson wrote that "these are paintings that 
remember that painting is about form existing in space mantled with light. . . 
. (The) paintings have lives of their own and their maker is privileged to 
manipulate the grammar of nature in the service of art. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper/1951-1989," a major retrospective of her drawings, 
photo collages and paintings on paper, is scheduled to open at the UC Berkeley 
art museum Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her father, Dr. Henry D. DeFeo, her stepmother, Dorothy, a 
brother and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Before her death she had established a Jay DeFeo Graduate Fellowship at Mills 
College and contributions are asked to it.

LIECHTENSTEIN'S PRINCE FRANZ JOSEF II, 83

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prince Franz Josef II of Liechtenstein, head of that tiny, bucolic principality 
during the half-century that saw it become one of the world's richest nations, 
has died at age 83, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died late Monday after a 
long illness and less than a month after his wife, Princess Gina, died at age 
67. 
</P>
<P>
The prince had been so frail that he was unable to attend her funeral Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The government press office said Franz Josef, whose efforts to secure voting 
rights for women finally succeeded in 1984, died at a hospital in Grabs, just 
over the border in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation, last remnant of the Holy 
Roman Empire. The principality covers 61 square miles of rolling land and 
rugged mountains between Switzerland and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
His 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of his tiny democratic state 
from an underdeveloped and rural country to a sophisticated industrialized 
nation with one of the world's highest per-capita incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Liechtenstein has come to be home to countless tax-avoiding addresses for 
foreign companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Josef enjoyed great popularity among his 28,000 subjects, often mixing 
with them in the streets of Vaduz, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ruling over a happy country," the prince, defined by the constitution as 
"hallowed and sacrosanct," once said in a rare interview. "It is a happy 
country because it is small." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he handed over his executive powers to his son, Hans Adam, the oldest 
of his five children. But he retained the ceremonial role of head of state. 
</P>
<P>
The Liechtenstein constitution gave him the right to veto any piece of 
legislation. But throughout his reign he used the veto only once, to kill a law 
on hunting rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a silly law. It would have turned every garden into a shooting ground," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Born at Frauenthal Castle, Austria, he took office in 1938, succeeding his 
uncle, Prince Franz. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Josef took over a country that was so poor that the government once tried 
in vain to mortgage its prison building, and his father once sold part of the 
family jewels to bail out the government. 
</P>
<P>
The young prince, a nephew of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose 
assassination in Sarajevo triggered World War I, faced his first challenge in 
1938 after Austria became part of the Nazi Reich. 
</P>
<P>
He made history when he used his powers to force the formation of a national 
coalition government after the anschluss and paid an official visit to Hitler 
in March, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
The visit helped make the Nazis "leave us alone because it flattered Hitler's 
ego," he reminisced in a long-ago interview. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Hitler, who was "visibly ill at ease . . . did not make any 
impression at all" on him during the 90 minutes of small talk in the Berlin 
Reich Chancellory. Like neighboring Switzerland, Liechtenstein stayed neutral 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Franz Josef led the country in resisting Soviet demands to 
extradite about 500 Russians, including Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich, heir 
to the throne of All the Russias, who had sought shelter in Liechtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said that Liechtenstein thus was the only 
country that refused to join in what he called one of the "great betrayals." 
Franz Josef called it a "proud chapter" in his country's history. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Josef lost extensive property in Czechoslovakia when it was nationalized 
after the Communist takeover of the country. 
</P>
<P>
But the family's art collection of 1,400 Rubens, Van Dyck and other Old Master 
paintings with a current estimated value of $150 million was saved by being 
moved from Austria to Liechtenstein in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
His holdings later extended throughout the world.

PERSISTENCE WRITES TRAGIC ENDING TO SEARCH FOR GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE McGARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Months of detailed work by a Riverside County deputy coroner resulted in a sort 
of tragic success Tuesday, when scattered bones found in a remote canyon were 
identified as those of a 7-year-old San Diego girl missing for 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
It was Alan Kunzman's insistence on literally sifting the dirt that finally led 
to the discovery of teeth that were key to identifying the victim. And it was 
Kunzman's persistence in tracing hundreds of missing-persons reports that ended 
in the match-up with Charitie Careins, who was last seen 15 months ago near a 
Pacific Beach camping area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have children, and I couldn't stand here and leave things undone," the 
deputy coroner said. "This little girl was a human being, and there is no 
reason to allow a heavy schedule to allow her to be put in a block and forgot 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Dental records matched against nine teeth found in San Timoteo Canyon, off 
California 60 about 120 miles northeast of San Diego, led to the 
identification, Kunzman said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death is unknown, but Kunzman said the discovery of seven 
fractured ribs indicates that the girl suffered severe trauma. Although an 
exact time of death has not been determined, Kunzman said the condition of the 
bones -- no traces of tissue were discovered -- indicates the girl most likely 
died soon after she was reported missing Aug. 6, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Events leading to the identification began June 25, when two hikers in the area 
discovered a human skull, Kunzman said. Follow-up searches turned up more 
bones; however, it was not until a fourth search of the canyon, conducted by 
Kunzman in late July, that investigators found the teeth and lower jaw. Kunzman 
said animals had contributed to the scattering of the remains. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kunzman said, he has made more than 300 telephone inquiries about 
missing persons who fit the age and anatomical profile that a forensic 
anthropologist was able to piece together based on the remains. After contacts 
with many agencies narrowed the search, a San Diego police detective put 
Kunzman in touch with a dentist in Corpus Cristi, Tex., Charitie's place of 
birth, who supplied the dental charts that linked the remains to the girl. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office completed the identification last week and notified San 
Diego police detectives Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's disappearence triggered a citywide search and investigation that 
included a door-to-door search of the Pacific Beach area and the administration 
of a lie detector test to Charitie's parents, Jane and Greg Lewis. They passed. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the child was abducted Aug. 5, 1988, sometime in the afternoon 
after visiting a friend at the Campland on the Bay recreational vehicle park, 
nearly a mile from her Betty Street home. 
</P>
<P>
Described by neighbors as "highly independent" for her 7 years, Charitie often 
traveled throughout the Pacific Beach area unaccompanied. Elizabeth Widtfeldt, 
a neighbor of the Lewises, said Tuesday that Charitie, unlike Widtfeldt's 
7-year-old son, had few travel restrictions and a liberal curfew. 
</P>
<P>
"Charitie had come to the house several times to play, but I denied permission 
because I had thought it was too late," Widtfeldt said, adding that the girl 
sometimes stopped by in the summer after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Another Pacific Beach resident, who asked not to be identified, said the girl 
often traveled beyond boundaries established for her own daughter, who is 4 
years older than Charitie. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about this all the time, but it's especially tragic when it hits so 
close to home," said the Oliver Avenue resident, who lives just a few blocks 
from the area where police believe Charitie was abducted. 
</P>
<P>
The child's disappearance might have remained a mystery if not for Kunzman's 
persistence. Investigators had all but closed the case after initial searches 
yielded inconclusive findings. Kunzman, suspecting that a thorough examination 
of the site would uncover the missing pieces, led a team of searchers who 
literally sifted through the dirt and brush where hikers found the skull. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry and hair found with the remains helped confirm the identification, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kunzman said the results of an autopsy scheduled for later this week may 
provide more clues to the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County sheriff's detectives from the Banning station will be 
investigating, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Charitie's mother now lives in Marion, Ind., and was unavailable for comment. 
Her husband is attending a mechanics' training school in Florida, San Diego 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said.

SNAKE BITES THE HAND THAT'S FREEZING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aveteran snake handler at the San Diego Zoo was bitten Tuesday by a venomous 
mole viper, the first such incident in the zoo's history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Radcliffe, 48, who has worked at the zoo three years and previously 
handled snakes at zoos in Dallas and Ft. Worth, Tex., was listed in good 
condition Tuesday night in the intensive care unit of UC San Diego Medical 
Center. Hospital officials said they expect Radcliffe to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said Radcliffe was about to put the mole viper into a 
freezer in preparation for feeding it to a poisonous red-headed krait from 
Southeast Asia when he was bitten at 9:50 a.m. Tuesday. Kraits feed on other 
snakes, Jouett said, noting that the mole viper is one of 20 "feeder" snakes 
that had arrived in a shipment from a private dealer from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
"Our curator of snakes had never seen a mole viper in 29 years," Jouett said. 
"He had to get a magnifying glass and count the scales on its stomach to be 
able to make a positive identification. The 20 snakes, including the mole 
viper, were not identified as to species or whether or not they were venomous. 
In fact, the mole viper looks exactly like two or three other species of 
nonpoisonous snakes." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said Radcliffe was bitten on the index finger of his right hand, which 
began to "swell and hurt immediately after the bite." Jouett said the zoo keeps 
a well-stocked supply of anti-venom for most poisonous snakes, but has no such 
serum for the mole viper. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Jouett said the zoo was notified Tuesday by officials at the 
Mexico City Zoo that one of their handlers was bitten by an African puff adder, 
necessitating a shipment of puff adder anti-venom from San Diego to Mexico 
City, via the Tijuana airport. He said San Diego police rushed the anti-venom 
to Tijuana for the flight out. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said Radcliffe's was the second bite a poisonous reptile had inflicted 
on a handler, the first occurring in 1984, when a Gila monster bit two 
handlers. But it was the first time a venomous snake had bitten a handler.

SILBERMAN CASE LEGAL JOCKEYING FOCUSES ON TAPS OF PETTI'S CALLS; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING: DESPITE 15 YEARS OF FBI SURVEILLANCE, DEFENSE WILL BE GIVEN 
TRANSCRIPTS OF ONLY 2 CONVERSATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI has been wiretapping reputed San Diego mobster Chris Petti for 15 
years, but only two conversations from that long history of electronic 
surveillance will be turned over to defense attorneys representing Petti, 
Richard T. Silberman and three other men accused in a complex money-laundering 
case, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And, although assistant U. S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. continues to maintain 
that he will not call mobster-turned-informant Robert Benjamin to the stand 
when the case goes to trial in April, defense attorneys insisted that they be 
allowed to hear and challenge his testimony in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the right to subpoena him," said Oscar Goodman, a Las Vegas attorney 
representing Petti. "I want him in there so the jury can see what they're 
dealing with, so the jury can see how this guy is not the paragon of truth." 
</P>
<P>
Petti and Silberman, a San Diego businessman with ties to state Democratic 
Party officials, along with three others were charged earlier this year in U. 
S. District Court with carrying out an elaborate money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government, Silberman, with the aid of Petti, attempted to 
launder money he believed was proceeds from illegal Colombian drug sales, but 
in reality was money from an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
In a status hearing Tuesday morning on the case, Judge J. Lawrence Irving 
indicated he was reluctant to grant requests for delays in the case. He said he 
hoped to have pretrial motions argued in January and the matter before a jury 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the hearing, Gorder acknowledged the federal government's longstanding 
interest in Petti, once considered heir-apparent to Frank (the Bomp) 
Bompensiero, a notorious San Diego underworld figure who was gunned down in 
1977 in an alley in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In describing the FBI's wiretapping efforts against Petti, Gorder said there 
are "a number of other applications and orders, primarily from other (federal 
judicial) districts, authorizing electronic surveillance from 1974 through 
1988." 
</P>
<P>
He said those wiretaps are in addition to the roving wiretap used by the 
government in making the money-laundering case against Petti, Silberman and the 
other defendants. He said some of the taps covering the 15 years involved 
criminal cases that are now closed, and only two of the overheard conversations 
have any bearing in the money-laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder declined to identify the nature of those conversations, other than to 
say that one occurred in Las Vegas and the other in Los Angeles. He agreed to 
arrange for transcripts of both conversations to be turned over to defense 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, however, said the Las Vegas conversation involved Petti and James 
Skountzos, also known as Jimmy Skountz, whom FBI surveillance reports describe 
as "a person known to be a convicted felon with a history of involvement in 
robbery." 
</P>
<P>
And he said the Los Angeles conversation was between Petti and Carmen DiNunzio, 
an alleged mob strongman based in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman declined to discuss the nature of those conversations, and he 
downplayed the significance of any information taken from the wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
He also strongly chastised the government for subjecting Petti to such a 
lengthy period of electronic eavesdropping. He said he wanted transcripts of 
all of the tapes, which he said was "way in excess of 10 tapes, even more than 
30 or 40," to see if any of them were improperly ordered or conducted illegally 
and therefore "tainted." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is possible that, if these earlier tapes were conducted improperly, 
the roving wiretap also might have been done incorrectly, or at the least the 
information obtained for the indictment was gathered illegally. 
</P>
<P>
He said the FBI often harasses targets of their investigations. He said a 
former client of his, Anthony (Tony the Ant) Spilotro, was once the subject of 
1,143 wiretaps obtained in just one year. Spilotro was reportedly the Chicago 
mob's overseer in Las Vegas and a close associate of Petti; his body was found 
in an Indiana farm field. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's attorney, James J. Brosnahan of San Francisco, did not attend 
Tuesday's hearing. But, in a letter to Irving on behalf of all the defense 
attorneys, Brosnahan echoed Goodman's concerns that Benjamin be compelled to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, a Petti associate, was enlisted by the FBI to put Petti in touch with 
the undercover agent posing as the money launderer. According to the 
prosecutors, Petti in turn put the undercover agent in touch with Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan, in his letter to the judge, said he wants the government to turn 
over Benjamin's "conviction record and evidence of any criminal offenses that 
he is known or believed by the government to have committed since he became a 
government informant in 1977." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also asks how much government money Benjamin was paid to work on the 
case and whether he was involved in any other criminal investigation at the 
time he was working for the FBI on the Petti-Silberman case. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, the letter said, "is responsible for the government's decision to 
target" the defendants. Background information about him "is critical to the 
defense, whether or not Mr. Benjamin is called as a witness," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature and extent of Mr. Benjamin's criminal activity will bear, for 
example, on the credibility of the information used to obtain the various 
search warrants and wiretap authorization orders," the letter added, "and on 
the materiality of omissions in the affidavits concerning Mr. Benjamin's 
reliability." 
</P>
<P>
Since the indictments were returned in April, Benjamin has been moved to an 
undisclosed location under federal protective custody.

It was another setback for the Church of the Most High Goddess. 
</P>
<P>
High Priestess Mary Ellen Tracy and her husband, Wilbur, were arrested on 
pandering charges Tuesday after a woman undercover officer applied for a job at 
the so-called sex church in the Silver Lake area, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Doug 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon Country couple had been free on bail pending an appeal of their 
September conviction on prostitution charges. Mary Tracy claimed at the time 
that one of the church rituals is for male "worshipers" to have sex with her in 
exchange for monetary "sacrifices" in excess of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Alan Vanderpool said Tuesday that he overheard 
Wilbur Tracy brag to the undercover officer, who was wearing a hidden 
microphone, that the church was well known, thanks to television. 
</P>
<P>
TV reporters, Tracy explained, "always call during the sweeps" period, when the 
size of the stations' audiences are measured in order to set their advertising 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
No film at 11. 
</P>
<P>
You may have read in The Times that some businessmen linked to King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia headed a group that secretly acquired a major stake in leases on 
public land in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, they picked a spot with an appropriate name. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Marina del Rey roughly translates as "The King's Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Who says there's no night life in downtown L.A.? Certainly not the three 
black-clad daredevils who scaled an office building under construction on 
Figueroa Street and then tried to parachute to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that two of the jumpers floated all the way down, police 
said. But a third hit some trees and landed around the corner on a fourth-floor 
patio of the First Los Angeles Bank building on Wilshire Boulevard at about 
1:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, that parachutist apparently opted to descend the final floors the 
slow way. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Ted Matthews said: "We found a trail of leaves leading to the fire 
escape." 
</P>
<P>
Had the Grinch struck in Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
There it was -- a "For Sale" sign plastered on the side of a "Santa and Live 
Reindeer" trailer in a vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was some surplus equipment owned by a Christmas tree company that 
displays live deer at some locations. 
</P>
<P>
Santa's still got his sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone looking for some light entertainment might consider the following 
seminars open to the public at Caltech this week: 
</P>
<P>
Today: "Studies on Retinal Proteins: Visual Transduction, Photoaxis and 
Bleaching Adaptation." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: "Murine Developmental Control Genes." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: "Multi-Cellular Motion in Enclosures With Lateral Heating." 
</P>
<P>
The last, by the way, is not a reference to driving on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
As far as we know.

MOTORCYCLIST CHARGED WITH KILLING JOGGER WAS UNLICENSED TO USE VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Bonita motorcyclist charged with killing a woman jogger by running over her 
was not licensed to operate a motorcycle, a state Department of Motor Vehicles 
employee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jerald Covey, 29, was charged with vehicular manslaughter in the Nov. 5 death 
of Stephanie Rossi, 29, a Bonita nurse who police say was hit head-on while 
jogging on Sweetwater Road. California Highway Patrol spokesman Lance Mino said 
Rossi died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Covey, who is scheduled to appear in South Bay Municipal Court on Nov. 21, was 
arrested at the scene, Mino said. The suspect is free on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
A DMV records clerk said Tuesday that Covey "has a clean record," but is not 
licensed to operate a motorcycle. The only California license issued to Covey 
was for non-commercial motor vehicles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the CHP is still investigating the accident, Covey's arrest and 
subsequent release stirred considerable argument and some finger-pointing 
between the CHP and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators put the time of the accident at 4:45 p.m. According to Steve 
Casey, spokesman for Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, Covey was taken to Scripps 
Hospital in Chula Vista by paramedics and arrived at about 5:20 p.m. Covey was 
not accompanied by a CHP officer, Casey said, and walked away from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was discovered missing at about 5:55 p.m. and was not arrested again until 
about 9 p.m., when he returned home. Prosecutors were disturbed by Covey's 
departure from the hospital, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that, once an individual is placed under arrest, that 
individual is not shipped off to some other destination but remains in the 
custody of law enforcement at all times, even in a hospital," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Mino declined to respond to Casey's comment, saying that a final report on the 
incident will not be available until later this week. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials also revealed that Covey was not given a blood-alcohol test until 
"two or three hours" after the accident. At the time of his arrest, Covey was 
charged with murder, felony hit-and-run, felony drunk driving and resisting 
arrest. But the murder charge was later reduced to vehicular manslaughter and 
the other charges were dropped, Mino said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mino said investigators are still awaiting the results of Covey's 
blood-alcohol test, but argued that the delay in administering the test will 
not hamper the CHP's efforts to pursue a drunk-driving charge against Covey. 
</P>
<P>
"All indications show alcohol in his system," he said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp differences also arose between prosecutors and CHP officials when a CHP 
spokesman charged that the district attorney's office downplayed Rossi's death 
and failed to arraign Covey within 48 hours, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in engaging in second-guessing, but the fact is that the 
CHP accident report was incomplete," Casey said. "The (prosecutor) who reviewed 
the report determined there wasn't enough information there to pursue a 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Casey added that it was CHP officials who later reduced the murder charge to 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Mino attempted to smooth over the differences between the two law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got somebody working on it full time, completing the questions that the 
district attorney has directed to us. We will have all that information 
available when the final report is in. . . . We're making sure that everything 
is complete," said Mino. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi's husband, Tom Rossi, has also criticized the CHP investigation, Mino 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"We have contacted the family and assured them that we're doing everything 
possible to complete the investigation," said Mino. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rossi could not be reached for comment.

POLICE ASSIGN DETECTIVE TO SIMI'S RISING 'HATE' INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a series of racial incidents, the Simi Valley Police Department 
has assigned a detective to investigate "hate" crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the rate of this type of crime has increased from less than 1% per 
year to several in a six-month period, and that's a matter of concern," Lt. 
Robert Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
Klamser said police have documented six such incidents in the last six months, 
ranging in severity from the writing of racist graffiti to the ransacking and 
defacing of a black teacher's home. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, a group of youths described as skinheads robbed a liquor store 
and threw a baseball bat at the owner's nephew. The nephew, a 28-year-old 
Korean immigrant, was injured slightly as he chased the youths into a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday night, racist and Nazi slogans including the words "skinz" and 
"white power" were spray-painted onto cinder-block walls enclosing residential 
developments, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Sylmar youths dressed as skinheads were detained by a neighbor and 
questioned and released by police officers near Friday night's 
graffiti-painting, Detective Anthony Anzilotti said. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Ventura County chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People criticized the Simi Valley police, asking why no 
arrests have been made in the vandalism of the black teacher's home, discovered 
Aug. 14 when he and his family returned from a trip. The word "skinheads" was 
among the graffiti spray-painted inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
"If a white family was involved, then somebody black would be in jail by now," 
said the NAACP official, John Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Police response was also questioned by the president of a Simi Valley synagogue 
that was vandalized with racist graffiti in May. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jawitz, president of Temple Ner Tamid, said the police had increased 
nightly patrols after a May 29 vandalism attack but were slow to respond to a 
series of harassing incidents apparently committed by neighborhood children. On 
Friday morning, according to Jawitz, an 11-year-old boy threw an egg at a woman 
entering the synagogue and called her a religious epithet. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jawitz, police officers responding to the incident said they could 
do little because of the boy's age but offered to speak to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Klamser said state law makes it difficult to prosecute children under the age 
of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the six incidents have involved vandalism, Klamser said, the 
department assigned a property-crimes detective to also investigate all hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"It will help the department keep a handle on the amount and type of things 
going on," said Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller. "Obviously, if it increases we'll 
put more people on it." 
</P>
<P>
The series of events documented so far by police began with the May vandalism 
of Temple Ner Tamid. The incident that generated the most publicity and concern 
was the August vandalism of the home of Northridge Junior High School teacher 
Louis Boss. An estimated $20,000 in damage was caused when the house was 
ransacked and defaced with racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, swastikas and white-supremacist slogans were painted two 
times last month on the tennis courts of Simi Valley High School.

COUPLE CONVICTED OF PROSTITUTION ARRESTED IN NEWEST 'SEX CHURCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country woman who claims to be the high priestess of an ancient 
Egyptian religion that worships by engaging in sex acts -- which led to her 
conviction on prostitution charges two months ago -- was arrested again Tuesday 
and accused of recruiting another woman to work in what police called a house 
of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy and her husband, Will Tracy, were arrested by Los Angeles 
police vice officers in a tiny, one-bedroom house in Silver Lake, the church's 
latest headquarters. Detective Alan Vanderpool said police would ask the 
district attorney's office to file charges of pandering, a felony, against the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested the couple about 1 p.m. after a female undercover officer met 
the Tracys at the house to discuss the possibility of becoming a priestess in 
the Church of the Most High Goddess, which the Tracys describe as an ancient 
religion God ordered them to revive. Vanderpool said the couple acknowledged to 
the officer that sex acts were performed in the house and that men made 
donations to take part in them. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys maintain the payments are "religious sacrifices" protected by the 
First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy, 47, was handcuffed and led away from the house on Griffith 
Park Boulevard wearing what has become her trademark costume during many 
appearances on television talk shows -- fishnet stockings, black high-heeled 
shoes and a strapless red sequined dress. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys did not resist as police searched the house, which featured a large 
nude photograph of Mary Ellen Tracy on the wall. The only major pieces of 
furniture were a couch, a love seat and a bed covered with a furry red spread. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy was sentenced to 90 days in jail after she was convicted Sept. 
8 of prostitution and operating a house of prostitution. Will Tracy was 
convicted of operating a house of prostitution and sentenced to 180 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys, who have been free on bail while appealing their convictions, said 
they were still practicing their religion. Four weeks ago, Mary Ellen Tracy 
told The Times: "I am still performing the rituals as they were prescribed by 
the goddess. I have not changed anything." 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, said the couple made tape recordings of all conversations in 
the house to show that their actions were genuinely religious. Such recordings, 
he said, would prevent police from lying about the church in court. But on 
Tuesday, police made a recording of their own through a hidden microphone worn 
by the undercover officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys' media appearances brought complaints that prompted the arrests 
Tuesday, Lt. Sam Dacus said. Many people who had heard them on broadcast shows 
called police, complaining that the Tracys' religious claims were offensive and 
asking why they were allowed to continue operating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderpool said police kept the house under surveillance and interviewed five 
men who were leaving the residence Oct. 24 and Nov. 7. They said they paid 
money to have sex with Mary Ellen Tracy.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARAPLEGIC SMOKER DIES IN OXYGEN-FUELED FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 58-year-old paraplegic woman burned to death in her bed after a cigarette she 
was smoking touched off a flash fire fueled by oxygen from her respirator, the 
Burbank Fire Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Jean Hulme, was alone in her apartment in the 300 block of Amherst 
Drive when the fire broke out about 9:30 a.m. Monday, Capt. Steve Patterson 
said. The fire burned part of the bed but did not spread through the apartment, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said Hulme had been using a respirator for several years because of 
breathing problems and a blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The machine extracts oxygen from the air and purifies it, Patterson said. Tubes 
from the device may have been lying on the bed, saturating the mattress with 
oxygen before the fire erupted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Jack, had left the apartment about 9 a.m. to go shopping with his 
grandchildren, Patterson said.

I hope that every voter in California saw Conrad's cartoon on Sen. Alan 
Cranston (Nov. 12) "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The shadow 
knows!" and read the front-page story ("Bush Hints He May Oust Top Thrift 
Overseer"), noting that Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators received 
$1.3 million in political contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Cranston's intervention with regulators on Lincoln's behalf has 
resulted in a $2-billion bill to be paid by the taxpayers, will, hopefully, be 
remembered on election day. Keating deserves to be in jail, and Cranston, most 
assuredly, does not deserve to be in the U.S. Senate!

<P>
If Edwin Gray's (former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) charges 
against Sens. Cranston, John Glenn (D-Ohio), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) prove to be accurate, all four should resign their Senate 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
I am especially disillusioned at the possibility that Glenn and McCain are 
involved in Keating's sordid Lincoln S&amp;L mess. Glenn has been one of our 
national role models. And McCain earned our admiration for his steadfast 
courage despite years of torture while a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. How 
could they? 
</P>
<P>
If these senators lied recently in denying Gray's account of their closed-door 
meeting with him, they have sunk to a new low.

In response to "Scarcely Senatorial" (editorial, Oct. 29): 
</P>
<P>
It really rankles me to watch those who make the laws be the most adept at 
breaking them. I guess it should figure that way though, and we shouldn't be 
surprised that Cranston's devious scheme to fund his reelection campaign 
completely defeated the intent of the Fair Political Practices Commission's 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
But the quid pro quo of this money-raising hanky-panky is the big crime 
committed against the taxpayers. Was Cranston's role in the failure of Lincoln 
S&amp;L any less criminal than Jim Bakker's confidence game which netted him 45 
years in prison?

How discouraging to read the letter (Nov. 5) from the reader who suggested that 
a $5 rebate be given to the citizens who voted. Aren't people aware yet that 
there are those willing to give their lives for the free elections that so many 
Americans seem to take for granted? We have seen what happened in China. What 
more is it going to take for people to realize that the right to vote should 
not be treated as an inconvenience but as a privilege? 
</P>
<P>
In the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "Nobody will ever deprive the 
American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves -- 
and the only way they could do that is by not voting."

NURSE DEFENDS JAIL'S CARE OF INMATE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: INJURIES TO STANLEY MALINOVITZ, WHO DIED IN CUSTODY, WEREN'T UNUSUAL 
OR SEVERE, ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY IN A SUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A county nurse testified Tuesday that she did not think an inmate who died in 
jail needed immediate medical attention despite his state of confusion, 
uncontrollable laughter and obvious injuries and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Helen Johnson, who examined Stanley Malinovitz shortly after he was 
admitted to the Los Angeles County Jail on Jan. 24, 1984, said she thought he 
had a mental illness and sent him to the jail mental ward for closer 
observation and in-depth examination. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying on behalf of the county, Johnson said Malinovitz's physical 
injuries, which included bruises on his back and stomach and injuries on his 
face and arms, were not severe or unusual among jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Malinovitz, 38, died from a blood clot in his lung four days after he arrived 
in jail. His wife and children are suing the county for unspecified damages. 
They claim that the county never provided Malinovitz with medical care despite 
obvious symptoms that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers have argued that Malinovitz's bizarre behavior stemmed from a 
mental illness, not the blood clot that killed him. They say that jail staff 
caring for Malinovitz provided appropriate treatment for someone who was 
mentally ill and that Malinovitz never showed any symptoms of his fatal 
physical ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Malinovitz would not cooperate when she tried to take his blood 
pressure and asked him about his medical history. Rather than sending him back 
to the unit with the rest of the inmates, she said, she sent him to the mental 
ward for observation and care. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure he was unable to take care of himself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies testified Tuesday that Malinovitz 
appeared to be mentally unbalanced but not in need of immediate medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jack Wegner, a 21-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, said 
Malinovitz was "obviously disturbed" when he came to the San Fernando 
Courthouse on Jan. 24, 1984, to be arraigned on assault charges for allegedly 
pushing an elderly lady to the ground at a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was yelling incoherent statements that people were trying to kill him and 
that his wife and brothers had given him something to make him crazy," said 
Wegner, who was a guard in the holding tank at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy David Busk, who escorted Malinovitz through the jail admittance 
procedure later that day, said he was convinced that Malinovitz did not realize 
he was in jail. Busk said he twice made racial slurs about black people. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know where he was," Busk said. "I thought he was either looking to 
get hurt or going to get hurt, if he made comments like that in the Men's 
County Jail."

STELLO IS NOT THE MAN FOR NRC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tenure of James D. Watkins as President Bush's secretary of energy has been 
brief but refreshing. Watkins, a retired admiral who brought order out of chaos 
at the Reagan Administration's AIDS commission, has initiated a long overdue 
review of U.S. energy policy and has dealt forcefully with the alarming 
problems at the department's 17 nuclear weapons plants. But Watkins' record so 
far has one serious blot that would vanish if he would drop the choice of 
Victor Stello Jr. to be assistant secretary for defense programs in charge of 
the weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing Stello, former chief of staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
the Bush Administration clearly wanted someone who knew the nuclear industry 
and had a capacity for cracking heads to get jobs done. Stello may fit those 
criteria, but his credibility was so damaged at the NRC that his chances of 
fulfilling his mandate at the Energy Department are undermined before he even 
gets an opportunity to start. In advance of Stello's confirmation hearing 
before the Senate Armed Services Committee today, five Democratic senators 
distributed a letter urging President Bush to withdraw the Stello nomination. 
The senators, including California's Alan Cranston and Nevada's Richard Bryan, 
said that even if Stello is confirmed, the controversy surrounding him would 
critically impair his ability to run the department's weapons program. They are 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
During his time at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Stello became embroiled 
in several curious controversies and exhibited questionable behavior for a 
regulator of such a sensitive industry. In one instance, he approved a $6,000 
cash payment to a former utility company worker to obtain information that 
would imply dereliction of duty on the part of another high NRC staff official. 
The propriety of the payment has been under investigation in Congress. A Senate 
subcommittee reported that the affair appeared to be motivated as much by 
"personal and professional animosity" as by safety concerns. Rep. Peter H. 
Kostmayer (D-Pa.) claimed that Stello's testimony before the Senate on the 
payment matter contradicted what he told a House subcommittee. The House 
subcommittee staff said the payment was part of "a wasteful investigation with 
revenge the primary motive." 
</P>
<P>
As head of the NRC investigation of the Three Mile Island accident, Stello was 
accused of failing to pursue allegations that TMI operators had falsified 
cooling system leak rates to keep the reactor running and of withholding 
information about the severity of the accident. Critics have brought other 
claims of Stello's alleged interference in NRC safety enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the claims have been substantiated. But this critical job demands an 
appointee who is above any such suspicion, a person with unimpeachable 
credibility. Adm. Watkins would do well to renew his search for such a person.

'PRO-CHOICE INTENSITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schneider's article on abortion blandly states that the issue is one of faith 
versus reason. 
</P>
<P>
I read the article curious to see how one could "reason" to a pro-abortion 
stance and explain the scientific facts regarding the life, humanity and early 
viability of the fetus as "faith." 
</P>
<P>
My curiosity went unsatisfied; nowhere in the article's 30 paragraphs is there 
any such explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider has it backwards as is evidenced by the concentration of pro-abortion

ENCINO BUILDING PERMIT UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WRONG PROJECT AFTER RECEIVING 
PLANS OF A DIFFERENT VENTURA BOULEVARD COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Angry Encino homeowners Tuesday failed in their effort to require the developer 
of a controversial retail and office complex on Ventura Boulevard at Woodley 
Avenue to prepare an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Although the homeowners claimed that the report was needed to determine 
measures for coping with the additional congestion and noise that the project 
would bring to the area, the Los Angeles Building and Safety Commission ruled 
that city building and safety officials were justified in issuing a permit to 
Golden West Properties without requiring the report. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners said they felt that the effect on traffic and noise had been 
adequately addressed by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said he was considering legal 
action to halt the project. "We have to consider all our options, but we are 
not happy with what has happened today," he said following the five-member 
panel's unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story project, which will cost at least $10 million, is composed of 
49,000 square feet of retail space, 20,000 square feet of office space and an 
11,500-square-foot restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who appeared before the commission said they had not been given 
adequate notice of the project by city officials. Silver said that when he 
learned of the project last August, he asked representatives of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Marvin Braude to send him documents on the proposed project so 
that he could file a formal protest. 
</P>
<P>
However, Silver said he was mistakenly sent documents about a different Ventura 
Boulevard project and unwittingly filed a protest against the wrong project. He 
learned later that the permit was granted after no opposition was registered. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens were denied due process," Silver said. "The mix-up on the 
notification took their rights away from them. This project is aesthetically 
unacceptable and cannot be allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Reznik, attorney for Golden West Properties, said the project was 
reviewed and approved by the city's Department of Transportation and the 
Building and Safety Department's Environmental Review Committee. "There is no 
substantial evidence to show that this project will have a negative impact," he 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Customers of a La Jolla restaurant have been told that they may have been 
exposed to the more infectious form of hepatitis -- type A -- and should see 
their physicians immediately for gamma globulin injections, county public 
health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Diners who ate dinner salads or drank from glasses decorated with strawberry 
and pineapple garnishes at Aloha Louie's, in the 1100 block of Prospect Street, 
between 5 and 10 p.m. on Nov. 6 and 7 may have been exposed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory was issued after county health officials learned of a case of 
hepatitis A in a worker at the restaurant. The employee has not worked since 
Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We urge people to see their physician as soon as possible, since the gamma 
globulin is only effective if it is given within two weeks of exposure," said 
Dr. Nancy Bowen, acting county health officer. "Gamma globulin is not available 
at county public health clinics." 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that some people might have been infected before the 6th of 
November at the restaurant," she said. "However, gamma globulin will not help 
these people. It is important, though, for them to be aware of the symptoms of 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Initial symptoms are a sudden onset of fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, 
nausea and abdominal discomfort, which may be followed within a few days by 
jaundice, a yellowish color to the eyes and skin. The degree of the illness 
varies from person to person, from very mild to severe. Infectious hepatitis 
can take anywhere from 15 to 50 days to develop, usually a month."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hearing final instructions Tuesday morning from U. S. District Judge Earl 
B. Gilliam, the jury in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter 
began deliberating the 197 charges against the former J. David and Co. 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-woman, five-man jury received instructions for about an hour before 
beginning what promises to be many days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam instructed the jury on the technical aspects of the law affecting the 
six categories of charges against Hunter -- conspiracy, income-tax evasion, 
aiding and abetting in the preparation of false tax returns, making false 
statements to a government agency, mail fraud and fraud by a commodities pool 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces 197 counts in an indictment that alleges that she played an active 
role in the giant J. David Ponzi scheme. When the La Jolla brokerage house was 
forced into involuntary bankruptcy in February, 1984, about 1,200 investors 
lost $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's former lover, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, is serving a 20-year prison 
term for masterminding the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Since the trial began in April, Hunter's attorneys have been trying to persuade 
the jury that their client was kept completely in the dark about Dominelli's 
fraud. The defense contends that Dominelli and his inner circle of associates 
constantly lied to Hunter about his alleged money trading and that Hunter was 
blinded by love for him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will be considering the testimony of about 150 witnesses, as well as 
2,000 pieces of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Court observers predict prolonged deliberations. Apparently the jurors expect 
the same; only 90 minutes after the start of their deliberations they asked 
Gilliam for a Nov. 24 vacation day.

ARCADIA SHOCKS THOUSAND OAKS

<P>
When the great teams lose, they usually fall hard. But there wasn't a large 
thud when the Arcadia High girls' volleyball team defeated Thousand Oaks, 
18-16, 15-12, 15-11, Tuesday night at Thousand Oaks High to advance to the 
Southern Section 4-A Division semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
When Arcadia's Jennifer Kennedy spiked the game-winning point, most of the 
Lancers covered their faces and walked quietly off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing more, nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Thousand Oaks (16-2), the 2-A champion in 1986 and 1987 and 4-A 
runner-up last year, wasn't sure how to act. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new feeling," Lancer Coach Ron Beick said. "It's going to hurt. 
Everybody will go home and think of a thousand things they could have done to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Captain Amy Chellevold, who had 15 kills and 22 assists, expressed more regret 
than anger. "This year we really wanted to win it," Chellevold said. "It's just 
too bad we didn't play to our potential." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, ranked No. 6 coming into the match, twice blew chances to win the 
first game, losing leads of 14-12 and 16-15 before Arcadia, ranked No. 3, ended 
the game on consecutive kills by outside hitter Erin Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing comes easy in the quarterfinals," Beick said. "After we lost the first 
game, we just didn't come out strong enough in the second game." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks led, 7-5, in the second game, but Arcadia (21-1) outplayed the 
Lancers at the net and scored eight of the next 10 points to take a 13-9 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The final game was also close. The Lancers trailed, 13-11, before Alyson Becker 
served an ace and Kennedy spiked the game-winning point. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks middle blocker Debbie Buchue had 14 kills and Erikka Gulbranson 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches: 
</P>
<P>
Royal d. Fountain Valley, 15-13, 15-8, 15-7 -- Wendy Brown notched 11 kills to 
lead host Royal (16-1) to a 4-A Division quarterfinal win. But it was Beth 
Kohs' nine digs that earned praise from Coach Bob Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
"She was all over the floor," Ferguson said. "She owned the court." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley finished its season 16-3. Royal will face the winner of the 
Santa Monica-Louisville match Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
La Reina d. Alta Loma, 15-5, 15-6, 15-7 -- Heather Freeman had 10 kills and 10 
blocks to lead host La Reina to a 2-A quarterfinal victory. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Alta Loma's first in 19 matches. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Russo added seven kills and 15 digs for the winners (17-2). La Reina 
will face the winner of the Arroyo Grande-La Mirada match Thursday night at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita d. L.A. Baptist, 15-12, 13-15, 15-12, 9-15, 15-9 -- Andrea 
Lucadam had 21 kills, but that wasn't enough to help L. A. Baptist (16-2) get 
past Santa Margarita in a 1-A quarterfinal match at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Davis had 11 kills for L. A. Baptist (16-2). Santa Margarita improves to 
17-1. SCOT BUTWELL

CALABASAS TAKES SINGLE-MINDED APPROACH IN 10-8 QUARTERFINAL VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Natasha Pospich, Stacy Jellen and Alison Paris -- possibly the Southern 
Section's top singles trio -- swept their matches Tuesday to lift Calabasas 
High over Westlake, 10-8, in a 3-A Division tennis quarterfinal match at 
Westlake Village Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas (15-0), the fifth-seeded team, won just one doubles match in 
defeating the fourth-seeded Warriors (21-1). 
</P>
<P>
"I figured Natasha and Stacy would be untouchables," Westlake Coach Connie 
Flanderka said. "If we got any of those games, it would just be icing on the 
cake." 
</P>
<P>
Jellen and Paris each lost four games in three matches. Pospich, a junior who 
has lost just four games all season, won her three matches by 6-0 scores. 
</P>
<P>
The wins came as no surprise to Pospich. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these people," she said. "I've played almost all of them in tournaments 
so I knew I could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas Coach Bill Belatty says that his top two players assure the Coyotes 
of six points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to find a one-two punch like Natasha and Stacy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes were, however, considerably weaker in doubles. Alyse Bartelstone 
and Alison Levitt, Westlake's No. 3 team, defeated Samantha Meo and Tracy 
Paris, 6-2, Melissa Pifko and Jenny Gilbert, 6-3, and Faye Reisman and Jenny 
Rabin, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Kim Stewart and Ari Kia also won all three of their doubles matches, 
one by default. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas will play top-seeded Capistrano Valley, a 12-6 winner over Laguna 
Hills, in the semifinals Thursday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
In another Southern Section match: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 13, Louisville 5 -- The Royals (19-3) were eliminated in the 2-A 
quarterfinal match at home as No. 1 singles player Maureen Sifferman was 
defeated in three matches, 7-5, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
City Section 
</P>
<P>
Taft 7, University 0 -- Julie Koppekin, Taft's No. 1 singles player recorded a 
victory in a 4-A Division quarterfinal at The Racquet Center in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Taft will play Fairfax, a 4-3 winner over Grant, in a semifinal match Thursday.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WASHINGTON MAKES BIG IMPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: GRANADA HILLS' TALENTED JUNIOR FULLBACK PROVES WELL WORTH THE WEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Each summer, they line up like soldiers in formation, according to their 
desired position. The problem, of course, is that there can only be so many 
generals. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case last year when a rather stout and unknown sophomore named 
Brett Washington announced to Granada Hills High Coach Darryl Stroh that he 
wanted to be the Highlanders' next breakaway runner. Stroh, as he had done 
innumerable times with other varsity hopefuls, humored the lad. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in and he said he wanted to be a tailback," Stroh recalled. "And I 
said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. You're more like a fullback and a nose guard.' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington, now a 5-foot-10, 215-pound junior, soon proved that his objectives 
were not necessarily out of kilter. And he restates the point every time the 
players line up for sprints. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never know it," Stroh said, "But he usually finishes in the top one or 
two." 
</P>
<P>
After rushing for 165 yards in Granada Hills' 38-14 win over San Fernando in 
last Thursday's North Valley League showdown, Washington is indeed numero uno. 
</P>
<P>
After nine games, Washington has rushed for 1,082 yards in 139 carries (an 
average of 7.4 yards a carry) and scored 12 touchdowns. His rushing total leads 
all Valley-area City Section players. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, Granada Hills' only full-time, two-way starter, is the first 
Highlander to reach the 1,000-yard mark since Khalid Ali gained 1,388 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
And Washington also is emerging as a favorite for the North Valley Player of 
the Year award. As a running back, he can pound inside or hit the corner and 
slice down the sideline. As a first-year linebacker -- he started at defensive 
tackle last year -- Washington uses his substantial bulk to put opponents down. 
And out. 
</P>
<P>
"He turned out to be too good to put down (on the defensive line)," Stroh said. 
"When he came in last year, we didn't know exactly what we had." 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents can't readily identify him, either. Washington has been likened 
by some to a runaway roller coaster. When handed the ball on a draw play, 
Washington is able to build momentum and is almost impossible to stop in a 
one-on-one situation. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after Washington rolled through the middle of the Cleveland 
defensive line for another long gain, Cavalier Coach Steve Landress turned to a 
bystander and asked rhetorically: "Is that kid a load or what? He's a stud. 
There's no way one guy brings him down." 
</P>
<P>
And, considering that Cleveland is the only team that has kept Washington out 
of the end zone this year, those are some pretty decent kudos. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's 78-yard scoring run in the third quarter broke San Fernando. After 
being stopped for a short gain on third down, the Tigers were called for a 
face-mask penalty. On the next play, Washington took the handoff, worked his 
way outside and pulled away from several surprised -- and supposedly faster -- 
defensive backs. A tie soon turned into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
"The sign of a great back," Stroh said, "is to make the first guy miss. He 
knows that now." 
</P>
<P>
And if Washington knows this much now, what about next season? Perhaps after 
Canyon's Chris Perry -- who stands 6-2 and weighs 215 -- graduates this summer 
Washington will emerge as the area's next big thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, he was good," Granada Hills co-Coach Tom Harp said. "This year, 
he's really improved -- he's almost great. Next year, who knows?"

SAN DIEGO COUNTY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: NO FOOTBALL TEAM SO CRUSADERS DRIBBLE TO 
HOMECOMING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College may not have a football team, but that does not 
stop it from holding homecoming festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the more familiar surroundings of a football field, the Crusaders 
have two days of events leading up to the basketball season opener at 7:45 p.m. 
Saturday against Dominican College. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the traditional parade and coronation ceremonies, PLNC has alumni 
contests scheduled in tennis, baseball, soccer, volleyball and basketball 
(against the junior varsity at 5:45 p.m. Saturday before the varsity game). 
</P>
<P>
With student enrollment around 2,100, the basketball game is an annual 
standing-room-only affair attracting about 4,000. Reserve seats are sold out, 
and additional bleachers are being erected along the baselines. 
</P>
<P>
Said assistant coach Ted Anderson, "I understand to the rest of the world, it 
is kind of strange. But for me, since I went here and basketball was the main 
sport at my high school, it just seems so natural to have basketball as the 
homecoming." 
</P>
<P>
Dominican, a tiny liberal arts college in Marin County, has just 96 men in the 
school. With a roster of 15, 16% of the male population plays for the 
basketball team. The Penguins were 12-23 in 1988-'89 after going 0-26 in their 
first year, 1987-'88. 
</P>
<P>
Dominican point guard Earnest Riggins is the son of Earnest Riggins, the former 
San Diego women's basketball coach. The younger Riggins played at Grossmont 
Community College before earning all-conference honors at Dominican last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's women's team opens its season at home Friday at 5:45 against UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The men's cross-country team, winners of the NAIA District 3 championship, will 
be competing in the national championships Saturday in Kenosha, Wis. Sophomore 
Goshu Tadese (61st in 1988) and junior Rick Penman will be making a return trip 
having qualified individually last year. From the women's team, AnetteRonnerman 
will run as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Crakes said the team's goal is to finish in the top 10. PLNC is 
ranked No. 9. Of its eight trips to the nationals, PLNC's best finish is 11th 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
How important is a good start? There will be approximately 400 runners in each 
race, but Crakes -- in his 30th year as coach -- said the course is one of the 
few he's seen that can handle such a mass. It is also one of the few places he 
has seen where they charge money for a cross-country event. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego just had perhaps its greatest sports weekend in history. (The day 
last November when it won national championships in both men's soccer and 
women's volleyball was a worthy one, too.) 
</P>
<P>
UCSD won a national championship in one sport and had four others advance to 
national tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Women's soccer won its first NCAA Division III national championship with a 3-2 
overtime victory over Ithaca Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The water polo team won three matches, the Western Water Polo Assn. 
championship and its automatic berth into the NCAA tournament next week. It is 
the first time UCSD has qualified for the eight-team tournament to be held at 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
The men's soccer team, the defending Division III champion, won the West 
Regional Sunday and will play in the semifinals Friday against Elizabethtown, 
Penn., the tournament's host. The finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By sweeping the men's and women's cross-country Western Regional Saturday, UCSD 
will travel to Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill. for the national meet 
Saturday. In the regional, which Coach Mark Stanforth called the greatest in 
UCSD history, Mike Fox finished first, Roger Webb third and Merrell Hora fourth 
for the men. Michelle Conlay won the women's race with teammate Sabrina Jensen 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Women's volleyball, which was ranked No. 1 and had won the past three national 
titles, was the only UCSD team to lose last weekend. The Tritons were upset in 
the Western Regional against Menlo College, but it took five games to do it, 
6-15, 6-15, 15-10, 15-7, 11-15. 
</P>
<P>
As if the sports information office doesn't have enough to do, men's basketball 
begins at 7 p.m. Saturday with a home scrimmage against an Australian team, 
women's basketball plays at PLNC Friday and the men's and women's swimming and 
diving teams play host to the UCSD Relays at 10 a.m. Saturday at Canyonview 
Pool. Thank goodness, the fencing team is on the road Saturday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Conference held its basketball media day Tuesday, ending what is 
believed to be the longest preseason media event in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the location of its schools, the WCC held five separate meetings -- 
in Spokane, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego -- beginning 
nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego, depending on which poll is looked at, is destined 
to finish anywhere from third to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount is picked most often to win the conference followed by 
Pepperdine. Commissioner Michael Gilleran believes Pepperdine has the best team 
followed by Loyola. Three through eight he says are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
USD and St. Mary's are mentioned most often as favorites in the women's WCC 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Heritage men's basketball team begins its season with seven games 
on the road, including the opener in Northern California against Cal State 
Stanislaus followed by three games in Michigan. Later in the season, the Hawks 
take to the air with games in Oregon, Alaska and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage held its fourth annual Blue-White scrimmage Saturday and the 
White team won (110-99) for the fourth consecutive year. Brad Soucie had 26 of 
his game-high 35 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, coaches Swen Nater and David Kirksey participated in their 
alumni game at Cypress Community College. Nater, a former NBA star, was playing 
his first alumni game and scored 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage will have five of its games televised (delayed) on Cox 
Cable's Channel 11. A crew from The Turning Point Network, the television 
ministry of Scott Memorial Baptist Church, will handle the production. 
</P>
<P>
Times have not been finalized, but the games to be shown are home games against 
Biola (Dec. 9), Cal Baptist (Dec. 16), Grand Canyon (Jan. 16), The Master's 
College (Jan. 20) and Azusa Pacific (Feb. 10). The Hawks will be playing their 
home games at Grossmont College this season. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International and Rancho Bernardo Inn are the hosts of the Women's 
Intercollegiate Golf Invitational beginning today through Friday. USIU has won 
the event three years in a row with San Diego State finishing second the past 
two years.

TAYLOR TROUPE SHOWS ITS 3 FACES WITH USUAL VERVE

<P>
Paul Taylor's private domain can be playful and effervescent, darkly mysterious 
or tinged with romance. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, local dance buffs saw samples of all three facets of Taylor's 
world at Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Esplanade," the sunniest and possibly most brilliant work in Taylor's vast 
repertory, was the dazzling centerpiece in a program that included the 
sentimental beauty of "Roses" and the raw, primitive spirit of "Runes." 
</P>
<P>
Because a new generation of dancers dominates the Taylor troupe these days, at 
least six newcomers are still finding their stride in the ensemble of 18. 
Nevertheless, there was enough teamwork among them Monday night to carry off 
the taxing program. 
</P>
<P>
The springy ebullience, musicality and sheer joy of dancing that has been the 
company's calling card for 35 years appears to be in no danger of disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
What could be more natural than walking, running, jumping and falling? Nothing. 
Yet, when those mundane moves are manipulated by a master, as they were in 
"Esplanade," nothing could be more dance-like, or more thrilling to watch. 
</P>
<P>
These everyday movements are so deeply embedded in the modern dance lexicon 
that it is difficult to believe that they were revolutionary in 1975, when 
Taylor altered the course of modern dance with this "non-dance" work. Happily, 
"Esplanade" surfaced in all its pedestrian glory for the company's first 
concert here in six years. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers breezed through the running jumps and sliding falls of "Esplanade" 
with close to the level of throwaway virtuosity that we have seen in the past. 
And they negotiated the exhilarating rolling tumbles at breakneck speed as a 
Bach concerto played out its aural accompaniment. "Esplanade" has been a bona 
fide show-stopper since its world premiere, and it sent the San Diego audience 
home on a kinetic high note. 
</P>
<P>
"Runes" (choreographed soon after "Esplanade" but decidedly different in style 
and mood), revealed Taylor's fascination with the primordial forces in human 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
Although this ominous and oddly disconcerting work is thoroughly modern in its 
movement, it is steeped in ritual, like some ancient tribal rite. There are 
shades of Martha Graham in the thematic content (she was Taylor's mentor), but 
"Runes" has his distinct stamp. And it fit the stage in Symphony Hall well. 
</P>
<P>
For this somber work, the dancers wore fur-trimmed costumes and traversed the 
stage in complex couplings that brought to mind images of multi-limbed deities. 
The dance also has a twitchy section for Taylor veteran Elie Chaib (who danced 
the riveting solo with bent-kneed jumps and animal energy), and some exciting 
passages for the dynamic Sandra Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"Runes" owes a lot of its power to the interesting configurations for the full 
cast and the mounting tension generated by Gerald Busby's dissonant piano 
piece. But Jennifer Tipton's shadowy lighting designs did more than their share 
to enhance this enigmatic work. 
</P>
<P>
That brief period around 1975 when both "Esplanade" and "Runes" evolved was an 
especially creative one for Taylor. And it was a treat to see both pieces 
paired on one program. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor showcased only one work created in this decade, "Roses" (1985). This 
lush and dreamy dance for six couples was inspired by Richard Wagner's 
"Siegfried Idyll," although an adagio for clarinet and strings is tacked on to 
the end of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Roses" unfolded as a striking mosaic of softly flowing phrases, punctuated by 
stabbing gestures. Graceful and thick with sentiment, it featured some lovely 
lifts and romantic images that did not always link up with the aural pastiche. 
However, it was a stunning showpiece for this new crop of dancers. 
</P>
<P>
It began as a labyrinth of intricate moves for five pairs. But, for the final 
moments, while the rest of the cast languished wistfully on the floor, Cathy 
McCann and David Grenke captured the spotlight for a lyrical and sweetly 
romantic duet. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this program did not show any of Taylor's recent work, and there 
are many new pieces that San Diego deserves to see.

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' -- A CACOPHONY OF SOUTHERN BELLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the published version of Robert Harling's play "Steel Magnolias," he opens 
with this cautionary author's note: "The women in this play are witty, 
intelligent and, above all, real characters. They in no way, shape or form are 
meant to be portrayed as cartoons or caricatures." 
</P>
<P>
In Harling's movie adaptation (opening Friday throughout San Diego County), 
directed by Herbert Ross, he must have prefaced his script with the reverse 
caution. The film's yammering sextet is relentlessly cartoonish. They do so 
much prancing and sashaying and elbowing that the film, set in small-town 
Louisiana, turns into Southern-fried vaudeville. The knockabout unbelievability 
is exhausting. You want to run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
M'Lynn (Sally Field) is the well-to-do matron whose pretty-as-a-peach daughter 
Shelby (Julia Roberts), a severe diabetic, is about to be married. Truvy (Dolly 
Parton), the owner of her own styling salon, Truvy's Beauty Spot, presides over 
Shelby's pouffing and perfuming. The Beauty Spot is the town's mission control 
for gossip, and, in the film's opening minutes, we're introduced to its leading 
players. Besides M'Lynn, Shelby and Truvy, there are Clairee (Olympia Dukakis), 
the preening widow of the town's former mayor; Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine), a 
rich, wildly eccentric scold; and Annelle (Daryl Hannah), the salon's mousy new 
"born-again" assistant. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the film, these women are thrown into crises that call upon 
their deepest reserves of empathy. And are they ever empathic! They stalk about 
acting curmudgeonly in order -- of course -- to hide how deeply they care. They 
go in for heavy-duty bonding. Where trouble hits, weeping and wisecracks are 
sure to follow. When Truvy says "Laughter through tears is my favorite 
emotion," she's acting as the writer's mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Harling's play, his first, has been "opened up" as a movie, and, as a result, 
his dramatic intentions are clearer than they were on the stage. "Steel 
Magnolias" is a serio-comic yowl about the sustaining powers of sisterhood. 
It's also, by implication, a retort to all the male-bonding dramas in our 
midst. The film makers want us to recognize the tensile strength in the 
filigree of women's lives. These gals may be nurturing but they're also 
hardscrabble. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the wimpification of the men in this movie is fairly amusing to 
observe. Shelby's husband (Dylan McDermott), her father (Tom Skerrit), 
Annelle's hubbie (Kevin O'Connor), Truvy's mate (Sam Shepard) are all secondary 
players. They loiter, dazed, on the fringes of the action. Because few films 
feature as many women as this one does, their prominence here is a form of 
pay-back. They've seized the screen from the big boys and they won't let go. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the seizing is artful, some isn't. Parton has a sweet, lilting 
presence, and a suggestion of hard-won disappointment beneath her wigs and wide 
smiles. Roberts has such fragile freshness that the scene in which she goes 
into diabetic shock seems like a violation of nature. Dukakis isn't breaking 
any new ground with her trademarked snideness, but she gets off a few zingers. 
(She also seems triumphantly impervious to her sometime Southern accent.) Field 
is rather bland, though -- too teary and noble. And MacLaine is wretched. Her 
performance is a scenery-gobbling amalgam of her work in films like "Terms of 
Endearment" and "Madame Sousatzka." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Truvy's sayings is, "There is no such thing as natural beauty," but 
the entire film stands in opposition to this credo. It is precisely the 
natural, untrussed beauty of these women that we're meant to recognize. Harling 
and Ross may be deliberately going for the exaggerated and the overblown. They 
may be pouffing reality, but only as a heightened contrast to their people's 
all-too-real sorrows. The trouble is, the pouffing crowds out the pathos. 
That's not entirely bad. The slapstick camaraderie at least has some energy, 
while the pathos is shameless, four-hanky stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the film makers have higher ambitions. The six women with their 
different backgrounds and temperaments are intended as a symbolic cross-section 
of femalehood; their plights are representative of all women. But things have 
gotten out of hand. Instead of a soul-sister ensemble, what we get is a 
screenful of ego-pumped actresses clonking each other for the spotlight. These 
belles should take their act on the road as tag-team wrestlers. 
</P>

'3RD THURSDAY' THRIVES WITHOUT ANY SAFETY NET; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CHANNEL 39'S PUBLIC FORUM RISKED GOING LIVE, PUTTING PEOPLE OF 
OPPOSING VIEWS TOGETHER IN AN UNPREDICTABLE, VOLATILE BREW. THE PAYOFF WAS THE 
SPONTANEITY THAT HAS HELPED TO MAKE THE SHOW UNUSUALLY POPULAR FOR ITS GENRE.

As the stunned "Third Thursday" crew looked on, host Marty Levin suddenly 
veered for the phone by the side of the stage. A commercial break during a live 
television show is no time for spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen seconds," warned a nervous-looking floor director. 
</P>
<P>
This particular edition of KNSD-TV's (Channel 
</P>
<P>
39) monthly, live, 90-minute public forum show, was focusing on growth. And it 
was starting to heat up. The six politicians and community activists on stage 
were clearly growing irritated with each other's comments, while members of the 
audience were eagerly raising their hands to make comments and ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are really ready to go," Levin said into the phone, talking to 
show producer Steve Corman, who was in the production truck outside an 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Levin did not want to use the taped segment scheduled for that part of the 
show. Corman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Five seconds," the floor director said. 
</P>
<P>
Levin put the phone down, whirled, hopped over a camera leg and rushed to the 
set. He made it to his position -- barely. Disaster averted. 
</P>
<P>
"Third Thursday," which resumes its once-a-month schedule Thursday at 6:30 p.m. 
with a show on health-care costs, is special. Not only is the 90-minute, 
public-affairs show a rare format in the country, there is an energy created by 
putting people with vastly different perspectives in a room together, and then 
televising the event live. 
</P>
<P>
The emotions stirred up by the issues invariably make for an unpredictable 
brew. 
</P>
<P>
For the show's crew, "Third Thursday" is television on the edge, working 
without a net. 
</P>
<P>
"This," Levin said after the growth program, "is as close as we come to 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
The October edition was a milestone of sorts for "Third Thursday." Almost 
exactly a year earlier, the show went on the air with its first program. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of that first show also was growth, and, everyone seems to agree, 
it was the worst edition of "Third Thursday." It was staged at the North County 
Fair shopping center, and the sound was atrocious, the milling crowd unruly. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the show has come a long way. It has built up a surprisingly 
large audience, in addition to respect in the community, for its open, frank 
discussions of current issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the 6:30-8 p.m. time slot, it has attracted a Nielsen rating as high as a 8 
points -- not spectacular, but solid for a public-affairs show. The audience 
for Channel 39's 5 p.m. news show, in contrast, earned a 4 rating last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The small crew assigned to "Third Thursday" has become a traveling troupe, 
taking the show around the county to different auditoriums each month. It is 
almost routine for them, overcoming regular obstacles with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
This month's edition will air from Wangenheim Junior High School in Mira Mesa. 
The subject, health-care costs, may not be as volatile as past topics, such as 
abortion or animal rights, but 
</P>
<P>
it is impossible to predict the reaction. It is, after all, live television. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Third Thursday' parallels our mission better than any other single element" 
of the station, general manager Neil Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39's promotional slogan is, "We bring it straight to you." With no 
frills and few concessions to traditional television glitz, "Third Thursday" 
couldn't be any straighter. 
</P>
<P>
It brings people together with vastly different points of view to talk about 
issues. People watching at home can call in questions. In addition to five or 
six panelists for each show, the audience is usually laced with a variety of 
other people involved with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be here to at least express my support for the concept," said 
Escondido City Councilman Jerry Harmon, who sat in the audience during the 
growth show. "They're making a concerted efforted to do something, to give the 
community a 
</P>
<P>
forum on key issues." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon wasn't called on during the show, but at one point a panel member 
started discussing growth restrictions in Poway. While he talked, Levin hustled 
up the aisle, and called on a member of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Linda Brannon, deputy mayor of Poway," the audience member said, launching 
into a more accurate explanation of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to Levin to orchestrate events, to ensure that each side has a fair 
chance to speak. Before the growth show, he told the audience not to focus on 
the hot controversy over development along the shores of Miramar Lake, warning 
them that it was not going to be a 90-minute show on the one topic. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, we ask you to minimize the rhetoric and maximize questions," he told 
the crowd before the program began. 
</P>
<P>
At this year's San Diego Press Club Awards, when "Third Thursday" won the award 
for best discussion/interview program, the judges wrote, "The interaction 
between the host and the audience keeps it interesting -- he's good!" 
</P>
<P>
Levin is the ringmaster, keeping things lively and reasonably 
non-confrontational. He chides the audience about not asking enough questions, 
making them feel at ease when they rise to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty does a good job of ensuring there are balanced perspectives," said Herb 
Cawthorne, a leader in the black community and a member of the growth panel. 
"It is as fair as a show can be and still have some teeth to it." 
</P>
<P>
"Third Thursday" producer Steve Corman realizes that the show will never rival 
the ratings of "The Cosby Show" -- or, for that matter, "A Current Affair," its 
competition on KGTV (Channel 10). A veteran of TV productions, with 20 years of 
producing programs in Chicago to his credit, Corman nevertheless has found the 
first year of "Third Thursday" to be a particularly rewarding experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a dream of mine to be involved in something like this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Associate producer Kurt Snider, after five years earning awards working on the 
light and airy "P.M. Magazine" show, left Channel 8 last year to work on "Third 
Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of never-a-cloudy-day television," he said. " 'P.M. Magazine' is a 
co-host driven show; content takes a back seat to presentation. The best part 
about this show is that it's nothing but content." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Snider and Corman, the regular "Third Thursday" crew is composed of 
associate producer Jan Hudson, who spends about 20 hours a week working on the 
show, and Amy Michael, who also produces the weekly half-hour show "San Diego 
Headliners." Dr. Nee Howard, a semi-retired child-development specialist, 
supplies research. 
</P>
<P>
Additional crew members are brought in the night of the show, but it's the core 
group that has to bring the show together month after month. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson spends most of her time on perhaps the biggest problem the show faces 
each month -- finding a location. The site has to be big enough for a studio 
audience and the show's heavy lighting equipment. It also has to be situated in 
such a way to allow the crew to clearly relay signals back to Channel 39. 
</P>
<P>
A different site is used each month. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the purposes of the show is to go to the communities, to make it 
available and accessible," said Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Michael's time is spent dealing with the problem of getting an audience 
to the site. People love to get tickets, but they don't always show up. For 
last month's growth show, more than 500 tickets were given out, but only about 
225 people actually appeared the night of the show -- which turned out to be 
just right for the Mira Mesa High School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The three to four taped segments used during the show -- "fire starters" is the 
way Corman described them -- are produced by Corman and Snider throughout the 
month. They often work at night, since the editing suites at Channel 39 are 
usually used by the advertising department during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the panel is another challenge. The goal is to achieve 
balance without blandness, fairness without mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
A bad panel can ruin a good topic. The program on gangs bombed, Corman said, 
because there was no interaction among the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
"We had people more into speechifying than making valid points," said Corman. 
</P>
<P>
It is a common problem. Put people with causes on live television, in 
particular politicians, and they usually will try to take advantage of the 
opportunity to make a few points. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's mind is going to be changed (by the show)," Levin said. "All you can 
hope for is that at least (the audience) will understand where everybody is 
coming from, and you hope it's enlightening." 
</P>
<P>
The night of the show, uncertainty is more of a problem than the actual 
mechanical setup of the light and sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual arrangement, director Randy Mickler, watching monitors at Channel 
39's main studio, calls the shots -- switch to camera one, or fade to camera 
two -- and relays the instructions to the technical director in the production 
truck at the site via phone. Usually the director is at the site for remote 
broadcasts, but Channel 39 opted for this novel method to help coordinate the 
technical details already being handled at the Channel 39 studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real skeptical at first, but it works very well," Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the introduction and the insertion of the commercials, few of the events 
are mapped out, beyond a general guideline as to how things might best occur. 
There is no script for any of the evening's events. 
</P>
<P>
"The show itself is sort of free-flowing," Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
The show's crew has become adept at spotting trouble before it happens. During 
the first show on growth, they spotted representatives of one group with a 
banner they clearly meant to unfurl during the show. The crew talked them out 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
There have been little problems, though. One show was done at a Loma Portal 
elementary school directly in the Lindbergh Field flight path. The crew tried 
to get into the rhythm of the planes, inserting tapes when a jet flew overhead, 
but it was an example of the type of awkward situations that can develop on 
live television. 
</P>
<P>
During the program on the proposed SDG&amp;E merger with Southern California 
Edison, there was a brief but potentially disastrous power outage. Before the 
show on animal rights, the guests representing the different perspectives 
practically refused to talk to each other, leading the crew to fear a show 
featuring nothing more than glowering, silent combatants. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering the potential for disaster, "Third Thursday" has lived a 
charmed life, even without the protection of the short time delay used by most 
so-called "live" phone-in shows. The callers are truly live. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even had any last-minute cancellations," Corman said. "I live in 
fear of a terrible rainstorm." 
</P>
<P>
Every show has come together with few dramatic problems. And everyone involved 
agrees the shows, if nothing else, are getting better. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's growth show was truly a measure of how far the show has come in 
the last year. The crew only ran two of the planned tape segments because the 
interaction between the panelists and the audience was so good.

American Indian Museum: The Senate unanimously approved legislation Tuesday 
authorizing the Smithsonian Institution to establish a National Museum of the 
American Indian in Washington. The bill transfers a priceless collection of 
Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of the American Indian to the 
Smithsonian for display in a national museum on the Mall and in a satellite 
institution in New York City. Approval came on a voice vote, sending the bill 
to the White House for the President's signature. The House passed it on 
Monday. The measure may make peace among diverse factions, first by resolving a 
10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve the Heye 
Foundation collection of more than 1 million Indian artifacts. Secondly, it 
stipulates that the Smithsonian, where possible, return some 18,000 Indian 
remains to their original tribes for burial. ALEENE MacMINN

OUT OF JAPANESE FIRM'S BLUNDER CAME A LESSON AND CULTURAL BRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC RELATIONS: ITS 'LITTLE BLACK SAMBO' PRODUCTS CAUSED A FUROR IN THE U.S. 
BUT SANRIO REACTED ATYPICALLY AND SOUGHT OUT CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS TO HELP PATCH 
UP ITS IMAGE.

<P>
Immediately after the news hit that a Japanese company was selling Little Black 
Sambo beachwear and toys in Japan last year, Ron Wakabayashi began getting 
furious calls from blacks. 
</P>
<P>
One caller to the Japanese American Citizens League national headquarters in 
San Francisco threatened to circulate racist caricatures of Japanese. Others 
cursed the JACL national director and hung up. Nobody seemed to realize that 
Wakabayashi, a home-grown Angeleno, was not responsible for the actions of 
Japan -- the same kind of mistake that landed Japanese-Americans in internment 
camps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Fed up and fearful, Wakabayashi did something he'd never done before. He made a 
cold call to the firm, Sanrio Inc., and gave officials a piece of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
To his shock, the maker of "Hello Kitty" toys and other children's gifts did 
what was almost unimaginable for a Japanese firm. It swiftly responded. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began an unusual collaboration between a Japanese corporation and 
Japanese-American civil rights leaders. Stung in the past, many 
Japanese-Americans have been wary about identifying too closely with Japan, 
whose actions have occasionally brought them hostility from Americans unable to 
tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
But Wakabayashi and others, arguing that self-interest dictates involvement, 
have helped Sanrio launch a widely heralded program of corporate damage 
control. 
</P>
<P>
In a sharp departure from the more typical Japanese response to controversy -- 
duck and hide -- Sanrio is going well beyond apology. Prodded by the 
Asian-American activists, officials are directly tackling the problem of 
cultural ignorance through activities with the black community. The centerpiece 
is a Children's Day festival at Loyola Marymount University on Saturday to 
share Japanese culture with black children. 
</P>
<P>
"From that narrow self-interest -- I don't want people in the black community 
to take a punch at me or my kids -- it has expanded into something broader," 
said Wakabayashi, now vice president of public policy at United Way in Los 
Angeles. "It's a pioneering effort that most would consider very high risk." 
</P>
<P>
Sanrio, which maintains that it was unaware of Sambo's racist implications, has 
also commissioned a six-part series in its children's magazine, Strawberry 
Gazette, to teach Japanese youth about America's ethnic diversity. Company 
officials plan to invite several black children to Japan next year in a "little 
ambassadors" program. And the firm sponsored Christmas gift-giving programs in 
Los Angeles and Oakland last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a mistake, which was really ignorant," said Kurt Yonezawa, Sanrio 
executive vice president. "Since our main customers were children, we thought 
children would be the ones who could be educated to prevent this in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
People such as Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), who has tried for years to 
involve Japanese corporations in the black business sector, praise Sanrio's 
efforts. "They're the only ones who have responded, believe it or not. The 
other experiences have been horrible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to spread the lesson, the Japan Business Assn. of Southern California 
invited Yonezawa to hold a seminar on his program. The Carnegie Council asked 
him to join a panel, and an article on him in the Japan Economic Journal 
brought him instant celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
But all the whoop-de-do makes Yonezawa a tad nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood out too much," he said. "To do something new takes real fortitude. 
Japan is the kind of place where precedent is important." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wakabayashi and others say Sanrio was so receptive precisely because it 
is different from Japan's more well-known conglomerates. Family-owned and 
relatively small, Sanrio was founded in 1960 by a poet and novelist, Shintaro 
Tsuji, with the motto "Small gifts for big smiles." Employees are constantly 
lectured that Sanrio sells friendship, not merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
That soft sell, as well as the line of 10,000 children's items bearing 
wide-eyed characters, seems to work. Sales in Japan have steadily climbed to 
$661 million in fiscal year 1989 from $283 million in 1980. In the United 
States, sales reached $44.6 million this fiscal year, after a three-year 
reorganization that brought Sanrio's U.S. operation back from the brink of 
insolvency. Sanrio maintains 90 major accounts here and 13 direct outlets, 
called "Gift Gate," in such shopping malls as Beverly Center and South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
And Yonezawa, 44, is not exactly a typical Japanese executive. He was exposed 
to America's civil rights era as an exchange student at Stanford University in 
1967. He seriously considered moving to America after graduation -- to become a 
country-western singer. In fact, he has cut a record in Nashville, "Columbus 
Stockade Blues," whose cover pictures him in a cowboy hat. And no lifetime 
employment for him: Sanrio is the third company he has worked for. 
</P>
<P>
So when the news hit last July that Sanrio was marketing the Sambo items, the 
flood of ill will contradicted all the company strived to stand for. Yonezawa 
maintains that he did not know about the products in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanrio had already announced it would recall the products at a cost of 
$15 million, Yonezawa sensed there would be more fallout. 
</P>
<P>
There was. Wakabayashi's call brought news of the depth of anger among blacks, 
a planned meeting of the Black Congressional Caucus over the issue and the 
harmful impact on Japanese-Americans. But Wakabayashi also brought something 
more: an offer to help. 
</P>
<P>
Yonezawa's U.S. law firm had told him it could not help because it wasn't a 
legal matter. A U.S. public relations firm that he contacted advised issuing a 
public statement. He knew no Americans well enough to seek trusted advice. He 
knew no blacks. He had to consult his dictionary to learn what a congressional 
"caucus" was. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really frightening time. We were pulled into an unknown world," 
Yonezawa said. 
</P>
<P>
Wakabayashi introduced him to two other community leaders, Georgette Imura, 
Asian community liaison to Sen. David Roberti (D-Los Angeles), and Don Tamaki, 
a civil rights attorney in San Francisco. The Japanese-Americans possessed the 
perspective of racial minorities and some knowledge of Japanese culture, 
attributes they say led to the markedly different response. 
</P>
<P>
The group brainstormed more creative approaches. Wakabayashi suggested to 
Yonezawa the need for "the admission of ignorance, the apology and a response 
that would send a clear message that you're working on things to remedy the 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
Yonezawa agreed and got swift approval for the concept from Tsuji in Tokyo and 
his son, Kunihiko, who directs the U.S. operations. The Japanese-Americans also 
arranged meetings between Yonezawa and black political leaders Dymally, Rep. 
Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Mel Assagai, Roberti's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Yonezawa was so nervous before the Assagai meeting that he read 19 books in 
three days on U.S.-Japan relations, searching for just the right thing to say. 
He didn't find any wisdom, but Assagai said he was impressed by the sincerity, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Not all blacks are entirely satisfied, however. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel that "oh, that's nice, but what about giving black people jobs in 
their company?" said Karen Stokes, United Way's associate director of planning. 
"What we want to know is what Japanese-owned businesses in America are doing 
about the high unemployment rate. And do they have room for black people to 
move up in higher executive roles?" 
</P>
<P>
Among Sanrio's 200 American employees, six or seven are black, Yonezawa said. 
Only one is in management. Yonezawa said the firm's overall minority 
representation, including Hispanics and Asian-Americans, accounted for the 
staff majority, however. 
</P>
<P>
The collaboration has been a learning process for all parties. 
</P>
<P>
"To be very honest, my initial reaction was, 'Oh God, here we go again.' The 
Japanese-American community is always having to apologize for something that 
wasn't our fault," Imura said. "But after talking to Kurt, I realized . . . we 
were also stereotyping all Japanese companies and Japanese nationals who are in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Tamaki said he hopes that the Sanrio case will become a model for Japanese 
firms and an example of how Japanese-Americans can help serve as "cultural 
translators." 
</P>
<P>
"When this hit, there was a rush for Japanese-American leaders to condemn it, 
to distance themselves from it. I'm not saying that's wrong, but it's not 
enough to condemn," Tamaki said. "I think we have an inherent responsibility to 
offer assistance -- both because we're in a unique position to do so and 
because of self-preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Yonezawa does not want to posture his experience as a lesson for other Japanese 
firms. In fact, he said, it was acting against normal business interests that 
brought the program about. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I should be a Japanese before a Japanese businessman," Yonezawa 
said. "As a Japanese businessman, I can do nothing. If I do something which is 
risky, that may risk my future career. 
</P>
<P>
"But they influenced me to be a Japanese, to take this matter seriously not as 
a company problem but as a social problem."

HOW NIKE PLANS TO FOLLOW UP ITS 'BO KNOWS BASEBALL' TV AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Can Nike top Bo? 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone knows the "Bo Knows Baseball" TV commercial for Nike. It 
features dual sports star Bo Jackson testing his skills at everything from 
playing hockey with Wayne Gretzky to strumming guitar with Bo Diddley. On 
Tuesday, production crews were in Los Angeles filming Nike's follow-up ad that 
will premiere Jan. 28, during the Super Bowl telecast on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is in this commercial too. But the ad is not Bo II. This time, he not 
only shares the spotlight with the likes of Gretzky, Michael Jordan, Curtis 
Strange and John McEnroe, but also with some of the top-name broadcasters for 
each of their professional sports. Among these announcers are ABC's Al 
Michaels, CBS' Pat Summerall and Marv Albert of NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial -- which will be dotted with quick cuts from athletes to 
announcers -- will trace the combined flight of a baseball, football, 
basketball, golf ball, tennis ball and hockey puck. The ad, which will show 
each athlete at the peak of performance, will also show many of the stars at 
the height of their anger. McEnroe, for example, throws his racket to the 
ground in disgust. And Jordan argues heatedly with a referee. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, each of the sports announcers will say one word to complete 
the sentence "I have never, ever seen anything like it." Some observers say 
this "Just Do It" corporate ad for Nike may be one of the most complex, costly 
-- and entertaining -- sports commercials in years. 
</P>
<P>
"When something really great happens in a sport, everyone somehow becomes a 
part of it -- even the announcers," said Joe Pytka, who is directing the 
commercial for Nike, and who directed the popular "Bo Knows Baseball" ad. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the tennis portion of the commercial that features McEnroe 
was filmed at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. In an interview following the 
filming of his portion of the commercial, McEnroe admitted he's no Bo -- but he 
also said that Bo's no McEnroe, either. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, football is a much bigger sport. I can't fight against that," said 
McEnroe. "Sure, it can be frustrating, but I'm much better known in places like 
Europe, South America and Japan. In 10 years, I wonder how much they'll be 
saying about Bo." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a Nike billboard on Hollywood Boulevard that features a picture of 
McEnroe was replaced by an illustration of Bo Jackson -- stretching a bat 
behind a pair of shoulder pads that he is wearing. "My poster was on that spot 
for four or five years," said McEnroe. "But Bo's not a bad guy to be replaced 
by." 
</P>
<P>
With this campaign, Nike is clearly swinging for the fences. Nike officials 
will not reveal the cost of the latest ad, but advertising executives estimate 
that production costs alone could exceed $1 million. At the same time, 
broadcast media buyers say that 60 seconds of commercial time on this year's 
Super Bowl costs about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Super Bowl is the most important TV event there is," said Pytka, moments 
before filming McEnroe on the courts. Pytka estimates that he and his crew will 
spend 100 to 150 hours filming and editing this ad. "After all," posed Pytka, 
"What's bigger than the Super Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
Not much. In fact, the TV show with the most viewers in history was the 1986 
Super Bowl between Chicago and New England. Last year's Super Bowl had about 
110 million viewers. That's why a number of companies have already announced 
major campaigns that will break during the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Budweiser has already said it plans to broadcast the "Bud Bowl II" -- a series 
of animated ads that, for the second year in a row, will pit the Bud Light camp 
against the Budweiser brigade. Meanwhile, Miller Brewing Co. has signed "Night 
Court's" popular bald bailiff, Richard Moll, to appear in a series of ads with 
a Super Bowl theme for Miller Lite. Even Nissan has created a costly Super Bowl 
commercial that features a car being chased by a jet bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowl aside, Nike has plenty at stake with its latest campaign. Since the 
"Bo" ad campaign began, sales of Nike's "Cross Trainer" brand of shoes have 
rocketed. And one industry analyst recently projected in a trade publication 
that Nike will overtake Reebok in U.S. athletic footwear sales by the end of 
this year. While Reebok has continued to struggle to develop a consistent 
image, Nike has closely linked itself to a handful of the top-performing and 
best-known athletes in country. 
</P>
<P>
The writer who created the "Bo" campaign -- and who also wrote the Super Bowl 
ad -- said he is already feeling the pressure for his newest creation to be a 
success. "Everyone keeps asking me, 'How are you going to top the 'Bo' ad?' " 
said Jim Riswold, associate creative director at the Portland ad agency Wieden 
&amp; Kennedy. "If this one works out, I don't know how I'll top it. Maybe I'll 
become a monk."

IBM Unveils Advanced Disk Storage Unit: International Business Machines 
introduced a top-end disk drive that it called the fastest, largest-capacity 
mainframe disk storage device available. The 3390 Direct Access Storage Device 
was to have been unveiled July 25, but its release was postponed after IBM 
discovered some wear of the coating that covers its disks, which it said could 
have eventually led to data loss. IBM said the disk drive, which can do three 
times the work in one-third the space of previous units, will be available Dec. 
1. The machine will cost $90,000 to $275,000, depending on the model, with a 
typical configuration of three 3390 model 2 units priced at $759,000.

Hoylake Told to Disclose Takeover Terms: Arizona's director of insurance 
ordered Sir James Goldsmith's investment group to spell out what it plans to 
offer shareholders of BAT Industries of London even if it intends to sell BAT's 
Farmers Group insurance unit to Axa Midi Assurances of Paris. A scheduled 
hearing Dec. 4 on the proposed change of Farmers' ownership was canceled 
pending a new filing by Hoylake, which must win approvals of insurance 
regulators in the seven states, including California, where units of Los 
Angeles-based Farmers have their headquarters. Hoylake said it will file the 
information this week.

Boesky on Prison Furlough: Former Wall Street stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky 
was granted a temporary release from his three-year term at a California prison 
camp last Thursday, authorities reported. Boesky is due back at the 
minimum-security prison in Lompoc near the end of the month, said Ed Wolahan, 
the prison's supervisor of education. Boesky's attorney, Leon Silverman, 
declined to comment on the furlough. Wolahan said Boesky applied for the 
temporary release, which was approved by the prison warden. Wolahan said 
inmates who request furloughs must demonstrate a need for the release, but he 
wouldn't disclose Boesky's reasons. Boesky paid $100 million and agreed to 
plead guilty to one felony to settle charges three years ago in Wall Street's 
biggest insider trading scandal. He will be eligible for release in April.

Paramount to Take Charge: Paramount Communications Inc., which failed in its 
bid for Time Inc. last summer, said it will take a $140-million fourth-quarter 
pretax charge on its publishing operations, which include Simon &amp; Schuster, 
Prentice Hall and Pocket Books. The charge reflects a writedown in the value of 
some publishing assets and accruals for costs associated with improving 
publishing technology. Despite the charge, the company's overall results are 
expected to be sharply higher because of a previously announced a $1.2-billion 
after-tax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial finance business.

100 jobs, mostly in its headquarters office in Hartford, Conn., as part of a 
move to reduce sales of personal auto insurance in the face of a $53.9-million 
operating loss through September. The company intends to write 10% fewer of the 
policies in 1990 and 20% fewer over three years.

Great Northern Nekoosa Files Petition: Great Northern Nekoosa said it had filed 
a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission challenging an exemption 
granted last week to Georgia-Pacific so that it could take over Great 
Northern's railroads as part of a buyout. A Great Northern spokesman said 
Georgia-Pacific's exemption had been procedurally defective and contained false 
or misleading information. Earlier, Great Northern rejected Atlanta-based 
Georgia Pacific's unsolicited $58-a-share offer, calling it too low, possibly 
illegal and holding the potential for disastrous debt. Georgia-Pacific, 
maintaining that the offer is fair and sound, said it will pursue the 
transaction.

FARMERS SUE OVER SELL ORDER ON SOYBEANS

<P>
Family farmers who say they suffered severe financial losses from a Chicago 
Board of Trade order last summer filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday, 
accusing the exchange of illegally manipulating soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeking more than $100 million in damages was filed by individual 
farmers from leading soybean-producing states and the American Agriculture 
Movement, a lobbying group that represents small farmers and rural business 
people in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trade denied the allegations, which stem from its emergency action 
July 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The order caused a 20% drop in soybean prices and corresponding declines in 
other commodities, the AAM said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an alleged attempt 
to corner the market by Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, an Italian company and one of 
the world's largest soybean processors. 
</P>
<P>
"The CBOT's order was a bad faith and self-serving action initiated by the 
CBOT's dominant grain merchants and futures traders to create profits for their 
accounts and for their clients," said Harvey Joe Sanner, AAM's president and an 
Arkansas soybean farmer. 
</P>
<P>
Sanner spoke at news conference at a downtown hotel, accompanied by about 25 
other farmers from Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, 
Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas and South Dakota -- many of whom said they had been 
devastated by the board action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry as hell about what has been done to we as producers of this nation," 
said Corky Jones, a soybean farmer from Brownville, Neb., and an AAM member. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the order caused U.S. farmers "in excess of a $50 billion loss on 
corn and about $27 billion in beans." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names as defendants the exchange, BOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann and 
21 other directors, and with five other exchange officials.

NEW ECONOMIC REPORTS SEND DOW DOWN 16.18

<P>
Stock prices retreated in sluggish trading Tuesday amid uneasiness about the 
economy's weakness and pessimism about the chances for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 16.18 to 2,610.25. 
</P>
<P>
Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 639 up, 831 down and 498 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 143.17 million shares, little different from Monday's 
total of 140.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Several new reports underscored the economic slowdown, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
But the statistics didn't convey a completely clear picture, because they were 
influenced by special circumstances, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
A slumping automobile market helped drive down retail sales by a full 
percentage point in October, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial production was crimped during the month by a strike in the aircraft 
industry and the impact of the Bay Area Quake. The decline of 0.7% was the 
steepest in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Traders have been hoping that the Federal Reserve Board would spur growth by 
loosening its credit policy to a significant degree. So far, the central bank 
hasn't made any dramatic moves. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks of the Big Three auto makers sagged after the industry reported 
unexpected poor sales. Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks skidded 
20.2% in early November, compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors fell 3/4 to 43 3/8, Ford dropped 1/2 to 44 3/8 and Chrysler was 
off 1/8 to 20 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among heavily traded blue chips, food and tobacco company Philip Morris lost 1 
3/8 to 40 7/8 on word that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) plans to introduce 
a bill to bolster cigarette health warnings and sale restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Combustion Engineering led the Big Board's list of actively traded issues. It 
declined 3/8 to 38 5/8 as nearly 3.9 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among the actives, Merck pulled back 1/2 to 75 5/8, adding to 
Monday's loss of 3 7/8, which came on news that heavy research and sales costs 
would hurt earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei 225-share index gained slightly, bringing Tokyo stocks to a 
second straight record closing high, but prices suffered from inertia and 
stayed in a narrow range. The index firmed 18.52 to a closing high of 
35,768.64. 
</P>
<P>
London stocks closed firmer in quiet trading. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed up 1.5 at 2,214.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed, showing little reaction to the two government 
reports on the economy and an important Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term government bonds posted modest gains, while longer-term issues were 
unchanged to slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market, the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was 
unchanged from late Monday, with its yield holding at 7.88%. 
</P>
<P>
In the final phase of the governments quarterly refunding, yields on 30-year 
Treasury bonds fell in Tuesday's auction to the lowest level in nearly three 
years. The average yield was 7.87%, down from 8.14% at the last auction Aug. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Tuesday's bond auction, the refunding involved sales of $10 
billion of three-year notes last Thursday, $10 billion of 36-day cash 
management bills last Friday and $10 billion of 10-year notes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The auction was very good," said Douglas Schindewolf, a money market economist 
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "Surprisingly, it didn't have a big 
impact. (The market) just seemed to be able to hold its own." 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.438%, up from 8.375% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply against all key currencies while the West German mark 
continued to take center stage in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices, meanwhile, gained ground. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $393.30 an ounce, up $2.30 from late Monday. Republic National Bank 
of New York quoted a late bid of $392.50, $2.40 higher. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the continued signs of an economic slowdown in the United 
States helped depress the dollar by renewing speculation that the Federal 
Reserve would lower interest rates. A reduction in interest rates could hurt 
the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers, however, said that attention in the marketplace was again concentrated 
on cross trading as the mark continued to climb. They said the flood of East 
Germans into West Germany has raised the possibility of higher inflation in 
West Germany and higher interest rates there. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to 1.8540 marks from 1.8615 in London and to 1.8350 marks from 
1.8615 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed up 0.25 Japanese yen to 143.80 yen. It traded at 
144 yen in London and at 143.05 yen in New York, down from 143.925. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5810 
in London, up from $1.5805 late Monday. It traded at $1.5945 in New York, up 
from $1.5820. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of platinum futures climbed to six-month highs on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, extending a rally that has lifted the metal's value by 
more than 6% since Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been incredible," said Nina Lipton, research director for Platinum Guild 
International, a platinum trade association. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, gold and silver also advanced; cocoa futures plunged; 
energy, livestock and meat futures were lower, and grains and soybeans were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum futures settled $11.30 to $13.10 higher, with the contract for 
delivery in January at $525.70 an ounce, the highest price for a near-month 
contract since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum, like gold and silver, has risen sharply in value since Oct. 13, when 
a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial index sent nervous investors 
scrambling for the perceived safety of precious metals. January platinum 
settled at $491.60 on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures plunged to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; 
Cocoa Exchange on continued selling stemming from indications of greater 
availability of African-origin cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa settled $13 to $40 lower, with December at $941 per metric ton. 
</P>
<P>
Oil futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange, primarily because 
of large supplies of gasoline in New York harbor. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with 
December at $19.50 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to 0.31 cent lower, with 
December at 57.45 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.75 cent lower to 0.15 
cent higher, with December at 50.31 cents a gallon.

Mack Trucks Inc.: The Allentown, Pa., truck manufacturer reported a 
third-quarter net loss of $87.5 million, contrasted with a $2.7-million profit 
a year ago. Revenue fell 27% to $367.4 million. Mack said the results reflect 
the adverse effects of industrywide softness in the North American heavy-duty 
truck market and difficulties encountered with the introduction of its new 
products.

COMPROMISE WILL CAP S&amp;L BAILOUT SPENDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration and Congress averted a clash Tuesday over the rising 
cost of the savings and loan rescue operation by agreeing to delay any 
borrowing in excess of the $50 billion already approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill to curtail any new 
borrowing. But the measure won't take effect until Jan. 15, giving federal 
regulators time to find a borrowing plan that satisfies Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation approved in August to clean up scores of failed thrifts across the 
country gave regulators the authority to borrow funds, using as collateral real 
estate and other assets from failed S&amp;Ls seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
However, regulators shocked Congress by disclosing in recent weeks that they 
might need to borrow an additional $50 billion to $100 billion to close failed 
institutions. That would be on top of $50 billion in proposed bond sales 
already approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Congress fears that the unchecked borrowing capacity will give regulators 
massive sums of money to spend without effective legislative control. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with one of the largest scandals the U.S. has ever been 
involved in," said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.). Congress can "stand supinely by 
and let the Administration handle it" or take an active role in overseeing the 
spending of money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spending huge sums of money to close defunct S&amp;Ls "should smell and stink 
and hang out for everyone to see," said Gibbons. "I can see why the 
Administration does not want it to stink and hang out." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. (R-Ohio) said Congress wants the regulators "to 
come back with the least-cost solution" to the need for additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion already approved by Congress and a $5 billion line of credit 
available at the Treasury can be used to pay off S&amp;L depositors, whose 
accounts are insured by the federal government up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators already have seized control of 283 institutions and have identified 
223 more that are likely takeover candidates. They have not yet determined 
which institutions must be closed and which can be dismantled and partially 
saved by selling branches and deposits to healthy banks and S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the government will recover some of its outlays by selling assets 
from the seized institutions, including condominiums, shopping centers, 
apartment projects, office buildings and raw land. Estimates of the value of 
the seized assets range from $100 billion to more than $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The process of selling assets may take several years, and the regulators have 
said they will need billions of dollars in the short run to close failed 
institutions. They want to get the needed working capital by borrowing against 
S&amp;L assets. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal announced Tuesday, the regulators have agreed to refrain from 
borrowing additional funds before Jan. 15 while they try to devise a system 
that would satisfy Congress. The committee approved the bill by voice vote, but 
it will not be transmitted to the full House unless the compromise effort 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration will work over the next two months on developing a detailed 
working capital proposal," said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins said the Treasury opposed the bill 
but would accept the delay while a plan is being prepared. The Resolution Trust 
Corp., which is handling the closing and sale of S&amp;Ls, will not need 
additional working capital until April, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation over the issue likely will resume after January if the Ways 
and Means Committee does not accept the plan to be proposed by the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, lawmakers have warned that $50 billion to $100 billion in 
additional borrowings would be unacceptable without legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to me it's a veto prospect," said Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex). Any cap 
on spending would provide "a strong incentive to the Resolution Trust Corp. to 
dump assets to raise capital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they dump assets in our part of the world, Jake, we are in deep, deep 
trouble," Archer told Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), one of the key authors of the 
legislation forbidding additional borrowing. "What bothers me is that it's a 
tremendous threat to the underlying value of real estate in our state." 
</P>
<P>
Pickle said the Treasury had promised to come up with a plan to provide working 
capital, but had failed to deliver one despite repeated committee requests. 
</P>
<P>
Any borrowing should be controlled, with regulators coming back to Congress 
when they need more money, committee members indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill says, 'let's wait and see if we can do it cheaper,' " said Rep. 
Raymond McGrath (R-N.Y.). The Administration accepted the deal without 
enthusiasm. If additional funds must be borrowed directly by the Treasury, the 
deficit would be increased. "We are concerned that it can be used as a 
battering ram to eviscerate the Gramm-Rudman (deficit control) process," 
Assistant Treasury Secretary Mullins said in an interview after the Ways and 
Means meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Spending for the RTC would become the biggest single discretionary item in the 
budget and would be injected into partisan budget politics, Mullins said.

loss of $222.4 million in the same period a year ago. Revenue totaled $157 
million, down 29%. The Upper Saddle River, N.J., firm said the 1988 loss 
figures included $200 million in restructuring charges. The 1988 revenue 
numbers included income from operations since discontinued. Excluding those, 
the 1988 third-quarter revenue would have been $176 million.

FARWEST SAVINGS POSTS THIRD-QUARTER LOSS OF $22.9 MILLION

<P>
FarWest Savings said Tuesday that it lost $22.9 million in the third quarter 
because new federal rules required the thrift to revalue its junk bond 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the thrift will not be able to meet two of the three new S&amp;L 
capital requirements that take effect Dec. 7, FarWest's chief financial officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is a subsidiary of FarWest Financial Corp., controlled by the 
billionaire Belzberg brothers of Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The $22.9-million loss contrasts with a third-quarter profit of $1.5 million 
last year. For the first nine months, FarWest reported a $6.6-million loss, 
contrasted with a $6.3-million profit a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In its recent overhaul of rules regulating the thrift industry, Congress 
required that all junk bond investments be carried on an S&amp;L's books at 
current market values rather than at the purchase price.

Senate Authorizes American Indian Museum: The Senate unanimously approved 
legislation Tuesday authorizing the Smithsonian Institution to establish a 
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The bill transfers a 
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of the American 
Indian to the Smithsonian for display in a national museum on the Mall and in a 
satellite institution in New York City. Approval came on a voice vote, sending 
the bill to the White House for the President's signature. The House passed it 
on Monday. The measure may make peace among diverse factions, first by 
resolving a 10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve 
the Heye Foundation collection of more than 1 million Indian artifacts. 
Secondly, it stipulates that the Smithsonian, where possible, return some 
18,000 Indian remains to their original tribes for burial. ALEENE MacMINN

Fraud Alleged on 'Elm Street': A company involved in a partnership that 
financed the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films has filed a $15-million lawsuit in 
Los Angeles Superior Court against its partners, alleging breach of contract, 
fraud and breach of fiduciary responsibility. In the suit, Smart Egg Pictures 
S.A. accuses Heron Communications Inc. and New Line Cinema Corp. and several of 
its affiliated companies of breaking an agreement, fraud and breach of 
fiduciary responsibility for allegedly trying to "squeeze out" the company once 
they realized the success of the movies and their lead character, Freddy 
Krueger.ALEENE MacMINN

'Ghetto' Named London's Best Play: Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol's Holocaust 
drama "Ghetto" has been named London's best play of 1989 in the prestigious 
Evening Standard Drama Awards, presented annually by that London newspaper. 
"Ghetto," set in a Lithuanian ghetto in 1942, opened at London's 
state-subsidized Royal National Theater April 27 to near-unanimous raves and 
ran in repertory through Nov. 9. It played the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles 
in 1986 to mixed reviews before flopping on Broadway, closing after 33 
performances. Nicholas Hytner, the Englishman who staged "Ghetto" in London, 
was named the year's best director for both "Ghetto" and the recently opened 
hit musical "Miss Saigon." ALEENE MacMINN

PROFILES OF COURAGE IN AIDS DOCUMENTARY ON KCET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching "Living the Last Days," the latest documentary from the files of "KCET 
Journal" (at 8 tonight on Channel 28) recalls the story of Florence 
Nightingale. Like that great heroine, today's nurses and doctors who care for 
AIDS patients are performing a humane vigil, a deathwatch with tenderness. 
Then, the battlefront was Crimea; now, it is the Chris Brownlie Hospice, 
nestled in the hills of Elysian Park near downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The hospice was the brainchild of Brownlie and other AIDS-care activists who 
determined that there was a great need for a facility that cared for terminally 
ill patients without intensive medical and chemical treatments. For most of the 
hospice residents, the HIV virus has infected their central nervous systems; 
round-the-clock attention is a must. At the same time, as a staff member notes, 
"Hospice means that the residents have a say in their care." 
</P>
<P>
This results in the kind of humane hospital environment that the rest of the 
medical establishment can only dream about (daily charges are also 80% less 
than most hospitals). Writer-producer Nancy Salter visited the Brownlie hospice 
this past spring, and her cameras intimately observe a month in the life of the 
facility. It becomes a story of how individuals confront death with a panorama 
of responses, from passive acceptance to dogged refusal to give up. 
</P>
<P>
The mind can indeed will death on, as in the case of a teacher, who, one day, 
is conversing intelligently with the doctors, and then is soon peacefully near 
death. Robert Childs is willing to stare death down, on the other hand, and his 
case of determination to leave the hospice and go back to work at UCLA presents 
the hospice staff with an unprecedented challenge. With the luxury of a longer 
span of time than "48 Hours," Salter is able to follow the processes of not 
only death and acceptance, but the process of how a doctor learns from the 
patient when the patient has some say in his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Flawed only by some hearts-and-flowers music and camera angles that typify most 
films on AIDS, "Living the Last Days" ultimately memorializes some intensely 
courageous caregivers, who, Nightingale-like, tend to those close to the dying 
of the light.ROBERT KOEHLER

A 60-MINUTE COMMERCIAL FOR PAUL MCCARTNEY TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Didn't manage to snare tickets for Paul McCartney's upcoming five-night stand 
at the Forum? Depending on your penchant for jealousy, then, you may or may not 
want to watch "Paul McCartney: Put It There," a special on Showtime that 
basically plays like a tempting 60-minute commercial for the tour, as if it 
needed any more help selling tickets. It premiered Saturday and repeats today 
at 1:05 and 10:05 p.m. (and again Nov. 21, 22 and 26). 
</P>
<P>
This rockumentary, slavishly produced by McCartney's own company, is definitely 
for fans only. (And how many people do you know who aren't?) It's possible, but 
not easy, to pull an interesting interview out of McCartney, but whoever is 
doing the questioning behind the camera here hasn't pulled much new out of 
Macca; "John (Lennon) was such a monster -- it would certainly be hard to work 
with anyone better" is the level of personal insight here. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the weight of the show is with footage of the ex-Beatle's feisty new 
road band, which includes ex-Pretender Robbie McIntosh on guitar, rehearsing 
for the tour, and it does set the juices flowing. Few complete songs are found, 
but look and listen for lengthy snippets of favorites ranging from "Lucille" to 
"The Things We Said Today" to "Let It Be" to the special's title song, an 
acoustic choice from his latest solo album, which has the fade-out from the Fab 
Four's "Hello Goodbye" playfully tagged on the end. 
</P>
<P>
The most teasing bit is some home-video footage of Elvis Costello in the 
recording studio with McCartney, singing a rock 'n' roll rave-up version of one 
of the songs they co-wrote for his recent "Flowers in the Dirt" album, "My 
Brave Face." If only a bootleg of this complete rendition existed. Wishes, 
wishes . . . . 
</P>
<P>
A difference between this tour and the Stones' tour, for example, immediately 
becomes clear: Unlike Mick and the boys, whose set list you could've guessed 
without even showing up, McCartney wants to play songs from his current album, 
a heartening thought. And fans who don't have the "Flowers" LP, which includes 
some of his best work of the decade, may feel left out as he explains song 
after song from it. Which, this being a commercial, is part of the idea. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

EDELMAN WANTS END TO SECRECY IN LAND LEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to disclosures that Saudi Arabian businessmen and arms brokers 
secretly bought a major stake in leases on public land at Marina del Rey, Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman on Tuesday proposed that the county 
require that future investors in county-owned property be publicly identified. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, told his colleagues that he will 
propose adoption of a policy next week that would balance the public's right to 
know who is doing business on public land against the need to attract 
investment in county projects. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-month investigation, The Times reported in articles on Sunday and 
Monday that the Marina del Rey holdings were secretly purchased by a group of 
Middle Eastern investors headed by Khalid and Abdul Aziz Al-Ibrahim, 
billionaire brothers-in-law of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
The articles also reported that the supervisors approved the deal without 
attempting to learn the investors' identities. 
</P>
<P>
"We should try to work out a policy that will bring that information to the 
public," Edelman said Tuesday. "It's not like a private corporation. It's a 
public body, and the public is entitled to know. At the same time, we don't 
want to give up opportunities so the county loses money." 
</P>
<P>
The Ibrahim group, in a $21.8-million cash transaction, became partners with 
the marina's largest developer, Abraham M. Lurie, in three existing hotels, a 
planned luxury hotel, two apartment complexes, shops, offices, restaurants and 
more than 1,000 boat slips on 63 acres of county-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, the only supervisor who did not vote on the marina deal last summer, 
said he would have liked to have known the identities of the investors. 
</P>
<P>
But whether Edelman's proposed policy will be adopted is an open question. 
Rather than discussing the issue, two of the supervisors instead sharply 
criticized the Times' articles. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum accused the newspaper of being "completely off base." 
</P>
<P>
He said the supervisors were told by the county counsel's office that approval 
of the sale could not be unreasonably withheld. "That is the only 
recommendation" the board received from its lawyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich added that "the board's hands were basically tied" 
in approving the secret investors. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, however, the county counsel's office advised the Department of 
Beaches and Harbors, which oversees the marina, that the county could "just say 
no" to such a deal to protect itself in case the money being invested had been 
illegally obtained. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, authored by Frank Scott, principal deputy county counsel, 
warned that if "illegally obtained funds were used to finance the buyout" of 
marina property, the county's economic interest could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"Tainted money and those it touches could be the subject of criminal and civil 
lawsuits," the memo said. Such lawsuits could disrupt marina businesses, 
possibly reduce county revenues and make the property subject to seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the lease, "the county has the up-front power to protect 
itself from illegal financing of assignments," the memo said, adding that the 
lease "allows the county to just say 'no' to the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Department of Beaches and Harbors obtained additional legal advice 
from an outside law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, urging that 
the county obtain specific financial guarantees from the investors because it 
could be difficult for the county to pierce the veil of secrecy surrounding 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that advice, county officials did not examine the finances, nationality 
or background of the investors, nor did they require disclosures of their 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they relied on assurances from Chicago attorney Cornelius J. Sullivan 
that his clients, the investors, were successful foreign business people who 
were not involved in criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
No evidence has surfaced of any criminal taint on the marina investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
The deal gave the investors a 49.9% interest in the marina properties of Lurie, 
a major campaign contributor to the supervisors. If Lurie had sold more than 
50%, his marina leaseholds would have been reassessed for property tax 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the complexity of the deal and the desire of the investors to avoid 
taxation, the county assessor's office has begun a review of the transaction to 
determine whether the properties can be reassessed at market value.

'XERISCAPES' CATCHING ON -- IN FACT, SOME ARE GUSHING OVER THE IDEA

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Fleming bent down to rub some leaves from one of her short sage plants, 
leaving a mint-like scent on her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just smell that. In the morning and at night, with the dew, there's just a 
beautiful, beautiful aroma," Fleming said of the small garden surrounding her 
Belmont Shore home. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's garden is healthy and green and aromatic. Her plants have thrived 
despite the fact that the last time she watered them was on Labor Day, and the 
next time she waters will be June of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach resident has a "xeriscape," an increasingly popular type of 
garden that combines various landscaping principles aimed at conserving water. 
</P>
<P>
In Greek, the word xeros means dry. But that does not translate to a bunch of 
cacti, tumbleweeds and rocks, xeriscape enthusiasts quickly point out. 
</P>
<P>
In Fleming's garden, for example, there are drought-resistant plants with red, 
purple and blue flowers that need only occasional watering and are suited to 
the desert-like climate of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It is a concept that is catching on in cities such as Los Angeles and Santa 
Monica, where officials adopted xeriscape ordinances last year, and in Irvine 
and other parts of southern Orange County, where new developments feature 
better irrigation methods, mulches and plants that need less water. 
</P>
<P>
But in places such as Long Beach, city officials do little to educate people 
about the option of xeriscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some cities have done nothing at all," said Phil Hitchcock of the Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California. "Long Beach, for example, has no 
requirements that I'm aware of. I was not able to find anything for Anaheim and 
Fullerton, either. (Such cities) encourage low-water-use plants, but it's more 
lip service than a requirement." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ehren of the Long Beach Water Department acknowledged that "it's 
something we could do more of." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say that Long Beach is not doing anything," said Ehren, the 
department's safety and training officer. He noted that the city has an 
emergency water conservation plan that would go into effect in the event of a 
drought, and officials have also promoted water conservation in restaurants and 
through garden shows. In addition, the city has a xeriscape garden around its 
own Water Department building. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not through the city that Fleming learned of xeriscapes. Earlier 
this year, the retired schoolteacher received a visit -- and a lesson in water 
conservation -- from John Griffith, a former student who is now a wildlife 
biologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes absolutely no sense to plant anything that was not there to begin 
with," Griffith said from his home in Michigan. "Everything that happens in her 
native garden will keep everything under control." For example, fleas, ants and 
snails will stay away because they don't like to eat native California plants, 
Griffith explained. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have native plants, which are the pyramid of wildlife, you'll attract 
native animals, like butterflies and lizards and hummingbirds," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a xeriscape is to use landscape designs and plants that fit the 
natural environment. Using mulch, for example, keeps soil moist and reduces 
watering and evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
The right kind of sprinkler can also make a difference, said Hitchcock, the 
principal analyst in the water district's conservation management division. A 
drip or trickle irrigation system using narrow, porous tubes that slowly soak 
the plants' roots can cut water use by 20% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, about 50% of the average household's water bill is 
spent on outdoor watering. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is a finite source that will become increasingly expensive as we face 
droughts," said Jim Van Haun, a spokesman for the Municipal Water District of 
Orange County. Most of the xeriscape push in Orange County is toward the south, 
where most of the new development is taking place, Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, the primary importer of water for the county, has sponsored for 
the last eight years an annual xeriscape conference, which attracts several 
hundred landscape architects, contractors, irrigation specialists, gardeners 
and homeowners, according to a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where city officials adopted a comprehensive ordinance last 
year in hopes of conserving water, new developments must submit landscaping 
plans that meet a xeriscape point system, said John Stodder, the environmental 
affairs adviser to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Monica also adopted a xeriscape ordinance last year affecting 
new commercial and multifamily construction that includes landscaping. The new 
law limits lawn area to 20% of the landscaping, urges grouping plants with 
similar water needs together and calls for the use of water-conserving plants 
and efficient irrigation systems, said Atossa Soltani, the city's water 
conservation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Around Santa Monica City Hall there are three such gardens, which Soltani said 
cost no more to plant than a regular garden but save the city money in both 
water and maintenance. Several times a year, busloads of visitors gather at 
City Hall, then tour homes with xeriscape gardens in a city-sponsored program, 
Soltani said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Welsh, president-elect of the National Xeriscape Council, said he has not 
had to do much to promote the idea of planting gardens that save water and 
work. In 1978, there was only one educational program in the country promoting 
xeriscapes. Today, such programs exist in 36 states.

I used to be friends with the Berman-Waxman Machine. Now, they don't return my 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
When we were friends, there were lunches with the organization's political 
consultants, Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, and a warm welcome on election 
nights at their office, on the southern fringe of Beverly Hills, where 
political hot shots stop for something to eat and drink after the early evening 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Although the acronym for their firm is BAD Campaigns, in the pleasant glow 
produced by cold cuts, fruit, soft drinks and beer, BAD means good. Nowhere on 
the whole gossip-mad Westside are there better rumors or more cutting analyses 
of political personalities. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon at The Times, however, my editor handed me a copy of a memorandum 
someone had slipped to the newspaper. Written by Berman and D'Agostino, it 
contained tough-minded advice to Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on 
how to unseat Mayor Tom Bradley. It was "The BAD Memo," and the story I later 
wrote about its contents ended phone conversations with Berman and D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
This was definitely a loss. The Berman-Waxman Machine is a center of power. My 
mild dismay at being denied access reminded me of that. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, named for Democratic Reps. Howard Berman of Sherman Oaks and 
Henry Waxman of Los Angeles, dominates politics on the Westside and in San 
Fernando Valley communities on the hillsides and the flatlands around Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It's a strange sort of political machine, without the usual trappings of 
patronage and big bosses. These people can't even hand out a road-building 
contract. They don't need to. Waxman is the most powerful of the machine 
leaders. He is a short, bald man who, although most amiable to friends and 
family, doesn't smile much in public. A conversation with Waxman is no place 
for small talk. He can't stand superficial people. Give him the weighty issues 
of air pollution, foul water, AIDS research, generic drugs and adolescent 
pregnancies. But be prepared: If you engage him on those topics without 
preparation, you will be treated with a brusqueness just short of rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Berman and the other member of the leadership triumvirate, Rep. Mel 
Levine of Santa Monica, are more agreeable. Both are involved in issues as 
complex as Waxman's. But their affinity for difficult national issues has not 
lessened their enjoyment of low-down local politics. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the secret of their success. 
</P>
<P>
When most local politicians escape to Washington, they leave City Hall behind. 
Not this bunch. Mindful of the adage that all politics are local, the 
congressmen never forgot their base. 
</P>
<P>
They developed that base in the 1960s, when the WASP-dominated political life 
of Los Angeles was changing and the city was moving into an era of ethnic 
politics. The Waxman-Berman organization understood this change better than 
anyone else, and hit on what has become the singularly most effective way to 
exploit it. 
</P>
<P>
Their discovery was deceptively simple: Use computers to aim mailed advertising 
at individual neighborhoods, with messages targeted to each area's special 
problems. In predominantly Jewish areas, for example, the mailers often spoke 
of candidates' support of Israel. Democratic Party ties were emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
These expensive mailings were financed by campaign contributions raised with 
persistent requests from Waxman, who is one of the House's most powerful 
Democrats, and others associated with the organization. They started on the 
Westside and expanded into the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Their mailings helped elect Westside state legislators loyal to the 
organization. They backed Bradley when he was elected in 1973, although 
splitting with him later. Their man Rick Tuttle was elected Los Angeles city 
controller, although their candidate for city attorney was beaten by James 
Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will face one of its most challenging tests in 1993, when Los 
Angeles selects a mayor. With Bradley in decline, political leaders are already 
lining up for that faraway race. If the past is a guide, the Berman-Waxman 
group will be backing Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
The political arena has changed. Ethnic politics are more important in Los 
Angeles than they were when the Berman-Waxman organization began. Two Latino 
council members, Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina, may run, taking advantage 
of a growing Latino electoral base. Councilman Michael Woo is developing his 
Asian support. 
</P>
<P>
But, with its command of money and modern political communications, 
Berman-Waxman is the team to beat.

<P>
A woman who had just gone into labor Monday morning hailed a cab near MacArthur 
Park and gasped a one-word plea: "Hospital!" 
</P>
<P>
Maria Gonzales, 36, of Los Angeles then handed the cabbie a hospital 
registration card with the address for County-USC Medical Center, and the taxi 
sped off. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the cab reached the corner of 1st Street and Broadway downtown, 
however, driver Philip Gleason, 54, realized the baby was not going to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we'd never make it," he said. "I heard her moaning and groaning and . . 
. I knew he was coming up soon." 
</P>
<P>
He opened the door on Gonzales' side and positioned her legs so that they 
stretched out the door. Then he waved down a Los Angeles police officer. A 
California Highway Patrol officer also stopped to help. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boy came out fast. 
</P>
<P>
"He only took about two minutes," Gleason said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and the infant were transported to County-USC Medical Center where 
"they are both doing fine," said Adelaida De La Cerda, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
As the baby made his untimely debut, the taxi meter kept running. 
</P>
<P>
Gleason said the $14.30 fare was on him. JOHN H. LEE

WELL, THAT'S SKID ROW; 
</P>
<P>
2 HOMICIDES WITHIN 2 HOURS DRAW LITTLE ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Like the people living in Los Angeles' gang-infested neighborhoods, those who 
make their homes on downtown's Skid Row have slowly and tragically become 
inured to street violence. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the brutal slayings of two people within two blocks of each 
other the night before drew far less attention than the taping of an episode of 
the television show, "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
"It's always the same," said Randy Blankenship, 25, a wheelchair-bound man who 
heard the ambulances and police sirens wailing but thought nothing more of it. 
"That's street life." 
</P>
<P>
The first killing occurred at the northeast corner of 4th and Main streets at 
about 7:30 p.m. Monday when a man in his 40s was beaten and stabbed by four men 
who ran away. The man was taken to L.A. County-USC Medical Center, where he 
died of the stab wounds, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The second death came two hours later when a woman in her 30s was shot while 
standing near a ceramic figurine shop in the 200 block of East Winston Street, 
police said. Her attacker was described as a lone man with a gun. She also died 
at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Louis Trovato of the Central Division said police heard 
about the second slaying while they were still on the scene of the first. 
Trovato called the twin murders a "coincidence" but said such violence is not 
uncommon on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
The two murders brought to 38 the numbers of homicides reported in the Central 
Division so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those unfortunate things that happens," Trovato said. 
</P>
<P>
That same spirit prevailed the morning after on the garbage- and 
graffiti-strewn Skid Row streets where Elton Thomas has operated Tommy's 
Shoeshine for 18 years. "I don't pay it no attention," Thomas said of the 
violence. "Every now and then we have a little feud here, but it's nothing that 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Transients became especially vulnerable to attack in the mid-1970s when the 
so-called "Skid Row Slasher" was blamed for 11 murders. Skid Row workers blame 
the latest surge of violence, which started a couple of years ago, on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Imislund, director of the Midnight Mission on Los Angeles Street, said 
most transients accept that violence comes with the turf. "People don't talk 
about it much more," he said. "It's been said that no man is an island, but 
every man is an island here. I've talked to 20 people today, and no one has 
mentioned the two murders." 
</P>
<P>
On East Winston Street, just a block from where the second murder occurred, two 
groups of transients huddled on separate sides of the street. They said they 
have become more cautious at night, especially in choosing where they sleep. 
One man even said that he and a friend take turns looking out for each other. 
"He's my spotter," the transient said.

U.S. SENATE VOTES TO EXTEND TAX CREDITS ON HOUSING FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday to continue for six months tax credits for those 
who invest in affordable housing, thus improving the chance that Los Angeles 
might save at least some of the construction projects planned for 2,500 poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders had hoped for a permanent extension of the credit, which last year 
helped build 100,000 units of low-rent housing nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that it's better than nothing," Los Angeles Housing Authority 
Director Gary Squier said of the extension. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits still face a possible presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
The program gives investors tax credits equivalent to the amount invested in 
housing for the poor, spread over a 10-year period. The program helped create 
more than 15,000 units of low-income housing in California since it began less 
than three years ago, and has won wide popularity among banks, oil corporations 
and other profitable companies with large tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
If the tax credits are not extended beyond the Dec. 31 expiration date, a 
"devastating and immediate blow" would be dealt to low-income housing 
construction, city leaders in Los Angeles and elsewhere say. 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of the credit would "have the effect of a major earthquake, 
undermining the ground on which our housing is built," said Boston Mayor 
Raymond Flynn, who was part of a bipartisan group of mayors and other leaders 
who were in Washington Tuesday to lobby for the extension of the credits. 
</P>
<P>
The House had voted earlier to extend the tax credits indefinitely, attaching 
the measure to a deficit reduction bill. On the Senate side, the six-month 
extension was attached to a Poland aid bill Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp is a vigorous supporter of 
the tax credits. However, they remain threatened by a dispute between 
congressional Democrats and the Bush Administration -- a battle that has 
nothing to do with housing. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has so far held the tax credits hostage to his capital gains tax 
cut plan, which has been effectively killed for this year. Bush may kill the 
housing tax credits this year so he can use it as a bargaining chip next year 
when he again will pressure Democrats to approve his capital gains cut. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said the temporary extension of the tax credits "was portrayed to me as 
a way of ensuring a live hostage instead of a dead hostage to the capital gains 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
Half of Los Angeles' housing for very low-income families relies upon the tax 
credits, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about anticipated housing that could affect as many as 10,000 
poor individuals next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits are particularly important to Los Angeles because the city has 
the worst rental affordability crisis in the nation, with 300,000 low-income 
and working-class families paying rents considered unaffordable by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Los Angeles has an estimated 35,000 homeless people, second only to 
New York, which is estimated to have more than 70,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty arises as Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council are trying to 
adopt the city's first major package of affordable housing programs -- five 
years after most major U.S. cities took similar steps to fight worsening 
overcrowding and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits are essential to the city's efforts, already hurt by severely 
dwindling federal funds for housing during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said that a new public-private housing partnership 
proposed by Bradley relies on the tax credits for "the lion's share" of 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
The need in Los Angeles is evidenced by the overwhelming response of poor 
families whenever a low-rent building is completed with the help of tax credit 
financing, said Marilyn Katz, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit National Equity 
Fund, a financing pool for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-unit Marengo Apartments in East Los Angeles drew 400 applicants, she 
said. At Villa Park in Pasadena, 160 families applied for just nine units. 
</P>
<P>
While city leaders said an end to the credits would be devastating, they were 
not much encouraged by the prospect of a six-month extension. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callahan, founder of the Skid Row Housing Trust, said the extension "is 
just a drop in the bucket" compared to the permanent program they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wykoff, president and chief operating officer of Arco, said the tax credit 
measure is crucial in efforts to transform Los Angeles' notorious Skid Row into 
a "decent place to live." Arco is a major investor and corporate leader in 
housing for the poor here. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Wykoff said, tax credits made the financial difference that allowed 
the Skid Row Housing Trust to transform 10 grimy, crime-ridden hotels into 
low-income studio units. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan said her agency is involved in a five-year effort to turn 50 slum 
hotels into studio units for the homeless. It had been counting on $10 million 
to $15 million in tax credit financing in 1990 alone.

to this story.

$2 MILLION DISTRIBUTED FOR ADDED HOMELESS SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
More than $2 million in new grants to homeless shelters in Los Angeles County 
are being allocated to pay for 800 permanent emergency shelter beds in the 
region, state officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced the awards as part of 
an overall $5.8 million distributed as a result of Proposition 84, the 
emergency shelter bond measure passed by voters in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 1,800 people are being turned away from shelters every night," Roberti 
said at a press conference, referring to a recent study of shelters in Los 
Angeles County. "Today I am announcing one significant step toward the 
lessening of that crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The money will either preserve beds that would otherwise be lost due to funding 
shortages or create new ones, said Eugene Boutilier, administrator of the Los 
Angeles Emergency Food and Shelter Program Local Board, which selected the 12 
local grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"This will help pay for the permanent beds we desperately need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 6,400 emergency shelter beds in the county, Boutilier 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority of the city of Los Angeles is receiving a $200,000 grant 
to place 40 mobile homes out of 102 originally acquired by Mayor Tom Bradley 
two years ago to shelter the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The trailers became controversial when various community groups objected to 
having them in their neighborhoods, and by early this month only 61 had been 
placed. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 trailers, Boutilier said, will be placed on Century Freeway land and 
operated by the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Another recipient is West Hollywood, which has been operating a temporary 
shelter in West Hollywood Park where Roberti's press conference was held. The 
shelter's $216,000 grant will help complete a permanent 70-bed facility planned 
at 1033 N. La Brea Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The largest local grants, which amounted to $250,000 each, went to the Mary 
Lind Foundation, which operates three Los Angeles shelters treating homeless 
alcoholics and wants to acquire another 42-bed facility; Triangle Christian 
Services, a volunteer church organization expanding its shelter in 
South-Central Los Angeles, and Valley Shelter Inc., the largest shelter in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Shelter grant will create new beds for families at its North 
Hollywood facility, according to Nancy Bianconi, director of housing operations 
for the L.A. Family Housing Corp., which operates the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking five rooms and enlarging them to facilitate larger families," she 
said, "and some of our rooms need extensive renovation to keep up with health, 
building and safety standards. If we hadn't received that money, those rooms 
would have been closed down."

BOARD OKS BUDGET FOR COURTS ON DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday narrowly approved a 
$402-million budget for the county's Superior and Municipal courts, ending a 
last-minute showdown and clearing the way for $130 million in state aid. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum failed in his eleventh-hour drive to reject the 
budget as "fiscally irresponsible" when Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he had 
reached a private understanding with the presiding judge of the Superior Court, 
who pledged to hold down future costs. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1990-1991 budget for the Superior and Municipal courts countywide 
will jump about $60 million, or 17.5% to $402 million. Under the agreement 
approved by the supervisors on Tuesday, the county is required to pay about 
$185 million of the budget that takes effect on July 1. An additional $130 
million is provided by the state, and the remainder is raised from the courts' 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
If the board had rejected the budget, it would have lost the state funding. 
Under a state law, annual budgets for county courts must be approved by 
majorities of the Superior Court judges, Municipal Court judges and the Board 
of Supervisors by Nov. 15. Failure to act on the budget by that date means the 
county would have lost the $130 million in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be real dodos if we don't approve this today," said Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn in urging his colleagues to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were also urged by private attorneys to approve the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Hertzog, president-elect of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., warned the 
board that some of the reforms sought by Schabarum and Antonovich -- such as 
time limits on jury selection -- are beyond the board's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Hathaway, president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., said, "The court 
reforms you demand are far too serious to be used as mere political strings 
tied to the court's funding request." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said approving a budget that he perceived as bloated with perks for 
judges was "a complete abdication of this board's financial obligations." And, 
Schabarum warned, the courts' budget will continue to spiral in the future if 
the board did not take a stand this year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the benefits is a $350 monthly payment to Municipal Court judges for 
"professional enhancement" such as seminars, and a $600 annual payment to 
Superior Court judges for home and car security. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Ed Edelman called the budget a compromise and told Schabarum 
that the increases were "simply keeping pace with demands" on the system.

The Irish Republican Army apparently failed in an attempt to assassinate a 
British general who is second in command of land forces in Britain and Northern 
Ireland, police sources said in London. The target of the bombing was Lt. Gen. 
David Ramsbotham, 55, commander of the British Field Army and inspector general 
of the Territorial Army, the reserve force that had served in Northern Ireland. 
The sources said police defused a powerful bomb planted under a car near the 
general's front door in London's Kensington area after it was discovered by a 
passer-by.

The Pennsylvania state Senate gave final legislative approval to the most 
restrictive abortion legislation in the country, and Gov. Robert P. Casey has 
said he will sign it into law. Over the bitter objections of abortion rights 
advocates, the Senate voted 33 to 17 in favor of the measure, allowed under a 
Supreme Court decision in July that gave states wider control over abortion. 
The legislation, attached as a House amendment to a Senate crime bill, would 
bar an abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy, except to prevent irreparable 
harm or death of the mother. It would impose a 24-hour waiting period, require 
husbands to be notified of their wives' intentions to have abortions, eliminate 
abortions performed because of the fetus' sex and strictly control the use of 
fetal tissue for medical research.

A bill aimed at reforming the Department of Housing and Urban Development was 
passed by the House on a voice vote and sent to the Senate. The bill requires 
that consultants and lobbyists register with HUD, disclose whom they work for 
and report their fees. Grant recipients would have to report any use of 
lobbyists or consultants. The measure creates financial watchdogs for the 
department and the Federal Housing Administration, revises the FHA mortgage 
program and prohibits loans for second homes. It curbs the program of subsidies 
for renovating low-income housing that is at the heart of the current probe of 
influence peddling. Earlier, a panel had stripped from the bill a provision for 
a major overhaul of federal housing programs.

The lone elected black on Miami's City Commission won overwhelming support from 
black voters and defeated his Cuban-born challenger in runoff elections. With 
all 86 precincts reporting, Miller Dawkins, 64, a two-term incumbent, had 
18,245 votes, or 52.7%, to 16,402 votes, or 47.3%, for Joe Carollo. Totals from 
ethnic-dominated precincts in this racially tense city showed Dawkins, an 
administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, carrying nearly 99% of the black 
vote and 75% of the Anglo vote. Carollo carried the Latino vote with 78%. 
Dawkins had said he did not believe his was "the black seat" on the commission 
but he also said the city's blacks -- who make up about 30% of the voters -- 
deserved representation on the body. Carollo, 34, a former commissioner, ran 
Spanish-language ads saying that "all the Cubans vote for Carollo."

Weather forecasters said there is no relief in sight for the conditions that 
have caused a heavy layer of smog over the San Joaquin Valley in recent days. 
Warm, stagnant air over the valley the last week has combined with the 
extensive use of fossil fuels to increase smog to the unhealthful level. "The 
lack of wind causes an inversion layer that keeps everything packed in and 
gives it no chance to escape," said Katie Bearden, county air quality planner. 
"The air quality index levels have ranged between 90 and 100 for the past 
week." Levels between 90 and 100 are considered unhealthful by county 
officials.

San Francisco Police Chief Frank Jordan has forced his older brother, Deputy 
Chief Jack Jordan, to retire after allegations that the deputy chief tried to 
conceal an alleged police beating of United Farm Workers union co-founder 
Dolores Huerta. The union leader was severely beaten during a demonstration 
against then-Vice President George Bush during a campaign stop in San Francisco 
last year. The deputy chief had been accused of authorizing the removal of a 
document from the personnel file of an officer accused of beating Huerta. With 
his retirement, Jack Jordan will no longer face administrative charges before 
the city's Police Commission.

PADRES' DAVIS IS RELIEVED TO WIN CY YOUNG AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE'S ONLY THE FOURTH RELIEVER AND JUST THE THIRD SAN DIEGO PITCHER TO 
WIN THE HONOR IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.

<P>
There were times when Padre reliever Mark Davis hurt so bad he didn't know if 
he could pitch. There were even occasions when he just didn't feel like coming 
to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
How can you care about baseball, Davis asked, when your father's dying of 
cancer? 
</P>
<P>
Now you can understand why the moment Davis was informed Tuesday afternoon that 
he won the 1989 National League Cy Young Award, his eyes burned with tears. 
</P>
<P>
He shared the moment with his wife, Candy, and then picked up the telephone and 
made a call to his parent's home in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, mom, how's dad feeling today. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, tell him I just won the Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
"And mom, tell him how much I love him." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis, Mark's father, was unable to come to the telephone. He's 
critically ill with prostate cancer, and this was not one of his good days, 
Davis' mother said. He was too weak to come to the telephone, Jane Davis said, 
but as soon as he was up to it, she'd tell him the news. 
</P>
<P>
"The award means a lot to me, don't get me wrong," Davis said, "but more than 
anything, I wanted this for my father. He's been talking about it for a while, 
and I'm just so happy I was able to come through for him." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' eyes then began to tear. He bit his lip. He stopped momentarily, and 
regained his composure. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who share in this award for me," Davis said, "but it's 
just that my father has seen me ever since I put my first glove on. It's nice 
for him to be here, or at least close by to know what's happening. It makes it 
very, very special." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who saved a Padre-record 44 games, won the award by the largest margin 
of victory by a National League reliever in the 34-year history of the Cy Young 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, only the fourth National League reliever to win the award -- Steve 
Bedrosian (1987), Bruce Sutter (1979), and Mike Marshall (1974) are the others 
-- received 19 first-place votes from the 24-member panel of the Baseball 
Writers Assn. of America, getting 107 total points. Starter Mike Scott of the 
Houston Astros was second with three first-place votes and 65 points. Chicago 
Cub starter Greg Maddux received 17 points for third. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Orel Hershiser received the only other first-place vote, and 
finished in a tie for fourth with starter Joe Magrane of the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The only ballot Davis did not appear on was that of Dennis Arcand of the La 
Presse newspaper in Montreal. Arcand cast his first-place ballot for Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Davis saved 44 games in 48 opportunities. He was successful in 26 of his last 
27 save situations, blowing just one save after June 24. 
</P>
<P>
His 44 saves were the second-highest total by a National League reliever, and 
two saves shy of equaling Dave Righetti's major-league record of 46 saves in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there the year Righetti had those saves," said Padre starter Dennis 
Rasmussen, "and I'm telling you that their two seasons don't even compare. He 
(Davis) was just phenomenal this year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre starter Ed Whitson: "He's the best I've ever seen. I mean, the 
absolute best. No starter likes to come out of a game, but when you're handing 
the ball over to him, turn out the lights because this ballgame is over." 
</P>
<P>
"The only guy I've ever seen that can compare is Goose Gossage, and that's some 
fine company right there." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Padres, it's now anyone's guess whether Davis will again 
be pitching for them. Davis is a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his wife reiterated once again Tuesday that this is where they want 
to be, but what once appeared to be simple negotiations have turned into an 
open bidding war. The Padres' last offer to Davis was a three-year guaranteed 
contract for about $6 million, but agent Alan Hendricks began listening to 
other offers Monday. About 14 teams have expressed interest in Davis, and the 
Seattle Mariners already have made an offer. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things will go into the decision," Davis said, "but today, I feel 
this is a happy time for the Padres and myself and I would like to focus on 
that. I don't want to dampen this day." 
</P>
<P>
It indeed was a celebratory day for Davis, but for the Padres, well, it was a 
rather uncomfortable feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Padre owner Joan Kroc sent her private plane to pick up Davis and his wife from 
their home in Scottsdale, Ariz. for the press conference at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, and the entire Padre contingent was on hand to congratulate 
him. But yet, with Davis standing behind the podium and thanking the 
organization and all of his teammates, the Padre front office could only stand 
by and wonder if he'll be wearing a different uniform the next time they see 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be nuts if I wasn't concerned," said Padre Manager Jack McKeon, who never 
before had a Cy Young winner on his staff. "I would like to see him pitch for 
us again, but it's not my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Padres' Chicago-based attorney who's handling the Davis 
negotiations, also attended the press conference Tuesday, but had no update on 
the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is his day," Lane said. "All I'm here to do is congratulate him. This is 
his time, not contract time." 
</P>
<P>
The going rate for top-quality starters this winter such as free-agent Mark 
Langston and pitcher Bret Saberhagen of the Kansas City Royals -- who's 
expected to win the American League Cy Young Award today -- figures to be 
starting around $8.5 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at what he's done for our ballclub, and what he's done around 
the league," McKeon said, "who knows how much that's worth. All I can tell you 
is that he did everything we asked for our team. He's a leader. He's a proven 
closer. And he's a complete team player. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a guy like that around makes managing a whole lot easier."

KINGS GET VICTORY AT CALGARY, 8-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After blowing another lead, after battling back and then, finally, holding on 
for an 8-6 victory over Calgary Tuesday night, the Kings could only breathe a 
sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Good, bad, even ugly. Whatever. They needed a victory over the Flames. Here or 
there. Didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"After losing 10 straight, we were just saying to ourselves, we've got to start 
beating this team," said Marty McSorley, who was playing right wing when he 
scored the goal that gave the Kings the upper hand to start the third period at 
the Olympic Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the Stanley Cup. They won our division. This is the team we have to 
beat. We have to beat them during the regular season if we want to have a 
chance to beat them in the playoffs. We have to believe that we can beat them. 
At 10 straight, we knew we had to start beating this team now." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 straight included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two games earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calgary's sweep of four playoff games last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calgary's four victories over the Kings toward the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
It starts to get a little humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
But one big victory works wonders for the ol' ego. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary is still leading the Smythe Division with a record of 10-7-4. But the 
Kings are starting their comeback in the standings, too, moving into a tie for 
second place with a record of 9-10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, who had four assists, was left to analyze just how fast the 
Kings are closing in on his archrivals of today and yesterday. Just three 
games' difference in the loss column. That's not much to make up. And, as 
Gretzky pointed out, "We feel we've got a pretty good team here." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Kings are starting to feel like themselves again after back-to-back 
victories over Montreal and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Gosselin has been in goal for both of the victories, getting the nod 
ahead of goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster said he had chosen Gosselin, on both occasions, because of 
his records with those teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked his record against Montreal and I checked his record here in 
Calgary," Webster said. "he's lost some games here, but he's played well. In 
the last two games, he's come up with a couple of good wins for us." 
</P>
<P>
In both of those "good wins," the Kings blew 4-1 leads in the second period. 
Saturday night, after letting Montreal come back to tie, 4-4, the Kings pulled 
out a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Flames scored four in a row to take a 5-4 lead, but the Kings came 
back with three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work that way last Wednesday. In that game at the Forum, the Kings 
also blew a 4-1 second-period lead, but lost, 5-4, to Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had been afraid the 4-1 scenario would play out the same way it had 
the last time against the Flames, Webster said: "I wasn't going to let it 
happen. I wasn't going to allow it." 
</P>
<P>
The coach also said that it was his job to keep the team in the game and the 
players focused. And he managed it, although there were a couple of lapses, 
such as when Ken Baumgartner took a two-minute penalty for elbowing that led 
directly to a Flames' power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the Kings were on top of their game, forcing the play. It 
was Webster's plan to set the aggressive offensive pace. In the long run, it 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will take on all comers in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
As McSorley said: "You can't say we're not an exciting team." 
</P>
<P>
Only 3 minutes 40 seconds into the game, Calgary's Doug Gilmour beat Gosselin 
on a breakaway. But the Kings came back to score four in a row -- by Bernie 
Nicholls on a rebound to tie it at 6:08, by Mike Allison on a deflection at 
9:57, by Steve Kasper off a rebound from the boards at 19:00 and by John 
Tonelli, a power play goal on a net left wide open while goalie Rick Wamsley 
went to try to gather in a puck. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, in the second period the Flames came back. They scored four 
straight to regain the lead at 10:05 of the second. Gary Suter started the 
comeback with a shot high over Gosselin's glove at 4:38. Sergei Makarov poked 
the rebound of a shot by Gary Roberts into the right corner of the net 1 minute 
21 seconds later. And less than two minutes after that, Joe Nieuwendyk tied the 
game, standing in front of Gosselin to receive the pass from Suter on the power 
play. Theoren Fleury gave the Flames the lead, then, after taking the centering 
pass from Makarov on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
The next goal -- the one by Luc Robitaille less than a minute later that tied 
the game at 5-5 -- was the goal that did in Wamsley. He was pulled in favor of 
Mike Vernon at 10:51 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley saw his chance to jump on a loose puck early in the third period and 
he and took it to give the Kings a 6-5 lead. Larry Robinson's second goal of 
the season gave the Kings a 7-5 lead after Robinson passed to Gretzky in the 
left corner, took it back from Gretzky and put it past Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp pulled Vernon at 18:47 and the Flames got a 
six-on-five goal from Joey Mullen at 19:01. 
</P>
<P>
But Kasper scored on the Flames' empty net at 19:17 to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had not won at the Saddledome since April of 1988. They lost all four 
regular-season games at the Saddledome last season and then lost two playoff 
games here. . . . Calgary's loss to the Kings Tuesday night was their third 
straight. Calgary did not lose three straight games all last season. . . . 
Defenseman Petr Prajsler got tangled up with Calgary's Joel Otto and went down 
in a heap during the first period, suffering a sprained left knee. He was sent 
home to Los Angeles to see doctors. . . . Keith Crowder played at Calgary 
Tuesday night after missing 10 games with a cervical strain. . . . Brian 
Benning made his first appearance in a King uniform.

8 WORLD CUP BERTHS SETTLED TODAY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight berths in soccer's World Cup finals will be at stake today, when 14 
European nations end 18 months of qualifying matches with their final games. 
</P>
<P>
The various possibilities are mind-boggling in Groups 1 and 4, where four of 
Europe's strongest soccer nations are vying for three places. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark, one point ahead of Romania in Group 1, travels to Bucharest for a 
deciding match. In Group 4, the Netherlands, one point ahead of West Germany, 
plays host to Finland, while the West Germans face Wales. 
</P>
<P>
As in all groups, the leaders in Groups 1 and 4 automatically go to the final 
round. But only one of the runners-up will advance. 
</P>
<P>
Group 3 provides the most fascinating scenario. Four of the five nations in the 
group are making one last effort to grab two berths. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviets beat or tie Turkey in the Ukraine, they will win the group title 
and advance. The Turks also will advance with a tie if Austria and East Germany 
tie in a game in Vienna. A victory by either of those two would eliminate 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
In Group 5, a tie for the Scots at home against Norway would send them to the 
finals along with group winner Yugoslavia. But defeat for the Scots in Glasgow 
would let in France, provided it beats Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal can join Group 7 champion Belgium in the finals only if it beats 
Czechoslovakia by four goals in Lisbon. Otherwise, Czechoslovakia will be the 
qualifying runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland has possibly the easiest task of all as it bids for a place in the 
finals for the first time. The Irish travel to Malta needing just a tie to join 
Group 6 champion Spain.

<P>
With no advance word or publicity about the game and no fans, the United States 
played a surprise soccer match against Bermuda Tuesday and won, 2-1, as Hugo 
Perez returned to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, preparing for Sunday's World Cup qualifier at Trinidad and 
Tobago, got second-half goals from John Doyle and Eric Eichmann to take a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who tore a groin muscle on Sept. 29 while playing for Red Star 96 of the 
French second division, missed the last two World Cup qualifiers, both 
scoreless ties. Perez, a 26-year-old midfielder from San Diego who was born in 
El Salvador, is considered the most creative offensive player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
The United States (4-3-3 in 1989), is 3-1-3 in World Cup qualifying, tied for 
second place with Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago would advance in the 
event of a tie against the United States because of a better goal differential.

It would have taken Martina Navratilova longer to list her health problems and 
injuries than it did for her to defeat Mary Joe Fernandez Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeded second, lost only 11 points on her serve during a 6-2, 6-3 
victory before 11,185 fans in the $1-million Virginia Slims Championships at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad considering that Navratilova had to default last week in the 
quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims of Chicago because of a groin pull she 
suffered during a fall on ice two weeks ago -- a "serious goalie split," she 
called it. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova also had a bout with the flu that has still left her sniffling. And 
she says she continues to feel the effects of a nagging pulled stomach muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of the three has been lethal," she said before her first match 
in the year-end championships that she has won five of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
But on the court, only Navratilova's serve-and-volley game seemed lethal. She 
won 41 of 59 points when she came to net. She never seemed in danger of losing, 
and even held three break points to go up 5-2 and serve for the match in the 
second set before Fernandez made one last stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one of the better matches she's played," said Fernandez of her 
six losses to Navratilova. "She was just really sharp at the net and she moved 
really well. She certainly didn't look like she was feeling too bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest concern coming in was the groin and that didn't hurt at all," 
Navratilova said. "I'm still feeling the effects of the head cold, but even 
though my head is stuffed, I'm still seeing the ball clearly. If anything, I 
was overrunning the ball because I was so eager to get to the net." 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, fifth-seeded Zina Garrison defeated Canada's 
Helen Kelesi, 6-3, 6-1, and seventh-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia 
eliminated Raffaella Reggi of Italy, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the Garrison-Kelesi match, speed was clearly the overriding factor; Garrison 
had it, Kelesi didn't. Garrison is one of the fastest players on the tour, 
continually able to run down shots that are seemingly out of her reach. 
</P>
<P>
Kelesi was often wrong-footed and continually found herself on the losing end 
of a well-placed drop shots. Even Kelesi's powerful groundstrokes were 
neutralized when Garrison came to net and knocked off winning volleys. 
</P>
<P>
"Her balls are really more bark than bite," Garrison said. "It's just because 
she takes the ball early that it looks so hard. I think she hits the same as 
most of the girls." 
</P>
<P>
Kelesi, who earned enough points to qualify for the championships by playing 
tournaments in five consecutive weeks, said she was tired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for me to concentrate and focus," she said. "I'm just ready to go 
home and rest for the rest of the year."

CLIPPERS RUN, GUN DOWN THE NUGGETS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: DENVER FALTERS IN FOURTH QUARTER FOR FIFTH LOSS IN EIGHT GAMES 
AT SPORTS ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Up and down the court they went, the Clippers and Denver Nuggets, proving to be 
marathon men for lasting all game at such a pace. 
</P>
<P>
How much run-and-gun? It was 102-92 . . . at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
All that remained was to prepare the oxygen masks and decide a winner. The 
Clippers got the better of both ends, claiming a 129-121 victory before a crowd 
of 6,125 and making Denver still feel like it's playing in rarified air at the 
Sports Arena, where the Nuggets have lost in five of their last eight 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
As they had in Saturday's heart-breaking loss to New York, the Clippers came 
back from a double-digit deficit to stage a late charge. This time, though, 
they didn't lose. 
</P>
<P>
Their first lead since the second quarter came at 117-116 on Tom Garrick's 
layup with 3:27 to play. A second straight Clipper fast-break basket, when Ken 
Norman got the layin and free throw, made it 120-116, a cushion they would not 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
That was part of a 10-2 run, the key to the Clippers, who trailed by 13 points 
on several occasions in the third quarter, breaking a three-game losing streak 
and improving to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets are 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Always up-tempo Denver led after two quarters, 69-63, but at the same time 
pulled the Clippers to their highest-scoring half of the season. Gary Grant had 
13 points on six-of-nine shooting, and Charles Smith 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, looking to break a two-game losing streak at the Sports Arena, had 
to be especially happy with the big numbers. They shot a horrendous 37.3% (38 
of 102) in a 122-108 loss Saturday at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
They went 54.3% in the first 24 minutes against the Clippers, with Blair 
Rasmussen hitting seven of 10 for 17 points and Michael Adams five of nine for 
another 17. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Adams' scoring came in typical style -- three-point shots. The 
NBA's single-season record holder in long-range launches was three of five in 
the first half, and he also had five assists, more than any player. 
</P>
<P>
Denver broke the 100-point barrier with 1:08 to play in the third quarter on 
Fat Lever's basket and subsequent free throw. The Nuggets led, 102-92, heading 
into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two days ahead of schedule, and much to the surprise of his teammates, Danny 
Manning took part on his first full-scale workout Monday. "I just wanted to go 
out and play," he said. "I can't get much stronger in two days." Manning 
wouldn't rate his performance, but the Clippers were glad to. "He looked good," 
Ken Norman said. "He hasn't lost anything. He really picked up the practice 
with his enthusiasm and hustle." So good he could be activated soon? "I don't 
know why he's not dressing tonight," Norman said before the game. The reviews 
have been so good that it is conceivable Manning, who tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament in his right knee Jan. 4 and underwent reconstructive surgery 
10 days later, could be playing as soon as next week. He wouldn't go that far, 
committing only to continued practices with the Clippers and plans to join them 
for a two-game trip to Texas beginning today. "My only goal was that when I 
came back, I wanted to play hard," he said. "I think I accomplished that." But 
not all was well with the player who holds so much of the key to the Clipper 
success. Tuesday, he had a killer toothache. 
</P>
<P>
We've seen this before, but both sides in the Benoit Benjamin negotiations 
agree to a noticeable warming trend, so much so that chances are better than 
ever the free agent center may sign today. The holdup, as always, remains the 
Clippers' insistence on incentive bonuses versus Benjamin's demand for 
guaranteed money, with a base salary of $1 million currently for 1989-90 on the 
table. Charles Grantham, the chief of the players' union who is making a tour 
of NBA camps, has acted as something of a mediator/prodder during his stop in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Former Laker David Rivers was signed Tuesday, taking the place of Andre Turner, 
cut the day before. Minnesota claimed Rivers in the expansion draft, but the 
Timberwolves cut him recently. "It's sort of nice to be anywhere," he said. 
"But to come back here (Los Angeles) is a bit nicer because this was my first 
birthplace into the NBA." Rivers will wear uniform No.4.

Status quo: Don't expect UCLA to make wholesale changes in its offense before 
Saturday's game against USC at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real hard defense to move on," Coach Terry Donahue said of a Trojan 
unit that ranks fourth in the nation, "but I'm not sure in four days you can 
come up with anything that's going to have a dynamic impact. What you have to 
do is try to assess your own situation and see what you can do best and then 
kind of go in and do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that we could do anything that 10 other teams haven't tried. 
Football generally isn't what what you do, but how you do it. That's one of our 
biggest difficulties. We aren't a football team that's executing very well." 
</P>
<P>
Stack 'em up: One thing that will change this week, according to several Bruin 
seniors, is the coaching staff's approach to practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more like a full scrimmage," linebacker Craig Davis said of past UCLA 
workouts in the week before the USC game. "Normally, you're not supposed to 
take a back to the ground. You're supposed to hold him up. During the week of 
the SC game, if you smash somebody, that's a good thing. If there's a pile of 
bodies, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Student-athlete: Offensive lineman Rick Meyer, a biology major, has been 
nominated for an NCAA postgraduate scholarship and academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Closing in: Kirk Maggio remains second in the nation with an average of 45.66 
yards per punt after averaging 49.3 yards in three punts last Saturday against 
Oregon. Colorado's Tom Rouen leads the nation with an average of 46.09 yards.

NEWSWIRE: 20 EAST GERMAN COACHES CONTACT WEST GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty East German national sports coaches have contacted the West German 
Olympic Committee in the past two days to announce they are in West Germany and 
want to coach that nation's teams, the president of the West German Olympic 
Committee said Tuesday in an interview with the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Willy Daume, who organized the 1972 Munich Olympics and is leading the effort 
to hold the 2004 Olympic Games in Berlin, said the coaches include "some names 
that are very famous in the East German sports world. These are the very best, 
from nearly every sport, including football (soccer), cycling, wrestling and 
weightlifting." 
</P>
<P>
Daume said the West Germans are not seeking defectors from the vaunted East 
German sports machine, but will nonetheless welcome the coaches and find them 
coaching positions immediately.

A federal jury returned a verdict in favor of the University of Nebraska in the 
case of an academic adviser who sued the school and top officials, claiming she 
was fired in September, 1988, for investigating the records of student 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of four men and three women decided for Dr. Donald Gregory, university 
general studies supervisor, and James Griesen, university vice chancellor, in 
the suit filed by Mary Jane Visser, a 19-year employee. 
</P>
<P>
Thom Cope, Visser's attorney, said he is still considering his options but 
noted that he is waiting for an expected ruling by U.S. District Judge Warren 
K. Urbom, who presided over the case, on the sex discrimination part of the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The jury decided against her claim of sex discrimination under Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act, but that part of the verdict was advisory and not binding on 
any decision the judge might make.

FISH REPORT: NO END IN SIGHT FOR RAINBOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the Colorado River at Bullhead City, Ariz., Larry Cozad of Smitty's says, 
"I don't know how long it will last, but we're having a lot of fun catching 
rainbows." 
</P>
<P>
Anglers drifting Power Bait or gold bluefox lures are having the most success. 
For a change of pace, some three-pound striped bass are showing up in the early 
morning near the dam. 
</P>
<P>
BIG BEAR LAKE -- Trout fishing as good "as it's gonna get," Lin Crawford 
reports, but not many anglers. Trollers using flashers with night crawlers, or 
swimming minnows, to get their attention. Few catfish on Power Bait while 
fishing for trout. Bass fishing fading for winter. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Trout highly active, running from 3/4-pound to three pounds. 
For stripers, try the lake in early morning in dam area, with white sassy shad 
and chrome rattletraps. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Corvina biting best between state park headquarters and Salt 
Creek, 4-6-pound average, using talapia minnows or trolling with thin fins. Big 
bite of sargo is consistent throughout Sea. Croaker at Bombay Beach. 
Temperatures mid-80s during day, low 50s at night. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Red-ear perch jumping by Johnson Bay, with night crawlers. 
Catfish continuing to come in -- one 12 1/2 pounds -- on cut mackerel. Trout 
planted twice last week. Some limits from shore on Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Ron Morgan, Lake of The Woods, caught and released 15-pound 
striper, using Zara spook in the marina. Smallmouth bass stirring. Tom Thomas, 
San Fernando, caught three on night crawlers at Serrano. Crappie also starting 
on mini-jigs and meal worms. Fishing picking up as water temperature drops. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Lake turning over from bass to trout as water cools. Anglers 
trolling lead-core line, three to four colors deep, using red and rainbow 
needlefish. Stillfishing good with Power Bait. A few bass up to 1 3/4 pounds. A 
few catfish up to six pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Michael Calloway, Pacoima, 9 1/2-pound catfish on meal worm. 
Bass deep. Steve Tate and Dennis Taylor, West Hills, limited 10 bass in 65 feet 
of water on plastic worms, released alive. Tony Marik, Little Rock, 11 
1/2-pound catfish, on cut mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout good off west shore for trolling and by dam at Sierra 
Cove, using blown-up nightcrawlers, Power Nugget-mealworm combo, salmon eggs, 
gold and silver Kastmasters, frog grain rooster tails and bumblebee rooster 
tails. Sal Mennuti, Irvine, 9 1/4-pound trout on night crawler. Rudy Benton, 
Orange, seven-pound sturgeon, on shrimp from boat near flats. Anglers releasing 
sturgeon will receive free fishing pass for conservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SKINNER -- Catfish coming along, using shrimp, all over lake. Trout in 
shallower waters, on Power Bait and night crawlers. Some bass coming to live 
worms in north end in reeds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- In a lull, but one 35-pound striper in Cleghorn reported, no 
name. Crappie good around marina on a morning bite, with bullet jigs, clear and 
smoke sparkle, chartreuse. Several largemouth 4-5 pounds caught and released on 
jigs in channel. George Nelson, San Bernardino, 12 1/2-pound catfish on 
anchovie in channel. Frank Roski, Yucca, five-pound largemouth on rubber trout 
near dam. Mike Lemieux, Canyon Country, 60 crappie using bullet jigs. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- The 5,000 trout planted last week showing up along shoreline. 
Many limits, on Power Bait or Zeke's. Catfish good on mackerel, in 50 feet of 
water. Pat Brixey, Ventura, 13 1/2-pound cat, on mackerel. Bass slow. Trout 
fishermen trolling lead-core line and needlefish lures by dam picking up spring 
planters.

MCANALLY SEEKS THIRD STRAIGHT TRAINING TITLE

<P>
The pressure is on Ron McAnally, who will be attempting to win his third 
straight Southland training championship at the Hollywood Park meeting starting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of pressure I don't need," said McAnally with a grin as he closed up 
shop at Santa Anita Tuesday. "But we'll give them a try. We've got five (horses 
entered on) opening day." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Frankel was the last trainer to put three local titles together, winning 
the Oak Tree and Hollywood Park meetings at the end of 1981, then taking the 
1981-82 Santa Anita winter meeting. More recently, Mike Mitchell won the 1983 
Del Mar and Oak Tree meetings but finished in a tie with Laz Barrera at the top 
of the '83 Hollywood winter standings. 
</P>

After taking this year's Del Mar and Oak Tree titles with a well-balanced barn 
headed by Bayakoa, Hawkster, Warning Zone, In Extremis and the popular white 
horse, Flippable, McAnally will try to get off to a fast start at Hollywood. He 
leaves Saturday for Tokyo, where he will prepare Hawkster for the Japan Cup on 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Cup offers $1 million to the winner, but of more immediate concern to 
McAnally is today's ninth race, in which he will send out a 2-year-old colt 
named Silver Ending, who cost just $1,500 as a yearling. Silver Ending races 
for McAnally's wife, Debbie, and their longtime friend Angelo Costanza. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always heard that wives are the worst owners for trainers to have," said 
Debbie McAnally on the eve of the race. "So I've worked hard to be very quiet 
about the colt and keep my excitement inside. It's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending, by Silver Hawk out of a daughter of 1969 turf champion Hawaii, 
will be making his grass debut after his maiden victory last time out. Silver 
Hawk also sired Hawkster, who is undefeated in four starts on grass. 
</P>
<P>
The opening-day feature at Hollywood will be the 6 1/2-furlong Moccasin Stakes 
for 2-year-old fillies. Bel's Starlet and Dramatic Joy are the "now" horses in 
the field of eight. But chances are all eyes will be on Leonard Lavin's roan 
rocket, Ten K. 
</P>
<P>
When last sighted, Ten K was finishing a distant eighth to Rue de Palm in the 
Del Mar Debutante on Sept. 3, her first loss after two exciting wins. She was 
favored that day at even-money. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't have run her in the 
Debutante," trainer W.L. Proctor said shortly after the race. "That was her 
third race in a month, and she just wasn't ready for it mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, last winter's leading jockey, will be back aboard Ten K. Eddie 
Delahoussaye will return on Dramatic Joy, and Robbie Davis will ride Bel's 
Starlet again. The rest of the Moccasin field includes Owiseone, Nasers Pride, 
Puppet Show, A Wild Ride and Interlope. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park will be open five days a week, Wednesday through Sunday, with 
the first post at 1 p.m. On Thanksgiving, Nov. 23, the first race will be at 11 
a.m., and on closing day, Dec. 24, it will be at noon. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million Hollywood Futurity on Dec. 17 headlines the stakes schedule. 
Other noteworthy events include the $500,000 Hollywood Starlet Dec. 3 and the 
$500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly telecast of race replays will be shown on KDOC (56) at 8 and on 
Prime Ticket at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
New additions for this meeting include a third $3 triple bet, several "sports 
centers" for television viewing and at least a ton of bricks in the garden 
areas behind the main grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he still has 41 days to serve on a 60-day suspension for a positive 
cocaine test, jockey Patrick Valenzuela has begun laying the groundwork for his 
return to competition when the Santa Anita winter meeting opens on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was out early Tuesday at Santa Anita, working horses for such 
trainers as Bruce Headley, Donn Luby and Darrell Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great," Valenzuela said later. "People seem really concerned about me. 
I was honest with them all and told them I was doing what I had to do. That's 
the main thing -- honesty. The rest will fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is barred from attending the races or entering the stable area of 
the host meeting, Valenzuela is allowed free access to off-site training 
facilities, such as Santa Anita or Fairplex Park, during the Hollywood Park 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela received his suspension after a urine sample taken Oct. 20 tested 
positive for cocaine. As a result, he lost the mount on Sunday Silence, who 
went on to win the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I watched the Breeders' Cup on television," Valenzuela said. "And I hurt 
inside because I wasn't there. But I almost cried for joy because the horse 
deserved to win so much. People kept knocking him and knocking him, saying he 
wasn't as good as Easy Goer. As far as I'm concerned, he might be the best 
horse that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela confirmed that he is continuing with drug and alcohol abuse programs 
and that he and his wife, Jeanna, had separated. They have three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela also said he had "gained a few pounds" since his suspension began. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it right now, though," he added. "With about 40 days to 
go, I've got plenty of time to get my weight down. The thing now is to stay fit 
and convince people I mean business. The future looks bright." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Figs Form, the daily handicapping publication that set itself up as an 
alternative to the Daily Racing Form, has folded after a run of only eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Pranke, who broke down in Monday's Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, remains in 
stable condition at trainer Eddie Gregson's Santa Anita barn. The Argentine 
horse ruptured the suspensory ligaments of his left ankle and has been fitted 
with a splint that shifts the weight to the toe. "He won't be entirely out of 
the woods for another 24 hours," Gregson said Tuesday. "With the increased 
blood flow to the injury, there's always the danger of a high white count and 
possibly colitis." 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner Arthur Hancock, on Sunday Silence's knee injury: "Compared to the 
other things he's lived through, this is no big deal. Still, I'll sleep better 
when the operation is over." The colt survived a severe intestinal virus as a 
weanling and a van accident at age 2. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Juvenile Championship winner Magical Mile, who suffered a hairline 
fracture in a knee last July, should be back in serious training soon. Trainer 
Warren Stute reported that the undefeated son of J.O. Tobin has just completed 
three weeks of aqua-tread therapy.

CONSUMER VIEWS: LOTTERY AUDITED HEAVILY AND OFTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Your earlier column about the California Lottery was excellent, but a 
great number of Lottery players (since the beginning) are starting to harbor 
some suspicions concerning the handling of the monies taken in and disbursed by 
Lottery officials. Does anybody audit their activities and is there a regularly 
published report? If so, where and how can we get a copy of it? If there is no 
published information, would you take this on as a project? I think the public 
is entitled to detailed knowledge of their activities. 
</P>
<P>
L.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If auditors were termites, the California Lottery building in 
Sacramento would be under a perpetual extermination tent. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, are we ever audited!" is the reaction of Joanne McNabb, the Lottery's 
communications manager. "You wouldn't believe it." The curious structure of any 
state's lottery makes it a natural for far more auditing than a comparable 
private business would require or, for that matter, tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
"While it's like a private business in many ways, since it is selling a 
product," McNabb says, "it's also a public entity, so there's a real need for 
extra-thorough auditing." The Lottery has its own independent auditing 
department, which periodically moves in without warning and audits the books of 
all units handling the Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, McNabb said, the State Controller's office maintains a 
permanent staff of 16 auditors "right here in our building, and the Lottery 
pays all of the salaries and other expenses involved in the activity." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, auditing the entire operation on a quarterly and annual basis is 
the national accountancy firm of Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"And," McNabb says, "of course, anyone who wants a copy of the latest statement 
can get one from us at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Just write to: Public Affairs Office, California State Lottery, 600 N. 10th 
St., Sacramento 95814. You can expedite this by including a magazine-size 
manila envelope.

SCREEN STYLE / HIPPIE REVIVAL

<P>
The Movie: "Drugstore Cowboy" 
</P>
<P>
The Setup: Actors Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch (pictured above), James Le Gros and 
Heather Graham are caught in a downhill slide caused by pharmaceutical drug 
abuse combined with drugstore thefts in Portland, Ore., in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Rather than play up the psychedelic colors and outrageous silhouettes 
of the era (remember elephant-leg pants?) costume designer Beatrix Aruna 
Pasztor chose somber simplicity for these flower children gone to seed. She 
explains: "I looked for shirts with long pointed collars," the type Sonny Bono 
used to wear. Key pieces in various characters wardrobes are the thigh-length, 
double-breasted velvet coat that Lynch wears, a pair of plaid bell bottoms for 
Matt Dillon, and the roughed up suede hat worn by Heather Graham. These items 
irrevocably lock the movie into its time slot. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: Fortunately for designers and manufacturers of the 
not-always-flattering vintage fashions in the movie, the names on labels have 
faded with time and wear. "It wasn't so tasteful a period," Pasztor says about 
dressing in the age of longhairs. She found her best buys scrounging through 
sales racks at Salvation Army stores as well as second-hand shops in Portland, 
instead of resale shops. Avoiding bastions of antique chic definitely helped 
her modest costume budget. Pasztor claims that all of her second-hand purchases 
were priced under $10. 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Goodwill Industries and Salvation Army in the San Fernando Valley, 
as well as second-hand shops in Portland, provided the basics. When pressed to 
find specifics, such as a white stretch lace shirt Lynch wears over a black 
bra, Pasztor headed to Eric &amp; Co. on Melrose Avenue. The store carries 
up-to-the-minute renditions of late '60s styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Adaptation: For anyone interested in hippie fashion revival (as plenty of 
European designers seem to be, judging from recent collections by Giorgio 
Armani, among others) Pasztor recommends shopping second-hand thrift stores. In 
particular, look for velvet jackets, wild-patterned vests and bell-bottom 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: There is something very appealing about the way bell bottoms look 
in this film. They serve as a very effective balancing factor for broad hips, 
as do shoulder pads, which seem to be losing position, after a decade of 
dominance in the fashion scene. With pads on the way out, maybe it's time to 
reconsider those ankle-slapping pants. GAILE ROBINSON

AN ELOQUENT DEFENSE FOR THE STUDY OF HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Historical Literacy: The Case for History in American Education, edited by Paul 
Gagnon and the Bradley Commission on History in Schools (Macmillan: $22.50, 320 
pages.) 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 survey of 17-year-olds in America revealed that two-thirds did not know 
that the Civil War took place in the last half of the 19th Century. Seventy 
percent did not know that "Jim Crow" laws were intended to enforce racial 
segregation. And 30% could not find Great Britain on a map of Europe. The sad 
conclusion is that Americans are mostly ignorant about their own history. 
</P>
<P>
Historical ignorance is the problem that caught the attention of the Bradley 
Commission on History in American Schools, one of those worthy blue-ribbon 
commissions that deliver themselves of voluminous but mostly unread tomes. 
</P>
<P>
But "Historical Literacy," the official report of the Bradley Commission, 
deserves a better fate. In 17 essays by about 25 American educators and 
historians, "Historical Literacy" offers an eloquent argument in favor of the 
study of history as a discipline that serves democracy and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
As contributors Kenneth T. Jackson and Barbara B. Jackson point out, the 
history curriculum in the American classroom was one of the early victims of 
the educational turmoil of the '60s and '70s -- they bemoan the " 
'Balkanization' of the history curriculum" and the resulting "do-your-own-thing 
formlessness of social studies." 
</P>
<P>
And, according to the late Hazel W. Hertzberg, the failures of public education 
have been reinforced by American television, the "omnipresent educator" that is 
specifically anti-historical: "Television is, I believe, destructive not only 
of our sense of history but of the democratic process itself." 
</P>
<P>
A centerpiece essay by Diane Ravitch, professor of history and education at 
Columbia, calls our attention to the academic torpor that currently afflicts 
the study of history in American schools, where the substance of history is 
sacrificed for a kind of earnest but soft-headed game-playing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she reports on one exercise in an American studies class where 
the students broke up into groups of 10 to deliberate on the Dred Scott case 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten minutes later, no surprise, each little Supreme Court recommended that 
Dred Scott should be a free man, and the class ended," Ravitch writes. "They 
did not learn why Chief Justice Roger B. Taney decided otherwise, nor did they 
learn the significance of the Dred Scott decision in the antislavery agitation, 
nor its importance as a precursor to the Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Bradley Commission, the task is to restore history to its 
proper place in the education of American children. Each of the contributors to 
"Historical Literacy" argues for the beauty, the utility and the transcendent 
social and political importance of history. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA, cites the 
successes of a pilot program that introduces young schoolchildren to the 
Odyssey and the Aeneid, and calls for "a curriculum that returns to classrooms 
the pleasures of stories worth telling, of ideas worth pursuing, of adventures 
that capture and hold children's attention and lead them into the historical 
perspectives that help each find his or her place in the long sweep of human 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Why study history at all? At its heart, "Historical Literacy" is a magnificent 
attempt to answer that question, in all its complexity. 
</P>
<P>
And the most readable and memorable essays -- including, notably, a short 
memoir by Stanford historian Gordon A. Craig on "History as a Humanistic 
Disciple" -- transcend the workaday business of the Bradley Commission. They 
are elegant testimonials to the uses of history as a source of inspiration and 
enlightenment, democratic values and social progress. 
</P>
<P>
But I came back to Diane Ravitch's essay, where I found the most stirring reply 
to the rhetorical question. Indeed, her words are a credo for every student and 
teacher of history and deserve to be chiseled in stone (or, more to the point, 
painted on stucco) in every school and university in America: 
</P>
<P>
"Properly taught, history teaches the pursuit of truth and understanding; it 
establishes a context of human life in a particular time and place, relating 
art, literature, philosophy, law, architecture, language, government, economics 
and social life; it portrays the great achievements and terrible disasters of 
the human race; it awakens youngsters to the universality of the human 
experience as well as to the particularities that distinguish cultures and 
societies from one another; it encourages the development of intelligence, 
civility, and a sense of perspective," Ravitch reminds us. 
</P>
<P>
"These are values and virtues that are gained through the study of history, 
values and virtues essential to the free individual exercising freedom of mind. 
Beyond these, history needs no further justification."

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A TEST FOR YOUR VIEWS ON FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are you a fitness buff? How much do you know about exercise -- what it will and 
won't do for you? Here's a chance to test your views with those of some 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
1) The more you exercise the healthier you'll be and the better your sex life 
will be. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
2) Those who start regular aerobic exercise programs usually stick with it 
because they enjoy it so much. T( ) FALSE( ) 
</P>
<P>
3) Most of your close friends, your lover or your spouse can be expected to 
support your exercise program wholeheartedly. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
4) There's a hormonal link between exercise and sexual desire. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
5) Older people who exercise regularly have no better sex life than the couch 
potatoes who don't. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
6) There are no cases of people being addicted to exercise. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
7) People in low-level jobs don't need exercise programs as much as executives 
because they have less stress at work. T( ) F( ) 
</P>
<P>
Answers: 
</P>
<P>
1) False. There's a limit to everything, and moderation is the key. For both 
men and women, extremely rigorous exercise diminishes sexual desire. If you 
constantly exhaust yourself, you simply don't have the energy for sex. 
</P>
<P>
2) False. While most people seem to enjoy aerobic exercise, half of those who 
start such a regimen drop out within the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
3) False. Surprisingly, this isn't always the case, according to psychologist 
Kenneth Matheny who found that the inactive partner often sets up subtle 
roadblocks or creates situations in which the partner must choose between the 
relationship and exercise. Some friends, lovers and spouses are threatened by 
exercisers' improved appearance and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
4) False. This hasn't been proven. Psychosocial factors are probably much more 
important. When people feel better about themselves, when their self-esteem and 
self-confidence grows, so does their libido. 
</P>
<P>
5) False. A study of swimmers conducted by anthropologist Phillip Whitten 
revealed that those in their 60s were nearly as sexually active as those in 
their 40s, and those in their 40s had intercourse about as often as those in 
their 20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
6) False. Apparently, some people do become addicted to exercise, especially to 
running. As with other addicts, they begin to use exercise as a way to escape 
all their problems. 
</P>
<P>
7) False. They probably need exercise even more than high-level workers because 
they have more stress on the job. Those who have less control at work seem to 
suffer from stress more and may be more susceptible to heart disease as a 
result.

JAILHOUSE BLUES: As officials continue to dicker over where to put a new county 
jail (B1), the jail population keeps on climbing. . . . In late 1986, when 
supervisors first approved a feasibility study for a jail in Gypsum Canyon, the 
jail system's population had never exceeded 3,500. Recently the county jails 
hit a new population high of 4,482, well above the listed capacity of 3,199.

FITNESS: Orange County children aren't just out of shape (A1). . . . According 
to the UCI researchers who tested Irvine fourth-graders this year, a third have 
more cholesterol in their blood than is safe, and 8% have levels so high they 
exceed adult safety guidelines. Since cholesterol levels usually rise in 
adulthood, the doctors say, many of these children are in for high heart-attack 
risk unless their diets are changed soon. . . . In New Orleans, meanwhile, the 
nation's top heart organizations Tuesday denounced the "myth" that the 
cholesterol scare has been overblown, reiterating that Americans should cut 
down on saturated fat and cholesterol to minimize the risk of heart disease.

STUDY PLANNED OF REGIONAL JAIL ON DESERT SITE 
</P>

Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth on Tuesday got the qualified support of 
his colleagues to launch an in-depth study of the feasibility of joining in the 
construction and operation of a large regional jail in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, a regional jail proposed for a remote desert area 50 miles east of 
Palm Springs would eliminate the need to build a new jail now scheduled for 
construction in Gypsum Canyon, which Roth opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Roger R. Stanton, who voted in August for the 
Gypsum Canyon site near Anaheim Hills, said they still support that location. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember a time when I gave a speech . . . when the jail issue didn't 
come up and people would say, 'Why don't you put it in the desert?' " said 
Stanton, whose district is concentrated in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While Stanton said he would continue to support his prior vote designating 
Gypsum Canyon for a 6,720-bed jail, he also urged the board to seriously study 
the desert site proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just put our heads in the sand . . . ," he said. "This proposal is 
worthy of support. I want to commend you . . . if this happens to pan out, 
congratulations to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Supervisor Patricia (Corky) Larson said Tuesday that under the 
proposed regional plan, Orange County would pay to build the facility and 
Riverside County would lease space in the jail for its prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said a preliminary study has indicated that the jail could be built in the 
desert at a savings of up to $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, who attended Tuesday's supervisors' meeting on 
another issue, said outside the Santa Ana hearing room that the county has 
spent more than $7 million so far on the Gypsum Canyon site. If the supervisors 
change course now, he said, that money would be lost and it could mean years 
more in delays in constructing a badly needed new jail. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said other studies have rejected the idea of a desert jail as being too 
expensive and "too hard to get to," adding that the proposed site in eastern 
Riverside County would be a four-hour drive from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
One of the studies cited by Gates -- a 1987 study of jail needs by the state 
Corrections Advisory Committee -- only briefly discussed regional jails, 
calling them "impractical" because in many cases it would "create 
insurmountable transportation problems and increased personnel costs" for those 
financially responsible for the regional facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This (Roth's proposal) will not save money in the long run," Gates said, 
adding that the real cost of a jail was not the construction and the land, but 
the cost to operate it year after year. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Gates contended, jail overcrowding and crime are the county's 
problems. Like the problems regarding sites for trash dumps and airports, they 
must be solved by the county and not put in someone else's back yard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors, after struggling for years to decide on a site for a new 
jail, chose the Gypsum Canyon location on a 3-2 vote in July, 1987. The board 
majority reaffirmed that controversial decision last August when it voted 3 to 
2 to approve an environmental impact report on Gypsum Canyon. Supervisors Roth 
and Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes the Gypsum Canyon area, have cast 
the dissenting votes. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Anaheim, Yorba Linda and Corona have filed suit challenging the 
environmental study as flawed. And Taxpayers for a Centralized Jail, a group 
that includes residents of both Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda, has qualified an 
initiative for the June, 1990, ballot that is aimed at preventing the jail's 
construction in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
As for the regional plan, Riverside County Supervisor Larson said in a 
telephone interview Tuesday that no specific site has been chosen, although 
early discussion has centered on an area southwest of Eagle Mountain in eastern 
Riverside County. Larson said the mayor of Blythe last weekend asked her "not 
to rule out" his city as a possible site. She added that towns in Riverside 
County and elsewhere in California want jails because they provide much-needed 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Riverside County has just completed a new jail and expanded others, 
Larson said the county needs more jail space. She said they remain under a 
Superior Court order to reduce overcrowding in county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), a former mayor of Anaheim who has gone on 
record opposing the Gypsum Canyon site, said he supported Roth's proposal for a 
regional jail and would back legislation in Sacramento, and possibly an effort 
to get state construction funds, if they were needed. He said problems such as 
who would control the facility still would have to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting in Santa Ana, board members were provided with a letter 
supporting the regional jail study by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was in 
Europe attending a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is in a crisis," wrote Wieder, who with Riley and Stanton has 
voted for the Gypsum Canyon site. "Jail overcrowding, along with court 
mandates, has resulted in the early release program being implemented." 
</P>
<P>
That overcrowding has resulted in what is known as the "revolving door" where 
suspected criminals are booked, then immediately released, she said, adding "I 
have grave concerns about this action." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason and others, she wrote, "I am extremely anxious to explore every 
possibility of building a maximum security jail facility to adequately address 
the needs of Orange County citizens. I would like to commend Supervisor Don 
Roth for his foresight and initiative in seeking information on alternatives 
that will help expedite this very immediate crisis." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks before the board, Roth said his proposal offers "a new dialogue on 
criminal justice facilities which may allow Orange County and its surrounding 
counties to work together on a problem that crosses county borders." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, the county's short-term jail expansion efforts have 
resulted in litigation and no new beds. Long-term jail expansion efforts, he 
noted, are "meeting with strong neighborhood opposition, a divided board, and 
litigation which may effectively delay or block efforts to build the Gypsum 
Canyon jail." 
</P>
<P>
And that conflict, he said, may "impair" the county's ability to win voter 
approval sometime next year of a proposed half-cent sales tax increase to 
finance criminal justice projects, including the $700-million Gypsum Canyon 
jail.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KILLER OF COLLEGE COUPLE SENTENCED TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South-Central Los Angeles man convicted of the execution-style murders of a 
UCLA freshman and her boyfriend in a secluded field in the Santa Monica 
Mountains more than four years ago was sentenced Tuesday to die in the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Leslie W. Light imposed the sentence on 
Stanley Bernard Davis, 27, who was convicted of murdering UCLA freshman 
Michelle Ann Boyd, 19, and Cal State Northridge sophomore Brian Edward Harris, 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss said Davis was one of four men who abducted the 
couple, sweethearts since they were classmates at Thousand Oaks High School, in 
Westwood on Sept. 30, 1985, and drove them to a darkened spot off Mulholland 
Drive, where he shot them.

MCHUGH SLAYER GETS 30 YEARS TO LIFE

An airplane mechanic was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison Tuesday for 
murdering a Garden Grove grocery store clerk who got lost on her way to Santa 
Ynez to help friends who had car trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Herdman, 34, of Lompoc killed Stephanie McHugh, 20, with one rifle 
shot to the head on July 7, 1988, as she sat in her car on a darkened road, 
reading a map to get her bearings. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Maria Superior Court Judge James Jennings imposed a mandatory term of 25 
years to life for Herdman's first-degree murder conviction and another 
mandatory, consecutive five-year term because he fired a gun into an inhabited 
vehicle, according to Bob H. Betzendorfer, a deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Betzendorfer said that when Herdman was permitted to speak before his 
sentencing, he insisted he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who volunteered many hours to work with handicapped children and 
the elderly, was on her way to help friends who had bought her car. She had 
promised that if anything went wrong with the car, she would drive up and help. 
When she heard that the auto had broken down, she set out for Santa Ynez about 
7 p.m., as soon as she finished her shift at a Garden Grove supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Near Buellton, McHugh became lost and stopped on the shoulder of California 154 
to consult a map. A man in a pickup truck pulled up alongside her and fired one 
shot into her car. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman was arrested the next day, based on a witness's description of his 
truck and the suspicions of a sheriff's deputy who had questioned Herdman a few 
hours before the shooting when he appeared to be drunk outside a local bar.

COUNCIL TO DONATE $2,000 FOR GRAD-NITE 
</P>

<P>
The City Council has agreed to donate $2,000 to the Cypress High School 
Grad-Nite committee. 
</P>
<P>
The June 20 event is aimed at keeping graduating seniors off the streets and 
out of trouble during graduation night -- a night that has been historically 
high in teen drunk-driving-related deaths, said Susan Ahlswede, event 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's inaugural event drew 76% of the school's graduating class. This 
year, organizers hope to draw 90% of the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to keep them busy all night with live entertainment, a casino and 
various carnival booths. The main purpose of having Grad-Nite is to have a 
drug- and alcohol-free party. It keeps the kids in a sober atmosphere and out 
of the driving situation," Ahlswede said. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Cecilia Age voted against appropriating funds for the event, 
saying that while it was a worthwhile program, the council could not contribute 
to every community organization that asks for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I support the event and will be the first to but tickets for it. But where do 
you draw the line? Pretty soon you're spending funds on things that aren't city 
functions," Age said. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Gail Kerry voted to help fund the program and also praised its 
worthiness. But she added that the school's booster groups should be doing more 
to raise money. Kerry also suggested charging students a higher admission fee 
to help further defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Students will be charged $25 for admission to the event, which will be held on 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Ahlswede said last year's event cost $20,000, and estimated that this year's 
festivities will have a similar price tag. She said the money is raised through 
donations and ticket sales. GREG HERNANDEZ

EDUCATORS VOW TO RAISE CAP SCORES

<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers, administrators and school board members say they have recommitted 
themselves to helping students raise their California Assessment Program test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
District students placed near the bottom of the list on recent CAP tests when 
compared to other Orange County districts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should ever be below the 50th percentile," said school board 
president Nancy Zinberg. "We should have a stated goal of the 75th percentile, 
or better." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,300 La Habra students in grades three, six, and eight were tested in 
the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science and history/social science. 
</P>
<P>
While scores achieved by third graders were in the top 25% of statewide 
rankings, scores for older students were lower. Eighth-graders fared worse in 
1989 than in the previous year in three of four categories. 
</P>
<P>
A series of strategy meetings is being conducted to intensify efforts to 
prepare students for the tests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the board expressed disappointment with low scores on tests taken 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the special efforts of teachers and administrative staff towards 
each student doing well on the CAP tests, these results were completely 
surprising and unexpected," Supt. Richard Hermann said. 
</P>
<P>
"The specifics do not include a major curriculum overhaul, rather a re-focusing 
and realignment of CAP skills with the academic outcomes and expectations of 
each major subject," Hermann explained. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we are working on is development of test-taking skills," 
said Rosemary Herendeen, director of staff development and curriculum. "We need 
to put more emphasis on accuracy rather than speed." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hermann pointed to apparent inconsistencies between the low CAP scores 
and what he described as better than average scores on other tests, such as the 
Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, he emphasized: "We will not make excuses. 
Rather, we will re-focus our efforts and look to this year's tests as an 
opportunity to show major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Mantey, principal at Washington Middle School, "We're asking 
our teachers to work smarter, not harder." DAVID BURKE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;

<P>
CONSULTANT HIRED TO FIND A CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has hired a Sacramento consulting firm to conduct a national search 
for a new city manager, despite a last-minute attempt by Mayor Fred Hunter to 
keep the current city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter asked for a public hearing on whether Robert Simpson should be retained 
to follow through on the arena and other projects underway. That proposal was 
defeated 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, formerly Anaheim's fire chief, became city manager in 1987 after the 
City Council fired William O. Talley. Council members Tom Daly, Miriam Kaywood 
and Irv Pickler voted against. The campaign to keep Simpson was supported by 
the Muncipal Employees Union, which has distributed about 900 buttons bearing 
Simpson's picture around city hall. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson announced Oct. 3 that he will retire in May. The new city manager will 
supervise a budget of $568 million and a staff of 4,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Andersen &amp; Associates will be paid $14,500 to find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new city manager will be announced in late March or early 
April, said Dave Morgan, Anaheim's human resources director. The job will pay 
from $108,000 to $149,000 a year, depending on the experience of the 
administrator, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to running Anaheim, which has 234,000 residents, the city manager 
also oversees the operation of the Anaheim Convention Center, Anaheim Stadium 
and the city's power and water utilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of a plan to develop the rural landscape of Talega Valley into the 
area's next planned community are requesting that city and county officials be 
given a minority voice in a committee that would oversee a proposed 1,175-acre 
nature preserve in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The request by Santa Margarita Co. officials to change the wording of the 
conservancy management plan will be considered at 7 tonight by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Because 1,000 acres of the conservancy lie in county territory on Rancho 
Mission Viejo and 175 acres are in city territory, the landowners have said 
they oppose each entity having a one-third representation on the management 
board, according to a report from city planner James R. Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita Co. officials have said they would like to retain a majority 
voice on the conservancy management board for 1,000 acres in county territory 
and dedicate to the city its 175-acre portion of the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Planned are 5,000 homes as well as commercial centers, hotels and two 18-hole 
golf courses. It is located off the east end of Avenida Pico. WENDY PAULSON

A Tustin couple who managed a Pomona apartment complex have won $609,000 from 
the building's owner for failing to pay them their agreed-upon wages for more 
than two years, the couple's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court here awarded $200,000 in punitive 
damages and about $409,000 in compensatory damages to Roy and Cornelia 
Lululescu, who used to be live-in managers of the 64-unit Tahiti Village 
apartments in Pomona, attorney Maurice Mandel said. 
</P>
<P>
The award, rendered last week after a three-week trial, was assessed against 
Nick Mallas, a San Juan Capistrano man who owns commercial and residential 
rental properties, Mandel said. Mallas and his attorneys could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Lululescus, who now live in Tustin, contended that Mallas breached their 
salary contract by failing to pay them $10 an hour for managing the Tahiti 
Village complex and several other properties between September, 1983, and 
January, 1986. Mandel said much of the couple's work consisted of complying 
with city orders to repair substandard septic tanks and eradicate roaches and 
vermin on the property.

YOUTH SUES POLICE OVER ANONYMITY IN DRUG INVESTIGATION

<P>
An Irvine High School student, beaten last January by two youths who suspected 
him of being a drug informant, sued the Irvine Police Department on Tuesday, 
claiming it should have protected his anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The student, now 16, suffered a broken leg when two older teen-agers approached 
him Jan. 18 near the bicycle rack on school grounds and began punching and 
kicking him. 
</P>
<P>
School officials, who first suspended the attackers and then transferred them 
to another school, had made public statements that the younger boy was not a 
drug informant. The two had attacked the wrong boy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
While the student does not say in his lawsuit that he was a police informant, 
he does state that he talked with officers from the Irvine Police Department 
about drugs at the school. But the student said he had been promised by the 
police and school administrators that "none of the information they requested 
from him would ever be disclosed, and further assured (him) that his identity 
would remain confidential." 
</P>
<P>
The student said he had been interviewed by authorities in relation to an 
ongoing investigation into drug use at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests made later at the school followed statements by police to some students 
that led them to believe that the 16-year-old was the informant, the suit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The student also filed suit against the Irvine Unified School District and the 
parents of the two youths accused of assaulting him. The youth filing the 
lawsuit has also been transferred to another school.

INSANITY REJECTED AS HIGH SCHOOL SIEGE DEFENSE;

COURTS: YOUTH, 15, IS ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON 
AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT.

The attorney for a teen-age student accused of shooting a boy in the face and 
holding a drama class hostage at an Anaheim high school said Tuesday that he 
will not use insanity as a defense, raising the possibility that the youth will 
plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell L. (Cory) Robb, 15, reportedly beset with family problems, is accused 
of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of false 
imprisonment and bringing a firearm onto school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could be imprisoned in the California Youth Authority until he 
turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Proctor, Cordell's court-appointed attorney, said before the youth's 
pretrial hearing in Juvenile Court here: "There's no defense. . . . It's not a 
matter of what he did; it's a matter of what we can do to help him." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, the ninth-grader armed himself with a handgun and shotgun, walked 
into a drama class at Loara High School in Anaheim and shot Anthony Lopez, also 
15, in the left side of his face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez had reportedly told Cordell that he did not think the gun was real. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell held students at gunpoint for about half an hour while talking with 
police on a classroom telephone. Then he surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, at Proctor's request, Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson 
appointed Dr. Ernest Klatte, a psychiatrist, to assess Cordell's mental 
stability and determine whether the youth is fit to cooperate with his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor said after the hearing the evaluation was needed to determine "why he 
acted the way he did and what we can do and try and help him." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the evaluation, Proctor said, he will not pursue a defense of insanity 
or diminished capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"He was neither," he said about Cordell before the hearing, adding that his 
client is competent to stand trial and fit to cooperate in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday hearing, Jameson ordered that a probation officer prepare a 
report on what types of rehabilitation would be available for Cordell and where 
he might be housed. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell was present at the hearing, his hands cuffed behind his back. Another 
hearing was scheduled for Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jameson ruled that Cordell represented a threat to himself and 
others and must be detained indefinitely. He will be held in Juvenile Hall 
during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor did not oppose the ruling. He said his client had been placed on a 
"suicide watch" for a short time after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell took the class hostage in a bid to get his stepfather's attention so 
they could discuss their problems, Proctor said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the family is moving to Northern California and that the youth no 
longer wants to live with his stepfather.

DOWNEY JR. DRAWS 150 IN AUDIENCE, 15 PROTESTERS 
</P>

While 15 picketing students denounced him as racist, Morton Downey Jr., the 
deposed king of schlock and shock television, lit a cigarette and fulminated 
inside Cal State Fullerton's Titan Hall on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"You ready for some (profanity) tonight?" Downey said, and Titan Hall erupted 
in hoots, grunts, whistles and catcalls from more than 150 students. 
</P>
<P>
For the next hour, and with all the basic profanity he could muster, Downey 
launched into a controlled tirade against lawyers, doctors, gays, the 
government, television advertisers and his planned subject for the night: 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there censorship on American TV today?" Downey asked his audience. 
"Forty-three percent of ad money comes from foreign companies. When they don't 
want something on TV, they can withdraw their ad money and they can do a hit 
list if they don't like you." 
</P>
<P>
The appearance by the acerbic Downey was sponsored by the Associated Students 
and paid for by $5,000 in student funds, which are collected through a 
mandatory student fee. Downey, whose raucous TV talk show was canceled last 
July because of declining ratings, has been on the lecture circuit since then. 
</P>
<P>
Before the event began, about 15 students from the Multi-Cultural Council, 
representing 28 campus groups, picketed outside the University Center. A few 
carried signs saying "Down With Downey." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Multi-Cultural Council passed a resolution condemning Downey as 
a racist and called for a boycott of his appearance. As Downey took the podium, 
a council representative handed him a note signed by the group's chairwoman, 
Judy Perry-Lichtenstein. Downey read it aloud. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect you to use judicious and non-profane language," it read. 
</P>
<P>
Downey wadded up the note and denied he was a racist, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one . . . race. That's the human race. Black, brown, white, 
yellow, it's all one race." 
</P>
<P>
Perry-Lichtenstein, a graduate student in public administration, said that in 
past public appearances Downey has used racial epithets in reference to blacks 
and has denigrated other cultural and minority groups, including Arabs and 
Iranians, gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting what we consider the socially irresponsible use of $5,000 in 
student money to bring a known racist to campus," she said. "We believe 
institutional sponsorship of a racist form of entertainment can only raise the 
tolerance level for racism." 
</P>
<P>
To persuade students not to attend the event, the Multi-Cultural Council posted 
flyers around campus that contained a ghost image of a skull and crossbones and 
accused Downey of being a racist. 
</P>
<P>
The flyers brought a swift rebuke from Associated Students President Jim Simon, 
who demanded that the council stop distributing the handbills because it might 
incite violence at the event. Simon said the Associated Students supported the 
council's right to call for a boycott but did not like the way it was being 
publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put a skull and crossbones on an article, it's more than just a 
protest. It suggests a threat," Simon said. "It's our feeling and after talking 
with a lawyer that this could entice violence at the protest. At the same time, 
we feel we have a right to bring Morton Downey Jr. here." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest bunch of malarkey I have heard of," Perry-Lichtenstein 
retorted. "They sponsor this as a free-speech event, and then they deny us our 
free speech." 
</P>
<P>
Associated Student Productions, which sponsored Downey's appearance, denied it 
was insensitive to racial concerns and decided to proceed with the event, it 
said, to protect the right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey brouhaha comes on the heels of other racial controversies, including 
a recent fraternity "slave auction" and Aunt Jemima lip-sync. Aunt Jemima, a 
black maid, is the trademark of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a protest erupted when it was discovered that Thomas L. Metzger, a 
former California Ku Klux Klan leader, was using a public-access television 
studio to tape his nationally distributed cable-TV series, "Race and Reason."

PLAYOFF OFFENSIVE GAME PLAN: LITIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Students at Huntington Beach High School should have been in class Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Savanna High School should not have been in tears Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Fountain Valley High School should not have been given false hope, 
booster clubs should not be holding car washes for legal fees, and 
quarterbacks, not judges, should be deciding who wins Southern Section football 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The day the Southern Section office always feared finally happened Tuesday, the 
day the adults went wild and turned a game for 17-year-olds into a legislative 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Because an ineligible player was found on the football rosters of Huntington 
Beach, Savanna and La Puente high schools this week, three teams were forced 
out of the playoffs -- promptly, sending two of them into the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard, so far: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach: 1-0. Tuesday, the Oilers received a temporary restraining 
order against the Southern Section, preventing their disqualification from the 
Division I tournament and reinstating them as a playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente: On deck. Encouraged by the Huntington Beach ruling, La Puente is 
planning to enter the same legal arena. "This gives us a lot of hope," football 
Coach Rick Kunishimi said. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna: Idle. But probably taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout has been widespread. When 8-2 Huntington Beach was barred from the 
playoffs, 5-5 Fountain Valley replaced the Oilers and was matched against the 
division's top-seeded team, 10-0 Fontana. Now, Huntington Beach is back in, 
Fountain Valley is out and Fontana is none too pleased about the upgraded 
quality of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Next, maybe Fontana and Fountain Valley can pursue restraining orders to 
restrain the Huntington Beach restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a joke going around the office," says Dean Crowley, the Southern 
Section's beleaguered associate commissioner. "Next year, we'll have a 15-week 
season. Ten weeks for the regular season, a week off for litigation and then 
four weeks of playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but nobody's really laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has spun ludicrously out of control -- What's your record? 
Six-and-two and two games pending -- but the blame belongs with neither the 
high schools nor the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the high schools are distraught. Huntington Beach is making only its 
third playoff appearance in 23 years. Savanna had just won its first league 
title since the school opened in 1961. La Puente hadn't qualified for the 
playoffs in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Take those accomplishments away and a fight, rightly, should be expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section, meanwhile, is only upholding the constitution that was 
approved by its administrative council, which is composed of high school 
principals. "It's our job to enforce the rules," Crowley said. "If they want to 
change the rule, a vote of our administrative council could change it." 
</P>
<P>
So change it. 
</P>
<P>
There's something wrong with a rule that wipes out the efforts of an entire 
team because of clerical sloppiness, because all the facts weren't sufficiently 
checked. Right now, the punishment does not fit the crime, as Huntington Beach 
students sought to underscore by their three-hour boycott of classes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Even my wife was mad about it," said Crowley. "We were watching (the report on 
the boycott) on the news and she got irate. She turned to me and said, 'You 
shouldn't be penalizing the kids. Fifty-five kids go out for football and you 
punish all of them because of one?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Linda, I agree with you. We have compassion, too." 
</P>
<P>
Compassion, yes. 
</P>
<P>
The right constitution, no. 
</P>
<P>
According to Crowley, the Washington and Nevada high school athletic 
federations levy fines against schools found with ineligible players. No games, 
championships or playoff berths are forfeited. Just money. 
</P>
<P>
And that means no pre-playoff litigation. 
</P>
<P>
It seems an equitable, workable system. Since high school principals are 
responsible for fielding teams of eligible athletes -- that's also in the 
Southern Section Blue Book, Rule 302 -- make the principals pay and let the 
players play. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section officials say they like the fine system, with one reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with one parent who thought a fine was a good idea until he 
started thinking," Crowley said. "He told me, 'Well, suppose you get the 
booster club to pay the fine. Then you have a situation where schools are going 
out and getting ineligible players and just paying the fine at the end of the 
season.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a better world, high school athletic programs would be above such chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
But in this one, it's best to have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
So along with the fine, you: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Declare the guilty player ineligible for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strip his team of the home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Force the school to forfeit all gate receipts from playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put the school on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of probation, the guilty school cannot commit a similar infraction 
during the next five years. Since such a violation would indicate a blatant 
disregard for the rules, the principal (and/or coach) would be censured by the 
Southern Section -- in essence, the section would recommend that he be removed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the amount of the initial fine would be doubled and the team, for 
that season, would be declared an "independent" -- able to qualify for the 
playoffs only as a wild-card entrant, regardless of its won-lost record. And 
the Southern Section designates all wild-card entrants. 
</P>
<P>
In any scenario, the players would still have the opportunity to play. 
</P>
<P>
And before we got buried by the petitions and the legal briefs, that was the 
bottom line, wasn't it?

MORNING BRIEFING: URINATION 'SPELL' CONJURES UP LIFE BANS FOR 4 SOCCER PLAYERS

Soccer officials in Zimbabwe banned four members of the army's first division 
Tongogara side for life after they urinated in front of several thousand 
spectators at a stadium in eastern Zimbabwe Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Chirwa of the Zimbabwe Football Assn. said the players were practicing 
tribal witchcraft in an attempt to change their side's fortunes. It was losing, 
1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to advise all football teams that next time they should go to a 
better witch doctor," Chirwa said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tongogara players probably agree. Their spell failed, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What jockey won the first three runnings of the Hollywood Gold 
Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Marching on their stomachs: San Francisco running back Roger Craig was on the 
bench in the fourth quarter of the 49ers' 45-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons 
after having rushed for nearly 100 yards. The 49er offensive linemen asked 
Coach George Seifert to put Craig back in the game; Craig has a deal with his 
linemen that if he gains more than 100 yards, he will buy them dinner. Craig 
finished with 109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: George Woolf, aboard Seabiscuit in 1938, Kayak II in 1939 and 
Challedon in 1940. 
</P>

Rematch is off: Steve McCarthy has withdrawn from his rematch with Steve Wilson 
scheduled for tonight in Reading, England. McCarthy, who has the flu, was to 
have fought Tony Wilson in a rematch of their light-heavyweight fight in 
September that was halted when Wilson's mother, Minna, climbed into the ring 
and hit McCarthy with a high-heeled shoe.

DIVISION I; 
</P>
<P>
FONTANA MUST BUCK NO. 1 JINX

<P>
Fontana High School is hands-down, head-and-shoulders above the rest of the 
Division I playoff field this season, so does this mean the Steelers will win 
the championship? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
The history of this division -- originally called the Big Five when created in 
1977 -- is that No. 1-seeded teams fare about as well as Alka-Seltzer in water. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat had the misfortune of being seeded the No. 1 team several times 
this decade and each year couldn't make it out of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Loyola, a team with a great defense and a run-oriented, ball-control 
offense, was seeded No. 1 in the division and No. 1 in the nation -- as ranked 
by USA Today -- and the Cubs never made it past the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
And this year there is Fontana (10-0), a team with a great defense and a 
run-oriented, ball-control offense that enters the playoffs as the division's 
only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers may catch a break this year because hard times have hit this 
division, by reputation the toughest every year. But this season, seven of the 
16 playoff teams have four losses or more. The usually tough Angelus, Moore and 
Sunset leagues, which have produced nine division champions in 12 years, have 
been less than intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers have been nothing short of awesome, averaging 30 points a game and 
giving up just five. 
</P>
<P>
Running out of a variation of the Delaware Wing-T, Fontana running backs make 
their way through holes created by a massive offensive line that averages 250 
pounds a player. The Steelers pass only about five times a game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical Citrus Belt smash-mouth football," Fountain Valley Coach Mike 
Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
But will it work? It did in 1987, when Fontana won it all. But standing in the 
way this year are the likes of perennial powers Long Beach Poly, Loyola and 
Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (8-1) may be the most talented team in the division, with 6-foot-5 tight 
end Willie McGinest and safety Jason Jones, who many say is better than Mark 
Carrier, who has gone on to be an All-American at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat (7-3) made it to the finals last season, losing to Fountain Valley. 
The Lancers have a great offense, averaging nearly 25 points a game, headed by 
a great athlete in Jeremy Smith, who is used at wide receiver and running back. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (8-1) doesn't have the pressure hanging over it of being No. 1 in the 
nation, and it has a more diversified offense than last year's one-dimensional 
running attack. Quarterback Brian Dennis has thrown for 930 yards this season, 
more than twice what Loyola threw for last year. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's defense is still good, allowing other teams an average of just 60 
yards rushing a game. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams in this division could very well be wiped out in the first 
round, or make some noise of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Edison is one of the hottest teams in the playoffs, having won five of its last 
six games. The Chargers' offense is led by Donnie Smith, a solid quarterback 
who completed 65% of his passes (126 of 193) for 1,547 yards, and running back 
Shane Sherman, who rushed for 1,465 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Edison defense has given up only 18 points in its last three games, 
something Coach Dave White attributes to switching backup tailback Chip 
Anderson and safety James Eidam to defensive ends to give his team more 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last three weeks, we've seen a significant drop in opposing passing and 
rushing statistics," White said. "The passing yardage has dropped 25% per game 
and we're getting more than three sacks per game. 
</P>
<P>
"We start seven juniors, and I think we're peaking at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
It was just two seasons ago that another Sunset League team, Fountain Valley, 
lost its first four games and then got hot, won its last six regular-season 
games and made it all the way to the Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to be said about getting hot at the right time," Milner said. "I 
think Edison has a great chance. Sherman is tough and Smith is having a great 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei gave Loyola a good game in the quarterfinals last season, losing 
30-17, and returns the heart of the team in quarterback Danny O'Neil (1,929 
yards passing and 18 touchdowns), running back Kealii Clifford (795 yards 
rushing) and outstanding defensive lineman Ryan Motherway. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs have also added an outstanding receiver in Tino Chavez, who has 
caught 41 passes for 774 yards. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION I IN A BOXDefending Champion: Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
Top Teams: Fontana (10-0) and Long Beach Poly (8-1) 
</P>
<P>
Dark Horses: Edison (8-2) and San Gorgonio (7-3) 
</P>
<P>
Worst Draw: Mater Dei (6-4). The Monarchs must play Redlands (8-2), the No. 2 
team out of the division's best league (Citrus Belt), on the road. If they win, 
the Monarchs will probably play third-seeded Loyola (8-1), which beat them in 
the second round of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: Running backs Samita Vaoifi (Fontana), Jeremy Smith (Bishop Amat) 
and Shane Sherman (Edison); quarterback Danny O'Neil (Mater Dei); tight end 
Willie McGinest (Long Beach Poly). 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy: This may be the weakest this division -- originally called the Big 
Five -- has been since it was created in 1977. Seven of the 16 playoff teams 
have records of 6-4 or worse.

DIVISION VI; 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS, ESTANCIA MAY EMERGE FROM PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a safe bet, a sure bet, that an Orange County team will win the Division 
VI championship. The only question is, which one? 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams from the Freeway, Garden Grove, Orange and Sea View leagues 
are all represented in the division playoffs, along with three teams from the 
traditionally weaker Suburban League. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for defending champion Corona del Mar (7-3) to repeat. The Sea Kings 
inched into the playoffs with an at-large berth, but their inexperience at 
quarterback and lack of upperclassmen have been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four top-seeded teams, Sunny Hills (No. 1), Estancia (2) and 
Pacifica (4) are from Orange County. John Glenn of the Suburban League is the 
third-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills, 10-0 and ranked third in the final Orange County Sportswriters' 
Assn. poll, is the legitimate favorite, but this could be Estancia's year. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills should breeze by first-round opponent Kennedy (5-5), the 
third-place team from a none-too-tough Garden Grove League. The Lancers would 
then face the winner of the Tustin (6-4)-Norwalk (8-2) contest, which probably 
will be won by a tough Tustin team. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia shouldn't have any trouble with first-round opponent La Mirada (7-3), 
the third-seeded team from the Suburban League. Then it's on to the winner of 
the Western (7-3)-Troy (7-3) game. Glenn, the other seeded team in Estancia's 
half of the bracket, probably will be lucky to meet, let alone defeat Estancia 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
If past Suburban League performances are any indication, the league's teams 
will serve as tune-ups for Orange County teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Suburban League teams were 0-6 in the division, being 
eliminated in the first round. The last time a Suburban League team won the 
division was in 1977, when it was called the Central Conference and Norwalk 
defeated Neff. 
</P>
<P>
"We played La Mirada two years ago in the first round and they came in as the 
strong second-place team and we won the ballgame, 28-0," Pacifica Coach Bill 
Craven said. "We had some people out at the La Mirada ballgame (this week) and 
they came back wishing that that would be our draw." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Coach Willie Norman says the Suburban League has improved this year, 
thanks to a drop in the coaching turnover rate. "People are not coming and 
going like they did before," he said. "The last couple of years, we had 
turnover at every school except for maybe one." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Glenn, the Suburban League's top representative, barely beat Buena Park 
(2-8). Glenn escaped with a 19-17 victory in the second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn meets Newport Harbor (8-2) in the first round. Glenn's top performer is 
Travis Carter, a wide receiver/running back who also plays safety. He has 13 
touchdowns, two on kickoff returns of 95 and 60 yards. He also has 36 
receptions for more than 600 yards and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first 10-0 team in Estancia's 25-year history and possibly the best 
team the school has ever fielded. Give the Eagles the edge over Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Senior-dominated Estancia has limited postseason experience; it advanced to the 
playoffs last season but lost in the first round to Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about our team," Estancia Coach John Liebengood said, "is they have 
been hungry all year because people have not given us any credit in the first 
part of the season because we had a really easy preseason (schedule)." 
</P>
<P>
But more important, Estancia has perhaps the division's best defense and enough 
versatility in its run-dominated offense to keep opponents honest. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle defense has shut out six teams and allowed only 32 points. Opponents 
have completed an average of 38% of their passes against an Estancia secondary 
that has 10 interceptions. Estancia's key player is running back Josh 
Wojtkiewicz, who has rushed 187 times for 1,007 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
Quarterback Dan Ucker has completed 60% of his passes for more than 1,100 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills has the division's top rusher in Brian Pizula, who has gained 1,226 
yards in 152 carries. Pizula, who has an 8.1 yard average, teams with two other 
backs who each have rushed for more than 500 yards -- Kenny Overby (6.4 yards 
per carry) and Mike Sullivan (8.5 yards per carry). Look for Estancia's 
offensive variety and strong defense to offset Sunny Hills' size advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, another strong defensive club, has been to the finals the past two 
seasons, winning the title in 1987. This year, Valencia is a young unseeded 
team that could sneak in the back door to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica has advanced to the semifinals the past two seasons only to lose to 
the eventual champions -- Valencia in 1988 and Corona del Mar in 1989. History 
could repeat a third time. Pacifica has key players in senior quarterback Bobby 
Anderson (1,415 yards) and running back Chris Shockley (191 carries for 1,154 
yards), but its defense has had trouble pressuring the quarterback and stopping 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is the dark horse, thanks to a good draw -- it plays Brea-Olinda in 
the first round, then the winner of the Pacifica -- Corona del Mar game -- a 
solid defense (69 points allowed) and a shotgun offense that showcases 
quarterback Rene Arias (1,536 yards). 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta is the sleeper. The Garden Grove League's second-place team has Trent 
Julian, a multipurpose player who has rushed for 508 yards and caught 24 passes 
for 424 yards. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION VI IN A BOXDefending Champion: Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
Top Teams: Sunny Hills (10-0) and Estancia (10-0) 
</P>
<P>
Dark Horse: Fullerton (7-3) 
</P>
<P>
Best Draw: Valencia (10-0). The Tigers take on La Quinta, a 6-4 team from a 
weaker league. If Valencia wins, it plays the winner of Newport Harbor 
(8-2)-Glenn (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
Worst Draw: Kennedy. A 5-5 team, the Fighting Irish face top-seeded and 
undefeated Sunny Hills on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: Fullback Brian Pizula (Sunny Hills), running back Chris Shockley 
(Pacifica), quarterback Bobby Anderson (Pacifica), quarterback Rene Arias 
(Fullerton), running back Josh Wojtkiewicz (Estancia), running back/receiver 
Trent Julian (La Quinta), receiver Steve Friedrich (Troy) and running back 
Travis Carter (Glenn). 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy: Orange County teams have won the division every year since 1978.

Laguna Beach High School swept to a surprisingly easy 15-4, 15-7, 15-9 victory 
over Capistrano Valley Tuesday night to advance to the semifinals of the 
Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists' (19-1) superior serving game and balanced attack was more than a 
match for the Cougars (17-4), who were coming off their first South Coast 
League championship. The victory sets up Thursday's semifinal match with Mira 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is the tournament's No. 1 seed and is rated the top high school 
girls' volleyball team in the nation by USA Today. The Artists are the 
tournament's No. 4 seed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the capability to win three straight," Artists Coach Lance 
Stewart said. "When we're on top of our game, we can do it, and this was our 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Kit Spath's ace serve gave the Artists a 10-3 advantage 
en route to their 15-4 first-set victory, and the Cougars could never recover 
after that. "The girls seemed to get frustrated," Cougar Coach John Gipe said. 
"We were our own worst enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitters Sara Nelson and Spath led the balanced Laguna scoring with nine 
kills apiece. Kealy Clark had eight. Setter Angie Rush contributed 12 assists. 
Becky Linhart (12 kills, five blocks, six assists) and Christina Grady (10 
kills) led Capistrano Valley's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 3, St. Joseph 0 -- Krista Hartling had 10 kills and seven digs 
and Lara Carlsen had 11 kills and eight blocks as the Sea Kings (23-1) advanced 
to the semifinals with a 15-10, 15-8, 15-13 victory at home. Setter Prentice 
Perkins had 27 assists for the Sea Kings, who will play Santa Barbara Thursday 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In 4-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 3, Edison 1 -- Sharman Grant had 18 kills and Jonnie Jung had 10 to 
lead the Aztecs (16-1), 15-12, 15-9, 12-15, 15-10, at Esperanza. Esperanza will 
play Arcadia in the semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1-A girls' volleyball quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 3, LA Baptist 2 -- Adine Powloski had 17 kills and Megan Morse 
had 12 kills and four blocks as Santa Margarita (19-2) won, 15-12, 13-15, 
15-12, 9-15, 15-9, at home. Santa Margarita will play St. Anthony in the 
semifinals Thursday. TOM BIRSCHBACH

RULE HELPS SUNNY HILLS EDGE SAILORS

<P>
Newport Harbor High School could only watch as the final seconds ran out 
Tuesday. Watch and ponder a multitude of wasted opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Sailors had their chances against Sunny Hills in the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A water polo playoffs. But with the aid 
of a new rule, the unseeded Lancers were able to hold on for a 7-6 victory at 
Independence Park in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
With 36 seconds left and Sunny Hills clinging to a one-goal lead, the Lancers 
went into a stall. They ran off the allotted 35 seconds on the shot clock and 
left the Sailors only one second to try to tie the match. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor didn't even get a shot off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we work on in practice and use in big games," Sunny Hills 
Coach Keith Nighswonger said. "You just have to hope nobody takes a shot no 
matter what. Even if the goal is empty." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, such a ploy would have been impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Under Southern Section rules, a team had to show progress in the pool and could 
not stall. But that rule was changed this season and the Lancers (19-9) used it 
to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills spread out the pool and played catch for the 35 seconds while the 
Sailors desperately tried to apply pressure and force a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been in favor of the rule change," said Newport Harbor Coach Bill 
Barnett, who also coaches the U.S. national team. "It teaches kids bad habits. 
Then we have to retrain them at the national level." 
</P>
<P>
But as excuses go, Newport Harbor didn't have a leg to tread water with. There 
were just too many wasted opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (18-10) capitalized on only one of five power plays. Twice they 
missed shots in close and two other times Sunny Hills goalie Andrew Tinseth 
made diving saves. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors also had three shots hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills had its own problems on offense, but did manage a 4-0 run in the 
second quarter to erase a 2-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Corrigan, who missed part of the season with a broken collarbone, 
scored two of the goals in the second quarter, including a backhand shot with 
15 seconds left to give the Lancers a 5-2 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor shut out the Lancers in the third quarter and trailed only 6-4 
midway through the fourth. However, Michael Thompson scored off a rebound with 
2:43 left to give the Lancers a three-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills plays second-seeded Villa Park Thursday in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
In other 4-A quarterfinal matches: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 9, Millikan 6 -- Millikan led 4-2 late in the second quarter but 
didn't score again until the fourth, and Villa Park scored six consecutive 
goals to take an 8-4 lead at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Gavin Arroyo 
scored three goals and Gary Larson and Neal Blockmeier had two eachfor the 
Spartans (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 14, University 10 -- The Hawks, seeded No. 1, survived a scare from 
the unseeded Trojans at Heritage Park in Irvine. El Dorado (25-3) trailed 10-8 
with two minutes remaining in the third quarter but scored twice to tie the 
match, 10-10, and shut University out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Maclear and Kyle Utsumi led the Hawks with four goals each. El Dorado 
plays unseeded Corona del Mar Thursday in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 10, Long Beach Wilson 4 -- Ryan Weir had three goals to lead 
Corona del Mar (26-3) past the fourth-seeded team at Belmont Plaza. Brandon 
Howald, Gunnar Gustafson and Scott Tucker had two goals each for Corona del 
Mar.

'GRAND RE-OPENING' BEGINS FRIDAY AT WESTMINSTER MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by Mary Ann Galante, Times staff writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fierce battle for shoppers' dollars continues this week with the "grand 
re-opening" of Westminster Mall, which has just about finished a more than 
$10-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year face lift, Orange County's third-highest-grossing mall is 
planning three days of promotional shows and displays to show off its new look 
beginning Friday evening. "The center is 15 years old, so it definitely needed 
an upgrade," mall spokeswoman Jane Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic difference is in the mall's new glass, free-standing Jewel 
Court area, located in the center of the mall where the food area used to be. 
The remodeled 25,000-square-foot area now features a glass-enclosed elevator 
highlighted by a neon lighting system and surrounded by a new fountain and 
splash pool. Eleven shops are also opening in the Jewel Court area, including 
Charlotte Russe, the Bombay Co., Hudson Goodman Jewelers, Imaginarium, Sunshade 
Optique and Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean. 
</P>
<P>
New retailers have been added throughout the mall as well. Newcomers on the 
lower level include Units, Socks du Jour, J. Burton Jewelers, Prints Plus, 
Cat's Meow and Hot Topic. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's owners, Corporate Property Investors, also have added an upscale 
food court -- called Cafe 405 -- which transformed a formerly vacant space into 
a 20,000-square-foot center serving sushi, barbecue snacks and assorted finger 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
In total, the renovation will add 25,000 square feet of gross leaseable area, 
giving Westminster Mall a total of 1,052,000 square feet.

<P>
The final phase of the remodeling, redoing entrances and the mall's sign, is 
scheduled for completion next spring. 
</P>
<P>
But mall officials are hoping the sprucing-up will begin to pay off before 
then. The mall is projecting sales per square foot of $235 by the end of 1989, 
compared with $202 per square foot last year, said Reid.

ANAHEIM FIRM EXPECTS MOUSE THAT ROARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CalComp Inc. Chairman William Conlin says his company has built a better 
mousetrap. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least a better mouse. 
</P>
<P>
CalComp of Anaheim jumped into the personal computer business Tuesday by 
introducing its first computer mouse, an increasingly popular type of device 
that can be pushed about on a desktop to move the cursor on a computer screen 
and give commands. 
</P>
<P>
With the new product -- unveiled at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas 
-- the computer-graphics company is stepping into a faster-growing part of the 
computer business in hope of boosting sluggish sales. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in the early 1960s, CalComp has specialized in a small 
segment of the computer market by supplying costly digitizers, plotters and 
other graphics equipment for use by engineers, industrial designers and the 
like. Its products are used to draw such complex pictures as topographical maps 
or mechanical drawings. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason for the move into the PC field is that sales in the once-booming 
market for computer-aided design equipment have tailed off in 1989, Conlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
CAD sales will grow just 5% to 10% this year, less than half the rate of a few 
years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The CAD market has been very good to us . . . but it only represents about 2% 
or 3% of the total computer marketplace," he said. "In the general PC market, 
we're talking about millions of potential customers." 
</P>
<P>
Conlin recently said CalComp's 1989 earnings will be down on sales of $450 
million to $475 million. He cited sluggish growth in the CAD market as one 
reason for the lower earnings. CalComp is a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp., which 
does not disclose profit figures for its units. 
</P>
<P>
Conlin hopes that its newfangled mouse -- nicknamed the WIZ -- will work some 
magic on CalComp's sales. The company will spend $5 million to promote the WIZ 
and has signed up Ingram Micro D of Santa Ana, the nation's largest wholesaler 
of microcomputer products, to get the WIZ into the nation's computer stores. 
</P>
<P>
The mouse gained popularity with the introduction of Apple Computer's Macintosh 
five years ago. The Macintosh uses a mouse to move the cursor to a specific 
place on the screen and issue commands to the computer by pointing and clicking 
the device. A mouse eliminates the need to type in numerical or alphabetical 
commands to the computer, as must be done with traditional PC software 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh mice have proven so popular that International Business Machines 
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have brought the concept to basic operating system 
software, called OS/2, used inside IBM's most powerful personal models and 
compatible machines. 
</P>
<P>
"When OS/2 comes out, it will function a lot like the Macintosh," Conlin said. 
"That will increase the demand for mouse products." 
</P>
<P>
CalComp's $200 mouse, which will work with both IBM compatibles and the 
Macintosh, functions differently from other devices on the market. 
</P>
<P>
It combines a mouse with a plastic card called a template. The template allows 
the user to position the mouse above a certain spot on the card, click a button 
and send a command to the computer. It reduces the need to display menus or a 
list of choices on the screen before executing a command. 
</P>
<P>
"The slowest part of using a computer is the user himself," Conlin said, but 
the CalComp mouse will help "cut through the mess of pulling down menus and 
wondering which one contains what function." 
</P>
<P>
Industry forecasts indicate that 5 million mice will be sold in 1990, up from 
an expected 4 million this year, Conlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to sell hundreds of thousands" of mice, Conlin said.

SHAREHOLDERS REVOLT AGAINST COMP CARE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTORS: A GROUP IS DEMANDING A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE FALTERING 
HEALTH CARE COMPANY.

<P>
Several shareholders of Comprehensive Care announced Tuesday they are banding 
together to elect a new board of directors willing to consider a variety of 
options to solve the company's financial woes, including a sizable sale of 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, is the latest piece of bad news to hit the nation's largest alcohol 
and drug treatment company, which is moving its headquarters from Irvine to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Comp Care announced a $4.7-million third-quarter loss, sending 
its stock plunging in one day from $8.375 to $3.625. Two days later on Oct. 27, 
First Hospital Corp. backed out of a critical merger with Comp Care after one 
of the financiers refused to consent to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care is now in the process of trying to sell all of its California assets 
to stave off creditors demanding the payment of $25 million in loans that were 
due Oct. 18. The company has not announced plans to sell any other assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we believe the company is worth more in parts," said Les 
Livingston, spokesman for the group. "This company has basically been going 
nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
The investor group -- which includes executives of an insurance company and a 
construction firm -- said Tuesday's SEC filing is the first sign of a 
shareholder revolt against Comp Care management. The filing also said the group 
would consider a merger or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Bastille Day," said Ken Guenther, one of the group's members. "It's 
time for stockholders to take control and not sit back and accept whatever is 
done to them." 
</P>
<P>
Together, the investor group owns a 5.12% stake -- or 521,084 shares -- in Comp 
Care. They have lost millions in just the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The group's members include George B. Newman, president of a Portland insurance 
company; Charles Moore, president of a Kent, Wash., construction firm; Robert 
I. Miller, president of a Seattle engine company; Randy Wright, president of a 
Portland food brokerage and Guenther, marketing official with a Portland 
venture capital firm. 
</P>
<P>
Guenther said current management, including president and chief executive W. 
James Nicol, is "not up to the task" of turning around Comp Care. 
</P>
<P>
Nicol was appointed to those positions earlier this month, replacing longtime 
executive B. Lee Karns. Neither was available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care has not yet announced the date of its annual shareholders meeting, 
which was held last year on Oct. 6. Guenther said the investor group may not 
wait for that meeting before trying to install its own nominees for the board. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care has suffered huge losses and declining revenue in recent months 
because of increased competition, stricter insurance requirements and bad 
management, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Comp Care's stock closed up .375 to close at $3.625.

ABC won the battle of big TV movies Sunday night, but didn't come close to 
unseating NBC as the prime-time ratings champ last week, the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
reported Tuesday. The peacock network had eight series among the week's 10 
most-watched programs, including its entire Thursday night lineup. CBS ran 
third for the week, as it has been doing for the season, placing only three 
series, "60 Minutes" (No. 9), "Murder, She Wrote" (No. 15) and "Jake and the 
Fatman" (No. 30), among the Top 30. The full list of ratings is on F9. 
</P>
<P>
*The first installment of ABC's two-part "Small Sacrifices" was the favorite 
choice among viewers from 9 to 11 p.m. Sunday. The movie, with Farrah Fawcett 
playing a woman who shot her children, attracted viewers in about 16.7 million 
homes. NBC's "Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker" was seen in about 14.2 
million homes, and CBS' "The Return of Sam McCloud" drew an audience in about 
11.9 million homes.

The work Andy Warhol did before he became the Andy Warhol in the early 1960s is 
the subject of an exhibit, " 'Success is a Job in New York . . . ': The Early 
Art and Business of Andy Warhol," at Newport Harbor Art Museum Jan. 21 through 
Mar. 18. The 194 works include self-portraits, magazine and book illustrations, 
promotional materials for industry and photographs of window installations 
Warhol in New York in the '50s. The exhibit -- named for an article Warhol 
illustrated in his salad days -- was organized by Grey Art Gallery at New York 
University and will be sponsored locally by South Coast Plaza.

Conductor Newton Wayland will replace singer Maureen McGovern in the Pacific 
Symphony's pops programs on Dec. 23 and 24 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. McGovern cancelled the local dates to appear in a New

THE YELLOWJACKETS BUZZ FROM ONE STYLE TO ANOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: POPULAR BAND, APPEARING THURSDAY AT THE COACH HOUSE, CREDITS CHANGES TO 
GROWTH, NOT AN IDENTITY CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Yellowjackets have an identity crisis. Well . . . not exactly a crisis -- 
more like a minor confusion. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the popular four-piece band -- which appears at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Thursday -- has won Grammy awards in the 
rhythm-and-blues as well as the jazz fusion categories. Their current album, 
"The Spin," is filled with straight-ahead jazz blowing, a marked contrast from 
the music on "Shades" -- music which, despite its Grammy award, was described 
by bassist Jimmy Haslip as "fusion disco." 
</P>
<P>
In their earliest years, when the band came into existence as a backup unit for 
Robben Ford, the sound was guitar- and blues-centered. When Ford left for a 
solo career after the first two albums, the Yellowjackets' identity drifted in 
and out of focus until the addition of saxophonist Marc Russo brought a frothy, 
pop-jazz feeling to the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
But the 'Jackets' current well-integrated, strongly improvisation-oriented 
sound didn't really emerge until drummer William Kennedy replaced Ricky Lawson 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps understandably, the players do not exactly revel in retracing the 
styles that have coursed through the band's 10-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could forget about all the changing personnel and the different 
labels," said pianist Russell Ferrante in a conversation last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get back to the simple question, 'Does the music speak to you, 
does it inspire you, does it do something to you that makes you think about the 
world or yourself?' Because when I'm composing, I'm not thinking about 
categories, or this or that. I'm just concentrating on finding out about what I 
have inside myself that I really want to express." 
</P>
<P>
Haslip, however, pointed out that pure self-expression is not always as easy as 
it seems. "To be perfectly honest about it," he explained, "being placed in 
different categories has been useful to us. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz is not really a popular idiom around the world. People don't seem to be 
willing to sit down and listen to it. They think it's some kind of wild Cecil 
Taylor record or something. So, in that respect, being known only by that label 
can be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we really do believe in jazz, so it's a kind of a 
double-edged sword. You want to be true to the art, you want to come up with 
something adventurous, but if no one's going to listen to it, well, then what? 
Do you continue to pursue some form of music that no one's interested in, or do 
you try to perform for the masses? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough question, and it's one that we deal with every time we go into 
the studio. Usually what wins out is that we're true to the art. We just play 
what we're honestly feeling and hope that it'll connect with a large audience. 
So far, at least, we've been pretty lucky at doing just that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his distaste for categories, Ferrante acknowledged that the group has 
made a strong evolutionary change in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that the music has gotten more improvisationally focused and 
more rhythmically elastic, especially since since William Kennedy joined the 
band on drums -- and that's for the last three albums. And a good part of that 
has been the move toward a more acoustic sound on the current album." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the music on "The Spin" was initially conceived with the thought 
of having the Yellowjackets record with producer-arranger Claus Ogermann. "We 
were really thinking of placing the band in an orchestral setting," Ferrante 
said, "but Ogermann's schedule was too busy and things didn't work out, at 
least not this time. But I think the acoustic sound of the album really was 
influenced by the thought of working with a large orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
As the Yellowjackets approach the end of their current tour, the prospect of 
making a new recording looms on the horizon. And with it, once again, the old, 
nagging question of musical identity. 
</P>
<P>
Haslip viewed the problem with characteristic directness: "Hey, we'll write the 
music, perform it to our best ability, play it from the heart as honestly as we 
can, and that's about all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante, the Yellowjackets' primary composer, took a somewhat more pensive 
pint of view. "Well, at the end of the tour," he said, "I guess we'll all just 
collapse for a while, and then start writing again. Every time we've done that, 
I've been amazed at how new things start bubbling up, and how there's just no 
telling what will come up next. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's what feels right to me, and maybe that's why there've been so many 
changes and so many categories. Maybe the real identity of the Yellowjackets 
simply comes from our desire to see where the music will take us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellowjackets will play Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE CLEANUP AT CANYON COUNTRY SITE SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California health authorities announced today that they will begin a cleanup of 
hazardous substances at a bankrupt oil refinery in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services has initially earmarked up to $1 
million on the cleanup of the five-acre Lubrication Co. of America site on Lang 
Station Road east of the Antelope Valley Freeway, said Richard Varenchik, a 
spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's toxic substances control program will also pay for a series of 
soil studies to determine if any ground contamination occurred from spillage of 
oils and fuels that were refined at the plant between 1960 and 1987, Varenchik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A report from the state agency concludes that surface runoff of spills from the 
plant was carried in a drainage ditch to the bed of the nearby Santa Clarita 
River. Preliminary tests of water from two wells in the area were inconclusive 
as to whether there was contamination from LCA, Varenchik said. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the cleanup came from a 1984 bond that raised funds for a statewide 
cleanup of hazardous substances. Under an agreement with Grant Ivey, the owner 
of LCA, the property will sold and the state will be reimbursed cleanup costs 
of up to $1.4 million, Varenchik said.

BUSH ENDORSES HOUSE PLAN TO BOOST SALARIES, TIGHTEN ETHICS, FOLEY SAYS

<P>
President Bush will back a plan to raise salaries for members of Congress and 
other top government officials by more than a third while tightening up ethics 
rules, the Speaker of the House said today. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that agreement with the 
Administration had been reached and that a statement from the President would 
be released. White House officials confirmed that privately in advance of the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
With the President's endorsement, House leaders formally unveiled their plan 
and scheduled a vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The package would raise salaries from $89,500 to almost $125,000 in just over 
13 months and impose new ethics rules on the amount and type of members' 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would apply to top officials governmentwide, except for the Senate, 
which was considering a separate ethics and pay package for itself. 
</P>
<P>
The House package implements the pay raise in two stages. On Jan. 1, members 
would get a 7.9% increase as a "cost-of-living" adjustment to make up for the 
two years in which members did not receive raises. 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a 25% raise would take effect and the teeth of the ethics package 
would kick in -- a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speech 
honorariums and stricter limits on other outside income. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, House members are allowed to keep honorariums up to 30% of their 
income, Senate members up to 40%. The new rules would ban accepting honorariums 
and limit other outside earned income to 15% of salary. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress later votes to kill the pay raise, the ethics changes on outside 
income would automatically be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Other ethics changes in the bill include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ending in 1993 the rule whereby House members elected before 1980 can 
pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire from Congress. Some members 
currently have more than $1 million stashed away. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increased detail of disclosure of personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the top category is "$250,000 and above." The new forms would have 
categories for "$250,000 to $500,000" and "greater than $1 million." Members 
who have blind trusts for their assets would have to report the size of the 
trust, in addition to the current requirement of reporting the income. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Revised procedures for the House Ethics Committee, including expanding the 
panel so that some members could investigate and others judge the results. 
Currently, the whole panel does both.

1,000 STUDENTS PROTEST BAN ON SAVANNA TEAM

<P>
About 1,000 students of Savanna High School walked out of classes for two hours 
this morning to protest a decision banning the football team from playoffs this 
weekend for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Students walked out of classes at 8 a.m. and rallied on the school's front 
lawn, waving banners and placards and chanting slogans in support of the 
Savanna Rebels, who forfeited a berth in the Southern Section Division VI 
playoffs, six victories and a tie for using a player who was in his fifth year 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels had secured their first championship of the Orange League in the 
school's nine-year history. That was also nullified by league principals who 
voted Tuesday on behalf of the California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Savanna High Football Boosters Club said today that they had 
retained a lawyer to try to overturn the principals' decision in court, just as 
the boosters club for Huntington Beach High School's Oilers successfully did 
Tuesday. Gloria George, a Savanna Boosters leader, said a suit was to be filed 
in Orange County Superior Court today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay here until we get it (the title) back," Denise Gaiye, a 
15-year-old sophomore wearing a Rebels jersey and a Rebels bandanna, said 
defiantly in a crowd of cheering students. "What we desire is what we're after. 
Because you know what, it was not Savanna's fault." 
</P>
<P>
A school administrator Tuesday acknowledged that he did not check closely 
enough on the transcript records of transfer student Ray Leuta, a reserve 
lineman who Savanna officials thought was playing in his fourth year. The 
school was notified by an administrator at one of Leuta's previous schools this 
week that the youth was actually in his fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna Principal William Wong said about three-quarters of the school's 1,460 
students participated in the walkout and rally.

FIVE-MIN. OVATION FOR WALESA;

CONGRESS HEARS PLEA FOR FUNDS

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, saluted on his historic visit to Congress with 
cheers, whistles and a five-minute standing ovation, told lawmakers today that 
U.S. aid to Poland "will not be wasted, and will never be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
He asked for more investment to help pull a bankrupt Polish economy from "the 
verge of utter catastrophe" and said such assistance in peacetime is "better 
than tanks, warships and warplanes." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech recounting the nine-year struggle of his union to form 
the first non-Communist government in the Soviet Bloc, Walesa gave thanks to 
Congress and the American people for years of support and words of admiration. 
</P>
<P>
"These are appreciated, but being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must 
tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the 
demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now," said the mustachioed 
46-year-old former shipyard electrician. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that assistance extended to democracy and freedom in Poland and all 
of Eastern Europe is the best investment in the future of peace, better than 
tanks, warships and warplanes, an investment leading to greater security," he 
said to resounding applause from a joint meeting of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa arrived in Washington on Monday for a four-day visit marked by numerous 
awards and a torrent of praise as Poland and other East European nations 
rapidly institute democratic and market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In more concrete action, the Senate voted Tuesday to authorize $657 million in 
economic aid to Poland over three years and $81 million for nearby Hungary, 
which also is dismantling its centrally controlled economy. 
</P>
<P>
The House went further, approving an initial one-year installment of $533 
million for the two Soviet Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
The steps to send economic aid to Poland have been accompanied by personal 
adulation for Walesa. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from 
President Bush on Monday, an AFL-CIO human rights award on Tuesday, and today 
became the second foreign private citizen to address a joint meeting of 
Congress, the first since the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824. 
</P>
<P>
The House chamber was packed with senators, representatives, members of Bush's 
Cabinet, staff members, journalists and even the Soviet ambassador to 
Washington, Yuri Dubinin, who carefully read Walesa's prepared text and 
applauded the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa entered the chamber at 11:04 a.m. and received a five-minute standing 
ovation punctuated by a few whoops and whistles as he flashed his trademark "V" 
for victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa clearly relished his warm welcome as a representative of Polish 
democracy before "Congress, which for many people in the world, oppressed and 
stripped of their rights, is a beacon of freedom and a bulwark of human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
He began his remarks with the opening words of the preamble to the U.S. 
Constitution, "We the People . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not need to explain that I, an electrician from Gdansk, am also entitled 
to invoke them," Walesa said.

Pope John Paul II today pledged the church's support for AIDS patients, but he 
said people must change high-risk life styles and not resort to "morally 
illicit" means of prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"In its heart the church not only pronounces a series of 'noes' to certain 
types of behavior but especially proposes a life style that is wholly 
signifcant for the person," the Pope said in the closing address of a three-day 
Vatican conference on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
While he did not mention the word "condoms," church officials said it was clear 
that John Paul was ruling out their use as a means of checking the spread of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul noted that AIDS can often be attributed to the "phenomena of drug 
addiction and abuse of sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
"The necessary prevention against the threat of AIDS is not inspired by fear, 
but instead by the choice of a healthy, free and responsible life style," he 
said.

EAST WARY OF WEST GERMAN AID OFFER

<TEXT>
<P>
East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss West Germany's offer of 
massive financial aid, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to 
German reunification and sharply criticized Westerners who suggest that 
socialism has failed. 
</P>
<P>
Activity on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate at dawn suggested that an 
early opening of the symbol of German unity as an East-West crossing point was 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no signs of construction work on the eastern side of the Berlin 
Wall, and West German police said their East German colleagues had told them 
not to expect an opening during the course of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the Brandenburg Gate is clearly a sensitive one for East Germany, given 
the symbolism of the six-column Grecian arch, scene of Prussian and Nazi 
triumphal parades. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are likely to be playing a significant role 
in East-West negotiations about opening the gate, which spans the main trunk 
road through the heart of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung 
that East Germany can manage its own economic recovery, an indication that 
Bonn's conditional aid offer may be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or external financial 
situation" of East Germany, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Bauern Echo, aimed at East Germany's farmers, warned 
of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout," the paper declared. 
"Yes to meeting again, no to reunification. The two German states are 
politically and economically too diverse." 
</P>
<P>
There was no official response from the government to West Germany's offer, 
which would require East Germany's ruling Communists to fundamentally reform 
their centrally planned economy. Communist officials have made it clear that 
they do not favor a full free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev for the second day warned Westerners not to expect German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking about reunification would mean interference in the affairs of West 
Germany and of the German Democratic Republic," Gorbachev said in a speech to a 
student meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said Westerners who claim the changes in the East signify the failure 
of socialism are engaging in "wishful thinking." He did not say who he was 
referring to. "We are expanding the potential of the socialist social system," 
he said.

Researchers said today that a new drug dramatically slows the progression of 
Parkinson's disease and should be used in all patients with early stages of the 
debilitating nerve illness. 
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary results of a large-scale study, the researchers said the 
drug deprenyl delays the onset of advanced symptoms of Parkinson's by at least 
one year and is remarkably safe. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that mostly strikes 
people over 40. About 500,000 Americans suffer from it. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly recommend that all patients with early Parkinson's be considered 
for this therapy," said Ira Shulson, a neurologist at the University of 
Rochester in Rochester, N.Y., and the study's principal investigator.

A state appeals court today threw out Ohio's convictions of former Home State 
Savings Bank owner Marvin Warner and a former president in connection with the 
thrift's collapse in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Both Warner and David Schiebel have been free on bond appealing their March, 
1987, convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati-based Home State collapsed in 1985, triggering Ohio's 
savings-and-loan crisis of that year. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals also threw out a 
lower court's order that Warner pay $22 million in restitution to Ohio and 
$250,000 in prosecution costs, and that Schiebel pay $25,000 in prosecution 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said the cost and restitution penalties were based on a 
statement of fees submitted by the state that had not been certified as correct 
and legal by the prosecutor or by the clerk of the Hamilton County Common Pleas 
Court.

SAFEGUARDS URGED IN PENSION FUND ASSETS; 
</P>
<P>
RETIREMENT: THE CHAIRMAN OF A HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR PROTECTIONS AS HEARINGS 
OPEN ON POTENTIAL FRAUD AND MISMANAGEMENT OF SAVINGS.

The chairman of a House panel today called for stronger measures to protect 
private pension fund assets so workers do not lose their retirement savings to 
fraud and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
"We must develop greater safeguards to adequately protect the nation's private 
pension fund assets," Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.) said as he opened a 
hearing by the House subcommittee on retirement income and employment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our workers and retirees have a right to expect that the pensions they have 
worked so hard to earn and which they are counting on to meet basic living 
expenses during their retirement years are not eroded away by waste, fraud and 
corruption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing stemmed from reports issued by the Labor Department's inspector 
general office that pointed to the vulnerability of $2 trillion in assets of 
pension plans covering 76 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The latest inspector general's report, obtained by the Associated Press, says 
billions of dollars in private pension money is not being fully audited because 
the money was invested in such institutions as savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Some Labor Department officials dispute the extent of the problems, saying the 
department's acting inspector general, Raymond Maria, has exaggerated the 
potential for fraud. Maria has likened the potential to the recent savings and 
loan crisis, which some estimates say will require a $100-billion taxpayer 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
David George Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits, 
told the hearing: "The pension system, by any objective measure, has never been 
healthier." 
</P>
<P>
Maria, in his testimony, said, "Our goal is not to unnecessarily frighten 
people but to stimulate concern where such concern is needed and to avoid 
potential future crisis." 
</P>
<P>
He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than criminal 
remedies have "created a window of opportunity for those who would embezzle and 
steal from plan participants."

South Korean car exports dropped 36.5% to 276,059 in the first 10 months of 
1989, compared with the corresponding 1988 period, the Korea Automobile 
Manufacturers' Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at home, however, rose 47.4% to 615,640 in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor strife, the appreciation of the local currency and higher wages, as well 
as an insufficient supply of new models, are to blame for the fall in exports," 
an association spokesman said.

The West European airplane consortium Airbus Industrie said today it has 
reached a preliminary agreement with the Soviet state airline Aeroflot on the 
purchase of five Airbus A-310 airliners and options for five more. 
</P>
<P>
A banking source said the preliminary agreement was dependent on Aeroflot 
obtaining bank financing for the purchase from the consortium of aerospace 
firms in West Germany, France, Britain and Spain. The source said Aeroflot 
would need to obtain a servicing agreement with a Western airline. 
</P>
<P>
An Airbus sale to East Germany's Interflug airline last year was cleared by the 
West's export control body COCOM on condition the planes were serviced in West 
Germany. The Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls scrutinizes 
all exports to the East Bloc to prevent the diversion of sophisticated 
technology to military ends.

Responding to the recent shake-ups among classical music stations in Los 
Angeles, KCSN-FM, a tiny public radio station licensed to Cal State Northridge, 
changed from a country music format today to classical music. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity in the marketplace obviously is the reason for the change," 
said KCSN (88.5) General Manager Ken Mills. "There are very few windows of 
opportunity such as this for a small public station to take on a major format. 
The recent demise of KFAC (which changed to a rock format on Sept. 21) and the 
fine-tuning and fluctuations at (public station) KUSC have made it possible for 
us to consider and now do a classical format." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he plans to hire some former KFAC announcers and possibly some from 
KUSC for the new format that was scheduled to debut at 1:05 p.m. today with 
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. KCSN has a relatively weak signal strength (52 
watts) and principally serves the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys.

RINGO STARR WINS BID TO BLOCK ALBUM

<P>
Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr won a permanent injunction today, blocking the release of 
an album he recorded for a Georgia record producer while under the influence of 
alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper issued the injunction 
shortly before a trial on a suit over the album was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was scheduled to be the first witness in the case. Dozens of fans crowded 
the second floor of the Fulton County Courthouse in the hope of catching a 
glimpse of the drummer and his wife, actress Barbara Bach. 
</P>
<P>
There were to have been two questions to be resolved in the trial, one of which 
was how much money Starr will have to pay to keep the album from being 
marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Starr's attorney, Robert Fleming Jr., said attorneys for producer Chip Moman 
were asking for $146,000, the amount of money they claim to have spent to 
prepare the album for release. Fleming said Starr had wanted to pay no more 
than $80,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The trial also was to have resolved whether the producer can release two more 
albums recorded by Starr during sessions in Memphis, Tenn., in February and 
April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Moman, the head of CRS Records in College Park, Ga., said he has enough 
material for two more albums, a claim disputed by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
Starr does not want any material released from the recording sessions because 
he says the music is of poor quality. In depositions filed earlier, the 
ex-Beatle said he and Moman drank large quantities of alcohol and smoked 
marijuana during the recording sessions. 
</P>
<P>
He said the alcohol and drugs had a negative effect on the quality of the 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Starr said he spent five weeks at a clinic in Arizona in October, 1988, for 
treatment of

HOLY RECORD SALES! BAT FANS SWARM STORES TO CAPTURE 'BATMAN' VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hundreds of Bat fans fluttered around Tower Video in West Hollywood late 
Tuesday, waiting for midnight so they could swoop in and pick up the first 
available copies of "Batman -- The Videocassette." 
</P>
<P>
A spotlight outside the store cast the Batman logo on the sky above Sunset 
Boulevard while the Batmobile rolled up and the Joker jumped out, bearing bags 
filled with the coveted Bat videos. 
</P>
<P>
While Batman fans in Los Angeles were waiting for the midnight madness to 
begin, their counterparts on the East Coast -- where midnight came three hours 
earlier -- were already home with their videos. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold 100 within the first 40 minutes. It's kind of slowed down a bit now, 
but the first 40 minutes were pretty much non-stop," said Todd Gerber, 
department supervisor at Tower Video in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
As the videocassette went into national release at midnight Tuesday, its 
expected blockbuster sales were making some in the entertainment industry as 
grim as the Caped Crusader himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" is still playing in more than 500 North American theaters, according 
to the latest box-office figures. The hit movie's speedy arrival in cassette 
form could mean those cinemas are out of luck -- and customers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look at the lines in the video stores and think that those people 
would be going to the theaters if that were the only source for the movie," 
said Randy Hester, an executive of the 640-theater Cinemark U.S.A. chain in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"The video release will really hurt discount houses, where 'Batman' is now 
playing," said Hester. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Home Video is releasing "Batman" five weeks ahead of the standard 
six-month period between a film's theatrical debut and video premiere. "Batman" 
is the fifth most successful film in box-office history, with grosses in excess 
of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said last month that it was releasing "Batman" early because of 
consumer inquiries and market research. 
</P>
<P>
Other 1989 hits such as "Ghostbusters II" and "When Harry Met Sally . . . " 
also are being rushed to video ahead of the usual wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" carries a suggested retail price of $24.98, and sales are expected to 
challenge the record of 15 million copies held by "E.T." Warner Home Video has 
refused to say how many tapes it is shipping.

A bill that seeks to increase competition in the cable television industry 
through federal regulation was introduced today by 15 senators. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsors said they were acting in response to sharp increases in cable TV 
rates and rising complaints about service since the industry was largely 
deregulated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"The growing concentration of ownership in the cable television marketplace has 
led to charges of unfair competition," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz). 
</P>
<P>
McCain said rates were up an average 29% nationally in the past three years 
with many areas even higher. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would prohibit cable programmers from discriminating against cable 
competitors, such as microwave broadcasters and satellite dish owners, and 
would limit the size of multiple cable system operators to 15% of the nation's 
cable subscribers.

LIZ SMITH: FRIENDS STICK BY DELTA THROUGH THIN AND THICK

"I WANT to go after all the tabloids and sleezoids who seem to be saying if you 
are beautiful and you get fat, you no longer have a right to live," says 
producer and chief writer of "Designing Women" Linda Bloodworth-Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Linda was addressing the everlasting, on-going issue of F-A-T, which has beset 
her popular hit TV series on CBS in the person of one of its stars, the divine 
Delta Burke. This unusual and gifted comic actress has, as this column remarked 
the other day, made herself practically a legend of our time via her character, 
Suzanne, the Southern beauty queen who lives for her image, wreaks havoc on the 
men in her life and provides a saucy antidote to the more sensible, reasonable 
characters of the other three "designing women" -- Julia, Mary Jo and Charlene 
(played by Dixie Carter, Annie Potts and Jean Smart). 
</P>
<P>
DELTA, LIKE 80% of the women in America, struggles constantly with her weight 
in real and professional life. But after her recent marriage to actor Gerald 
"Major Dad" McRaney, it became a real problem for Delta. The show's producers, 
however, insist that the tabloids are 100 percent wrong in reporting they ever 
told Delta to "shape up or get off the show." It was simply Delta's OWN 
obsession and problem that worried her so much. She became frantic and it 
affected her work. The producers told their star to relax. They even echoed a 
thought expressed here -- that getting plumper only made the narcissistic 
character funnier and more interesting. But Delta couldn't cope. So she was 
suspended for her own good with the hope that she'd get easy about it all. 
Then, the other day, Bloodworth-Thompson called in her four stars and read them 
a script she'd written which deals with F-A-T. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Delta jumped up, ran across the room and planted a big kiss 
on her producer-writer. The episode, titled "Big," will deal with the issue 
head on and is set to air Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKING OF the tabloids, here is a note from the Star's editor, Dick Kaplan: 
"Dear Liz, we'd be glad to put Ken Wahl on the cover with a story on how he's 
getting fat, but it wouldn't sell a copy. Believe me, both here and elsewhere 
at magazines appealing to women, I've tried diet stories starring male 
celebrities. With zero results. As for Delta Burke, we stand by our story, as 
painful as it was." 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about the split in the long, deep friendship between Nancy 
Reagan and Mike Wallace. (It was Mrs. Reagan's late mother who was Mike's 
original pal, but he developed a deep affection for the first lady.) So, when 
Mike's interview about Mrs. R's book, "My Turn," appeared on "60 Minutes," many 
people began to congratulate Mike on how "tough and aggressive" he'd been with 
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
When this happens, Mike looks sincerely pained. He insists his feelings for the 
former first lady have not changed. He sings her praises, remarking: "She is 
simply a really wonderful lady; loyal, vulnerable and terrific." But he knows 
that the manner of the cutting of his interview by "60 Minutes" makes his 
questions seem rather abrupt. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mrs. Reagan has not returned Mike's recent call to her. She has told 
intimates, "He betrayed me!" She also said to producer Rich Bonin when the 
interview ended: "I think this was better for you than it was for me!"

The other actresses performed risque, off-camera gags to make Dolly Parton 
laugh during a scene in "Steel Magnolias," according to Sally Field. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one scene where Dolly was by herself, and she was supposed to be 
looking off-camera and giggling," Field said in December's Redbook. 
</P>
<P>
"To help her laugh, we did things that would have caused us to be blackmailed 
forever! . . . They should have filmed us and released the footage to porno 
shops. The crew crawled away in mortification," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parton said the director, Herbert Ross, seemed to have a hard time adjusting to 
the predominantly female cast, which also includes Shirley MacLaine, Olympia 
Dukakis and Daryl Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was really scared working with all these women -- scared that we'd 
all have PMS (premenstrual syndrome) at the same time!" Parton said. "Herbert 
was hard on me because I wasn't as skilled in acting as the others. He told me 
I couldn't act." 
</P>
<P>
Parton, characteristically, handled the criticism with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Well, hell, I know I can't act. It's your job to teach me how. You 
hired me to make money for you.' "

Peggy Fleming, who won a gold medal in figure skating at the 1968 Winter 
Olympics, says she no longer skates -- even recreationally. 
</P>
<P>
She said she gets exercise from walking, a little running and a new interest: 
weight training. 
</P>
<P>
She said she does the weight training with a girlfriend and this arrangement 
helps stimulate her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think having a friend will make you stick to an exercise program a little 
better, maybe even motivate you to get started," she said Tuesday. "It's a 
commitment. You don't want to let your friend down." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, 41, of Los Gatos, was in Memphis on a promotional tour for support 
hose.

Battling the bulge while in the public eye hasn't been easy, talk-show queen 
Oprah Winfrey said today, acknowledging she has regained 17 of the celebrated 
67 pounds she lost last year. 
</P>
<P>
"You order a side dish and they call 911 on you," she told her television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time Winfrey ordered apple pancakes in a restaurant and 
"read about it in two newspapers the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey, who has not revealed either her "before" or "after" weight, shed her 
pounds with a liquid-protein diet. Exactly a year ago, she showed off a new, 
svelte self in tight-fitting jeans as her national audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Her luck with losing was national news and in August, Winfrey's face -- 
superimposed on actress Ann-Margret's hourglass figure -- graced the cover of 
TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Winfrey, 35, commiserated over the difficulties of dieting with a 
studio audience loaded with folks on their way up or down the scale. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing would have pleased me more than to walk off into the sunset in my size 
10 Calvin Klein jeans," she said. "I said it was going to be a struggle and 
Lord knows, it has." 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey said she's managed to keep most of the weight off by exercise and a 
diet low in fat and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey made a final plea: "If you see me out someplace and I am ordering 
pancakes -- just let me do it."

STRATEGIES HURT RICE'S HEISMAN ODDS, HOLTZ SAYS

Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz says he knows that his game strategies diminish the 
chances for quarterback Tony Rice in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Rice has passed little this season, seen most Irish rushing touchdowns executed 
by backs Ricky Watters and Anthony Johnson and stood on the sidelines during 
blowouts while Holtz exercised reserve quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz calls Rice a complete quarterback: a leader, a strong rusher and a 
competent passer when he needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't believe there's any way in the world that we could get the 
statistics for Tony Rice that would impress other people without being 
detrimental to the overall goals of the University of Notre Dame," Holtz said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rice leads Notre Dame this season with 693 rushing yards on 128 carries for 
five touchdowns. He has completed 56 passes in 112 attempts for 969 yards, two 
touchdowns and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"When I reflect upon it, I think we've done the right things," said Holtz, who 
coached flanker Tim Brown to the Heisman two years ago.

VINCENT FALLS TO STAGE AFTER PAYING TRIBUTE TO GIAMATTI

Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, his voice cracking with emotion, lost his 
balance and fell to the stage of Carnegie Hall today during a tribute to his 
predecessor, A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who had just finished an eloquent tribute to his friend, turned from 
the podium to return to his seat and lost his balance. He was helped to his 
feet by Joe DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
"I apologize," Vincent said to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent walks with a cane as the result of a vertebra injury during college and 
the onset of arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel embarrassed," he said later. "I hope I didn't spoil anything." 
</P>
<P>
Just before he fell, Vincent's voice broke during the final part of what was 
called "A Celebration of Bart Giamatti and Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he was the noblest of them all," he said, using words from Shakespeare. 
"Brave, noble Bart, and goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti died of a heart attack on Sept. 1 at his summer home in Edgartown, 
Mass., just five months after becoming commissioner and eight days after he 
banned Pete Rose from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
A succession of speakers praised Giamatti during the 90-minute program. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers were his son, Marcus Giamatti; Joe Garagiola; writers Claire 
Smith and Roger Angell, and Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig. Also on stage 
were American League President Bobby Brown, National League President Bill 
White and Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was a collection of who's who in baseball, filled with owners, 
general managers, scouts, agents, baseball lawyers, arbitrators, television 
executives, and the staffs of the commissioner's office and both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The scene outside Carnegie Hall after the program was one of baseball 
executives milling about on 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, some talking trades 
and contracts.

TEEN DRIVER'S TRAGIC RECORD TOLD

The teen-age driver of the car that struck and killed Olympic swimming champion 
Victor Davis is "shaken" because he was involved in another fatal accident 
earlier this year, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Montreal Gazette reported today that the 19-year-old driver is 
already facing charges of impaired driving from an incident that occurred in 
May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The youth is to stand trial in Quebec Court Dec. 15 on charges of impaired 
driving and driving with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters 
of his blood. He pleaded innocent to the charges at an arraignment in October 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the youth tried in vain to save a close friend who drowned after 
their boat was swamped by waves, lawyer Jeffrey Boro told the Gazette. The 
youth had been piloting the boat before it was swamped, and his friend drowned 
after being unable to swim ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers in the car that struck Davis on Saturday have told a newspaper that 
the young driver had not been drinking.

Kanehira said the five others are Yurii Arbachakov, the 1989 flyweight world 
champion; Alexander Miroshnichenko, the 1989 super heavyweight European
