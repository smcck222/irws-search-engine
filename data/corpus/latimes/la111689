IMMIGRANTS IN POVERTY CLING TIGHTLY TO DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Elsa Saravia left the poverty of her village in the Honduran jungle on a search 
for a new life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But almost a decade later, the 58-year-old, part-time housekeeper's dream home 
has turned out to be a cramped, two-bedroom apartment in the working-class city 
of Bell. She shares living quarters with 11 family members. 
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed of coming to America, but not to live like this," she 
lamented. Her apartment on Flora Avenue has a leaking roof, rotting 
floorboards, a broken toilet and rats. In fact, she said, her hand-to-mouth 
existence in Bell is not much different from her life in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Saravia's story is a familiar one in the predominantly Latino areas of 
Southeast Los Angeles County, where thousands of immigrants have settled. 
</P>
<P>
The stories they tell are full of hope and ambition. They speak of a 
willingness to suffer temporary setbacks to ensure a future for their children. 
</P>
<P>
But if the future looks bright, the present is dim for many immigrants who must 
suffer abject poverty. 
</P>
<P>
On a Bell Gardens street, overlooking the Rio Hondo Golf Course, a young couple 
from Guadalajara, Mexico, live in a leaky, one-room shed that is surrounded by 
foot-high weeds and piles of discarded bricks and lumber. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Madrigal, 18, although pointing out the dirt floor, deteriorating 
wallboard, dangling electrical wires and lack of plumbing, spoke optimistically 
about the couple's efforts to clean up the almost unlivable home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much better than how it looked when we moved in," she said. A year 
ago, the couple moved from a two-bedroom apartment, which they shared with 10 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we have more room," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Romero family, on the other hand, live almost elbow to elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Family members began immigrating to the United States from Leon, Mexico, a 
decade ago. Now, there are more than a dozen family members living together in 
a three-bedroom apartment in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Sofia Romero, whose husband works evenings as a short-order cook, spends her 
late afternoons cooking large pots of beans, rice and meat for the family. 
After a hot meal of caldo, a vegetable and beef-rib soup, the Romero family 
talked about their hopes for a better future and made comparisons between life 
in Mexico and in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said her dream so far has not diminished despite the poverty, the area's 
gangs and drug problems and the questionable immigration status of many family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Her goal is to see her 16-year-old daughter, also named Sofia, graduate from 
high school with honors and become a doctor. "Yes, that is what I want the 
most," the 38-year-old mother of four said. The younger Sofia agrees with her 
mother but scowls in embarrassment over the attention. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Sofia often acts as an interpreter for the family. But as long as 
some members of the family remain in the neighborhood and speak only Spanish, 
there is no need for an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like home here in many ways," said the mother, talking about the Latino 
neighborhood that includes a Tianguis, a popular supermarket that specializes 
in Mexican products. But the money is better. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make $4 an hour here," said cousin Lalo Contrera to the enthusiastic 
agreement of the other young men. "At home, you only make $4 a day." 
</P>
<P>
Romero said she prefers the closeness of the family, despite the overcrowding. 
"They are all here because I want to help them and take care of them," she 
said. "We help each other; we give each other strength."

MORE THAN JUST SPORT OR SPECTACLE, MEXICAN RODEO IS A TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The charro, fancily clad in an outfit that included chaps and sombrero, looked 
worried as he sat atop the bullpen before the charreada (rodeo). 
</P>
<P>
"They're telling me it's my turn to ride him," Heraclio Guitron said, referring 
to Diablo, a gray Brahman bull not known for a playful disposition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, more than 4,000 people were settling into the grandstand of the Pico 
Rivera Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Although his dark eyes revealed no rage, it was clear that Diablo, as he 
jostled his pen mates in the morning sun, was well-named. Guitron would be in 
for a devil of a time attempting to ride the horned, 2,000-pound beast. 
</P>
<P>
Guitron, 24, drives trucks for a living, but his love for horses has made him a 
rodeo devotee since he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come from Mexican parents, it's the way you're brought up," he said. 
"It's a family thing, a tradition. If you like it, you stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
The charreada, the nostalgic national sport of Mexico, involves an exhibition 
of several rodeo events by charros (cowboys), who perform without pay, and 
musical entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
In the crowd on a recent Sunday were people of all ages. Little girls in party 
dresses held the hands of their fathers wearing bandannas and hats. The 
atmosphere, festive with Mickey Mouse balloons, tamales, beer and cotton candy, 
became nostalgic when a band played a song about the north-central Mexican 
state of Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
Charreadas, which have long been held in the Los Angeles area, originated 
centuries ago in Mexico as a test of riding and roping skills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our hobby," explained Sergio Duran, the public address announcer who 
is a disc jockey on KWKW radio. "We enjoy it as much as (Americans) enjoy a 
Dodger game or a Raider game. This is what really identifies Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
It is an expensive hobby for the charros, said Duran, 40, a charro himself. 
"You have to feed your horse and have a place to keep him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his huge sombrero, he went on: "And something like this, you pay 
$350. That's not cheap. And this belt is hand-sewn, very expensive, $300 to 
$400. Every charro has one. You have to look good. You have to have at least 
three or four charro outfits. And a saddle . . . that's another thing." 
</P>
<P>
On one Sunday last summer, there was another attraction at the charreada -- 
singer Linda Ronstadt. She entered the arena on horseback and dressed in a 
white dress and sombrero. 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt delighted the crowd with Mexican songs from her album, "Canciones de 
mi Padre" ("Songs of My Father"). On the record jacket to that album, Ronstadt 
had stated that singing and riding in a charreada was "a cherished dream of 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
From her smile -- and the smiles all around the arena -- it was a dream 
fulfilled.

SEN. TORRES SAYS HE IS ALCOHOLIC, HAS FINISHED TREATMENT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), an influential political leader in the 
California Latino community, said last month that he is an alcoholic and has 
completed a 25-day treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, 43, widely considered one of the brightest and most energetic members 
of the Legislature, said he realized after his second arrest on a drunk-driving 
charge that he is suffering from alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a recovering alcoholic," Torres said in an interview with the Los Angeles 
Times. "I thought I could control it by myself, but this is a disease that you 
can't control by yourself. I wasn't willing to admit that I had a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The East Los Angeles Democrat said that three days after the Legislature 
adjourned Sept. 15 he enrolled as a day patient in Starting Point in 
Sacramento. He said he attended therapy sessions for 25 days and returned home 
at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he attends meetings of a self-help group as part of his recovery. 
He said drinking did not impair his performance as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it didn't affect my performance," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, elected to the Assembly in 1974 and to the Senate in 1982, has been 
considered a rising political star in California and has been mentioned as a 
potential candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oct. 25 interview in his Capitol office, Torres said he has not yet 
assessed the political impact of his second drunk-driving arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a quitter," he said. "I believe that anything can be overcome if you 
are honest and forthright with people, but at this point I am not really 
considering a statewide run. I can perceive only one day at a time. Time will 
tell whether I am a viable candidate down the road anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker was arrested for drunk driving in July, 1987, when his car nearly 
crashed into a Sacramento police vehicle parked with its emergency lights 
flashing. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded no contest, paid an $827 fine and was placed on probation for three 
years. One condition of probation was that he not refuse to take any future 
chemical tests to determine a blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 6, Torres was again arrested on a drunk-driving charge. The arresting 
officer said Torres refused to take a field sobriety examination, "could not 
perform" a breath test and refused to take any other test. 
</P>
<P>
Torres became the second state legislator in recent months to acknowledge 
seeking treatment for alcoholism. The first was Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los 
Angeles), who sought treatment at the end of the summer.

WEEKEND EXERCISE SURGES TO FRONT IN WOMEN'S 'ACTIVE WEAR'; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: FREQUENT FASHION CHANGES AND SHARP PRICING HAVE MADE THE SAN DIEGO 
FIRM A LEADER IN ITS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SPECIALTY CLOTHING FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boosted by a licensing arrangement with ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov, a 
San Diego apparel concern called Weekend Exercise Co. has quietly become the 
nation's leading specialty manufacturer of women's dance, aerobic and exercise 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The company is growing at a 20% annual rate despite a recent leveling off in 
the market after a decade-long boom corresponding to the emergence of aerobics 
and fitness as a national preoccupation. The aerobics and exercise fad gave 
rise to a whole new genre of comfortable, form-fitting and stylish apparel 
that, for lack of a better term, has come to be known in the trade as "active 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Weekend's Marika, Baryshnikov and Jazzercise lines should exceed 
$50 million this year, or about 38% of the estimated $130-million women's 
active wear market as a whole, president Arthur Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson, 63, is a long-time San Diegan who co-founded Weekend in 1982 with 
retailer Ed Berner and Norm Zwail, who formerly was Danskin's sales 
representative for Southern California. Weekend Exercise now has 150 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend Exercise made its initial splash in 1983 with the introduction of the 
Marika line at prices 20% to 30% under competing lines. Weekend accomplished 
the price reductions by becoming the first active-wear company to move its 
manufacturing offshore, specifically to low-cost plants in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the line caught the notice of international star Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who in 1986 went to the company and proposed a cooperative 
agreement to introduce a higher priced Baryshnikov signature line of dance and 
exercise wear. Baryshnikov chose Weekend after querying retailers and dancers 
as to who the quality clothing makers were. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Baryshnikov and Weekend signed a licensing deal calling for 
Weekend to manufacture clothes bearing Baryshnikov's name. Three years later, 
the Baryshnikov line is doing $15 million in sales and accounting for 30% of 
Weekend's revenue. Sales of the Baryshnikov line have grown at a 30% to 40% 
clip per year since introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov has final say over design of the line and visits Weekend's Spruce 
Street office two to four times a year to review new products, Levinson said. 
Baryshnikov was performing in Belgium this week and unavailable for comment, 
but Debra Joester of Hamilton Projects, Baryshnikov's New York-based licensing 
agent, said the "timing and chemistry of the agreement have been perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov is "delighted with the product and very pleased with the sales," 
Joester said, noting that the line has expanded from the classic ballet styles 
originally envisioned by Baryshnikov to include more casual dancing apparel. 
Capitalizing on the clothes' crossover appeal as casual attire, Weekend and 
Baryshnikov are in the process of introducing a new line of street wear. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekend-Baryshnikov team's "timing was right for their type of product 
because body wear and leg wear have expanded beyond the old notions of dance 
wear," said Karen Monget, a news editor at Women's Wear Daily. "There are so 
many crossover trends. A lot more people are wearing body-wear pieces as outer 
wear these days." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend's Marika has steadily grown in popularity to the point that is the 
largest-selling mid- to upper-priced trademark in women's exercise wear in the 
nation. It is sold in specialty dance and exercise clothing shops as well as in 
department store chains including the Broadway, Emporium-Capwell, 
Bloomingdale's, Macy's and sporting goods chains including Oshman's and 
Sportmart. 
</P>
<P>
"They forced a lot of other body-wear manufactures that had long enjoyed 
dominant positions to scramble and drop their prices as well," said Sally Goll, 
executive editor of Sportswear International, a New York-based fashion trade 
publication that focuses on the casual sportswear market. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike a lot of moderately priced lines that are moderately designed as well, 
they combine fashion with a very sharp price point," Goll said, a reference to 
Weekend's "very close to the bone" prices. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson was wrapping up a 30-year career as an apparel and sundry importer in 
1982 and considering retirement when old friend Ed Berner, founder of Fashion 
Conspiracy retail chain, approached him about forming a "low-key business" 
together. One possible venture, above several other ideas, struck them as 
particularly promising. "We became aware of the growth in the aerobics wear 
industry, that the goods were primarily being made in Southern California and 
that the people involved did not have real heavy business backgrounds," 
Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
All three factors combined to spell a business opportunity for Levinson, who 
had spent much of his career learning the ins and outs of offshore 
manufacturing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. If aerobics wear was being 
made stateside, Levinson knew he could produce similar clothing at 
substantially lower cost offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Weekend Exercise was born with the prime objectives being to have fun and 
not work too hard, Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson and Berner ran their aerobics wear idea past Norm Zwail, then a 
frustrated regional sales representative for Danskin, which at the time was a 
dominant dance wear manufacturer but losing market share. Zwail, who knew the 
Southern California exercise wear market as well as anyone, thought Weekend's 
idea was sound and joined the company as a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a heavy-duty pay cut," Zwail said Wednesday. "I went backwards to go 
forward, and the gamble paid off." 
</P>
<P>
To project a fashion-conscious image, Weekend also committed itself at the 
outset to offer up to five new fashion looks per year, more than the two or 
three new looks then being offered by active-wear manufacturers. (Weekend now 
introduces new fashions almost monthly.) 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that Weekend's Marika line has been able to respond much 
more quickly than most competitors to changes in styles, according to Bill 
Schaaf, senior vice president and general merchandise manager at 
Emporium-Capwell department stores in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical fitness market is constantly looking for new things," Schaaf 
said. "They are fashion-conscious people," he said of aerobics clothing buyers. 
Weekend "can deliver it very fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales started slowly but gathered momentum as the Marika line demonstrated 
quality as well as price advantage, Levinson said. The company weathered a 
potential crisis in 1984 when Jane Fonda's signature line of women's athletic 
wear was introduced, casting doubt on whether Fonda would leave "room for a 
schleppy little company like ours." But the Fonda line soon faltered, and 
Weekend survived to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
Berner sold his interest last year as part of a recapitalization of the 
company, and new investors include prominent San Diegans whom Levinson declined 
to identify. One investor he did name was Thomas Volpe, a San Francisco 
investment banker who formerly was a top-level executive at Hambrecht &amp; 
Quist investment bankers, well-known for helping start up many Silicon Valley 
high technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Volpe said he invested in Weekend because of his belief in 
Levinson's integrity and because the "company never seems to stand still. They 
are always thinking of new things to do, and that's why they have grown as well 
as they have."

* Mature choices: A new survey says most of the nation's governors recall their 
favorite reading as kids to be typical children's books such as "Huckleberry 
Finn," "The Little Engine That Could" and "Peter Rabbit." But not George 
Deukmejian. California's Republican governor lists his three favorite childhood 
books as "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Making of the President" and "The Book of 
Common Prayer." The survey by a national pizza chain was released Wednesday to 
observe National Young Reader's Day. 
</P>
<P>
* It's over: Gov. Michael S. Dukakis conceded for the first time that the 
Massachusetts Miracle that nearly carried him to the White House is no more. 
But the former Democratic candidate for President said that the formula that 
produced a white-hot economy in the early 1980s can bring Massachusetts back 
from the brink of recession. "The miracle of the '80s may be over, but the 
fundamental strengths that made it happen are still here," he said. Declining 
revenue has left Massachusetts with a $720-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
* One more time: Actor Todd Bridges will be retried on a felony assault charge 
stemming from a shooting at a South-Central Los Angeles drug den, a spokeswoman 
for the district attorney's office said. Bridges, 24, was acquitted last week 
of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter in the Feb. 2 shooting 
of convicted drug dealer Kenneth (Tex) Clay, but jurors deadlocked on the 
assault charge. Bridges played Willis on the TV series "Diff'rent Strokes."

SOCIETY: KOOP JUST WHAT FUND-RAISER FOR HOSPICE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wearing the instantly recognizable, steel gray beard that makes him look a 
cross between Abraham Lincoln and Captain Ahab, former Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop marched into the Admiral Suite at the San Diego Marriott, cast a 
stern eye over the crowd and then relaxed when asked if he really liked to be 
called "Chick." He does. 
</P>
<P>
Among those invited to address Koop by his nickname last Saturday were 
philanthropist Joan Kroc and banker Gordon Luce, who served as general chairman 
and dinner chairman of the San Diego Hospice testimonial at which Koop was 
presented the institution's Humanitarian of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
Invitations to the private, predinner reception were limited to about 50 or so 
top patrons of the fund-raiser, which broke its own records by attracting 
nearly 800 guests and raising more than $195,000 for the acute-care center. 
Karon Luce, who coached her husband on a few party-giving details, said of the 
event: "It was the easiest sell in town, not just because everybody wanted to 
hear Dr. Koop, but because it's such a wonderful charity. Anybody may need to 
use the hospice one day." 
</P>
<P>
Koop, who spent part of the day visiting a home-bound hospice patient before 
cruising on Kroc's yacht (Kroc is largely underwriting the cost of building the 
facility, under construction on Vauclain Point) and changing into black tie for 
the dinner, was described as "so accommodating" by hospice foundation board 
chairman Murray Galinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I just met Dr. Koop this morning, and what a delightful human being he is," 
Galinson said. "He's so caring, it's a delight to be in his presence." 
</P>
<P>
One of those so delighted was columnist Abigail Van Buren, perhaps better known 
as Dear Abby, who advised Koop to continue to counsel the country on its major 
health concerns. Among others with whom Koop chatted quietly were his wife, 
Betty, Kim and Marilyn Fletcher, Iris and Matthew Strauss, Malin and Roberta 
Burnham, Anne and Bill Otterson, Peggy and Peter Preuss and 1988 Humanitarian 
of the Year Bill Cleator with his wife, Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
The accolades flowed at the dinner proper, which jammed the San Diego Ballroom 
with an over-flow crowd that applauded when Rabbi Michael Sternfield said that 
Koop has "the passion of the ancient prophets," and again when Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, referring to the former surgeon general's outspoken efforts against 
the AIDS epidemic, called him "one of the courageous leaders of our time." 
</P>
<P>
After an interlude filled by the Steven Spencer Orchestra, a chicken Wellington 
and bananas Foster dinner and a video presentation that featured remarks by 
Ronald Reagan, Jonas Salk and Barbara Walters, Koop managed to get the last 
word. 
</P>
<P>
Having just accepted the award presented by Kroc, Koop said that he had never 
considered himself a humanitarian, but allowed that the shoe probably fit. He 
spoke at length about his landmark career as the first surgeon to limit himself 
to a children's practice (it was said earlier that his proudest moment came 
when he separated a set of Siamese twins and "allowed them to lead lives of 
their own"), and as one of the first doctors to recognize that children can 
develop cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he did regard his eight years in Washington as the topper to 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a marvelous career as a pediatric surgeon that I thought nothing could 
beat," said Koop, "but my time as surgeon general did." 
</P>
<P>
Among those joining in the standing ovation that followed were Roger and Ellen 
Revelle, John and Marcia Trombold, master interior decorator Steve Chase (who 
has charge of Joan Kroc's new North County mansion); weight-loss czarina Jenny 
Craig and her husband, Sid; Doug and Betsy Manchester; Frank and Lee Goldberg; 
Dean and Marie Dunphy; Cliff and Ruth Grobstein, and Joan Embery, who brought 
along a toucan from the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The Koop testimonial was the second such event to break its own records last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a local Who's Who roster of nearly 800 turned out at the San Diego 
Hilton to honor Larry and Junko Cushman at the 13th annual "A Tribute to the 
Golden Years" dinner, given by Senior Adult Services to benefit its countywide 
Meals-on-Wheels program. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Thornton, who co-chaired the event with her husband, John, said "We've 
broken all records for Meals-on-Wheels dinners, and I understand the Hilton has 
never served so many meals to one group. And we expect tonight to be our most 
financially successful." Proceeds were expected to exceed $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
The guests seemed inclined to grant the records, but to dispute their exact 
cause. Overall credit was given to the honorees, although Larry Cushman, a 
member of one of the county's oldest families, said, "I'm pleased to be here 
tonight, but you know, they're not here for us, they're here for 
Meals-on-Wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Tawfiq Khoury, with his wife, Richel, a long-time pal of the Cushmans, 
disagreed. "These two people not only give money, which is the easiest thing 
you can give, but they give of themselves." (Marion Bourland added another 
point of view, saying, "The real reason the Cushmans are being honored is 
because they're so damn cute!") 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements ended, however, when Carrie Nordby, a 100-year-old Norwegian 
immigrant and a current Meals-on-Wheels client, was invited to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
"Meals-on-Wheels keeps me happy," she said in a fluttery but clear voice that 
resounded through the room. "To see those bright faces bringing in those meals 
just makes my day every day." 
</P>
<P>
Meals program executive director Barbara Bright said that about 300,000 hot 
lunches and cold suppers are delivered annually, by a volunteer force that 
numbers roughly 1,600, to several thousand seniors who no longer can cook for 
themselves. The program receives no public funds, and is supported by donations 
and by subsidized fees from clients who can afford to pay; those who cannot 
afford the service receive it free. 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors stay independent because of San Diegans helping San Diegans," Bright 
said. "The proceeds we earn tonight will keep our meals program on wheels." 
</P>
<P>
The Cushmans' many civic ties and their intercultural marriage (Junko was born 
in Japan's Nagano prefecture; her parents, Takehiko and Yaeko Sano, flew over 
for the event) were represented by the ecumenical nature of the event. Rev. 
Akio Miyaji, minister of the Buddhist Temple of San Diego, offered the 
invocation, and Rabbi Lenore Bohm of Temple Solel in Encinitas the blessing 
over the meal. Msgr. Joseph Carroll of the St. Vincent de Paul Center gave the 
benediction as a special favor to Larry Cushman, who is chairman of the 
center's board. 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance of the tribute, Cushman told the audience, "We are all here 
tonight because we believe in the same value of caring for the seniors in our 
community. They all are members of our extended family." 
</P>
<P>
However, it fell to Junko Cushman to bring down the house. "For my old age, I 
have a plan," she teased. "No. 1, I'll get a face lift. No. 2, I'll get 
Meals-on-Wheels. And No. 3, if my husband ever falls in love with someone 
younger and prettier, I'll do the same!" 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Helen and Elliott Cushman, Richard and Harriet Levi, 
Liz and Joe Yamada, Norma and Sam Assam, City Councilmen Wes Pratt, Ron Roberts 
and Bruce Henderson; Ross and Betty Tharp; Barbara Bry and Patrick Kruer; 
Lillian and William Fishman; Carol and Mike Alessio; Norma Hirsh; Jan Madigan, 
and Joy and Merl Ledford.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: IT'S ALL RIGHT TO BE LEFT-HANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Even though our son has always been encouraged and has never 
(as far as we know) been made to feel strange or inferior because he's 
left-handed, he still makes comments about it and wishes he were right-handed. 
Since he's 19 and an excellent student who seems to be adjusted in other ways, 
we're wondering if he'll ever accept this condition. -- A.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.Y.: There's no doubt about it that, in a world designed primarily for 
right-handed people, lefties can often feel they're getting a raw deal or that 
they've been treated unfairly. However, most adjust very well and consider it a 
minor irritation. 
</P>
<P>
You might remind your son that many people who have made lasting contributions 
in many different fields have been lefties. Michelangelo, Babe Ruth, Thomas 
Edison, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Paul Klee, Cole Porter, Charlie Chaplin, 
Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, even Paul McCartney, Sandy Koufax and Jimi 
Hendrix were all left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
It's important for all children to be taught that it's all right to be a little 
different. In some way, each of us is unique and this is one of the many things 
that helps to make the world a better and more interesting place in which to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son is 5 years old and my husband feels there's no reason 
to tell him about the possibility of having a baby sister or brother. Since our 
son will be at my mother's for the last few months of my pregnancy, my husband 
thinks our little boy would have a better time on his holiday if he didn't 
know. Is there anything wrong with letting the new baby be a surprise? -- H.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR H.S.: Yes, there's really a lot wrong with this idea. First of all, 
children have a great need for predictability in their lives. Youngsters are 
amazingly resilient if they know what to expect and if they're properly 
prepared well in advance. Your son has been the center of attention for some 
time and he's now going to have to learn to share the spotlight. This will 
present much less of a problem if you let him know that he'll soon be a big 
brother and encourage him to be an important part of the planning for this new 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
Talk with your son about what he was like as an infant, for this will help him 
to empathize and identify. Once the baby has arrived, make sure you talk with 
your son not only about his feelings but also about how he thinks the baby 
feels. Let your son take part in preparing the baby's room and planning in the 
care and feeding. 
</P>
<P>
I think it would be a good idea if your son could return a short time before 
the birth of this baby. The more he's included, the less likelihood for sibling 
rivalry later.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: JAPANESE POTTERY VARIES IN VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a dessert set marked "Occupied Japan." It is beautiful 
gilt-edge floral china and consists of eight cups and saucers, seven cake 
dishes and a cake plate. What information can you provide about it? -- A.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The "Occupied Japan" label surfaced shortly after World War II when 
Japan's economy was in shambles. In an effort to get back on its feet and to 
acquire badly needed hard currency, Japan's pottery industry produced thousands 
of products. 
</P>
<P>
According to collectors, these objects continued to be marketed until April, 
1952. They had various markings, including "Occupied Japan," "Made in Japan" 
and "Made in Occupied Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The products ranged from ashtrays to china to dolls and mugs. Prices, according 
to dealer catalogues, vary widely but have remained fairly reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in one catalogue we have, cups and saucers were priced at $6 to 
$10 each; teapots, $20 each and up; wind chimes, in the $30 range; creamers and 
sugar containers, depending on the decorations, from less than $10 to more than 
$30; plates, in a variety of shapes and colors, from about $10 to $30 each. 
</P>
<P>
To test whether this collectible is an original or a fake, you can attempt to 
wash off the "Occupied Japan" label. Originals should have the label under 
glaze and you shouldn't be able to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an "FDR-Truman" poster in color. It measures almost 2 feet wide and 
is more than 2 feet long. The red, white and blue poster says: "We Need Them. 
They Need You." What sort of value does it have? -- L.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: That poster, printed for the 1944 Roosevelt-Truman Democratic Party ticket, 
has been listed for $100 and more in various catalogues. Key to this price, of 
course, is its condition -- no tears, holes, smudges or creases. 
</P>
<P>
Most collectors seem to search for items from older political campaigns -- such 
as your poster -- and not just because of the rarity factor. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors say that for one reason or another -- television has a lot to do 
with it -- campaigns of decades past reached out to the public with a much 
greater variety of voter-solicitation items, such as ribbons, pins, cigars and 
pennants, as well as the ubiquitous political button. Many of these items have 
become highly sought after by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
To further your knowledge of political collectibles, your local library should 
have some of the books of Theodore Hake of Pennsylvania, who has written 
extensively on the subject. Among his works is the Encyclopedia of Political 
Buttons.

For Pat Bush of La Jolla, who was in the market for a small soft-serve yogurt 
maker, life should soon again be a soft touch. Earl B. Schuman of Los Angeles 
says that Salton, Inc., makers of Hotray Products, manufactures two sizes of 
small yogurt makers: GM-10 (family size, 2 liters), and GM 5W (1 liter). 
Schuman says he bought his two at ABC Premiums on Beverly Boulevard in Los 
Angeles, but most department stores should carry them. If not, the 
manufacturer's address is: Salton Inc., 1260 Zerega Ave., Bronx, N.Y. 10462. 
Mrs. G. O. Erickson of Ventura says she bought a small yogurt maker at Ventura 
International Cookware &amp; Coffee Center, 337 E. Main St., Ventura. We even 
heard from two readers who had yogurt makers they no longer needed, and we 
forwarded their names to Bush in La Jolla. And Clifford Merry of Los Angeles 
sent us his recipe for do-it-yourself yogurt. If interested, send a stamped, 
self-addressed envelope.

When David (Fathead) Newman had his horns stolen, Hank Crawford and Jimmy 
McGriff became a team. 
</P>
<P>
How did a horn theft lead to a new musical partnership? Saxman Crawford and 
blues organist McGriff, who Wednesday opened a two-week stay at Elario's in La 
Jolla, first played together in Greenwich Village at a benefit three years ago 
to help Newman replace his instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a set that just took the roof off the place," remembers Maxine 
Harvard, who manages both musicians. "Being the promoter/P.R. type I am, I 
said, 'I can't let this go.' " Harvard booked them together at the Apollo 
Theatre, and the duo clicked again. 
</P>
<P>
Both musicians record for Fantasy/Milestone, and, soon after the Apollo date, 
Ralph Kaffel, the company's president, asked them to do an album together. 
</P>
<P>
"Soul Survivors" was released in 1987. Since then, the pair have done two more 
albums, with the latest, "On the Blue Side," scheduled for January release. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff's swinging work on Hammond B-3 organ provides the perfect foil for 
Crawford's funk/blues sax. Crawford might not want to hear it, but McGriff 
lends the music a bluesy fire lacking on some of Crawford's solo projects. 
</P>
<P>
Though both men are blues players at heart, they also have substantial 
background in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go either way," Crawford said. "Most people classify me as R&amp;B or 
blues, but I cut my roots on be-bop, straight-ahead. I'm more comfortable with 
an R&amp;B, blues sound. My approach to horn is actually vocal, a singing, 
melodic sound." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Crawford sang and played piano in church. One of his first jobs 
was backing Ray Charles. He took up alto sax in high school, listening to 
Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford left Charles to record several albums of his own in the '60s, and 
spent the '70s having his sound uncomfortably molded to fit the light, fusion 
mold then in vogue at the CTI label. In 1983, he moved to Milestone and 
returned to his grittier style, and he has recorded regularly with a band 
including Newman and Dr. John since then. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff grew up listening to jazz players such as Archie Shepp and Reggie 
Workman, who lived in his Philadelphia neighborhood. He started on drums, vibes 
and piano, but, when he switched to organ, Jimmy Smith, Richard (Groove) Holmes 
and Milt Buckner became important influences. His first hit was an arrangement 
of Charles' "I've Got a Woman," which reached No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B 
chart in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Both Crawford and McGriff have independent careers and spend about half their 
time playing or recording with each other. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Crawford and McGriff will be backed by drummer John Guerin and 
guitarist Bob Devos. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the swan song sounded for jazz at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach. 
This week, it's more like "Happy Days are Hear Again." 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz aficionado and occasional promoter Bob Geib reports that some local 
musicians have reduced their fees to keep the club alive. This Friday night, 
Geib has lined up saxophonists Rod Cradit and Gary Lefebvre, followed by the 
spicy Latin jazz sounds of Algo Caliente Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon in the larger disco room behind Diego's restaurant, 
clarinetist Bobby Gordon and trumpeter John Best work out with their quartet 
from 2 to 4:30, with special guest Mike Wofford on piano. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for all shows is $5. Those who have a Diego's Loft VIP card get in for 
half price Fridays and Saturdays. Leave your name and address at the door, and 
they will mail you one. 
</P>
<P>
Geib expects jazz to continue at the club for the foreseeable future, but with 
more emphasis on local acts than the nationally known performers featured 
before the owners temporarily shut down to curb their losses. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV (Channel 15) kicks off a new season of "Club Date" jazz programs Friday 
night at 10:30, with a show featuring Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff. It airs 
again Sunday at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS is getting a jump on its national sisters. Most public television stations 
will begin airing the new group of six shows next spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into its second year, the show is gaining a following and improving in 
technical quality, according to producer Paul Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 100 public television stations across the country aired 
"Club Date." For 1989, there are six new programs featuring guitarist Joe Pass, 
trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, Crawford and McGriff, singers Mose Allison and 
Jimmy Witherspoon, and flugelhorn player Art Farmer with saxophonist Clifford 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Sound for this season's shows was recorded on an eight-track machine, so the 
instrumental mix could be polished after the live studio session. Programs are 
broadcast in stereo. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's continues as the show's co-sponsor, with the club's Steve Satkowski 
serving as associate producer. Marshall said each show costs more than $10,000 
to produce; he would like to find a corporate sponsor to pay for programs 
featuring such jazz legends as Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: A clip from a "Club Date" featuring Jimmy Witherspoon may be used when 
the blues singer appears on CBS News's "Night Watch" program tonight. . . . 
Randy Porter, the talented local pianist, is working Monday nights at Elario's 
through December. . . . The San Diego Jazz Orchestra, led by alto saxophonist 
Gary Scott, plays the KSDS-FM (88.3) "Jazz Live" series Tuesday at 8 p.m. in 
the city college theater. You can attend, or listen to the live radio 
broadcast. . . . Guitarist Hank Easton and his Easton West Band are featured 
Mondays through November at Humphrey's on Shelter Island.

Cleveland Ready to Rock 'n' Roll: The group behind Cleveland's effort to be the 
home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame beat a Wednesday deadline to submit a 
funding proposal by presenting a package totaling more than $40.2 million to 
build and support the proposed facility. The package, presented at a Cleveland 
press conference Wednesday morning, includes $28 million in public funding ($18 
million to be raised through a city bond) and more than $12 in foundation and 
corporate support. Among recent private donations was a $1 million offering 
from the band the Who, which was elected to the hall earlier this month. ALEENE

A Brief History of Hawking: Movie-making giant Steven Spielberg will bring his 
Amblin Entertainment company's sense of imagination to "A Brief History of 
Time," a 90-minute television production based on the life of physicist Stephen 
Hawking and his best-selling book about the origins of the universe. The 
project is a co-venture of Anglia Television, Gordon Freedman Productions and 
Amblin. The film will intertwine the story of Hawking -- he mastered the 
disabling disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -- with a visual demonstration 
of his theories about the black hole and the beginning of the universe. Errol 
Morris will direct the production, which is scheduled for completion next fall 
and intended for broadcast in network prime time. ALEENE MacMINN

THERE'S NO ESCAPING 'CRACK HOUSE'S' CLICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perusing the ad copy for "Crack House" (citywide) -- "Getting in is easy, 
getting out is hell" -- it's possible to hope upon hope that this will be a 
picture that blows the filmic lid off the rock-cocaine culture and explains why 
"just say no" slogans cooked up in the White House might not work in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, sure. Just like it's possible to hope that stars Jim Brown or Richard 
Roundtree will ever make a halfway decent movie again. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugstore Cowboy" this isn't. (It's not "Colors," either, though it does at 
least have the nerve to look at the world of gangbangers from their 
perspective, not the cops'.) No, that potentially metaphorical Roach Motel-like 
ad copy about the impossibility of escape is meant quite literally: There's a 
drugged-up damsel in distress being held prisoner in that tightly guarded title 
fortress, white-slavery style, and it's up to the LAPD's battering ram to bust 
her loose. 
</P>
<P>
It's not enough for director Michael Fischa and writer Blake Schaefer to offer 
an exploitative look at Latino and black gangs in Los Angeles warring over 
commercial turf; they must also give us an endangered white chick. This lass 
(newcomer Cheryl Kay) starts off as the good girl -- a budding fashion 
designer, even -- in her interracial high school, but after her ex-gang member 
fiance (Gregg Gomez Thomsen) is jailed for avenging a cousin's death, another 
boy takes her under his coke-laced wing and gets her hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Even a concerned teacher (Anthony Geary) turns out to be a greedy dealer out 
for her bod -- which she starts giving more and more freely, till she winds up 
the battered sex slave of transcendently evil Jim Brown in that rock house. 
More carnage will ensue. 
</P>
<P>
Getting into "Crack House" (rated R for every conceivable reason) is about 
$6.50; getting out is sheer relief. CHRIS WILLMAN

EXUBERANT NEW YORK VOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Voices, a quintet of singers from Upstate New York that opened at the 
Catalina Bar and Grill on Tuesday evening, has borrowed liberally from the 
vocal jazz group tradition. There's a little bit of Lambert, Hendricks &amp; 
Ross, a little bit of Jackie &amp; Roy, some Double Six of Paris and more than 
a sprinkling of the Manhattan Transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Though certainly not lacking its own identity, the group form is so limiting as 
to make New York Voices, first formed as a vocal quartet at Ithaca College, 
sound like most other jazz vocal groups with their overwritten parts, tight 
harmonies, swing rhythms and annoying penchant for a cappella excursions. What 
will distinguish this handsome, exuberant group from the rest of the pack -- 
small, though that pack may be -- is a repertoire that extends beyond the 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
During its opening-night set Tuesday, the group made several strides in that 
direction with a handful of offerings that showed a willingness to do more than 
merely sing a song of Basie. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by singer-saxophonist Darmon Meader, the group opened with a brisk 
rendering of Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's "Caravan." The classic tune, which 
featured the first bit of uninspired scatting (there was too much of it 
throughout the set), was flawed by a sound system that made it difficult, if 
not impossible, to understand the lyrics. That problem persisted throughout the 
set, with the notable exceptions of "Stolen Moments," the group's only ballad 
of the evening, and "Baroque Samba," which was wordless vocalese. 
</P>
<P>
Other instances of seeking higher jazz ground came in the unlikely, but quite 
workable form of "Top Secret," a rock-funk piece from the fusion group the 
Yellowjackets, with lyrics by group member Caprice Fox, and a pair of 
originals, the joyous sounding "National Amnesia" and the rocking "Dare the 
Moon." Again, though, the pieces could be appreciated only for their musical 
value as the lyrics were inaudible. 
</P>
<P>
New York Voice was accompanied capably by pianist Jon Werking, bassist Chuck 
Bergeron, who soloed beautifully on "Stolen Moments," and drummer Tommy Igoe. 
Combined with the tenor saxophone of Meader's and some tasty synthesizer work 
by vocalist Peter Eldridge, the musical backdrops created provided plenty of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Singers Kim Nazarian and, especially, Sara Krieger, provided some superb solo 
moments -- though not enough of them -- during the hourlong opening set. 
</P>

STAGE WATCH : A BLOCK OF TICKETS PROVES TO BE 'PHANTOM'; THEATRE LA TO AWARD 
OVIS STARTING MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Opera Ghost sent us a copy of a letter to the Ahmanson Theatre from a 
teacher unhappy that she had to wait until May, 1990, before she could take the 
50 students in her Fine Arts Club to see "The Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, teacher Loma Karklis of Arroyo High School in El Monte was particular. 
She wanted only the best orchestra seats for her young audience. ("They were 
paying the full $50 price," she reasoned. "Why settle for less?") But what 
angered Karklis was that even though she had approached the theater in April 
about a January date, it would be May -- a full year later -- before her 
request could be honored. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because in January and February blocks of prime orchestra seats have been 
set aside for American Express Gold Card holders and, in March and April, for 
Ahmanson subscribers. As Rosalie Lazarus, the group sales representative for 
"Phantom," explained, that made it difficult to carve out a 50-seat block of 
really good seats. So she recommended May. 
</P>
<P>
A long wait, yes, but ultimately no problem as long as Karklis and her students 
get what they want. But a lot of other people have made their unhappiness known 
about the preferential treatment for American Express Gold Card holders. When 
it was first announced, Tro Konalian of Pasadena complained that "now the 
public is expected to somehow combine the worth of art and their finances." 
Laura Goldman of Redondo Beach called it an "elitist market tactic." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it preferential treatment," said "Phantom" general manager 
Alan Wasser. "We have a longstanding relationship with American Express. What 
we worked out was that they provided certain incentives for us and we provided 
a relatively modest allocation of seats." 
</P>
<P>
What incentives? "They sponsored our opening-night party and placed some 
advertising. We offered them 120 prime seats (per show) over a period of eight 
weeks. Out of 931 orchestra seats and 334 front parquet seats, that's not many. 
Generally, we try to keep seats available for groups, but with 'Phantom,' 
because of the demand, it's been awesome to try to keep tickets out the hands 
of scalpers. At least the seats that went to American Express didn't go to the 
scalpers." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up a whole other issue that won't go away until the theaters 
themselves decide to do something about scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the Hilarions, a.k.a. Gladiators of Comedy (currently at 
Theatre/Theater, Saturdays, 10:30 p.m.), chose to trade on the trauma of 
getting tickets to "Phantom" in a skit called "The Phantom of the Ahmanson." No 
matter how you slice it, it's a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "Phantom of the Opera's" real and quintessential Phantom, 
Michael Crawford, still isn't saying if he'll stay with the show beyond 
February when his contract is up. But people are calling and asking. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they employers?" quipped Crawford over the phone, sounding more earnest 
than Phantomesque. "As I've boringly said, it does depend on health. I'm all 
right now but if I get too tired, I may have to leave the show. I just don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
It's been suggested that Crawford might consider playing six performances a 
week instead of eight, the way Dale Kristien shares the female lead with Mary 
D'Arcy. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do that," said Crawford who has a reputation for being an 
insatiable performer anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have booked ahead expecting to see me and I have a responsibility 
to them. I'm sort of old school about that." 
</P>
<P>
The point exactly. It's the people with tickets in March and April and May who 
call wanting to know if they'll still be getting Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't guarantee that," he said, a bit taken aback. "It's three years that 
I've been with the show." 
</P>
<P>
Does his contract have to be renegotiated in February? 
</P>
<P>
"As a businessman I'm a good mountaineer," Crawford said, without missing a 
beat. "Presumably, if the contract ends then it will have to be a 
renegotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Which may be the real answer to the question. 
</P>
<P>
AND THE WINNER IS . . .: There's a new baby at Theatre LA, the support 
organization for Los Angeles area theaters. It's called the Ovation. OVI, for 
short. 
</P>
<P>
That's the name that won the contest run by Theatre LA for its sculptured 
bronze and gold-leaf award, designed by Robert Graham. (Some people had saltier 
words for the free-form object that looks like a kindergartener's skewed 
rendering of a table lamp.) 
</P>
<P>
Submitted by Ann Sutton of Gardena (her prize: a pair of tickets to shows at 12 
Theatre LA member theaters), OVI, the word, suggests something eggy and 
seminal. This is perhaps not inappropriate, since the newborn will be 
officially christened Monday at the first annual black-tie, star-studded 
Theatre LA Governors Awards at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The time is 8 p.m. Tickets for Theatre LA members are $30 or $50, non-members 
$150 or $500. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 614-0556. 
</P>
<P>
Does Sutton get to go . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
BENEFITS &amp; BOOK SIGNINGS: The Odyssey Theatre Ensemble has been in its new 
quarters at 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. since September, but the official "Opening

out of three shows now at the theater ("Accidental Death of an Anarchist," 
"Nightclub Cantata," "Kvetch") and enjoy a champagne reception/buffet with the

<P>
LATE CUES: Artistic director Gordon Davidson, who has not yet found a suitable 
replacement for the Ahmanson subscribers' bonus event, "Jerome Robbins'

are on sale now for Wednesday's "Pay-What-You-Can" matinee (1:30 p.m.) of 
Manuel Puig's "Mystery of the Rose Bouquet." . . . And a press conference to 
announce the expansion of Crossroads Arts Academy and Theatre and the 
development of a major inner city arts complex in the Crenshaw-Liemert area had

be rescheduled.

CLUES TO CHANDLER'S TROUBLED LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dashiell Hammett in "The Maltese Falcon" gave the world Sam Spade and the 
private detective as a literary sub-genre. Then a curious and troubled figure 
named Raymond Chandler, in a short but blazing series of novels, extended the 
form and became the principal poet of all the knights in frayed trench coats 
walking alone down mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Chandler centenary was widely celebrated in 1988 and one of the events was 
a profile done for Melvyn Bragg's "The South Bank Show" on London Weekend 
Television. Produced and directed by David Thomas, edited and hosted by Bragg, 
"Raymond Chandler" gets its first U.S. showings tonight on Bravo cable at 5 and 
10. It will be shown again at the same hours on Nov. 24 and Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidently no footage on Chandler and only a handful of stills and 
family album pictures. To compensate, Thomas uses actor Robert Stephens to play 
Chandler and to read from his letters and essays. With his horn-rim glasses and 
center-parted hair, Stephens bears a close resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
Although born in Chicago, Chandler did most of his growing up in England after 
his father deserted the family and his mother returned to live with relatives 
in South London. He attended Dulwich College, to which Bragg's camera pays a 
charming visit. One of the dorms is called Marlowe and it seems inevitable that 
that's where Philip Marlowe got his name. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Chandler always felt more a displaced Englishman than a native 
American, although his command of the American vernacular was superb. In his 
early days in London, he wrote standard poetry and sharp-tongued reviews but 
could not make a living at either and ended up as a quite successful oil 
executive in Los Angeles until drinking cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
Adrift in middle age, he started writing for Black Mask and other pulp 
magazines and found what he should have been doing all along. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with his principal biographer Frank McShane, literary historian 
Matthew Broccoli, producer John Houseman, Robert Mitchum (who twice played 
Marlowe) and San Diego columnist Neil Morgan, an acquaintance during Chandler's 
last days in La Jolla, confirm what a troubled life he led. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, 17 years older than he, was an invalid for years. He never conquered 
his problems with alcohol and, after little more than a dozen years of 
brilliant productivity, Chandler seemed a burnt-out case. His last novel, 
"Playback," was not successful, and an uncompleted manuscript, "The Poodle 
Springs Story," lately completed as an homage by Robert B. Parker, had few 
traces of Chandler's earlier energy and bite. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "The Big Sleep," "Farewell My Lovely," "The High Window," "The Lady in the 
Lake" and "The Long Goodbye" may well be the most influential (e.g., imitated) 
body of work in American crime fiction. An impressive list of actors -- 
Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum, Dick Powell, Robert Montgomery, George Montgomery, 
Elliott Gould -- have played Marlowe. And the books as well as the films have 
introduced generations to Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Even now there are streets in Hollywood where the ghost of Marlowe seems to 
reside, although you look in vain for the drive-ins Marlowe used to pass on 
Ventura Boulevard, "offering food that would poison a toad." 
</P>
<P>
It is a melancholy documentary but inescapable for anyone who cares about crime 
fiction and its ongoing debt to Chandler.

Although the holiday season isn't typically a time for undertaking a diet, 
there are those who continue to count calories even at this time of year. There 
are a few who will decide to forget the diet until after the holidays pass, 
then try to make up for lost time (and gained inches). Others may try skipping 
dessert. But is this a realistic option considering the festive mood of the 
holidays? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. That's why desserts that give dieters a clear conscience are in 
order. All the seasonal favorites here, including chocolate treats and pumpkin 
pie, have been trimmed to meet the health needs of today's waistline watcher. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate recipes in particular were designed to meet specific criteria. 
They adhere to the American Heart Assn. dietary guidelines that recommend the 
fat content be kept at 30% of the total day's calories. Each offers a maximum 
of 180 calories, per serving, 20 milligrams or less cholesterol and five grams 
or less fat. 
</P>
<P>
The Apricot-Glazed Cheese Pie has an oatmeal crust that adds just the right 
texture to the orange-flavored cheese filling. Neither has any sugar added. The 
pumpkin pie will not only appeal to dieters but to non-dieters as well. It gets 
its smooth texture from unflavored gelatin and owes its traditional taste to 
pumpkin pie mix. 
</P>
<P>

CULINARY SOS: GRILLED CHICKEN WITH THE HOT, SPICY TASTE OF JAMAICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Do you happen to have a recipe for Jerk Chicken that you'd find in 
Jamaican restaurants? Love to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CLAIRE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CLAIRE: Super idea for Thanksgiving turkey too. Meanwhile, here is the 
recipe for Jamaican Jerk Chicken taken from the Summer 1989 issue of a new 
quarterly ($10.95 for four issues) called "The Whole Chile Pepper," which one 
can subscribe to by writing to Whole Chile Pepper, Out West Publishing, P.O. 
Box 4278, Albuquerque, N. M. 87196. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the recipe is the chile paste used to brush on the chicken. The 
recipe calls for brands of chile salsa, such as 1/4 cup of Inner Beauty or 
other Caribbean hot sauce. You can also buy 10 Scotch Bonnet chiles (Harbanero 
chiles said to be the hottest in the world) and puree them with 1/4 cup yellow 
mustard for the proper effect. Harbanero chiles can sometimes be found in fresh 
form in Mexican and Caribbean markets. If not available, use any hot chile. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chile article, jerk meat dishes were originally created by 
maroons (escaped slaves) in Jamaica, as a method of preserving pork by rubbing 
it with a chile paste then open pit smoking the meat. Pork evolved into 
chicken, which is also rubbed with the same chile mixture but slow-grilled so 
that it develops a rather dried out crusty top, similar to smoked meat. 
</P>
<P>
JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Caribbean hot sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons dried basil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons mustard seeds 
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons chopped green onions 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 2 limes 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons orange juice 
</P>
<P>
Vinegar 
</P>
<P>
6 chicken thighs with legs attached 
</P>
<P>
Combine hot sauce, rosemary, parsley, basil, thyme, mustard seeds, green 
onions, salt, pepper, lime and orange juices and 2 tablespoons vinegar in 
blender container and blend until paste is formed, being sure ingredients are 
well blended. Paste should be consistency of thick tomato sauce. If too thick, 
thin with more vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and let stand in refrigerator 2 hours, or overnight (but not more than 2 
weeks). 
</P>
<P>
Rub chicken with paste and grill over very low coals, uncovered, 1 hour. If 
covered, place coals to 1 side of grill and chicken on other and cook about 1/2 
hour. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: For turkey, use whole turkey or turkey parts. Brush paste as directed. 
Roast at 350 degrees according to time table for turkey. Turkey can be covered 
until almost done, then remove cover to allow skin and paste to crisp. 
</P>

WINE NOTES: BRANDY, MISTELLE OFFERED; REPORT ANALYZES MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Germain-Robin Fine Alambic Brandy, the premium California brandy producer based 
in Ukiah, has released its Lot 5 brandy as well as a new dessert wine, a 
mistelle. 
</P>
<P>
The Lot 5 brandy has an elegant, rich, faintly nut-like aroma with the accent 
on fruit. The finish is creamy and elegant. It retails for $28 and compares 
very favorably with Cognacs that sell for $15 more. 
</P>
<P>
The Mistelle of Cabernet Sauvignon is a grape-like drink that is made by adding 
brandy to unfermented Cabernet Sauvignon grape juice. The taste is fairly 
sweet, but the alcohol is modest, only 17%. Price is $13 a half bottle. Only 
140 cases were produced. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Germain-Robin has released special barrel lots acquired by retail 
accounts and made to their specifications. Among the accounts receiving cask 
lots were the Brentwood Bar and Grill, Wally's in Westwood, the Duke of Bourbon 
in Canoga Park, and the St. James Club in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Innovative Wine Marketing, a Southern California-based retail wine research and 
consulting company, has released the first of five specialty reports on the 
restaurant trade. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, entitled "Scorecard Restaurant Survey," sell for $250. The first 
report, on the restaurants of La Jolla and north San Diego County, analyzes the 
wine market by restaurant, including the price posted at each for each wine and 
has statistical charts to determine what each of the various restaurants is 
charging for a specific product. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the Scorecard reports, call Dan Wilson at (714) 960-1369. 
</P>
<P>
The American Institute for Wine and Food will stage its first International 
Wine Auction this Saturday at the Four Seasons Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the evening will be a Champagne reception, a supper prepared by 
chefs from some of Los Angeles' greatest restaurants, a silent auction of 190 
lots of wine, and the live auction. Dennis Foley of the San Francisco auction 
house Butterfield and Butterfield will act as auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more prestigious lots to be auctioned is a collection of 51 bottles 
and six half-bottles of Meritage wine -- wines conforming to the new 
Bordeaux-oriented standard from wineries belonging to the new Meritage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the event is $250 per person, and proceeds go to the AIWF. 
</P>
<P>
For details contact the AIWF office at (800) 274-2493 or (415) 255-3000.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: CHEESECLOTH LINING SOLVES PROBLEM OF LEFT-BEHIND DRESSING 
IN TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: As the holiday season draws near, I am reminded of the terrific 
hint I received several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid any of the dangers of left-behind dressing in the turkey, first line 
the cavity with cheesecloth, being careful to leave a generous amount outside 
to be tucked in after the dressing has been added. Then add the dressing as 
always -- loosely, as it swells during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the same procedure if you stuff both ends of the turkey. It can be 
removed like a sack and no stuffing is left behind. Of course, the taste isn't 
changed one bit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- C. J., Minneapolis 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Cured hams, smoked turkeys and pheasants have become popular 
holiday gift items, but sometimes the cooking and/or storage instructions for 
these goodies aren't clear or, in some cases, there are no instructions at all. 
</P>
<P>
If you have any questions about conditions or storage of meats or poultry 
received in the mail, call the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 
Meat and Poultry Hotline, (800) 535-4555, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Pacific 
Standard Time. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotline staff has the answers to your questions about the safety of meat 
and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I heat a lot of vegetables and soups in small bowls in my 
microwave. I used to use waxed paper or plastic wrap to cover the dishes until 
recently when I discovered a better way. 
</P>
<P>
I realized my coffee filters were shaped almost perfectly to fit the tops of 
the small bowls. Now I use a coffee filter and the best part is that it can be 
used a couple of times if it doesn't become soiled. It also does not shrivel up 
from the heat like the wrap does. 
</P>
<P>
 -- VERDA, Bradford, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When my younger sister was moving into her first apartment, we 
all wanted to help her set up her new home. We decided to throw her a 
housewarming party. However, many of our family members are on limited budgets 
and unable to buy expensive gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Then I got the following idea. I asked all the invited guests to bring items 
they no longer needed. The items had to be usable and in good condition, just 
"old hat" or not wanted for one reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
She got all types of pots and pans, dishware, silverware and cloth items. She 
also got larger items like a television stand, a bookshelf and even an old 
desk. She got a lot of things for setting up her own little home. 
</P>
<P>
The party was quite a success and she really appreciated the time and effort 
spent in organizing the event. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA, New York, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BARBARA: You sure put on your thinking hat. This is an easy way for 
families and friends to help make an easy transition to a new home. 
</P>
<P>
If there are things that can't be used, please don't forget to donate to your 
local battered women's shelter. They can use all types of household items. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I solved the problem of leftover food storage in my refrigerator. 
There was never enough room with all the different size containers. 
</P>
<P>
Now I've started using the plastic, zipper-top storage bags. They are so handy. 
You can take them right from the fridge to the microwave, and you will be 
surprised at the amount of space this saves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA, Kingsland, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: For anyone who has arthritis or rheumatism, here's a very helpful 
way to get tops off of bottles. Use your hand-held nutcracker. It opens wide so 
you don't have to close your hand tight, and the grooves on it make it grip the 
bottle top so the top comes off easily without a lot of effort on your part. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARJORIE, Bradford, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Before storing your barbecue grill away for the winter months, be 
sure and wash the grate well. An unwashed grate sitting all winter can build up 
bacteria that will cause food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
This happened to my family this past summer. The barbecue grate was not cleaned 
well before storing, and when we brought it out for the first summer barbecue, 
my husband did not wash the grate nor did we use aluminum foil over it. We both 
ended up with food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Even though we now wash the grate after each use, a good rule of thumb is to 
also wash it before using, especially after storage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- EVELYN, Canfield, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I found an excellent way to reduce my weight. Although I may have 
2,000 calories each day, I try to limit them to 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
I bought a small book that lists every kind of food and the calorie content of 
each. On a pad, I keep track of everything I eat at each meal, every day. 
</P>
<P>
You'd be surprised how easy it is to stop eating and snacking when I reach my 
daily limit. Sometimes I stop at 1,700, even 1,200. The pounds come off slowly, 
but they stay off -- it works. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELEN, Yardville Heights, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We had some really bad weather lately and the electricity was off 
from time to time. The other night it was off for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
I am wondering if I should have thrown away the dairy items that were in my 
refrigerator. Do you have any information on how long they can stay in a 
refrigerator with the electricity off and still not spoil? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JODIE, Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JODIE: When electricity goes out, the first thing we do is open the 
refrigerator to check on the items. Well, this is the worst thing to do. You 
should leave the refrigerator door shut to allow the cool air to stay in it. 
</P>
<P>
Generally dairy items will not spoil for four to six hours in an unopened 
refrigerator. You may also want to check the "use by" date. If it's an item 
that is almost out of date, it may not last as long as an item that has a newer 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Some dairy foods are more perishable than others, so if you have any doubts 
about the freshness of an item, toss it. 
</P>
<P>
And next time, don't open that door. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I found a wonderful baking tip. When baking goods for my family, 
I was always concerned with all the sugar that I was adding. 
</P>
<P>
Now I add half sugar and half heat-stable diet sweetener. For most recipes this 
will work. Now I bake more often and feel better knowing that the sugar content 
is not quite so high.

DEAR HELOISE: I received a beautiful bottle of wine for my birthday. I wanted 
to do something with it as a decoration in my kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
There was one thing I had to do first and that was to remove the cork that had 
been pushed into the bottle. I mentioned it to my friend and she said she had 
success with pouring ammonia in the bottle and keeping it in a place with good 
circulation. I tried it and in less then a week the cork had completely 
disintegrated. I cleaned the inside well with soap and water. 
</P>
<P>
I have it hanging on a wall along with other kitchen gadgets and get many 
compliments on the arrangement. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My son plays baseball almost every night with his friends at a 
nearby park. Last night when he played, he had a slight accident and sprained 
his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
When I heard he was hurt I ran to the park, but thank goodness it wasn't bad. A 
neighbor had a zipper-type bag with crushed ice cubes and a towel over it on 
his ankle to reduce the swelling. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that was a clever idea for anyone who doesn't own an ice pack. It 
certainly did the trick until I got my son to a doctor. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've always known white vinegar can be useful for many things, 
but never realized there are hundreds of uses. I'd like to pass on a few. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that most decals and stickers on windows can be removed by putting 
vinegar on them? Paint a few coats on, let soak for a few minutes and the 
stickers will wash off easily. 
</P>
<P>
My husband's lunch box started getting a terrible odor, so I dampened a piece 
of bread with vinegar and put it in the lunch box overnight. I washed it the 
next morning and was surprised to see how fresh-smelling it was. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing I did with vinegar was remove new deodorant stains from my 
husband's shirts. All I did was rub the area before washing them. I'm so happy 
with it I always keep a gallon handy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- M. B., Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My brand-new wooden bread box taints our bread with a terrible 
flavor and odor. Airing hasn't helped any. What else can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JONI, Columbus, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JONI: Most of the bread boxes that have an odor problem are made of pine, 
which has a resin in the wood that gives off the strong smell. If this is the 
case, it may be impossible to get rid of the odor. 
</P>
<P>
You can try putting charcoal in the box for a few days and see if it will 
absorb the odor. You might also want to try an air-tight plastic container that 
would fit inside your bread box to actually hold the bread, with the wooden box 
just being decorative. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get rid of the odor, try to find another use for the bread box. 
They're really attractive in the kitchen and can be used to store things that 
the odor wouldn't be a problem for, such as coupons, stationery or even small 
appliances like your hand mixer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Please settle a question for me. How are potatoes supposed to be 
stored and which type is the best? I'm getting a lot of conflicting ideas from 
my mother and my new mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CONFUSED, Boston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CONFUSED: Potatoes are easy to store. Just keep them in a dark, dry place 
that's relatively cool, about 40 to 50 degrees. Don't put them in the fridge; 
the cold makes the starch change to sugar and that changes their taste and 
texture. Also, don't store them with onions; the moisture from the potatoes can 
cause the onions to start sprouting. 
</P>
<P>
Potatoes will keep for several weeks if you purchase good ones. That means pick 
those that aren't soft, bruised, cracked, wrinkled, sprouting "eyes" or look 
greenish. 
</P>
<P>
As to which one is best, it depends on what it will be used for. There are 
several varieties and each has different characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Russet Burbank potatoes are the large, oblong ones with dark, rough skin. They 
cook up fluffy and make great mashed potatoes and French fries. Idaho russets 
are favorites for baking. California and White Rose all-purpose long potatoes 
are oblong with thin, smooth skin. They're best for roasting, boiling, steaming 
and pan frying. 
</P>
<P>
Round white potatoes, such as all-purpose round, Eastern and Maine varieties, 
also have thin, smooth, beige skins and are used much the same way as the long 
ones as well as in soups and stews. Round red potatoes are perfect for steaming 
or boiling and so are excellent for salads. Always cook them with the skins on. 
</P>
<P>
It's best to cook all potatoes whole with the skins on. They retain more 
vitamins that way. Potatoes are high in Vitamin C and potassium, as well as 
being a great source of fiber and complex carbohydrates.

THE VEGETARIAN: PUMPKIN'S NIGHT OUT AS GNOCCHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite its versatility, creamy texture and high vitamin content, pumpkin seems 
to have been so stigmatized by its annual role as jack-o'-lantern that we 
rarely use it for anything but desserts. After all, how can you get serious 
about a vegetable that virtually invites you to make a face of it? 
</P>
<P>
Here's how: try these rich, chewy gnocchi. And be sure to use a fresh sugar 
pumpkin because canned pulp is too watery to hold the flour and won't work. 
</P>
<P>
PUMPKIN GNOCCHI 
</P>
<P>
1 (2-pound) pumpkin 
</P>
<P>
3 cups unbleached flour, about 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Dash sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup melted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, about 
</P>
<P>
Cut pumpkin in half lengthwise, scoop out stringy pulp and seeds, then cut 
pumpkin into quarters. Fill deep baking dish 1/3 with water. Place quartered 
pumpkin in dish, shell side down. 
</P>
<P>
Cover dish with foil and bake at 375 degrees 45 minutes to 1 hour or until fork 
pierces pumpkin flesh easily. Remove pumpkin from baking dish and allow to 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon pumpkin out of shell and into large mixing bowl. Mash with fork until 
consistency of mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Measure 2 cups pumpkin pulp and place in bowl. Add flour 1/2 cup at time, 
mashing to blend with pumpkin, until dough forms that may be handled. 
</P>
<P>
Take golf-ball sized piece of dough in hands and roll into log shape, about 2 
1/2 inches long. Cut in half and press lightly in center of each to make 
indentation. Place on lightly floured wax paper. Continue until all dough is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Bring large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add gnocchi several at time. 
As soon as gnocchi rise to surface, remove with slotted spoon, allowing water 
to drain well. Place in warm, covered serving dish. Continue until all gnocchi 
have been boiled. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar into melted butter. Toss gnocchi with melted 
butter, then toss again with Parmesan cheese to taste. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Gnocchi may be refrigerated overnight. Boil and butter just before 
serving.

'TIS THE SEASON FOR TALKING TURKEY; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: MEAT AND POULTRY HOT LINE OFFERS ANSWERS FOR COOKING THE BIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans will gobble millions of pounds of turkey in the next few weeks and 
government food experts are bracing for the annual flock of calls about the 
safety methods for cooking and storing holiday meals. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture operates a Meat and Poultry Hot Line to answer 
these queries, and for the holiday season weekend hours are being added to the 
toll-free service. 
</P>
<P>
The hot line is now in operation from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time, seven days 
a week, and will also be operating from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. 
The number is 1-800-535-4555. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking turkeys days ahead and freezing them for the holiday, cooking them and 
taking the bird to relatives, stuffing the fowl and other potential problems 
are among the most common topics discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service has compiled a list of the 
six top turkey questions it gets each year, and the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Question: How long will turkey last in the freezer? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A whole frozen turkey can be stored in a home freezer at 0 degrees for 
up to one year without appreciable loss of quality. To prevent freezer burn, 
wrap the turkey in heavy freezer paper. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Which tastes better, fresh or frozen turkey? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is no significant difference in quality between a fresh turkey and a 
frozen one. But you can only keep a fresh turkey refrigerated one to two days 
before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How should I thaw a turkey? 
</P>
<P>
A: Thawing a turkey in the refrigerator is the preferred method. Allow one day 
for each five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If in a hurry, thaw the turkey in a clean sink. Cover the bird with cold water, 
changing the water every 30 minutes to keep it cool. Allow six to nine hours 
for a 12- to 16-pound turkey, nine to 11 hours for a 16- to 20-pound bird. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey can also be thawed in the microwave oven, if it will fit. 
</P>
<P>
Be ready to cook the bird as soon as it is thawed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the safest way to stuff a turkey? 
</P>
<P>
A: Stuff the turkey just before you put it in the oven. To save time, chop up 
and refrigerate the stuffing ingredients the night before. Combine everything 
in the morning, just before roasting. Stuff the bird loosely. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the best way to cook a picture-perfect turkey? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several good cooking methods which will provide a delicious, 
tender turkey. 
</P>
<P>
You can roast the bird, uncovered, in a 325-degree oven. This will give drier 
meat but great roasted flavor. Or you can put the bird in an oven cooking bag, 
which will give moister meat in a shorter time. Microwaves, rotisseries and 
even an outdoor kettle grill can also be used. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I cook the turkey the day before Thanksgiving? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cooking ahead requires special attention to safe handling. First, cook the 
bird to an internal temperature of 180 degrees in an oven set no lower than 325 
degrees. Bake the stuffing separately. 
</P>
<P>
When it is fully roasted, let the bird stand for minutes. Then carve the meat 
off, leaving the legs, thighs and wings intact if you like. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerate the turkey meat in small, shallow containers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving Day, reheat the meat in a 325-degree oven or in the microwave. 
To keep the meat tender when using a conventional oven, cover it with gravy or 
reserved natural juices. 
</P>
<P>
Serve the heated slices on a platter with the drumsticks and wings garnishing 
the edges. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally people will suggest cooking a turkey all night in a low oven. 
Don't do this, the department warns. Dangerous bacteria can multiply in a 
turkey cooked at a temperature lower than 325 degrees, the department says. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly dangerous practice is partially cooking the turkey ahead of time 
and finishing it later, since it may not get hot enough to kill the bacteria 
either time, food safety experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
People who want to take a turkey with them on a Thanksgiving visit to friends 
or relatives should cook it ahead and freeze the meat, transport it in an 
insulated cooler and rewarm it there.

DEAR JEANNE: Please send me a revision of Spaghetti a la Carbonara, enclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- R. M., Anacortes, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
SPAGHETTI A LA CARBONARA 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound (8 slices) bacon, preferably pancetta, cut in small strips 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 (16-ounce) package spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Warm serving bowl in 200 degree oven. Cream butter in small bowl and set aside. 
Beat together eggs and egg yolks in another bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan 
cheese and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Fry bacon pieces over medium heat but do not allow to crisp. Reduce heat to low 
and pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat. Add olive oil and red pepper 
flakes and keep warm over low heat. 
</P>
<P>
Boil spaghetti in large kettle of boiling salted water. Do not overcook. While 
spaghetti is cooking, add whipping cream to pan with bacon. Bring cream to 
simmer. 
</P>
<P>
Drain cooked spaghetti well and place in preheated bowl. Working quickly, 
immediately toss spaghetti with creamed butter. Stir in hot bacon-cream 
mixture, then add egg-cheese mixture, tossing until well-blended. 
</P>
<P>
Divide between 8 heated bowls and top with remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 
cheese, 1 tablespoon per serving. Makes 8 (1-cup) servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR R. M.: Bacon, which is practically all fat, is normally very difficult to 
eliminate without missing its flavor. However, by using Canadian bacon and 
reducing the amount by half I have come up with a revision that should please 
your palate as well as your waistline. 
</P>
<P>
My recipe only makes six cups, but I think it can still serve eight people 
because it is so rich-tasting. 
</P>
<P>
LIGHT SPAGHETTI A LA CARBONARA 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound Canadian bacon, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 egg plus 2 egg whites, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup evaporated skim milk 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
12 ounces spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
Warm serving bowl in 200 degree oven. Cook bacon in non-stick skillet until 
lightly browned. Remove bacon from skillet and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat margarine and olive oil over very low heat in same skillet. Add red pepper 
flakes and, stirring continuously with wire whisk, add beaten egg mixture. 
</P>
<P>
As sauce begins to thicken, stir in milk and 1/3 cup cheese. Keep warm over 
very low heat, stirring frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Boil spaghetti in large kettle of boiling water for about 7 minutes. Do not 
overcook. Drain well and place into preheated bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Working quickly, toss spaghetti with sauce and bacon. Serve in heated bowls. 
Sprinkle each serving with 1 1/2 teaspoons Parmesan cheese. Makes 8 (3/4-cup) 
servings.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SUPPLEMENTS ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BALANCED NUTRITION OF 
A GOOD DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are you among the millions of Americans who start each day with a vitamin pill? 
If so, you may do it despite knowing that your diet probably provides all the 
nutrients essential for good health, and that even the best supplement is no 
substitute for a well-planned diet. 
</P>
<P>
The National Research Council recently released a wide-ranging report on many 
topics related to diet and health. The report confirmed the conclusion that 
vitamins are not necessary for many people. According to evidence, daily 
vitamin or mineral supplements are neither harmful nor beneficial to the 
population at large. 
</P>
<P>
This issue made headlines throughout the country, drowning out other aspects of 
the report such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and osteoporosis. Yet despite 
all the media coverage, our guess is that American behavior has changed very 
little. And for understandable reasons. A single vitamin and mineral supplement 
is, after all, a bit of low-cost nutritional insurance for any of us, and 
particularly useful at special times -- during infancy and early childhood, 
pregnancy, lactation, for the elderly whose caloric intake may be limited and 
for many people who are ill. 
</P>
<P>
While we have a good idea of who would benefit most from supplements, we know 
little about the relationship between use and need. But we are learning. As 
part of a national survey conducted in 1986, the National Center for Health 
Statistics, along with the Food and Drug Administration, collected data showing 
who is taking supplements and what they are taking. 
</P>
<P>
In each family interviewed over a six-month period, information about 
supplement use was obtained for one adult 18 or over and one child age two to 
six. (The findings don't include pregnant and nursing mothers, groups of 
particular interest.) 
</P>
<P>
During 1986, over one-third of all U.S. adults took vitamin and mineral 
supplements. Factors associated with usage included sex, race and age. Among 
adults, heaviest users were white women, ages 45 to 64. At the other extreme, 
black males 65 and older were least likely to use a vitamin and mineral 
product. Income was a great divider too. While only 28% of those with family 
incomes under $7,000 took supplements, approximately 45% of those whose incomes 
were over $40,000 reported using them. 
</P>
<P>
Young children were also big consumers, averaging 43% among three- to 
six-year-olds, with heavier use at the younger end. And there were differences 
by race. While 45% of white children took a supplement, among the black 
children the figure was only 30%. And here, income was an even bigger factor. 
Just 23% of children ages two to six in families earning less than $7,000 took 
supplements, compared to 50% of those whose incomes were at least $40,000. 
Higher education levels of adults were also associated with more widespread use 
by both adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
The survey collected information about types of supplements used. Regardless of 
how many supplements they took, roughly 40% of adults took multivitamins. For 
more than 90% of children, the supplement of choice was a multivitamin. 
</P>
<P>
Of the single vitamins taken, Vitamin C was identified most often, by about 31% 
of adults. Women were more likely than men to take mineral supplements, 
explained partly by the more frequent use of calcium by older women. Iron 
ranked second, and was the mineral consumed most often both by adult men and 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
Quantitatively, many Americans take much more than the Recommended Dietary 
Allowances (RDAs) in the supplements they consume. The average daily intake of 
Vitamin C for men was 250% of the RDA, while that for Vitamin B-12, was 300%. 
Among women, Vitamin E and B-12 intakes were highest, 250% of the RDA for each, 
followed by thiamine (225%) and riboflavin (217%). Ten percent of supplement 
users consumed an average of 15 times the RDA for no less than six vitamins, 
including E, C, thiamine, riboflavin, Vitamin B-6 and B-12. For 5% of these men 
and women, average intake of thiamine, riboflavin, B-6 and B-12 totaled over 30 
times the RDA. But why people take such huge amounts is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Use of individual minerals was not as extreme. In general, average intakes were 
less than 200% of the RDAs. And among young children, average intake for most 
individual nutrients was between 100 and 200% of recommended levels. 
</P>
<P>
These data illustrate on a broader scale what smaller studies have shown 
repeatedly: Many Americans take vitamin and mineral supplements that go well 
beyond the one-a-day "nutritional insurance" plan. How do supplements 
complement the diets of those who use them? What possible hazardous effects 
might befall people who continue to take massive amounts of single supplements? 
</P>
<P>
The fact that such important questions remain unanswered should convince any 
sensible person that taking supplements far in excess of recommended amounts is 
taking a risk without benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Choose Breakfast Cereals Solely for the Vitamin Content 
</P>
<P>
Question: A TV commercial I saw for a breakfast cereal showed that you'd have 
to eat boxes and boxes of other cereals to get all the vitamins you receive 
from one box of their brand. Should I choose my cereal on the basis of vitamin 
content? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. The product you describe sounds like what we call "a vitamin pill 
in a cereal bowl." That is, it contains 100% of the U.S. Recommended Dietary 
Allowances for various vitamins and minerals. If you prefer the taste, fine. 
But there's little reason to choose it on nutritional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the science of nutrition has expanded, we are far from creating 
perfect nutrition in a pill (or in a cereal bowl, for that matter). There is 
more to being well-nourished than simply meeting the day's need for vitamins 
and minerals. For that we must depend on a varied diet stocked with fresh and 
lightly processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What causes severe food allergies? 
</P>
<P>
A: Severe or mild, the mechanism for the development of allergies is the same. 
It's also the same whether the offending substance comes from food or from 
drugs, insect venom or poison. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, it is an abnormal response to an antigen, usually a protein. In 
susceptible individuals, initial exposure induces production of an antibody 
called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. These antibodies then attach themselves 
to certain types of cells in the body, setting the stage for the next encounter 
with the offending antigen. When the substance containing this antigen is 
consumed, it links onto the IgE antibodies attached to particular types of 
cells, causing them to release large amounts of histamine and other substances. 
</P>
<P>
These substances, in turn, make blood vessels expand and leak fluids into 
surrounding tissues, prompting smooth muscles in the airways to contract. 
Resulting symptoms vary in type and severity. In the extreme, life-threatening 
anaphylactic reactions usually begin with a sensation of warmth, followed by 
severe itching, often on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The 
skin becomes flushed, hives may appear, the face may swell and breathing 
becomes difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read about a new type of vacuum-packaged prepared foods requiring 
refrigeration. The article said that while these may taste better than 
conventionally processed foods, they are potentially more of a health hazard. 
The quality sounds superior. But how great is the risk? 
</P>
<P>
A: Doubtless you are referring to what the French call sous-vide (literally 
translated as "under vacuum") foods, a method widely used in Europe that is 
gathering momentum here. 
</P>
<P>
The process, used for a growing number of mixed dishes, involves placing fresh 
ingredients in plastic pouches and vacuuming out air. Some manufacturers also 
add either nitrogen or carbon dioxide to modify the atmosphere in the pouch. 
The sealed container is then cooked under very precise conditions and 
refrigerated. To prepare the food, you simply place it in a pot of boiling 
water to reheat. 
</P>
<P>
Since the food is subjected to neither the high heat of canning nor the very 
low temperatures needed for freezing, damage to cell structures is minimized, 
resulting in fresher flavor. However, the oxygen-free or nearly oxygen-free 
environment provides an excellent arena for the growth of several bacteria that 
can cause such serious forms of food poisoning as botulism, listeriosis and 
Yersinia poisoning. The problem is that the temperatures used to process the 
food are high enough to kill harmless organisms that produce unpleasant odors 
signaling food spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Every time I read a nutrition article that advises eating more "complex 
carbohydrates," I wind up feeling frustrated, because I'm not sure what it 
really means. Can you fill me in? 
</P>
<P>
A: Common sources of complex carbohydrates in our diets are wheat, corn, 
barley, rice, oats and potatoes. In the wheat kernel, the complex carbohydrates 
include both digestible starch and indigestible fiber. 
</P>
<P>
A more descriptive name for complex carbohydrates is polysaccharides, a term 
that translates directly to "many sugars." And that is exactly what complex 
carbohydrates are: many molecules of simple sugars linked together, sometimes 
with an acid built into the structure. The structure of pectin, for instance, 
includes two simple sugars, glucose and arabinose, and galacturonic acid as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The way sugar molecules (and acids) are strung together determines the type of 
carbohydrate formed, and thus its physical and chemical properties. Amylose, 
the starch in such foods as wheat and corn, is made up of molecules of glucose 
attached in straight chains. The human digestive system has enzymes that can 
separate the glucose units so that they can be absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
To experience this for yourself, chew a plain cracker longer than usual. The 
sweetness that begins to develop is the result of enzymes breaking the starch 
molecules down to their simple components. But if these same units are linked 
in a more complicated way, as they are in cellulose, the body cannot pull them 
apart. They are part of the fiber that travels through the body undigested. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm an avid reader of ingredients lists and never cease to be amazed at what 
I find. For instance, recently I noticed that frankfurters and luncheon meats 
contain corn syrup. Then I became curious about just how much sweetener they 
contain, but there was no way to tell from the ingredients list. I wonder if 
you could provide the information. 
</P>
<P>
A: They don't contain much. Frankfurters, bologna and similar products can 
contain a maximum of 2% corn syrup by weight. That translates to just over half 
a gram per ounce. To put that into more visual terms, a one-ounce slice of 
bologna would contain about 1/8 teaspoon of corn syrup.

RISING VANDALISM OF U.S. MAILBOXES UNDER INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rash of mailbox vandalism in La Canada Flintridge has prompted U.S. postal 
inspection officials to step up investigation of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, 40 incidents of mailbox vandalism have been reported to 
the U.S. Postal Service, according to La Canada Flintridge Postmaster Penny 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"But that number is even higher," Stevenson said. "Many of these crimes go 
unreported." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service spokesman John Conte said, "The area has recently been 
plaqued with the destruction of mailboxes with clubs or baseball bats or 
similar instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch termed this type of vandalism "mailbox 
baseball. Kids ride around in a pickup truck or convertibles and strike the 
mailboxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement division of the U.S. 
Postal Service, has been called in to step up the investigation. This includes 
notifying high school teachers and parents of the problem and punishment 
involved. In addition, postal inspectors "home in on a few suspects," Obritsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have some leads and other information that we hope will result in 
some arrests soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch said officials are concerned about the recent increase in mailbox 
destruction because the trend has not declined as expected following the usual 
rash of neighborhood vandalism during Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Destruction of mailboxes is considered a federal offense and carries a penalty 
of up to $10,000 or 10 years in jail or both.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: EDDIE WAS A WALKER YOU HAD TO NOTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you get around much in La Canada Flintridge, you must have come to know of 
Edson Johnson, at least obliquely. 
</P>
<P>
He was the walker. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie was a walker you had to notice. He looked quaint heading down the street, 
even from a distance. His clothes were out of style and uncoordinated. His 
pants sagged. Sometimes his clothes looked as if they needed a wash. He hunched 
slightly over a walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
Most remarkable was the gait itself. He stepped smartly, with a keen sense of 
destination, even though, if you saw him often enough, you could guess that he 
was caught in a loop. He simply took great pleasure in walking. His stride made 
him look younger than his age, the mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie sent letters to The Times publicizing the Rainbow Walkers, a group he had 
created. It left every Sunday from the gates of Descanso Garden, bound at a 
leisurely pace for destinations with romantic names such as Winery Canyon and 
Fair Haven, the estate of actor Victor McGlaughlin. Eddie charged a fee of $1. 
</P>
<P>
The form of the letters was more interesting than their content. They were 
crudely typed in script with broken spacing, errors corrected in ballpoint pen. 
Several weeks of announcements came together on a single sheet or sometimes on 
the back of a used envelope, the words tapering to the tip of the flap. 
</P>
<P>
This was strange enough to call for investigation. It was a little more than a 
year ago that I conducted the inquiry, in person. Besides myself, 10 people 
assembled that day for the hike, one man and seven women who were regulars, a 
young couple who were new. 
</P>
<P>
The women came in expensive cars and wore chic outfits. They chatted for a few 
minutes, bringing one another up on news of mutual friends. Eddie walked down 
from a handsome house on Fairlawn Drive, in which he had lived with his elderly 
mother for many years. He made small talk about the theories of 
electro-physicist Nikola Tesla, inventor of the alternating current motor. 
</P>
<P>
Then he began the walk, which covered several miles, all on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie played both guide and savant. He gave pointers on exercise theory and La 
Canada history. He recited the names and medicinal properties of the flowers 
that grew on the hillsides as well as the weeds that poked from the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie said he formed the group because he was tired of Sierra Club hikes. 
</P>
<P>
"All they do is hike," he said. "I like to talk." 
</P>
<P>
The new couple vanished before the hike was half over. The others straggled in 
small groups. But all managed to take in some of Eddie's banter. 
</P>
<P>
One of them said the women belonged to the Rainbow Walkers because they needed 
the exercise and because they found Eddie to be a fun companion. Obviously, 
they also found him non-threatening. Eddie's gushing laugh was as free of 
psychological pressure as it was absent of social acumen. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Eddie had passed the test. His announcements continued to find a place 
in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, signs of trouble in Eddie's life began to appear. 
</P>
<P>
He raised his fee to $1.75. About the same time, his announcements grew even 
stranger. They came taped to the inside of preprinted mailers for the 
Children's Museum in downtown Los Angeles. It appeared that Eddie had found a 
way to post his messages without buying stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Resolving not to honor the illicit use of the mail, I threw out a few of the 
releases. But soon I gave in. Lives held together with such flimsy string as 
Eddie's are not made for heavy handling. 
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise, then, when the news arrived last week that Eddie's life had 
come undone the previous Sunday. His 84-year-old invalid mother fell and called 
her son-in-law in Monrovia, who called 911. When paramedics arrived, Eddie 
became frightened and wouldn't let them in. Sheriff's deputies were called. The 
son-in-law arrived to let them in. They found a terrible mess of trash, empty 
cat food cans and cat droppings. 
</P>
<P>
Before the day was over, the county Fire, Health and Animal Control Departments 
had all dispatched agents to the house. 
</P>
<P>
"The odor in the house was just so bad that while they were working there, the 
Fire Department lent our workers oxygen tanks," said Dan Sturkie, manager of 
the county's Baldwin Hills animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The cats appeared to have come from all around the neighborhood for handouts, 
entering through a broken window, Sturkie said. About 20 had been trapped. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, Eddie's mother was sent to a hospital for treatment. She was 
later released to the care of the son-in-law. Social workers found Eddie 
another place to live. Health officials declared the house a hazard and ordered 
it cleaned. An official said the son-in-law planned to take responsibility for 
the cleanup, then sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
And so the Rainbow Walkers have lost their guide and savant.

COUNCIL SCRAPS PARK PLANS AFTER NEIGHBORS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council voted Tuesday against constructing a public park in 
an affluent neighborhood at the northern edge of Rimcrest Drive, after 72% of 
the nearby residents signaled their opposition in a city survey. 
</P>
<P>
The property, which offers a breathtaking view of the city, was deeded to the 
city by the construction company that developed the Rimcrest Drive subdivision 
on the condition that a park be developed there. 
</P>
<P>
Since, even though the land is not an official park, area residents have 
repeatedly complained about wild parties, indiscreet sex, night prowlers and 
vandals on the property. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the results of the survey, the council agreed to auction off the 
property for development of homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents, I think foolishly, decided against having a park, so we have to 
go with that," said Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg.

TIMBER SALE REVENUES TO HELP U.S. FOREST SERVICE RESTORE 2 OF 3 DETERIORATING 
LOOKOUT CABINS IN ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The roof is rotted, the smashed windows have been boarded up and the railings 
of its creaky walkway are badly rusted. Scrub oak, buckthorn and pine grow amid 
a jumble of boulders, and red-tailed hawks soar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
In its present condition, it is hard to imagine that the lookout cabin once 
played an important part in safeguarding Angeles National Forest against fires. 
</P>
<P>
But it is precisely that importance that has earned a new lease on life for the 
weather-worn cabin perched on a craggy outcrop of Mt. Vetter, nearly 6,000 feet 
above a fork of Big Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The 13- by 13-foot "ground cab," as U. S. Forest Service archeologist Mike 
McIntyre calls it, was the last in a line of 22 lookouts that have come and 
gone since the first one was built in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
It was retired as a fire lookout a decade ago and since then has fallen on hard 
times. But thanks to surplus timber sales by national forests in Northern 
California last year, the Forest Service has acquired funds to launch a $16,000 
project that will give two of three surviving lookouts a face lift and preserve 
them as historic displays. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of the Forest Service, you think of Smokey the Bear and the 
ranger in the lookout watching for fires," said McIntyre, who spearheaded the 
restoration drive. "We want to turn this into an interpretive exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
Aiding in the restoration effort will be the Big Santa Anita Historical Society 
in Arcadia. It pledged $5,000 toward refurnishing the bare lookout cabins at 
Vetter, 10 miles north of Arcadia, and at South Mt. Hawkins, 12 miles east of 
Vetter. A third cabin, built in the 1960s, did not fare so well and will not be 
restored: It rests unused on a steel tower at Mt. Slide, overlooking Pyramid 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service personnel and volunteers will begin patching up the cabins in 
coming months. It costs too much to bring a carpenter in to do the job, 
McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Owens, president of the historical society, said many of the old forest 
lodges and mountain taverns have been destroyed or allowed to decay. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a whole lot of history left in the forest structurally," Owens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both lookouts under restoration are eligible for inclusion in the federal 
National Register of Historic Places. That means that every rotted plank 
removed must be replaced with the same type of wood. 
</P>
<P>
"It adds to the cost, but it's well worth it," said McIntyre, who is applying 
to have the cabins formally designated as historic. 
</P>
<P>
After the restoration is finished, McIntyre said he hopes to get volunteer 
groups to adopt the cabins to help with their maintenance, suggesting as 
possible helpers Boy Scout troops, firefighters organizations or environmental 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual goal is for volunteers to live in trailers at the cabin site, 
acting as security guards and providing visitors with historical information. 
</P>
<P>
The lookouts are part of the lore of firefighting's past in Angeles National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Before the advent of the cabins, park rangers would simply nail pieces of wood 
to a tree and climb up for a good perch, McIntyre said. Others would camp at a 
high point armed with a fire-finder, which resembles a large compass overlaying 
a map. 
</P>
<P>
When lookout cabins came into use, the person on watch would remain at the 
station for six or seven months during the fire season each year. In the early 
1950s, the Forest Service had more than 5,000 manned fire lookouts nationwide. 
Today, fewer than 600 remain; fewer than 100 are in California. 
</P>
<P>
In Angeles Forest, propane stoves were used for cooking, and water had to be 
hauled up in five-gallon cans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very solitary life," McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy De Lapp, a Forest Service accountant, lived alone atop a 30-foot-high 
wooden tower in the South Mt. Hawkins lookout cab from 1952 until it was closed 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks it's so romantic. But it's just a job," said De Lapp, 
conceding that she did enjoy the peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Between fires, she read "everything you could get your hands on," from Tolstoy 
to the history of World War II, she said. She put out a pan of water for the 
birds and deer and fed a skunk that almost became a pet. And she always 
remained watchful for the warning puffs of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"You automatically just looked all the time," said De Lapp, who has watched 
more fires start than she cares to count. 
</P>
<P>
She learned to stay alert for the lightning bolt that lingered for more than a 
second on a branch of a tree, "especially if it had a red tip." 
</P>
<P>
"Lookouts were critical at a time when there weren't many people in the 
forest," McIntyre said. At one time they reported about 70% of the fires that 
started, but their importance faded as more people started using the forest 
recreationally. 
</P>
<P>
More roads penetrated the terrain, and rangers began to regularly patrol 
campgrounds. Twenty-four fire stations now serve the forest's 693,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
And because the forest is under the flight path to Ontario International 
Airport, even airline pilots began to call in reports of fires, said Gordon 
Rowley, Forest Service fire management specialist. 
</P>
<P>
If a blaze is sighted, "the airline will call the tower, and the tower will 
call us," said Rowley, adding that by the time the lookouts were abandoned, 
they were reporting only 3% of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they are now obsolete, Owens said, "we have to understand what 
people used to do to appreciate what we have today."

Angry farmers and radical students demanding an end to U.S. food imports 
protested in about two dozen cities and rural areas, hurling rocks and 
firebombs at police. In Kunsan, protesters took their demands to the main gate 
of a U.S. Air Force base. About 2,000 demonstrators battled riot police at 
Konkuk University in eastern Seoul after they were prevented from protesting in 
the streets. "Drive out the Yankees," they chanted, charging that cheap U.S. 
imports threaten their livelihood.

Communist Party officials in Prague said they have been warned by the Soviet 
Union against further delay in introducing political change in Czechoslovakia, 
the New York Times reported. The first major public signs of fear, tension and 
conflict within the Prague government are begining to appear as a possible 
consequence of the high-level message, the newspaper said. Moscow is reported 
to have cautioned Prague not to make the same mistakes as those made by party 
hard-liners elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the paper said.

this week. It gave no figure for the number of those executions but said many 
of the more than 900 officially announced during the first five months of this 
year, mainly for drug offenses, were also alleged to have been politically 
motivated.

A lump-sum payment of as much as $8,900 will be sent before Christmas to 9,300 
Vietnam War veterans disabled by Agent Orange, according to an order signed in 
New York by a federal judge. The payments, totaling about $30 million, won't 
significantly change the total award an eligible veteran will receive but 
provide a large share of the compensation in a single payment, court officials 
said. In 1984, seven chemical companies -- without admitting guilt -- agreed to 
pay $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam veterans 
and their families.

The House approved a plan to extend the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for six 
months while lawmakers search for a way to end internal bickering that has 
plagued the panel in recent years. The stopgap measure designed to keep the 
commission from automatically going out of business at the end of the month won 
approval 278 to 135 without debate and now goes to the Senate. "They (the 
commission) have frankly made themselves into a national laughingstock," Rep. 
F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) said.

Police in Denver began registering residents' semiautomatic assault weapons 
under a new city ordinance, while opponents threatened to file a lawsuit 
challenging its constitutionality. Only one gun owner, the city's former chief 
district attorney, showed up during the first hour. The ordinance was 
introduced in the wake of growing gang activity in the city. Some semiautomatic 
owners were said to oppose registration because of fears that the City Council 
will eventually ban their weapons. Failure to register a weapon with a magazine 
of more than 20 rounds can bring fines of $100 to $999 and jail terms of 10 
days to six months.

A 63-year-old Mojave man who pleaded no contest to 50 felony counts of child 
molestation and a pornography charge was sentenced in Bakersfield to 30 years 
in prison. Kern County Superior Court Judge Clarence Westra Jr. said he 
accepted a plea bargain involving Robert Lee Crosswhite with the knowledge that 
because of Crosswhite's age and health problems, he is unlikely to go free 
again. Crosswhite was accused of molesting six children, ages 8 to 13.

R.F. ORTON: PROPRIETOR OF CANOGA PARK'S FEED MILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Ray Orton's fondest childhood memories is of hunting deer with a Spanish 
cowboy named Pancho Real in canyons north of what is now the town of Agoura 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Pancho used to ride a horse every Saturday into town from clear out there to 
get his supplies, and I got acquainted with him because I loved to speak 
Spanish," Orton said. 
</P>
<P>
Real, who minded the northern fences of the Agoura family's ranch, taught the 
young Orton a love of hunting and fine guns that he still retains. 
</P>
<P>
Today his collection of guns remains well-oiled, and he still takes his limit 
now and then, as he did at a dove hunt in September in Temecula. "It's my 
greatest hobby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orton's father founded the first feed store in Canoga Park, which was then 
called Owensmouth. 
</P>
<P>
As a young boy, Orton first picked up a few words of Spanish working side by 
side with Mexicans in his father's bean dryer before World War I. He practiced 
by speaking with descendants of the area's early Spanish settlers, who began 
moving to the slowly growing community from homesteads in Las Virgenes Canyon 
and the Malibu Creek area. "We all got along better in those days than they did 
in later years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Owensmouth High School he took 4 years of Spanish with a demanding teacher 
named Lula Draper. At his 1923 commencement, Orton sang two early California 
Spanish songs -- "La Paloma," the song of the dove, and "La Golondrina," the 
song of the swallow. 
</P>
<P>
He later sang at Spanish fiestas and pageants at the missions at Santa Barbara 
and at San Fernando, raising money for the restoration of the latter in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Orton prospered in the family business and served as president of the Canoga 
Park Chamber of Commerce for two years in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
He sold "Orton's Growing Mash" ("It Makes Them Grow!") to the 1-acre chicken 
farms that sprang up in the West Valley around World War I and milled barley 
and other crops for the large ranches that remained intact well into the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
But he could see that the future would consume such large landholdings, that 
the need for animal feed would plummet, as houses replaced pastures. He sold 
Orton Milling Co. in 1945, closing escrow the day after the end of World War 
II, and a few years later moved with his wife and three children to the western 
San Bernardino County town of Upland, where he lives now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was pretty good timing," Orton said. "I think I got out at the 
right time."

PROFILES: FIVE LONGTIME RESIDENTS REMEMBER WHEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The memories of the San Fernando Valley's oldest longtime residents are set on 
astage swept clean by progress, and only the smallest props -- insignificant 
details, really -- remain, often unrecognized for what they are. 
</P>
<P>
Examples? Catherine Mulholland, the granddaughter of the aqueduct builder, 
knows that the clump of 75-year-old grapefruit trees on the northwest corner of 
Corbin Avenue and Nordhoff Street in Northridge is the last remnant of the 
working area of her father's 640-acre ranch. But the employees of the 
neighboring K mart, who pick those sweet grapefruit, know nothing of their 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
Olive Witmer Reynolds, whose father arrived in Van Nuys with his family in 1914 
to found the Missionary Church and went on to own a lumber mill and a hotel, 
recently watched her childhood home near Vesper Avenue and Vanowen Street 
bulldozed to make room for an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
And she wonders: Did anyone save the exquisite paneling and cabinets -- 
handmade from South American mahogany and other precious woods -- in the 
elegant formal dining room? The indoor working fountain? 
</P>
<P>
One wing of the Lankershim ranch home, built by the family whose patriarch, 
Isaac, bought much of the south half of the Valley in 1869 from California's 
last Mexican governor, remains. But it is not in its original location near the 
intersection of Lankershim and Ventura boulevards. It is now the Chapel in the 
Canyon at 9012 Topanga Canyon Blvd. in Canoga Park. The rest of the house was 
moved as well, but James Dodson of the Valley College Historical Museum said no 
one knows where. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some landmarks still stand. A handful of adobes, such as those 
built by the de la Osa family in 1849 in what is now Encino, or by the Lopez 
family in 1882 in San Fernando, are open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But for those arriving in the Valley today, there is precious little to tell 
them that this huge chunk of urban sprawl was dusty, rural, open, relatively 
remote and even wild in some areas as recently as 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley's history seems more evanescent than that of other places, perhaps, 
because its development came relatively late, with dramatic suddenness. 
</P>
<P>
It was but 76 years ago that water arrived in the Valley, via a 233-mile 
aqueduct from the Owens River in the Sierra. And the coming of that water 
presaged the dramatic growth of all of Los Angeles and spurred the founding of 
Van Nuys in 1911, Canoga Park in 1912 and other developments. 
</P>
<P>
Growth continued, but in the 1940s, the Valley's population was only 150,000, 
and 70% of the land was being cultivated, one history says. Since the end of 
World War II, however, the population has exploded tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
Such growth has strained the fabric of the Valley's collective memory. Many 
founding families have moved on and taken their histories with them. And so the 
memories of those who remain must be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
People such as Whitley V.N. Huffaker, left; Ray F. Orton, right; Floriza 
Husbands, above; Margaret Richter, part of a pioneering real estate clan; and 
Sam Greenberg, whose family was the first of Jewish descent to live in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Olive Reynolds said the enormous change has seemed gradual. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, she said: "There is nothing at all the same. The significant thing is that 
it is a totally 100% different flavor and environment, a different feel. There 
is nothing that seems to remain of the old flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Except memory.

WHITLEY VAN NUYS HUFFAKER: VAN NUYS' FIRSTBORN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whitley Van Nuys Huffaker took his first breath in 1911, the year Van Nuys 
incorporated, above a bank in Dr. Charles Canby's medical office and down the 
street from the booming real estate business of the town's founders -- H.J. 
Whitley, W.P. Whitsett and I.N. Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
In a burst of civic pride, George and Dora Huffaker named their nearsighted 
seventh child after two of the founders, inexplicably ignoring Whitsett, whose 
aggressive and innovative salesmanship is remembered today. 
</P>
<P>
Huffaker's destiny, as well as life in the San Fernando Valley, was to be 
shaped by the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
His father drove the town's first automobile and opened the Valley's first 
dealership on the present site of the Van Nuys Federal Building. His 
father-in-law paved many of the streets. Huffaker himself sold auto parts in 
North Hollywood for more than 50 years. And any remnant of rural character was 
doomed when the concrete ribbon of the Ventura Freeway unfurled in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
But Huffaker spent much of his early life on horseback, ranging over and among 
grassy meadows, apricot orchards, walnut trees, chicken ranches and fields of 
lima beans, asparagus, tomatoes and melons. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles River was still untamed, and there were crawdads to be caught, 
swimming holes to splash in. The air was crystal clear, making the mountains 
seem within range of a boy with a strong arm and the proper river stone. And, 
instead of auto exhaust, the valley was filled with the astringent smells of 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"We had freedom," Huffaker said wistfully. "You could go almost anywhere you 
wanted to on horseback, or just on a hike." 
</P>
<P>
Now the vast open spaces of his childhood have been reduced to the Van 
Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park and the chip-and-putt golf course at the apartment 
complex where Huffaker and his wife, Zella, have lived for 20 years. "At first 
it was so gradual that we didn't pay that much attention to it, a little plot 
here and a little plot there. You didn't realize you were getting engulfed by 
houses and apartments." 
</P>
<P>
The Huffakers' apartment is in a section called Cocoa Palms, in keeping with 
the tropical theme of the complex, and caged exotic birds sing amid the sounds 
of water rushing from painted concrete reproductions of famous waterfalls. But 
a view of something green and growing is as important to him as ever, and he's 
grateful for what he's got. 
</P>
<P>
When the owner built the place, Huffaker said, "he left open areas -- the golf 
course; we've got four swimming pools on the property here and whatnot," he 
said. "They build these new complexes . . . and you're looking at walls all the 
time. There's darn little shrubbery, a few flowers. It's just almost sickening, 
because it's not like this place."

FLORIZA DOHS HUSBANDS: SAN FERNANDO RESIDENT SINCE 1900. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Descendants of the Valley's first American owners and developers are relative 
newcomers in contrast to the long history of Floriza Husbands' family in 
California. Even Gold Rush immigrants cannot lay claim to such a long history. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands' grandmother, Isabel Rodriquez, was born in Monterey in 1831, and her 
grandfather came from Spain in the 1840s. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands, who was born in San Fernando in 1900 and has lived her entire life 
there, still has the royal blue satin ballroom gown her grandmother danced in 
at California's first inaugural ball, in 1849. The gown, in remarkably good 
condition, is on display at the Lopez Adobe in downtown San Fernando, where 
Husbands is a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Her grandfather, Antonio Villegas, was a vaquero on the 16,000-acre Porter Land 
and Water Co. ranch that surrounded the San Fernando Mission, using some of its 
now-dilapidated buildings as barns. 
</P>
<P>
That ranch undertook the first irrigation of the Valley in the late 1880s and 
planted a one-by-three-mile orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands lives in the house her grandparents built in San Fernando soon after 
they arrived there from Northern California in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
But she talks little of such history, out of modesty or mistrust of her memory. 
Nevertheless, she remembers festive dances and picnics at the Lopez Adobe, with 
members of such prominent families as the Lopezes, Maclays, Picos and Rinaldis 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
She also remembers that her mother, widowed young, raised four children with 
little money on five acres on North Maclay Street near Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Adella, grew vegetables, grapes, apricots, blackberries and quince, 
tended chickens and milked cows. She made cheese and canned the vegetables and 
fruit for year-round use. 
</P>
<P>
She did it all, insisting that her children attend school, where they learned 
to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands grew up speaking both languages. "My grandmother would talk to us in 
Spanish, and we'd answer her in English, which angered her greatly," said 
Husbands. 
</P>
<P>
"She said to us, 'When I speak Spanish to you, you speak Spanish, and if I'm 
going to speak English, you speak English.' "

POMONA PICKS ADMINISTRATOR; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: DIVIDED CITY COUNCIL IS UNANIMOUS IN HIRING AZUSA CITY 
ADMINISTRATOR JULIO FUENTES.

<P>
Julio Fuentes, city administrator in Azusa for the last 2 1/2 years, was 
appointed city administrator Tuesday night by unanimous vote of an often 
divided City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting City Adminstrator Tom Fee named Kelson McDaniel, 52, former 
police chief in San Clemente and Los Alamitos, as interim police chief. 
McDaniel, who began in Pomona Wednesday, has more than 25 years experience in 
law enforcement and said he will be a candidate for the permanent police chief 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Fee also announced Douglas Dunlap, former El Monte city administrator, will 
become deputy executive director of the city's redevelopment agency Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith said: "I'm thrilled. Mr. Fuentes is well qualified for the 
position. After six months of being adrift like a lost ship, we have a 
captain." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C.L. (Clay) Bryant said Fuentes was his second choice in a field of 
more than 130 applicants for the job, but he voted for him to make the decision 
unanimous. Councilman Tomas Ursua was more enthusiastic, saying "what we're 
getting is a young, energetic, bright image for Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, 33, is a graduate of Cal State Long Beach and holds a master's degree 
in public administration from USC. He held administrative positions in Monrovia 
and Cypress before joining Azusa in 1984 as an assistant to the city 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The administrator said he is looking forward to the challenge of working in 
Pomona, a city whose population of 119,000 is more than three times as large as 
that of Azusa. Fuentes is expected to start working for Pomona around the first 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He said his impression of the Pomona City Council is that "they are very 
talented, very bright people. They have a lot of excellent ideas." He said his 
first task will be to meet with council members about the direction the city 
should take. "I want their input," he said. "I've always prided myself on my 
excellent relations with council members." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said it was Fuentes' ability to move Azusa forward economically, despite 
a council often at odds politically, that made him attractive to Pomona. "He 
has had experience working with a difficult council," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua added that Fuentes has a reputation for fairness. "He won't get involved 
in political games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another asset, Ursua said, is that Fuentes is Latino in a city with a large 
minority population. "It really sends a message -- here's another role model," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said details of the salary and benefit package for Fuentes are still 
being worked out, but he has been offered a base salary of $87,200 a year, plus 
a $4,800 car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said his contract with Azusa requires him to give 45 days notice before 
leaving, but he is asking the council to release him in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The position of city administrator has been vacant since May 1, when the 
council fired former Administrator A.J. Wilson. An interim replacement, Andrew 
Lazzaretto, quit after a month. Fee, who has been acting city administrator 
since June, did not apply for the permanent appointment.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: IRWINDALE; 
</P>
<P>
GENERAL PLAN AMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irwindale General Plan has been amended to allow for construction of a 
stadium, a minor step toward landing the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously last week to permit stadium uses in one of 
two locations: a gravel pit north of the Foothill (210) Freeway or another 
gravel pit west of the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, city officials virtually abandoned the first site after they 
failed to gain control of land there for a stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans to acquire and develop the second site, owned by United 
Ready-Mix, a Los Angeles-based company, have become entangled in legal setbacks 
and internal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, one of Irwindale's chief consultants on the Raiders deal, 
Xavier Hermosillo, terminated his contract with the city for the second time, 
citing philosophical differences with other negotiators. Shortly afterward, he 
agreed to work on the deal free of charge, saying he had invested too much time 
to leave in the middle of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Incentive packages offered by Sacramento and Oakland and problems with 
Irwindale's offer have made the choice of Irwindale increasingly less likely in 
recent weeks as the site of a Raiders relocation. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on construction on the 600 acres owned by United Ready-Mix has been in 
effect since late September and was extended last week for 180 days to give the 
city more time to secure financial backing for a stadium project.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF TOURNEY RAISES $35,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A charity golf tournament in West Covina last week raised about $35,000 for the 
Life-Savers Foundation, a group that helps save the lives of sufferers of 
leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and aplastic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
The money will go to a drive to recruit bone-marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the event were leukemia patients Anissa Ayala, 17, of 
Walnut, and Danielle Nuccio, 8, of Glendora, both of whom are waiting for 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, Life-Savers estimates that 9,000 people are waiting for donors 
whose tissue type matches their own. The odds of one person being a suitable 
donor for another are one in 15,000, according to Susan Rafkin, spokeswoman for 
Life-Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Rafkin said that 25 people die every day because they lack suitable donors and 
that 10 to 15 people in Los Angeles County are in need of a marrow transplant 
at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
The golf tournament, the first of its kind, attracted 144 players. More than 
200 people attended a banquet that followed.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
COLORADO ST. BRIDGE TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's landmark Colorado Street Bridge will be closed to traffic 
immediately while the city undertakes a structural analysis of the bridge to 
determine if it would be safe during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The closure was approved Tuesday by the Pasadena Board of Directors, who also 
approved structural analysis for five other city-owned bridges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Colorado Street Bridge, the following bridges will be 
checked: the San Rafael, the La Loma, the Holly Street and the Oak Grove Drive 
bridges over the Arroyo Seco, and the Oak Grove Drive Bridge over Flint Canyon 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Three consulting firms will be paid $175,000 to determine how the structures 
would fare in a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The city decided to check its bridges after engineers advised city officials 
that the Colorado Street Bridge might collapse if Pasadena experienced an 
earthquake of the same magnitude that struck Northern California on Oct. 17.

SCHOOL NEWS: STUDENTS SEE GOVERNMENT AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 250 students attended the Claremont City Council meeting Tuesday. Why 
the large turnout? It was part of Youth and Government Day for Claremont and 
San Antonio high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors from government and economics classes were required to attend the 
two-hour meeting. Some sat in cliques. Some talked with friends. Others asked 
the council questions about the conditions of city roads and youth activities. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Diann Ring said she wanted students to attend the meeting because 
they should become more aware of local government. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids are going to be voters," she said. "This is where you can 
really make a difference. The youth brought it to our attention that the most 
under-served group in the city are the youth." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting started at 1 p.m., during the fifth period. Many students left to 
attend their last class before the meeting was over. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few who stayed to the end was Aytek Celik, 16, who had never 
attended a City Council meeting. She said she stayed because she was interested 
to see what happens at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see how they deal with the formal procedures," she said. "It gives 
the students insight to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Celik, who said she may go into politics as a career, said she was more 
interested in international politics. 
</P>
<P>
But, "you have to start somewhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second year high school students attended the meeting. Council 
members hope to make it an annual event. LUZ VILLARREAL

FREE GLASSES AND EYE SURGERY OFFERED TO UNINSURED WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUZ VILLARREAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the California Optometric Assn. are urging the uninsured working 
poor to take advantage of a statewide program this month that offers them free 
eye examinations, glasses and surgical care. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for the California Vision Project are being accepted through the 
end of November, and eye exams will continue through December, said Robert 
Gordon, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 optometrists, in cooperation with the Salvation Army, are 
participating in the project, donating their time to examine patients who are 
working but not insured, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the project is to examine 10,000 to 15,000 uninsured working poor 
and their families and to provide them with eye exams and glasses, if needed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report published in 1986, there were 2.5 million uninsured 
working poor people in California, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we wanted to put on a charitable program," he said. "People who are 
unemployed get medical care from welfare. People over 65 get medical care also. 
Somebody needed to show the Legislature that there was a need to help the 
uninsured working poor." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon predicted that the eye examinations will also detect a number of 
diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, that affect the entire 
body. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is successful, the optometrists plan to repeat it every year, 
said Dr. Lynn Caffrey Gabriel, president-elect of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to give something to (the poor)," she said. "So many of them 
just make enough money to provide for food and rent but can't afford medical 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the California Vision Project began in September, 1988, Gordon 
said. The California Lions Clubs of Lions International will absorb the cost of 
treating patients who require more than basic eye examinations. The Optical 
Manufacturers Assn. and the Optical Laboratory Assn. will donate frames and 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents who need eye care can apply at Salvation Army 
offices in Pasadena, (818) 795-8639; Covina, (818) 331-4871, and Pomona, (714) 
623-1579. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army will forward the applications to the Optometric Assn., which 
will assign patients to the nearest available doctor.

2 SIDES AT RIO HONDO COLLEGE TRY AGAIN FOR PACT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: AFTER 6 MONTHS, ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE STILL $1 MILLION APART. 
THEY MEET AGAIN FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Caught in a tug of war over money, the administrators at Rio Hondo College and 
members of the faculty association will meet Friday at the negotiating table, 
trying once again to resolve their differences in a lengthy teachers' contract 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides said they are not expecting a speedy solution to the 
six-month-long disagreement that centers mostly on salary increases for the 
faculty. The teachers, whose contract expired on June 30, are requesting an 
immediate 12% raise and an additional 18% over the next two years. College 
administrators are offering an immediate 6.5% raise and a 12% increase for 
1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with disagreements over employee benefits and salary increases for 
part-time faculty, the two sides are about $1 million apart. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is not reached by Friday, the two sides will try again next 
week. After that they have the option of requesting a fact-finding report by an 
outside consultant on which solution is the best. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Newcomer, president of the Rio Hondo College Faculty Assn., said he is 
hopeful the two sides can reach an agreement without a strike, but he said 
teacher morale is plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a crisis situation now," Newcomer said. "Everyone had expected a 
settlement. Morale is way down. . . . For the last month and a half, we have 
just barely been treading water." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are planning to wear blue armbands on campus as a sign of protest, 
Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
According to administrators, the strife is fueled largely by disagreements over 
how the community college should spend or save its money. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wood, vice president for administrative affairs, said the college, which 
had traditionally operated on a tight budget, has a surplus of about $2.5 
million. He said the money is considered "savings" and was raised partially 
from the Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a budget of about $30 million," Wood said. "A $2.5-million reserve is 
a reasonable amount." 
</P>
<P>
But the faculty claims that the $2.5 million is too much money to have left 
over and it should be given to teachers, who for years went without their fair 
share because of the college's slim budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The college has adequate financial sources to satisfy our reasonable requests 
and do the other things it wants to do," Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood called the teachers' request "impractical." 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we have the money this year does not mean we will have it next 
year," Wood said. "It is one-time money," and the faculty's proposed contract 
would require the funds to be available year after year. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the Rio Hondo teachers' salary currently ranks seventh among 71 
community colleges throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we may not have fared well, but that is not the case right now," 
Wood said. "It is dollars that separate us. We are still far apart."

LACK OF WIND KEEPS CHEETAH AT BAY IN CABO SAN LUCAS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheetah's sprint to the finish in the 13th biennial race from Long Beach to 
Cabo San Lucas turned to a crawl Wednesday night when the wind died near the 
tip of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The Peterson 66 ultralight, co-skippered by Dick Pennington and Phil Murray of 
the Long Beach Yacht Club, held a lead of about 25 miles over second-place 
Grand Illusion, a Santa Cruz 70 skippered by Ed McDowell of the King Harbor 
Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Cheetah, which has led the race since last Saturday's start, radioed an 
estimate that she was two hours from the finish at 8:30 Wednesday night -- 
still in position to claim first-to-finish honors as well as victory in both of 
her handicap classes. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Rouse's Taxi Dancer from Long Beach Yacht Club had the previous day's 
longest run with 232.3 miles as the wind freshened to 15 knots. Cheetah logged 
214.3.

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
LEAGUE TO PROBABLY GO WEST FOR EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although King owner Bruce McNall, a member of the NHL's expansion committee, 
has made it clear that he would like to see a couple of West Coast teams 
included when the league eventually expands -- and that San Jose would be an 
especially nice place for one team -- the Bay Area's hopes soared a few days 
ago when Barry Shenkarow, president of the Winnipeg Jets, seconded the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Shenkarow, also a member of the expansion committee, was quoted in the Winnipeg 
Free Press as saying: "I think everyone has just about recognized that a team 
will be located in the Bay Area. . . . The general feeling around the league is 
that there is a bias toward getting two teams in the West." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose is investing $100,000 in a public-relations effort involved in 
lobbying with the NHL and keeping San Jose's name out front as an expansion 
city. That's a small percentage of the $100 million the city is putting into 
its planned downtown arena. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose backers are also soliciting ownership proposals, including one from 
former Hartford Whaler owner Howard Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
No decision was reached on how eligibility standards for the Calder Trophy 
might be changed, but the rookie-of-the-year award was debated at length Monday 
in a meeting of the league's general managers at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's Serge Savard, a leader among those who think it is ludicrous to 
consider newcomers from European leagues "rookies" on the basis of their lack 
of NHL experience, reported: "The feeling is that we need much more discussion. 
The chance of changing anything this year is very difficult. It's just about 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Cliff Fletcher said it would be difficult to change the rules with 
the season "25% over," but then he wouldn't be in much of a hurry to change the 
rule to eliminate Sergei Makarov, the current leading candidate for the award 
despite his many years of experience with the Soviet Central Red Army team. 
</P>
<P>
David Poile of Washington, chairman of the general managers' group, said: "It's 
an emotional issue. Hindsight is always 20-20, and maybe there should have been 
an amendment before this current wave of older players from Europe. But we 
can't turn back the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Another issue discussed by the general managers was the possible use of video 
replays to help officials. After much discussion on that subject, there was no 
consensus on what to recommend to the board of governors. Poile said: "We see 
what the NFL has done and we've been going over it for three or four years. 
We've not been able, through experimentation and discussion, to come up with 
something that can be done." 
</P>
<P>
A denial came from Yuri Koralev, a coach with the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation, 
responding to charges made by Igor Larionov in his book, "The Front Line 
Rebels," that Soviet players worked with laboratory officials to fix drug tests 
during the 1986 World Championships in Moscow by switching urine samples. 
Koralev said: "Everything was invented by Larionov." 
</P>
<P>
According to Larionov's book, clean urine samples were hidden behind the 
toilets for the Soviet players to submit. 
</P>
<P>
Larionov also wrote that before the world championship in Sweden in 1981, he 
refused an injection of "an unknown substance" and was not selected for the 
team. Helmut Balderis, now with the Minnesota North Stars, indicated during an 
interview in Toronto recently that many Soviet players were given injections. 
</P>
<P>
But the Associated Press quoted Balderis as saying that the injection Larionov 
refused was glucose. 
</P>
<P>
With Edmonton under .500, rumors of a coaching change have surfaced. The word 
was that Glen Sather, the coach who led the Oilers to their four Stanley Cups 
but who was bumped upstairs after last season, would be making a comeback, 
replacing his former "co-coach," John Muckler. Not so, Sather said. He said 
Muckler is a good coach and will be the Oilers' man "for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Penalty minutes are down all over the league, but Toronto, which leads the 
league both in brawls and in average penalty minutes (26.5) a game, seems to be 
going against the grain. While most teams are moving away from fighting and 
high-sticking -- seven teams averaged more than 26.5 minutes last season -- 
Toronto seems to have adopted the rough stuff as a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the charge of Minnesota Coach Pierre Page, who is not happy 
with the three penalty-filled games his team has played against Toronto in the 
last two weeks. He was especially upset at the Maple Leafs' John Kordic, who 
hit Minnesota's Brian Bellows with a high stick during the second period of a 
game Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Page also told the Globe and Mail that Toronto Coach Doug Carpenter was trying 
to psych out his players. "He was yelling and screaming at our players," Page 
said. "He was trying to get something going, and not too many coaches in the 
league will do that." 
</P>
<P>
Some final words on Toronto's fracas with the New Jersey Devils two weeks ago: 
</P>
<P>
Toronto goalie Mark LaForest, on his fight with New Jersey goalie Sean Burke: 
"I told him to take his mask off, and he obliged. So I hit him." 
</P>
<P>
Viacheslav Fetisov of the Devils was so embarrassed by his poor showing in the 
brawl that he asked teammate Jim Korn for some pugilistic tips. Fetisov said it 
wasn't that he never had a fight on skates in the Soviet Union, but it had been 
a while. He needed to brush up. "I haven't had a fight in 10 years, not since 
the world juniors and my first three years on the Soviet national team," 
Fetisov said. "I forgot some things. Now I remember them. . . . I'm mad at 
myself. I'm guilty of not being prepared (for the fight). It won't happen in 
the future. I reacted much too calmly." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say he didn't react at all. He just let Toronto's Wendel Clark "smack 
him repeatedly." A picture that ran in the Toronto Sun showed Clark about to 
land a punch while Fetisov waits with a look of horror. Asked if he had seen 
the picture, Fetisov said: "I have it hanging over my bed." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
The surprising Chicago Blackhawks are leading the NHL with 29 points. The 
Blackhawks didn't have 29 points last season until Jan. 1. The Blackhawks have 
a winning streak of seven games, their longest at Chicago Stadium since 
October, 1983. . . . The Buffalo Sabres are 8-0-1 at home. . . . On the other 
hand, the New York Rangers have lost five consecutive games. . . . Speaking of 
slumps, the Quebec Nordiques dropped eight in a row, a club record and also the 
longest losing streak in the league this season, before beating the New York 
Islanders last Thursday night. Peter Stastny had his first hat trick of the 
season in that game. Joe Cirella said: "We weren't uptight, but you start 
getting worried about what's going on, particularly the young guys who have 
never experienced this before. The breaks were all going one way." . . . Paul 
Reinhart of the Vancouver Canucks will be out at least 10 days with a sprained 
ankle. Reinhart leads the Canucks with 21 points. . . . Pittsburgh Penguin 
Coach Gene Ubriaco: "You're paid to win. I understand that. Let's face it, 
anybody can get paid to lose."

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
AS USUAL, CANADIENS' ROY HOLDS OFF JETS, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Goaltender Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens is usually the calmest man on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Winnipeg Jets show up, Roy gets excited. 
</P>
<P>
Roy stopped 25 shots Wednesday night at Montreal and led the Canadiens to a 5-1 
victory over the Jets that enabled Montreal to tie the Buffalo Sabres for first 
place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 8-0 against the Jets, had his toughest test in the first period, when he 
made 13 saves. He held the Jets scoreless for 47 minutes while the Canadiens 
were building a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 9-5-0 this season, lost his shutout when Pat Elynuik scored with less than 
13 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal broke the game open in the second period when it scored three goals 
while outshooting the Jets, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
Shayne Corson and Stephane Richer each scored his ninth goal for the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Richer is becoming the key offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
"I just show up every night," he said. "The way I've been playing just gives me 
more and more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Hartford 2 -- Although his record against the Whalers isn't perfect, 
the Bruins' Andy Moog is at his best when he faces them. 
</P>
<P>
In a game at Hartford, Conn., Moog stopped 24 shots to improve his record 
against the Whalers to 11-3-1 and extend the Bruins' unbeaten streak to five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' Bob Joyce, who had not scored in 13 games, had his first goal and 
an assist to lead the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, New Jersey 1 -- Clark Donatelli scored on a breakaway 95 seconds 
into overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., to give the North Stars their fourth 
victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Jon Caajsey stopped 30 shots to become a 10-game winner and put 
Minnesota just four points out of first place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Muller scored for New Jersey at 2:50 of the second period, and Dave Gagner 
tied the game at 14:35 with his 10th goal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey failed to score on six power-play opportunities. The North Stars, in 
the last 28 situations in which they were a man short, have given up only two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, St. Louis 2 -- The Maple Leafs trailed, 2-0, late in the first 
period at Toronto, then scored five times in a row to turn the game around. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Osborne's goal at 14:35 of the second period put Toronto, 10-10-0, in 
front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal for the Blues was the 18th of the season for Brett Hull. DAN

PRICE SPIRAL IN HOME SALES LEVELS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although the rapid growth in housing prices witnessed earlier this year has 
softened, strong demand led to a record number of October transactions 
involving existing houses in metropolitan San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
According to sales statistics released Wednesday by the San Diego Board of 
Realtors, 1,632 houses and condominiums were sold in October, the most since 
the board was "regionalized" in 1983 by merging El Cajon, La Mesa, Chula Vista 
and San Diego memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The number of transactions surpassed the record of 1,599 units sold two months 
earlier in August, and represented a 46% increase over the 1,116 transactions 
posted in October 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, the runaway housing-price spiral seen earlier this year has apparently 
run its course for the time being. Although October's average sales price of 
$210,831 was up 18% from the October 1988 figure of $178,908, the average price 
has remained relatively flat since April, when an all-time average record price 
of $217,802 was set. 
</P>
<P>
The October median price -- or the price at which half of all houses sell for 
more and half for less -- was $179,500, up 17% over the $152,900 median price 
of October, 1988. According to the board's statistics, median resale figures, 
too, have hardly fluctuated. Since April, the median price has stayed within a 
range of $175,000 to $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of new houses sold in subdivisions seem to have flattened as well. 
According to a recent survey of subdivisions conducted by Market Profiles of 
San Diego, the average cost of a new single-family house sold during the 
three-month period ended Sept. 30 was $258,590, down slightly from the $259,021 
average price recorded in the second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this year's third-quarter average price was up 22% over the 
$211,609 average posted over the same period last year, said Russell T. Valone, 
president of Market Profiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group, a La Jolla-based research firm that also tracks new sales, 
reported a median sales price of $249,900 for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 
up 34% from the $186,000 of the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The pattern of escalating prices has run its course," said William H. Malone, 
a Meyers Group senior consultant. "People are taking a step back, reconsidering 
the situation. They just won't pay such high prices any more. The frenzy we saw 
earlier this year is no longer." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said prices should continue to stabilize but limited supply will prevent 
them from plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have to worry about too much product," Meyers said. "In San Diego, 
political restrictions (slow-growth legislation), lack of developable land 
because of San Diego's topography, among other things, will keep a restraint on 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group also reported that the median price for new attached units, 
such as condominiums and townhouses, for the three months ended Sept. 30 was 
$153,900, up 29% from the $118,900 price recorded from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is a normalization of the market," Valone said. "Last year, 
in addition to the normal factors that typically increase demand, such as 
businesses' opening and immigration, we were confronted by an artificial factor 
such as no-growth propositions that rapidly increased sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
"People were rushing into the marketplace trying to get a home before the 
county shut down," Valone said. "Although the concern for the no-growth 
movement is still present, it's certainly not as urgent an issue today as it 
was in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in the number of new houses sold reflects Valone's comments. In the 
third quarter of this year, 2,744 single-family and multifamily units were 
sold, down from 3,178 in the second quarter of 1989. The slowdown is even more 
apparent when this year's third quarter figure is contrasted with the 4,386 
units sold over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a softening in the overall marketplace, including the resale 
market," said Jim Hansen, a regional manager of the Fieldstone Co., one of the 
county's largest home builders. "Since the majority of new sales are move-up 
buyers, when the resale market softens, we're affected, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have finally seen the speculative portion of the market disappear," 
Hansen said. "In the early part of 1989, because of the scarcity and excess 
demand, speculators came in and created even more of a demand. The prices were 
pushed up as high as they could go, and it created a super-hot market. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis J. Casey, an official of HomeFed Bank of San Diego, said: "I wouldn't 
say it's a soft market, but it certainly isn't as vibrant as it was last year." 
</P>
<P>
Although residential mortgage rates have been declining in recent months, Casey 
said fewer home buyers are taking advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The rates have been declining for the past couple of months, and we're at 9 
7/8 right now (for a 30-year fixed rate loan)," Casey said. "Typically, when 
rates fall into single digits, you see a pickup in mortgage rate loans. But we 
haven't seen much of a demand." 
</P>
<P>
Casey attributes home buyers' disinterest to several factors, including 
exorbitant housing prices. "Housing affordability is still a factor," Casey 
said. "With prices still so high, few families can afford to buy a home." 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he expects to see interest rates continue to fall until June, 1990. 
From that point on, however, he said, home buyers can expect a moderate upturn 
in rates for the rest of the year. "It's conceivable that you could see 
fixed-rate mortgages somewhere in the mid-9% range" through June, 1990, Casey 
said.

EDUCATION: A JUDGE ORDERED A REVISED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT, DELAYING 
PLANS FOR A VENTURA CAMPUS. MEANWHILE, THREE NEW CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY 
OPPOSE THE PLAN.

<P>
California State University officials this week lost a court battle over plans 
for their proposed Ventura campus, and they braced for strife with a new 
slow-growth contingent on the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A Ventura judge Monday ordered the university to redo the lengthy environmental 
impact report for its proposed university center at Taylor Ranch, delaying the 
project for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a top Cal State official said last week's election of a slow-growth 
slate of candidates to Ventura's City Council could stymie the university's 
plans here. 
</P>
<P>
"A major question in light of the recent election is whether the community is 
interested in a facility of any variety," said Jack Smart, Cal State's vice 
chancellor for university affairs. "We'd want to discuss this with interested 
community people." 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, three of the four council members elected last week 
expressed serious environmental concerns about Cal State's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Smart's remarks, made during an interview with The Times on Tuesday, were the 
first public indications of any possible reluctance by Cal State to pursue its 
plans for a new Ventura facility. 
</P>
<P>
But the university's more immediate problem stemmed from a decision Monday by 
Superior Court Judge Joseph Hadden. In a suit brought by Citizens to Preserve 
the Ojai, an environmental group that wants to block the Cal State development, 
Hadden ruled that the university's environmental impact report for the Taylor 
Ranch project is flawed and violates the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
Hadden found that Cal State's document should have gauged the environmental 
consequences of building and operating a full four-year university. Instead, it 
examined only the impact of a 2,000-student extension center for juniors and 
seniors -- a facility that university officials have described as a possible 
step toward a four-year campus. 
</P>
<P>
Hadden ordered the document rewritten -- a process that Smart said would 
require at least six months. He said Cal State trustees would confer before the 
university begins its new report. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the university argued in court that development of a four-year 
campus in Ventura was "sheer speculation." 
</P>
<P>
"How valuable would it be to do an EIR for a four-year campus that might not 
ever come to fruition?" asked Cal State attorney William G. Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Hadden, however, sided with Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, which contended that 
the full campus "is not only reasonably foreseeable, but actively anticipated 
by CSU." 
</P>
<P>
The expanded report might persuade university trustees to look elsewhere for a 
Ventura County campus site, suggested an attorney for the environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the university trustees had a clear idea of some of the problems 
here," said Philip A. Seymour, of the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense 
Center. "They may very well conclude they've spent a lot of taxpayer dollars 
and gotten themselves into a position they want to get out of." 
</P>
<P>
Hadden based his decision on a California Supreme Court case involving a 
proposed expansion of the University of California's School of Pharmacy. In 
that 1988 case, the court ruled that UC San Francisco erred by focusing only on 
the expansion's first phase in its report and ignoring the school's likely 
additional expansions. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large 
project into many little ones, each with a minimal potential impact on the 
environment which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences," the Supreme 
Court concluded, quoting a previous ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State trustees have been negotiating with Santa Barbara heiress Cynthia 
Wood and her mother, Aileen B. Claeyssens, for a 464-acre piece of Taylor 
Ranch, a hillside spread commanding a view of Ventura and the ocean. The 
trustees approved the environmental impact report on the site in May. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmental groups have vigorously criticized their choice. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia Inc., the Ventura-based outdoor clothing and gear company, 
commissioned a private study of the Cal State report and accused trustees of 
"dealing in bad faith" by not considering a four-year university in their 
report. 
</P>

In their suit, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai took the trustees to task on a

TWO DEVELOPERS CHALLENGE STRICT HOUSING QUOTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The threat of a lawsuit by developers challenging sharp limits on the 
construction of new housing in Ventura has increased dramatically in recent 
weeks, according to both city officials and developers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are reviewing letters on behalf of two Orange County developers 
that challenge Ventura's slow-growth housing policies on two separate legal 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusk Co. and Presley of Southern California, two Irvine firms seeking to 
build major developments in the Ventura area, are protesting city plans to 
allocate 1,850 new housing units over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter written on behalf of Lusk, the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn 
&amp; Crutcher challenged city housing allocations on the basis that they will 
be linked to developer agreements that might unfairly force developers to pay 
for added city services in exchange for construction rights. 
</P>
<P>
A broader attack was mounted in a separate letter on behalf of the Presley 
company, arguing that Ventura's plans for 1,850 housing units fall far short of 
legally binding regional housing quotas. 
</P>
<P>
The quotas, set by the Southern California Regional Assn. of Governments, or 
SCAG, on behalf of the state Department of Housing and Community Development, 
call for construction of 4,116 housing units in the city from 1989 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carreras, a senior housing planner for SCAG in Los Angeles, said the 
regional housing quotas are prepared every five years in compliance with state 
law and are intended partly to allow "the free working of the marketplace" in 
housing construction throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carreras noted that cities can seek a downward revision of the quotas 
if they think local housing must be limited for any number of reasons, he said 
the city of Ventura did not seek an adjustment last year when SCAG set its 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes them more exposed to a possible lawsuit than most cities," Carreras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of a lawsuit aimed at a legal resolution of Ventura's continuing 
growth controversy was increased partly by recent public comments by City 
Councilman Richard Francis, indicating that most future housing allocations 
might be linked to developer agreements. 
</P>
<P>
In such arrangements, developers typically pay for such city facilities as 
sewer lines or wider roads in exchange for the right to build. However, state 
law makes successful legal challenges possible in cases where such agreements 
force developers to provide more services than can be reasonably justified. 
</P>
<P>
Although Community Development Director Everett Millais said this week he does 
not expect most future construction to be linked to developer agreements, 
Francis argued that such arrangements are likely to be the rule rather than the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really what I think will happen," Francis said. "I also think there is a 
high chance of a legal challenge in the near future. The city can argue that 
its resources, such as water, are limited and can only sustain a population of 
102,000. But there is the potential that some court somewhere will tell us we 
have the means to bring water here and that we must therefore allocate more 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge by the Presley company to Ventura housing policies was written by 
Orange County consultant Hardy M. Strozier, who accused Ventura city officials 
of using the water supply "as an unfair reason to restrict growth." 
</P>
<P>
Strozier told The Times that Presley's position is that SCAG housing quotas for 
the region are legally binding on Ventura, and he said discussions of a lawsuit 
among developers are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"If this council proceeds on the path it's on, a lawsuit is very likely," 
Strozier said. "You're probably looking at the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Greenberg, Ventura city attorney, said a city study of the legal issues 
is not complete, but he added that he does not think the city committed a fatal 
error in not requesting a revision of SCAG quotas last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been desirable if we had done so, but the fact that 
resources are limited is still a valid legal justification for us," he said. 
"The bottom line is that the state law has language that when there are factors 
making it difficult to meet SCAG quotas, you don't have to meet them." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said developers have used the threat of lawsuits in other cities to 
try to pressure local politicians into compromise positions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not going to work here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of housing allocations was before the Ventura City Council earlier 
this month but has been shelved pending the inauguration of three new 
slow-growth council members Dec. 4. City officials say the council may not act 
on the measure until January.

STATE PANEL STUDIES BAN ON PESTICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With everything from house paint to body deodorants under siege for their 
air-polluting emissions, regulators are turning to agriculture, one of the last 
bastions of control-free operations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, local and state growers may lose the use of some pesticides, which 
emit ozone-causing hydrocarbons. At the very least, manufacturers will likely 
have to reformulate their California-sold products to use bases other than 
petroleum products, and their costs will rise. 
</P>
<P>
With Ventura County under federal order to clean up its air, and with 
pesticides accounting for up to 28% of reactive organic compounds that 
contribute to ozone pollution, something had to be done, said Richard Baldwin, 
the county's air pollution control officer. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't touch 28% of emissions, I've got an impossible task to attain the 
federal ozone standard," Baldwin said. "I probably can't do it." Baldwin heads 
a new statewide panel charged with devising methods to decrease pollution in 
agriculture and other businesses that depend on pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin's panel, composed of representatives from federal and state agriculture 
and environmental agencies, the 
</P>
<P>
chemical and farm industries and air pollution control districts, will 
recommend new rules to the state Air Resources Board or the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, along with the Los Angeles area, meets neither federal nor 
state clean air standards for ozone pollution. Ozone, the gas that makes up 95% 
of smog, is formed when reactive organic compounds mix with nitrogen oxides in 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
As in paint and spray deodorants, the petroleum solvents in some pesticides 
emit ozone-forming hydrocarbons. Solvents are ingredients in which the 
pest-killing chemicals dissolve, so they can be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin previously had been unwilling to act alone to impose regulations on 
county growers because that would have made their prices uncompetitive 
statewide. But since the state Air Resources Board recently brought pesticides 
under its jurisdiction, growers in all counties would be hit with the same 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
And that could be catastrophic, said Merlin Fagan, environmental affairs 
director for the California Farm Bureau Federation, an association of 90,000 
growers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan estimated that more than 80% of pesticides used in California are 
petroleum-based. 
</P>
<P>
If pesticides had to be reformulated or were simply unavailable, the 
$16-billion agricultural industry could be strapped with production costs well 
above its competitors in other states, Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not afraid do our share for air pollution, but if we're going to shift 
the cost curve to make us not competitive, it might become more cost-effective 
for growers and ranchers to subdivide and develop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite grower opposition, Baldwin sees now as the time to act. Growers 
question the accuracy of the 28% figure. They say more accurate reporting of 
petroleum-based pesticide use is needed before new regulations are issued. And 
they protest the loss of any weapons in their fight against pests. Still, they 
realize the economic importance of reducing crop-damaging ozone pollution, said 
Rex Laird, director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, an alliance of growers, 
and a member of Baldwin's panel. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in anybody's mind that pollution harms agriculture," he 
said. "We have a vested interest in this." 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the Air Pollution Research Center at the UC Riverside show that 
ozone pollution reduces yields and stunts growth in plants and trees. Just as 
it attacks the tissue of human lungs, ozone attacks the cell membranes of 
plants and trees and thwarts the spreading of tree roots. 
</P>
<P>
The effects are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"On Labor Day or Memorial Day when the cars are bumper to bumper, any lettuce 
planted near the 101 gets burned because of the smog, and the effects lessen 
the farther away from the roadside you get," said Phil Phillips, a farm adviser 
with the University of California extension office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of reducing the emissions that cause air pollution are clear, but 
the solution may be more elusive. Among the challenges Baldwin's panel faces is 
devising rules that will eliminate or reduce the use of oil-based solvents in 
pesticides without creating new problems. For instance, one solution being 
considered is to require manufacturers to reformulate pesticides, using water 
as their base instead of the popular solvent, xylene. 
</P>
<P>
That presents at least three serious problems, said Pradip Mookerjee, a chemist 
with Chevron Chemical Co., a major pesticide manufacturer based in Richmond, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
First, only about one-third of the pesticides most widely used will dissolve in 
water, and to reformulate is very expensive, he said. But if the pesticides are 
soluble in water, they will break down when their particles leach into the 
ground water, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If the product is water-soluble, there is a high probability that it will 
leach through the soil and contaminate water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mookerjee, who is also on Baldwin's panel, sees a potential problem if the 
rules apply to the pure petroleum oil that citrus growers spray directly on 
their orchards to fight various pests. The oil, which contains no added 
chemical poisons, is applied before the fruit appears on the trees, spreading a 
suffocating film over the insects. 
</P>
<P>
"In the modern ecological sense, this is an ideal pesticide," Mookerjee said. 
"But the volume of use is quite high." 
</P>
<P>
But because the oil vaporizes far more slowly than the solvents used in 
standard pesticides, it may well be left out of the new rules, Mookerjee said. 
</P>
<P>
After the panel has done its work and the new regulations are in place, the 
real problem may come in enforcement, said John Taylor, manager of Puregro of 
Oxnard, which sells and applies pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got one or two guys running around the whole county to enforce the laws 
that already exist," he said, referring to the pesticide enforcement agents 
with the county Agricultural Commissioner's office. "I'm all for cleaning up 
the air, but when they are just blowing smoke, it's depressing." 
</P>
<P>
The big agribusinesses will comply with the rules voluntarily, he said. "But go 
out to the farm and see if they comply now. I know they're not."

COMPUTER STUDY FINDS COUNTY MUST CUT AIR POLLUTION BY 40%; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS CONSIDER BROAD RANGE OF MEASURES TO MEET FEDERAL EPA 
STANDARDS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County must find ways to cut air pollution by another 40% to meet 
minimum federal standards, according to information derived from unprecedented 
computer modeling conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The county failed to meet the standards on one out of every six days in 1988, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baldwin, county air pollution control officer, said his agency is 
considering a broad range of pollution-reducing measures, including requiring 
factories and other industrial sources of pollution to modify their equipment. 
At present, only new industry is required to install what is called the "best 
available control technology." 
</P>
<P>
Emissions limits also might be lowered for new industry. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible measures cited by Baldwin include: 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the use of certain pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting emissions from boats that ferry supplies to offshore oil platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring clean fuels, such as compressed natural gas or electricity, for 
automotive fleets with 15 or more vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring methane gas recovery systems for all landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Imposing more restrictions on dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Imposing more restrictions on the kinds of coatings and paints used on houses, 
used cars and boats. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA performed the computer studies as part of a settlement in a lawsuit 
against it and the county Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, an environmentalist group, sued over the 
district's 1982 Air Quality Management Plan, which failed to show means by 
which the county could meet clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement last March set a September, 1990, deadline for the county to 
draft stringent new rules -- a process that required data available only from 
elaborate computer modeling. 
</P>
<P>
Without that data, the district could make only educated guesses on how 
emissions added to weather conditions to produce the daily pollution picture. 
</P>
<P>
"We come up with a grand scheme of things to do to reduce emissions," Baldwin 
said, "but we don't know what that will do to air quality until we put it into 
the model." 
</P>
<P>
If the county does not draft effective rules, the EPA will, and Baldwin said he 
fears it would do so with measures as drastic as gas rationing or restrictions 
on the days one may drive a car. 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA might say no driving on Monday if your license ends in A," Baldwin 
said. "Nobody wants to see those things, and I'm working hard to avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
In computer modeling, scientists feed into the system information on emissions, 
weather patterns and air flows from both on and offshore, said John Vimont, a 
regional meteorologist in the EPA's San Francisco office. The model also 
considers existing population, planned growth and future emission reductions 
from pollution-control programs now in place. 
</P>
<P>
Using software developed over the last 15 years, the computer follows the 
movement of air through a region and predicts how it will react with 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
After several runs, the model pegged the clean-air target at a 40% reduction of 
both oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic compounds, the major components of 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a planning tool," Baldwin said, adding that the error factor is as high 
as plus or minus 30%. "But it tells you if you're going in the right direction. 
It's an extremely complex science to try to link emissions and meteorology to 
air quality levels." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a ballpark figure," Vimont said. 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles produce the lion's share of both sets of emissions in the 
county, according to Ventura County district figures. The oil industry and 
power plants are the next largest contributors, followed by other industrial 
sources and agriculture.

POMONA OFFICERS FILE SUIT IN POLICE, COUNCIL DISPUTE

<P>
The antipathy between police officers and the City Council has grown after the 
filing of a suit by two officers against one councilman, an attempt by another 
councilman to cut the Police Department's community relations budget and a 
statement by a councilwoman that the city is suffering from poor police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Camargo, president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn., and Sgt. Gary 
Elofson sued Tuesday in federal court against Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant 
and the city over Bryant's public release of personal information that they 
contend is confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Councilman Tomas Ursua proposed this week that the police community 
relations budget be cut by $100,000 to finance a city public information 
program. The council approved the proposal in concept, but acting City 
Administrator Tom Fee said he would try to find other money to avoid cutting 
the police budget. 
</P>
<P>
And defending last month's decision to fire Police Chief Richard M. Tefank, 
Councilwoman Nell Soto said a recent gathering of 70 to 80 people in Pomona to 
discuss the community's problems produced a unanimous conclusion that the city 
is suffering from "a lack of police protection." 
</P>
<P>
She said the concern about police service justifies the council's efforts to 
shake up the Police Department: "It's important for people to know that the 
action we took was not taken with a capricious or whimsical attitude but was 
very well thought-out. " 
</P>
<P>
Soto said she does not mean "to indict all the officers. I know some are 
dedicated and doing good . . . There are some officers out there that really do 
deserve to get the cooperation of the City Council, (but) there are some that I 
believe need to go." 
</P>
<P>
When Tefank was fired Oct. 17, council members directed most of their criticism 
at mid-rank officers under Tefank, saying their management style was destroying 
police morale. Mayor Donna Smith, who opposed the firing, said the chief lost 
his job after he refused to dismiss seven officers who were on a "hit list." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, while denying there was a hit list, has said he would like to see the 
dismissal of at least two officers -- Camargo and Elofson. 
</P>
<P>
After the Pomona Police Officers Assn. endorsed an effort to recall Bryant, the 
councilman denounced the group's president, Camargo, as "a psychiatric case" 
and said Camargo had seen a police psychiatrist 48 times since March 30, 1987, 
at a cost to the city of $20,450. Bryant's remarks were at a televised council 
meeting Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant provided additional details of Camargo's case and also alleged that 
Camargo and a police sergeant "are presently under investigation by the Police 
Department internal affairs department for lewd conduct." 
</P>
<P>
He said the information about psychiatric visits came from a city report on 
worker's compensation claims, which he believes to be a public document. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he knew about the sexual harassment and lewd conduct investigation 
because the woman who made the allegation, a former police crime analyst, 
complained to him first. Bryant said he and other city officials began an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In their suit in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Camargo and Elofson said the 
allegations have not resulted in any disciplinary actions against them, 
although an internal investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Elofson, who says he has been under fire from Bryant for years because he once 
arrested the councilman on a drunk driving charge that later was dropped, said 
Pomona police officers are fearful for their jobs because a few disgruntled 
employees constantly feed information to the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Several police officers attended this week's council meeting wearing badges 
endorsing the recall of Bryant. Among them was Sgt. Ralph Fry, who heads the 
police community relations program. 
</P>
<P>
Fry said Ursua's proposal to drastically reduce the community relations budget 
is another attack on the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said he began working on his proposal before much of the controversy over 
the Police Department began, but he believes that most community relations work 
should be performed outside the department. "I don't see why a police sergeant 
was taken off the street and given this job," he said. "I would recommend the 
Police Department shift this guy back to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Ursua's proposal calls for the hiring of a city community relations officer and 
six part-time community ambassadors who would investigate complaints from 
residents, distribute information and serve as liaisons between government and 
the community. Ursua suggested the project be funded by taking $100,000 from 
the Police Department's $270,000 community relations budget. 
</P>
<P>
Smith opposed the plan, saying it would hurt many worthwhile police efforts, 
such as drug education, parenting workshops, neighborhood watch and other crime 
prevention programs. The council endorsed the plan in concept on a 3-1 vote, 
with Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer absent.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raise Debt Ceiling 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 269 to 99, the House gave final congressional approval to 
legislation (HJR 280) raising the public debt limit from $2.8 trillion to $3.12 
trillion. The new ceiling is expected to hold until October, 1990, when the 
government likely will need additional borrowing authority to avoid default. 
The bill also repealed the disputed "Section 89" tax provision that has kept 
employers from deducting fringe benefits that are provided only to selected 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill Archer (R-Tex.) said, "As unpalatable as raising the debt limit 
might be, the financial security of the nation must override our reluctance" to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
No member spoke against the resolution during a brief floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to raise the public debt ceiling.

Approve Defense Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 236 to 172, the House approved the conference report on the fiscal 
1990 defense budget of $305 billion. The bill (HR 2461) makes 1990 the fifth 
straight year in which the Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, has 
declined. The Senate was expected to send the legislation to President George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The bill drew an ideological mixture of opponents. Conservatives disliked it 
because it cut deeply into the "Star Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative and 
ignored many of President Bush's weapons priorities, while liberals said it 
kept defense spending too high at a time of improving relations with the Soviet 
Union and insoluble budget problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the bill funds construction of two B-2 Stealth bombers at a cost of at 
least $500 million each, includes money for both the rail-based Minuteman and 
truck-borne Midgetman missile systems, requires the Pentagon to purchase 
against its wishes a number of V-22 Osprey and F-14D aircraft at a cost of 
several hundred million dollars, and cuts SDI spending to $3.8 billion or $300 
million under the previous year's level.

Oil Spill Liability 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 279 to 143, the House adopted an amendment enabling states to set 
oil spill liability standards that exceed federal standards. The amendment was 
attached to a bill (HR 1465) establishing a uniform federal system of liability 
and compensation for spills in navigable waters. The bill is a response to last 
March's Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. It was sent to conference with the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
The vote kept HR 1465 from preempting the ability of states to go beyond 
federal ceilings set in the bill and impose unlimited liability on oil 
companies and shippers responsible for spills. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor George Miller (D-Martinez) said his amendment affirms "a fundamental 
right of the states" to protect their environments. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent John Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.) said federal preemption solves the problem 
of "a patchwork of overlapping and conflicting laws which may actually impede 
prompt payment of justifiable claims." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to preserve state authority to set unlimited oil 
spill liability standards.

Raise Debt Ceiling 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 269 to 99, the House gave final congressional approval of 
legislation (HJR 280) raising the public debt limit from $2.8 trillion to $3.12 
trillion. The new ceiling is expected to hold until October, 1990, when the 
government likely will need additional borrowing authority to avoid default. 
The bill also repealed the disputed "Section 89" tax provision that has kept 
employers from deducting fringe benefits that are provided only to selected 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill Archer (R-Tex.) said, "As unpalatable as raising the debt limit 
might be, the financial security of the nation must override our reluctance" to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
No member spoke against the resolution during a brief floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to raise the public debt ceiling.

STATE MEET OFFERS GALINDO A CHANCE TO LOSE BAD TASTE FROM A YEAR AGO

Jaime Galindo has ill feelings about last season's state community college 
cross-country meet. 
</P>
<P>
Something that Galindo ate the night before did not settle well and it seemed 
he covered more distance running to the restroom the night before than during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to some pasta place," Galindo said. "I think something in the 
spaghetti sauce got to me. I just felt sick all night and during the race." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Ventura College freshman finished 34th, covering the four-mile 
course at Fresno's Woodward Park in 20 minutes, 26 seconds. 
</P>

"I was kind of disappointed," Galindo said. "I felt that I could have finished 
higher, possibly among the top 20." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Galindo, 19, has a chance to redeem that disappointment as he 
returns to Woodward Park on Saturday with hopes of a top-10 finish. If his 
performances earlier in the season are a valid indicator, he stands a great 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo won the Moorpark invitational, Ventura's opening meet of the season, 
and three Western State Conference meets, including the conference 
championships Nov. 3, as the Pirates won their first conference title in seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But his most impressive performance came at last month's Stanford Invitational, 
where he finished fifth in the open division against runners from four-year 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
His showing at Stanford has brought inquiries from several National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division I schools, including Arizona, which has been among the 
favorites for the national title in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a year older and a year smarter," Ventura Coach Tuck Mason said. "He has 
improved tremendously and is coming off a big track season. The main difference 
is that he has a lot more confidence and is gaining more each race." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Galindo finished sixth in the state track meet at 5,000 meters, running 
a personal-best 14:51. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Galindo remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most mild-mannered guy around," Mason said. "He's has a 
positive outlook on everything. He sets high standards and wants to the best he 
possibly can be. But he doesn't sacrifice his family or schoolwork to achieve 
it -- he places them above his running." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tim Revell, a teammate at Ventura and Oxnard High: "Jaime's not selfish or 
conceited. He puts everything in perspective. Whenever he does well, he doesn't 
like to talk about it all, though deep down everybody knows that he's excited." 
</P>
<P>
The second of three sons, Galindo began running cross-country and track as a 
freshman at Oxnard High. He had limited success until his senior year, when he 
won the Channel League 3,200-meter championship in 9:20 -- almost 50 seconds 
faster than his best the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
His parents support his running but, because of work, have only seen him race 
twice. In high school, Galindo worked at weekend bingo games to earn money for 
running shoes and to earn his way to summer running camps. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about it. He's the best athlete I've ever coached," said 
Art Garduna, Galindo's coach at Oxnard. "He's accomplished everything on his 
own through hard work and dedication. He's done a lot of reading to improve his 
running and is always looking for training tips from other runners." 
</P>
<P>
Three days before last Saturday's Southern California championships, which 
serve as the qualifier for the state meet, Galindo and his teammates are 
training at Arroyo Verde Park, the team's daily meeting site located less than 
a mile from the Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
The talk ranges from women to running shoes, but the soft-spoken Galindo simply 
smiles, acknowledging the comments, and remains focused on the workout, which 
consists of a run through the rolling, dirt trails. 
</P>
<P>
The chattering subsides into labored breathing as the runners hit a steep 
incline and struggle to reach the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon guys, stay together," encourages a barely-winded Galindo as he bounds 
effortlessly up the hill, leaving a trail of runners in his wake. As the path 
flattens, he slows his pace, allowing the stragglers to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo knows these trails well. It is here where the lithe 5-foot-9 1/2, 
135-pound runner has trained and competed since high school, developing his 
endurance and powerful stride. 
</P>
<P>
"Hills are his strength," Garduna said. "It's his forte. He has the perfect 
physique for it. He's got good leg speed and is very good on the downhills." 
</P>
<P>
After practice, Galindo and Mason discuss the upcoming race, which will be held 
on the hilly Mt. San Antonio College course. Galindo must finish among the top 
15 to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo pulls out crumpled newspaper clippings to compare times run on the Mt. 
SAC course last year to those run at last month's invitational. He is worried 
about the number of runners who have run faster than 20 minutes this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Jaime wonders about everything," Revell said. "He's always familiar with his 
competition. It's amazing. He not only knows every world track record, but 
where it was set." 
</P>
<P>
Garduna has the same impression. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not only physically prepared for a race, but also mentally," Garduna said 
"He meditates before each race and always has a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Galindo apparently chose the right strategy last Saturday at Mt. SAC as he 
placed fourth in 20:18. He was the first U. S. finisher in a race where 
foreigners took four out of the first five places. 
</P>
<P>
"This course was right up his alley," an elated Mason said afterward. "He ran a 
hell of a race." 
</P>
<P>
Mason voices uncertainty on how much the race will take out of Galindo for the 
state meet. But Galindo is sure of one thing -- he won't be eating out before 
this race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to take any chances this time," he said. "I'm going to stick 
with mom's good ol' cooking."

Like the fireplace in a cozy living room, everyone on the Thousand Oaks High 
defense gathers around middle linebacker Lance Martin. There might as well be a 
load of bricks sitting from tackle to tackle: Martin (6-foot-1, 218 pounds) is 
as sturdy as a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, only a fool would run smack into a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, the latest challenge for Martin and the lively Lancer defense, 
became Thousand Oaks' fifth shutout victim. The Lancers won, 21-0, to secure 
the Marmonte League title. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a superb all-around athlete who batted .379 last baseball season, leads 
the Lancers with 110 tackles. Against Newbury Park, he intercepted a pass and 
forced a fumble to halt drives in the first half and lead a defensive charge 
that held the Panthers to nine yards rushing in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's performance underscored what all Thousand Oaks opponents have learned: 
Run from tackle to tackle and you are bound to get burned. STEVE HENSON

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF GAMES;

OPPORTUNITY BEGINS FOR THOUSAND OAKS SENIORS

<P>
Several seniors on the Thousand Oaks High football team can vividly recall the 
school's Southern Section championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores that year, they had been promoted from the junior varsity for the 
playoffs. Although the group played sparingly, it was able to share in the 
emotion of the successful four-game march through the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is their turn to try and lead the Lancers all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (9-0-1), the Marmonte League champion and top-seeded team in 
Division II, plays host to Palmdale on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in a first-round 
game. Palmdale (3-7) is the third-place team from the Golden League. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale tailback LaShante Parker has rushed for 1,077 yards and 11 touchdowns 
in 201 carries. The Falcons have allowed 2,664 yards and have been outscored, 
206-153. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has outscored its opponents, 248-67, and has allowed only 1,348 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round Division II games: 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger (7-2-1) vs. Buena, Friday at Ventura High: Buena, in its second 
playoff appearance in two years under Coach Rick Scott, faces a banged-up 
Leuzinger team that is coming off a loss to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was favored to win the Bay League, but finished third after eight 
starters fell to injuries. The Olympians are especially thin in the secondary, 
which must please Jason Isaacs. The Buena quarterback has passed for 1,877 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Leuzinger, quarterback Zac Odom has not been injured. Odom runs the 
option well and is an adequate passer. Marvin Johnson, who opened the season at 
tailback before injuring a knee two months ago, will play only defense. Vernel 
Williams, whose separated shoulder has healed, will start at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (6-2-2) at Palos Verdes (9-1), Friday: The Panthers have a tough 
draw in Palos Verdes, co-champion of the tough Bay League. The Sea Kings are on 
a roll, having won six in a row after falling to Hawthorne in their league 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Blake Anderson, son of Dick Anderson, the former Miami Dolphin 
All-Pro defensive back, is Palos Verdes' leader. Anderson, a senior, runs the 
option well and is an decent passer. He also has returned three kickoffs for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Mark Antrobius has eight interceptions and is the team's best 
wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Anderson and Antrobius, however, the Sea Kings are reminiscent of the 
No-Name Dolphin defense Dick Anderson played on. They have few stars, and their 
success in surprising: In a preseason poll, Bay League coaches picked Palos 
Verdes to finish sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, which finished second in the Marmonte League, boast a rugged 
defense and an imaginative offense under first-year Coach George Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
Two-way starters Joe Smigiel and Jeff Jay are the top players on the line, but 
Phil Pederson and Trevor Cull have also had fine seasons. Linebacker Craig 
Satcher and defensive backs Brad Hansen and Jeff Buchanan head a defense that 
has posted three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (4-5-1) at Arcadia (9-1), Friday: Arcadia is a powerful defensive team 
in the mold of top Marmonte League teams Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park. That's 
the bad news for Westlake, which finished third in the Marmonte behind the 
Lancers and Panthers and qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia has allowed only 90 points, 39 in five consecutive Pacific League 
victories. The Apaches have seven wins in a row since losing to Temple City, 
18-14. 
</P>
<P>
Twins Tim and Tom Pescatello are the running backs in Arcadia's I formation. 
Tom, the fullback, has rushed for 528 yards, while Tim, the tailback, has 578 
yards and an 8.9 average. Quarterback Gino Aluzzi has thrown only 125 times, 
but has 15 touchdown passes and 975 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake quarterback Todd Preston has passed for 1,689 yards, utilizing four 
receivers almost equally. Wide receivers Seamus Gibbons and Erik Holcomb, tight 
end David Monheim and running back Luke Crawford each have at least 25 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Division VIII 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph (2-8) vs. Santa Clara (7-3), Friday at Oxnard High: The Saints would 
appear to have drawn an easy opponent, except for two facts: First, St. 
Joseph's victories have come the past two weeks, giving the team third place in 
the Los Padres League. Second, Santa Ynez needed two fourth-quarter scores to 
defeat St. Joseph, 17-7, in a nonleague game. Santa Clara handed Santa Ynez its 
only loss, 24-20, in a pivotal Frontier League game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's fortunes turned for the better with the return of 6-foot-2 junior 
quarterback Paul Ross, who broke his left hand before the season and missed the 
first seven games. Ross has passed for 590 yards in three games, including 
victories over Paso Robles and Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tailback Pete Baichtal, who also plays outside linebacker, has rushed 
for 572 yards. Two-way starters M.G. Cantero and Lafelle McGilvery are the 
team's best linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Division IX 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore (9-1) vs. Big Bear (8-1-1), Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Big Bear Middle 
School: The Flashes must put last week's 41-0 loss to Carpinteria behind them 
and focus on their first playoff game since 1984. Big Bear, co-champion of the 
De Anza League, is led by senior quarterback John Gump, who has completed 95 of 
154 for 1,126 yards. Gump was the league's most valuable offensive player last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Junior fullback Phelan Piestrup has gained 705 yards, averaging 7.5 a carry, 
and has scored 12 touchdowns. Tailback Steve Roussell has scored 10 times. Zeke 
Piestrup, Phelan's brother, is Big Bear's leading receiver with 23 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear's only loss was a 21-20 decision against Beaumont in its first league 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore has allowed only 81 points, with more than half scored by Carpinteria. 
Junior running back Tory Cabral has a school-record 1,254 yards rushing.

FISHING NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
BORN TO WAR, THE MATT WALSH NOW PLIES MORE PEACEFUL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1942 and the start of U.S. involvement in World War II when Garber and 
Walsh boat builders launched the 65-foot sportfishing boat Matt Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of going fishing, it was drafted as a shuttle boat and from 1942 to 
1949 was known as the Nickel Snatcher. 
</P>
<P>
It got its nickname from the many workers who boarded the Matt in L.A. Harbor 
and were taxied to Terminal Island shipyards for just a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, the Matt was converted back to sportfishing and joined the Pierpoint 
fleet in Long Beach as a half-day boat. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Murphy, 72, born and raised in Long Beach, said he has memories of riding 
the Matt to and from the harbor every day. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Haberfield, 71, of Long Beach, said: "To me the boat is a legend. I 
remember in the Pierpoint days, all one needed to do was go out for a half-day 
trip, and when we returned tails of fish would be sticking out of the sacks." 
</P>
<P>
Jackpots in those days cost just 50 cents to enter. Today the pots range from 
$2 to $5. 
</P>
<P>
When Pierpoint landing closed, the Matt moved to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But again, the Matt lost its landing when a storm shut that pier. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Durr purchased the boat in 1978 and moved it to Newport Beach until it was 
sold to Ray Duane, who moved it to L.A. Harbor Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sukahara of the Cabrillo Marine Museum credits Duane for many of the rare 
exotics on display in the museum's tanks. Being a half-day boat is an advantage 
when an exotic is caught, because Duane can alert the museum to pick it up 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
Duane said some changes will be made this winter with a new all-seat gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Matt Walsh is 57 years young and is still a favorite of many old-timers who 
enjoy the comfort of what anglers refer to as the Fat Matt for its wide beam 
and comfortable ride. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Robert Sias of Gardena, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught 
the whopper of the week. After a 20-minute fight, he decked a 61-pound 
yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Overstreet of Manhattan Beach won the jackpot fishing aboard the 
Sharpshooter with his 22-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Larson of Long Beach, on the Sportking, won the jackpot with a 22-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Milo J. Nicolas of Carson caught a 19-pound yellowtail aboard the Shogun. 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Mann of Wilmington, fishing aboard the GW, landed a 12-pound salmon 
grouper.

A 29-year-old San Diego restaurant owner suspected of setting fire to his 
Imperial Avenue eatery was arrested Tuesday, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
John Raheb, who was under surveillance by FBI and Metro Arson Strike Team

</P>
<P>
Investigators who were following Raheb in an unmarked car stopped him after 
Raheb spotted them, said Jerry Van Wey of the Metro Arson Strike Team. 
</P>
<P>
Raheb was taken to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center.

MAN HURT IN SHOOT-OUT WITH DEA AGENT INDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacific Beach man wounded in a shoot-out with federal agents after an 
undercover drug purchase went awry was indicted Wednesday on charges of 
attempted murder and five other counts, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Richard David Gold, 32, the indictment named Michael J. Clamp, 31, 
also of Pacific Beach, and William B. Chambers, 30, of San Diego, who each face 
two drug-related charges, U.S. Atty. William Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 30, Gold allegedly offered to sell 4 pounds of methamphetamine for 
$30,000 to an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 
parking lot on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When agents moved to arrest Gold, he tried to escape in a car and shot at a DEA 
agent, Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro said, adding that the agent shot 
back, hitting the car window and spraying glass fragments onto Gold's head. 
</P>
<P>
Gold, previously identified as Steven S. Anderson, was taken to Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla in serious condition with head wounds. He later 
was released to federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, 
Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
After Gold was arrested, agents got consent from his roommate, Clamp, to search 
their nearby house, where a dismantled meth lab was found, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
While searching the house, Chambers arrived, carrying methamphetamine, Ferraro 
said. Agents later searched Chambers' Clairemont house and found a dismantled 
meth lab, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold was charged with conspiracy to make and possess methamphetamine, 
possession of the drug, use of a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime, 
attempted murder of a federal officer, assaulting a federal officer with a 
deadly weapon and use of a firearm during a violent crime, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Clamp and Chambers were charged with conspiracy to make and possess 
methamphetamine and possessing meth, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men will be formally charged today before U.S. Magistrate Irma 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the drug offenses, the three could be sentenced to a maximum of 
life in prison and a $4-million fine, Ferraro said. A conviction on the 
attempted-murder charge could bring Gold another 20 years in federal prison and 
a $250,000 fine, Ferraro said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mistrial was declared Tuesday in the case against a 36-year-old man accused 
of murdering his mother-in-law at a Clairemont doughnut shop. Jurors said they 
were hopelessly deadlocked, 11 to 1 for conviction on first-degree murder after 
almost two days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the San Diego Superior Court jury did find Randy Geering guilty of 
illegally exhibiting a gun and burglary in the Jan. 29 incident that left 
Audrey Erbe, 59, dead from a gunshot in the head. Erbe was manager of the 
doughnut shop. Geering's estranged wife was at the store at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Kennedy ordered Geering to appear Nov. 22 for the scheduling of a 
retrial. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said he is prepared to retry the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were brought into court late Monday, and one told Kennedy that a verdict 
was "a possibility" if they had further discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The judge sent them back to deliberate, but they returned five minutes later, 
saying they were "hopelessly deadlocked." 
</P>
<P>
McClain had argued for a first-degree murder verdict, while Charles Elliott, 
Geering's attorney, suggested an acquittal or at most a verdict of involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Geering testified that he accidentally shot his mother-in-law after he whirled 
around in response to a noise and the gun discharged, striking her. But his 
estranged wife testified that she heard him angrily arguing with Erbe.

CANNERY CLEARS HURDLE TOWARD LANDMARK STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A controversial proposal to renovate a Wilmington pet food cannery into a 
restaurant and retail complex received a significant boost Wednesday when the 
Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission voted to designate the building a city 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark status for the Heinz pet food cannery -- which must be approved by 
the City Council -- is important to Wilmington community activists, who are 
battling the Port of Los Angeles over the future of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The cannery is expected to close Dec. 1., and port officials want to raze it to 
make way for an expanded equipment storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
But community leaders want to preserve the 71-year-old cannery for inclusion in 
what will be Wilmington's first commercial and recreational development near 
the waterfront. If the landmark status is approved, the port will be prevented 
from demolishing the building for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opening for us," said resident Simie Seaman, who serves on a citizens 
committee that is planning the waterfront access project. "It's part of our 
history, it's part of the waterfront and it's something that a lot of people 
are interested in. It's a natural for the area." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision caught port officials off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"That is an understatement," said port Deputy Director Dwayne Lee, when asked 
if he was surprised at the commission's vote. Lee said he believes the 
building, which has been added to and has evolved over the years, has no 
architectural significance at all: "It's kind of like the tree house in the 
kid's back yard." 
</P>
<P>
But an aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who requested the 
historic status, said commissioners declared the building a landmark because of 
its cultural, rather than its architectural, significance. Their vote was based 
on the canning industry's historic importance to the Wilmington community and 
the port, said aide Susan Prichard. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said port officials intend to find a way to "recognize the historical 
significance of the structure and at the same time realize our objectives." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he could not provide specifics, he suggested that one means of 
complying with the ruling would be to document the historic significance of the 
cannery in writing and through photographs, to file the documentation in 
libraries or with historical societies and then tear the building down. 
</P>
<P>
Such a solution, however, is not likely to satisfy the Wilmington residents 
committee, which has been pressing the port since last spring to include the 
cannery in the waterfront project. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget it," Seaman said. "We don't want it in pictures. . . . That's 
ridiculous."

AS WILMINGTON SUSPECTED, STUDY FINDS PORT GETS MORE CONTAINERS THAN IT SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles reported Tuesday that it imported nearly 117,000 more 
cargo containers than it exported over a recent 20-month period, heightening 
concerns in Wilmington about the large number of empty containers stored there. 
</P>
<P>
"At what point do we have enough?" Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores 
asked port officials at a Los Angeles City Council committee meeting Tuesday. 
"Are we going to store them forever?" 
</P>
<P>
Flores and community leaders have long complained about the storage of 
containers in Wilmington, but the statistics released Tuesday for the first 
time shed light on the potential magnitude of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Harbor Department does not keep track of containers once they 
enter the port -- many are shipped inland on trucks and trains -- city 
officials said the import-export imbalance is a clear indication that a large 
number of containers sit empty in the harbor area once they are unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
During a 20-month period ending in August, the port imported nearly 900,000 
containers, including 100,000 that were already empty, according to port 
statistics. During the same period, the port exported 783,000 containers, 
including 227,000 that were empty. The average container is 20 feet long, 8 
feet high and 8 feet wide and resembles the trailer on a tractor-trailer rig. 
</P>
<P>
"I can check how the trade balance is between the United States and other 
countries by figuring out how many containers are stored in my district," 
Flores said. "It is getting to be an onerous problem." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on cargo containers were contained in a report prepared by the 
Harbor Department for the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, which Flores heads. Flores asked the department last year to begin 
monitoring the movement and storage of containers in Wilmington in an effort to 
come up with ways to reduce truck traffic in residential areas and eliminate 
unsightly storage yards. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Flores commended the department for coming up with truck 
routes away from residential areas, but she complained the port has not done 
enough about the storage problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know what the solution is, but I want to tell you that we are 
going to draw the line in my district on storing containers that don't have any 
possibility of future use," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Department Analyst Peter Mandia said the port is exploring the 
possibility of opening storage yards further inland, but the report prepared 
for the council cautioned that storage yards in Wilmington will not disappear 
even then, because shipping lines need some "near dock" storage. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and fellow committee member Ruth Galanter instructed the Harbor 
Department to return with a new report in three months that will include 
suggestions about eliminating some of the storage yards in Wilmington. Flores 
also asked the city administrative office to explore the possibility of 
imposing a special tax on containers stored in Wilmington, similar to a storage 
charge assessed by the Harbor Department for containers kept on port property 
for more than one week.

SWITCH OF L.A. WELFARE CASES TO INGLEWOOD DRAWS PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: NEIGHBORS SAY LAST WELFARE OFFICE THERE DREW CRIME, TRAFFIC 
AND TRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A group of Inglewood residents is protesting a county decision to send 
thousands of welfare recipients who are served at an office in south Los 
Angeles to northern Inglewood beginning next week to relieve overcrowding at 
the office on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Public Social Services says extreme congestion at the 
Southwest District office leaves them no choice. That facility, with a caseload 
of 28,000 from the South Bay and Westside, is one of the county's busiest 
welfare offices. It serves clients seeking General Relief, food stamps and 
medical assistance, along with those seeking Aid for Families with Dependent 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Fire Department cited the Imperial Highway office for 
overcrowding in the 133-person waiting room. Hundreds of clients now gather in 
the parking lot during the busiest times of the month, waiting for workers with 
a bullhorn to call them inside. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, all AFDC clients will be moved to a building the county 
leases on Redondo Boulevard in Inglewood. An estimated 12,000 people a month 
will use the new site, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living near the Inglewood facility, which is separated by an alley 
from single-family homes, say that when the county operated a full-service 
welfare office there from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, robberies, 
assaults, loiterers, parking problems and trash were an everyday part of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time that thing was there we had dirty diapers and beer bottles 
everywhere," said Grace Randall, who lives across the street from the facility. 
"Who's going to pick those up? I get sick of smelling dirty diapers." 
</P>
<P>
Will M. Steward, division chief for the social services department, called the 
community's response an overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
He reminded community members that some of those going to the Inglewood 
facility will be residents of that city too. He said AFDC clients will bring 
with them far fewer problems than residents experienced before. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have collected more than 250 signatures opposing the move. They 
pleaded with county officials at a hastily called meeting Tuesday night to 
postpone the decision until the county can study the effect of the office on 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, who represents the area, called the meeting 
between county officials and residents after receiving citizen complaints. He 
said he feared that "12,000 strangers" a month would harm the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr., also at Tuesday's meeting, said the county 
should have given residents more notice about the move. He said he will work 
with residents to monitor the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kaufman, who has spearheaded the citizen opposition, said: "I'm not 
down on the recipient. I'm not down on the child. I'm down that the county is 
moving this into our back yard without any notice." 
</P>
<P>
The county says a majority of the AFDC clients using the facility will be 
single mothers. The previous welfare office at the Inglewood site was a 
full-service facility that included those seeking county General Relief funds, 
most of whom are single men. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evaluated (the residents') concerns and decided to proceed with the 
move," said Carol Matsui, a spokeswoman for social services director Ed Tanaka. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they will station two security guards inside the building 
and one outside. Workers will be hired to keep the area free from trash and 
graffiti. The Inglewood Police Department has also said it will increase 
patrols in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman and other residents still fear trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have 12,000 women," Kaufman said, "you have 12,000 boyfriends." He said 
he plans to document every incident that occurs at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Deborah Madsen, said she was concerned that the office would 
lower the property values of neighboring homes. "I tend to think that welfare 
recipients tend to be less educated, less socially responsive. I tend to think 
that Inglewood is a better place than L.A. because we have fewer welfare 
recipients." 
</P>
<P>
A welfare fraud unit, which does not have visits from clients, now operates in 
the 40,000-square-foot Inglewood facility. It will be moved to the Imperial 
Highway office. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the Inglewood facility, which the county rents in a lease 
that expires in 1996, will have a waiting room that will hold between 150 and 
175 people. Joyce Murrell, director of the Southwest AFDC operation, said that 
space will be more than adequate to accommodate the AFDC clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We have families, women and children waiting out in the cold (at the Imperial 
Highway facility) and the winter is coming on," said Marcine Shaw, a senior 
deputy to County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. "We can't continue that situation." 
She said she saw one woman nursing her baby while standing in the parking lot. 
Another woman was crying as three children hung onto her dress, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rising numbers of clients have put a strain on several of the county's 31 
welfare offices during the beginning-of-the-month rush. The county's overall 
caseload rose by 15% in 1988 and county officials predict that number will 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been overcrowding at the Civic Center office on Skid Row and the 
Rancho Park office in West Los Angeles. The county is consolidating four 
cramped offices in the Long Beach and Harbor area with a more spacious facility 
near Compton. In San Fernando, the county is seeking a new building to replace 
the cramped Maclay Avenue facility.

REDONDO BEACH AGREES TO SHARE SHORELINE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pressured by Los Angeles County officials, the Redondo Beach City Council has 
agreed to guarantee that it will shoulder a $140,000-per-year share of local 
beach cleaning and lifeguard costs. 
</P>
<P>
But council members also backed away Tuesday from a proposal to boost shoreline 
parking meter rates to 75 cents from 50 cents an hour, leaving open the 
question of how they will come up with the promised beach money. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Tuesday to ensure payment of the $140,000 a year after 
receiving an ultimatum from the county, which spends more than $1 million 
annually for beach maintenance and supervision at Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, the county Department of Beaches and Harbors said that if the city 
failed to guarantee the payments to the county in a contract, it could be left 
with the full cost of ensuring clean sand and safe swimming. 
</P>
<P>
To raise money for the payments, City Manager Tim Casey on Tuesday proposed, 
among other options, that parking meter rates be increased to 75 cents an hour 
from the current 50 cents an hour in harbor, pier and beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
But several residents spoke against the plan, and council members did not take 
it up. Mayor Brad Parton later said he thought the key criticism was that beach 
visitors would seek cheaper parking elsewhere, clogging unmetered neighborhoods 
with cars. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners along the Esplanade, where visitors already have to pay 50 cents an 
hour for parking, also protested that the rate increase would make it harder on 
their guests. 
</P>
<P>
If it had been approved, the proposed meter rate hike would have been the 
second such increase in less than two years. In April, 1988, parking rates on 
the Esplanade were doubled to 50 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for that increase was to generate revenue to help offset 
county beach expenditures. But meter revenues in the 1988-89 budget year fell 
far short of projections, and the county received only $57,000 of the 
$140,000-a-year share it had expected. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting the council instructed Casey to study other methods to 
raise money for beach maintenance.

'SCHOOLS FAIL, NOT OUR CHILDREN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We strive for mediocrity." Unfortunately, this is the motto of today's 
education system in America. The smart must integrate with the "dumb" in order 
to make everyone equal and average. Sound familiar? Heaven forbid we would 
actually have a few intelligent people in this country and maybe even somewhat 
challenge the Japanese. Right now we are being beaten by Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Gehl's article was one of the greatest critiques ever written on today's 
education system. He used Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' five steps of dying in order 
to bring today's school system to life. This is fitting in more ways than one. 
Not only is it the cycle which schools in America are going through today, but 
also symbolizes the death and failure of America's socialized education system. 
Today's kids are dying of intellectual ignorance and information depletion. 
Maybe if President Bush would stop sulking over his flag amendment and stop 
mobilizing U.S. borders against a nonexistent threat, he could put his time and 
money into something a little more important. Education would be a good start. 
I guess the combined manpower of Stan and Ollie, I mean Bush and Quayle, has 
failed to think about that yet.

CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having been an occasional beneficiary of former exemptions from tax on capital 
gains, I understand some of the attractions of capital gains tax exemption, but 
the recent arguments concerning this tax have led me to wonder about the logic 
or justice as it relates to securities. 
</P>
<P>
Our economy is supported by numerous merchants. Some deal in suits or sinks. 
Others sell shoes or stocks. Except for the latter, these merchants accept more 
or less graciously the premise that they make or buy something for some cost 
and sell it for a higher price and pay a tax on the profit. Each of the 
enterprises provides employment for its personnel and customers for suppliers. 
Therefore, I am unable to understand just what is the premise that declares 
that stocks are a commodity in trade that should be subject to special 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
If somebody out there in the financial community could explain this to me I 
would be appreciative.

NAMIBIA: RECONCILIATION AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Africa's last colony is moving toward independence on a promise of 
reconciliation after an election that was impressive both in its turnout and in 
its orderliness. The events are a credit to the United Nations, which 
persevered in its efforts to free the territory in the face of decades of 
resistance and opposition from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The election result itself will reinforce the commitment to reconciliation. The 
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which led the struggle for 
independence and the guerrilla war that challenged South Africa's control, won 
57% of the votes for a constituent assembly that now must draft a national 
constitution. That margin assures SWAPO a strong but not controlling voice. A 
two-thirds vote in the assembly is required under the U.N. plan for 
independence, thus requiring cooperation among the parties. The restraint on 
SWAPO will be the more welcome following reports of brutal repression of 
dissidents in its own ranks during the liberation struggle. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma, who almost certainly will be Namibia's first 
president, struck a conciliatory tone following the election. "There are no 
losers," he said. "We are all winners." And, seeking to reassure minority 
groups, he said, "We have no intentions of imposing our views on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
As the election proceeded, SWAPO had modified its once radical platform, 
abandoning proposals for broad nationalization of the private sector. Nujoma's 
commitment will be promptly tested as the constituent assembly convenes and 
seeks early agreement on a constitution so that independence can be completed 
early in 1990. United Nations peacekeepers, who supervised the election and 
certified its results as free and fair, will remain until independence day. So 
they should. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and many Western European nations have promised assistance. 
It will be needed. South Africa is leaving the territory with a significant 
deficit.

NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Heye collection of American Indian artifacts goes back to 1896 when George 
Heye acquired a Navajo buckskin shirt while on an engineering job in Arizona. 
Today, the Heye collection is one of the world's best dealing with the 
aboriginal peoples of North, Central and South America. It contains more than 1 
million artifacts, 40,000 books and 86,000 photo negatives and prints. For 
years, the collection has been deteriorating in a little-visited facility in 
the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, however, the bulk of the collection will be housed in a new museum 
of the Smithsonian Institution devoted to the American Indian. Congress has 
passed legislation providing for construction of a $106-million building on the 
mall next to the Air and Space Museum and across from the National Gallery of 
Art. The legislation, expected to be signed by President Bush next week, also 
provides for a $25-million satellite museum in the federal Customs House in New 
York City to meet terms of the Heye Foundation trust that the collection remain 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
That stipulation had snagged the transfer of the collection to the Smithsonian 
for years. But Julie Kidd, chairwoman of the Museum of the American Indian 
said, "It is a glorious solution." 
</P>
<P>
At last, American natives will be properly honored and represented within the 
nation's premier collection of museums. When the facility is operating, perhaps 
Smithsonian officials will consider frequent exhibitions in the West, where the 
Indian played such an important, and not fully appreciated, role in American 
culture and history.

'NEGLIGIBLE RISK' IS STILL MUCH TOO GREAT; 
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDES: RATHER THAN ALLOWING ANY EXPOSURE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE 
MOVING TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF CARCINOGENIC CHEMICALS IN FOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN and JAY FELDMAN, Samuel S. Epstein, MD, is a professor of 
occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois School of 
Public Health in Chicago. Jay Feldman is national coordinator for the National 
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1958, Congress followed the urgings of Rep. James J. Delaney of New 
York and prohibited cancer-causing pesticides in processed food. But a failure 
of government to apply the law to hundreds of pesticides that were already on 
or coming on the market left the public unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Bush Administration, in its pesticide proposal unveiled last month, has 
joined Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) in calling for the repeal of the "Delaney Clause" in exchange for a 
misleading and ill-conceived "negligible risk" standard concerning pesticide 
residues in food. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in the safety standards of these proposals are a matter of 
nuance -- all give the highly politicized Environmental Protection Agency 
discretionary authority to allow pesticide residues at levels posing 
"acceptable" cancer risks, as determined by the highly questionable 
mathematical models and rubber numbers of risk assessment, without adequate 
protections for vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's "negligible risk" proposal allows one or more additional 
cancers per 100,000 people for one pesticide on one food item, equivalent to at 
least 35 excess cancers annually in the U.S. population. The Waxman-Kennedy 
proposal claims to allow one additional cancer per 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most fruits and vegetables are contaminated with residues of many 
carcinogenic pesticides, neither the Bush nor the Waxman-Kennedy proposal 
considers aggregate cancer risk from a total diet. Under the Administration's 
proposal, and based on EPA's own estimates, residues of 60 carcinogenic 
pesticides on 30 foods would result in about 64,000 excess cancers a year, more 
than 10% of all current cancer deaths. Waxman-Kennedy might yield a somewhat 
lower risk because this proposal does require a partial look at aggregate risks 
from individual food commodities. However, both proposals ignore additional 
exposure to carcinogenic pesticides in water and air, other environmental and 
occupational carcinogens and the unpredictable synergistic interactions from 
these multiple exposures. The proposal further ignores other toxic effects. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the Bush Administration proposal would also deny states the right to set 
higher standards of protection than the federal government. State authority in 
this area serves as an important check on the federal branch, and in most cases 
precipitates belated and reluctant federal action. Florida acting on ethylene 
dibromide in 1983 and Massachusetts acting on Alar in 1986 served to draw 
national attention to issues on which the EPA had been dragging its feet for 
decades. An environmental coalition in California, reacting to an unprotective 
federal government, is now promoting a state measure, the Environmental 
Protection Act of 1990, to phase out cancer-causing pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposal represents a caving in to special interests that have long 
sought to strip states of their power to act where EPA has not. This is 
especially important in light of California's finding, under its Birth Defects 
Prevention Act, that EPA has reached wrong safety conclusions on as many as 58 
of 99 pesticides reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Administration proposal will reverse major trends in reducing 
the use of agricultural pesticides in general and carcinogenic pesticides in 
particular. The Administration plan gives more discretionary authority to 
federal agencies that have abused the public trust on safety issues. These 
agencies will then be free to fling open the regulatory floodgates to 
"negligible risk" levels of innumerable carcinogens in food, water, air and the 
workplace, and thus contribute still further to the cancer epidemic now 
striking one in three and killing one in four Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have already seen through this political shortsightedness. Sales of 
apples fell off dramatically when consumers became aware of Alar residues. Some 
stores have committed to shifting out of the sale of foods treated with 
cancer-causing pesticides. Others have instituted their own monitoring system 
to detect residues. 
</P>
<P>
It is the federal government that must now join in a major drive to rapidly 
phase out the use of carcinogenic and toxic chemicals in pest management and 
the production of the nation's food.

CAR HITS POLE; 2,000 LOSE POWER IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 2,000 Southern California Edison customers in Torrance lost power for 
35 minutes Tuesday night after a car slammed into a power pole anchor, knocking 
down 300 feet of electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings affected were in a residential area bounded by Via 
Campesina in Palos Verdes Estates, Camino de la Costa in Redondo Beach and 
Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance, said Edison spokesman Ted Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told an Edison crew that a car hit the pole anchor on Pacific Coast 
Highway near Anza Avenue about 8 p.m., sending the lines cascading into the 
street. No one was injured in the accident, and the driver drove away shortly 
afterward, witnesses said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTINELA SUPT. TO RETIRE IN 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Valley Union High School District Supt. McKinley Nash, who was 
sharply criticized during the recent school board elections, announced Tuesday 
that he will retire when his contract expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, whose four-year contract was renewed in July, said at a school board 
meeting that he is "not interested in rolling over the contract, and it has 
nothing to do with the new board members." 
</P>
<P>
Nash has been criticized by incoming board members Jacqueline Carrera and Pam 
Sturgeon, who said the 56-year-old administrator wields too much power. Both, 
however, have stopped short of saying they will seek to replace Nash. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of last week's elections, Carrera and Sturgeon will replace two 
longtime Nash supporters, Aleta Collins and Ann Birdsall. Herbert D. Bartelt, 
another Nash supporter, will be replaced by Amparo Font, who has voiced no 
criticism of Nash. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said she asked Nash to address the matter as a response to rumors that 
the new school board was planning to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who holds a doctorate in educational administration from the University 
of Illinois, Urbana, earns $89,326 a year. His annual salary has been increased 
$24,106 since he was hired in 1984.

PRESIDENT'S STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush campaigned as an environmentally concerned candidate, but his 
present stance (Times Editorial Oct. 30) belies that concern. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of advocating stronger protection for the public against toxic 
ingredients, he seeks to lower the standard of protection. 
</P>
<P>
Because health care accounts for one of the largest shares of the national 
budget, it behooves those who oversee government agencies to err on the side of 
caution. The care for one single cancer victim is astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
The image President Bush has portrayed since taking office is a far cry from 
the "kinder, gentler" person he professed to be during his campaign.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
IRONY ON PHILANTHROPY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday is National Philanthropy Day, which will be celebrated in Orange County 
with a breakfast honoring individuals and organizations that have helped those 
in need. Top honor at the fourth annual celebration will go to Athalie Clarke 
of Newport Beach, whose philanthropic activities have included the Arthritis 
Foundation of Orange County, Chapman College and UC Irvine. Clarke will receive 
the Spirit of Philanthropy award. 
</P>
<P>
But this year there is an ironic twist to the celebration. Earlier this week, 
United Way of Orange County said that it looks as if the county -- one of the 
wealthiest in the nation -- will once again fall short of its annual goal for 
charitable giving. It is a puzzling phenomenon in a politically conservative 
county where, presumably, there would be broad support for President Bush's 
"thousand points of light" -- the private support of programs once financed by 
government. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth consecutive year that the county will have failed to meet the 
United Way goal, which was set at $20.5 million, a 10% increase over the 1988 
pledge total of $18.6 million. United Way officials attributed part of this to 
cutbacks in computer, communications and aerospace firms that now have fewer 
employees to solicit for payroll deductions -- the agency's primary means of 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
But these same officials say that they continue to be concerned that county 
residents contribute less per capita than other similar areas in the country. 
According to the 1988 Orange County Survey, residents gave just $8.34 per 
capita to charity, a 30% decline from 1987. The national average is $18.79. The 
United Way itself says that Orange County ranks last in per capita giving 
compared to six economically similar areas of the country including Boston, San 
Diego and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
While United Way has had its problems in the past, it now appears to be on a 
strong course. It is the major charitable organization in the nation. In Orange 
County alone, it aids 121 organizations that help the poor, sick and disabled 
as well as youth and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Charity, as they say, begins at home. Orange County should take better care of 
its own.

ESCONDIDO POLICE CHIEF JOINS RACE FOR SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno announced Wednesday that he will run for San 
Diego County sheriff in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno, who became Escondido chief in 1987 after seven years as Carlsbad's 
police chief, joins three others who have filed statements of intention to 
raise funds for the campaign. They are Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, former San 
Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler, and the incumbent, Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
"Strong leadership is needed" to boost morale in the Sheriff's Department, 
Jimno said, adding that he believes he can beat Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for a change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of his agenda, he said, would be the staffing and running of county 
jails and dispatching officers more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jimno, 47, would not comment Wednesday on specific programs he might 
propose. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he pointed to what he called insufficient hands-on leadership in the 
department, "a jail system which has been so plagued by so many problems it may 
be taken away," and a lack of cooperation from Duffy that he said has led to an 
inadequate department and increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
"When the board and the sheriff argue, and nothing is done for months, costs 
increase. The failure to act on issues continues to drive costs up," Jimno 
said.

</P>
<P>
AZTECS: REASONS VARY FOR DEPARTURE OF 23 SCHOLARSHIP FOOTBALL PLAYERS DURING AL 
LUGINBILL'S FIRST YEAR AS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The photograph Brad Edwards keeps tacked to his bedroom wall is too new to have 
turned yellow, but the image it represents has faded for all involved. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the photo stood for a time when friends are found, when college 
football teammates formed life-long bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is a reminder of the price of success at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is no longer a member of the team; neither are the others in the 
picture -- Darren Cooley, Scott Kilgore and Scott Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, Cooley and Kilgore are among the 23 scholarship players (Cartwright 
was a walk-on) who have left or been removed from the program since Al 
Luginbill replaced Denny Stolz as coach last Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at that picture from that first summer camp when we all were freshman 
(in 1988) and realize all four of us are gone," Edwards said recently. "I look 
back on it, and I just don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the departures vary. Some players, such as offensive lineman 
Ian Dunn and linebacker Haywood Mathis, were dismissed for academic reasons. A 
few, such as free safety Lyndon Earley and linebacker Tom Riley, were removed 
because Luginbill said they were disciplinary problems. One, freshman defensive 
lineman Tom Siufanua, left to be with his ailing mother. Others, such as 
Edwards, a freshman offensive lineman who in spring practice broke his foot for 
the second time in nine months, left because of medical concerns. But many 
simply walked away because they said were tired of football; they no longer 
wanted to adhere to the rigorous physical and time requirements Luginbill 
demands of his players. 
</P>
<P>
"It came to the point where football wasn't fun anymore," said Kilgore, a 
red-shirt freshman linebacker who quit at the start of preseason camp in 
August. "The whole attitude of the new staff was this was Division I football, 
and Division I football can't be fun and games. But you can have fun and still 
work hard." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent loss came last week when running back Darrin Wagner, the team's 
leading rusher and scorer at the time, was suspended for the season for missing 
practice. Luginbill has said he would consider reinstating Wagner next season. 
But he says he has not heard from Wagner since several days before the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's departure comes at a time when the Aztecs have returned to winning for 
the first time in three seasons. They enter their game at No. 7 Miami Saturday 
as the first Aztec team since 1977 to win five games in a row. Their 6-3-1 
record, with two games remaining, assures them of a winning season for the 
first time since their 1986 Western Athletic Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stayed are seeing their hard work rewarded. But a third of the 
returning scholarship players from last season's 3-8 team, attracted to SDSU 
after the success of 1986, no longer are around to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there were some guys who were saying, 'I told you so' after our slow 
start," defensive end Todd Coomes said. "I'm sure they're thinking different 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he expected some attrition of holdover players as a result of 
the change in coaches. He said he does not consider the number of players lost 
to be unusually high. 
</P>
<P>
"You are always going to have attrition," Luginbill said. "You just never know 
where it will come from." 
</P>
<P>
Most of it came from the players Stolz brought into the program. Of the 23 who 
are no longer with the team, 20 were recruited during Stolz's three-year tenure 
as coach. One was a holdover from Stolz's predecessor, Doug Scovil. Only two 
were signed by Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a choice," Luginbill said. "Nobody was treated any differently. Hard 
work at times is not fun, but there are certain things you have to do to be 
successful. One of them is you better be in physical shape to play the game of 
football the way it should be played." 
</P>
<P>
The attrition began soon after Luginbill took over and imposed a set of team 
rules that included closer attention to classroom responsibilities and a 
structured off-season training program. The off-season included weight 
training, conditioning drills and other exercises. Luginbill said the program 
was more demanding than the one that existed under Stolz. But he said it was a 
necessity and he was willing to accept the loss of some players. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to start over, so be it, because if we don't have the type of 
football player, the type of young man, who cares about being the best he can 
be, then I don't think we can win football games," Luginbill said. "I know the 
investment it takes in order to be successful. (The demands were) a change for 
San Diego State. But that would not have been a change at USC or Arizona or 
Arizona State. That is normal procedure, but it was a drastic change here." 
</P>
<P>
The losses leave Luginbill with 76 scholarship players. That number includes 
red-shirts, players who are out with injuries and junior running back Tommy 
Booker, who is sitting out this season for personal reasons and might not 
return. That is 19 below the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. limit of 95 for 
a Division I-A program. It will be some time before the Aztecs are at full 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
With 18 seniors among that group of 76 scholarship players, the Aztecs can 
expect to have 58 returning players next season. Because NCAA rules limit a 
school to 25 new scholarship recruits each year, the Aztecs likely will have 83 
scholarship players next season. The recruiting restriction means the Aztecs 
will not be able to sign enough players to reach the 95-player limit before the 
1991 season. That puts the Aztecs in a possible competitive disadvantage in the 
Western Athletic Conference, where most teams are close to or at the 95-player 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
A full roster gives teams more flexibility, allowing them to red-shirt more of 
their incoming classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it easier to have 95, but we have got 80 some (sic) out there, and we 
have had good practices," Luginbill said. "I would like to have 95 because we 
are competing against people that have 95, but we won't get there for three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, that is not bad news for a financially strapped SDSU athletic 
department. The loss of players has meant a savings in scholarship money. The 
department savings for unused scholarships for the 1989-90 school year could 
reach $100,000, department officials have said, with football providing a 
reasonable share of that. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said financial considerations have had nothing to do with the 
attrition. Still, he says he does not regret the loss of most of the departed 
players. Only four -- Earley, Wagner, and quarterbacks Scott Barrick and Brad 
Platt -- had ever started. Most of the others were deep reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he was at a loss to explain the departure of only three -- 
Cooley, a red-shirt freshman defensive tackle, Kilgore and Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones that wanted to quit didn't want to play the game," Luginbill said. 
"It was a cut-and-dried decision." 
</P>
<P>
But for all he asked of them, almost all the players interviewed said they are 
not bitter about their experience under Luginbill. They blame their departure 
on a difference in football philosophy. The change from Stolz was more of an 
adjustment than most said they wanted to make, especially for those players who 
were not getting into the games. 
</P>
<P>
"Football required a lot more time and effort than it had in the past," said 
Vince Pellerito, a reserve offensive lineman who quit in mid-September. "It was 
a lot of work, and I wasn't getting much out of it. There is no incentive when 
you don't play." 
</P>
<P>
For all but two players, leaving the football team did not mean leaving 
college. Almost half of those who continued their college educations stayed at 
SDSU, where Pellerito is one of 10 former players enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Pellerito also is one of a handful of former players still on scholarship. NCAA 
rules require that a player who voluntarily leaves a team in midterm must 
remain on scholarship until the conclusion of that semester. The rule is 
designed to protect the athletes from coaches who might pressure them to leave 
a team so that they could give their scholarship to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he understands the rationale behind the rule but opposes it in 
application. He said it rewards the unworthy. He said when a player quits, his 
scholarship should be revoked immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"When you quit, you should be subject to normal rules like other students," 
Luginbill said. "There is a tremendous protective device (for those who quit), 
and I'm not in favor of it. It is totally wrong, but if that is the environment 
we're in, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
But for those who no longer have their athletic scholarship, their departure 
has meant they have had to fund their own education. Some, such as Platt, have 
taken part-time jobs. Platt, the starting quarterback for most of last season 
until he was replaced by Barrick, has worked in an athletic shoe store since he 
quit the team in August. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I wasn't happy playing ball anymore," said Platt, who was beaten 
out of the starting job by junior Dan McGwire. "I couldn't see myself sitting 
around and not playing." 
</P>
<P>
Platt, like most of those who have remained at SDSU, said he does not intend to 
play college football again. That differs from the majority of those who have 
left SDSU. Many of those have continued their athletic careers. Seven are in 
football programs at community colleges. Only one former player, quarterback 
Jack Skoog, has transferred to another four-year school, and he did so to pitch 
on the Michigan State baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Those playing football at the community-college level said the experience has 
renewed their interest in the game. They said playing, even if it is at a lower 
level, is more enjoyable than sitting the bench at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a good time," said Doug Blanchard, an offensive lineman at Orange 
Coast College. "I knew I'd be bummed out if I didn't play football again. If I 
stayed at San Diego State, I'd probably be on the scrub club (scout team) on 
offense. I didn't work hard in the summer to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he does not understand such remarks. He said that if some of the 
players who quit had been more patient they might be playing now. He cited the 
case of running back Daryl Crawford, a senior who quit the team three weeks ago 
having never played in a game. Since then the Aztecs have lost Wagner, leaving 
them with only three active running backs on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows," Luginbill said. "If Daryl Crawford stuck around, maybe he would 
have had a chance to carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
But Crawford, like the nearly two dozen others that left before him, was not 
willing to wait and work under Luginbill's exacting ways. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he is willing to accept the loss of Crawford and other players 
because he believes a stronger program will emerge in the end. He cites the 
Aztecs' success this season as proof that the team is making progress and says 
he is not bothered by the loss of so many players because he said everyone who 
left was provided a chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not one young man that left this program that wasn't been given the 
opportunity to produce," Luginbill said, "and production is the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State offensive tackle Tony Nichols, who missed last week's game 
against Wyoming with a sprained ankle, is probable. Reserve inside linebacker 
Eric Thompson (sinus infection) is questionable. . . . Running back Curtis 
Butts missed practice Wednesday to visit a family member hospitalized after an 
auto accident and is expected to return to practice today, Coach Al Luginbill 
said.

CSUN'S FANN WINS OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF YEAR HONOR IN WFC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Albert Fann of Cal State Northridge has been selected offensive player of the 
year in the Western Football Conference by a unanimous vote of conference 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a junior tailback, not only led the WFC in rushing and kickoff return 
yardage, he also had a better passing-efficiency rating than his closest 
competitor for the award, Darren Del'Andrae, Portland State's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Fann did a little (and often a lot) of everything for the Northridge 
offense. The junior from Cleveland High rushed for 1,377 yards, added 540 yards 
in kickoff returns, was second on the team with 32 receptions for 242 yards and 
was two for two on option passes for 38 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, 6-foot-2, 215 pounds, accounted for 46% of the yardage Northridge gained 
rushing, passing and returning kickoffs and punts. In the Matadors' final two 
games -- victories over Cal State Sacramento and Southern Utah State -- Fann 
accounted for 684 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of a kind, at least in this conference," Northridge Coach Bob Burt 
said. "He's very deserving of the honor. I think he's the best player in the 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Fann is a three-time first-team all-conference choice who has a chance to 
become the first four-time selection. 
</P>
<P>
Fann and Del'Andrae are the WFC's nominees for this year's Harlon Hill Award, 
the Division II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy. Texas A&amp;I running back 
Johnny Bailey, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s career rushing leader, 
is a heavy favorite to win the award for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bailey is a senior, leaving the door open for Fann as a serious 
contender next year. 
</P>
<P>
"(Winning) the Harlon Hill will be one of my goals," Fann said. "But that's 
something that has to do with your team's record and going to the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae, a junior from Calabasas High, directed Portland State to its third 
consecutive conference championship. He completed 203 of 344 passes and led the 
WFC with 3,016 passing yards and 16 touchdowns. Del'Andrae was joined on the 
first team by Santa Clara wide receiver Travis Bargeman, a former Alemany High 
standout. Bargeman had 43 catches for 944 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge tackle Jim Matthews, a 6-4, 275-pound senior, was a first-team 
selection for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which finished in a second-place tie with Southern Utah, had three 
seniors chosen first-team defense -- tackle Mike Meehan, linebacker Daved 
Benefield and cornerback Willie James. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Clayton Bamberg, a junior safety, made the first team as a kick 
returner. He took back two punts for touchdowns this season.

BERCUTT SHOWS HIS METTLE AS GOALIE HELPS HARVARD SINK MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is how Larry Bercutt spends his time after classes let out at Harvard 
High: He hurries to the school's pool, leaps into about 10 feet of water and 
then lets all of his buddies slam hard, wet volleyballs off the bridge of his 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
Bercutt does it during the summer too. And sometimes before school. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bercutt has gotten so good at this activity -- as goalie for Harvard's 
water polo team -- that he was named the Southern Section 2-A Division Player 
of the Year last season. This season, the senior All-American is impressing the 
3-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"Bercutt's definitely one of the best goalies around. He makes a difference out 
there," Mission Viejo Coach Ron Osumi said after fourth-seeded Harvard had 
defeated the Diablos, 9-5, in Wednesday's Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal 
match at Harvard. "On a couple of our shots, under the same circumstances with 
a different goalie, we would have had goals." 
</P>
<P>
Bercutt, who had 10 saves, is the last line of defense for Harvard, which 
killed eight of the nine situations in which the Diablos had an extra-man 
advantage. And Bercutt rules the defense with an aggressive style rare among 
high school goalies. 
</P>
<P>
"You have really got to come out there and direct the defense," Bercutt said. 
"If the defense does what I want them to, we can set a trap." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harvard Coach Rich Corso: "Larry is now starting to realize he has to come 
in and out. That it really screws up the timing of the two-meter man." 
</P>
<P>
With Bercutt providing stout defense, Harvard attacked Mission Viejo (14-11) on 
offense. After a scoreless first quarter, the Saracens scored four times in the 
second quarter to take a 4-1 lead. Brian Border poked in a rebound early in the 
quarter, and, one minute later, Ryan Crosbie scored from close range after a 
length-of-the-pool assist from Bercutt. Hasan Yardimci added a goal on a 
penalty shot before Crosbie's second score of the quarter finished the 4-0 
outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's spree was especially impressive given the nature of the scoring. The 
Saracens continually outraced Mission Viejo -- winner of 14 of the past 15 4-A 
Division swimming titles -- to its defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
"We fast-breaked them into the ground," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
Crosbie, Border, Yardimci and freshman Jim Toring each scored twice. Mission 
Viejo closed to within three goals twice in the third quarter at 6-3 and 7-4, 
but late fourth-quarter goals by Yardimci and Ryan Salceda meant a date in the 
semifinals for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard (26-4) won the 2-A championship last season and lost in the division 
final in 1987. The Saracens will face top-seeded El Toro on Saturday at a 
neutral site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Corso, as usual, is not intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with what they've done," he said of his team. "(But) they know I'm 
not going to be satisfied and that I have high expectations of them and the 
program."

NO LONGER RIVALS, SISTERS SPARK MIRALESTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miraleste High tennis players Erica and Christa Hanson are not only sisters, 
they are also partners on the tennis court. Five years ago, the partnership 
wasn't working nearly as well as today. 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly fought," Erica said. 
</P>
<P>
They are no longer sibling rivals, however. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the combination of Erica and Christa has produced one of the best 
tennis duos in Southern California. They are the top players this year for 
Miraleste, an outstanding tennis program that has won two of the last three CIF 
team titles and was runner-up to Corona del Mar last year. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste can qualify for the 4-A Division finals again with a victory today at 
2 p.m. over host Palos Verdes, with whom the Marauders have split two matches 
this season. The rivals tied for second in the final 4-A rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their recent successes, the Hansons haven't always had it this easy. 
</P>
<P>
Like most sisters, they've had their share of disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there was the time they were losing a match and Christa started 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Erica, who is 17 and can be described as a typical older sister, full of 
advice and maturity and who often finishes sentences for her younger sister: 
"This car went past and was playing a song real loud, and Christa started 
singing along between points. I started yelling at her. We ended up losing the 
set." Erica was 12, Christa 11. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I remember it, but I don't remember it that way. They used to get really 
mad at me, though," said Christa, who was described by Erica as "cute, long 
blond hair, tall and skinny and an airhead." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Linda hasn't forgotten the incident either. 
</P>
<P>
"Erica started crying because she wanted to win so bad," Linda said. "I left my 
daughters, one singing, one crying. That's one of those times a mother doesn't 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
"They are friends but they're sisters, so they fight." 
</P>
<P>
After just a few tournaments together, their parents decided blood was not 
thicker than forehands and that it was best to split up the sister team. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not allow them to play doubles together after the Redlands tournament 
(when the singing incident happened)," Linda said. 
</P>
<P>
However, three years later the two found each other back on the same side of 
the net. The move strengthened their singles as well as doubles careers. 
</P>
<P>
Erica is the No. 1 singles player at Miraleste and Christa is No. 2. Together 
with No. 3 singles player Laura Bak-Boychuk, they form the nucleus of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Erica is more consistent. Christa has her ups and downs," said Miraleste Coach 
Jim Hanson, no relation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Miraleste hopes to avenge an 11-7 loss to Palos Verdes on Oct. 25. Erica 
has lost both of her singles matches against Palos Verdes this year and Christa 
lost her match the last time they played. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited to play them," Erica said. "We feel we can beat them this 
time. The last time was kind of disappointing. We didn't expect to lose and 
things went the other way, and it kind of shocked us (that) we lost." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I could play better than I did," Christa said. 
</P>
<P>
Both have plenty of CIF experience. Erica reached the doubles final in her 
sophomore year and was a singles semifinalist last year. 
</P>
<P>
Christa won her No. 3 doubles finals match in her freshman year but lost the 
No. 2 doubles in the finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
The two sisters also will compete as a doubles team in the CIF individual 
competition when the championships are completed. And they also compete in 10 
to 15 junior tournaments a year. 
</P>
<P>
"They play super together now, but I still hold my breath," said Linda with a 
laugh.

CHATSWORTH SWEEPS PAST EL CAMINO REAL, ADVANCES TO FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top-seeded Chatsworth High girls' volleyball team, despite a 2-0 games lead 
against El Camino Real on Wednesday night at Venice High, did not look like a 
team about to advance to the City Section 4-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
During the third game, setter Kris Bassler felt nervous. Middle blocker Lori 
Mertes began to panic. Coach Steve Berk wore an expression that said, "Uh-oh." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the anxiety stemmed from the fact that Chatsworth knew its Northwest 
Valley Conference rival as well as a friendly neighbor and recalled losing to 
El Camino Real after taking a two-game advantage three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Chatsworth regained its poise after a 13-4 third-game lead had been 
whittled down to 14-10, and the Chancellors won the semifinal match, 15-12, 
15-12, 15-10, to become the first Valley-area team ever to make it to the 4-A 
final. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls were really convinced they could win," a relieved Berk said. 
"Sometimes they have more confidence than me." 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors (14-2), led by Lori Mertes' 13 kills and Marie Mariano's 11, 
had their confidence shaken during the third game against the fourth-seeded 
Conquistadores (13-3). 
</P>
<P>
"They really scared us and we started to freak out," said Mertes of the third 
game. "But we knew if we stuck together, we would win." 
</P>
<P>
Persistance also paid off for the Chancellors in the first and second games. 
Tied, 12-12, in the second game, Chatsworth rallied on a Mertes kill, a Bassler 
service ace, and a Conquistadore error. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real led, 12-8, in the first game before Chatsworth scored the final 
seven points, three coming on Mariano kills. Rachel Berger led El Camino Real 
with 13 kills and Lori Dinaberg added seven. Bassler had 20 assists for 
Chatsworth.

Before approaching Canyon High Coach Harry Welch to talk football, it might be 
wise to bone up on a little local sports trivia. Canyon trivia, specifically. 
</P>
<P>
By beating Saugus on Thursday, the Cowboys won their seventh Golden League 
title in Welch's eight years at the school and improved their league record to 
39-1 during that span. Those illustrious numbers had been in jeopardy at the 
start of the season. Smarting from the loss of injured All-Southern Section 
running back Chris Peery, who was sidelined the first three games, Canyon 
stumbled to a 1-3-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
The team rallied, however, winning its next five games. Still, residue from the 
lean weeks lingers. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Welch was approached by a group of party-goers at a Santa 
Clarita Valley function last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We know you're the football coach at Canyon," one group member said, "and we 
were afraid to ask you how you were doing, because we know it's not going that 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly innocuous icebreaker left the coach steamed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just shook my head," Welch said. "It caught me off guard at first. I wanted 
to explain that we had just played the most challenging schedule that I had 
ever been involved in. We had a young, inexperienced team that was missing its 
most valuable player. . . . Actually, I said nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The expectations put on the team by the surrounding community, Welch says, are 
often unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I try to smile at it but it carries over to the team," he said. 
"Yeah, I guess we're not that good. We just outscored opponents, 176-27 
(163-29, actually), in league games." 
</P>
<P>
Tough crowd. 
</P>
<P>
King-sized: The player most hurt by Camarillo's offensive woes this season was 
wide receiver Mitch King. As a junior, the 5-foot-9, 165-pound King had 40 
receptions for 561 yards. 
</P>
<P>
This season, when Camarillo quarterbacks passed for only 524 yards, King had 16 
catches for 275 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Rough break: Initially, Carlos Guerra thought the thwap from beneath his 
shoulder pads was the sound from a piece of plastic that had cracked. Instead, 
when he stood up after the tackle, reached under his jersey and clutched his 
tingling shoulder, the Poly tailback found it was his collarbone that had 
snapped like a brittle bread stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra, Poly's second-leading rusher, was injured on the team's first drive 
against Grant last week after picking up 15 yards on a pitch. The play put an 
abrupt end to the season for the 5-foot-6, 140-pound senior nicknamed "Speedy" 
by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Because he underwent surgery to remove bunions on both feet, Guerra did not get 
much playing time until Poly's third game. Still, he gained 498 yards in 67 
carries and scored five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about it was the kid worked so darn hard and he got tackled 
and boom," Coach Fred Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
No sour grapes: Traditionally, when teams are on the bubble for playoff berths 
and don't get picked, you get some high-volume whining and moaning from the 
coaches left out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
But not at L. A. Baptist, which just completed an impressive 7-3 year. "Even if 
we were on the council," modest first-year Coach Mark Bates said, "we wouldn't 
have picked us." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights lost out on a sure playoff bid, losing to Western Christian, 14-7, 
in a regular-season finale with second place in the Alpha League on the line. 
But this year's record was the best of the decade at the Sepulveda school, 
resulting in an aura of good feelings within the program. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one problem left for Bates and his staff: "We still don't know 
what to do with our afternoons now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rush hour: Followers of City Section 3-A Division football recently may have 
noticed the name of Leon Gable turning up in their papers with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
After the North Hollywood junior's name have been impressive rushing digits. 
Considering that in the early season the Husky rushing game rested almost 
exclusively on junior Mike Lewis, it seems strange that Gable's name would turn 
up now. 
</P>
<P>
But Gable, according to Coach Fred Grimes, was the No. 1 tailback before being 
injured in his first carry of the year. Thus, Lewis, who stars in the Husky 
defensive secondary, was given the call. But since Gable has been able, it's 
been all Leon. 
</P>
<P>
He has gained 954 yards in 134 carries and, last week against Sylmar, netted 
268 yards in 29 carries for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I had high hopes for him (before the injury)," Grimes said. "I believe he's as 
good as (former Husky and current Cal State Fullerton running back) Chip Grant 
was as a junior." 
</P>
<P>
Title for real?: The unofficial score charts at the Southern Section 
cross-country finals last year listed Camarillo as the winner of the 4-A 
Division. However, as the official results were released, the Scorpions were 
stunned to discover that Dana Hills had edged them, 86-90, for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our hearts broken," Smith said of the race. "We were walking around for 
about 20 minutes thinking we were champs." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Camarillo has remained modest in the face of its competition but 
still has some unfinished business in the 4-A final Saturday at Mt. San Antonio 
College. "Now, we hope to finish the job that we didn't quite finish last 
year," Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
Add Camarillo: Derek Kite missed running in the Scorpions' 4-A preliminary heat 
Friday because of a swollen toe. Kite, a senior transfer from Agoura, stubbed 
the big toe on his right foot in his home, according to Smith. He is 
questionable for Saturday's race.

FINAL CROSS-COUNTRY DECORATION MISSING FROM RUNNER'S ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
GOAL: BRIAN GASTELUM HAS COLLECTED ROWS OF TROPHIES WHILE FOLLOWING IN HIS 
BROTHER'S FOOTSTEPS. NOW THE BIRMINGHAM SENIOR WANTS TO ADD THE ONE THAT GOES 
WITH A CITY SECTION TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Brian Gastelum stood in the bedroom of his Granada Hills home recently and 
clasped a basketball trophy, the first he had ever won. 
</P>
<P>
While fondly remembering the effort involved in securing the hardware, however, 
it dawned on Gastelum that the trophy, which he won at age 13, was really his 
second. His first came earlier the same year and was more the result of crying 
than trying. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum's older brother Billy had a collection of cross-country and track 
trophies he earned at Birmingham High, so Brian told his mother that he wanted 
one too. 
</P>
<P>
The two visited a local garage sale and Gloria, Brian's mother, bought him a 
volleyball trophy. But the younger Gastelum still was not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted one with my name right here," he said, pointing to the marble base of 
the basketball trophy. "(My mother) put me in a basketball league so I could 
get this trophy. When I got this one, I threw the other one away." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gastelum, a senior cross-country runner at Birmingham, has an array of 
trophies and medals that would make any athlete proud. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd get all these," he said, making a sweeping motion around 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, undefeated in City Section races this season, may have another trophy 
to add to his collection Saturday. He is preparing for a run at the City 
individual championship in the finals at Pierce College. Gastelum has posted 
the fastest time on the three-mile course at Pierce this season, a 14:55 
clocking in the Braves' dual meet with Monroe on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, he won the Valley Pac-8 Conference title and led Birmingham to the 
team championship. He retained his championship in the conference finals Nov. 2 
and again paced the Braves to the team crown. 
</P>
<P>
During his junior track campaign, Gastelum finished second in the 1,600 meters 
in the City track championships in May with a personal-best 4:17.29. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum's cross-country success during his four-years at Birmingham, however, 
probably would not have been possible had he outran Pat Connelly, then a 
consultant to cross-country Coach Gary Mazziotti. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum had been cut from the B basketball team his freshman year but decided 
to stay in the basketball class. While walking near the locker room after 
class, he noticed Connelly and the cross-country team working out on the track. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Connelly looked up in Gastelum's direction. Trying to remain 
inconspicuous, the freshman stepped behind a green tarp covering the chain-link 
fence surrounding the track area. 
</P>
<P>
The split second when Gastelum's and Connelly's eyes met served as a starting 
gun for the two, and Gastelum bolted for the gym, with Connelly, who had 
coached Gastelum's brother, closing fast. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught me (in the gym) and he said, 'I want you to bring your running shoes 
tomorrow and you're going to run,' " Gastelum said. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly first learned about Gastelum from Billy, a 1986 graduate of 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly, who also worked in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program in the 
Los Angeles Police Department while coaching at Birmingham, helped organize 
mini-Olympics events at several elementary schools throughout Los Angeles. He 
was at Nestle Avenue School in 1983 when he saw Gastelum, then in the fifth 
grade, run in a mini-Olympics 600-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know he could run," Connelly said. "But when I saw him run in that 
600, I said, 'That kid's not playing basketball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum still wasn't sure that cross-country was his sport but never missed a 
chance to work out with his older brother and the high school team "just to be 
with the guys." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be like the rest of the group on the team and go on long runs with 
them," Gastelum said. "(My brother) said, 'No, you can't because you're not in 
shape and you're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
J. R. Vasquez, an '86 alum of Birmingham and one of Billy's high school 
teammates, recalled an incident in which Gastelum was trying to break into his 
brother's training clique. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy and I we're running and Brian was . . . in seventh grade and he'd come 
around and say, 'I ran a 5:20 mile today,' " Vasquez laughed. "We were like, 
'Sure, you're only a seventh-grader.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though Gastelum wanted to run with his brother just for fun, he had no interest 
in enduring the competitiveness of the cross-country team his freshman year, or 
any other year. Instead, he tried out for B football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go out for cross-country or track because I didn't like it. I 
didn't like running," Gastelum said. "I went out for B football (but) I was 
just too skinny. I was getting hit too hard and I couldn't take it. I got cut. 
The coach said I was going to be a tight end, but I didn't know what that was. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said, 'Hmm, I like playing basketball.' So I went out for it. It was kind 
of late, but I talked the coach into letting me try out. He said I wasn't good 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness for Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
However, during the latter part of his sophomore cross-country season and 
through his 1988 track campaign, Gastelum sustained a hip injury that hampered 
his summer training regime. 
</P>
<P>
A change in coaches after his sophomore track season did not offer much relief, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to Birmingham, I was told a lot about Brian," second-year 
Coach Scott King said. "I remember the first week of workouts, he only came one 
day out of five. I started wondering what the deal was. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't really sure if he wanted to go through the pain again. I think what 
he was going through was that he wasn't sure if he was even going to run 
again." 
</P>
<P>
But Gastelum showed up for the entire second week of practice and has not 
missed two workouts in a row since then, King said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had recovered from his hip injury, a cold contributed to a 
disappointing performance in what was to be the race of his junior year, and he 
struggled to finish 64th in the City championship. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Gastelum's poor showing last year, Obed Aguirre of San Fernando is 
the favorite for the individual title this year. Being an underdog suits 
Gastelum fine. "That way there's not a lot of pressure on me," he said. "If 
there's a lot of pressure on me I might break." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as Gastelum proved when he won a City track championship his freshman 
year, it would not be a wise move financially to bet against him. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum won a bet with his father, Bill, who said that he would buy his son a 
new bicycle if he won the C 1,600 meters at the City championships in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The young novice held off junior Paul Klinedinst of Granada Hills in the final 
stretch to win in 4:31.22. Klinedinst timed 4:32.21. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycle he was given leans against a wall, a nice addition to Gastelum's 
already well-decorated bedroom. Also lining the wall on one side of Gastelum's 
room are letters of interest from colleges, including Stanford, Cornell, Notre 
Dame and Columbia as well as Cal State Northridge and Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
However, along the opposite wall are flyers and pamphlets regarding Scholastic 
Aptitude Test preparation courses. "That's just stuff from school," he grinned. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, several tests await Gastelum.

NEW MANAGER IN CSUN'S CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiny, windowless and crammed with boxes, room 212 in the Physical Education 
Building at Cal State Northridge is the temporary headquarters of the athletic 
department's new business manager, Debby De Angelis, who has to share the 
cracker box with a football coach, a track coach and her computer terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The makeshift arrangement reflects the frenzy in which CSUN is getting ready 
for its move to Division I beginning in the 1990-91 school year. De Angelis 
relocated here from Boston earlier this month to find a computer accounting 
system that was not in place and a new office building that was not finished by 
its target date this month. 
</P>
<P>
But De Angelis, 41, isn't about to let a few glitches get her down. "I'm just 
happy to be back in Southern California," says De Angelis, born and raised in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
To go into big-time athletics, CSUN needed a business manager for the athletic 
department "to pull all sources of income together," De Angelis says. Her 
responsibilities include the overall athletic budget and "looking for a deal" 
in everything from purchasing equipment to making travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Until CSUN hired her, she had a similar position at Northeastern University in 
Boston for the past six years. At revenue-poor CSUN, she will have to make 
money go a long way. But that ability is on her resume. "They hired me from a 
place that had to squeeze the dollar," says De Angelis, who has a master's in 
sports management from the University of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
De Angelis took the CSUN job on the condition that she be allowed to continue 
her volunteer work with the U. S. Rowing Assn. in Indianapolis. A former rower 
who was once an alternate on the national team, De Angelis represents U. S. 
women's interests at meetings of the sport's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Women rowers were second-class citizens until fairly recently -- they weren't 
even allowed in the Olympics until 1976. De Angelis, working for the USRA since 
1978, has helped push through rules changes -- such as increasing the racing 
distance from 1,000 to 2,000 meters, the same as the men's -- and create a 
junior championship event for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect I'm fairly typical of American women," she says. "I believe anything 
a man can do, a woman can too. But women are still not equal in sports. It's an 
ongoing, uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
In rowing, it hasn't been as difficult getting women in the boats, De Angelis 
says, "as it has been in leadership positions, especially coaching." 
</P>
<P>
De Angelis, women's rowing coach at Northeastern for four years, is the third 
generation of female rowers in her family. As a student, she helped start the 
women's rowing program at UC Santa Barbara and ranked ninth in U. S. singles 
for two consecutive years. But a bad left knee, operated on three times, forced 
her to retire in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of energy left," she says, so she stayed involved with rowing. 
From 1976-80 she was the manager of all the U. S. women's national teams, 
including the Olympic teams in '76 and '80. 
</P>
<P>
Her first few weeks in L.A., De Angelis lived out of a suitcase at a friend's 
house in Lakewood, an hour's drive to Northridge, while her husband was still 
in Boston, tying up loose ends. And then there were all the new faces she had 
to sort out on the second floor of the PE building. It was a hectic time. 
</P>
<P>
"But the dean of students has had the athletic department over for dinner," she 
says, "and I already feel like one of the family." 
</P>
<P>
Now if she could only get her own office.

'WITNESSES' SHOW PRESENTS AIDS AS A COMPLEX ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing," a modest and touching exhibition about AIDS 
at Artists Space, has been catapulted into the national spotlight by a raging 
controversy over government support of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
This may be a very good thing -- coming, as it does, on the heels of a record 
auction season. The clamor will surely draw crowds to an exhibition that would 
get little notice under calmer conditions. If nothing else, visitors will see 
that art can be more than a commodity. It can also be an expression of profound 
emotion, created from experience with no thought of profit. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which opens here tonight and runs through Jan. 6 at the gallery 
in Manhattan's TriBeCa district, was organized by photographer Nan Goldin, who 
confronted the devastation of AIDS when she tried to reconnect with old friends 
after she recovered from drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Goldin originally conceived of a more celebrity show than the one that 
developed. But the reality of death in her artistic community changed her 
vision from one that was essentially life-affirming to a more sober examination 
of vulnerability and loss. Theory gave way to personal experience as she 
enlisted works from artists who had lived and worked on Manhattan's Lower East 
Side. 
</P>
<P>
In the catalogue essay, Goldin says she views the exhibition not as "a 
definitive statement about the state of art in the era of AIDS but as a vehicle 
to explore the effects of the plague on one group of artists in a way that 
hopefully will speak to all survivors of this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The result is typical of theme shows often staged in such "alternative spaces" 
-- noncommercial galleries that struggle along on low budgets but often manage 
to pull off significant projects. 
</P>
<P>
What we see in "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing" is a varied array of works -- 
photographs, paintings and sculptures in assorted media -- linked by a social 
issue. Some of the works are so abstract or oblique in their references to AIDS 
that an unwitting observer might miss the connection. Other images confront 
sexuality and disease directly. 
</P>
<P>
This mixed bag of art is aesthetically incoherent -- and purposefully so. The 
idea was for artists of different sensibilities to respond to the theme, either 
through works they had already made or by creating pieces specifically for the 
exhibition. Some didn't live long enough to see the show, others are sick and 
still others are physically healthy but emotionally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The late Vittorio Scarpati contemplated death with agonizingly imaginative 
clarity in a series of ink drawings done in his hospital bed. Wiry angels, 
mortals and dissected bodies limned on sketch book pages surround a juicy red 
drawing of a heart, rather like petals of a flower, in a display of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Painter James Nares has charted "Heartbeats" as wavy ribbons of pigment on 
canvas and paired them with depictions of ordinary people pushing shopping 
carts or congregating on street corners. The rhythm of their collective heart 
is writ large while their bodies blend into crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality is a theme of some of the work but never the whole story. Allen 
Frame's casual photos of gay people talk about long-term friendships, for 
example, while David Armstrong's photographs are probing portraits of 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Dorit Cypis has bared her body and soul in a series of small photographic 
self-portraits set on shelves. Their clarity contrasts sharply with a large, 
shadowy photograph of a reclining woman, framed (or entombed?) above the 
shelves. This would be an intriguing treatment of human vulnerability in any 
exhibition; in the context of AIDS, the piece, called "Yield," presents the 
body as a highly problematic container that can be diseased and lost while the 
mind watches. 
</P>
<P>
Another effective group of works, Shelburne Thurber's color photographs of 
empty, mundane bedrooms, evokes betrayed secrets and a sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
Other approaches to a troubling theme are Tom Chesley's gritty paintings of 
drifting cages, bridges and hospitals; Ken Tisa's paintings of isolated figures 
searching for their spirits and Greer Lankton's sculptural "Skins," portrayed 
as broken shells of bodies. 
</P>
<P>
There is an undeniable message here, and it is political to the extent that it 
questions a power structure that has been slow to take AIDS seriously. But 
there is no sloganeering and there is nothing that suggests easy answers. Art 
is not proposed as a solution, only a way of examining feelings and issues as 
artist have done through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best aspect of "Witnesses" is that it presents AIDS as a complex 
issue that elicits a wide range of responses. Rage, denial, grief and 
transcendence are all filtered through the artists' perceptions and made 
visual. 
</P>
<P>

BACKGROUNDThe AIDS exhibit at Artists Space was originally supported by a 
$10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The grant was withdrawn 
Nov. 8 in the wake of the controversyNEA's funding of allegedly obscene 
photographs. Endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer's explanation of the action 
cited the politically charged nature of the exhibit; this raised concerns that 
a new Endowment provision aimed at denying federal funds to artwork judged 
obscene will be broadened to effect political censorship.

SCHOOLS PLAN TO MEET NEEDS OF LATINOS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BILINGUAL AIDES, STUDENTS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO BECOME INSTRUCTORS. 
</P>

<P>
Long Beach Unified School District officials are developing a master plan to 
address the needs of non-English-speaking students and a program that would 
encourage bilingual aides and students to become teachers, according to a 
district report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are in response to recommendations made earlier this year by a 
Hispanic Advisory Committee, which noted that the number of bilingual teachers 
is inadequate to serve the district's Latino students -- half of whom cannot 
speak English proficiently. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the committee's recommendations, schools Supt. Tom Giugni 
presented a 25-page report to the School Board on Monday, emphasizing the 
district's commitment to serving Latino students and increasing the ranks of 
bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
While encouraged by the new plans, the Latino leaders expressed disappointment 
about the overall report, which they called "a rehash" of existing district 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they were disappointed that one of their priorities -- requiring 
teachers and administrators to learn a second language -- apparently has been 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The report appeared to sidestep most of their specific suggestions and offered 
very little in the way of future plans, committee members complained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rehash," Jerome Torres, the chairman of the Hispanic Advisory 
Committee, told the School Board on Monday. "We already know you guys have this 
program and that program." 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Roberto Uranga, president of the local chapter of LULAC, the 
League of United Latin American Citizens, told the board: "We're very 
disappointed with it. It was superficial." 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Giugni detailed the various programs available in areas of 
concern that the advisory committee cited in its report to the board last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the committee asked the district to develop an internship program 
to cultivate existing Latino staff for future administrative appointments. In 
his response, Giugni implied that the district is doing what it can in the 
area. He explained that the district's program for leadership development 
includes opportunities to participate in various councils, committees, morale 
building programs and "other growth enhancing activities." Among other things, 
each assistant superintendent keeps a list of potential administrative 
candidates, Giugni wrote. His response did not address the specific suggestion 
of creating an internship program. 
</P>
<P>
Giugni's report did, however, include some new elements. The most significant 
of proposed changes, according to committee members, are creating a program 
that would encourage bilingual aides and students to become teachers and 
developing a master plan for students who have limited English proficiency. One 
out of every four students in the district does not speak English proficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders said they are grateful to district officials for the strides 
that have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members also said they were encouraged that the teachers' union 
seems willing to compromise on a committee proposal to pay bilingual teachers a 
higher salary. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with members of the committee, leaders of the Teachers Assn. of 
Long Beach agreed to consider supporting a plan that would pay bilingual 
teachers more when they go beyond their teaching duties, such as by helping 
develop the curriculum or by working with new teachers, said Felice Strauss, 
the union's president. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher's union has traditionally opposed a bilingual pay differential. 
</P>
<P>
While district officials avoided flatly opposing most of the recommendations, 
they virtually rejected what was probably the committee's most radical 
suggestion: that teachers, administrators and other staff learn a second 
language if at least 30% of the students in their school can't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a commendable recommendation; however, the district does not view the 
recommendation as one of the high priority issues. . . . It would be difficult 
to decide on a specific second language, and a project of this magnitude would 
not be cost effective," Giugni wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When it was first presented this summer, the concept of requiring a second 
language was viewed with skepticism by most school board members, teachers' 
union officials and top district administrators. But the idea was supported by 
the Assn. of Hispanic Educators in Long Beach. On Monday, Alan Lowenthal, the 
president of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, threw in his group's support 
and called the proposal "a positive development." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed that they (district administrators) didn't supportthe 
second language requirement," Uranga said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As for the overall report, he said: "The language was saying, 'We're doing all 
these things, what more can we do?' We wanted them to show us, with hard data, 
whether those programs are working, and what more they plan to do in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hansen, the district's assistant superintendent of personnel services, 
said officials emphasized existing programs rather than those in the discussion 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to put into this report things that are actually being done,"Hansen 
said. "(But) we have other irons in the fire." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said officials are talking about developing a magnet 
schoolwith a curriculum focused on encouraging students to become teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what a big job we have," Hansen said. "We're going to keep at it until 
it's completed. We're committed." 
</P>
<P>
District administrators said they are making some progress on new bilingual 
hires. Between January and September of last year, for example, the district 
hired 20 bilingual teachers, or 10% of the 200 new hires, according to Giugni's 
report. Since September of 1988, the district hired 28 bilingual teachers, or 
11% of the 255 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're having a hard time finding minority applicants," Hansen said. 
"It's a state problem and a national problem." 
</P>
<P>
The National Education Assn. predicts that only one public school teacher in 20 
will be a minority by the turn of the century.

LONG BEACH COUNCIL TAKES TOUGH STANCE IN VOLATILE CONTRACT TALKS WITH POLICE 
UNION

City officials have again extended bargaining talks with the police union, 
while warning that they will carry out their threat of imposing a new contract 
if a settlement is not reached soon in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council first indicated two weeks ago that it was on the verge of 
declaring an impasse and adopting its version of a new contract with the 
610-member police union, a move that would propel the contract fight into court 
and underscore the mounting animosity between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
But at the advice of city staff, the council Tuesday gave negotiators another 
week to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"If something doesn't happen within the next week, we are going to have to deal 
with the issue," Mayor Ernie Kell said to a packed council chamber overflowing 
with police officers in and out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Declared Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton: "We're getting close to the end of the 
line and that's a fact." 
</P>
<P>
The council has adopted an unusually hard line in the negotiations, siding with 
management's demands for major changes in the Police Department's personnel 
policies. Three bargaining sessions in the last two weeks yielded little 
movement on those key negotiating points, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Police union President Mike Tracy welcomed the week's extension, saying it 
would help keep the "lid on potentially a very volatile situation in this 
city." 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that if management imposes a new contract on his union, the 
city would be violating its labor agreement. "We would consider it the terms 
and conditions of imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy later dismissed the council's comments as "posturing for negotiations," 
and said management was unrealistically expecting the union to abandon 
personnel policies it had won over the span of many years and many labor 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unreasonable for them to expect we are going to give back in one 
negotiating (season) everything we negotiated for in the past 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
While the city says it is offering handsome raises in return for the 
take-aways, Tracy said the city was not offering enough. 
</P>
<P>
Management claims it needs a number of changes in the contract to efficiently 
run the department: The police chief wants unlimited authority to transfer 
officers from one assignment to another, the ability to send out one-officer, 
rather than two-officer cars on night shifts, and the right to assign officers 
to a five-day rather than a four-day week. 
</P>
<P>
The labor standoff and the city's threat of imposing a new contract have bred 
enormous discontent within the department, Tracy said. "(Officers) are 
extremely hostile. There is an anger and frustration level I have never seen in 
this department." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Tracy said, the union's board of directors continues to oppose a 
walkout or other job action.

CHER'S VIDEO LEAVES NAVY RED-FACED; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE NAVY PREVIEWED HER TUNE BUT NOT HER ATTIRE IN GRANTING PERMISSION 
TO FILM ON THE MISSOURI. HER CLOTHING -- OR LACK OF IT -- TOUCHED OFF FLURRY OF 
LETTERS.

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Navy reviewed the story line and the song lyrics to ensure the 
project's good taste before it gave Cher permission to film her video in Long 
Beach aboard the venerable battleship Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Navy neglected to ask Cher one thing: what she planned to 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 a.m. on the last day of taping over the Independence Day weekend, the 
actress buzzed up in a motorboat and climbed aboard Mighty Mo wearing a black 
garter belt, black boots, a transparent net body stocking and two posterior 
tattoos the size of pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ensemble touched off a flutter over whether such attire was appropriate for 
a battleship of the Missouri's stature: The Japanese surrendered on its decks 
in 1945 in the presence of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy was left with some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she had tattoos, but I never knew they were so big," Yeoman 2nd Class 
Don Cipriano recently remarked after seeing the video, which is so risque that 
MTV cable channel runs it only late at night. 
</P>
<P>
But the 200 or so Missouri crewmen who stayed up all hours to watch the taping 
enthusiastically approved. One sailor even gave Cher his hat, prompting video 
director Marty Callner to declare in a recent Navy newsletter that he was 
"proud to be an American." 
</P>
<P>
But a handful of critics have since grumbled that the historic battleship was 
demeaned by Cher's costume -- salvaged from censorship by a strategically 
placed V-shaped strip of black cloth -- and choreography, in which she leans 
affectionately against one of the ship's impressive 68-foot guns. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider myself to be a prude," a retired Navy commander wrote to the 
Navy after being "arrested" by the video one evening. "I enjoy watching 
scantily clad young ladies as much as the next man. But were I the commanding 
officer or another of the senior people who form a deep personal bond with 
their ship, I would be deeply embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
"She was wearing a see-through body netting that showed her rear end nude," a 
woman from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., steamed in a letter to Navy headquarters in 
Washington, firing off a carbon copy to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Navy, a part of our government that should stand for what is good and 
honorable, is putting its stamp of approval on trash like this . . . What kind 
of image did you hope it would give the Navy?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Navy was hoping to reach MTV's sizable audience of 18- to 
24-year-olds who might be prompted to enlist. However, in a response from Navy 
headquarters written in August and released this week, Lt. Cmdr. A. J. Dooley 
explained that the Navy had expected Cher to wear something more . . . well, 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy worked closely with the producer to ensure the video would be in good 
taste," he wrote. "However, changes during the final stages of production, 
including Cher's revealing costume, were unanticipated, and led to overtones 
that we had sought to avoid during our pre-production planning." 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that Navy brass was offended but there were no official 
statements of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some officers took exception to the criticism, saying the slick video 
gave the impression that the Navy is "a neat place to be." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the ship looked outstanding," Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser in Long Beach 
said of Mighty Mo, which was spit-polished and gloriously lit up against the 
night sky. "I don't think the Navy has anything to apologize for." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cher nor her publicist could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser said future video requests would be considered on a case-by-case basis, 
and even Cher should not assume she has worn out her Navy welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But one junior officer who asked not to be identified said the "moral outrage" 
that emanated from Washington, however slight, will not be soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a cold day in hell before she ever films another video on a Navy 
ship," he said.

ABC DISTRICT GRANTS 6% PAY RAISES IN NEW CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ABC Unified School District has approved three-year contracts with salary 
and benefits increases for teachers and classified employees that will cost 
$4.5 million for the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the school board granted new contracts to the district's three 
bargaining units, including the ABC Federation of Teachers, the California 
School Employees Assn. (CSEA) and the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees (AFSCEME). 
</P>
<P>
All three units received 6% salary increases retroactive to July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, the district's 1,100 teachers will receive a total of 
$3.5 million in salaries, health and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The 6% hike will push starting teachers' salaries from $22,904 to $24,278 a 
year. The top salary scale for teachers with 30 years of service will rise to 
$47,043. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the CSEA will receive a total of $492,000 in salaries and benefits 
during the first year of the contract, while AFSCEME members will get a total 
of $490,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are 940 members in both CSEA and AFSCEME, which include clerk, 
custodians, bus drivers and food service workers. All bargaining units will be 
able to open negotiations on salaries and other benefits next year. 
</P>
<P>
The new raises will come from the district's 1989-90 general budget of $91.7 
million.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS MUSIC STUDENTS PITCH IN WITH EARTHQUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Days after the earthquake struck Northern California last month, faculty, staff 
and students at Cal State Dominguez Hills adopted the city of Watsonville and 
began collecting money to send to the community in California's agricultural 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
A fund was established and a two-week fund-raising goal of $5,000 was set. 
</P>
<P>
But students in the school's music department wanted to do more than just ask 
for money. So they produced a cassette of their best work, and gave it to 
anyone making a $10 donation. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do something creative . . . something in our specialty," said Dan 
Blessinger, a senior, who was a recording engineer for one of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
The nine selections -- including an eerie guitar instrumental, a funky tune 
about a monster who could not dance and a rock song that proclaims: "Nobody 
ever said this would be easy" -- were chosen by students in the department's 
Audio Recording Music Synthesis club from about 25 songs that had been recorded 
as semester projects. 
</P>
<P>
The cassette, titled "Answering the Call," was produced and packaged so quickly 
-- seven days from idea to first donation -- that it even surprised the music 
students who were novices at turning a master tape into a package ready for 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
John Hill, club adviser and audio recording teacher, said the project "was 
something a lot of students could get involved with." 
</P>
<P>
First reactions to the tape were "strong indifference," said John Blum, a 
senior and executive producer of the cassette. But once other students realized 
where the money would go, the donations increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
From a table strategically placed outside of the cafeteria and through 
off-campus soliciting, the music students have raised about $1,000, which will 
be given to the Dominguez Hills fund and forwarded to officials in Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Blischke, executive assistant to the president and coordinator of the 
school's earthquake relief fund, said Watsonville was chosen because "most of 
the media attention and fund-raising efforts were focused on San Francisco and 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that Watsonville, one of the hardest-hit areas, would probably need 
the help." 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville Fire Chief Gary Smith said the situation in the small city of 
29,500 people was still hectic. There are about 400 people living in four 
shelters and about 40 families living in a city park, he said.

The abandoned Uniroyal plant, a Santa Ana Freeway landmark that was built to 
resemble an Assyrian palace, will be redeveloped into a mall, hotel and office 
complex under an agreement approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The city Redevelopment Agency will retain ownership of the 35-acre site and 
lease it to Trammell Crow Co. under the agreement approved recently. 
</P>
<P>
The development, dubbed "The Citadel," is expected to funnel more than $500 
million in lease revenue to the Redevelopment Agency over the next six decades, 
said Justine McCarthy, deputy director of redevelopment. That revenue could be 
used to fund other redevelopment projects or to pay for public improvements 
such as widening roads. 
</P>
<P>
The project also is expected to generate $250,000 to $350,000 a year in 
additional sales tax revenue for the city and to create about 2,000 jobs, 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement requires Trammell Crow to renovate the former tire plant's 
six-story office tower and to preserve all but 150 feet of its distinctive 
1,700-foot wall fronting the Santa Ana Freeway. The 150-foot section will be 
removed to create an entrance to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents a secure future for the city of Commerce, knowing this money 
will come in every year to help the city," Mayor Ruth R. Aldaco said after the 
Council's unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
The lease agreement results from more than two years of negotiations between 
the city and Trammell Crow, which originally wanted to buy the site. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow plans to build a retail mall, five office buildings with more 
than 378,000 square feet of space, and a 201-room hotel on the site. The 
architecture of the new buildings is to blend in with the existing facade. 
Ground-breaking will take place within two months, said Trammell Crow partner 
Kevin J. Staley. The mall section of the development should be ready for 
business in late 1990, he said. The lease agreement requires Trammell Crow to 
complete most of the development within seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce will have invested about $22.6 million in the site by the time The 
Citadel opens for business, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce bought the Uniroyal property from fireworks magnate and convicted 
political corrupter W. Patrick Moriarty for $14 million in 1983. The plant, 
which was built in 1929 by rubber magnate Adolph Schliecher, was closed in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The city also has paid $5.5 million in interest on the property, McCarthy said. 
The city is spending about $2.24 million to remove underground storage tanks 
and to clean soil contaminated with oil and diesel fuel, McCarthy said. 
Preliminary test results indicate there is no contamination of ground water at 
the site, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's lease agreement with Trammell Crow is for 65 years with an optional 
35-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
The lease agreement includes a graduated schedule that requires Trammell Crow 
to pay the Redevelopment Agency $100,000 the first year. The lease payments 
will jump to $1.08 million by the seventh year. After the 11th year, increases 
in the lease payments will be based on the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact study of the project identified two significant 
negative effects -- more air pollution and the loss of part of the distinctive 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The air pollution will be generated from an estimated 19,000 trips a day to the 
complex by cars, buses and other vehicles, according to the environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Removing the section of wall probably will render the old tire plant ineligible 
for placement on the National Register of Historic Places, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce officials, who planned to develop the site, never asked that the 
building be included on the National Register. There are restrictions against 
altering a building on the register. 
</P>
<P>
But McCarthy said the lease agreement prohibits Trammell Crow from removing any 
more of the wall than now planned. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council found that the benefits of the project, including the revenue 
for the city and the jobs it will create, outweighed the negative impacts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be wonderful to see those buildings up when you drive by on the 
freeway," Mayor Aldaco said.

LONG BEACH AGONIZES OVER WAY TO SAVE HARRIMAN JONES CLINIC FROM DEMOLITION; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMISSION FEAR THAT IF 
DEVELOPERS ARE FRIGHTENED OFF, THE STRUCTURE WILL BE DESTROYED ANYWAY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old Harriman Jones Clinic, where some say half of Long Beach's residents 
were born, remains caught between the developer's wrecking ball and 
preservation while city officials search for alternatives to a plan that would 
turn the landmark into condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Amid protests from preservation-minded residents, the Planning Commission last 
week delayed efforts to destroy virtually all but the facade of the 1930 
Italian Renaissance-style building, including the homey waiting room where 
fathers paced by a fireplace while awaiting the birth of their babies. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is now in the hands of the Cultural Heritage Commission, which 
could accept the idea of sacrificing most of the building to save some of it or 
insist that it remain intact, according to the city's historic preservation 
officer, Ruthann Lehrer. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member commission is already divided on whether to hold out for total 
preservation, a gamble that could scare off developers entirely and ultimately 
force demolition of the entire building at 211 Cherry Ave., members warned. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a hard-nose position, you could risk losing everything," Lehrer 
said. "Everyone looks at the fate of the Pacific Coast Club and says, 
'Anything, but that.' " 
</P>
<P>
The city learned a hard lesson from the Pacific Coast Club and the Jergins 
Trust Building, both of which were razed during attempts to save them. The 
sites remain undeveloped holes in the ground to this day. 
</P>
<P>
The city is trying to work with Terry/Nikols Development Co. on a compromise 
for the Harriman Jones Clinic, which costs thousands of dollars a month to 
maintain while standing empty. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to save the facade emerged as a compromise that seemed to please no 
one. It was agreed upon because, in Lehrer's words, "half a loaf is better than 
none." 
</P>
<P>
Then residents turned out in ranks at last week's Planning Commission meeting 
to protest compromise of any kind, complaining the new building would be too 
tall, the architecture too cheap and the attempt to preserve history too 
compromising. 
</P>
<P>
"We have grieved over the loss of the Pacific Coast Club and anguished over the 
obliteration of the Jergins Trust Building," resident Rae La Force, who led the 
effort to save the clinic, told planning commissioners. "As long as the 
Harriman Jones building is still standing, a solution is yet possible. . . . 
Just say 'No!' to demolition." 
</P>
<P>
The matter is due back before the Planning Commission on Dec. 28.

BURBANK AIRPORT NEIGHBORS RETAIN NOISE-SUIT RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council has agreed that residents living near the Burbank 
Airport should be exempt from an ordinance that would have required them to 
give up their rights to sue the airport over excessive noise if they received 
public funds to soundproof their homes. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people from the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League staged a 
demonstration outside Burbank City Hall before the City Council's regular 
meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The city and airport have their tongues hanging out trying to take our rights 
away because they're scared to death of being sued when they double the flights 
at the airport," said Wally Berns, president of the neighborhood group. 
</P>
<P>
The council later voted 4 to 1 to exempt the homeowners from the ordinance, 
which will require developers of new motel, hotel and apartment buildings near 
the airport to install sound insulation. Those developers also will be required 
to give up their right to sue the airport for creating excessive noise before 
being issued a building permit from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert R. Bowne opposed the homeowner exemption, saying he feared that 
the city was opening itself up to legal action by the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the council's decision to exempt 
homeowners might make it more difficult for the airport to obtain federal funds 
to soundproof nearby homes and schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration recently awarded a $2.5-million grant to 
the airport to soundproof Luther Burbank Junior High. The school insulation 
project is part of the airport's long-range noise-relief program for the 
surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said the FAA does not require that homeowners, who receive public funds to 
insulate their homes, must give up their right to sue airports over excessive 
noise. But he said because Burbank Airport is competing with 185 airports 
across the country for federal funds, the FAA might look more favorably upon a 
city that imposes some requirements on homeowners.

GROWTH LIMITS LINKED TO RISING ENROLLMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In its strongest move to control development to date, the Santa Clarita City 
Council has pledged to reject development proposals that would overwhelm school 
districts with new students. 
</P>
<P>
Developers would only win city support, the council said, if they agree to 
cooperate with the Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts to handle 
rising enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved a two-page resolution establishing the policy 
late Tuesday night. The resolution, which codifies what had been an informal 
practice by the City Council and Planning Commission, was approved with little 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution said the city will consider the potential impact on schools when 
it reviews requests for zoning changes and general plan amendments. The council 
passed the resolution at the urging of the William S. Hart Union High School 
District and Saugus Union Elementary School District, where educators say 
rising enrollments are outstripping district services. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the council pledged to abide by a controversial state appellate 
court ruling that gives cities and counties the power to reject zoning changes 
for housing developments that would crowd schools. The decision in Mira 
Development Corp. vs. the city of San Diego, rendered by the state Court of 
Appeal last November, has been praised by school districts and education 
associations as a way to clamp down on growth. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's policy puts it at odds with the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, which has been advised by County Counsel De Witt W. Clinton to 
ignore the Mira decision because it could violate a state law that sets a limit 
on how much money developers must contribute for schools. 
</P>
<P>
To win the support of school trustees for projects, developers might be forced 
to make concessions of land or money to have their projects approved by 
counties or cities, Clinton said. Such concessions could surpass requirements 
of state law, which already force developers to pay school districts $1.56 for 
every square foot of residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita City Atty. Carl K. Newton said that the county counsel 
misinterpreted the Mira decision and that the state Legislature's legal counsel 
has recommended that cities and counties abide by the ruling.

WITNESS GETS DOWN ON ALL FOURS TO DEFEND SLAIN DOG'S REPUTATION

An animal behavior specialist draped in a white sheet and wearing a straw hat 
crouched on all fours in San Fernando Superior Court on Wednesday to 
demonstrate that a dog named Cuddles was neither mean nor aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Cuddles, a brown and white springer spaniel, is the sister of Freckles, a dog 
that was shot and killed while the two animals were scampering on Earnest Lynn 
Reubens' ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Reubens, 59, a 15-year resident of Canyon Country, is on trial in San Fernando 
Superior Court, charged with one count of cruelty to animals and one count of 
using a firearm with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Reubens pleaded not guilty, but according to prosecutors he admitted to Los 
Angeles police that he killed the dog because it was running all over his land. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles belonged to 4-year-old Erica Owen, who received the puppy as a 
Christmas gift two years ago. Her 8-year-old sister's Christmas present that 
year was Cuddles, Freckles' littermate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosalie Morton summoned Cuddles to refute suggestions by 
defense attorney Richard P. Guluzza that Freckles was a big, aggressive animal 
that might have attacked Reubens' sheep. Owen family members said Freckles and 
Cuddles were almost indistinguishable in appearance and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought her to court so the jury could see the sweet, darling dogs that they 
were. They were not killers, or pit bulls, they were pets," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Guluzza maintained that the canine victim's sister is irrelevant to 
the case, Judge Ronald S. Coen allowed Cuddles to appear, noting that the 
defense attorney earlier had asked about Freckles' size. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles was brought to the front of the courtroom on a leash and Morton asked 
Deena Case, a court-appointed animal behavior specialist, to demonstrate a 
segment of the "27-part Danish temperament test." 
</P>
<P>
As bewildered jurors looked on, Case draped a sheet over her body, put a straw 
hat on her head, crouched and began moving toward Cuddles, darting to the right 
and left. 
</P>
<P>
The dog cowered behind its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Case said the test demonstrated that Cuddles was "mildly fearful" when 
confronted with something she had never before seen and was not aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, the Owens' housekeeper, Delia Villeda, admitted that she 
generally let the two dogs run on Reubens' land for nearly half an hour a day, 
when she took walks with Erica's baby brother.

PROJECTED RAIL COSTS EXCEED FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: A COUNTY REPORT SAYS EVEN A SHORT LINE WOULD COST ALMOST TWICE 
WHAT TRANSIT PLANNERS WILL HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited report on San Fernando Valley rail-route options released 
Wednesday suggests that there would be enough riders to support the proposed 
east-west line, but that even a shortened version of the line would cost almost 
twice what transit planners will have available in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
The steeper-than-expected cost estimates -- ranging from $500 million for a 
bare-bones surface system that would run only from North Hollywood to the 
Sepulveda Basin, to $3.5 billion for a cross-Valley subway -- led some county 
transportation planners to predict that the proposed line will not be built 
until well past the turn of the century, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, leading proponents insisted that money could be found, 
although they conceded that construction might not occur as soon as they had 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.1-million environmental impact report was commissioned by the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission, which plans to use it as a basis for 
picking a Valley mass transit route to connect with the Metro Rail subway 
between downtown and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building a county-wide rail network using the extra 
half-cent sales tax that voters authorized in 1980, is scheduled to pick a 
Valley route in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report studied 10 options along two routes, attention is expected 
to center on a plan that would extend Metro Rail partly underground to the 
Sepulveda Basin, where travelers bound for the West Valley would switch to 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
That plan -- which was offered several months ago as a compromise to draw 
together warring factions and which has attracted widespread support -- would 
cost $1.3 billion and would draw 49,000 riders daily by the year 2010, the 
report said. Earlier predictions had been for 30,000 to 50,000 daily riders on 
a longer cross-Valley line. 
</P>
<P>
County rail planners say no more than $600 million to $800 million will be 
available for a Valley line over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
This did not discourage state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who along with Los 
Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude co-authored the compromise plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very encouraged," Robbins said. "I'm convinced that we will find the money 
somewhere," he said, predicting funds will become available from another 
increase in the sales tax or bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Christine Reed, chairwoman of the County Transportation Commission, said 
that if Valley leaders "continue to insist on subway, it's clear from this 
report that nothing will be built for a long time, maybe 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also are to choose between light-rail technology and Metro Rail 
equipment, which has a higher capacity and is slightly more expensive. In 
addition, the commission is scheduled to determine whether the system should be 
at ground level, elevated or in a costly tunnel -- a key question that for 
years has sharply divided homeowner leaders from business interests. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners say a ground-level or aerial line will ruin their neighborhoods with 
noise and ground vibrations, while business leaders insist that a subway is too 
expensive for the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report appeared to buttress both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Along the 15-mile Southern Pacific rail right of way that follows Chandler and 
Victory boulevards across the Valley to Warner Center, a ground-level system 
would cost $1 billion, while the same line as a subway would cost $2.9 billion, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive option, at $500 million, would be a ground-level system on 
this route from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Ventura Freeway, the report considered only aerial and subway 
configurations, finding that trains could not be operated at ground level along 
the freeway except for a short span in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how much of the freeway line is underground, the cost would be 
between $2.2 billion and $3.5 billion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Chandler-Victory route, a ground-level system would disturb 38 homes 
with noise and have a visual impact on 30 houses, while a subway would not 
disturb any houses, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said a freeway line would displace up to 500 houses, as many as 133 
businesses and up to 43 acres of parkland, while the Chandler-Victory route 
would require condemnation of as many as 113 businesses and the loss of up to 
29 acres of park but would not take any houses. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, noting that 499 houses would be condemned for a freeway rail line, said: 
"I don't think any elected official in his right mind would pick a route that 
requires taking 500 houses, so the freeway route looks like it won't go." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the freeway route has never had many supporters and, in addition, 
homeowners along the freeway are well-organized and vehemently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The Chandler-Victory route, though long favored by rail planners because the 
right of way is available, was strongly opposed by most homeowner groups until 
Robbins and Braude devised their North Hollywood-to-Sepulveda Basin plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Robbins-Braude compromise, businesses gave up their goal of an 
immediate rail link to fast-growing Warner Center while homeowner leaders 
agreed to accept the dust and noise that would accompany tunneling through 
single-family neighborhoods in North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Encino homeowner leader Gerald A. Silver, who represents a dwindling group of 
activists opposed to any rail plan, said the report released Wednesday shows 
that "rail in the Valley would be a boondoggle" and would have a "horribly 
devastating effect on the complexion and habitability of the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that ridership projections would not be met and that "cost 
overruns would exceed our worst nightmares."

OVERFLOW CROWD JAMS HEARING ON WESTLAKE VILLAGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 people jammed a public hearing Wednesday before the Westlake 
Village City Council, which was considering a controversial residential and 
commercial project known as Westlake North. 
</P>
<P>
The council had not made a decision by late Wednesday. Because of the large 
number of people wishing to speak, Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier said he expected 
to continue the hearing at 7 p.m. today at Westlake Village City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people filled the council chambers, forcing officials to seat 100 
more in an adjacent community center where the proceedings were shown on cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal involves 129 acres north of the Ventura Freeway and east of 
Lindero Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by Daniel K. Ludwig, at first proposed 
1.5 million square feet of commercial space and 400 condominiums. After several 
months of controversy over the project's size, the residential portion of the 
project was reduced to 250 dwelling units, and this week Westlake Village 
Associates proposed to reduce the commercial area by 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction brought the commercial square footage into accord with the city's 
general plan and prompted hope by council members that the developer would 
reduce his requested height limit of five stories. But under questioning by 
council members at Wednesday's hearing, Westlake Village Associates 
representative Charles H. Fry said the firm would continue to ask for five 
stories. Fry noted that his company had originally sought six stories.

MOORPARK'S MAYORAL SELECTION SYSTEM ENDS WITH BITTER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a routine and somewhat wistful event -- the last time the 
Moorpark City Council would select a mayor from among its five members. But 
instead the municipal ritual went out with a bang, angering and delighting an 
audience of approximately 75 citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Paul Lawrason, a 61-year-old contracts director for a small 
aerospace firm, was chosen the eighth mayor in the city's six-year history by a 
3-2 vote, but not until there had been a bitter fight against his colleague 
Bernardo Perez and a raucous 15-minute recess to give the participants a chance 
to collect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark voters last year overwhelmingly adopted an initiative enabling them to 
elect their mayor rather than having the five council members choose the mayor 
from among themselves. The ballot measure grew out of a city scandal in which 
one councilman was forced to resign and the mayor was recalled amid 
never-proven allegations of kickbacks from a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night marked the last time the council would select a mayor -- a 
largely ceremonial post, because the 25,000-resident city employs a full-time 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a 40-year-old employee of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
and the council's mayor pro tem, wanted to be the last chosen mayor. He was 
nominated by Councilman Clint Harper, as expected, but in a turn of events that 
appeared to catch Perez off guard, Councilman Scott Montgomery proposed that 
the position be rotated during the coming term. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery proposed rotating the mayor's job among himself, Perez and Lawrason, 
who were all elected last year and have not yet had a chance to serve as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who appeared nonplussed, said he would refuse to participate in such a 
plan. At that point, Montgomery nominated Lawrason. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's supporter Harper said, "We don't contribute to the community by making 
Moorpark appear to its residents and to other cities to be a bit of a political 
circus. What we're doing tonight is introducing personal feelings when they 
shouldn't be there. In other communities, this would be virtually automatic." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery was elected mayor pro tem after Perez refused the nomination.

COUNCIL REVISITS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council reaffirmed its approval of a large commercial office project 
at Santa Monica Municipal Airport, but added a provision that would strike it 
down if a referendum opposing the project is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a citizens group submitted nearly 9,000 signatures against the 
project to the city clerk. If at least 5,644 signatures are verified by the 
county registrar, the City Council would be forced to reverse its decision or 
place the matter on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents repeated their opposition to the 822,000-square-foot project. 
One resident said: "The people overwhelmingly gave their choice" against the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane, an avid supporter of the project, said it is needed because 
of the revenue it would provide the city, and vowed to vigorously campaign for 
it, if the matter is placed on the ballot.

CITY HALTS HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council halted a mid-city condominium project after neighborhood 
residents raised concerns over the proposed removal of two pre-1930 bungalows 
from the site. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-3 vote overturned the Planning Commission's approval of the project, 
which the city staff had recommended because it met all city requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But the council was swayed by a small turnout of residents who contended that 
the bungalows were historic structures that should be preserved and that the 
new project was not compatible with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Landmarks Commission, however, voted 4 to 3 last week not to 
designate the project's area a historic district and 7 to 0 that the structures 
were not landmarks. Approval of either category by the commission would have 
also halted the three-story condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
A community group called Mid-City Neighbors presented the council with almost 
300 signatures opposing the condominium project, planned for 1253 11th St. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Syd Jurin said the project would cause a "domino effect." Residents 
"feel other landlords will follow this example and build more condominiums and 
force out the families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ken Genser, however, warned that the council's rejection of the 
project is open to legal challenge because the project meets zoning 
requirements. He proposed a moratorium on construction that would remove or 
destroy a structure that could be historic. "We should delay this project so 
that it will get caught up in that moratorium," he said.

TEACHER GROUPS ASSAIL CULVER CITY PAY PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for Culver City teachers have reached a new agreement on salary and 
benefits with the Culver City Unified School District, but leaders of the two 
teachers groups that spearheaded last month's defeat of a tentative contract 
say the new proposal is still not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The new tentative one-year contract, announced Tuesday by the Culver City 
Teachers Assn., calls for a 7% pay raise and an 8% increase in school district 
contributions to fee-for-service health plan premiums, according to association 
President Bess Doerr. The contract rejected in October contained increases of 
6% and 7%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good agreement," said Doerr. "I think we got everything we're 
could get." 
</P>
<P>
But David Mielke, president of the rival Culver City Federation of Teachers, 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged, but I don't think it's the best we can do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mielke, whose union was ousted last year as bargaining representative by the 
Culver City Teachers Assn., said that because the district made some 
concessions with little pressure from the community or teachers, he wants to 
see what happens if teachers start speaking up at school board meetings or 
walking picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
"My instinct tells me that if you can move them without pressure, you can move 
them more with pressure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Los Angeles teachers strike in May and the recently concluded 
strike in Beverly Hills, Mielke said: "This is the year where there's a real 
heightened awareness of teachers' salaries. . . . This is the year to bring 
that pressure to the board." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Bennett, chairman of School Employees Assn. for Lifetime Health 
Coverage, had harsher words for the proposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible, it's just bad," said Bennett, an English teacher who for the 
last two years has waged a boisterous campaign to win full health coverage for 
present and future retired teachers. "I call on every voting member to vote no 
on it. Let the (union) go back and do better." 
</P>
<P>
Eliminated from the revised agreement was a provision that capped the amount of 
money the district paid for health insurance for retirees between 55 and 65, 
Doerr said. Retirees are currently provided full coverage for those 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old contract, retirees 65 and older have no health coverage at all -- 
not even Medicare -- unless they were enrolled in the Social Security system in 
another job. An apparent consensus has emerged among the various teacher 
factions and district officials that the new contract needs to provide some 
health coverage for these retirees, although there continues to be disagreement 
over how to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The district agrees in the new tentative contract, as it did in the rejected 
one, to take advantage of a new state law that, starting next year, will give 
teachers the option of buying into Medicare, a benefit from which California 
teachers were excluded before 1987. The district would split the cost -- 2.9% 
of annual salary -- of entering the system and also provide $1,250 a year for a 
Medicare supplement for retirees 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposed contract, the district will postpone from Jan. 1 to July 
1 the date it will allow teachers to enter the Medicare system, according to 
Assistant Supt. Ralph R. Villani. The money saved from the postponement will 
cover the increased salaries and health benefits. Each raise of one percentage 
point in salary costs the district about $100,000, Villani said. 
</P>
<P>
The first tentative contract was defeated on Oct. 10, 111 to 86. Doerr of the 
teachers association said several factors contributed to the defeat: high 
expectations brought on by the 8% raise striking Los Angeles teachers won 
earlier this year; the continuing political battle between the rival Culver 
City teacher organizations, and the vocal opposition to the contract from 
Bennett and his allies, who are seeking comprehensive lifetime health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett maintains that the coverage provided by Medicare and a supplement is 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr, however, said that although Medicare and a supplemental plan may not be 
the perfect lifetime health benefits, "they're four giant steps forward." 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she expects the new proposal to be criticized, several 
teachers told her after the last vote that all they wanted was "just a little 
more money," and she thinks that it will pass when it is voted on later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Others did not share Doerr's satisfaction with the district's latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ruebsamen, a history teacher at Culver City High School, said that he and 
many of his colleagues are waiting for Doerr's group to come through with the 
10% raises and lifetime health coverage it promised during its campaign to 
decertify the rival federation as bargaining representative. 
</P>
<P>
And pointing to Los Angeles as an example, Ruebsamen said he's not ready to let 
the district off the hook when it pleads financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
"Other districts that have suffered the same financial crunch have made the 
adjustments," he said. "This district has not. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Ruebsamen said the morale in the district is the lowest he's seen since he 
started 17 years ago. Administrators and teachers "used to talk about keeping a 
positive teaching environment. We were a family. Now, I think there's an 
attitude of it's us against them." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about morale in the district, Villani said he thinks that morale in 
the profession as a whole is low. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said: "Whenever there's negotiations going on, a favorite thing for 
teachers to say is that their morale is low," he said. "I'd like to see 
teachers get paid more. We're not getting paid what we should, but what can the 
board do? We have a limited budget." 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said the district's 280 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians will 
most likely vote on the proposed contract the week after Thanksgiving.

W. HOLLYWOOD TO ALLOW APARTMENT CONVERSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING: COUNCIL SAYS HOTELIER CAN CONVERT HIS BUILDINGS TO HOTELS IF HE PAYS 
$4.9 MILLION OVER 20 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After softening a series of strict conditions imposed by a city commission, the 
West Hollywood City Council voted Monday to allow hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy to 
proceed with a plan to convert several apartment buildings to hotels in 
exchange for $4.9 million paid to the city over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials said Ashkenazy is likely to accept the compromise 
agreement in the long-running dispute, not everybody was happy to see the 
restrictions loosened. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the City Council thinks with a happy, warm feeling that they went 
along with the Planning Commission. Unfortunately, they did not go along with 
the spirit of the whole thing the Planning Commission had done," said Jeanne 
Dobrin, an opponent of the hotel agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Abbe Land said the restrictions will protect the surrounding 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together very hard to try and address the many concerns we heard. We 
did try and incorporate the planning commission recommendations," Land said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between the city and financially troubled Ashkenazy 
Enterprises Inc. last December would allow the company to convert the buildings 
to hotels in exchange for the payments, including $1.2 million in delinquent 
hotel occupancy taxes and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
In June and July, the city Planning Commission substantially restricted the 
proposed conversions after irate neighbors denounced the agreements as a 
sellout by the city and complained that the hotels would be an unwanted 
commercial intrusion into residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission denied liquor permits to the proposed hotels, imposed 
restrictions on parking, delivery traffic, noise, and the hours and types of 
parties that would be allowed at the hotels. The commission also denied plans 
to add on to Ashkenazy's Bel Age hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council overturned the commission's severe restrictions, 
allowing a liquor permit at one site and partial liquor permits at two others. 
Among the new conditions, the council agreed to limit the number of people 
allowed at hotel parties to 50, make it illegal for tour buses to park with 
engines running at the hotels and mandated that there be adequate free parking 
for hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Koretz, the only member to consistently oppose the plans 
Monday, criticized the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not completely satisfied. While Ashkenazy is not the ogre many have 
portrayed him as, he has not been a particularly good neighbor," Koretz said. 
"The council obviously chose to give him his settlement. . . . It worked to 
Ashkenazy's convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Dobrin, who led an estimated 40 speakers opposed to the hotel plan at Monday's 
public hearing, said public pressure was not wholly unsuccessful, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We did win a lot of points," Dobrin said. She said opponents may consider 
future steps but had not yet made any decisions.

TRAILER PARK PROPOSAL HITS OPPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL SIDES WITH RESIDENTS. THEY DON'T WANT 
APARTMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS BUILT ON ONE OF THE LAST MOBILE HOME PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Residents of one of the last trailer parks in Santa Monica were jubilant when 
the City Council unanimously spoke out Tuesday against a developer's plans to 
build condominiums and apartments on the five-acre park site. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 residents of the Mountain View Mobile Inn trailer park picketed in 
front of City Hall before the council meeting, carrying signs that read: "I 
just say no to Watt (Industries)." 
</P>
<P>
In a heated meeting two weeks ago, residents were stunned by the news that the 
141-space park would make way for multifamily housing. The park is owned by 
Ramona Treffinger, but Watt has taken an option to purchase the property. 
</P>
<P>
Watt officials assured park residents that they would be offered new 
apartments, but those attending the meeting were dissatisfied with answers that 
one woman called "noncommittal and evasive." 
</P>
<P>
Watt has a number of hurdles to negotiate before going forward with its plans. 
Mountain View is zoned for mobile homes and would have to be rezoned to allow 
condominiums and apartments to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mountain View residents, fearing changes such as those Watt has 
proposed, persuaded the City Council to rezone the park from light industrial 
to residential/mobile homes, a designation that allows only mobile homes, 
trailers, yard sales and small family day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the park is under rent control. If the city Rent Control Board 
grants the developer a permit to change the park units, Watt would have to 
replace the rent-controlled units and provide relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, Phyllis Goff, representing the residents, spoke 
out against Watt's plans and asked the council to make its stand on the issue 
known. 
</P>
<P>
All the council members said they were against rezoning the park. Councilman 
Herbert Katz said that when Watt representatives told him of their proposal, he 
told them: "If you're into pain, go ahead and waste your time." 
</P>
<P>
Rent Control Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis said the developer made a 
"fatal mistake" in setting eyes on rent-controlled property. She added that 
approval would be granted "over our dead bodies" and accused Watt of misleading 
residents by "claiming that (the project) was going to happen and the tenants 
better make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Maller, a spokeswoman and public relations consultant for Watt, said the 
developer did not care to comment on the council's statements. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Maller said Watt had not applied for the necessary 
zoning change. She said such a move would be premature until Watt had talked 
with residents individually to determine how much rent they could afford and 
their needs and ideas for new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Maller said all the park's current residents would be able to afford the new 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make it affordable, what's the point of doing it?" she said. "It 
is our hope that we would be able to put condos and affordable housing that 
would be superior to what's there now." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the residents were not satisfied with those assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved out of an apartment because the rents were going up," said Barbara 
Kessel, who lives in one of the park's 141 units with her daughter and 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the mobile home "a place of my own," she said: "It was putting me into 
a financial situation that could put me in an early retirement, which would be 
totally impossible for me to do if they displace me. You're dealing with not 
only tearing down rentals but taking away people's own homes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Maller said the company will consider compensating residents for 
losing the homes they own, park residents doubt that the compensation would 
equal the values of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
And despite Watt's promises that they would get superior housing, most are not 
convinced that apartments would provide the quiet and almost crime-free 
environment of the trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Donna Satterfield said she and others are ready to fight a "David and 
Goliath" battle. 
</P>
<P>
Watt "wanted us to see this as an opportunity where everybody could benefit," 
Satterfield said. "But we don't see it that way. They acted as if there were 
nothing more to be said. We felt like the steamroller was rolling over us, and 
there wasn't anything we could do to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Evans has lived in a trailer park for 42 years. She survived the Santa 
Monica Freeway construction that slashed Mountain View to one-third its 
original size. But now, Evans said, she may be facing life on the streets or in 
an "old ladies' home" if Watt is allowed to go through with its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, like other longtime residents of Mountain View, is retired and lives 
alone. Her only income is Social Security, from which she pays about $200 a 
month for rent and utilities. In recent years, however, college students and 
families have moved into the park, taking advantage of the low rent. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of people I know here who don't have anything compared 
with what I have," Evans said. She added that her health -- she has bad legs -- 
would make getting around an apartment difficult.

CONSTRUCTION CURBS OKD FOR PICO-ROBERTSON AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apartment and condominium projects in a 15-block neighborhood near the 
intersection of Pico and Robertson boulevards will be required to provide 
deeper front yards and additional landscaping under temporary building 
restrictions approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, proposed by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky because of complaints 
about a surge in building, are intended to prevent new projects from 
overwhelming duplexes and small apartments that make up the core of the 
neighborhood. The restrictions limit most construction to three stories and 
require developers of taller buildings to set back upper floors at least 10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"They are designed to improve the aesthetic quality of development and make it 
compatible in scale and mass with the existing units," said Vivian Rescalvo, 
planning deputy to Yaroslavsky. "People were just tired of seeing these 
buildings go in with no front yards and no landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions require developers to provide 20-foot-deep front yards, five 
feet deeper than normal. They also require a minimum of 100 square feet of open 
space for each dwelling unit and at least one tree for every three dwelling 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Bertram, an official of the Crestview Neighborhood Assn., which first 
asked for building curbs in January, said the group welcomed the restrictions 
but had hoped they would be tougher. The association, for example, asked for a 
25-foot front-yard setback, but the Planning Commission opted for 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extraordinarily discouraged before the Planning Commission," said 
Bertram, secretary for the 750-household association, which represents renters 
and homeowners south of the affected area. "But we are pleased that at least 
there is something." 
</P>
<P>
Rescalvo said 20 new projects have been proposed this year for the 
neighborhood, which is bounded by Pickford Street and La Cienega Boulevard in 
addition to Pico and Robertson. In June, the council imposed similar 
restrictions in an adjacent neighborhood north of Pico and south of the Beverly 
Hills city line, where old apartment buildings were being demolished for 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The new limits will be in effect for at least one year while planning officials 
draft permanent guidelines for the two neighborhoods. Rescalvo said she expects 
those guidelines in large part to mirror the temporary ones.

SABERHAGEN AL CY YOUNG AWARD PICK; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: KANSAS CITY PITCHER, A TWO-TIME WINNER, IS THE OVERWHELMING CHOICE OF 
VOTERS. OAKLAND'S DAVE STEWART IS RUNNER-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas City Royal pitcher Bret Saberhagen won 20 of his last 22 games this 
season, and that fast finish culminated Wednesday in his second American League 
Cy Young Award in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, a right-hander who went 23-6, got 27 of 28 first-place votes and 
one second-place vote -- for 138 points -- from a panel of the Baseball Writers 
Assn. of America. Oakland's Dave Stewart, the most valuable player of the World 
Series, got the other first-place vote, 24 seconds and three thirds for 80 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore of the Athletics was third with 10 points, followed by Bert Blyleven 
of the Angels with nine and Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers with five. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, 25, who also won the award in 1985, led the majors in victories, 
earned-run average (2.16), winning percentage (.793), complete games (12) and 
innings pitched (262 1/3). He pitched four shutouts, three three-hitters and 
two four-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the curveball of a lifetime this year," Royal Manager John Wathan told 
the Associated Press. "He was consistent from opening day. I was not surprised 
he won by an overwhelming margin. Dave Stewart is a great pitcher, but 
everybody knows who the most consistent pitcher in the major leagues was this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, of Reseda, was on a cruise to Mexico with his wife, Janeane, 
Wednesday when the award was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine pitching much better," he said by conference call from a boat 
at Puerto Vallarta. "I don't think I would have won it without great support. 
They seemed always to score just enough runs for me." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen's father, Bob, who lives in an area of southwest Ventura County 
known as Box Canyon, said: "It just amazes me. Here he is only 25 years old and 
look at what he's accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"Two-time Cy Young Award winner. World Series MVP (in 1985). Comeback player of 
the year in 1987. Runner-up for comeback player this year, although I wonder 
what he was coming back from." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen was 14-16 with a 3.80 ERA in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm proud of him," Bob Saberhagen said. "I mean, when I stop to 
think about it, it really moves me. Guys play their whole lives and don't have 
these kinds of careers." 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing about Bret is, I'd be proud of him if he were slinging 
hamburgers. He's really a good kid. 
</P>
<P>
"Bret and I were playing golf the other day and he was talking about his life 
after baseball. I reminded him he could be pitching 20 more years." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who will earn $1.4 million next season, will get a $100,000 bonus 
for winning the award. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals recently picked up the option year (1990) on Saberhagen's three-year 
contract, and the Royals and agent Dennis Gilbert are working on a multiyear 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals were 29-6 in his starts last season, and he beat every club in the 
league at least once. He allowed eight runs in his last 80 innings and had a 
streak of 31 innings without an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed more than three earned runs just three times in 35 starts and not 
once in his final 14. In his six losses, the Royals were shut out three times 
and scored one run twice. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen is 92-61 in six seasons with Kansas City. He was 20-6 in 1985, then 
went on to pitch two complete games as the Royals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
As a standout at Cleveland High School in Reseda, he pitched a no-hitter in the 
1982 City championship game to beat Palisades, 13-0. He missed a perfect game 
when the second batter reached base on an error. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen's no-hitter was the first in Los Angeles City baseball playoff 
history. 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year, Saberhagen was 9-0 with an 0.85 ERA. He also batted .362 
and played shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his credentials, Saberhagen was not drafted until the 19th round of the 
1982 June free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
He spent 1983 in the minor leagues and joined the Royals in 1984. He was a 
10-11 was a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Then came his big year in 1985 in which he was 20-6. And the next year, when he 
was 7-12 and criticized for cashing in on the 1985 success instead of preparing 
for the next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was awful young," he said from Puerto Vallarta. "I didn't know much about 
success. I tried to do too much. Hopefully, next year I'll be just as steady. I 
know what it takes to get ready for a season and I'm going to do it. In '86, I 
thought I should strike out every batter." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen joins Denny McLain (1968-69), Jim Palmer (1973-75-76) and Roger 
Clemens (1986-87) as pitchers who have won the AL award more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen had the lowest ERA for an AL winner since Palmer had a 2.09 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart failed to get the award despite winning 20 games for a third 
consecutive season. He was 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Stewart was 21-12 and was the AL Cy Young Award runner-up to Frank 
Viola, then of the Minnesota Twins. Stewart was 20-13 in 1987 and lost to Roger 
Clemens of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Stewart put together three great years," Saberhagen said. "I'm just glad 
that the writers voted on this particular year." 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: THIS WAY, MAYBE THEY HAVE FIGHTING CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't think it to look at him -- or study his record -- but Mike Garrett 
says there was a guy in the old neighborhood twice as good as he was. 
</P>
<P>
Now we're talking here about a guy who won USC's first Heisman, ran for 3,221 
yards and 30 touchdowns in his college career and led the Kansas City Chiefs to 
two Super Bowls in his professional career. We're talking super runner, super 
athlete. Hall of Fame stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mike was growing up, there was this other guy who was not only better, 
he was bigger, faster, stronger. He was Mike's idol is what he was. Mike used 
to go see him play all the time when he was a kid. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened to this all-star? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's a long, sad but familiar story. First, gangs. Then, drugs, booze, 
the fast lane, the easy way. It all ended in blood and death on the highway in 
his 30th year. A waste. 
</P>
<P>
Mike got a real close-up view of it. His idol was his brother John. 
</P>
<P>
The sequel is equally depressing. 
</P>
<P>
Only the other day, in the Aliso projects, the story came out about another 
innocent victim of a drive-by gang shooting. A young, pregnant woman left her 
apartment to visit a friend. There was a crash of gunfire. She was in the 
middle of it. The young mother and unborn child were instantly slain. 
</P>
<P>
She was John's daughter, carrying his grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
The violence is rolling down the generations. The new slaughter of the 
innocents. It is senseless carnage. 
</P>
<P>
You go out for a loaf of bread, you end up with a sheet on your head and a tag 
on your toe. It is worse than war. In a war, you get a helmet and a gun. You 
know the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Here, you are just a target. You don't even get a blindfold and a last 
cigarette. You don't even get to say goodby. No man's land has traffic lights 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
Our young have become more dangerous than the animals in the field. Lions are 
in the streets. The pioneers could at least circle the wagons. We can only put 
bars on the windows. Or move to Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
The headlines are terrifying: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "High School Football Turns to Fear Amid Gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Drive-by Shotgun Blast Wounds 5 in Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
The city as hostage. Football games that once drew sellouts, 7,000 or more, 
play to a corporal's guard. We are afraid of our young. "The Lord of the Flies" 
has come true. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Garrett is as heartsick as the rest of the community. He has lost a 
brother and now a niece and grandniece to the madness. He yearns to do 
something about it. Somebody has to. It's high noon on Main Street, USA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only 5% of the population," mourns Mike. "Unfortunately, it's the 5% with 
the guns. Ninety-five percent of the kids are good, law-abiding, studious." 
</P>
<P>
It is a truism of our society that 5% outnumber 95% if the 5% is armed and 
dangerous. Just ask the Germans. A minority plus a Luger equals a dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"We belonged to gangs when I was a kid in East L.A., too," admits Garrett. "But 
when we had disagreements, we duked it out. These kids today are cowards. They 
kill from behind hedges, from passing cars. They're really afraid to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a sissy would carry a knife when we were growing up. You wouldn't shoot a 
guy through a car window where you might hit a baby carriage. You'd go up and 
say, 'Hey! I hear you're looking for me. Well, here I am! What are you going to 
do about it?' 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are the alienated ones. They're not good at athletics. And they're 
not good at schoolwork. They can't read. And they can't play. So they put this 
headband around their heads and they say 'Hey! I'm somebody! I'm a Crip!' 
They've got their identity, and God help society. Society is scared to death of 
them. The problem in East L.A. is territorial. The problem in South Central is 
drug-related. The problem everywhere is communication." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to see a punch in the jaw as a method of meaningful communication, 
but Mike Garrett thinks it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" he says. "You don't bring a switch-blade knife or an Uzi into the ring 
with you. You just bring the things God gave you. You bring courage, speed, 
intelligence. You learn respect for an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times do you see two guys whomp each other all night long, then fall 
into each others' arms when the bell rings? Prizefighters are usually God's 
humblest creatures. They know somebody is just as tough as they are and they 
have the lumps to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do is refocus some of this energy, re-prioritize their 
directions. We want them to work out this aggression in more socially 
acceptable ways -- in the gym. We want them to learn to like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem of the ghetto is low self-esteem, the need to be part of a 
group. You know, we had gangs. But I formed some fast friendships with my 
fists. Even when I lost. Maybe especially when I lost." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, holder of a law degree, graduate in sociology, does not hold that 
pugilism is the answer to all society's ills. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's better than militarism," he says. "You're not talking about kids here 
who would go join the glee club or try out for the school operetta or go pick 
strawberries. We're not talking about candidates for the debating society. 
These guys don't handle group settings very well. You have to deal with what 
they do handle well." 
</P>
<P>
With that in view, Garrett, as director of Forum boxing for Jerry Buss, and 
with Buss' blessing, is forming a partnership with the Ramona Gardens Civil 
Youth Authority and Gang Violence Reduction Program whereby, at Mike's behest, 
50% of the proceeds of the World Boxing Assn.'s Dec. 11 junior-featherweight 
title fight between Juan Jose (Dinamita) Estrada and Jesus Salud will go to 
youth work in the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the whole answer, it's a start," Mike concedes. "It's got to start 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The Garrett family has suffered enough from gang violence. So has the 
community. Unless something is done, L.A. is going to end up getting shot 
through the heart -- from a car window.

IT'S BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY, JAPANESE STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: VACATION TO THE YOMIURI GIANTS IS A BIT LIKE WINTER LEAGUE, COMPLETE 
WITH U.S. COACHING ADVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only two weeks after winning the World Series of Japan, the Yomiuri Giants have 
come to this resort mecca for a little R and R. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in the case of the Giants, with their commitment to the Japanese 
work ethic, R and R is defined as Review and Refinement. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Norihiro Komada, the most valuable player in the Japanese World 
Series, is seeking to improve his discipline at the plate, hoping to hit more 
than his 11 home runs of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Tatsunori Hara, a .300 hitter who usually hits 30 home runs and 
drives in more than 90 runs a year, is hoping to correct flaws that reduced his 
1989 average to .261 and lowered his home run total to 24. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive winter, the Giants have gone to the considerable 
expense of flying 31 players and their coaching staff to Palm Springs for two 
weeks of specialized instruction at the Angels' spring facility with an 
American coaching staff that includes Don Drysdale, Jim Fregosi, Don Baylor, 
Ron Fairly, Claude Osteen, Del Crandall, Mark Cresse of the Dodgers, Jim Bush, 
the former UCLA track coach and now a conditioning coach with the Dodgers, and 
Todd Maulding, a Dodger batting practice and bullpen aide. 
</P>
<P>
Is Drysdale impressed? 
</P>
<P>
"If American kids listened and had the discipline that these players do, 
there's no telling how good our game would be," he said. "Their mechanics and 
regimentation are outstanding. You only have to tell them something once. They 
want to learn." 
</P>
<P>
The camp is a spinoff of discussions three years ago at a golf tournament 
between former American and Japanese baseball players at Mission Hills here. 
</P>
<P>
Among the participants were Drysdale and a close friend, Tatsuro Hirooko, who 
have since become president and vice president, respectively, of Japan Sports 
System USA, which owns the Visalia club in the California League, where four of 
the Giants' minor leaguers played this year. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal, Drysdale said, is a global World Series. In fact, as part of 
an ongoing JSS USA project, he left the Palm Springs camp the other day to 
attend what he called a U.S.-Japanese summit seminar on baseball relations and 
operations in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Is the world ready? Would the Yomiuri Giants have provided more competition for 
the Oakland Athletics than the San Francisco Giants did in the World Series, 
which the A's won in four games? 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference between this team and the A's would be power and a little 
speed," Drysdale said, giving the A's an edge in those two categories but 
calling the pitching a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when everything the Japanese threw was finesse and sidearm," 
Drysdale added. "They're getting bigger now. They have kids here who throw in 
the 90s." 
</P>
<P>
Said Osteen, the former Dodger left-hander who works in the club's farm system: 
</P>
<P>
"From a pitching standpoint, this team can probably put just as good an arm out 
there every day as Oakland can. 
</P>
<P>
"And (the Yomiuri pitchers) research the hell out of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a purpose for every pitch. It's beautiful to watch the pitcher and 
catcher work together. There's no lack of communication. And I've seen enough 
to know they seldom beat themselves." 
</P>
<P>
For Fairly and Baylor, working with the Giant hitters, the task is more 
formidable. Fairly, a 21-year major leaguer who is a member of the San 
Francisco Giant broadcasting team, leaned on the batting cage and cited the 
similarity of the stances and swings, the absence of individualism. 
</P>
<P>
"They get to the ball in better position to hit it than our players do, but 
they don't finish the swing," he said, suggesting that they are only trying to 
make contact. 
</P>
<P>
"They're paid on the basis of batting average and booed if they strike out. You 
can't blame them for wanting to go three for four. Our players strike out, 
strike out, then hit a three-run homer. The philosophy is different. I don't 
mean to say that we're trying to make home run hitters out of these guys 
because we're not. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're stronger than they've demonstrated, and we're trying to get them 
to attack, to hit it harder, so that their ground balls have a chance to get 
through the infield and the ball in the gap has a chance to get through the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"They pick it up quickly, but I don't know how long it will stay with them. In 
the back of their minds, I don't think they want to swing and miss." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants will put their new techniques to work Feb. 1, when they begin spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Their coach, Akihito Kondoh, speaking through an interpreter, cited the demands 
of a training regimen that continues throughout a 130-game season and said the 
current camp was a chance to unwind and learn at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many requests for the players after the World Series that it is 
good to get away," Kondoh said. "Beautiful weather. Train a little and play 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much relaxation here." 
</P>
<P>
R and R. The Yomiuri Giants define it in many ways.

HIGHLY REGARDED ODOM TO REDSHIRT FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Odom, the tallest but least advanced of UCLA's highly regarded freshmen 
recruiting class of 1989, will sit out this season as a redshirt, Coach Jim 
Harrick said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little blue," Odom said Wednesday night before the Bruins' 102-89 
exhibition victory over Athletes in Action. "I think it might be best for me, 
but I have to be disappointed because I worked all my life to come in here and 
play as a freshman and start as a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
Returning starter Kevin Walker and former walk-on Keith Owens will share the 
center position for UCLA, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I recruited Rodney, I didn't plan on the emergence of Keith Owens as a 
(regular) player for us," he said. "I just don't think I have enough minutes 
(for Odom) at the forward and center spots and I don't want to waste a year on 
a kid as talented and as skilled as Rodney Odom." 
</P>
<P>
Odom hasn't played as well as he thought he would after averaging 20 points and 
11 rebounds last season at Kingwood (Tex.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played as many games as most people on the team," said the 
6-foot-11, 215-pound Odom. "In (Texas), we could only play 20 games in the 
summer. In California, they can play an unlimited number of games. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to put on 15 or 20 pounds, get a little stronger and next year, 
hopefully, I'll be fighting for a starting spot." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick said before the game that freshman Mitchell Butler was 
pushing sophomore Gerald Madkins in the battle for the starting off-guard spot. 
Madkins responded with nine points and seven assists in 30 minutes. Butler 
scored seven points in 13 minutes. "Gerald's experience is the thing that's put 
him over the hump right now," Harrick said. . . . Don MacLean made 11 of 19 
shots and led the Bruins with 25 points and nine rebounds. Trevor Wilson had 20 
points and six rebounds, Darrick Martin had 14 points and four assists and 
Kevin Walker had 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. . . . Freshman Tracy 
Murray made only four of 13 shots, scoring nine points in 13 minutes. . . . 
Said Harrick: "We're probably a lot farther along than we were a year ago. It's 
easier to teach four (new) guys than it was to teach a whole squad of guys." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Zimmerman, a 6-10 forward from Colorado Springs, Colo., who signed with 
UCLA this week after visiting Arizona, Georgia Tech, Providence and Kansas, 
said of his decision: "It came down basically to location, the academics and 
the business opportunities after college because I want to stay there in 
California." . . . Harrick told the Colorado Springs Gazette: "We only offered 
two scholarships in the fall, and one of them went to Rodney." The other was 
offered to Shon Tarver, a 6-4 guard from Santa Clara High in Oxnard. Tarver did 
not commit during the early signing period, which ended Tuesday at midnight. . 
. . UCLA plays the Australian national team Tuesday night before opening the 
regular season against Santa Clara Nov. 25 at Pauley Pavilion.

Roy Tarpley of the Dallas Mavericks was charged Wednesday night with driving 
while intoxicated and resisting arrest during a traffic stop by police on a 
Dallas freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Frank Ruspoli said Tarpley, who has been suspended twice by the NBA 
for cocaine abuse, was arrested at 10:38 p.m. Wednesday in north Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Ruspoli said Tarpley also was arrested on other traffic charges, including an 
improper lane change and failure to have his driver's license and proof of 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
A positive test for alcohol would not necessarily be the "third strike" that 
would result in a minimum two-year suspension from the NBA.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
OPENING DAY ATTRACTS ONLY 11,729 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As a result of recent renovation, new bricks and fresh paint were much in 
evidence for the start of Hollywood Park's 30-day fall-winter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the track, people were in shorter supply. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a distressing trend for the Inglewood plant, only 11,729 fans showed 
up Wednesday, making it the smallest opening-day gathering in Hollywood Park 
history. The previous low was last year, when 14,980 turned out on a day when 
there was a promotional giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
This does not bode well for the remainder of the meeting, which concludes 
Christmas Eve and follows an Oak Tree meeting that had only small declines in 
on-track attendance and handle. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Boulanger, however, found absolutely nothing wrong with his first day at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The recently arrived jockey scored his first stakes victory in Southern 
California when he rode Owiseone to an upset in the $75,825 Moccasin Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The longest shot at 5-1 in a field reduced to four after four scratches, the 
2-year-old Smarten filly defeated 6-5 favorite Ten K by 1 1/2 lengths while 
covering the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:16 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third consecutive win for Owiseone, purchased for $60,000 by 
trainer Terry Knight after she broke her maiden for $32,000 on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
In her initial start for Knight, Owiseone beat a Bay Meadows allowance field by 
nine lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Never far off the lead Wednesday, she moved ahead and drew clear in the final 
sixteenth to make it two for two with Boulanger aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Ten K, making her first start since being beaten by 17 lengths at 1-1 odds in 
the Del Mar Debutante, outfinished Dramatic Joy by a neck for second place. 
Bel's Starlet, who seemed unusually washy going to the gate, was last, another 
half-length back. A Wild Ride was scratched earlier in the afternoon, and 
Puppet Show, Nasers Pride and Interlope opted instead for an allowance race on 
today's program. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just real impressed with the way she broke her maiden," Knight said of 
Owiseone. "She didn't beat a lot, but she did it like a real seasoned horse 
that had a big future. 
</P>
<P>
"After we got her and started training her, we thought we had a nice prospect. 
She beat nobody in her first race for us, but she won as easy as a horse can. 
It really was what we were looking for because she'd been off almost two months 
after her maiden win, and we didn't want to have a race that was too tough on 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got good natural, tactical speed and a good finish, as you saw today. 
They were all right together at the quarter-pole, and she outfinished them." 
</P>
<P>
Since making his local debut on Breeders' Cup day at Santa Anita, Boulanger has 
shown he belongs on this circuit, and it helps that his agent is Jerry Ingordo, 
Pat Valenzuela's longtime partner. 
</P>
<P>
The top rider at Longacres in Renton, Wash., last spring, Boulanger, who will 
turn 22 Sunday, had won 16 races in 17 days at Bay Meadows before Ingordo 
persuaded him to move again. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels fabulous, to say the least," he said after his first added-money 
success. "Everyone has been very responsive from the stables we've approached 
to giving us a shot. I have to give 90% of the credit to Jerry. He has a lot of 
connections, and I'm just the kid who goes out and works." 
</P>
<P>
Because he was able to work with an agent of Ingordo's longevity, Boulanger 
decided the time was right to try to compete with such riders as Eddie 
Delahoussaye, Chris McCarron, Gary Stevens and Laffit Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
"I had thought about coming here, but when I did I wanted to come in with an 
agent with a lot of power and a lot of pull," he said. "It was tough to leave 
(Bay Meadows) because we were on a really good roll and business was looking 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"But I came at a very opportune time with everybody out of town for the 
Breeders' Cup, and I was able to get into a number of barns a lot sooner." 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian, Boulanger didn't begin riding until he was almost 18 and he is 
well-traveled. Besides Washington, he has also ridden in Canada, Florida, 
Delaware, Ohio and New York. 
</P>
<P>
After Owiseone's romp up north last month, Boulanger felt confident about her 
chances in the Moccasin. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd done everything asked of her, and the only thing we were concerned about 
was the shipping," he said. "She's a 2-year-old and it was her first time on 
(this) track, but she did everything perfect." 
</P>
<P>
According to Knight, Owiseone will return to Bay Meadows, but the $500,000 
Hollywood Starlet at a mile on Dec. 3 is a definite consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens had no excuses for Ten K, who looked ready to swallow her rivals at the 
quarter-pole. Instead, she was handed her second straight defeat after 
beginning her career with two imposing wins. 
</P>
<P>
"She came up empty the last eighth of a mile," Stevens said. "I lost a lot of 
ground, but she didn't fire the last quarter-mile like I felt she was going 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, the leading trainer at Del Mar and Oak Tree, started off as if he 
might be in line for a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
He doubled Wednesday, winning the second race with maiden Lori's Wonder and the 
ninth with the promising 2-year-old, Silver Ending. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start on grass, the son of Silver Hawk, who also sired 
Hawkster, won easily and may be the horse to beat in the Hoist the Flag Stakes 
on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending also completed a double for Stevens, the lone rider to get more 
than one victory. He also took the seventh with 11-1 shot Runaway Blues. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The on-track handle was $2,866,763, contrasting with $3,349,424 a year ago. The 
figure was the smallest for an opening day at Hollywood Park since $2,837,187 
was bet in 1971. The per-capita wagering, however, was a solid $244.42. . . . 
The Moccasin was trainer Terry Knight's first stakes win in Southern 
California. . . . Owiseone paid $12 and $4.40. There was no show betting 
because of the small field. . . . Sunday Silence's arthroscopic surgery to 
remove a chip from his knee is scheduled for 11 a.m. today and should take less 
than an hour to complete.

<P>
Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski opened the Hollywood Park meeting with a 
mythical $1,000 bankroll. On Wednesday's opening card, he bet $20 across on 
Portal in the third race. Portal finished last, resulting in a loss of $60. 
</P>
<P>
Bob will make at least one wager on racing days. He could make a straight win 
bet, he could make a daily double bet, he could make an exacta bet, he could 
make other exotic bets, or any combination of bets. But, he will make at least 
one bet. 
</P>
<P>
For Thursday, Bob will make $10 doubles bets from Lou's Fast, B'Gotcha and 
Wyoming in the first to Cool And Sedate in the second.

S. AFRICA SKIRTS THE SANCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IS A STEEL GIRDER NOT STEEL? WHEN IT COMES FROM SOUTH AFRICA. SOME IN 
CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To some, the case of the South African steel seems to defy logic. 
</P>
<P>
At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed 
by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel 
since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in 
1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But 
girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed 
from the steel mill. In the language of government, a "substantial 
transformation" had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid) 
act," explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to 
others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt 
the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit 
importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and 
agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South 
African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be 
exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel 
products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are 
undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles, 
are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to 
trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting 
there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United 
States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the 
law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by 
so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls 
or partly owns. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of 
methods, including "laundering" shipments through other countries, as a way of 
moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed 
trade embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations 
subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), the chairman, in a letter to then acting U.S. Customs Commissioner 
Michael Lane, complained that the government "appears still to be accepting the 
most outrageous legal arguments of steel importers rather than trying to assess 
the clear intent of Congress. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation states that "no iron or steel produced, or iron ore extracted, 
in South Africa may be imported into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The task of enforcing the law fell to the Office of Foreign Assets Control at 
the Treasury Department, which identifies only 15 items as iron or steel 
products. 
</P>
<P>
A Treasury official argued that the list did indeed satisfy the intent of the 
law and, in fact, may have gone beyond it by including items such as wire 
products. Others, however, disagree with that interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"The law absolutely bans all iron and steel from South Africa after Dec. 31, 
1986," said Rep. John Bryant, (D-Tex.), who has become one of the major 
proponents of broadening the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the 'Low Road' 
</P>
<P>
Another who considers the interpretation to be too narrow is Gay McDougall, 
director of the South Africa Project of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee 
for Civil Rights Under Law. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Reagan) Administration was on the record as being against these 
sanctions," she said. "Clearly, they took the low road in terms of enforcement 
and implementation. They have taken the narrowest interpretation of the embargo 
possible, and they haven't taken all the steps to fully implement it." 
</P>
<P>
Import figures show that the sanctions have had some effect, but by no means 
have closed off trade with South Africa. In 1986, the year before the embargo, 
the United States imported $301-million worth of iron and steel from South 
Africa and, overall, imported goods worth more than $2.3 billion from that 
country. In the following two years, more than $353.6-million worth of iron and 
steel have been imported from South Africa, according to the U.S. Department of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Billions in Imports 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of the Census reported that since the beginning of 1987, more than 
11,000 tons of goods categorized as "other steel products" have been imported 
from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, iron and steel ranked as the fourth-largest category of imports from 
South Africa to the United States, according to Commerce Department statistics. 
During that year, the last for which the Commerce Department had figures, the 
United States imported more than $1.5-billion worth of goods from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are assumed to be conservative, since they do not count goods 
transshipped through other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, for instance, Timothy Zwane, principal secretary for commerce, 
industry and tourism in Swaziland, complained that South African firms were 
using false documents to export goods as Swazi products. He cited as an example 
a shipment of 50 tons of cut flowers, said to have originated in Swaziland, 
that were exported to Europe, where sanctions against South Africa are also in 
force. The only problem was that Swaziland produces nowhere near that amount of 
flowers. He also pointed out that Swaziland does not grow apples, pears or 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet we constantly find, when we travel around (that) people talk about 
Swaziland apples, pears and grapes," he was quoted as saying. "Of course, we 
are surprised." 
</P>
<P>
In another case, a U.S. Customs official described how an ostrich egg laid in 
South Africa was transferred to another country, where it was hatched, and the 
chick eventually was shipped to the United States. It was considered a legal 
import because the chick was not hatched in South Africa. The same official 
described how South African rock lobsters are allowed into the United States 
because they are processed and shipped on vessels registered to another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, a former South African bank manager told a House subcommittee that 
a number of European banks were using their New York offices to disguise South 
African transactions, including some prohibited by the sanctions. Terry 
Crawford-Browne, now an adviser to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he could not 
document his allegations, but that his past banking experience led him to 
believe this was occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations said in a report in 
July that South Africa had responded to the sanctions by developing what is 
widely known as "unconventional trade." 
</P>
<P>
The report described a raft of methods used to get around the sanctions, from 
simple mislabeling to transshipment through several countries. One example: A 
chain of private trading companies passes formal title to the goods among 
themselves until the real owner and destination are impossible to detect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is intended to confuse or deter monitoring through sheer complexity," the 
report said. "Invariably, the actual movement of the goods is much more direct. 
In monitoring oil shipments to South Africa it has been observed that, whereas 
the tanker sails directly from the port of loading to South Africa, title to 
the cargo may change hands 10 to 15 times among traders and brokers in a number 
of different countries." 
</P>
<P>
'Dutch Blend' Coal 
</P>
<P>
The report also explained how South Africa ships coal to places where it is not 
banned. It mentioned Rotterdam and Antwerp. The South African coal is then 
mixed with shipments from other locales to obscure the coal's origin. In the 
parlance of trade, the Rotterdam product is known as "Dutch blend." 
</P>
<P>
Given the lax U.S. enforcement, many South African products need not take such 
circuitous routes to reach America, McDougall of the South Africa Project said. 
In the project's 135-page report last year, for example, McDougall was highly 
critical of the Treasury Department's definition of uranium products covered by 
the sanctions. While uranium and uranium oxide are banned, uranium hexafluoride 
is not. Thus, she said, only uranium in its beginning and finished forms are 
banned, while the products of interim processing may be imported and then 
easily transformed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Treasury Department's interpretation permits easy circumvention of the 
sanction," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, a report of the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm 
of the Congress -- said that sanctions against South Africa had been enforced 
only partially because the State Department never gave Customs a detailed list 
of parastatal products. It had only identified the parastatal companies. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) one of the most ardent foes of South Africa's 
white minority government, described the GAO's findings as showing a "shocking 
lapse by top Reagan Administration officials, who failed to apply elementary 
enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid laws." 
</P>
<P>
The whole question of sanctions is a tricky and controversial one that is 
further complicated by the fact that the 1986 provisions were the first in 
modern times enacted by the Congress rather than the President. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration deemed sanctions to be counterproductive in any 
effort to get the South African government to end its minority rule. But when 
Congress overrode Reagan's veto, it did so in very selective fashion, with the 
announced intent of hurting just the South African government's tax base, not 
the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the imports section specified only textiles, agricultural 
products, iron and steel, coal and uranium and any article grown or produced, 
manufactured or exported by a parastatal. It was not until 1987 that gold, 
which accounts for about 45% of South Africa's export revenues, came under the 
sanctions. At that time gold was defined as a parastatal product, the 
government entity being the South African Reserve Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was 
quoted as saying that the sanctions have been "effective in bringing about new 
thinking in Pretoria." 
</P>
<P>
McDougall and others say that the sanctions would be far more effective if they 
were of the blanket variety imposed in the past against Libya, North Vietnam, 
North Korea and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including South African officials and many white South Africans who 
oppose apartheid, follow the Reagan line of thinking. They say the U.S. 
sanctions are hitting labor-intensive industries such as farming and coal 
mining, and thus hurting the black South African labor force. 
</P>
<P>
From that standpoint, "the sanctions have been a complete failure," said 
Michael Johns, a South African specialist at the conservative, Washington-based 
Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, in a report released last month, addressed the question of whether 
further restrictions on gold might be feasible. The conclusions were mixed, but 
the report did point out that while gold is banned, much of it comes into the 
United States anyway, as Italian jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that South Africa markets most of its gold through Britain and 
Switzerland, and those countries then redistribute it. Almost all of the gold 
that goes to Italy, the world's leading consumer, is made into jewelry, which 
is then marketed around the world. The GAO said that 91% of all gold entering 
Italy comes from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of the House oversight subcommittee said that hearings on 
the importation of South African steel and steel products should begin in the 
next several weeks, and that Treasury and Customs officials will be called to 
explain their rationale on the importation of girders for the Texas bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bryant has sent the Treasury Department a letter requesting details of all 
transactions in which iron and steel have been allowed into the United States 
since the embargoes were imposed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Sen. Kennedy said that an effort to tighten the sanctions will be 
made during this session of Congress. (The House last year passed a bill to 
widen the sanctions, but it did not make it to the Senate floor before the end 
of that session.) 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of loopholes we've got to close," he said. "We didn't cover a 
lot of things."

SAN SALVADOR SLUMS REELING UNDER ATTACKS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As fighting intensified around guerrilla strongholds in the Salvadoran capital 
Wednesday, a thunderous explosion shook the roomful of slum dwellers holed up 
in a Catholic mission called St. Mary of the Poor in Santa Marta. 
</P>
<P>
A rocket-propelled grenade, apparently aimed at a rebel bunker 50 yards away, 
crashed into the gray, concrete-block shelter, wounding two children and two 
adults among 150 people already driven from their shacks, witnesses said. The 
rest evacuated the shelter during a lull in the fighting, waving white flags 
above their heads, to seek refuge in a nearby parish. 
</P>
<P>
Such harrowing scenes have been played out hour after hour over the past five 
days in Santa Marta and other poor districts during the worst urban combat of 
El Salvador's decade-old civil war. A tour of the capital Wednesday showed just 
how close the war is hitting home, even amid government assertions of a rebel 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid this is not going to end soon," said Nelly Campos, a volunteer 
worker at St. Mary of the Poor. "The (rebels) have lots of collaborators and 
lots and lots of strength. They are not going to leave here alive." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the neighborhood said several bombs fell near their homes from 
A-37 fighter jets late Tuesday and early Wednesday in an apparent escalation of 
government air strikes on rebel positions. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and morgues reported that 204 people have been killed in the capital, 
81 of them civilians, since rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN) launched an offensive Saturday. Another 926 civilians have been 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic relief workers said 2,730 people have crowded into eight shelters 
around the city and thousands more, including uncounted numbers of wounded, are 
trapped in their neighborhoods by the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross and the Roman Catholic hierarchy urged both armies 
Wednesday to call a six-hour cease-fire to allow for evacuation of the wounded. 
The government rejected the appeal to stop its counteroffensive but promised 
not to impede relief work. 
</P>
<P>
However, government forces raided one shelter in a Catholic basilica and seized 
food that a Jesuit-run relief agency was taking to another agency. 
</P>
<P>
Gunfire could be heard from anywhere in this city of 1.5 million people 
Wednesday. The few private cars and people on the streets carried white flags. 
Soldiers with grease-painted faces guarded gas stations, and most businesses 
were shut. Garbage piled up. Wrecks of cars hit by guns and grenades littered 
the roadsides, and scattered light poles lay bent on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the army chief of staff, said the rebels have begun 
retreating from the capital. U.S. Ambassador William Walker said "significant 
numbers" of the estimated 1,500 guerrillas in town are moving out. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing in the U.S. Embassy, Walker displayed a map showing rectangular 
areas of northern and eastern San Salvador where rebels have held sway on each 
of the past three days. The rectangles on the map grow progressively smaller, 
from about one-third of the city's area Monday to one-tenth of it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast on the guerrilla's clandestine radio Wednesday did not 
acknowledge a retreat; nor did it repeat earlier boasts of glorious advances. 
The broadcast said simply that guerrillas held their ground against government 
counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
No letup in the fighting was evident in Santa Marta, in southeastern San 
Salvador, one of 14 neighborhoods where U.S. officials said the guerrillas were 
still dug in. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who took refuge at the Catholic mission there told how the fighting 
has swept in and out of their neighborhood, keeping them in a shifting line of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
They said about 50 guerrillas entered Santa Marta late Saturday and asked 
people to help dig trenches and build barricades to keep the army out. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Marta has always been a zone where the guerrillas move with relative 
ease. Unemployment is high there and people say they have not benefited from 
the $3 billion in U.S. economic aid poured into El Salvador over the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The guerrillas came (Saturday) and said 'We're on your side,' " recalled 
Lucila Cruz Martinez, 48, an itinerant food merchant. "The government has never 
done anything for the poor. It doesn't care that we don't eat. So we 
collaborated. The guerrillas said this would protect us." 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, however, the Treasury Police, a branch of the Salvadoran military, 
had fought its way into Santa Marta and ordered people by megaphone to get out 
of their homes within 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Two children were slightly wounded by shrapnel when a grenade hit their house 
just as the half-hour deadline expired, people in the shelter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We gathered the family, wrapped up the baby and ran," said Cruz Martinez, who 
took her husband, nine children and six grandchildren to the shelter with about 
150 other people. "There was no time to gather any food." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, Cruz Martinez sat barefoot on a concrete floor with her 
2-month-old grandson, who floundered on his back staring at the bare ceiling as 
machine-gun fire rattled from a guerrilla bunker just up the hill. Other 
children sat stoically against the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The church has provided food in the shelter. But the Treasury Police prevented 
volunteers from leaving the shelter after the 6 p.m. curfew Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the commander there were children going hungry out there," said 
Campos, the volunteer worker. "He told us: 'Why do they have to eat if they're 
going to die anyway?' " 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the food brigade said the argument over their mission ended 
when policemen opened fire at their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, the police occupied the shelter as a fortress as they opened 
fire at the guerrillas and drove them away from their own bunker, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An officer and four policemen were killed in the fighting, according to Father 
Daniel Sanchez, the neighborhood's Spanish-born Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the police asked him to help get the bodies out of the battle 
zone, and the rebels agreed at his behest to call a truce by both sides. But 
the police refused to halt their own fire and left their dead behind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the policemen retreated Tuesday afternoon, however, they fell into a 
mistaken-identity fire fight with an army unit in the neighborhood, several 
residents said. At least 10 civilians died in the cross-fire, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
Bombs began falling on the neighborhood as government forces pulled out, 
residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a fierce aerial show," said Father James Barnett, a Catholic priest 
in nearby Ciudad Credisa. "Fighter planes, jet aircraft and the C-47s with 
machine guns." 
</P>
<P>
A Salvadoran resident said the worst bombing came Tuesday at dusk and left 
"many dead" in Santa Marta. Sanchez said bombardments came 15 minutes after 
every hour between midnight and 5 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the thousands of civilians who continued to flee embattled 
neighborhoods on foot Wednesday blamed the guerrillas for their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't they take Escalon (a rich neighborhood)?" asked Miguel Rivas, 42, a 
plumber in Zacamil. "Why did they come to a poor area where we already suffer?"

QUERY FOCUSES ON SHERIFF'S SERGEANT, DEPUTIES HE LED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An investigation into alleged money-skimming by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
narcotics officers has focused primarily on suspended Sgt. Robert R. Sobel and 
14 deputies who have worked for him on three different drug squads since 1985, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 sheriff's officers suspended since the scandal broke Sept. 1, only 
four have not worked on crews headed by the hard-charging sergeant who 
frequently told his troops to "march or die" and who dubbed himself "El 
Diablo," or "The Devil," sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The department has suspended all but one of the deputies who worked for Sobel 
as narcotics officers at the Lennox Station in 1985-86, on a special inner-city 
cocaine task force in 1987 or recently on his elite team that investigated 
major drug cases, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining deputy was taken out of the field last month and reassigned to 
desk work. The deputy agreed to a search of his home, but nothing incriminating 
was found, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
"The common denominator for all of us is Sobel," said one suspended deputy. 
"He's had three (narcotics) crews, and everybody who's ever worked for him has 
been suspended except for one guy." 
</P>
<P>
Suspended officers interviewed by The Times spoke only on condition that they 
not be identified. They say they have been threatened with firing if they 
discuss the inquiry with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel's attorney, Mark Beck, said the sergeant, a 19-year veteran, "will not 
respond personally or through me" to any question about the money-skimming 
investigation. Sobel, through Beck, has maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel is described by close associates as a highly private family man who 
joined the department in 1970. Beck has characterized the sergeant as "an 
extremely bright, dedicated career deputy" who has "received a series of 
commendations over the years and was highly thought of." 
</P>
<P>
Sobel has long appeared to be a central target of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-foot sailboat he purchased for $31,500 in cash and cashier's checks in 
June was confiscated three months later by the government, which claims in 
federal warrants that the boat was purchased at least in part with stolen 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Several suspended deputies said investigators have questioned them about Sobel. 
One officer said that when federal agents "searched my place, many of their 
questions . . . were directly related to investigations I conducted" while on a 
Sobel crew years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Squad Suspended 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block suspended Sobel's entire nine-member major narcotics 
squad Sept. 1 after thousands of dollars turned up missing in an FBI sting 
operation two days earlier. Sobel was one of two officers responsible for 
booking $500,000 in planted cash as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Nine more narcotics officers were suspended Oct. 3, and five of them had worked 
for Sobel, sources said. Four were teamed with him on the Southwest Task Force, 
which was known originally as the Freeway Rick Task Force because it was formed 
in January, 1987, to build a case against alleged South-Central Los Angeles 
cocaine boss Ricky Donnell Ross, according to sources and court documents. 
</P>
<P>
That special unit -- initially comprised of four deputies, four Los Angeles 
Police Department officers and directed by Sobel -- was accused by several 
witnesses of theft and brutality during investigations of Ross and other 
suspected cocaine traffickers, court documents show. Numerous complaints of 
wide-ranging misconduct were also filed in 1987 with the FBI and the sheriff's 
internal affairs bureau, according to attorneys for clients who said they were 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Fenster, the lawyer who forwarded the complaints of several of his 
clients, said investigators in the current money-skimming inquiry have asked 
him about the allegations and he has discussed the case with Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Thomas Hagemann, who is coordinating the local and federal inquiry. 
Hagemann would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking charges against Ross were dismissed by Los Angeles Municipal 
Judge Alban I. Niles in mid-1987 because four officers allegedly destroyed 
Ross' relationship with Fenster by maligning the lawyer in a lengthy, 
tape-recorded interview at Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
A forensic expert subsequently concluded that 11 erasures had been made on the 
tape, obliterating portions of the interview where the officers were critical 
of Fenster and where they discuss allegations that they had beaten Ross' 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad," Deputy Dist. Atty. John F. Urgo, who prosecuted Ross, said of the 
jailhouse interview. "Their attacks were on Fenster. The court ruled that (the 
officers) had destroyed that (attorney-client) relationship. You can't fix the 
problem by just giving him another attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about Sobel's crews went beyond the Ross case. His Lennox Station 
crew and the task force force raided dozens of homes in 1987, fostering 
complaints of beatings, theft of money and lies in search warrants, according 
to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
A cocaine-trafficking case was undercut in 1987 because a Superior Court judge 
concluded that Sobel's Lennox Station crew had administered "street justice" by 
beating suspect Derrick Leichman. The judge also concluded that the officers 
were not telling the truth about where they found cocaine during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Officers reported seizing $45,000 from the home of Leichman and co-defendant 
Jessie Harrod, but evidence records showed that only $15,000 was turned in, 
Fenster maintained in court. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses, testifying about prior incidents involving Sobel and his 
deputies, alleged that money or property was stolen from them and that they 
were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
No Response 
</P>
<P>
There was no response to the allegations in the court record. Nor did 
prosecutors call deputies to the stand to answer the charges. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Judge Bernard J. Kamins, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the 
case against Harrod, while Leichman received three years' probation instead of 
a possible five-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, in an interview, told The Times that he thought the defendants were 
"dead-bang guilty." 
</P>
<P>
"But here's the rub," Kamins said. "The officers said (Leichman) slipped and 
fell on the sidewalk, . . . but this guy was beaten to a pulp." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said prosecutors provided information about the officers in 
confidence that led to the light sentences. He would not elaborate, but added: 
"There was a pattern of people getting hurt when certain officers were 
involved. It was almost like they were taking justice into their own hands, and 
that's a frightening concept." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the brutality complaints against Sobel's crews involved then-Deputy 
Robert Tolmaire, who worked on the Lennox Station crew in 1985-86 then as a 
lead investigator on the Ricky Ross task force. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kamins likened Tolmaire, now a sergeant, to a "heavy-handed parent taking 
things into his own hands" on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Another judge, Municipal Judge James F. Nelson, noted in the preliminary 
hearing for Leichman that Tolmaire had "an apparent end-may-justify-the-means 
approach" when dealing with suspected criminals. That assessment came after 
several witnesses testified that they were battered during raids in 1986 and 
1987 by Lennox Station deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Tolmaire could not be reached for comment, but a former member of the Ross task 
force said that in dozens of raids with Tolmaire he had never seen the short, 
stocky deputy strike a suspect without good cause. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not an intimidating-type person," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got to understand about these crooks is that they know the 
system," the officer said. "You can have a rat who's out destroying half the 
world, and the first thing he'll do when he's caught is offer information about 
'dirty cops.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tolmaire, J. C. Miller and Roger Garcia, all Lennox Station deputies under 
Sobel, were relieved of duty during the second round of suspensions a month 
ago, according to government and sheriff's sources. 
</P>
<P>
Ross task force members Edward Jamison, John L. Edner and Terrell H. Amers were 
also suspended, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies could not be reached for comment. None of them, except Amers, has 
been identified by the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Sobel's last squad -- the major-investigations unit -- were 
identified by Sheriff Block when they were suspended two months ago after the 
FBI sting operation. They are Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, Eufrasio 
G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner and Michael J. 
Kaliterna. 
</P>
<P>
While Sobel and Brown were responsible for booking the $500,000 in planted 
cash, Bauder was caught on videotape transferring bundles of money into 
Garner's satchel, sources have said. Garner's attorney has said that the cash 
later was turned over to Brown for booking. 
</P>
<P>
The one Sobel subordinate still on the job is a deputy who worked for him for 
only a few months on that last crew, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The only officer from another law enforcement agency to be implicated in the 
money-skimming scandal is a Los Angeles Police Department narcotics officer who 
worked for Sobel on the Ross task force in 1987. His home was searched under 
warrant last month, but nothing incriminating was found, his superiors said. 
</P>
<P>
Together Sobel and the 13 suspended deputies who worked with him represent 
roughly 10% of the narcotics officers in the Sheriff's Department. About 40 
deputies worked on four crews that investigated major drug cases before they 
were disbanded in September because of the scandal. About 100 officers work on 
special task forces or routine street details out of sheriff's stations 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9 Sobel left no doubt who was in charge of his crews, several 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd stay out two or three days in the field," said a suspended deputy. "He 
was a hard-charger. If he told you to be there at 7 in the morning, he'd be 
there at 6." 
</P>
<P>
Sobel began to call himself El Diablo while on the Ross task force, said 
another officer, and the nickname stuck when he went to the major-case crew in 
mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of fancied himself as a tough guy," the officer said. "Some guys, when 
they get a nickname, they say, 'Don't call me that.' But he kind of liked that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
"March or die" -- a motto of the French Foreign Legion in Algeria -- was a 
phrase the sergeant would use when deputies would complain about long workdays 
or an assignment, deputies said. "In a nutshell that was his philosophy," one 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Several suspended deputies who have worked with Sobel said the current 
investigation has forced them to reassess the conduct of the intense Sobel. And 
some are pointing fingers at a man they say they once admired. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said Sobel, as field supervisor, almost always took seized money into 
custody during raids and sometimes the initial count of money in the field did 
not jibe with the final count. 
</P>
<P>
"You just say, 'Well, maybe (the count) was just off,' and you just let it 
ride," said one deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Given the information about Sobel that has surfaced in the current probe, some 
suspended deputies now say the Sheriff's Department should have taken more 
seriously the earlier complaints about Sobel's crews. 
</P>
<P>
Block recently criticized such second-guessing. He said he was sure that his 
department's internal affairs bureau looked into the past allegations of theft 
and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not proven to be founded," Block said, adding that narcotics 
officers are often the target of false complaints. "People working on some 
assignments generate more complaints than others." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on Sept. 1 suspended nine narcotics 
officers suspected of stealing money during drug raids. Nine more officers -- 
mostly from elite squads that investigated major drug cases -- were suspended 
Oct. 3. But no charges have yet been filed.

HOUSE LEADERS WIN BUSH SUPPORT FOR 33% PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House leaders won President Bush's strong endorsement Wednesday for a package 
of pay and ethics reforms that would raise annual congressional salaries by 
more than 33% to more than $120,000 in the next 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the proposal were made public less than 24 hours before the House is 
scheduled to vote on it today. The plan would give House members an immediate 
7.9% "cost of living" hike, followed in January, 1991, by a 25% raise and an 
additional unspecified cost-of-living increase. 
</P>
<P>
Federal judges and top executive branch employees, some of whom already have 
received a cost-of-living raise this year, would be guaranteed the same 
salaries under the House proposal. The current salary for most members of 
Congress, judges and top Administration officials is $89,500. 
</P>
<P>
The pay hike, which will cost taxpayers an estimated $70 million in fiscal 
1990, is linked to the first major revision of House ethics rules since 1977. 
Under the plan, House members would not be permitted to pocket their appearance 
fees after January, 1991, and no member could convert excess campaign funds to 
personal use upon his retirement after January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics reform was prompted by a string of embarrassing scandals in recent 
years, particularly by the investigation and subsequent ouster of former House 
Speaker Jim Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's successor, Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), said that he expects the package 
to be adopted by the House, even though it has drawn strong opposition from the 
same coalition of taxpayers' groups and radio talk show hosts who defeated a 
51% pay hike proposal earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous pay increase, the new package has the support of both 
Republicans and Democrats -- including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who was an 
outspoken critic of the previous proposal. In addition, House leaders have 
disarmed the opposition so far by keeping the details of the proposal secret 
until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
The final House package was the result of seven months of behind-the-scenes 
negotiations between the House, the Senate, the White House and the judiciary. 
House leaders agreed to a number of last-minute changes in the proposal to 
obtain the President's pledge that he will sign the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the President sent a letter to Foley saying that he hoped the 
package would be enacted before Congress adjourns for the year, perhaps as 
early as next week. He said that the pay increase would help the government 
retain personnel whose skills "are essential to the quality of service 
government provides to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate is expected to approve a much smaller pay hike for itself, 
Senate leaders have indicated that they will not stop House members, judges and 
top executive branch employees from getting an increase in excess of 33%. The 
House and Senate traditionally have had different ethics rules but have not had 
different salaries in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the pay hike, House members no longer would be permitted to 
pocket honorariums from special interest groups after January, 1991. At 
present, they are allowed to accept honorariums equivalent to 30% of their 
annual salaries, or $26,850. Until 1991, the allowable honorariums limit will 
be frozen at $26,850. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal does not prohibit House members from accepting honorariums of 
up to $2,000 for every appearance if they contribute the money to nonprofit 
organizations. Members will still be required to disclose the names of the 
groups paying the honorariums but the recipients of these donations will 
continue to be secret. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the House, the Senate is not expected to prohibit its members from 
pocketing their honorariums in the future. At present, senators can earn 
honorariums equivalent to 40% of their annual salaries, or 10% more than 
members of the House are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 200-page legislation had not yet been printed by Wednesday night, 
House leaders said that the provisions of the bill will include these changes 
in House rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- House members and top federal officials would be prohibited from accepting 
compensation for serving on corporate boards of directors or for performing 
professional services. Nevertheless, some outside earned income would be 
permitted -- such as teaching fees -- up to a limit equivalent to 15% of their 
annual pay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- House members would be prohibited from accepting gifts in excess of $200 
from any source, except relatives. Personal hospitality and meals are exempt 
from this rule as long as they are not claimed by a corporation for a tax 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Travel by House members that is funded by special interest groups would be 
limited to four days and three nights within the borders of the United States 
or seven days and six nights for overseas junkets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All future cost-of-living increases for House members would be computed by 
using the Economic Cost Index for private industry salaries, minus 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, hailed the House package as a big 
improvement in the standards of conduct set for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It really goes after the use of special-interest money to buy influence," said 
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer. 
</P>
<P>
But consumer advocate Ralph Nader and the National Taxpayers' Union condemned 
the ethics package as nothing more than a subterfuge for a huge pay increase at 
a time when federal agencies are suffering budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Bush's support, House leaders agreed at the last minute to 
accept somewhat stronger restrictions on the lobbying activities of 
congressional employes after they leave government service. The White House 
insisted that the rules governing congressional employes be similar to those 
imposed on executive branch workers.

STATE ORDERS HALT IN SALE OF L-TRYPTOPHAN; 
</P>

HEALTH: FOOD SUPPLEMENT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF 154 CASES OF A RARE BLOOD DISORDER, 
19 IN CALIFORNIA. STUDY OF THE SUBSTANCE IS PLANNED.

State Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer on Wednesday ordered retail merchants to 
discontinue the sale of L-Tryptophan, an over-the-counter food supplement used 
for sleeping problems and premenstrual syndrome, which he said may be to blame 
for 154 cases of a rare blood disorder 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said more study is needed to determine if there is a direct link between 
L-Tryptophan and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a blood disorder marked 
by a higher-than-normal number of a certain type of white blood cell and severe 
muscle pain. Other symptoms may include weakness, swelling of the arms and 
legs, fever and skin rash. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Kizer said, 19 cases of the disorder have been reported in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Most victims reported taking the food supplement before becoming ill, he told a 
Capitol press conference. Some of the patients had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are hundreds of thousands of people in California who use 
this product and are potentially at risk," Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there have been any deaths from the blood disorder, the state health 
official said there have been "no substantiated reports of deaths" but that 
investigation of some cases is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
As for for the possible link between L-Tryptophan and the blood disorder, Kizer 
said, "While there is not an obvious physiologic link, the statistical data are 
very strong. This seems to be a new condition. 
</P>
<P>
"There does not appear to be any clear-cut treatment for the condition at this 
time," he added. "Likewise, the long-term force of the illness is not known." 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said a study will be jointly conducted by the state Department of Health 
Services, the federal Food and Drug Administration and the national Centers for 
Disease Control to determine if the food supplement does cause the syndrome. 
Kizer said the study will take "a minimum of weeks and quite possibly longer." 
</P>
<P>
He asked that people who have been taking L-Tryptophan and believe that they 
are experiencing abnormal symptoms to consult their physicians, who should 
report cases to city or county health departments. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the state health official requested California consumers taking the 
food supplement to temporarily discontinue its use. He also asked retailers to 
discontinue its sale until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
"But some retailers have not complied with this request," Kizer said, adding 
that the state Department of Health Services will now send food and drug 
investigators into retail stores to insure that all retailers pull the food 
supplement from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
L-Tryptophan is manufactured in Japan, according to Kizer, and distributed in 
California by numerous suppliers. At the press conference, he displayed a 
bottle from the Vita-Fresh Vitamin Co. of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment, Michael Leiner, chairman of the board of Vita-Fresh's parent 
company, P-Leiner Nutritional Products, said, "Yesterday we advised all of our 
retailer customers to temporarily take all L-Tryptophan products off their 
shelves until this mystery is solved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working closely with the FDA to see if we can assist them in 
determining whether there is any link between eosinophilia and L-Tryptophan 
products. At this stage, the connection is purely circumstantial." 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said L-Tryptophan's popularity has risen dramatically during the past few 
years. It is also touted as a relaxant or stress reducer, "but its efficacy is 
unproven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is sold as a food supplement instead of a drug, it is not subject to 
the same stringent testing process, he said.

REAGANS SEE THEIR WHITE HOUSE PORTRAITS

His hair shorter and noticeably grayer, his statutory authority gone but his 
sense of humor intact, former President Ronald Reagan returned to the White 
House Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Nancy, standing by, he took one look at their official 
portraits, on display for the first time, and cracked: "They're sure different 
than a lot of those cartoons we had to put up with." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was full of the jokes that he had used to spice his speeches throughout 
his White House years. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, George and Barbara and distinguished guests: As Henry VIII said to each 
one of his six wives, I won't keep you long," he began. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really find the words to express how I feel to be back here in this 
house," Reagan said. "Maybe it's because my staff is a bit smaller now than it 
used to be," he added, referring to the fact that he no longer has a stable of 
presidential speech writers. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said that Reagan's likeness "reflects the qualities that make 
him so special -- kindness, gallantry, decency and humor." 
</P>
<P>
Bush proved himself gallant as well in describing Mrs. Reagan's portrait. 
</P>
<P>
"Here stands a person who refurbished the White House with grace and with 
elegance," he said, "who helped millions of Americans say 'no' to drugs and 
started what has become a real crusade across our country -- thank God: No to 
drugs and yes to life." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony ended, Reagan squeezed in one more story, this one from a 
state dinner honoring French President Francois Mitterrand and his wife, 
Danielle. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mitterrand said something to him twice in French, and Reagan asked an 
interpreter to tell him what she had said. "I was standing on her gown," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The separate portraits of the Reagans were painted in oil by Aaron Shikler of 
New York. The former President's will be hung on the first floor of the White 
House. Mrs. Reagan's will be hung one floor below, on the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait ceremony was the final event in a day that found the Reagans going 
from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other. On Capitol Hill, he drew a 
cheering crowd of 1,500 at the noon dedication of the Ronald Reagan Republican 
Center, headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had lunch at the Commerce Department and stopped in southeast Washington 
at the Martin Luther King Elementary School, which he "adopted" in 1983 at the 
same time that he chose Rudolph Hines, then 7, as a pen pal. Reagan told about 
200 youngsters to "study hard . . . be good friends and neighbors . . . tell 
your parents what you learn and ask them to help you."

LEBANON: A CALIFORNIA WOMAN IS BELIEVED AMONG THE NEW HOSTAGES.

The Organization of Just Revenge, a previously unknown group, claimed Wednesday 
to have kidnaped three foreigners in West Beirut. It identified them as Deborah 
Fahrend of San Geronimo, Calif., and two naturalized West Germans. 
</P>
<P>
The group claimed responsibility in a typewritten statement delivered to an 
international news agency in the Lebanese capital. Photocopies of the hostages' 
passports were enclosed, and State Department officials said they are taking 
the statement seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The latest abduction claim came a week after the United States returned $567 
million of frozen assets to Iran as part of a new effort to free the eight 
Americans already held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. counterterrorism officials said, however, that there were no indications 
that a pro-Iranian Shiite group was responsible. In the past, women seized by 
various cells under the umbrella of Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been 
released, a State Department official noted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other groups that have taken Americans in the past. It may even be a 
local affair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fahrend was reportedly traveling with Mounir Shamseddin Sami and his son 
Daniel, 7. Sami, who is Lebanese-born, has parents still living in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
If the kidnaping is confirmed, Fahrend, 54, would be the only female foreigner 
held in Lebanon. There are 16 other Western hostages in Lebanon, some of whom 
have been held for almost five years. More than 2,000 Lebanese have been taken 
hostage since the civil war erupted in 1975, according to the local Red 
Crescent organization. 
</P>
<P>
In a typewritten communique in Arabic, the Organization of Just Revenge said 
that it had abducted the three because "of their activities in Lebanon." The 
poorly written letter contained no specific demands for the release of the new 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Fahrend's passport describes her as a publisher-journalist. The photocopied 
documents indicate that she entered Lebanon on Nov. 3 through the Lebanese port 
of Juniyah in the Christian-dominated enclave. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported from Beirut that the photocopied passport 
identified Fahrend's parents as Margaret and Frederick Brooks. The passport was 
issued in San Francisco on Oct. 15, 1984. The AP also quoted an employee of the 
post office in San Geronimo, a small Marin County town about 20 miles north of 
San Francisco, as saying that Fahrend maintained a postal box there for many 
years, but that she had left the area in 1987 for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that the photocopy was too poor to confirm that the 
passport number was the same as that issued to Fahrend. The United States has 
limited access to Lebanon since it withdrew all embassy personnel on Sept. 22. 
All consular affairs are now handled in Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to prevent American citizens from visiting Lebanon, the State 
Department requires that holders of U.S. passports receive a special waiver. 
Violators are subject to penalties. The State Department said it is checking to 
see if Fahrend had applied for a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Embassy in Beirut said it was unaware of the kidnapings until 
the statement was delivered to a news agency.

IRAQ EXODUS: WAGES FROZEN, EGYPTIANS HEAD HOME

Nearly 3,000 Egyptian workers a day have begun streaming home from Iraq in a 
massive exodus triggered by the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq War and Iraq's 
decision to hold up an estimated $300 million in wages. 
</P>
<P>
As thousands of Egyptians crowded the airport terminal at the Iraqi capital of 
Baghdad this week demanding tickets, authorities said they were also 
investigating reports that more than 100 Egyptian corpses were flown home from 
Iraq last month. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies have been arriving at Cairo International Airport at the rate of three 
or four a day. Death certificates, which originally listed many of the causes 
of death as "bullet wounds," have recently attributed the deaths to "accident" 
or "butane gas cylinder explosion," according to the Egyptian state-owned 
newspaper, Al Akbar. 
</P>
<P>
Five new bodies arrived Wednesday, two of them with smashed skulls, the 
newspaper said. But Iraqi government authorities said the number of deaths is 
not unusual in light of the number of Egyptian workers in Iraq, estimated at 
more than 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday that he could not confirm 
the number of deaths or the circumstances behind them, but he said Egyptian 
Prime Minister Atef Sedki is scheduled to meet Saturday with a high-level Iraqi 
delegation to discuss the worsening Egyptian worker crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been working on it through diplomatic channels, and we hope in the 
days to come we can come up with a satisfactory solution," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus from Baghdad corresponds with Iraq's decision six weeks ago to limit 
the amount of money that unskilled foreign workers can transfer out of the 
country to 10 dinars a month (about $55), which amounts in many cases to less 
than 10% of their earnings. Previously, workers were allowed to send up to half 
their salaries home. 
</P>
<P>
The decision comes in the wake of Iraq's eight-year-long war with Iran. A U.N. 
cease-fire in August brought an end to much of Iraq's foreign military aid, 
leaving the country strapped for foreign currency and burdened with a flood of 
soldiers competing with foreign workers for civilian jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Many Egyptians have lost their jobs, and others have complained about a 
deterioration in working conditions, including unilateral wage reductions, 
non-payment of wages and occasional outbreaks of violence, together with the 
new limits on transferring their earnings home. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the flood of returning Egyptians, Iraqi Airways has increased its 
flights to Cairo from two a week to 10, and EgyptAir has added three additional 
weekly flights. For the last several days, more than 2,800 workers a day have 
been airlifted out of Baghdad, and others have gone home by bus through Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews at Cairo airport, Egyptian workers complained that they were 
arriving home virtually penniless because of the ceiling on wage transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Adel Said Sayed, a plumber who went to work in Baghdad last March, said he is 
taking home only $300 for eight months' work because of the transfer limit and 
because his employer refused to pay him all he was due. When he complained, 
Sayed said, "The man brings his gun and said, 'You must work. You should work 
or I will kill you and bury you here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein discounted claims that Egyptians have been 
mistreated in Iraq and dismissed reports of an increase in the number of 
workers who have died. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been millions of Egyptians here . . . and it is natural that, like 
Iraqis, some of them die, are killed in car accidents or in quarrels with 
Iraqis or among themselves," he said in a report on Iraq's official radio. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein also said some incidents of violence could be expected in the wake of 
the Iran-Iraq War. "People were in a continuous state of fighting a war for 
eight years . . . and we expected them to use their hands in quarrels when the 
war ends," he said.

SHAMIR SEES BUSH, TRIES TO REVIVE PEACE PROCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called Wednesday for an early meeting of 
U.S., Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers to revive the stalled Mideast 
peace process after an apparently acrimonious White House meeting in which he 
and President Bush aired festering differences. 
</P>
<P>
In separate statements, senior U.S. officials and Shamir said that the meeting 
helped to clarify the issues that have produced unusual friction between the 
close allies. Although both sides emphasized that the overall relationship is 
good, they made it clear that significant gaps remain over the details of plans 
to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Bush complained to Shamir about Israel's military cooperation with South 
Africa and about continuing Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. Although both issues have been discussed for years at lower 
diplomatic levels, they are seldom raised at such a high level. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater appealed for patience in a way 
that seemed to indicate that the Administration is running out of it: "It's 
important not to become impatient when you're dealing with the Middle East. Two 
thousand years is the normal wait for things to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Talking to a small group of reporters, Shamir said that basic decisions on the 
peace process will not be made until Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel 
Meguid meet to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"They will meet, I hope, very soon," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has said that a meeting of the three foreign ministers is 
the final step in Baker's five-point plan for U.S.-mediated negotiations 
between Israelis and Palestinians. But department officials said that the 
meeting should not be scheduled until all sides agree on the first four points, 
something that U.S. officials said Wednesday appears to be a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's policy-making Inner Cabinet voted 9 to 3 to accept the Baker plan "in 
principle," provided that the United States gives Israel assurances that it 
will not be asked to negotiate with Palestinians from outside the occupied 
territories or with anyone representing the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
The Israeli government also asked for guarantees that if the talks ever begin, 
they will be limited to the details of Israel's proposal for Palestinian

<P>
The Bush Administration did not offer the promises that Israel requested, 
officials on both sides said. Nor did Shamir yield on any of the points. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, both Shamir and U.S. officials emphasized that Egypt -- which 
is serving as unofficial surrogate for the PLO -- has not responded officially 
to Baker's five points. A senior State Department official said that the talks 
cannot proceed until Egypt gives its official answer. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Bush's criticism of Israel's military cooperation with South 
Africa, Shamir said he told the President that his government decided two years 
ago to sever the relationship but intended to honor contracts "until they 
expire." He denied that Israel has aided South Africa in developing a 
nuclear-capable ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also said that he made it clear to Bush that his government will not 
withdraw from any of the previously Arab-controlled territory it now occupies, 
even to obtain a peace agreement with the Arab world. The United States has 
long advocated such a territory-for-peace swap.

BUSH ACTS TO ALLAY ALLIES' FEARS ABOUT SUMMIT

President Bush sought Wednesday to allay concern that he and Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, preparing for their summit meeting at a time of turmoil 
and uncertainty across Central and Eastern Europe, will use their private 
conference "to negotiate the future of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the AFL-CIO, Bush said that he wants to hear what Gorbachev 
"thinks of the challenges that he faces at home and of the new course that he 
has set out for Soviet policy in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, on U.S. and Soviet naval ships in the Mediterranean Sea near Malta 
on Dec. 2 and 3, appears certain to focus on the wave of political reform that 
has swept through East Germany and other Soviet allies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke to the union convention -- which his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, 
refused to address for eight years -- with Lech Walesa, the leader of the 
Polish trade union Solidarity, at his side. It was the Walesa-led movement that 
spearheaded the Polish political reforms that have themselves become models for 
the political openings occurring in Hungary and East Germany and showing signs 
of taking root in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
The President called on the American labor movement, the business community and 
the government "to look for ways to support a partnership for progress in 
Poland." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. support for the non-Communist reform movements led to a warning from 
Gorbachev on Tuesday not to read the sudden political relaxation as an 
invitation to export capitalism eastward. In response, White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the United States would not take such 
advantage of the turmoil -- but that it would continue to condition its support 
on economic and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that the steps taken by the Administration to encourage the 
reform movements in Eastern Europe -- limited mostly to verbal encouragement 
and offers of financial assistance and food -- "have had the desired effect of 
offering our support without inciting revolution or other actions that would 
take the process backwards." 
</P>
<P>
The two summit partners, in Moscow and Washington, have found themselves in the 
midst of a carefully orchestrated performance leading up to the Malta meeting, 
with each side trying to position itself so that it can emerge from the 
conference claiming success. Fitzwater sought to play down the likelihood that 
the meeting would produce specific agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, he said, "have had a tendency in past summits to build 
expectations before a summit, and we have a tendency to play them down. I 
suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in emphasizing that he and Gorbachev would not meet to decide the future 
of Europe -- as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet leader Josef Stalin and 
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill presided over the partitioning of 
Europe at Yalta in 1945 -- told the AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"The peoples of Eastern Europe are speaking their own minds about that future. 
They are calling for democracy. Freedom of press and of conscience. The right 
of the governed to choose their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"At Malta, I will work to advance that process of reform and democracy," Bush 
said. He vowed to talk with Gorbachev "about the opportunities to move beyond 
containment in U.S.-Soviet relations -- to find areas of mutual advantage in 
our relationship."

HOUSE DEMOCRATS DECIDE 'AIR FOLEY' DOESN'T FLY 
</P>

<P>
Hit by flak from Administration officials and others, House Democratic leaders 
Wednesday grounded an effort to create a one-plane air force commanded by 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
The leaders dropped the plan to put a $19-million military jet under control of 
the Speaker after presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called it a "foolish 
idea" and others ridiculed it as "Air Foley" and "Foley's Royal Air Force." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal suddenly appeared in a compromise $285.8-billion defense spending 
measure crafted by House and Senate negotiators. Foley claimed to be surprised 
by the provision, which was tucked into the bill by Rep. John P. Murtha 
(D-Pa.), apparently without the knowledge of most other negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Murtha said that the military aircraft would give Foley needed protection from 
terrorists. Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), a chief advocate of the proposal, 
added that it would help lawmakers avoid flying corporate planes and thus would 
help them avoid conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
Disposal of the plan means that lawmakers will continue the current practice of 
requesting a plane from the Air Force when one is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the proposal was awkward for Foley, who is pushing a 33% pay 
raise and ethics package for House members in a vote scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The defense appropriation measure approved by the House and sent to the Senate 
for final action calls for spending nearly $286 billion in the fiscal year that 
began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That represents a $3.4-billion increase over last year and is $2.4 billion less 
than President Bush requested. 
</P>
<P>
The bill closely conforms to a funding authorization measure that won final 
congressional approval by the Senate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.8 billion approved for "Star Wars," the Strategic Defense Initiative, is 
a reduction of 22% from Bush's request of $4.9 billion. Although Congress has 
slashed the "Star Wars" funding request each year beginning in 1986, this is 
the first time that the budget for the anti-missile research program has been 
reduced below the previous year's level. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also provides $4.3 billion of the $4.7 billion requested to 
continue production of the B-2 Stealth bomber -- enough to buy two planes in 
fiscal 1990 and components that could be used for five additional planes 
scheduled for inclusion in the fiscal 1991 budget.

Lane Kirkland, the 67-year-old president of the AFL-CIO, was unanimously 
reelected Wednesday to a sixth two-year term by 765 delegates to organized 
labor's biannual convention. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers Union, which reaffiliated 
with the AFL-CIO last summer after a four-decade absence, was elected to one of 
five open vice presidential seats on the AFL-CIO executive council. 
</P>
<P>
Latino delegates to the convention expressed disgruntlement that a Latino labor 
leader, Jack Otero, vice president of the Transportation Communication 
International Union, was not among those named to the 33-member council. 
</P>
<P>
The executive council has no Latinos, only three women and two blacks, a fact 
that irks minorities, who note that women and minorities are the prime targets 
of current union organizing efforts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed. It's inconceivable to me that if you have 1.4 million 
Latino members affiliated with the AFL-CIO you can't find one to sit on the 
executive council," said Rick Icaza, president of the Los Angeles County 
Federation of Labor and a delegate to the convention. Kirkland "has to 
realistically sit down and encourage the executive council that the time is 
now."

An outbreak of lead poisoning in Dutch and British cows is under control, and 
all precautions have been taken to stop their milk and meat from endangering 
people, a European Community official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Common Market, which launched an investigation last week, decided 
it was not necessary to declare an alert. 
</P>
<P>
Cows on about 1,700 farms in the Netherlands and Britain were poisoned earlier 
this month after eating food pellets contaminated with lead. The problem is 
believed to have been caused by a consignment of rice bran contaminated while 
enroute to Antwerp from Burma in September.

A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school 
Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many 
others in their cars and homes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and 
shopping areas," said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched 
down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in this northeastern Alabama city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Steve Hettinger said 14 deaths had been confirmed, with 285 people 
injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while city streets 
were filled with rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Guy Hunt, at the state's disaster center in Montgomery, said rescue teams 
with cranes and floodlights would search the rubble through the night for 
injured or dead. "It may be tomorrow before we have a final count," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said 50 National Guard troops were dispatched to the city, along 
with search and rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford 
Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by 
the tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing left standing was a door frame," news photographer Mike Mercier 
said of the school, which was empty of staff and pupils when the tornado hit. 
Police reported one person killed in a car outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square apartments, 
three at a business school, Southern Junior College, which is located in a 
converted movie theater, and others in scattered areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Rescuers are digging in the rubble," state trooper W. L. Kelly said. He said 
two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east 
of Huntsville. The fifth death was reported near the shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
"We've called in troopers from around the state to help," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone 
Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons 
testing center. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the tornadoes and 
WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting, reported widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started 
shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of," said real estate 
broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It started picking cars up and pushing them around . . . some of them upside 
down, some of them just strewn around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy overhead power lines "started snapping just like a circus performer would 
snap his whip," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping 
over the top of us . . . it was as if you were looking into an arc-welder, they 
were so bright," he said. 
</P>
<P>
WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed 
from winds that overturned cars in the area. A nearby shopping center also was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors were having difficulty 
reaching the hospital because of blocked roads. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east Alabama hamlet 
of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one home and causing some 
injuries. Weather officials said people were trapped inside a collapsed house. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said people were injured 
at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of Sylacauga. 
</P>
<P>
Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather swept across 
much of Alabama and the National Weather Service placed most of the state under 
a tornado watch. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, after a tornado struck 
two mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto.

NEW GENETIC GRAFT EASES SYMPTOMS IN RATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego researchers report that they can alleviate the symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease in rats by grafting genetically engineered skin cells into 
the animals' brains. 
</P>
<P>
Their technique may drastically reduce some of the ethical difficulties 
associated with a controversial new therapy for the disease that involves 
grafting brain cells from aborted fetuses into the brains of Parkinson's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's is caused by the death of brain cells that secrete the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays a key role in the control of muscle 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to replace the lost dopamine, surgeons have grafted both tissue 
from the adrenal glands, which also secrete dopamine, and brain tissue from 
aborted fetuses into the brains of about 300 Parkinson's victims. 
</P>
<P>
But grafting adrenal tissue requires two operations -- one to remove the tissue 
from its normal location over the kidney and one to implant it -- and the use 
of fetal tissue has become inextricably entwined with the debate over abortion. 
Federal rules now prevent the use of fetal tissue in government-funded research 
or therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Neuroscientist Fred H. Gage and his colleagues at UCSD have circumvented these 
problems by genetically altering rat skin cells so that they secrete dopamine, 
then implanting the cells into the brains of rats in which dopamine-secreting 
brain cells had been destroyed. Because the cells were destroyed on only one 
side of the brain, the rats' muscle control was impaired on one side of their 
body and they walked in circles. 
</P>
<P>
Gage and his colleagues reported in the latest Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences that the genetically engineered cells reduced the 
Parkinson-like symptoms by 40%. The altered cells are "nowhere near as 
effective as fetal cells," Gage said, but he believes that their efficacy can 
be greatly improved. Most important, he added, the approach offers a "viable 
alternative" to the use of fetal cells.

MENTAL ILLNESS THEORY -- STUDY RAISES DOUBTS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: NEW RESEARCH CANNOT SUPPORT PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED GENETIC LINKS TO TWO 
SERIOUS FORMS OF DISEASE -- MANIC-DEPRESSION AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
New research has raised serious doubts about previously proposed genetic 
linkages to two serious forms of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the National Institute of Mental Health and UC San Diego 
report in today's Nature that they were unable to confirm previous data linking 
manic-depressive illness -- which causes as many as 2 million Americans to 
experience radical mood swings between elation and depression -- to a faulty 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also not been able to reproduce British studies demonstrating 
a link between a gene on chromosome 5 and schizophrenia, which affects one in 
every 100 people by causing hallucinations and delusions and inappropriate 
emotional responses. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to confirm these earlier studies, neuroscientists say, indicates 
the great difficulty of determining a precise cause for such complex and 
variable diseases as the many forms of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
But even though an editorial in the same issue of Nature says, "This leaves us 
with no persuasive evidence linking any psychiatric disease to a single 
(gene)," some geneticists are undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
Belief Is Still Firm 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, we still believe strongly that mental illness has a very, very 
strong genetic component," said Steven M. Paul of the NIMH, one of the authors 
of the new study. "We just haven't found the genes yet." Paul and others say 
their work actually suggests that many types of mental illness may be caused by 
more than one gene. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to locate such genes, the NIMH is currently beginning a major 
study, at 10 U.S. medical centers, of families with a history of 
manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Although he called the failure to confirm the earlier findings "depressing," 
geneticist Kenneth Kidd of Yale University noted that "they are injecting a 
healthy dose of reality into the field." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd said that because of the initial, apparent ease with which researchers had 
linked manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia to genes, "virtually every 
psychiatric department in the country is trying to set up a DNA laboratory to 
do these kinds of studies." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the pendulum is swinging back to the middle ground as researchers 
are learning that "it is going to take a lot of effort" to find the genes. 
</P>
<P>
The original study linking manic-depressive illness to a faulty gene, reported 
in February, 1987, was conducted among the 12,000 members of the Old Order 
Amish community in Lancaster County, Pa. All are descended from 15 to 25 
couples who emigrated from Europe in the early 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Manic-depressive illness is no more common in the Amish than in the general 
population. But the large family size, clearly established paternity, and 
social and religious prohibitions against use of drugs and alcohol in the 
community make it an ideal place to study hereditary factors in genetic 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
In the original study, psychiatrist Janice A. Egeland of the University of 
Miami School of Medicine and her colleagues studied DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, 
the genetic blueprint of humans) from an Amish family with 81 members, 19 of 
whom had manic-depressive illness. They found that all 19 affected individuals 
had an identical stretch of DNA on the short end of chromosome 11, one of the 
46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in which all genetic information is concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
They did not, however, identify a specific gene that causes the illness. 
</P>
<P>
In work that led to the new study, Paul and his colleagues were studying a gene 
that had previously been linked indirectly to depression and, possibly, to 
mania. The researchers wanted to find out whether a defective form of the gene 
might be present in the Amish individuals with manic-depressive illness, but 
the first few individuals whose cells they studied did not have the gene they 
were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Because no other research group had been able to find families that share this 
same genetic defect, this finding persuaded them to restudy the whole group. 
</P>
<P>
But when they did so, they found that the family "had changed in several ways," 
said neurogeneticist John R. Kelsoe of UCSD, who wrote the Nature paper along 
with Paul and others. Most important, he said, two individuals who had been 
healthy at the time of the earlier study had now developed manic-depressive 
illness -- and these individuals did not have the stretch of DNA shared by the 
19 other affected members. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporating these changed diagnoses into the original study "does not 
eliminate the evidence for a genetic linkage, but it reduces it below the level 
of statistical significance," said Kidd, who also participated in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also studied a set of 31 extended family members, eight of whom 
have manic-depressive disease or related illnesses, who hadn't been included in 
the original study and found no evidence at all for the linkage to chromosome 
11 in this group, making the original conclusion weaker still. 
</P>
<P>
The group is now studying two hypotheses, Kelsoe said. One is that the original 
linkage was "a false positive, not an error, but a statistical error," he said. 
The second, and perhaps more likely, hypothesis is that more than one gene can 
cause the disease. In fact, researchers have always argued that mental 
illnesses, with their great variability, are probably caused by more than one 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the latter view is found in the fact that the 30 extended family 
members share a common ancestor, a Mennonite woman who married into an Amish 
family 100 years ago and who suffered from some form of mental illness. It is 
possible, Kelsoe said, that her illness was caused by a second gene and that 
the presence of that gene in the family has complicated the interpretation of 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
Reports at recent meetings suggest that the problem with the putative 
schizophrenia gene is more severe. Psychiatrist Hugh Gurling of the University 
of London and his colleagues reported last November that they had studied seven 
British and Icelandic families in which 39 of the 104 family members had the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
They reported that the suspected schizophrenia gene seemed to lie between two 
well-known genes on chromosome 5. Unfortunately, researchers in five other 
laboratories have since reported that they have been unable to find the link to 
these two genes in other families. 
</P>
<P>
Gurling has also not been able to provide other researchers with DNA from the 
families he studied, so no one has been able to attempt to replicate his 
results. "The burden of proof is on Hugh now," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Lewis Judd, director of the NIMH, said the new evidence about both 
putative genes is "very disappointing." But, referring specifically to the 
manic-depressive study, he said, "It doesn't mean that there isn't a gene 
present. It just means that the likelihood of it being on chromosome 11 is 
significantly diminished."

JURY DOESN'T BELIEVE DEFENDANT'S STORIES OF SHOOTING, CONVICTS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso was convicted Wednesday of attempted first-degree murder 
and conspiracy in the shooting of Santa Ana nightclub financier William 
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction could have implications for Los Angeles racketeer Michael 
Anthony Rizzitello, who is scheduled to go on trial for the Carroll shooting 
Dec. 11. Prosecutors charge that Rizzitello, with Grosso's help, shot Carroll 
after Rizzitello had made an unsuccessful attempt to take over the now-defunct 
Mustang Club, a topless bar in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Both Grosso and Carroll testified that it was Rizzitello -- listed by the state 
attorney general's office as an underboss in the Los Angeles-based Milano crime 
family -- who pulled the trigger in the 1987 shooting that left Carroll blind. 
Carroll, 56, said that Grosso, 46, held him down to prevent his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello, 62, has denied through his attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, that he 
participated in the Carroll shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Kathleen Bruck of Costa Mesa said the jurors believed Carroll's 
testimony that Rizzitello was the man who shot him and that Grosso was a 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso testified that he did not know that Rizzitello was going to shoot 
Carroll, after the three had dinner together. Grosso predicted that he will be 
killed because he testified against Rizzitello. The two are being held in 
separate sections of the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Grosso also admitted that he had told "probably more than 
25" different versions about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to show the jurors that Mr. Grosso had to tell different stories 
about what happened to protect himself from being killed," said Grosso's 
attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr. "But obviously they did not accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, who faces an automatic sentence of 25 years to life in prison, was 
found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted first-degree murder, and 
mayhem. Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. set a Dec. 12 sentencing date.

CRITIC AT LARGE: 'THIRD GENIUS' APPLAUDS WIT OF HAROLD LLOYD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He came out of thin times in Nebraska and joined a touring theater company, 
determined to be a serious dramatic actor. He landed in the dusty, hand-cranked 
Hollywood of 1912 and chased jobs as a Western extra alongside a new pal named 
Hal Roach. 
</P>
<P>
More than Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, both of whom had grown up in 
vaudeville, Harold Lloyd was an accidental comedian. But in the end, he made 
more films than both of them together and, as Kevin Brownlow and David Gill 
amply prove in a two-part "American Masters" profile that commences tonight at 
8 on Channel 28, Lloyd had a gift for physical comedy that was probably the 
equal of Keaton's. 
</P>
<P>
"Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius" was produced jointly by Thames Television in 
London, WNET in New York and the Harold Lloyd Estate, which explains its 
remarkable trove of clips and memorabilia (including posters from Lloyd's stock 
company days). 
</P>
<P>
There is a glimpse of Lloyd in Indian garb in what was apparently his first 
appearance on camera. The heart of the first installment of the profile is 
extended clips from what is undoubtedly Lloyd's most famous film, "Safety Last" 
(1923), in which he hangs from the hands of a clock on an office building high 
above Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Using rare production stills, Brownlow and Gill rather naughtily reveal how the 
illusion was created that Lloyd was hanging in space. At that, the stunt was 
far from danger-free, although a building set-back allowed Lloyd no worse than 
a short fall and gave the camera a position from which it seemed to look only 
into several stories of space. 
</P>
<P>
Illusion or not, it remains a white-knuckle spectacle and seeing it for the 
dozenth time (or more), you realize how ingeniously Lloyd and his writers 
extended the central joke with sub-gags, including a mouse that invades his 
pant leg while he is clinging to a ledge, and further including a flagpole that 
bends like a willow branch. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd did not come at once to a character like Chaplin's Tramp or Keaton's 
gloomily impassive loser in the porkpie hat. When Roach came into some money 
and started producing and directing shorts, he and Lloyd created Willie Work, 
who or which was not a success. They did better, after Lloyd had briefly left 
for a stint with Mack Sennett, with a new character called Lonesome Luke, quite 
derivative of Chaplin's Tramp. 
</P>
<P>
Then Roach and Lloyd came up with the character that stuck: straw boater, 
blazer, scholarly black-rimmed glasses, saddle shoes; Lloyd was the very model 
of Joe Freshman, or perhaps an apprentice bank clerk on a Sunday outing, or an 
early day Clark Kent who had no cape and tights to change into. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Chaplin was still the originating impulse: the new Lloyd was still 
the little guy, not quite so far down the economic ladder as Charlie but 
nevertheless an average guy who is not always a loser. Through wit, chutzpah 
and courage, and some truly spectacular physical feats, Lloyd wins the girl and 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
His physical feats were the more amazing because he had lost part of a hand 
when he picked up a prop bomb to examine it and it exploded. He wore a glove to 
conceal the missing fingers and was still able to scale buildings and scare the 
pants off his audiences, even as they laughed hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who eventually had his own unit at Paramount, kept working into the 
sound era. But his last film, "Mad Wednesday" (first called "The Sin of Harold 
Diddlebock"), produced by Howard Hughes and written and directed by Preston 
Sturges in 1947, was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Like Chaplin but unlike Keaton, Lloyd was a smart businessman who kept title to 
his work and enjoyed the income from its re-releases. Brownlow and Gill include 
some footage of Lloyd talking about his art at film gatherings in the '60s. He 
died in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
There are interviews with admirers such as Jack Lemmon and Roddy McDowall, and 
with some surviving associates, including the extraordinary Hal Roach himself, 
now 98. 
</P>
<P>
Director Lindsay Anderson does the narration. 
</P>
<P>
Watching "Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius" is to be reminded that Lloyd was 
indeed a genius at making comedy: "constructing each scene as carefully as 
though it were the mainspring of a watch," Robert E. Sherwood wrote of him in 
1923. 
</P>
<P>
But watching is to be reminded in a larger way of what a rich and amazing art 
form silent comedy was. "Silence," says the film historian David Shipman, 
"created the movie clowns, from Max Linder forward. If movies had talked from 
the beginning, their physical action might have been confined to what was 
possible behind a proscenium arch." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the action reached dizzying heights.

KCSN SWITCHES FROM COUNTRY TO CLASSICAL FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to the recent shake-ups among classical music stations in Los 
Angeles, KCSN-FM (88.5), a tiny public radio station licensed to Cal State 
Northridge, switched formats Wednesday from country music to classical music. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity in the marketplace obviously is the reason for the change," 
KCSN General Manager Ken Mills said. "There are very few windows of opportunity 
such as this for a small public station to take on a major format. The recent 
demise of KFAC (which changed to a rock format) and the fine-tuning and 
fluctuations at KUSC (91.5) have made it possible for us to consider -- and now 
do -- a classical format." 
</P>
<P>
KCSN made the switch to classical music at 1:05 p.m. Wednesday with the playing 
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
KCSN serves a 25-mile area that covers most of the San Fernando and Santa 
Clarita valleys, and Mills said he is considering attempting to expand the 
station's signal power.

RICK DU BROW: FNN BIDS FOR RATINGS WITH ITS AUCTION NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alliance between art and commerce took a novel TV twist Tuesday when 
cable's Financial News Network presented a live broadcast of the New York 
auction at which a painting by Edouard Manet sold for $26.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Live from the auction floor of Christie's," enthused an announcer as though he 
were introducing the Super Bowl, "the sale of 14 masterpieces collected by Paul 
Mellon. You'll have front-row seats for one of the biggest nights in auction 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Television has a way of turning everything into television, and this was no 
different. At one point before the bidding began, co-host Walter Maibaum asked 
auctioneer Christopher Burge the eternal TV question: "How do you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
"Excited on the one hand, nervous on the other," Burge replied. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was presented as a special edition of an FNN series, "The Art 
Market Report." It was broadcast, FNN vice president Jim Lucas said, "because 
the art market is hot." Lucas said that FNN had put on one other live art 
auction -- of Andy Warhol works: "We obviously want to pick high visibility 
auctions for coverage." 
</P>
<P>
This was not a PBS presentation. The brief glimpses of the art itself got much 
less air time than the flood of commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The focus was more on the auction than a history of the art works, given the 
nature of the event. And there was an undeniable fascination in watching the 
elegant Burge -- who looks a bit like Michael Caine -- roll off the incredible 
bidding for the 1878 Manet painting, "La Rue Mosnier With Flags," which was 
sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"$12 million . . . $16 million . . . $21 million . . . $23 million. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And finally upward to the winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast was sent to FNN's estimated 33 million viewers on 3,500 cable 
systems in the United States and Canada. FNN says its viewers are "typically 
affluent, educated, 35-64 years of age and are interested in making the most of 
their money." 
</P>
<P>
Their mouths must have watered watching the Christie's auction. But FNN felt 
compelled for some reason to present the event with the same old TV format used 
for everything from sports to politics. Hosts Maibaum and Susie Gharib presided 
at a desk like a couple of news anchors, and there was even a floor reporter -- 
which might have been a good idea since that's where the action was. 
</P>
<P>
But typical TV audio problems from the jam-packed floor fouled up some of the 
best parts of the program -- the analyses of art experts. Somehow, Manet, Van 
Gogh and Picasso seemed worth a more settled discussion than the 
commercial-strewn remarks emanating from a format better suited to interviewing 
an on-the-run congressman at a political convention. 
</P>
<P>
FNN failed, strangely, to capture the apparent excitement on the floor. Maibaum 
improved after he launched into analysis, a distinct step up from his gee-whiz 
tone earlier. At times, the questioning of Burge was somehow reminiscent of how 
Fred Roggin might talk to Jim Everett or Todd Marinovich on the eve of a big 
game. 
</P>
<P>
What this program needed as host was a Clifton Webb or a George Sanders. Or, 
since they're dead, an Alistair Cooke.

THIS VOCAL QUINTET DEFINITELY HAS A NEW YORK STATE OF MIND; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: NEW YORK VOICES TACKLES MUSIC RANGING FROM JOHN COLTRANE TO ARETHA 
FRANKLIN, WHICH IS JUST FINE WITH ITS LEADER.

<TEXT>
<P>
New York Voices, the quintet playing at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood 
through Sunday, has lofty ambitions. Sure, the singers interpret jazz classics 
from Monk's "Round Midnight" to Ellington's "Caravan." Granted, they mixed Bach 
with bossa in the wordless "Baroque Samba" and have dipped into pop with words 
to the Yellowjackets' "Top Secret." 
</P>
<P>
Can they have it both ways? Which audience are they aiming at? Why do their 
lyrics range from socially significant ("National Amnesia") to utterly bland 
("Come Home")? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Darmon Meader, the group's leader. As composer and arranger of much of 
their material, vocal improviser and saxophonist, he plays a significant role 
in determining the quintet's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have different backgrounds," he said. "Consequently you hear various 
influences and styles at work. I'm at one extreme with my experience as a jazz 
instrumentalist. Caprice Fox has done a lot of R&amp;B, also some workshops 
with Bobby McFerrin. Peter Eldridge had classical training, but his background 
is ridiculously wide, from early classics up to rock 'n' roll. Kim Nazarian and 
Sara Krieger both have had theatrical experience. You add those up and you kind 
of get what we do." 
</P>
<P>
The fivesome is logically named. All the members except Krieger studied at 
Ithaca College in Upstate New York. In the summer of 1986, the school was 
invited to take an alumni vocal unit to play at such European events as the 
North Sea Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I was well prepared. For a few years after graduating I'd done resort gigs and 
explored the vocal jazz idiom as a performer and writer," said Meader. "We were 
a big hit in Europe, and back home, four of the six of us decided to form a 
similar group. We needed one more female voice, and Sara, who had been doing 
her own thing in New York City for 10 years, joined us in the fall of '87." 
</P>
<P>
A contract with GRP Records set the quintet on the road to public awareness. 
Their first album, released last May, has moved slowly but surely up to the Top 
10 on the Billboard jazz chart; meanwhile, as calls for dates improved, the 
quintet went to Europe last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The Berlin Jazz Festival was a great experience," said Meader. "We'd been 
accustomed to playing mostly smaller clubs, so it was nice to be part of 
something on a grand scale, at the Philharmonic, along with people like Mel 
Torme and Abbey Lincoln. The reception over there is amazing. They can be very 
demanding and very critical, but when they like you it's truly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the precedent-setting Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross trio, New York 
Voices generally avoids the customary practice of setting words to what were 
originally recorded jazz solos. In "Caravan," for example, Meader has a long 
improvised passage that resembles just such a solo, though in fact he devised 
the melody himself. 
</P>
<P>
"As a saxophone player I base some of the writing on my own improvisational 
style," he said. "We don't want to duplicate what Manhattan Transfer did on the 
'Vocalese' album." 
</P>
<P>
New York Voices is evidently finding its own avenue to success. New 
arrangements include John Coltrane's "Giant Steps," Tadd Dameron's "Lady Bird" 
and Aretha Franklin's "Chain of Fools." 
</P>
<P>
Are they or are they not a jazz group at heart? The answer can be found in 
those titles: Jazz, it would seem, is a New York vocal state of mind.

COURTS: ATTORNEY DID NOT PROVE PARALYZED WOMAN IN NURSING HOME SUFFERED DAMAGE, 
JUDGE RULES. HOSPITAL STAFF FOUND NOT TO BE NEGLIGENT.

<P>
A judge Wednesday set aside a $7.5-million jury award to a paralyzed woman who 
became pregnant after being raped at a North Hollywood nursing home, ruling 
that the woman's attorney did not prove that she suffered damage from the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter also found insufficient 
evidence to support the jury's verdict that negligence by the staff of the 
Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital led to the rape of Andrea Nerpel, 38, who had 
lived there since suffering major brain damage in a car accident when she was 
19. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no basis for the jury's finding other than mere speculation, 
sympathy, or compassion," Schacter said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are aware that a terrible wrong was done to Andrea Nerpel by an 
unknown person. Any rational person would have feelings of sympathy for the 
plaintiff, and disgust and rage against the unknown perpetrator. However, 
vengeance on the nursing home, which is the apparent basis for the jury 
verdict, is not the solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel's family sued the nursing home for negligence on her behalf and a jury 
awarded her $7.5 million in damages after a month-long trial. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to move or communicate meaningfully since the 1969 accident, Nerpel 
became pregnant in 1982. Her grandmother, Elian Rose, learned of the pregnancy 
about three months later during a visit to the nursing home. Nerpel, who is fed 
through a tube in her stomach, had an abortion and was sterilized. The rapist 
was never identified. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, the family's attorney, Alan J. Schultz, said the 
cost-conscious nursing home did not provide security for its patients. He urged 
them to punish the nursing home's parent corporation, Western Medical 
Enterprises Inc., by granting Nerpel substantial damages. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision to overturn the verdict, Schacter chastised Schultz for 
failing to produce evidence to support his contentions that the nursing home -- 
where Nerpel continues to live -- was negligent in caring for the patients, 
hiring reliable employees, or maintaining security on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
The judge called Schultz's closing argument "inflammatory" and said it violated 
the judge's earlier order that he not ask for punitive damages. He also said 
Schultz offered no evidence that Nerpel suffered damage as a result of the 
incident. During the trial, nursing home attorney Richard B. Castle argued that 
Nerpel was totally unaware of her surroundings and did not know she had been 
raped. 
</P>
<P>
"Even her grandmother admitted she did not know if Miss Nerpel knew or was 
aware what had happened to her, either at the time of the sexual activity or 
later," Schacter said. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.

AVALON IS WHERE THIS PRINCE'S HEART IS, AFTER ALL

<P>
In the end, he couldn't bring himself to leave island life behind. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince, who submitted his resignation last weekend, 
on Wednesday announced he changed his mind -- as surprised city officials 
abruptly called off their search for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Prince had already taken a job as redevelopment manager for the 
city of South Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to not being able to leave the island," Prince said. "I've become 
accustomed to this place much quicker than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials said they were delighted that Prince, 34, is remaining on Santa 
Catalina Island, where he had been Avalon's city manager for less than a year 
but had quickly won over the tight-knit community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with Mr. Prince," said Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith, who had 
already telephoned five job finalists to find a new candidate for the 
$62,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, South Lake Tahoe officials were less pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really left shocked and breathless," said South Lake Tahoe City Manager 
Kerry Miller. "This leaves us in a publicly embarassing situation." 
</P>
<P>
Prince, who is from Northern California, said the South Lake Tahoe offer 
attracted him because it "was an opportunity to return to that part of the 
state. But when you balance that off against Catalina, Catalina wins." ADRIANNE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSFER OF WELFARE RECIPIENTS PROTESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood residents are protesting a county decision to send thousands of 
welfare recipients to an office in their city to relieve overcrowding at 
another county office. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the Inglewood welfare facility will serve about 12,000 people 
a month. Residents who live near it have gathered more than 250 signatures 
protesting its use. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering when it housed a full-service welfare office in the early 1980s, 
Grace Randall, who lives across the street, said, "Last time that thing was 
there we had dirty diapers and beer bottles everywhere. Who's going to pick 
those up?"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMTRAK REJECTS BOOST IN L.A.-SAN DIEGO RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top Amtrak officials said Wednesday that they cannot afford to add trains on 
the Los Angeles-San Diego rail corridor, the nation's second-busiest passenger 
route, or replace aging signal equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In a Washington meeting, Amtrak officials said they might not have enough money 
this year to cover existing service, much less the expense of adding trains or 
making system improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The news was a setback for the Los Angeles-San Diego Rail Corridor Agency, 
formed by the state and Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. The agency 
had hoped to persuade Amtrak to begin work on an estimated $15 million in 
signal improvements and to provide additional train service along the busy 
route.

REDONDO BEACH IS TAKING A NEW INTEREST IN ITS OLD-TIME BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paint is peeling. The porches droop. Even their biggest advocate says 
they're "ratty." Parked in a poplar grove in Redondo Beach, the two old houses 
are so forlorn that to many they seemed landmarks only an architectural scholar 
could love. 
</P>
<P>
But love works in strange and manifold ways, the South Bay's oldest city is 
discovering. Since last year, when the vintage homes were moved to make way for 
condominiums, their planned restoration has drawn an unexpected flood of 
volunteers -- ranging from bikers to Girl Scouts to Bhagavan Sri Babajhan 
Al-Kahlil The Friend, a 46-year-old yogi from Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
"They're literally coming out of the woodwork," marveled Jonathan Eubanks, 
president of the Redondo Beach Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
In a place where soaring property values have meant the demise of historic 
homes, such grass-roots rediscoveries of the past are gaining popularity. Like 
many cities, Redondo Beach is acquiring a renewed appreciation of its heritage, 
preservationists say. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, homeowners in Redondo Beach have gotten a neighborhood 
-- the 300 block of North Gertruda Avenue -- into the National Register of 
Historic Places. Another, the 500 block of Garnet Street, is seeking city 
designation as a local historic district. And this summer, after a five-year 
battle, the City Council created a new Preservation Commission to oversee the 
fate of the city's dwindling stock of older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
To Eubanks, the new interest in restoration and the outpouring of volunteers to 
work on the two vintage homes has been a relief. Their restoration is expected 
to cost up to $350,000, and the Historical Society, which has promised to carry 
it out, has less than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach is not the only place where some people are concerned about 
"merging into the megalopolis with no local character left at all," said Jay 
Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy. In recent years, he 
said, Long Beach and Riverside have created positions for city preservation 
officers and West Hollywood has passed a "very advanced, very strong" historic 
resources ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, he said, the move follows a building boom of the sort that in 
Redondo Beach has obliterated numerous old bungalows, theaters and other 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our whole downtown to urban renewal in the 1950s and early 1960s," 
Eubanks said. "For years, Redondo Beach has been so developed in so many ways. 
Now people are saying, 'Wait a minute -- where did my community go?' " 
</P>
<P>
For Eubanks, that question today focuses on the two turn-of-the-century houses 
transplanted to the city's Dominguez Park. The clapboard homes came to the 
city's attention last year because one, the Morrell House, was standing in the 
way of development. 
</P>
<P>
High on a hill at 204 N. Catalina Ave., with a big wrap-around porch 
overlooking the harbor, the house had been built by J. Edward Morrell, one of 
the 97-year-old city's first construction magnates. With Queen Anne style and 
Craftsman detailing, it is among the city's oldest homes and continued to color 
local lore long after the Morrell family moved on to Santa Barbara in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
For 14 years, an ancient form of yoga was taught there by Bhagavan Sri Babajhan 
Al-Kahlil The Friend, known as Bhagavan for short. 
</P>
<P>
The group was evicted in 1984 after the property changed hands. For about a 
year, the house sat vacant, at the mercy of vandals. By the time Terry Ison, 
the next -- and last -- tenant moved in, the walls were marred by punk 
graffiti. The carpeting was ripped, the screen doors were gone and the big 
porch railing was so rotten that Ison's friends used pieces of it for firewood. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, property owner Simon Chang decided he wanted condominiums there. 
Lobbied by the Historical Society, the City Council voted to move the house to 
a park where it would create a living museum of local buildings to be preserved 
for their historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Morrell House sits on cribbing at Dominguez Park, along with a modest 
Victorian cottage of the Queen Anne style that also was forced out by 
condominium development. The city has spent more than $300,000 to move and 
landscape the homes. But officials worry that the Historical Society won't be 
able to keep its pledge to restore them for up to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of money for a nonprofit corporation that produces most of its 
money from bake sales and the like," City Manager Tim Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
But Eubanks, who admits that the houses are "pretty ratty," says the work can 
be stretched over several years' worth of fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Eubanks sees more in the outpouring of support than the popularity of an old 
house. The volunteers -- 150 so far -- include everyone from housewives to 
engineers to King Harbor Neighborhood Girl Scout Troop No. 1344, whose leader 
is Linda Rummler. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to get her troop involved in volunteer service was only part of the 
reason she signed up, Rummler said. The other part was that "people are getting 
sick and tired of these condos overloading our community."

CHURCH NOT COWED BY INCIDENTS OF VANDALISM; 
</P>
<P>
MINISTER VOWS TO CONTINUE TRADITION OF HAVING CHAPEL OPEN FOR PRAYER, 
MEDITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At lunchtime Wednesday, the free weekly organ concert began on time at the 
venerable Immanuel Presbyterian Church on Wilshire Boulevard. And Immanuel's 
Chichester Chapel remained one of Los Angeles' few houses of worship open daily 
for public prayer and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
It was business as usual despite the fact that vandals had hammered holes in 
two of the chapel's stained glass windows late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Seated at the church's 400-pipe organ before a crowd ranging from architects in 
stylish business suits to a homeless man in a Hawaiian shirt, organist Joy 
Schappell launched into five sonatas and hymns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the vestibule outside, the Rev. Gary A. Wilburn asserted that 
nothing will prevent Immanuel from continuing its weekly Wednesday noon 
community concerts, its multitude of prayer services or the continued daily 
opening of its Chichester Chapel where the vandalism took place. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are shocked and disappointed by this incident," Wilburn said. "We 
shall continue to keep the chapel open and renew our commitment to the 
community to have this center for prayer, meditation and relaxation available 
for all of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much loneliness and alienation in the city. I want the church to 
remain a refuge." 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism occurred shortly before the chapel was to be locked for the 
evening at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. Vandals tore two brass-plated candlesticks from 
an altar and used them to smash three holes in two stained-glass windows. The 
vandals also punched holes in another window and stole a six-foot pew cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police, estimating the damage at more than $5,000, had no immediate 
suspects or witnesses. Church officials, who said they could not recall any 
recent threats, predicted that repairs will cost more than twice what the 
police estimated. They added that they will install security measures to 
prevent further damage to the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two colorful windows that was damaged depicts Jesus raising a girl 
from the dead. The other shows Christ telling a rich young ruler to distribute 
funds to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that (the latter) was one of the windows to be smashed," Wilburn 
said, speculating the attacker was likely a person "pushed to the fringe 
because of the inability of our culture to include them." 
</P>
<P>
"I have empathy for the person who did this," he said. "He must be going 
through his own hell." 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism was the second such incident this month in the Chichester Chapel, 
which attracts about 800 visitors a week, according to church business 
administrator Anna May. In the other incident, excrement was smeared over an 
American flag, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The church, located on Wilshire Boulevard near Vermont Avenue since 1929, 
serves a congregation ranging from Hancock Park to the homeless. More than 27 
nationalities are represented among Immanuel's 500 member families, church 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the church's multicultural, multiracial aspects more in evidence 
than at the free lunchtime organ concerts. About 60 people attended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Sanchez, a health insurance administrator for Thrifty Corp., regularly 
attends the weekly concerts during his lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just nice to see a church that is so old," he said. "I just wish other 
churches along Wilshire would open too." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Thomas Cotton, a temporarily homeless musician, was attending his first 
noontime concert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing. It's a change from being in downtown Los Angeles' Skid Row," 
said Cotton, who occasionally participates in Immanuel's free lunch program. 
"And I love organ music. It goes straight to the soul."

BURNED BODY IN STREET IS IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF MISSING LANDLORD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE RANCHO PALOS VERDES RESIDENT SET OUT TO COLLECT RENT FROM DELINQUENT 
TENANTS. HE NEVER RETURNED. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles police said Wednesday they had found the badly burned body of a 
Vietnamese-American landlord who disappeared last week as he left his Rancho 
Palos Verdes home to collect rent from delinquent tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The body of John Long, 53, was discovered Nov. 8 lying in a street near 91st 
Street and Stanmore Drive in Westchester, about five miles from the 10-unit 
Hawthorne apartment building he has owned since last year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said the body was discovered only eight hours 
after Long vanished, but that the coroner's office was unable to positively 
identify it until Wednesday because it had been "severely and extensively 
burned." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no suspects and few leads in Long's death. They could not 
explain how he died. 
</P>
<P>
Long's wife, Kimchi, said she last saw her husband at about 1 p.m. on the day 
he disappeared, when he left for the Hawthorne apartment building in his beige 
1980 Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Long vanished, a passer-by found the car abandoned and ransacked 
near 53rd Street and Central Avenue in Southeast Los Angeles. Scattered inside 
the car were Long's business papers and the rosary beads that Long, a Catholic, 
always carried. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide investigators, who handled the case while 
Long was still missing, said he was last seen by his wife headed for one of the 
two English-style townhouse apartment buildings he owned on Truro Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kimchi and Long's friends, the landlord visited the apartments 
frequently because some of the tenants owed him as much as $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her concerns for his safety, Kimchi Long said her husband always made 
sure he collected the rent personally, driving into a dangerous neighborhood 
where drug dealing and prostitution purportedly was common. 
</P>
<P>
Although the buildings appear to be well-maintained, residents and neighbors 
said that on most evenings, a host of drug dealers operate in an alley behind 
the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that area is not the best area," Kimchi Long, 40, said in an interview 
before her husband's body was discovered. "I did mention it to him. He told me 
not to worry about it. He said, 'I'm very nice to them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Long's tenants agreed that their landlord was a likable man who has taken good 
care of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon Young, a 40-year-old school teacher, said he considered Long his friend. 
"He was a nice guy, but I don't think he should be collecting rent. It's 
dangerous," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Young said, some residents had run-ins with the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"People had differences of opinion with him because of certain things he did," 
Young recalled. "He came knocking on the door a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Young and another renter said that on the afternoon of Long's disappearance, 
they saw the landlord arrive and walk toward an alley behind the building. They 
said Long returned to his car a few minutes later and drove off alone. 
</P>
<P>
Long had been scheduled to visit a third building he owned in Hawthorne to show 
a vacant apartment to a prospective tenant, said Jerry Callahan, Long's 
next-door neighbor and friend. But Callahan said it was not clear whether Long 
ever arrived for the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Kimchi Long, who had been living with her husband and 12-year-old son, Michael, 
in Rancho Palos Verdes, recalled the day of her husband's disappearance with 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
She became concerned when her husband did not return home for dinner, she said, 
and by midnight she began to telephone police and local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't call, so I thought maybe he was stuck in traffic," she said. "After 
10, I started worrying and my son started asking me, 'Where's daddy?' " 
</P>
<P>
After Long's disappearance, Callahan, an attorney, served eviction notices on 
two tenants of the Truro Avenue apartment building who, he said, are thousands 
of dollars behind on their rent. Callahan also said he intends to serve 
eviction notices on other delinquent tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan described Long as a clever businessman and investor, but not 
thick-skinned enough to be a good landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has a very soft heart," Callahan said. "(The tenants) take 
advantage of him. They say they don't have money and he believes them." 
</P>
<P>
Kimchi Long said that when she asked her husband why the tenants were 
frequently late with the rent, he answered: "Oh, they are very poor. Just give 
them a chance." 
</P>

Long arrived in the United States from Vietnam in the 1960s and later became a 
naturalized citizen and received training at De Paul University in Chicago as 
an electrical engineer. At the time of his disappearance, Long was working as 
an independent real estate broker out of his home. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in recent years that Long began to invest in apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said they were preparing to launch a door-to-door search for 
the missing landlord when they were informed that Long's body had been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
In a strange twist, authorities later announced they had mistakenly identified 
a second body found near the airport as that of the missing landlord. That body 
was discovered Wednesday by LAPD officers but it turned out to be that of a 
74-year-old resident of an apartment building who had died of natural causes.

CHANGING WORKPLACE; 
</P>
<P>
A FLEXIBLE SPACE WHERE IDEAS FLOW RAPIDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Something's happening at the office -- something's happening to the office. 
Experts in disciplines ranging from artificial intelligence to interior design 
are rethinking how, when, why and where we work. Although their viewpoints and 
forecasts differ, all agree with Washington strategic planner Maree S. Forbes 
that "the rate of change in the U.S. workplace is unprecedented in our history 
and will touch us all." Times staff writer Connie Koenenn interviews four of 
the nation's top thinkers on work-space design. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan B. Sutherland thinks the American office will undergo unprecedented 
change in the next decade, and offers two quick reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
"On a humanistic level, most people are working in unsatisfactory settings that 
don't support their potential. On a national competitive level, if we don't 
change, we are going to get eaten for lunch because Japan and other countries 
are taking a very aggressive look at the future of white-collar workers." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland, who specializes in new ways to organize people and technology, is 
studying the evolution of the work environment in the United States and its 
relationship to architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't mention architecture or ergonomic chairs or computers when 
discussing the future workplace. In fact, he doesn't like the word place, 
preferring to describe an office as a "collection of human beings who are 
information processors." 
</P>
<P>
And when Sutherland looks at today's typical American organization, he sees a 
dinosaur dragging into a fast-track global market with all the baggage of its 
industrial revolution background. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we work very much like people worked 100 years ago. We have a 
9-to-5 workday, a central place to work and a hierarchical, relatively 
bureaucratic structure." 
</P>
<P>
All these get in the way of today's need for flexibility and a streamlined 
information-processing strategy, he continued. "I think what we're realizing is 
that we're entering a global market era where the sine qua non of competitive 
advantage is intellect -- coming up with the right ideas faster. This suggests 
that we need a form of organization that can tap that potential." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he maintains, we are hampered by organizations that require a lot of 
data filtering. "Suppose that a customer has a good idea. It has to be passed 
on to the salesperson, then on to the marketing director, then on to product 
development, and so forth. The process is slow and each time it's passed on, it 
gets altered a bit, like the story passed around the campfire." 
</P>
<P>
The need in today's radically changing world, is to "get closer to the 
customer," or bring the organization closer to the outside world by 
facilitating decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
To Sutherland, the ideal organizational model is a system that can instantly 
communicate relevant experience so everybody can react in a shared way. With 
the computer network, he pointed out, we already have the technology to do 
that. What we need next is to break out of the physical box of the office. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland does not entirely buy into one common vision of the future: the idea 
of people staying home in their electronic cottages, doing the same work from 
home that they now do at the office. "Where you work is not important -- it's 
how you work. If I want to be a full-time daddy and work at home with my 
family, then that will enhance the quality of my work. (But) it's not a matter 
of electronic cottage versus the office." 
</P>
<P>
However, he sees the electronic cottage as a start in breaking out of the 
office-as-physical-place philosophy. He suggests that designers take the 
blinders off and not presume that the office is a physical space with four 
walls, a floor and a ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Design," he said, "has to occur everywhere. If I can work anywhere, any time, 
in any space, good design means that it has to be as effective to work in my 
car as in my home office." 
</P>
<P>
This would demand, in his view, something like a national design agenda that 
might also require a new profession. "In Japan we are not separating the future 
of the office from the future of national transportation or national 
communications. Everything is being considered together." The United States 
should do the same, he said. "For the first time in history we have the option 
to create a myriad of work environments, each one fine-tuned to meet the 
emotional, intellectual and physical demands of a task. 
</P>
<P>
"That could be a traditional office or my home, my car, or my boat because I 
work in all those places." Sutherland's favorite model for the office of the 
future is drawn from the past. He likes to show audiences a slide of Thomas 
Jefferson's bedroom/study at Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Jefferson had really thought out the integration of work in his life," 
he said. "His bed was between two rooms: he could roll out of bed on one side 
and be in his office and roll out on the other side and be in his home."

Celebrities hobnobbed backstage at the recent tribute to Sammy Davis Jr. at the 
Shrine Auditorium, congratulating the performer on his 60th anniversary in show 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Davis made a brief appearance at a packed backstage party after being honored 
on stage Monday by Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra and Bill Cosby, among others. 
Those who turned out included singer/dancer Paula Abdul, left, and heavyweight 
champ Mike Tyson with singer Dionne Warwick. Other guests included Whitney 
Houston, Eddie Murphy, Clint Eastwood, Bob Hope, Gregory Hines, and Gregory and 
Veronique Peck. 
</P>
<P>
The tribute, taped for a later airing on ABC, was also a fund-raiser for the 
United Negro College Fund.

HEARTBREAK OF COHABITATION ENDS IN DIVORCE; 
</P>
<P>
COUPLES: COHABITATION IS NOT ALWAYS A TEST GROUND FOR A PERMANENT MARRIAGE, BUT 
A SPAWNING PLACE FOR QUICK DIVORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They met at a party in that corny, some-enchanted-evening, 
across-a-crowded-room kind of way, she recalls fondly, even now. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen months later, they moved in together. Six months later, they married. 
Six years later, they separated and will divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"There might have been a better chance of us staying together if we had just 
gotten married," says Jane, a 27-year-old Baltimore County office manager who 
asked that her real name not be used. "The six months we lived together were 
pure heaven, and I had that to compare our marriage to. I knew different. I 
knew he was capable of more. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived together to find out if it would work, and it still didn't work. When 
you're living together, you try harder because it's easier (for your partner) 
to walk out. But once you get married, it's like all of a sudden, you relax." 
</P>
<P>
Living together before tying the knot, an increasingly common pattern that many 
assumed would boost the chances of succeeding at marriage, instead turns out to 
be a bane rather than a boon if what you want is a long-lasting marriage, 
recent research shows. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies have found that couples who live together first tend also to 
get divorced first. University of Wisconsin researchers report that 38% of 
couples who lived together before they married were divorced within 10 years, 
compared with 27% of couples who married without cohabiting first. 
</P>
<P>
The finding -- which follows a smaller, 1987 study that found an 80% higher 
divorce rate among couples who had lived together compared to those who hadn't 
-- surprised many experts who assumed that living together helped iron out 
potential marital problems and thus lessens the chances of divorce down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Different Values' 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who cohabit have a different set of values, values that carry 
with (them) an ethic that relationships are breakable if they're not personally 
satisfying. So they're more likely to resort to a divorce," says Andrew 
Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University who has collaborated 
on studies with the University of Wisconsin researchers. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't cohabit have more traditional values than people who do. 
They're people who won't resort to divorce; they believe in the permanence of 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin researchers, Larry L. Bumpass and James Sweet, drew their 
conclusions from an analysis of the National Survey of Families and Households, 
which in 1987 and 1988 interviewed 13,017 people about marriage and 
cohabitation. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings were surprising," says Geoffrey Greif, an associate professor at 
the University of Maryland School of Social Work. "People had believed that 
living together prenuptially was a sort of protection against the old myth that 
you got a lot of surprises after you got married." 
</P>
<P>
But he and other experts say that it is not the act of living together 
prenuptially that somehow leads to an eventual divorce. Rather, they say, a 
different kind of person chooses to cohabit rather than marry -- and it's the 
kind of person perhaps more likely to call it quits than to stay in a 
less-than-satisfying marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"The study speaks to the fact that you have a different population of people 
who live together," says Greif. "They tend to be more independently minded, 
people who are, properly, self-protective, probably tend to believe they have a 
right to happiness. And when things are not going well, they're more likely to 
end the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
The findings, sociologists say, are further evidence of the evolving nature of 
marriage and relationships. Economics, feminism, changing sexual attitudes, 
increased emphasis on "me" versus "we" -- these have all contributed to an 
altered configuration of how we live, whom we live with and under what kind of 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing economic status of women, there's less reason to marry," 
Cherlin says. "Second, there is a greater acceptance of sex outside of 
marriage. And third, there are changing values -- there's an increased emphasis 
on personal satisfaction in intimate relationships, less emphasis on working 
together." 
</P>
<P>
While marriage is an institution being challenged by alternative arrangements, 
it is too early to sound the death knell, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the emphasis on personal satisfaction, we still believe in marriage. 
We still value the stability that formal marriage brings us, the public 
announcement that we want to stay together the rest of our lives. And most of 
us still think children should be raised in a marriage," he says. "Most people 
still want to get married, but most people won't condemn someone who isn't 
married." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Step 
</P>
<P>
And cohabiting increasingly is viewed as a natural first step in the direction 
of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"For most people cohabitation is still more or less a trial marriage," Cherlin 
says. "About half of cohabiting relationships end in a year, either with the 
couple getting married or breaking up. It's not a lifelong relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Living together has most prominently become a part of divorce. When divorced 
people remarry today, nearly 60% of them will live together first, researchers 
have found. 
</P>
<P>
Carol, a 45-year-old Baltimore woman who asked that her name not be used, lived 
with her second husband before they married "because you don't see all the 
warts and scars in brief encounters over the weekend or overnight." 
</P>
<P>
They lived together for six months, married, but ended up divorcing four years 
later. Incidentally, she didn't live with her first husband before their 
marriage, which lasted 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
(There are no statistics yet available comparing the durability of second 
marriages that are preceded by cohabitation with those where the couple did not 
live together.) 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have all the answers," Carol says of what effect living 
together had on their subsequent marriage. "We bought a house while we were 
living together, and the kids were in school, and it was kind of like you make 
all these financial commitments, how do you back out of it now? It was almost 
like it was too difficult to go backward. 
</P>
<P>
"You begin to make commitments, and you're moving in a certain track," she 
says, "and it's easier to keep on going that way rather than backpedal."

EXERCISE IS A WINNER IN BATTLE WITH PMS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME APPEAR LESS SEVERE IF A WOMAN 
ADDS EXERCISE TO HER DAILY REGIMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD SECOR COUZENS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premenstrual syndrome has numerous treatments even though doctors still don't 
know its exact cause. But the good news for women who suffer from PMS is that 
experts say a regular program of exercise can relieve many of its physical and 
emotional symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Normal premenstrual symptoms, called "molimina," can include moodiness, 
increased appetite, bloating and breast tenderness. While PMS has similar 
symptoms, what sets it apart is the severity of those symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 70 different treatments for PMS, many of which are 
contradictory, untested, expensive or have unknown long-term effects, exercise 
is often recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular exercise has very real benefits for women with PMS," says Dr. Joan 
Ullyot, a San Francisco sports medicine physician and psychologist who is also 
a world-ranked masters distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular exercisers may have some sort of bloating and sluggishness in 
premenstrual days, but the mood problems are often eliminated." Ullyot believes 
that it's the profound effect that exercise has on the hormones of the brain, 
uterus and ovaries that brings about these psychological changes. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerilynn C. Prior, an associate professor of endocrinology at the 
University of British Columbia, also recommends a conditioning exercise program 
not only because of its effect on hormones, but also because exercise reduces 
fat levels, a key in relieving PMS symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
In a controlled six-month study of three groups of women, Prior found that 
breast and fluid-related symptoms were reduced in formerly sedentary women who 
started to run a mile a day. The reason? Most likely, she theorizes, because 
the hypothalamus, the site in the brain where premenstrual symptoms originate, 
may have been suppressed by exercise and resulting weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is that of Justine Malinski, a 41-year-old Oak Park, Ill., 
biochemist. Two years ago, the demands of graduate school, coupled with a sore 
knee, forced her to stop running. She usually ran 50 miles a week. When she 
stopped exercising, Malinski developed the symptoms of PMS. "My body seemed out 
of control, and I only had one week of good health a month," Malinski recalls 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen days before my menstruation, my PMS symptoms would range from 
paranoia, fatigue, water retention and bloating. It was difficult bending down 
to tie my shoes because of the fullness in my middle, and I was easily 
irritated," she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"I also had an extreme craving for good food but could never satisfy it. The 
worst symptom, though, was breast tenderness. They would change size, and I 
would often wake in the middle of the night in pain." 
</P>
<P>
As the months passed, Malinski desperately sought solutions. She took doses of 
vitamin B6 for a while, ate several small meals during the day and eliminated 
fats, refined sugars and caffeine from her diet. Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotional component was terrible," she says. "I was often angry and, when 
little things started to bother me, I had to constantly force myself to breathe 
in and breathe out to keep my anger in." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, her knee rehabilitated, Malinski joined a group of women who go 
for one long run a week and average 11-16 miles each workout. The effect on her 
PMS symptoms was miraculous, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"My weekly run was enough to completely eliminate all of my breast tenderness 
as well as reduce much of the water retention and bloating," Malinski says. She 
is convinced that exercise was the only reliable treatment for her PMS 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"For most women with PMS, exercise is one of the first interventions I would 
recommend," says Dr. Sally K. Severino, an associate professor of psychiatry at 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in White Plains, and author of 
"Premenstrual Syndrome: A Clinician's Guide." 
</P>
<P>
"Exercise isn't harmful for someone with PMS, and it can help relieve 
water-retention problems and improve self-esteem," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Women with PMS who don't exercise will, for the most part, experience a 
beneficial response from exercise, says Dr. Michelle Warren, the head of 
reproductive endocrinology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's approach to PMS is to look for possible hormonal imbalances. If 
appropriate, she offers hormonal treatment and recommends exercise. "I tell my 
patients to perspire for 20 minutes, three to four times a week. Their 
resulting improvement is probably linked to endorphins and an improved sense of 
self-esteem," Warren says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consistency Is Key 
</P>
<P>
The medical experts conclude that the type of aerobic exercise performed seems 
to have no bearing on the amount of relief from PMS symptoms. If you like to 
run, bicycle, swim or take aerobics classes, then do so. What's extremely 
important, they say, is that the exercise be consistent, every week, with 
allowances for how you feel. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think you have to push yourself through a tough workout if you don't 
feel that good," cautions Ullyot. "Don't be so tough on yourself. There are 
times when it's just better to go easy or else take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
"Most women can tolerate PMS symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness and 
constipation, but what really causes them to seek medical help is when they 
develop emotional symptoms," Severino says. "They don't like being irritable, 
angry, depressed or anxious, and they want help." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for women to know that PMS is a recognized symptom, that it's 
cyclic, and that it improves with certain forms of therapy," Warren says. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no specific treatment for PMS (placebos work in many cases, 
Warren notes), and the scientific explanation for PMS is still vague, Warren 
believes an expert should still be consulted for help. 
</P>
<P>
"PMS falls on the edge of science," she says, "and we're in an area where 
people are doing a lot of research. If you think that you have PMS, it's best 
to consult a PMS specialist, someone who's usually a reproductive 
endocrinologist. Most major hospitals will be able to make recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
The Melpomene Institute, a center for research and public education on the 
health concerns of physically active women, has a PMS information packet 
available for $7.50. For requests or further information, write the Melpomene 
Institute, 2125 E. Hennepin Ave., Minneapolis, Minn. 55413.

INNOVATION: ADVICE ON HOW IBM CAN RETAIN GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Subject: Boosting IBM 
</P>
<P>
John: 
</P>
<P>
Because you are a realist, you know that this past year can best be described 
as a blend of frustration and disappointment. Key shipments in mainframe disk 
drives slipped, software sales from the highly touted applications systems 
division are growing at rates less than half the industry average, and IBM 
stock has woefully underperformed the Dow. The only people more confused about 
IBM's direction than Wall Streeters are your own employees and customers. 
</P>
<P>
You're certainly saying all the right things, but IBMers and your customers 
aren't hungry for rhetoric. They're hungry for the opportunity to push IBM to 
new levels of excellence. The challenge is how? How can IBM be great as a 
business and information technology innovator? That's what this memo is about. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamics of your industry have changed in ways you have yet to publicly 
acknowledge. My fear is that, much like post-Oil Shock General Motors, IBM may 
be a great company on the verge of losing its greatness. Most of the following 
advice comes from people who have spent decades at the company and who care 
very deeply about its future, both as a business and as a great institution; 
some of it comes from customers who are looking to you for more than just 
products and services. Please take this advice in the spirit in which it is 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
1. Stop treating your customers as consumers. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, IBM marketing reps could saunter onto a customer site confident 
that they knew more about data processing than the customer. That's no longer 
true. Today, your customers know more about what they need than you do. IBM 
succeeded too well in convincing industry that information is a strategic 
commodity. Nevertheless, many of your people still behave as if Big Blue is the 
font of all information systems wisdom. That's as annoying as it is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly annoying because the typical IBM rep now has more than 2,000 
product and service offerings to keep track of; they know less and less about 
more and more. In other words, at the same time your customers have gotten 
smarter, your people in the field have become more ignorant. That's an 
inevitable byproduct of trying to be a full-service provider. So knock off that 
ridiculous ad campaign that makes IBM out as omniscient. A little humility 
would go a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Start treating your customers as people whom you can learn from as well as sell 
to. Create sales and engineering teams that are rewarded not only for selling 
systems but also for getting customers to co-develop applications that can be 
used industrywide. The success of your AS400 minicomputer was due in large part 
to customer involvement in development -- the rare exception to the rule. 
Publicly encourage your people to leverage customers' knowledge into IBM's own 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, your "business partners" effort to co-market with software companies 
and others is an excellent idea but frequently creates tensions that leave the 
customers' concerns subordinate to "partnership" problems. 
</P>
<P>
You have got to sit down with your top managers to define how IBM can create 
"proprietary relationships" with customers rather than "proprietary 
technologies" for them. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, IBM is a technology leader but your customers are less willing to pay a 
premium for high technology than for platforms that let them readily design 
cost-effective environments for managing information. You have to persuade them 
that you're not just selling solutions -- you're empowering them to build their 
own solutions today in ways that won't trap them tomorrow. A commitment to 
greater joint development lets you build new solutions, relationships and 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
2. Be less strategic and more tactical. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has more strategies than NATO and the Pentagon combined. Unfortunately, the 
company seems unencumbered by any tactical sense. One longtime IBMer remarks 
that you prefer to "steer the ship and see what the market does" rather than 
"let the market drive these things." That's not my idea of customer-responsive. 
The reason is obvious: IBM moves too slowly to be tactical. Big Blue still 
relies more on momentum than initiative. With the notable exception of the IBM 
PC, product development still takes years. Technical development is not treated 
as urgently as sales development. The result is vaporware. 
</P>
<P>
You're (slowly) moving in the right direction. But now that high-tech product 
cycles can turn in less than 18 months, you can't afford to take two years to 
get to market. And yet, we almost never hear IBM talk about its quickness in 
market response. Why? Shouldn't IBM be prepared to crash develop products like 
laptop computers that clearly have become market staples? Shouldn't you 
publicly champion speed to market as a virtue and change your compensation 
system accordingly? 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the current Harvard Business Review features former IBM Senior Vice 
President Ralph Gomory arguing that accelerating the product development cycle 
is the key to industrial competitiveness. Speed is critical to customer 
responsiveness. So soften the grand visions and offer hard technology. 
Emphasize customer response over strategic aspirations. Customers would rather 
buy great systems than great strategies. 
</P>
<P>
3. Opt for bold investments rather than bold acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
OK, the Rolm telecommunications acquisition was a disaster but the MCI and 
Intel investments weren't. You've taken bite-sized equity stakes in lots of 
little software firms. That's smart. Do much much more of it. But ownership 
matters less than influence. Position IBM as the world's investment banker for 
provocative software. Use these investments to boost your innovation image. A 
rising software tide lifts all your hardware boats. Careful investing gets 
these companies to do your software research and development dirty work for 
under 40 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Have fun. Scare a few people. Why not buy 10% of Compaq Computer? Fifteen 
percent of Cray? Twenty percent of Stratus Computer? Buy a Macintosh software 
company. Send the message that you're prepared to invest in quality information 
technology firms anywhere in the world. You've got cash -- use it. Emulate 
Olivetti; invest in networks of technology firms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will these investments command attention, they'll give you a window on 
technology and management that you couldn't possibly build in-house. This also 
enables you to raise the quality standards of various market niches even as you 
set the technical standards. Whatever you do, don't call this "diversification" 
-- describe it as what IBM should naturally be doing. Get people to take IBM's 
strong presence in growth markets for granted. Confusing? Yes, but don't call 
it "confusion" -- call it "choice." 
</P>
<P>
4. Break up IBM. 
</P>
<P>
It's better to be a Gorbachev than a Honecker. As recent events confirm, 
planned economies don't work as well as market forces. Right now, IBM's 
$60-billion annual economy resembles Kremlin econometrics more than Adam Smith. 
Ask any IBMer who works with customers and they'll tell you they spend more 
time coordinating things inside the company than with the outside world. That's 
bad. So make a virtue of necessity. "Deregulate" IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, you should set up a holding company (a la Citicorp in global banking) 
to coordinate -- not control -- the efforts of multibillion-dollar IBM-lettes. 
Keep the key technologies like semiconductor packaging and magnetic recording 
in the holding company (not to mention network and telecommunications 
standards) but spin out the entry systems division as a stand-alone company, as 
well as the mainframe group, the workstation-Unix people, and the AS400 
minicomputer folks. Turn your semiconductor plants loose onto the marketplace. 
Lead IBM as a coalition, not as a monolith. 
</P>
<P>
Will it be a test of your management abilities to get these new companies to 
alternately cooperate and compete to serve IBM clients? Absolutely. But only by 
splitting IBM can you assign accountability, encourage greater customer contact 
and development and respond swiftly to market challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Do you run the risk of creating half a dozen weaker IBMs? Yes, but only if you 
don't believe that your people can handle new responsibility and added 
competition. In your heart and mind, you know that competition from American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Apple Computer, Digital Equipment and Sun 
Microsystems has made IBM a better company in the 1980s. Why not lose market 
share to your own companies instead of someone else's in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
By any measure, IBM is a national asset. You have managed to keep the company's 
full employment practice through difficult times and you have made major 
commitments to support this country's technology base. Look deep into your 
company and you will see talented people who want to add value to both IBM and 
their customers. Listen to your customers and you'll hear people tell you that 
IBM isn't as responsive as it can be. 
</P>
<P>
If you do that, I think you'll agree that you have the unique opportunity to 
turn IBM into several great global companies. You can be the steward of a great 
tradition or a leader who builds a new generation of companies upon that 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, good luck.

Great American May Violate Capital Rules: San Diego-based Great American Bank, 
the nation's eighth-largest thrift, said it will be unable to meet certain new 
federal capital requirements by a Dec. 7 deadline. The thrift said it expected 
to continue operating under normal conditions but would have to apply for 
regulatory approval if its board decided to declare a regular quarterly 
dividend in January. Great American said it currently meets the tangible 
capital requirement of 1.5% of assets and is "just a hair shy" of the core 
capital requirement of 3% of assets.

Hammer Disregards Speculation: Occidental Petroleum's 91-year-old chairman, 
Armand Hammer, has dismissed rumors that the Los Angeles-based firm might 
become a takeover target upon his retirement or death, a company spokesman 
said. Such speculation had driven the stock up on reports of Hammer's 
hospitalization for insertion of a heart pacemaker last week, and the stock 
closed up $1.50 at $30.125 Wednesday. Separately, the spokesman confirmed that 
Occidental rejected two offers for its 51% stake in beef processor IBP Inc. 
earlier this year and has no plans to sell its stake. The Dow Jones 
Professional Investor Report estimated that one offer was about $1 billion.

GE WILL BUY CONTROLLING INTEREST IN MAJOR HUNGARIAN FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: THE $150-MILLION DEAL IS THE LARGEST WESTERN INVESTMENT SO FAR 
IN THE EAST BLOC. IT MAY SPARK SIMILAR MOVES BY OTHER COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BURGESS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Electric Co. announced Wednesday that it will make the largest Western 
investment to date in the newly opening economies of Eastern Europe, spending 
$150 million for controlling interest in a major Hungarian light-bulb company. 
</P>
<P>
In one stroke, the deal will more than triple the stake of U.S. businesses in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
After the purchase is closed later this year, GE plans to spend a modest amount 
of money to upgrade technology at Tungsram Co., one of Hungary's larger 
industrial concerns, with annual sales of $300 million. Based in Budapest, the 
company makes residential, automotive and industrial bulbs at 12 factories. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a look at Europe in total, both East and West, where we hope the 
lines will blur over time," said GE Chairman John F. Welch. 
</P>
<P>
GE will own 50% plus one share of the company, and have an option to buy 30% 
more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies have tended to lag behind those of other countries, particularly 
West Germany, in enthusiasm for the region. The GE deal may spark investment by 
other U.S. companies, suggested Donald Hasfurther, director of East-West trade 
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It will lend a certain credibility and stability to the scene over there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was announced one day after Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, visiting 
Washington, renewed a plea for more investment in his Eastern European country, 
Poland. Many analysts argue that this is necessary to raise living standards in 
the region and further bind it on the road to political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher praised the GE deal. "U.S. private 
investment in Hungary is the best way for the United States to provide the 
capital, managerial know-how and entrepreneurial dynamism that Hungary needs to 
make the transition to a Western-style market economy," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Eastern European countries, Hungary has led the pack in throwing open 
its doors to Western investment. It has offered a number of large state-owned 
enterprises for sale and energetically courted buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary is on the way to democracy and the development of a free-enterprise 
system," Tungsram President Andras Gabor said in a statement released by GE on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no going back now, only forward," he said. "GE's participation in 
Tungsram gives us the opportunity both to grow our lighting business and to 
embrace this process of change." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said talks with the Hungarian authorities and owners had begun only this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been candid, open, constructive," he said. "This has been as 
straightforward a negotiation as any of the global negotiations we've ever 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Welch conceded that the Hungarian company, which sells to both Eastern and 
Western Europe, may be threatened as the East opens up to competition. But he 
expressed confidence that the venture will succeed, predicting it will become a 
low-cost, high-quality producer in an East-West market that will increasingly 
merge into one. "We know this business cold," he said, calling GE's technology 
in it "world class." 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hungary might be carrying a greater risk, because the deal 
might serve as a test case of whether the liberalization policies there will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department has identified almost 30 U.S. joint ventures in 
Hungary that account for about $70 million in investment, not including GE's. 
(Total Western investment in Hungary was about $400 million before this deal.) 
</P>
<P>
The GE deal "actually triples U.S. investment in Hungary," said Russell 
Johnson, the Commerce Department's desk officer for Hungary. Among the U.S. 
companies now in Hungary are the McDonald's fast-food chain, advertising 
company Ogilvy &amp; Mather and bicycle maker Schwinn.

Hit by a record $87.5-million loss in the third quarter, Mack Trucks Inc. must 
borrow money from Renault and extend its bank loans "to continue as a going 
concern," the company says. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than filing for bankruptcy, Mack is seeking additional funds from the 
Renault Vehicules Industriels division of the French auto maker, which owns 45% 
of Mack's stock, as well as renegotiating credit agreements with its banks. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter loss reported Tuesday was the worst in Mack's history, as was 
the loss for the first three quarters. The company was in the red $105.9 
million for the nine months, contrasted with a profit of $17.9 million for the 
same period of last year.

A state appeals court Wednesday overturned the bank fraud conviction of Marvin 
Warner, a key figure in the 1985 crisis that struck savings and loan 
associations in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The court overturned Warner's conviction on charges unauthorized transfer of 
funds and other acts, as well as an order that he pay $22 million in 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio Atty. Gen. Anthony Celebrezze said he would appeal the ruling to the 
state's supreme court because it was based on technicalities. He said Ohio had 
already spent $5.5 million prosecuting the case and would continue to pursue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was sentenced to 42 months in 
jail but has been free on bond and living in Florida while the appeal was 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
Warner was convicted in 1987 of illegally diverting millions of dollars from a 
Cincinnati savings association to a securities trading company. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Warner's Home State Savings Bank, then the state's largest 
privately insured savings and loan, caused a run on other savings and loans in 
Ohio, forcing state officials to close 71 institutions until stability 
returned.

CREDIT CARDS CHARGING LOWER RATES SCARCER NOW IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lower-rate credit cards have become scarcer for Californians than a year ago, a 
consumer group has found. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey to be released today, Consumer Action in San Francisco found that 
only 16 cards with annual percentage rates of 16% or less were made available 
to Californians by out-of-state financial institutions. That was down from 27 
cards a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Among California-based institutions, only four cards were available with rates 
of 16% or less, compared to nine a year earlier, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
It also found that the average interest rate on credit cards offered by 
California institutions was 17.97%, up slightly from a year earlier. The 
average annual fee was $15.16, down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The group cited three major reasons for the reduced availability of lower-rate 
cards. First, some institutions raised rates. Second, some lower-rate 
out-of-state cards were no longer available to Californians. Third, some credit 
card portfolios were sold to other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Action surveyed California institutions on Sept. 4. The group surveyed 
18 out-of-state institutions that make cards available to Californians on Oct. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Action said it did not survey all financial institutions, adding that 
it is possible, but unlikely, that other lower-cost cards are offered. 
</P>
<P>
Among California institutions that raised rates, the largest increase was by 
American Savings Bank, the once-troubled institution based in Stockton that was 
taken over last December by investor Robert M. Bass. Last year, American's rate 
was 15%. As of September of this year, it was 18.9%, up about 26%. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Nelson, an American Savings spokeswoman, said the large percentage 
increase is misleading because American in the past was very aggressive in 
marketing credit card accounts. It offered an unusually low rate before, she 
said, and now offers a rate similar to those of its competitors.

Dresser Industries Inc., an oil services company, said Wednesday that it has 
offered to purchase Smith International Inc., a manufacturer of oil and gas 
drilling equipment, in a deal valued at $567 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dresser said the acquisition would broaden its base and prepare the company for 
resurgence in the petroleum business. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a recognition that the bust is behind us and we're going to move," 
said Dresser spokesman Herb Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Dresser has offered $14.25 in cash plus a warrant for each of Smith's 32.4 
million shares, or about $462 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan also said Dresser would assume about $106 million in Smith's debt, 
boosting the value of the deal to about $567 million. 
</P>
<P>
The board of Houston-based Smith International has approved the merger.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market was swept higher Wednesday by a late burst of buying, spurred 
by bargain hunting and the growing belief that interest rates will be eased. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday, rebounded 22.33 
to 2,632.58. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 926 up, 595 down and 465 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates fell a bit in the Treasury bond market Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to the monthly 
report from the government today on the nation's international trade position. 
</P>
<P>
Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade deficit of about $9 
billion, down from $10.8 billion in August. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent weakening 
trend of corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter profits, and early indications of likely fourth-quarter results, 
have contained numerous disappointments, stirring talk of a possible business 
slump in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has relaxed its credit policy lately in an evident effort 
to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy. But some observers have 
questioned whether the Fed acted early enough or emphatically enough to stave 
off trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Among the blue chips that contributed to the Dow Jones industrials' gain, 
General Electric rose 1 1/4 to 56 3/4, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added 
1/2 to 43 3/8, Procter &amp; Gamble rose 2 3/8 to 129 1/2, Coca-Cola edged up 
3/4 to 74 and Eastman Kodak gained 1/2 to 42 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum climbed 1 1/2 to 30 1/8. Armand Hammer, the company's 
91-year-old chief executive, described recent takeover speculation involving 
the stock as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
IBP Inc., which is 51% owned by Occidental, added 1 1/8 to 15 5/8. Occidental 
said it turned down two offers earlier this year for its stake in the 
beef-processing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Baker Hughes rose 1 1/4 to 24 1/4. The company reported higher operating income 
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Among other energy issues, Chevron gained 2 to 63 5/8, Amerada-Hess rose 3/4 to 
44 7/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 52 3/4, Schlumberger climbed 1 1/8 to 43 1/8 and 
Halliburton added 1 1/2 to 38 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
M-A-Com, which discontinued its quarterly dividend, slipped 1/8 to 5 5/8, 
trading at 10-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume rose to 155.13 million shares, against 143.17 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks posted record closing levels for the third consecutive session but 
closed below their day's highs on selling by foreign brokers in heavy trading. 
The key 225-share Nikkei index rose 83.59 to a record 35,852.23. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell in thin trading on the London Stock Exchange, undercut by 
disappointing British corporate earnings. The Financial Times 100-share index 
closed 11.3 points lower at 2,203.4. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also rose, getting a lift from a new government report pointing to 
further weakness in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond advanced about 5/16 point, or $3.13 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield declined to 7.85% from 7.88% late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the release of a report that business inventories climbed 0.2% in 
September was partly responsible for the upturn in bond prices. The rise 
followed a revised gain of 0.4% in August. 
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of goods on shelves and back lots rising faster than sales 
could be bad news for the economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, 
it could mean cuts in production and a loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As the economy slackens, the chances increase that the Fed could lower interest 
rates to stimulate business activity. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, bond prices benefited from the market's "relief that the refunding 
was over," said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the government completed its quarterly refunding with an auction of 
$10 billion in 30-year Treasury bonds. The Treasury had sold $10 billion in 
three-year notes last Thursday and $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills 
last Friday, bringing to market a heavy supply of new government issues that 
could have been difficult to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.50%, up from 8.438% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended higher in domestic trading against major foreign currencies 
after declining overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange 
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $391.30, down $2 from 
late Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $390.90, 
off $1.60. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Holzer, a vice president and chief dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in 
Chicago, attributed the dollar's gains in New York partly to "a small 
correction from yesterday's selloff ahead of the trade figures." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the merchandise trade figures 
for September today, and the market sentiment is that it would show a narrowing 
of the deficit to $8 billion to $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, Holzer said that if the report reveals further economic weakness, 
particularly by showing a decline in U.S. exports, the dollar could head lower. 
"The fundamentals are still working against the dollar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several recent economic reports have pointed to an economic slowdown, which 
spells bad news for dollar investors because it could signal lower interest 
rates. Lower rates tend to depress a currency. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 143.37 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen Tuesday. It 
traded at 143.45 yen in London and rose to 143.795 yen in New York from 143.05 
yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound traded at $1.5810 in London, unchanged from late Tuesday's 
rate. In New York, the pound fell to $1.5803 from $1.5945. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of silver futures soared to six-month highs, while gold and platinum, 
the recent leaders of the surging precious metals group, fell. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, prices of pork futures rose sharply amid talk of 
further food aid to Poland; grains and soybeans were mostly higher, and energy 
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures settled 13 to 15.1 cents higher on New York's Commodity 
Exchange, with the contract for delivery in December at $5.538 an ounce, the 
highest price for a near-month silver contract since May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gold finished $1.90 to $2.10 lower on the Comex, with December at $392.80 an 
ounce; platinum settled $5.20 to $5.30 lower on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, with January at $520.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals prices have risen broadly since Oct. 13, when a 190-point 
plunge in the Dow Jones industrials index triggered a rush of investment 
dollars to the perceived safety of the metals. 
</P>
<P>
But the silver market has lagged behind gold and platinum, possibly because 
silver is in greater supply. From Oct. 13 through Tuesday, gold prices had 
risen 7.5%, platinum by 6.9% and silver by 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Silver played catch-up on Wednesday, pushing its gains since Friday the 13th to 
7.8%.

FBI INFORMANT CONVICTED OF O.C. MURDER ATTEMPT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso, a longtime FBI informant with ties to organized crime, 
was convicted Wednesday of attempted first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 
1987 shooting of Mustang Club financier William Carroll, who had resisted mob 
efforts to take over the topless bar's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California law enforcement officials were excited about the verdict in 
the closely watched Grosso trial because of its implications for Los Angeles 
racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello. Rizzitello, Grosso's co-defendant, is 
scheduled to go on trial Dec. 11 for the shooting of Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello, listed by the state attorney general's office as an underboss in 
the Los Angeles-based Milano crime family, has a long history of fraud and 
racketeering convictions. But if convicted in the attack on Carroll, he could 
face the most serious sentence of his life. Rizzitello has denied participation 
in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, left permanently blind in the May 1, 1987, shooting in a Costa Mesa 
parking garage, identified Rizzitello, 62, as the gunman, and Grosso, 46, as 
the driver who held him down to prevent his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Kathleen Bruck of Costa Mesa said jurors hearing Grosso's trial in 
Orange County Superior Court believed the victim's testimony that Rizzitello 
was the man who shot him, and that Grosso was a participant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good sign for the Rizzitello trial," said one law enforcement 
official. "He has to be worried that Carroll's testimony held up here." 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, wearing the same chocolate brown shirt he has worn throughout his 
trial, showed no emotion when the verdicts were read. He has predicted "I will 
be killed" for telling jurors that Rizzitello was the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, who faces an automatic sentence of 25 years to life in prison, was 
found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted first-degree murder and 
mayhem for leaving Carroll permanently blind. The jurors also found use of a 
firearm during the commission of a crime -- because they believe Rizzitello was 
armed -- which could add one more year to Grosso's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. set a Dec. 12 sentencing date for Grosso 
and ordered him to cooperate with a probation officer for a pre-sentencing 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso has denied any ties to Rizzitello, or that he knew a shooting was about 
to take place. But his testimony is considered important at the Rizzitello 
trial, because he corroborates Carroll's claim that Rizzitello was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they found Grosso's denial of his involvement difficult to believe 
because he had told too many different stories about what happened before his 
trial began. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had told just one story throughout, we could possibly have come to a 
different conclusion," Bruck said. "But from the first day of our 
deliberations, we believed he was involved." 
</P>
<P>
Before the trial, Grosso had told a Times reporter that Rizzitello was not even 
in the car at the time, and that the shooter had been "Big George" Yudzevich, a 
bouncer at the Mustang who has since been murdered. Grosso also admitted on the 
witness stand that he had told "probably more than 25" different versions of 
what happened while he was at Orange County Jail awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
But within a week of testimony in the trial, Grosso met with law enforcement 
officials in an attempt to plea bargain, and made numerous other inconsistent 
statements about his activities that day. Grosso has a long history of 
informing to the FBI, and told jurors that he had provided the agency 
considerable details about Carroll's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso claimed he had to lie because Rizzitello had threatened to kill him if 
he didn't deny Rizzitello's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to show the jurors that Mr. Grosso had to tell different stories 
about what happened to protect himself from being killed," said Grosso's 
attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr. of Newport Beach. "But obviously they did not 
accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated five full days and part of a sixth, but Bruck said there was 
little disagreement that Grosso was involved in the Carroll shooting. The 
number of charges, and some difficulty with the legal definition of mayhem 
accounted for the lengthy deliberations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 56, is one of three people involved in the operation of the 
now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard who were targets of gunmen. 
Murdered just four months before the Carroll shooting was club operator Jimmy 
Casino, who borrowed money from Carroll to start the club. Also murdered nearly 
a year after the Carroll shooting was Yudzevich. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials are tight-lipped about whether Rizzitello is a 
suspect in either of those shootings. But Grosso told jurors that Carroll had 
admitted responsibility for both murders. Law enforcement sources say 
privately, however, that Carroll has never been a serious suspect in those 
shootings, which remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman Bruck said jurors were convinced that Carroll had not been honest with 
them about all his business activities. But she declined to say which parts of 
Carroll's testimony raised skepticism among the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Grosso's claims that he was only Carroll's driver, prosecutors had a 
strong witness to corroborate Carroll's testimony that Grosso was more deeply 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Lesher, a banker who took over the club's operation while Carroll was 
recuperating, testified that he had caved in to Rizzitello's demands to muscle 
in on the bar's profits after the racketeer threatened him. Lesher testified 
that Grosso was the one who set up his meeting with Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was found bleeding and left for dead shortly after midnight in a 
deserted parking garage. Police investigators at his hospital bedside urged him 
to name his assailants, convinced they were taking a dying statement. 
</P>
<P>
Although he pulled through, Carroll refused for 18 months to talk about the 
shooting. A year ago, shortly after bank fraud charges pending against him 
resulted only in a misdemeanor conviction, Carroll agreed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
He explained to jurors that he was afraid to talk before his own case was 
resolved for fear that if he had to serve time in Orange County Jail, 
Rizzitello would have arranged for him to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said he was first approached by Rizzitello -- through Grosso -- shortly 
after the Casino murder. Because Carroll had not been repaid most of $250,000 
he had loaned Casino, he became the unofficial overseer of the club's 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello never made any overt attempts with the financier to muscle in on the 
club, according to Carroll's testimony. But he said Rizzitello did pressure him 
into giving him a $10,000 loan, and that friction developed between them after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello realized he would get nowhere muscling 
Carroll and decided to eliminate him to get to Lesher. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said Grosso arranged a meeting between Rizzitello and him at Emilia's 
restaurant in Santa Ana on April 30, 1987. Someone had taken a shot at Carroll 
10 days earlier, and he thought Rizzitello could tell him who it was. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, Carroll said, Grosso and Rizzitello asked him to drive them to 
the Costa Mesa parking garage, where Grosso's wife had left his car. Grosso 
drove Carroll's rented car for him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll told jurors that once he saw that the parking garage was deserted, he 
knew something was wrong. By then, he said, Rizzitello had grabbed him around 
the neck and had a gun pointed at his head.

LOOSE ENDS: Joseph Angelo Grosso has been convicted (A1), but two 
investigations related to the mob-tainted demise of Santa Ana's Mustang Club 
topless bar are stalled. . . . The investigation of the 1987 murder in Buena 
Park of club operator Jimmy Lee Casino is "in kind of a limbo," police say. . . 
. And in Brea, where Horace Joseph (Big Mac) McKenna was killed in March, the 
investigation "is winding down rapidly," investigators said. Dana Parsons and

CALL BOX MYSTERY: Call boxes on Orange County freeways average 32 calls over a 
three-month period, but the phones on the Riverside Freeway in Santa Ana 
Canyon, the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach and the El Toro Y are averaging 
twice as many. . . . No one knows why, but officials are working with the CHP 
on a computerized system that will be able to identify types of calls by call

JASON'S BATTLE FOR LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FAMILY OF A SEVERELY HANDICAPPED 9-YEAR-OLD IS WAGING A CORDIAL 
COURT BATTLE TO OBTAIN MORE IN-HOME CARE. THE OUTCOME WILL SURELY SET A

<P>
No one doubts that Jason Alan Goldberg of Yorba Linda needs a lot of help just 
to stay alive. The 9-year-old quadriplegic -- blind, deaf, retarded and 
suffering from cerebral palsy -- has a million-dollar smile but lungs not worth 
a dime. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses have to pound his chest five times a day just to keep his lungs clear. 
He dons an airtight mask four times a day just to breathe the medicines that 
help keep his air passage free. 
</P>
<P>
"No one said life would be convenient," says his father, Russ Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
But for Goldberg and his wife, Monica, who moved from Culver City to Orange 
County two months ago, getting help with Jason's care hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
They are now in Superior Court in a cordial but significant battle with the 
Orange County Development Disabilities Center over who should pay the cost of 
Jason's round-the-clock nursing care. The result undoubtedly will set a 
precedent for home care for the handicapped in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tremendous sympathy for the Goldbergs; we greatly admire their 
determination not to put Jason in an institution," said Donald Sizemore, 
spokesman for the center. "But if the courts make us provide the care the 
Goldbergs want, it will have a significant impact on our budget for future 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
The Goldbergs, who have three other children younger than Jason, want 16 hours 
of daily nursing care for their son. Monica Goldberg is a registered nurse; she 
covers the other eight hours in the day. 
</P>
<P>
What the Orange County center says it can give them is 32 hours a month. Its 
officials agree that Jason needs much more. But they have told the Goldbergs 
that other state assistance should be available to them. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk ordered the center to 
provide 16 hours a day of service to the Goldbergs until a hearing can be held, 
probably in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County center had already provided the 16 hours to the Goldbergs on 
an emergency basis, beginning in October. And Sizemore says the center will 
gladly give the Goldbergs permanent, 16-hour daily help if that is what the 
court eventually orders. But, he added, it will mean turning to the state 
Legislature for more money. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time the Goldbergs have gone to court for their son. But 
then, Russ Goldberg says, he and his wife have done a lot of things they had 
never anticipated before Jason was born. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Goldberg takes the late shift in nursing care for her son. She sleeps 
with a room monitor next to her ear so she can listen to her son's breathing. 
No night is free from two to three trips to his room, usually for more 
treatment to keep his breathing clear. His parents know that one choking bout 
could kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Vacations or even weekends away are almost unheard of for the Goldbergs. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the past nine years has been a blur," Russ Goldberg said. "But Jason 
is Jason. We've never known him any other way." 
</P>
<P>
They first learned about their son's condition shortly after his birth in Santa 
Monica in 1980. He suffers from CMV, a virus disorder that attacks the immune 
system; it is often transmitted when the mother has a virus of her own. 
</P>
<P>
The Goldbergs, who both work in the health-care field, got some state help, 
first eight hours a month, then 25 hours a month, and eventually 100 hours a 
month. But they know that Jason needs 16 hours a day -- 496 hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stressed out; we had no home life, I had no friends," Monica Goldberg 
said, recalling those early years. 
</P>
<P>
Jason required hip surgery in 1986, and after that the Goldbergs were certain 
that they would have to get more help. In early 1987, they got it, through the 
John Hancock Insurance Co., which paid for 16-hour-a-day nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
The first major problem came in late 1988, when the Goldbergs and the insurance 
company disagreed over how much longer the policy should run. The Goldbergs 
went to court in Los Angeles and won an extension, thanks to help from a group 
of lawyers from Protection and Advocacy, a nonprofit corporation in Glendale 
which specializes in helping the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
But in preparation for the final insurance payments two months ago, the 
Goldbergs went back to the Westside Development Disabilities Center for help. 
Westside, after first saying no, finally agreed to pay for 16 hours a day when 
the insurance ran out. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happened, Goldberg accepted a job as chief operating officer 
for Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. That required the family to move to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told, or we were under the impression, that the service Westside was 
going to provide would simply be transferred to the Orange County center," 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
But they were shocked to learn that that wasn't true. The Orange County center, 
based in Orange, they were told, had a 32-hour-per-month maximum. Each of the 
state's 21 regional disability centers sets its own guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
So that's when Monica Goldberg came up with what her husband believes is an 
ingenious plan. She asked the center if it would let her take her quota for the 
year all in one month. That would give Jason the constant care he needed until 
the couple could figure out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore said the center agreed "out of empathy for the Goldbergs. There is no 
question that Jason's needs are very serious." 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Goldbergs time to get a state hearing, which they lost, and then 
go to court. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Goldberg believes that the state can win in the end only if the Goldberg 
family wins. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cost the state much, much more for Jason's care if we were forced to 
put him in an institution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials for the Department of Developmental Services in Sacramento 
generally agree. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the individual case, but no question our inclination is to do 
everything possible to keep the child in the home," said Harold Pitchford of 
the department's community services division. 
</P>
<P>
Putting Jason in an institution, even a small residential unit, is out of the 
question for the Goldbergs. One-on-one attention is vital to Jason for him to 
stay alive, they explain. But they also add that sending him away would violate 
their Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
"We are family," Russ Goldberg said. "We wouldn't put one of our other children 
away if something went wrong. We've invested nine years of our lives in Jason. 
We won't give him up now." 
</P>
<P>
If the Goldbergs do win, it's not likely to anger the Orange County center. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide 150 different services to the community; we've had to put our 
priorities in other areas where the needs were," Sizemore said. "If we're told 
that (16-hour nursing care) is what we should be doing, then we'll do it. But 
we will need help. A dozen Jasons would tremendously affect us." 
</P>
<P>
It would mean $150,000 a year probably, he said, compared to the $30,000 spent 
now on most cases. 
</P>
<P>
But the Goldbergs thank attorneys Catherine Blakemore and Marilyn Holley for 
teaching them that parents of the disabled have rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Goldbergs now have an insurance plan that should provide the care their son 
needs, beginning in July. But a court decision in their case, they know, could 
affect other parents. 
</P>
<P>
"God gave us Jason for a reason," Russ Goldberg said.

CHILD-CARE FACILITY NEARS APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoag Hospital officials will go before the Coastal Commission today in Marina 
del Rey to seek approval of a planned 9,000-square-foot, one-story child-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's blessing is likely, according F.W. (Dubby) Evans, the 
hospital's vice president of facilities, design and construction. "The Coastal 
Commission understands the pending need, and they are expected to recommend 
approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The child-care center, which has been in the planning stages for more than four 
years, will be located west of the cancer center that is under construction and 
should be open in August or September. 
</P>
<P>
Free child care would be provided at the center by the hospital for its 
employees.

GANG YOUTHS TEACH THEIR PEERS A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Generally speaking, high schools don't invite convicted criminals onto their 
campuses. But that's exactly what La Quinta High in Westminster did Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four former juvenile offenders from different ethnic gangs in Southern 
California, were on campus as a part of a "Symposium on Ethnic Understanding" 
sponsored by Youth Leadership for Action. The four are all serving sentences at 
California Youth Authority facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, speakers from different Southern California agencies visited 
classes and spoke to students on everything from gang violence to Islamic 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to create understanding of the different cultures (among) the 
students," said Peggy Hai, a 17-year-old senior member of Youth Leadership for 
Action. 
</P>
<P>
The student seminars posed solutions for a city that is no stranger to cultural 
tension. It was the scene of a cross-burning in front of a home owned by a 
black family, and a Jewish temple and a Korean-owned store have been defaced by 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The former gang members, now serving sentences at the Oak Glen Youth 
Conservation Camp in Yucaipa, dropped their racial gang identification and came 
together in a third-period English class to tell students about the dangers of 
drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"For one night of partying, I'm spending three years of my life in jail," said 
Robert Ramirez, 20, a former gang member. Ramirez told the class that everyone 
he knows who is involved in drugs "is going to end up dead, in jail or going 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gilbo, 20, and Eric Savador Hill, 21, stood side by side as they talked 
of their days in well-known rival black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbo advised students to resist the temptation of drugs. "Just be yourself," 
he said. He told them to stand firm against the pressure of their friends or 
"the crowd" to take drugs "because the crowd is going to bring you down." 
</P>
<P>
In a science classroom on the other side of campus, Megan Swezey of the 
Constitutional Rights Foundation opened up the classroom "to really talk about 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Swezey dismissed the notion of Southern California as an ethnic melting pot, 
where all cultures are assimilated into one, and spoke instead of a "cultural 
mosaic" in which the community shares some American culture, but ethnic 
heritage is preserved. JAMES ROBBINS

JOB-SEEKERS TARGET OF NO-PARKING SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to discourage day workers from congregating on city streets to 
solicit jobs, the City Council has authorized the posting of temporary "no 
parking" signs in problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved a resolution introduced by Councilman David John Shawver 
that authorizes city workers to post temporary "no parking" signs on 
unrestricted city streets where traffic problems are caused by job 
solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
The city already has increased its enforcement of existing parking and 
trespassing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the city's present code-enforcement policy on public and 
private property is working, Shawver urged the council to authorize the 
temporary "no parking" zones to discourage day laborers from "spreading out 
from posted intersections to areas where there are no parking or stopping 
restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
The measure now allows city workers to put up temporary signs similar to those 
used in construction zones. The signs will be posted and enforced on a 
day-by-day basis, whenever a particular area becomes a problem, Shawver said.

MAN FOUND IN ALLEY DIES FROM STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old man who had been stabbed once in the chest died after police 
found him in an alley in Anaheim, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrived at 7:05 p.m. Tuesday and found the man in an alley at 219 E. 
Pearson Ave., said Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. The man's name was withheld pending the 
notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said that the stabbing might be related to gangs or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was an Anaheim resident, was stabbed once in the upper chest, 
Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was pronounced dead shortly after he arrived at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the man was stabbed during a scuffle in a parking lot at 
320 E. Orangewood Ave. From there, the victim ran about a block until he 
collapsed in the alley where he was found. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects or a motive.

11-YEAR-OLD HERO WINS RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The few minutes that two robbers hesitated before blindfolding their victim was 
a costly error that landed them behind bars and made a hero of 11-year-old John 
Le. 
</P>
<P>
During those moments, as Le was being hogtied, he saw enough to later 
positively identify two gang members as his assailants and become the 
prosecution's only eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
"Without his testimony I had no case," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jacqueline M. Arroyo, who prosecuted the case last month. "He's an extremely 
bright and remarkable boy . . . a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, in front of about 300 of his fellow students at James Madison 
Elementary School, the 4-foot-tall sixth grader was showered with awards from 
throughout the community and praised for his bravery and courage for testifying 
against his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just something I had to do," Le said, shrugging off the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very proud of him. He is a good role model, and maybe his actions 
will motivate other students to act bravely," said Lynn Crutchley, the school's 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
Le's ordeal began on June 4, a Sunday morning, when he was home alone while his 
parents worked at a nearby swap meet selling electronic merchandise. "I heard a 
knock at the door and went to answer it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he did, two teen-age boys belonging to a gang forced themselves inside, 
jumped on Le and looted the house, according to authorities. They kicked him 
and threatened him with a knife as they tied his hands and feet together with 
telephone cord. But before they were able to blindfold Le, he was able to get a 
good look at the two, remembering such details as scars, jewelry, hair styles 
and voices. 
</P>
<P>
"It was outstanding observation on his part, unlike most crime victims in that 
situation," said Anaheim Police Detective Kahle Switzer. "He's a pretty cool 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
For more than two hours, Le lay bound on the floor as the robbers ransacked the 
house. They left with $4,000 in cash and various electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
After the two fled, the family dog, Lisa, gnawed at the telephone cord to help 
free Le. Once untied, he called his parents who in turn summoned police. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said that law enforcement agencies usually have trouble handling such 
cases people of Vietnamese descent because the victims have a cultural fear 
that the police are corrupt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times they go unreported. Most the time they fear their own kind," 
Switzer said. "But John did an excellent job of coming forward and testifying." 
</P>
<P>
Le said that after he identified the robbers to the police, he felt he had to 
testify, despite his mother's objection. "I knew if I didn't put them away they 
would probably get me back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said Le showed "amazing courage and poise on the witness stand. . . . If 
it wasn't for his testimony, they'd be free right now." The two robbers, 15 and 
17 years old, were sentenced to eight years at a California Youth Authority 
facility. A third attacker, who entered the house after Le was blindfolded, has 
not been captured. 
</P>
<P>
At the school assembly Wednesday, Le was given awards from the school, the 
county district attorney's office, the office of State Sen. John Seymour 
(R-Anaheim) and Westec Security Inc., which gave him a $500 savings bond. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he felt like a hero, Le looked down at the assembly platform, 
smiled and softly said: "Kinda." MATT LAIT

PEOPLE: FEATS OF ADVENTURE DANCE IN HER HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kym Kucera admits that she is a kid at heart and soul. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I have to check myself at school to make sure I act like a teacher, 
not a kid," said the 28-year-old Seal Beach woman and fifth-grade instructor. 
"If I have an opportunity to play, I'm going to play." 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder she feels that way, considering she lives an adventurous life 
that includes rock and mountain climbing, back-packing, roller-skating and five 
triathlons that she finished in fifth, sixth, second, third and first place. 
</P>
<P>
She also won first place overall female in last month's 10-kilometer Seal Beach 
Autumn Run and in August was part of a team that paddled an outrigger canoe 
from Huntington Beach to Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the teacher at Eastwood School in Westminster set a Guinness Book 
of World Records' mark by pedaling a 15-foot-long sea cycle for 25.7 miles from 
Catalina to the Seal Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
She pedaled a bicycle atop two pontoons and connected to a propeller to perform 
the feat. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to have fun and adventure," said Kucera, who trained for a month by 
riding a stationary bicycle for 50 minutes at a time. She also rode the sea 
cycle for two hours around Naples Island in Long Beach. On weekends, she took 
60-mile bicycle trips along the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The training paid off. She completed the rigorous sea cycle ride in a little 
over five hours, averaging a bit more than 5 m.p.h. in sometimes-choppy waters. 
</P>
<P>
Kucera said a school of leaping porpoises kept her company much of the way, 
providing distraction from the punishing pedaling. "My legs got very tired," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the trip came from a friend who challenged her to bike to 
Catalina, Kucera said. "I guess I was ready for an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
On an earlier adventure, Kucera took a summer camp trip to Switzerland that 
ended with her living there for three years -- until her mother suggested that 
she should come home and finish her college education. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there for a summer job and just didn't come back," she said. "It was a 
great experience and an education in itself, since I learned two other 
languages and met a lot of people. But my mother was right." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Cal State Long Beach, Kucera said she also folk dances and serves 
as an assistant scoutmaster for a Los Alamitos Boy Scout troop. 
</P>
<P>
"I go on outings with the Boy Scouts," she said. "I'm an outdoorsy, 
sportsy-type person. I have to be active." During the summer, she works as a 
junior lifeguard instructor. 
</P>
<P>
But Kucera isn't planning another adventure, at least not right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I like fun and exciting things, but I'm going to be a teacher for a while," 
she confided. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the Catalina bike trip, Kucera said she was pleased at the support 
her students gave her. Some, who were studying nutrition in class, kept track 
of her protein and high carbohydrate diet during her training, she said. And a 
bunch of them and their parents showed up at the finish line to cheer her on. 
</P>
<P>
"That really made me feel good," she said. "It was just neat." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Charles (Chip) Margelli, 37, of Garden Grove, traveled to an 
uninhabited island near the Soviet Union with 10 other ham radio operators and 
together made contacts with 41,000 other ham radio operators from 140 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Margelli said, "it was just plain fun and was the highlight of my 
life," despite some primitive accommodations and winds that created havoc with 
the camp site. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the veteran ham radio operator and 11 others in February will take part in 
a 12-day expedition to Bouvet Island near Antarctica, and they hope to make 
75,000 radio contacts during their stay there. 
</P>
<P>
Following the contacts, the operators and the sending team exchange 
confirmation cards that authenticate the contact. 
</P>
<P>
Margelli said ham operators often vie with one another to see who can make the 
most difficult and exotic radio contacts. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Margelli's third expedition. In 1984, he went to China with a team 
of operators. "It really is fun," he said.

CIGARETTE PROMOTION IN KOREAN CENTER ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

On the eve of a national "smokeout," a Korean tobacco company was handing out 
cigarettes Wednesday at a Korean community center in Orange County, promising 
that a portion of any donations would go toward building elderly housing in the 
Los Angeles metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County health official immediately assailed the promotional tactic 
Wednesday, accusing the government-run Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. of 
playing upon the national sentiments of Korean immigrants to increase cigarette 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obscene to me," said Nampet Panichpant-Michelsen, program manager for the 
International Immigrant and Refugee Health Assistance program, an arm of the 
Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the tobacco firm said Wednesday that it was unaware of the 
no-smoking effort, but said the promotional campaign for Korean-made cigarettes 
was intended to benefit Korean communities in the United States, not to build a 
market for the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know about the" Great American Smokeout being held today, Lee Hyung 
Sub, managing director of Overseas Affairs for the privately owned cigarette 
corporation, said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his office in Taejon, 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds for the cigarettes will go to a Korean senior citizens group and to 
sponsor a community anti-crime committee, Lee said. He added that his company 
does not plan to sell cigarettes in the United States until late December. 
</P>
<P>
But Panichpant-Michelsen accused the tobacco company of "dumping" its product 
on new Asian immigrants who may not be aware of the health hazards of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing if you're educated and you make a conscious effort to kill 
yourself," she said. "But it's another if you are doing it because you are not 
sophisticated enough to know you are being manipulated by aggressive 
advertising tactics." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, several promotional posters advertising the cigarettes were 
hanging in the Korean Community Center in Garden Grove. The posters, written in 
Korean, said the company was proud to announce that the cigarettes from the 
"motherland" had arrived, according to a Korean translator who works for the 
county. The posters said the company had donated $30,000 worth of cigarettes 
and the proceeds would be used to build elderly housing. Among the name brands 
advertised were "Eighty-Eights," and "Lilac Slims." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Korean Community Center on Garden Grove Boulevard could not be 
reached for comment on the cigarette promotion. However, county health 
officials said center representatives had been handing out boxes of the 
cigarettes at the senior center for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
Panichpant-Michelson said she learned of the promotion earlier this week when 
she visited the center to ask an official there if he would stop smoking for a 
day during national smokeout week. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached him to see if he would stop smoking for 24 hours and learned that 
(the tobacco company) had dumped $30,000 worth of cigarettes claiming to be low 
tar," she said. "They have been very clever in that they have been able to 
identify the needs of the people. It's so obvious and blatant in terms of the 
aggressive advertising tactics." 
</P>
<P>
She said although the advertisement for the cigarettes is in Korean, the 
Surgeon General's warning is written in English.

3 YEARS' PROBATION GIVEN IN SECURITY SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE EX-OWNER OF A SECURITY FIRM MUST ALSO PAY $220,000 IN FINES AND 
RESTITUTION. HE WAS CHIEF WITNESS IN THE CASH-FOR-INFLUENCE CASE AGAINST TWO 
DEPUTY MARSHALS.

<P>
The former owner of an Orange County security company was placed on probation 
Wednesday and ordered to pay $220,000 in fines and restitution for funneling 
cash to two deputy U.S. marshals who helped him keep a lucrative security 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Rydzewski, 34, of Santa Ana, admitted participating in the 
cash-for-influence scheme and emerged as the chief witness against the two 
ex-deputy marshals. According to Rydzewski's testimony, the two accepted more 
than $7,600 from him in exchange for their assistance in getting and keeping 
Ryszewski's no-bid, $400,000 contract to protect evidence and guard witnesses 
in federal cases from 1982 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The two former deputy marshals, Joseph Gieniec of Santa Ana and Gordon Tornberg 
of Tustin, who worked at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles, were convicted 
in September of accepting illegal gratuities. They face sentencing Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Rydzewski's guilty plea in July to three counts of paying 
illegal gratuities to government employees, prosecutors recommended Wednesday 
that U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts place him on probation, a move that 
surprised the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Letts said he considered the recommendation "extraordinary" in light of the 
seriousness of the crime. Letts said he wondered if Rydzewski had "colored" his 
testimony to suit the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very troubled at the prospect that judicial justice might bear no relation 
at all to what really happened," Letts said. "Was I listening to the version of 
the truth most favorable (to the government) or was I listening to what really 
happened?" Letts asked. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie M. Bennett Jr., a lawyer from the Department of Justice's public 
integrity section, said he believed that Rydzewski told the truth on the stand 
and that he had been very helpful to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Letts then turned to Rydzewski, saying he was willing to trust the government 
and release him without jail time, but he said it was a "very difficult" 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"You're getting all there is and perhaps more than you're entitled to," Letts 
said. "I'm trusting them, just about as much against my best judgment as I ever 
have. I don't want to be wrong. . . . If I ever see or hear a bad word about 
you, I'm going to be stricken." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Letts placed Rydzewski on three years' probation, fined him $10,000 
and ordered him to pay $210,000 in restitution to the government. Defense 
attorney Ronald G. Brower said Rydzewski agreed to the restitution to cover 
overcharges he submitted to the government on his contract.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCIL MAKES MOVE TO EASE THE RAISING OF WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has moved a step closer to increasing local water rates with 
the adoption of a new amendment changing the way such rates are raised. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the council voted to change water rates by means of a 
resolution, instead of an ordinance. A resolution can take effect in 30 days, 
compared to 90 days for ordinances, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Fox, the city's fiscal services manager, said the council probably 
would consider an increase in water rates at the beginning of the year. Rates 
have not been increased since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"At the current time, the operating costs of the water fund are exceeding the 
revenue," Fox said. "So some changes will probably have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said the amendment was part of the council's effort to update many of the 
city's 25-year-old codes. 
</P>
<P>
"This just makes it a lot easier to modify and change the codes," Fox said.

HARVEY A DRIVING FORCE OF THE WATER POLO TEAM 
</P>

<P>
Five years ago, Julian Harvey jumped into the Laguna Hills High School pool 
every afternoon for water polo practice, only to watch his team slowly sink 
into the deep end of lost causes. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Laguna Hills was not a water polo power. Unlike some schools, the 
team did not benefit from feeder programs or booster clubs, and it didn't get 
much support from the student body. This, and the team's generally apathetic 
nature, frustrated Harvey to no end. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very bad program, a very weak program," Harvey said. "The exposure 
wasn't there and neither was the motivation. I'd watch the other teams play, 
get excited. We were, well . . . low key." 
</P>
<P>
Now Harvey is one of the top players for UC Irvine, a perennial power and 
currently the nation's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (23-6 overall, 7-2 in the Big West Conference) will travel to 
Indianapolis next week for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. water polo 
championships Nov. 24-26. Irvine, which has competed in 17 of the previous 20 
NCAA championship tournaments, has finished in the top five 15 times and won 
the title in 1970 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, a fifth-year senior and a member of the U.S. national team, is UCI's 
second-leading scorer with 71 goals; senior Tom Warde leads with 91. Harvey and 
Warde share the "hole man" position, similar to the center in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Warde, who has been friends with Harvey since the two were 9-year-old junior 
lifeguards at Huntington Beach, said: "In high school, Julian was the whole 
team. Now that he's with a winning program, he's able to get fired up. He's 
came a long way, but he's always been a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Good enough to be invited, as a high school senior, to a youth development camp 
sponsored by United States Water Polo, the national governing body. It was at 
the camp that Harvey learned what winning water polo was all about. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the players was better, the caliber was way up there," Harvey 
said. "Everything was more intense." 
</P>
<P>
When Harvey brought back what he had learned, namely the camp's conditioning 
drills, to his high school team, few were interested. "My coach thought I was 
out in left field and (the players) wanted to go play their video games or 
something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Coach Boyd Philpot, a former All-American at UC Irvine, was one of the 
camp's directors. He said Harvey stood out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Since his team didn't make the playoffs, no one knew about him except people 
in his league," Philpot said. "But when he came down here, I called (Irvine 
Coach Ted) Newland. I said this kid is strong, talented and motivated . . . a 
diamond in the rough." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Harvey, who had originally planned to attend Saddleback College, 
ended up at Irvine. "When I first heard about Irvine I said, 'Irvine? What's 
Irvine?' " he said. Harvey learned soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Newland runs one of the nation's toughest water polo programs. Try 1,200 
sit-ups every morning, five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely culture shock when I got there," Harvey said. "You never get 
used to waking up at 5:30." 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey excelled, becoming the team's only freshman to play in 1985. At the 
NCAA championships that year, Harvey gained valuable experience, playing nearly 
an entire game when one of the team's upperclassmen fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harvey said the transition from high school to college play was a 
shock, Newland disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, to me, he always wanted to be good, and so consequently, I think he 
knew what it would take," Newland said. "He's always been an intense player, 
he's a very intense person. It's what he wanted. He was looking for that." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, there wasn't a lot of drive," Harvey said. "But I'm definitely 
driven to win the NCAAs. That's something we (seniors) have never done. To win 
it would be everything." 
</P>
<P>
And this time, Harvey has 11 teammates that share his desire. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine women's cross-country team travels to Annapolis, Md., for Monday's 
NCAA championships with the highest hopes in the team's history. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Anteaters' national ranking dropped from seventh to 12th after 
finishing second to Washington in the NCAA Region 8 meet at Fresno last 
Saturday, Coach Vince O'Boyle says the Anteaters are capable of placing much 
higher. Irvine has competed in the national championships twice, with its best 
finish -- eighth -- coming in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting to nationals has been a common goal for us all year," O'Boyle said. 
"That dream is now becoming reality. My dream is that this team can place in 
the top six or top five." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Buffy Rabbitt led Irvine in the regional meet by winning the individual 
title, becoming the first Irvine woman to do so. Rabbitt, who as a freshman 
became Irvine's first female cross-country All-American in 1987, was about 
three strides behind the leader, USC's Amy Goodwin, with 300 yards to go. 
</P>
<P>
That's when O'Boyle said the right thing to Rabbitt. "I said, 'Buf! Make two 
quick strides and catch her!' " O'Boyle said. Rabbitt did, and passed Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rabbitt: "I thought, 'Well, I'm right here, I might as well try.' When 
Vince told me to go, I tried to kick for dear life. . . . I was very 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The women's volleyball team, which plays host to Fresno State Saturday in its 
final Big West match this season, is led by senior Ali Wood with 455 kills. 
Irvine is 17-13 overall and 5-11 in the Big West, but Coach Mike Puritz said he 
hopes the NCAA selection committee will consider his team for a playoff bid. . 
. . Former Anteater tennis standout Mike Briggs recently returned from a month 
of competition in Hawaii, where he played four tournaments on Oahu, Maui and 
Kona. In the past week, he won the Masters Week tournament and earned 17 points 
in the Assn. of Tennis Professionals' ratings. According to his pro coach, Dave 
Heffern, Briggs -- who leaves for a tournament in San Paulo, Brazil, on Dec. 4 
-- will probably move up from 460 to 350 in the world rankings. . . . 
Basketball Coach Bill Mulligan on the good and bad state of Anteater hoops: 
"We're encouraged. We see a lot of positive things. I'm trying not to dwell on 
the negatives." And: "We've spent four weeks practicing, but we still have guys 
who don't know what we're doing."

LAS VEGAS ISN'T NO. 1 IN BIG WEST; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CONFERENCE COACHES PICK CAL STATE LONG BEACH AHEAD OF THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS' TOP-RANKED TEAM IN THE NATION.

Nevada Las Vegas is the No. 1-ranked men's basketball team in the nation, 
according to the Associated Press preseason poll. But the Big West coaches 
voted the Runnin' Rebels second in the conference Wednesday, picking Cal State 
Long Beach as the preseason favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Five coaches picked Long Beach as the No. 1 team and four picked UNLV in what 
one coach joked was "a conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
A media poll had UNLV first with 41 of 44 first-place votes, followed by UC 
Santa Barbara and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV returns the core of a team that made it to the final eight of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament last season. It also has one of the 
nation's top newcomers in community college transfer Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"They might be No. 1 in the nation, but they're not No. 1 in the Big West," 
Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm said. Pimm and other coaches are sensitive to 
the perception that the conference is UNLV and a crowd of others. Pimm pointed 
out that several of UNLV's top players, including David Butler and Moses 
Scurry, were not with the team in its opener against Loyola Marymount Wednesday 
night because of academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harrington, coach of the Long Beach team that edged UNLV for first place in 
the coaches' poll, said he picked his own team fourth, behind UNLV, Cal State 
Fullerton and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has a roster filled with new names, including highly regarded Kevin 
Cutler, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound junior who was the Arizona junior college player 
of the year in 1988 and sat out last season. 
</P>

in a poll of Big West Conference women's coaches.

SCHUSTER TAKES A BREAK, THEN TAKES OFF

<P>
Laurie Schuster is on the road again. 
</P>
<P>
But judging from her cross-country success this season, it's hard to believe 
that the Occidental College junior is on the comeback trail. 
</P>
<P>
Schuster never won a league title when she was running cross-country for Irvine 
High School, nor did she win a race in two previous seasons at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, Schuster was unbeaten in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? 
</P>
<P>
After competing, without a break, in cross-country and track since her freshman 
year in high school, Schuster nixed her Nikes last winter, sat out the track 
season and turned her thoughts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
She returned this fall revitalized and ran away with the SCIAC title. She never 
lost in a dual meet and beat her nearest competitor at the conference 
championships by 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Every race I'm feeling stronger and stronger," Schuster said. "Last year, I 
was getting burned out -- I needed that break to remember why I was running. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been doing it for so long, I kind of forgot that I actually enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Schuster endured 90-degree temperatures to place third at the 
NCAA Division III West regionals at UC Santa Cruz, covering the 5,000-meter 
course in 19 minutes 4 seconds. Schuster's finish qualified her for the 
national championships on Saturday in Rock Island, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Harvey, who is in his 11th season coaching cross-country at Occidental, 
said Schuster always had the physical ability to run the way she has this 
season. He said getting off the track helped Schuster clear a mental hurdle and 
gain confidence in herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows why she's out here and what she wants out of it," Harvey said. "When 
you start at a young age, sometimes it just becomes a habitual activity rather 
than something that you're really enjoying the way that you should. 
</P>
<P>
"The time off helped her realize that." 
</P>
<P>
Schuster, 20, started running in the seventh grade with her father, John, who 
jogged to stay in shape. In high school, she earned all-South Coast League 
recognition while competing all four years for the Irvine varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Individual titles, however, eluded her. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like there was always someone else there that was unbeatable," 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
It was much the same case when Schuster arrived at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Trimble, a three-time All-American who graduated last year, never lost 
a SCIAC race in four years with the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
During her freshman season, Schuster ran in the shadows of Trimble and other 
more experienced teammates and finished fifth at the conference championship 
meet. As it turned out, that also was where Schuster peaked. Two weeks later -- 
on a hilly Crystal Springs course in San Mateo -- she finished 13th at the 
regional championships. 
</P>
<P>
That meet marked the beginning of a long, frustrating year for Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
She had cramping problems throughout her sophomore season, placed seventh at 
the regionals, then finished 97th in the Division III national meet in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to force it out of myself," Schuster said of her effort, "and I just 
bombed." 
</P>
<P>
With Harvey's approval, Schuster bypassed the track season and took two terms 
of karate, "getting myself completely out of shape for running." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through last summer, Schuster saw an off-road truck race on television 
at her parents' house in Danville, Calif. She watched the vehicles fly off the 
bumpy terrain and decided it was time to get back on the road herself.

"The thought of being in a race again was all of a sudden so appealing," 
Schuster said. "My heart started beating faster and I'm like, 'Oh, I've got to 
go out there and run.' 
</P>
<P>
"Working myself back into shape was the neatest feeling. It made me go, 'This 
is why I run.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harvey hopes Schuster will maintain her new joy for running through the 
upcoming track season and her final cross-country season next year. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just now starting to blossom," Harvey said. "I think she's going to be 
much better in another year because when you work in this atmosphere -- in this 
frame of mind -- for a year or so, then good things really begin to happen."

COMPANY WILL SELL ITS 7-MINUTE AIDS TEST KIT IN SWEDEN

Disease Detection International of Irvine has been given approval to sell test 
kits in Sweden that, according to the company, indicate in just seven minutes 
whether someone is infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the speediest test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to win 
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is one that takes about 90 
minutes. Disease Detection said it intends to apply for FDA approval for its 
seven-minute kit early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Each kit is about the size of a credit card. To use it, a drop of blood is 
placed on the surface, to which a clinician adds several chemicals. Infection 
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is indicated by a blue dot. 
</P>
<P>
Disease Detection President and Chief Executive H. Thad Morris said these kits 
are not intended for home use. The reason, Morris said, is the prevailing 
belief that HIV diagnoses should be made in settings where professional 
guidance is available. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tests should only be used in the hands of professionals," Morris said.

KOLL CO. NEGOTIATING LAND BUY FROM UNION PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Koll Co. is negotiating to buy thousands of acres in the Midwest and on the 
West Coast from Union Pacific Corp., the giant railroad company, in a deal that 
could total several hundred million dollars, analysts and real estate sources 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company would confirm the talks. But Union Pacific said last week it 
had given Koll exclusive rights for eight days to look at the real estate and 
make an offer. That period expired Friday with no further word from either 
company. 
</P>
<P>
But real estate executives and stock analysts who follow Union Pacific said 
negotiations continued into this week. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts put the value of Union Pacific's land at around $350 million, and the 
company has maintained it might be worth much more. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific said in April it would sell 25,000 acres in urban areas such as 
Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Las Vegas, Denver, Portland, Ore., and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., is considered by analysts to be well-run. 
But it's an anemic performer on the stock market. (Its stock closed Wednesday 
at $73.375, down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.) That's because it 
is so diverse that investors find it difficult to figure out whether the 
company's stock price is a good buy. 
</P>
<P>
So, the analysts said, Union Pacific decided to sell some businesses for which 
it could get good prices but which were holding the stock price down. Real 
estate was such a business, analysts said, because it tends to be more valuable 
when held over the long term rather than as a quick generator of the big 
earnings prized so much by investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate doesn't really fit into an earnings-based company," said Anthony 
B. Hatch, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific is anxious to make a deal before the end of the year, Hatch said. 
The company said last week it expected to negotiate a month or more even if 
Koll made an offer quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Archibald Jacobson, president of Union Pacific Realty Co. -- the railroad's 
real estate subsidiary -- said in a letter to employees last week that there 
were "other interested bidders" if the Koll deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific Realty earned $31.2 million last year on revenue of $95 million. 
But this year, with some of its real estate markets weak, Union Pacific's 
nine-month earnings fell to $9 million. That is compared to $19 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Koll is one of the largest developers and property owners on the West Coast 
with a portfolio of properties it says is worth $4 billion. Some of Union 
Pacific's landholdings dovetail nicely with Koll offices in Seattle, Portland 
and San Diego, while other holdings in Denver and Chicago might allow Koll to 
move its development business eastward. Koll recently opened a Dallas office in 
a move to expand off the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where Koll got its start, the company built many of the glass 
office towers around John Wayne Airport and is credited with turning that area 
into a flourishing business center. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, privately held Koll didn't buy buildings it hadn't 
developed. In the last few years, however, Koll has bought the property 
division of Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Co. and the $300 million worth of property in 
the portfolio of Wells Fargo Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust, the largest purchase 
in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific, meanwhile, bought much of its land years ago as part of its 
railroad operations. In the mid-1970s Union Pacific spun off its real estate 
operations as a separate subsidiary, which began developing industrial 
buildings such as factories and warehouses, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Lately the company has begun to develop more elaborate and expensive office 
buildings, most of them low-rise. The assets for sale include about 50 
buildings, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the company's land is in or near major urban areas, said Robert Decker, 
an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. A major development corridor 
west of Chicago, for instance, includes a lot of Union Pacific land, he said. 
And the company also owns a train terminal and 235 acres in downtown Las Vegas 
that could be extremely valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"By selling this stuff they're basically trying to focus the company better and 
let investors perceive it more easily," Decker said. "They're selling 
businesses that have good assets and will bring them a good price, but that 
don't show up in the stock price."

Seeing Ahead: Allergan Inc. recently told analysts in New York that it expects 
a rough 1990 in part because of public warnings about the adverse side effects 
of extended-wear contact lenses. The Food and Drug Administration recently 
recommended that those using such lenses wear them for no longer than seven 
days before removing them for a night because studies indicate that wearing 
them continuously for longer periods could be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based eye care company is also facing an increased competition. "The 
trends in the eye care market and the continuing impact of competitive lens 
care systems have led to difficulties during 1989 which will likely continue 
into 1990," Gavin Herbert, Allergan chairman and chief executive officer, told 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan stock has been sliding since Nov. 9, when Herbert made his remarks. On 
Wednesday, the company's stock closed at $15.875, down 25 cents. On the day 
before Herbert's presentation to analysts, by contrast, Allergan closed at 
$18.625. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the third quarter rose 14% to $29.4 million; revenue was up 9% to 
$206.4 million.

RIEGLE ACKNOWLEDGES CLOSER CONNECTION TO LINCOLN S&amp;L 
</P>

<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), who has sought to minimize his ties to the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, has acknowledged a deeper involvement with 
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and four other senators are 
the subject of preliminary reviews by the Senate Ethics Committee and the FBI 
because of their connections to Keating and their actions on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle was one of five senators who intervened with regulators on Keating's 
behalf at an April 9, 1987, meeting about Irvine-based Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
That meeting, and a meeting a week earlier that Riegle did not attend, have 
become important to a congressional probe of Lincoln's collapse. Their 
intervention has been blamed by some for the delay in taking regulatory action 
against Lincoln, which was seized in April amid charges of fraud and misuse of 
depositor money. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan Democrat has insisted that he attended the April 9 meeting about 
Irvine-based Lincoln only at the request of Senate colleagues who sought his 
presence as "a banking resource person." Riegle has contended that he was 
basically a bystander at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Karolyn Wallace, Riegle's press secretary, disclosed Tuesday that nearly a 
month earlier, Riegle toured the firm's parent company in Phoenix. Two weeks 
later, on March 23, 1987, Keating sponsored a Detroit fund-raising luncheon for 
Riegle, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Lincoln and its parent firm, Phoenix-based American Continental 
Corp., gave Riegle $78,250 in campaign donations at the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle returned Keating's donations after it was disclosed by the Detroit News 
last year, saying he wanted to avoid "an appearance of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
The previously undisclosed meeting between Riegle and Keating plus other recent 
revelations show that Riegle's relationship with Keating were closer than 
Riegle has publicly indicated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the newly revealed Arizona visit, Riegle did not advise the 
ethics committee of two other Lincoln-related contacts in the weeks before the 
April, 1987, meeting with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The other senators under scrutiny for their involvement in the Lincoln case are 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and 
John Glenn (D-Ohio).

REAL ESTATE: A CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT PLANNED BY DREW PEARSON'S STEPSON HAS 
SET ASIDE ACREAGE FOR A FEW FOUR-LEGGED RESIDENTS.

Condominiums for horses! At prices ranging from $400,000 to $900,000 per lot 
for accompanying humans, only we poor peasants could say nay to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
As we rein in the puns, let it be said that it's all true. Merry-Go-Round Farm, 
off River Road in Potomac, Md. -- bought with the proceeds of Drew Pearson's 
investigative (he called it "muckraking") newspaper column, for which it was 
named -- has been a great jumping-off place for Democratic parties for almost 
60 years. Now lawyer Tyler Abell (Pearson's stepson and President Lyndon B. 
Johnson's protocol chief) is creating 79 building plots, 50 horse stalls (first 
come, first stabled), a pasture and innumerable squirrel leaps. It is much like 
taking a great mansion and turning it into condominiums, with the ballroom and 
garden to be shared by all. 
</P>
<P>
The refuge, 18 miles from the White House by Abell's odometer, is spectacularly 
situated on a rural promontory overlooking the Potomac River. For 50 years or 
so, it has served as the weekend destination for Pearson's widow, Luvie 
Pearson; her son, Tyler Abell; Tyler's wife Bess Abell, Lady Bird Johnson's 
social secretary and Joan Mondale's chief of staff; their two sons, Lyndon and 
Dan Tyler Abell; six dogs and 20 horses; a 12-week-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
Those who made brief for brief starring appearances include former President 
Lyndon Johnson, former Chief Justice Earl Warren, former vice presidents and 
presidential candidates Henry Wallace and Walter Mondale, and movie star Rita 
Hayworth. Not to mention the Democratic Government in Exile. 
</P>
<P>
Drew Pearson came to Washington to work for the Baltimore Sun in the 1920s. In 
1930 he and Robert S. Allen anonymously wrote a book, "Washington 
Merry-Go-Round." With their second, "More Merry-Go-Round," the Sun fired 
Anderson, and the two started the famous column (now Jack Anderson's) in 1932. 
It first appeared here in Cissy Patterson's Washington Times-Herald. Pearson 
took Patterson's daughter, Felicia Gizycka, as his bride, and they had a child, 
Ellen. That marriage lasted only three years. Pearson then met and got married 
to Luvie Moore, a movie critic). Pearson continued to get along with Cissy -- 
for a while. They didn't break up until 1942, when he began supporting Franklin 
D. Roosevelt and the effort to have the United States join the Allies against 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, this is all by way of explaining that while the newspaper publisher and 
the columnist were friends, he found the Potomac farm for her. She bought it 
for $50,000 in 1930. When she later bought Dower House in Prince George's 
County, Md., she gave the Montgomery County land to her granddaughter, Ellen, 
with Pearson as trustee. He eventually bought it from his daughter when she 
moved to California, and in 1939 he built the hillside farmhouse there now. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when he tried to run it as a dairy farm and Victory Garden to help 
the war effort," Abell said. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson used to sell muck -- the bottom of the old canal bed -- from the farm. 
A big sign on River Road offered "Drew Pearson's Manure, All Cow, No Bull, 
Better Than the Column." 
</P>
<P>
"My stepfather -- before he died in 1969 -- and I realized we wouldn't be able 
to hold onto the 204 acres forever. We'd have to develop it," Abell says now. 
"But it's taken a long time to work out. I went all over the country looking at 
other such developments. It took forever to get the plans through the 
Montgomery County requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Abell says he thinks the plan he has worked out with Colden Florance of Keyes 
Condon Florance Architects and landscape design consultant Edward Alexander is 
"perhaps the only kind in the country." The people get a bit more than a half 
acre each. The horses will have 150, minus that devoted to Tyler's Puddle, 
Luvie's Lake, Drew's Lake and the human residents' two to four tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
The houses will not be allowed to interfere with the horse trails or with the 
remarkable views. Each contract will be accompanied by the Merry-Go-Round Farm 
Architectural and Landscape Design Guidelines by Florance with architect Brian 
Harner. The guidelines are a short course (well, at 76 pages, maybe not so 
short) in architectural styles and philosophy, obviously bent on protecting the 
acreage from the kinds of filthy-rich nighttime-soap-set excesses so visible in 
the houses on nearby River Road. 
</P>
<P>
The preamble notes: "The intention is to avoid two extremes to which ordinary 
residential developments frequently succumb: either a monotonous repetition of 
house types that suppress individuality and imagination, or an uncoordinated 
cacophony of misunderstood historic styles with awkward massing and siting." 
</P>
<P>
Before people can start to wonder what they can put up, the preamble adds: 
"While certain styles may be preferred, any style may be introduced subject to 
the approval of the Architectural Committee." Then it goes on to list pages of 
designs for windows and details. There is even a three-page list of sanctioned 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Merry-Go-Round might be said to serve quasi millionaires -- those with enough 
money to acquire a taste of country estate, but not enough to afford to pay for 
all of it by themselves. The prices of people sites will range from $400,000 
for each of five or six lots in the woods to $900,000 for the three with the 
views of the Potomac, the Virginia shore and the Appalachians. Twenty-three 
sites are being offered now, but Abell says he will eventually carve out 56 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers will own their building sites. The 150 acres, however, will belong to 
the Merry-Go-Round owners association. The $200-a-month fee will pay for a farm 
staff of five, maintenance of the tennis courts (two are almost finished, and 
two more planned), barns (two now, another one e planned), trails and roads, 
two snowplows and two trucks, plus grass mowing. ("We didn't want anyone mowing 
the grass when their neighbors are giving a party," Abell says.) 
</P>
<P>
Stabling for the horses will cost another $200 a month. There is pasturage for 
probably 50 horses, Abell said. Some people, therefore, will have to keep their 
spare horses elsewhere. No extra charge for dogs, or cats, though. No limit to 
the squirrels, snakes, birds or crickets. 
</P>
<P>
Luvie Pearson is keeping the farmhouse and its 10 or so surrounding acres. The 
Abells have a five-acre site with the former dairyman's house. They're living 
in the main house at the farm. 
</P>
<P>
("I agreed to try it for a year," said Bess Abell.) In the meantime, they're 
renting out their Georgetown house, next to Luvie Pearson's. Tom Hulce, star of 
"A Few Good Men" at the Kennedy Center, is the current tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, they're giving their kingdom for a horse.

They squeeze into spaces barely big enough to breathe in, searching for victims 
of earthquakes, hurricanes or mudslides. And they do it for a dog biscuit or a 
pat on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue dogs, trained to pick up human scent in the air, sniff out 
victims before rescue crews bulldoze their way through the rubble of a natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We can put them into an area where we have no idea who may be lost," says Mark 
A. Pennington, who helps coordinate the dog teams through the Virginia 
Department of Emergency Services, "and they'll find any human being in that 
area."

<P>
Actually, Pennington says the dogs are successful about 75% of the time. "They 
can have a bad day just like anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
The department has coordinated 148 searches in Virginia since January, 
including those for downed aircraft and people missing in wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Pennington and Ralph E. Wilfong, who heads the search and rescue division, also 
sent teams on earthquake missions to Mexico City in 1985, El Salvador in 1986 
and Armenia last December. 
</P>
<P>
Teams were sent to aid in the Puerto Rico mudslides of 1985 and most recently 
to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas. They offered to 
help with the San Francisco earthquake rescue, but workers managed without 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a very good dog, it can differentiate between a live and a dead 
victim," says Pennington's wife, Winnie, assistant program manager of the 
search and rescue unit. 
</P>
<P>
Most dog teams adhere to standards that are being developed on the national 
level. Dogs used for search and rescue missions average 3 years of age and 
represent various breeds. They generally work until they're about 8 or 9, but 
some work well into their teens. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be shepherds were the best breed," Pennington says. "But now 
they're using anything, as long as it's a working or hunting-class dog. We have 
everything from mastiffs to Newfoundlands. Labrador retrievers are popular, 
because they're very gentle dogs, particularly when dealing with children and 
old people." 
</P>
<P>
A dog must be proficient at wilderness rescues and undergo two years of 
training before it is ready for disaster work. 
</P>
<P>
"For disaster work, they do an extensive amount of agility training for the 
dogs," Winnie Pennington says. "People think a dog can automatically jump over 
a fence or jump through a small opening, but that's not true. Dogs can't 
naturally do that. They have to learn how to use their pads and their claws a 
certain way to be able to balance." 
</P>
<P>
The animals must also learn to travel in all sorts of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know whether you're going to be riding in the back of a pickup truck 
or hoisted in by helicopter," Pennington says. "All the dogs have to be 
operational -- airworthy -- in all modes of air transportation." 
</P>
<P>
During the Hugo mission, dogs, equipment and handlers were loaded onto a C-130 
cargo plane while the engines were running full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
"The dogs have to be pretty self-controlled to function in that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But the animal is only half the story. No dog search team is complete without 
the handler, in most cases the dog's owner, who is a volunteer trained and 
certified in rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
Each handler provides his own food, water and shelter. "We'll provide the 
transportation," Pennington says. 
</P>
<P>
Handlers must be able to find their way out of the woods, survive in all sorts 
of weather and know first aid, because they often are the first people to reach 
a victim. 
</P>
<P>
No dogs have been killed during a rescue, though one was hit by a car during a 
wilderness search. 
</P>
<P>
But danger is ever present for dogs as well as handlers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on the rubble piles along with the dogs," Pennington says. "A lot of 
times they go into the buildings. In the case of an earthquake, if there's an 
aftershock while they're in the building, that's it."

SCIENCE MAKING GAINS IN MEMORY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK D. ROYLANCE, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much about the workings of memory remains mysterious. But scientists are 
learning more about its biology and operation. 
</P>
<P>
"You can think of memory, or remembering, as a set of mental events very 
similar to perception," said Fergus Craik, of the University of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
When we perceive something, our brains take in information from our senses and 
compare it with our storehouse of knowledge -- our memories -- in order to make 
sense out of the information and act on it. 
</P>
<P>
When we try to remember something without input from our senses, he said, "we 
try to reconstruct from the inside some faint copy or simulation of the 
processes that went on at the time of the original perception. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it is very literal -- a face, or the layout of a room. In other 
cases, it is not so much the surface aspects, but what we abstracted from the 
perception," for example, whether it was good or bad, threatening or benign. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists no longer believe that whole memories are tucked away like file 
folders in four or five cells at a discreet location in the brain. That idea 
originated in now-discredited experiments with patients who reported vivid 
childhood memories when surgeons touched points in their brains with tiny 
electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
Modern imaging of brain cell electrical activity and blood flow, Craik said, 
shows that "it's more accurate to think of memory as being widely distributed 
within the brain, probably with a tremendous amount of overlap . . . just as 
perception is a very widespread activation in the brain. There's a network of 
neurons which, when activated, will give us the experience of remembering." 
</P>
<P>
Individual brain cells, or neurons, probably play a role in a variety of 
perceptions and memories, he said, much as the 26 letters of the alphabet can 
be combined with others to form hundreds of thousands of words. With billions 
of brain neurons to work with, "we've got, for all practical purposes, an 
infinite number of combinations of neurons." 
</P>
<P>
Just how we manage to activate a precise combination of neurons to dredge up a 
memory isn't clear. Certain pathways are "hard-wired" at birth, but most seem 
to be established through the interworking of the senses and experience through 
the learning process. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a particular network of neurons becomes associated with some meaning or 
experience, by whatever means the network is activated, it will again give rise 
to one experience and to some extent the meaning," Craik said. "We build up our 
perceptual world from there." 
</P>
<P>
New experiences can "color," alter or rearrange the old memory pathways, 
adjusting them to fit the new information. The neural connections are also 
vulnerable to damage and decay. 
</P>
<P>
Brain surgery, alcohol, distractions, injury and strokes can wipe out parts of 
memories, or the capacity to process memories. And memory loss is a natural 
part of aging. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies are engaged in a billion-dollar race to develop drugs 
that will enhance brain cell performance, Craik said. But "at present , there 
is nothing that everybody agrees really works."

MADE-FOR-TV MOVIES MAKE THE SMALL SCREEN BIGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WISEHART, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two things happened when Ronald Reagan starred in the first made-for-television 
movie 25 years ago: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The movie never made it to television. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reagan went into politics. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was "The Killers," a remake of a 1946 film with Burt Lancaster and 
Ava Gardner based on a short story by Ernest Hemingway. Co-starring Angie 
Dickinson, Lee Marvin and John Cassavetes, it featured Reagan as a brutal crime 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
"The Killers" wouldn't raise an eyebrow today, but in 1964 it was deemed too 
violent for television, and Universal released it to theaters instead. Now it 
makes excellent trivia with which to dazzle your friends. 
</P>
<P>
When "The Killers" misfired, it fell to John Forsythe to star in the first 
television movie actually to get on the air when NBC broadcast "See How They 
Run" on Oct. 7, 1964. With Senta Berger, Leslie Nielsen, Jane Wyatt, George 
Kennedy and Franchot Tone, it was a chase drama about three orphans who don't 
know they're carrying crucial information about an international crime 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, while we weren't looking, the made-for-television movie had its 25th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer numbers may surprise you. The networks -- and lately, 
cable-television entities from Home Box Office to the USA Network -- have 
combined to make more than 2,000 television movies. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone who watched last season's most popular television movie, "The Karen 
Carpenter Story," paid $5 each to see it, the movie would have grossed $200 
million, rarefied atmosphere known to only a handful of blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
True, anyone who pays five bucks to see a clunker like that is cuckoo. But was 
it any worse than, say, "Great Balls of Fire," Dennis Quaid's awful turn as 
Jerry Lee Lewis, the story of a Southern goof with the world's worst dye job 
who plays the piano like he's trying to tenderize a cheap steak? 
</P>
<P>
As the numbers indicate, the reach of made-for-television movie is 
extraordinary, even if the quality sometimes isn't. Watch the umpteenth Brady 
Bunch reunion or cavort with the aging residents of "Gilligan's Island" in "The 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir on Gilligan's Island" and you'll wonder if 25 years of 
television movies isn't 25 years too many. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be discouraged. Scattered among the flotsam, jetsam and general time 
filler over the years are movies that stand tall and look good by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's wonderful work done in television movies," said Allen 
Sabinson, who, as the man in charge of ABC's television movies and miniseries, 
will make 24 of them this season, about twice the number of feature films most 
of the major film studios will make. 
</P>
<P>
Was that a self-serving statement? You bet. But even Sabinson concedes that 
there are built-in problems: Artificial time constraints, censorship that 
limits language, violence and sex, plus commercial breaks that bring the movie 
to a screeching halt while somebody peddles denture cream. 
</P>
<P>
There's a huge difference in the money that goes into feature films and 
television movies. The average film costs $15 to $16 million, while the typical 
two-hour television movie starts at around $3 million and might go up to $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference between what it actually costs to make the movies isn't as 
great as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
Take star salaries. If you spend $8 million to get Sylvester Stallone in your 
movie, all you've got is an $8-million presence and you haven't shot a frame of 
film yet. Pair Robert Redford with Meryl Streep and you've already spent $10 
million-plus and you don't have a movie, a script, a set or a catering service. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's marketing, the act of promoting the movie. That can easily 
double the cost of a feature film. It costs money to buy those television 
commercials and take out those ads in newspapers, especially when the 
advertising campaign lasts for months. It is not unusual for half the budget of 
a $30-million movie to be spent on promotion. Add star salaries, and the cash 
that goes into actually making the movie isn't as much as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the networks typically promote a television movie for a maximum of 
two weeks and the air time costs nothing because ABC, NBC and CBS are promoting 
themselves on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some other obvious other differences, too," noted Sabinson. "There's 
a distinct difference in the audiences. The feature-film audience is younger. 
The television audience is in the 20-to-45-year-old range, for the most part, 
and the core of the loyal television-movie audience tends to be women." 
</P>
<P>
The result is that "The Lady Forgets," a hackneyed Donna Mills movie with 
amnesia plot number 547, trashes "The Final Days," a terrific television movie 
based on the Bob Woodward-Carl Bernstein book about the last months of the 
Nixon Administration. Ratings have shown, time and time again, that this 
audience prefers the romance-novel equivalent of television movies. And Nixon 
blubbering doesn't fit into this category. 
</P>
<P>
The discouraging part of the equation is that it also explains why there's so 
much sludge on the air like "The Lady Forgets." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "I think the huge amounts of money involved in making 
feature films leads the studios to be very cautious in the kinds of projects 
they do," said Sabinson. "We can do a variety of things. Most studios don't 
have that freedom. If they don't have a hit, then they've failed." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is suggesting that the typical television movie should be framed and 
planted on a wall in the Louvre. The point is that many of them are better than 
they get credit for being. 
</P>
<P>
There is some disagreement about exactly what a television movie is. The 
networks say a broadcast that runs four hours over two nights is a long movie, 
not a miniseries. Except that they sometimes revert to calling it a miniseries. 
It's all arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
With the video revolution there can be so many versions of these movies -- or 
short miniseries, if you prefer -- that it becomes confusing. The original 
version of "The Executioner's Song," Norman Mailer's story about Utah murderer 
Gary Gilmore, which made my best list, was broadcast in two-hour blocks over 
two nights. Without commercials, it was three hours and 20 minutes long. 
</P>
<P>
A theatrical version was released in Europe that ran 97 minutes. Both versions 
can be seen in syndication and both are out on videotape. There's even a third 
version, though it's hard to find. It's a mix of the two others that comes in 
at two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, this isn't "The Executioner's Song," it's "The Executioner's 
Chorus." 
</P>
<P>
Television movies were born out of necessity. It wasn't until 1961 that the 
major studios released any of their post-1948 films to the networks. Until 
then, they saw television as a rival. After 1961, they saw it as a cash cow. 
</P>
<P>
Once the dam was broken, movies were so popular that television did what 
television always does and beat a good thing to death. At one point, each 
network had three movie nights. At nine movies a week, the networks were using 
them faster than they could be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
Even terrible films sold for ridiculous fees. The low end of the scale was 
$800,000 for two plays. At the high end, ABC paid $2 million for two showings 
of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and NBC paid $5 million for one airing of 
"Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
The networks were using movies faster than they could get them and what they 
could get cost too much money anyway, so they decided to make their own. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was first to go to multiple television movies in the 1966-67 season with 
eight of them under the "World Premiere" title, including "Fame Is the Name of 
the Game," with Tony Franciosa, Jill St. John and Susan St. James, which later 
became the series "The Name of the Game." In the same inventory was "The 
Doomsday Flight," a Rod Serling story with Jack Lord; "Dragnet '66," with Jack 
Webb back as Sgt. Joe Friday; and "Winchester '73," a remake of a 1950 Jimmy 
Stewart Western. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1969 that the networks came up with the 
television-movie-of-the-week strategy, with ABC first to try it.

SKY-SAILING;

<P>
PAIR OF BALLOON MAKERS OFFER SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A calm delight which is inexpressible and which no other situation on earth 
could give." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Balloon pilot Vincenzo Lunardi, 1784 
</P>
<P>
While others in Orange County are developing some of the world's most 
sophisticated high-tech aerospace equipment, Carl Gage and Lyle Piccard of 
Costa Mesa are building flying machines based on technology developed more than 
100 years before the Wright Brothers flew the first airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"The (hot air) balloon is sophisticated in its simplicity and it really hasn't 
changed that much over the years. It is an extremely efficient technological 
design. It can lift two or three times its own weight and can climb faster than 
many airplanes," said Gage, a former Marine Corps corporal. 
</P>
<P>
"Planes are nice if you want to get there fast. But if you really want to look 
at the world, fly a balloon." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is too heavily populated for balloon flights, but nearby 
boatyards are convenient for construction, since the balloons are made of the 
same nylon fabric used to make spinnakers for sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
"Ballooning is in many ways closer to sailing than to flying," Gage said. "I 
like to call it sky-sailing." 
</P>
<P>
Gage and Piccard operate AIR, which stands for Aeronaut Instruction &amp; 
Research, the only commercial balloon manufacturer on the West Coast and one of 
only six in the nation. They make seven to 12 balloons a year at $15,000 to 
$30,000 each, depending on the design. 
</P>
<P>
Although AIR builds mostly hot air balloons, it was recently awarded a contract 
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to build a series of helium 
balloons for meteorological experiments conducted by JPL and the University of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon structure consists of a network of supporting canvas tapes and 
cables that extend down and connect to a basket. The support network can be 
built vertically, horizontally or both -- allowing the designer flexibility and 
creativity in shaping the balloon envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful fabric panels are sewn between the web of support tapes on the shop's 
six sewing machines. One of AIR's more unusual designs was a tomato-shaped 
balloon created for a pizza parlor chain in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon gondola is made of wicker and rattan, the same materials used in 
the first balloons more than 200 years ago. "You need something strong enough 
to carry passengers, but with enough give and flexibility not to injure them in 
a rough landing," Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
Rattan is used for the larger portions of the basket and wicker for the small 
spaces in between. The reeds are soaked in a tub behind the shop and hand-woven 
around a frame with a metal bottom that serves as a platform for passengers. 
Portions of the basket are reinforced and padded with suede. Removable tanks of 
liquid propane gas are fitted inside the basket and hooked up to a detachable 
stainless steel burner, used to heat the air inside the balloon. 
</P>
<P>
Working together, Gage and Piccard can build a balloon in a month, but the work 
can be completed in just over a week with a few extra helpers at the sewing 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
"You are working with over 1,000 yards of fabric, and even though you have 
traced the patterns onto paper and cut the fabric panels around them and sewn 
it all up, you still don't know exactly what you have until you blow it up, and 
by then it's five stories tall," Piccard said. "My mother taught me to sew them 
and fly them." 
</P>
<P>
Piccard's mother, Willie, held American balloon-flying records in the 1970s. 
His stepfather, Don Piccard, built balloons out of a sailboat loft in Newport 
Beach for almost 30 years and is credited with developing hot air ballooning as 
a sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Piccard is the son of scientists Jean and Jeannete Piccard, who were among the 
first to conduct manned balloon flights into the stratosphere in the 1930s. The 
experiments delivered information about cosmic rays and the effects of 
high-altitude flight. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon-making business keeps Gage and Piccard busy but not rich; both work 
nearly full time in other occupations. Piccard is an industrial designer and 
Gage works three days a week as an engineer at Channel 22's transmitter 
facility on Mt. Wilson near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Both are certified balloon-flying instructors and offer rides on weekends in 
Temecula, Palm Springs, Paso Robles and Perris Valley. Gage even offers 
instruction in flying airships like the Goodyear blimp. He designs and sells 
commemorative pins, which he enthusiastically hands out to his passengers and 
ground crew. 
</P>
<P>
The pins, along with customary champagne toasts at the end of balloon rides, 
are not a new gimmick. They are a carry-over from the days when the first 
balloonists met up with hostile peasants in the countryside when forced to make 
emergency landings. 
</P>
<P>
"The country people were frightened of the balloons and attacked them with 
pitchforks. The balloonists calmed them down with champagne and trinkets," Gage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage's involvement in ballooning has shaped his life in the mold of early 
barnstormer pilots and balloonists who flew from town to town, landing in farm 
fields and offering rides to those who gathered around. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his weekends are similar to one recently spent in Paso Robles, where he 
offers balloon rides at Paso de Robles Winery. 
</P>
<P>
Gage was trying to get a few extra hours of sleep in quarters set up for him at 
the winery while his ground crew and passengers, mostly residents of nearby 
farms, began to gather outside at 4:30 a.m. Gage had pulled over en route from 
Costa Mesa to Paso Robles earlier in the evening and spent part of the night 
sleeping in another mobile portion of his balloon business -- a converted bread 
truck and small trailer so whimsically painted they resemble a gypsy-wagon 
caravan. 
</P>
<P>
Gage soon appeared in his pilot's jumpsuit and favorite cap, and started the 
hourlong task of inflating the balloon with a huge fan. Just after sunup, 
Gage's multicolored balloon towered overhead, and a small group was assembled 
for the first flight. In the distance, about 20 other balloons rose slowly into 
the air, like bubbles in a glass of flat champagne -- all participants in a 
balloon race at nearby Paso Robles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
As Gage's balloon floated over hillsides and pastureland, five people he hardly 
knew were tracking him on land in the former bread truck. The raucous ground 
crew tossed aside Gage's dry cleaning to find seats in the truck, drank coffee 
and blasted his favorite opera tape -- Verdi's "Rigoletto," while the driver 
made a trial-and-error effort to find roads parallel to Gage's course in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he chose me. I must look responsible," the driver joked. 
"Last time he strapped this big walkie-talkie to my chest and told me to say, 
'Ground to balloon commander, come in, come in!' and here I am driving around 
in this bread truck or whatever it is. We must look pretty funny or very 
suspicious. Like some kind of deliberately absurd Drug Enforcement Agency 
undercover operation." 
</P>
<P>
The wind picked up and Gage was forced to land in a pasture, or risk blowing 
off into areas where the ground crew could not reach the stranded balloon. The 
spectacle attracted a small crowd, residents of nearby homes out for an early 
morning walk. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the most amazing things I've ever done in my life," said Bill 
Alberts, a World War II pilot and one of those on the flight. "It's so quiet up 
there!" 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed but cheerful group of hopeful passengers was later told there 
would not be another flight because the wind was still too strong. The balloon 
was deflated and packed into the small trailer, and the crew, passengers and 
pilot headed back to the winery for a champagne brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning has clearly affected Gage's philosophy of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain kind of person to do this. You can't be obsessed with 
preconceived destinations. Ballooning trains an individual to adapt to the air 
and not overpower it. It appeals to a more imaginative and creative type who 
wants more than common routine. No two flights are ever the same."

JOSEPH N. BELL: FANNING THE FLAMES OF BIGOTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A friend invited me to accompany him to the Bren Events Center at UCI last week 
to hear a speaker named Russ Limbaugh, whose rapid rise to celebrity status in 
Southern California has piqued my friend's curiosity. As a result of that 
evening, I have a great deal more sympathy for the students at Cal State 
Fullerton who raised hell about the paid appearance on campus last Tuesday of 
Morton Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
If -- like me -- you don't listen to talk radio shows, you are probably no more 
familiar with Russ Limbaugh than I was before I heard him speak. But, as he 
modestly pointed out during the 1 1/2 hours he held forth on the platform, he 
has the largest audience of any talk show in the United States. If that's true 
-- and I have no reason to doubt it -- then God help us all. 
</P>
<P>
I had visited the Bren Center some weeks earlier to listen to a debate between 
Phyllis Schlafley and Sarah Weddington (the attorney who argued Roe vs. Wade 
before the Supreme Court), and the size of the audience was disappointing. The 
orchestra wasn't full, and there were only a scattering of people in the 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday was very different. The obvious conclusion would seem to be that 
even on college campuses, people much prefer to hear their biases supported 
than to listen to both sides of a question. The center was packed for Limbaugh, 
and there was such a horrendous traffic jam on campus that the show -- and I 
use that word advisedly -- started a half-hour late so people could reach their 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh described in graphic detail how Barney Frank -- the Massachusetts 
congressman who has acknowledged his homosexuality -- solicited and related to 
the male prostitute who once lived with him. Then Limbaugh asked his audience 
if any of them were carrying condoms. A number of young men and women 
approached the platform with condoms that Limbaugh opened and stretched over 
the microphone until they broke. He then delivered the moral of this exercise: 
that condoms won't prevent AIDS; only abstinence will. 
</P>
<P>
His tagline throughout the evening was, "I didn't make this up" -- even though 
he dealt admiringly with the probity of the Reagan Administration, which had 
the highest incidence of corruption in U.S. history. But mostly Limbaugh was 
obsessed with homosexuality; he must have spent at least a third of the evening 
railing on this subject. He invited questions from the audience which were 
delivered to the platform while he was talking, so he read them cold. One was a 
diatribe against gays that made even Limbaugh blanch, and he put it aside, 
saying, "This is really sick." What he apparently failed to recognize was that 
much of what he was saying was sick, too, and that he was encouraging that type 
of response from his audience. 
</P>
<P>
I watched at first in awe, then consternation, and finally revulsion. Limbaugh 
works an audience as well as anyone I've ever seen -- including Billy Graham 
and Father Coughlin. He can be funny -- and was occasionally. His joke about 
John-John Kennedy running for the vice presidency and being told in a debate, 
"Mr. Kennedy, you're no Dan Quayle," was funny. But mostly he was cruel. 
</P>
<P>
His technique was pie-in-the-face and knee-to-the-groin. And his audience -- 
about evenly divided between student types and well-dressed middle-aged people 
-- ate it up. He was telling them that it was not only OK but downright 
hilarious to be bigoted and selfish and hard-nosed and self-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
A social conscience is for the weak and sappy and ineffective in our midst. 
</P>
<P>
I left the Bren Center with a lot of mixed feelings -- and a fair amount of 
liberal guilt. Was I as culpable as they in only wanting to hear things that 
supported my own biases? I pondered speakers I'd heard and liked who offered a 
different point of view. I could think of only two: Mark Russell and Mort Sahl. 
</P>
<P>
There are fundamental differences between their techniques and Limbaugh's. Both 
of them stick it to all points of the political spectrum (Sahl has become 
almost conservative). Both of them are subtle and seldom pick on people who 
can't defend themselves. Neither of them is cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there should be no boundaries for satire, but I don't find jokes about 
the homeless very funny. Nor do cheap shots amuse me. Satire should be directed 
at the strong, not the weak. At the exploiters, not the exploited. At the 
bullies, not the victims. 
</P>
<P>
All of us fight a constant battle to put down the unattractive facets of our 
humanity -- the greed and fear and selfishness and deception and 
self-indulgence. Advertisers have learned that they can sell products by 
appealing -- sometimes not very subtly -- to these qualities. And ambitious 
people have discovered that they can get ahead in the world -- in politics, 
entertainment, business -- by doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Limbaugh does that very well. He may not yet be in Morton Downey Jr.'s 
class as a right-wing provocateur, but he's getting there. Maybe his liberal 
associates at KFI use the same tactics from the opposite political point of 
view. I don't know. I just know that fanning the flames of bigotry -- from 
whatever political direction -- is something Orange County doesn't need right 
now. We've managed enough of it on our own. We don't need help.

THE CASE OF THE MURDERED PATRIARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only the night light illuminated David Werner when his daughter discovered him, 
a foot-long kitchen knife plunged in his neck, a pool of blood beneath his 
deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ann Werner would tell police that she came home that April night to 
find their Mission Viejo townhouse helter-skelter -- a toppled chair blocking 
the front door, lamps knocked down, the kitchen table upturned. 
</P>
<P>
But even murder has a certain sensibility to it, and what Orange County 
Sheriff's Department homicide detectives were seeing didn't add up. 
</P>
<P>
This appeared to be a violent burglary, yet nothing was stolen. Why did every 
room look like someone had struggled in it when the 72-year-old Werner clearly 
never left his bed? There was no sign of break-in, so how did the killer enter? 
</P>
<P>
Then came the alibis, which unraveled like a cheap sweater. People weren't 
where they said they were. And in less than a week after the April 15 slaying, 
Werner's attorney said, two suspects admitted their involvement. One was the 
accused killer. 
</P>
<P>
A case for Columbo this was not. 
</P>
<P>
In all, four people have been charged in what prosecutors say was a plot to 
kill Werner for his money -- an estate estimated by authorities at "several 
hundred thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Sewn together from court records and interviews with attorneys and others, a 
story unfolds with a cast of characters who have little in common except 
unhappy childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
* Deborah Ann Werner, a 40-year-old liquor store clerk whose former boss 
remembered her calling the victim "daddy," is accused of master-minding her 
father's killing. Werner and her two brothers, neither of whom are suspects, 
are the beneficiaries of his estate. She has steadfastly denied any role in the 
murder plot. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles L. Clemmons, a 20-year-old Anaheim construction worker, is charged 
with smothering and stabbing Werner to make sure he was dead. Clemmons, who 
grew up in Los Angeles on welfare and bounced from job to job, allegedly 
received a $3,000 check from Deborah Werner after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
* Carrie Mae Chidester, a 21-year-old telemarketer from Garden Grove and 
Clemmons' former girlfriend, is also charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
* Cynthia Diebolt, 20, Deborah Werner's daughter, was charged with solicitation 
for murder after she allegedly tried unsuccessfully to get two other men to 
kill her grandfather on behalf of her mother. Now expecting her second child, 
Diebolt is the only suspect not in jail. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear exactly what defense each suspect will offer as the trial 
unfolds. The three murder defendants are being tried together and have a 
preliminary hearing scheduled on Monday in South Orange County Municipal Court 
in Laguna Niguel. Diebolt will be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
But Werner has been seen by a psychiatrist "in order to help prepare her 
defense through psychological testing and interviews," her attorney, Jack M. 
Earley, wrote in a court document. 
</P>
<P>
And Earley and other attorneys involved in the case suggest that Werner's 
defense may include tales of a daughter pushed to her limit in trying to care 
for an aging and alcoholic father who could be incredibly demanding, especially 
when he drank. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said one attorney involved in the case, "is really the sorriest, most 
pathetic cast of characters you will ever see. If you didn't know they were 
accused of murder, you'd feel sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
For, ultimately, killing the Werner patriarch for his money appeared to be 
utterly unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Now fierce enemies who are kept apart during trips from jail to court, the 
suspects met through a series of intertwining relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Clemmons met Carrie Chidester at a bar. Diebolt was a friend of 
Chidester, who also worked at one time with Deborah Werner, a bookkeeper who 
also had done stints as a department store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and Diebolt, the mother and daughter, had seen each other no more than 
half a dozen times in the 19 years since Werner and Cynthia's father had 
divorced. But more than a year ago, the relationship was rekindled when Cynthia 
Diebolt called her mother before giving birth to her first child, Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
The plot was first hatched last March, when Diebolt allegedly asked two men, 
who had been arrested with her earlier this year during a Westminster 
methamphetamine raid, to kill her grandfather, according to records filed by 
the Sheriff's Department in West Orange County Municipal Court in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
She told them her grandfather was "worth some cash" and had a life insurance 
policy from which her mother would pay them for the murder, according to the 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
The men, both of whom were awaiting trial on the drug charges, declined the 
offer, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Clemmons was unemployed and spending a lot of time at a 
Garden Grove dance club called Faces, according to his lawyer, Donald G. 
Rubright. It was here that he met Chidester and they began dating. 
</P>
<P>
Where Diebolt had failed, two sources close to the case said, her friend 
Chidester would succeed: she allegedly found Werner's hired gun. 
</P>
<P>
Court records, Sheriff's Department statements and interviews with sources 
close to the case provided the following account of the hours before and after 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
David Werner, sometimes bedridden and cared for by his only daughter, Deborah, 
lay sleeping in his pajamas, having nodded off early for a Saturday night. 
Deborah Werner and her father had long been estranged, partly because her 
father did not like her husband. But after she got a divorce, the 
father-daughter relationship seemed to improve, friends said, and Deborah moved 
in to help her father, whose health was declining. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Werner left the sliding glass doors unlocked at the El Moro Drive 
townhouse, then went outside. Clemmons entered, Werner was smothered with his 
pillow, then stabbed in the neck to ensure his death, said Lt. Richard J. 
Olson, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects attracted no attention in the quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night -- and apparently before police were summoned -- Chidester, 
Clemmons and Werner gathered at a nearby 7-Eleven store, and a $3,000 check was 
given as payment for the killing, Olson said. (An additional $1,000 was 
promised but never delivered, he added.) 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear exactly where Chidester and Werner were during the slaying, but 
Chidester's attorney indicated that she was in the vicinity. "Once she realized 
it was really going to happen," said lawyer Gary Pohlson, "she tried to talk 
them out of it, and wanted Deborah Werner to drive her back home." 
</P>
<P>
Werner returned to the home and called police about 1 a.m. Sunday. When they 
arrived at 1:17, she told them that her father was retiring for the evening 
when she left the home about 9 p.m. Saturday to pick up her friend, Chidester, 
in Huntington Beach. They returned to find the home ransacked, according to 
police reports. 
</P>
<P>
But Chidester was not there when officers arrived. After she found the body, 
Werner told them, Chidester grabbed her and helped her into the living room. 
Then, Chidester "left to get something to drink" at a nearby convenience store 
"while she (Werner) called to get help," Deputy Ray Cunningham wrote in his 
report of that interview. 
</P>
<P>
Chidester did not return for nearly an hour. 
</P>
<P>
By the following Saturday, after numerous interviews and alibi checks, first 
Clemmons, then Chidester, then Werner were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth suspect was also arrested that day. But Bernadette Cemore, the deputy 
district attorney prosecuting the case, said she lacked enough evidence to 
charge him and he was released. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, Diebolt was arrested on a warrant charging her with the 
earlier solicitations for murder. Now pregnant with her second child, Diebolt 
was released from jail on $35,000 bail secured by her father's Westminster 
townhouse, where she must stay by court order. 
</P>
<P>
The other three defendants are being held without bail at e Orange County Jail 
as they await their preliminary hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not disclosed what, if any, physical evidence they have that 
might implicate the suspects. They have said inconsistencies in statements by 
the defendants led to their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that the prosecution and defense attorneys say they agree on: 
Werner's killing was more than a simple case of greed. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who looks at it," said Earley, Werner's lawyer, "is going to have to 
look at family dynamics." 
</P>
<P>
None of the defendants had what could be considered stable childhoods. In fact, 
they were all either adopted or abandoned, at some point, by their birth 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
According to information given to his lawyer, Rubright, Clemmons never knew his 
father; his mother would disappear for days, and at one point the state took 
custody of him and placed him in a succession of foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
Chidester was given up by her birth mother, although Pohlson, her lawyer, 
declined to discuss that, saying her adoptive parents have stood by her since 
the arrest. Pohlson did say that his client had a weight problem and that her 
desperate need to be liked contributed to her unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Carrie wanted out of the whole thing, but she doesn't assert herself. She 
doesn't want people to dislike her, so she kept going along, hoping everyone 
would like her," Pohlson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that's no excuse for murder, to get involved," he added. But 
Chidester "never believed she was going to be involved in a murder. . . . She 
probably deluded herself that this was (not) going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Because three generations are involved, the Werner family saga is perhaps the 
most painfully striking. 
</P>
<P>
David Werner, born in Montana to Russian immigrant parents, had two sons with 
his late wife, Vera Mae, before they adopted an infant daughter they named 
Deborah. 
</P>
<P>
Werner declined to be interviewed, and her lawyer declined to detail much of 
the woman's past, which he said he did not know. His client told him that she 
had run away from home throughout her childhood, which was unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father was an alcoholic, and always was," Earley said. "Her mother had 
some problems with alcoholism, too. That's what I'm getting from Debbie." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Diebolt and her father, Jerome Diebolt, offered what they knew of 
Werner and her family through their attorney, Larry Bruce. Jerome Diebolt, who 
was once married to Deborah Werner, has known the family for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to their account, Werner told the Diebolts that she had been adopted 
but did not seem traumatized by that, Bruce said. She was close to her mother, 
removed from her father. "He was really more of a figurehead-type of father," 
Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Diebolt and Deborah Werner married May 4, 1968. Her parents refused to 
attend because Diebolt was Catholic; she was Jewish. Her only relative at the 
wedding was her brother, Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah's parents only came around five months after the wedding, when they 
learned that their daughter was pregnant. Fourteen months after Cynthia was 
born, Deborah wanted a divorce. When she got one, she took her daughter to live 
with Dave and Vera Mae Werner. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks later," Bruce said, turning away from the phone to double check with 
the Diebolts, "the grandfather calls (Jerome) and says, 'You better come get 
Cynthia. Deborah's gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia saw her mother rarely. By the time she was 15, she was getting in 
trouble. She barely attended Bolsa Grande High School in Garden Grove and then 
transferred to Lake Continuation School in Westminster, where she lasted six 
days. She was then reported as a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia evidently kept in touch with her grandparents, spending family weekends 
with them in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Diebolt said Dave Werner was concerned that any contact at this late 
stage between Deborah and Cynthia would cause more harm than good to his 
granddaughter, who was having drug and truancy problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt that it was genetic, that Deborah had passed on her problems to 
Cynthia," Bruce said of the elder Werner. Mother and daughter were both 
abandoned by their mothers, ran away from home, got into trouble with the law, 
and were jailed and became mothers before they were 20. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the neighbors in Werner's Mission Viejo neighborhood said the patriarch 
seemed like a nice man who kept to himself. Others who knew him at a gymnasium 
in Orange described him similarly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Rubinstein, who lived across the street from Dave Werner and 
was also Deborah's former boss, said there had been some bad blood between 
father and daughter before she moved into his Mission Viejo home during his 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said Deborah Werner had been taken out of her father's will until 
she moved in with him, less than a year before his murder. 
</P>
<P>
"She called him daddy and was all sweetness," Rubinstein recalled, "but she did 
not like him. She complained about him all the time. She wasn't getting any 
money from him; she complained of having to support him." 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said Dave Werner drank heavily, getting out "his bottle of vodka at 
about 4:30 and packing it in for bed by 7:30 or 8. He was arrogant, too. A 
know-it-all." 
</P>
<P>
Though he said his client has denied any role in her father's murder, Earley 
admits that their relationship was unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
David Werner, a retired stockbroker, was an ailing elderly man who could be 
"difficult to live with, especially when he drank." He was a controlling father 
who so dominated Deborah's life that he dictated his daughter's visitors to 
their home and forbade her pursuing a relationship with her 20-year-old 
daughter, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said the elder Werner's "infirmaries" forced his daughter to play 
nursemaid to a man who became "difficult" because he could not accept the 
limits of physical frailties such as heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The only historian is Deborah because I don't think we're necessarily going to 
have cooperation from the rest of the Werner family. . . . Their perceptions of 
history are now going to be colored (with) her as the enemy," Earley said, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
"But if you have the 'Father Knows Best' father and the perfect daughter, 
you're not going to be in this position in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
"What you find in these cases is (that) a lot of people involved lose 
perspective with the problem," Earley continued. "Family problems are like a 
sore tooth, and you are inclined with a toothache to want to take a pair of 
pliers and rip it out. But that's not the best way." 
</P>
<P>
Before David Werner was cremated and his ashes scattered along the Long Beach 
shoreline, an autopsy was performed that provided an ironic footnote to his 
murder. He was a man dying of arteriosclerosis -- hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a miracle," one attorney said, "if he'd lived through the 
end of the year."

ANN CONWAY: TOP CHEFS CREATE CULINARY DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When chef Jean-Pierre Vigato promises a "grand" chocolate dessert he means an 
outrageous chocolate dessert. The culinary finale at the premiere of the "Great 
Chefs" series at the Robert Mondavi Wine and Food Center was worth throwing 
away the calorie counter for. Up for tasting: chocolate mousse, chocolate 
sorbet and chocolate cake done three ways (one of them being a light-as-a-cloud 
bitter cake presented in a swirling pool of coffee-laced creme anglaise). 
</P>
<P>
Such was the sweet life on Tuesday night for about 60 guests of charming 
vintner Robert Mondavi and his wife, Margrit Biever. The new Costa Mesa center 
promises to regularly showcase international chefs like Vigato, who flew from 
Paris to whip up culinary delights such as duck foie gras flavored with vanilla 
and ginger, steamed turbot served on a bed of spinach greens and a breast of 
squab that had been soaked in cream (to make it perfectly tender, but of 
course). 
</P>
<P>
Guests included Pierro Selvaggio, owner of Valentino's restaurant in Los 
Angeles; Mauro Vincente, owner of Ristorante Rex in Los Angeles; Anton 
Segerstrom; Toren Segerstrom, and Thomas Gurtner, general manager of the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sensational touches: tables gleaming with sterling flatware, a phenomenon 
unseen in localpublic dining circles; sculpted tulips arranged inside crystal 
bubble bowls (created by the Mondavis' Napa Valley florist, Michael Rayner), 
and classical French music played on piano and flute. 
</P>
<P>
Underwriters dinner: How do you honor the folks who enable galas to make 
mega-bucks? If you're the Hoag 552 Club, a support group for Hoag Hospital of 
Newport Beach, you ply them with fine wine and Michael Kang's cuisine and send 
them into the night with a ribbon-adorned box of mouth-watering truffles. 
</P>
<P>
That's how it went on Monday for the underwriters of the 552 Club's annual 
Christmas Carol Ball, the Dec. 2 event that is expected to bring a whopping 
$90,000 to Hoag Hospital's coffers. Underwriters gathered at Five Feet Too 
restaurant at Newport Center Fashion Island, tipped tulips of Chardonnay and 
then sat down at place settings accented with orchid petals to dine on roasted 
monkfish salad, veal chop with ginger apricot sauce and checkerboard chocolate 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag 552 Club president Bill Pierpoint estimated ball costs will be $50,000. 
And, because the underwriters have already come up with $62,000, all proceeds 
from the $552-per-couple event will be gravy. Pierpoint announced that the 
club's goal to raise $1 million for the Patty and George Hoag Cancer Center had 
recently been realized. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dale is ball chairman. Ball underwriters include Donna and John Crean, 
Kellina and Michael Hayde, Richard and Sandy Sewell and Newport Harbor 
Radiology Associates. 
</P>
<P>
How sweet it was: They turned the tables at "Soiree by the Bay," the party on 
Saturday night staged by Founders Plus, a support group of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. Instead of smothering the dining room table with hors 
d'oeuvres during the cocktail reception, Turnip Rose caterers dazzled guests 
with a luscious display of desserts. For starters: Black Forest tart, pear 
tart, hazelnut tart, a strawberry wheel and a lemon cake so neon-yellow it had 
honorary co-chairmen Henry and Renee Segerstrom doing double takes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the party held at the bay-front home of Martha and Dr. Hansel 
Benvenuti turned out to be three parties. Some guests enjoyed the landscaped 
walkway of the Harbor Island manse so much they remained there to dine on 
passed appetizers and sip their champagne floating with raspberries. Then there 
were the early birds who had managed to float all the way through the house; 
they spent most of the night living it up in a tent, bayside. Another group 
gathered in the living room by a crackling fire where a jazz trio granted song 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the soiree, estimated at $16,350, was underwritten entirely by 
Founders Plus members and friends. Proceeds of $23,000 will go into Founders 
Plus programs, which include distribution of unused and reduced theater tickets 
to arts lovers who cannot afford to pay the full price. 
</P>
<P>
Vesta Curry is president of the group. Chairing the event were Nora Jorgenson 
and Shari Esayian. On the committee: Charles Margolin, Joe and Ethel Hunt, Jean 
Hamann, Sandy and Chuck McCune, Ann Pange, Robert Roberts, Cecil and Catherine 
Wright, Barbara Johannes, Maxine Gibson and Jan Landstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion feasting: Talk about a feast for the eyes. Per Spook, the avant-garde 
couturier who holes up on tres chic Avenue George V in Paris, brought his 
neoclassic ensembles to Le Meridien in Newport Beach on Saturday night to 
benefit the newly formed Monarch Beach League of the Orange County chapter of 
the American Diabetes Assn. After a dinner that featured sesame crab cakes,

A Costa Mesa man who tried to come to the aid of a woman was in serious 
condition at a hospital today after being shot in front of a Santa Ana 
convenience store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Aranda, 30, was shot by a man who pulled a pistol as the two were 
fighting, Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said. The fight erupted about 9:50 
p.m. Wednesday when Aranda tried to intercede on behalf of a woman who was 
being harassed by the man in front of the Circle K convenience store at 
McFadden Avenue and Flower Street. 
</P>
<P>
Aranda was subduing the man when he suddenly pulled a gun and started shooting. 
Aranda was hit twice in the groin and buttocks but managed to flee across the 
street, where he hid behind a parked car, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
The short, stocky gunman fled before police and paramedics arrived. United 
Western Medical Center in Santa Ana reported that Aranda's condition improved 
overnight from critical to serious.

HOUSE GIVES ITSELF A RAISE; 
</P>
<P>
YEARLY PAY WOULD GO TO $120,000

House members today voted to raise their pay more than $30,000 a year over the 
next 13 months while overhauling ethics rules in a move one congressman called 
a "game -- we come with ethics reform and we sneak in a pay raise." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed 252 to 174, just 10 months after intense public criticism 
forced the House to reject a larger pay increase. The measure would increase 
members' pay from the current $89,500 a year to more than $120,000 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Comparable increases would go to top-level executive branch employees and to 
federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal sped through the House with strong support from the leaders of 
both parties and an endorsement from President Bush. A slight majority of 
Republicans voting opposed the bill despite Bush's stance. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to consider it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand and sympathize with people in my district who make $15- and 
$20- and $30,000 a year who would have trouble understanding why this kind of 
pay level is needed," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
"But," he told his colleagues, "in your heart and in your mind you know it's 
the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. James A. Traficant (D-Ohio) took a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the game -- we come with ethics reform and we sneak in a pay 
raise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traficant said members of Congress should have a pay increase, but not until 
they deal with serious economic problems confronting the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.) expressed the feeling of most members, 
saying: "This is a very difficult vote -- one of the most difficult votes we 
will ever face. But a yes vote is the right vote. A pay raise is justified. 
There is a definite need to reduce stress -- the financial stress -- both on 
members and throughout the federal system. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the situation improves . . . this Congress is ultimately in danger of 
becoming a body comprised almost exclusively of Mother Teresas, Donald Trumps, 
Ralph Naders and idle rich kids. We cannot allow this to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), co-chairman of the task force that drafted the bill, 
said the new ethics code "removes the stigma that this House, this noble body, 
can be misused by outside interests," and should "restore faith between those 
those who govern and those who are governed." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics reforms in the bill stem in part from the case of former Speaker Jim 
Wright (D-Tex.), who resigned from the House in June after the House Ethics 
Committee charged him with evading limits on honorarium income and with 
accepting improper gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The package would prohibit House members from accepting speaking fees and other 
honorariums, and limit all sources of outside income to 15% of their 
congressional pay. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate and House have paid their members different salaries in the past. In 
1982, the House accepted a 15% increase, which the Senate rejected and allowed 
unlimited honorariums. A year later, the Senate took the pay raise and set a 
cap on speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics rules approved today apply only to the House. The Senate will vote 
on its own version of the new rules.

SCIENTISTS WILL RELEASE WASPS TO COMBAT ASH WHITEFLY INVASION

<TEXT>
<P>
Biologists hoping to eradicate the pesky ash whitefly, a tiny insect which has 
defoliated trees from Sacramento to San Diego, were preparing today for the 
release Friday of 50 wasps that help control the pest. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny, stingless wasps will be released at the Balboa Sports Center, a 
fly-infested park in Encino, by scientists from University of California, 
Riverside. The black-and-gold wasps, which rapidly reproduce, were imported 
from Israel and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp is a parasitic insect which reproduces by laying its eggs in the 
bodies of the ash whitefly. Scientists hope to release 250 more wasps 
throughout Southern California later this month. The first whiteflies were 
spotted in California at a Van Nuys fruit stand in August, 1988.

KOHL CRITICIZES OPPONENTS OF REUNIFICATION

Chancellor Helmut Kohl today criticized people who say there is little chance 
the two Germanys will reunite, an apparent response to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
comments on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"He who does not want to make decisions for our people should not try to 
persuade them the best thing is a division of our fatherland," Kohl said in his 
first speech to Parliament regarding East Germany's historic border openings. 
</P>
<P>
Reunification has become an increasingly important topic following the growing 
unrest in Communist East Germany that led to the new government of President 
Egon Krenz and the decision to open the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president on Wednesday said talk about reunification "would mean 
interference in the affairs" of East Germany and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But Kohl, who did not mention Gorbachev, said East Germans "must be able to 
decide for themselves, which path they want to follow in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said West Germany would "respect every decision made by the people of the 
German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in free self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor claimed socialism is a "total failure." A day earlier, Gorbachev 
insisted the Communist revolution "was not a mistake."

Masses of Americans snuffed out cigarettes, cigars and pipes today to take part 
in the 13th Great American Smokeout -- a mammoth public health effort aimed at 
saving smokers from an early grave. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the 24-hour smoking moratorium is a 
warning to men, women and children about the nation's leading cause of 
preventable death. The annual smoking death count totals 390,000 -- or an 
average 1,000 funerals a day -- from cancer, heart disease and lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, which depends on a $900-million tobacco crop, the society 
distributed a record amount of educational material promoting the smokeout.

THREE SAFE IN BEIRUT KIDNAP SCARE;

HOSTAGES: STORY COMES AS A SURPRISE TO AMERICAN AND TWO GERMANS, WHO SAY THEY

After a kidnaping scare based on messages from the Lebanese underworld, a San 
Francisco woman and two West Germans turned up safe today, telling diplomats 
they had been held up by robbers but had not been taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Goettelmann, West German ambassador to Lebanon, said Deborah Fahrend, 
54; Munir Sami, 39, and his 7-year-old son Daniel were never kidnaped as 
claimed by the otherwise unknown Just Revenge Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Munir Sami is a Lebanese-born West German citizen. Fahrend had recently been 
living in West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The three foreigners first heard of their alleged abduction when they read 
today's newspapers, the ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were astonished when they read the story. They came to the embassy to see 
what was happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fahrend's 89-year-old mother, Margaret Brooks of Davis, Calif., 
the American woman went to Lebanon last month to do research for a book and she 
has a publisher lined up. Her only previous published works -- including poetry 
-- had been printed by herself, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to her mother last week, Fahrend wrote she was going to Beirut with 
Munir Sami. "I'm going to use Munir's connections to the hilt," referring to 
diplomatic friends he has in Lebanon. "It seems to me to be a chance in a 
lifetime," Fahrend added. 
</P>
<P>
"She tackles life pretty much head-on, but she would be unaware of danger in 
thinking of going to Lebanon," Fahrend's sister, Emily Rowe, said in Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"She's creative and wants to do something, and she's still searching for her 
fulfillment, and that's why she's doing the writing." 
</P>
<P>
Sami's sister, Marwa, said the three were seized by gunmen who held them for 
about 24 hours and took all their money. The three were then set free. 
</P>
<P>
Most Western news agencies in West Beirut ignored as probable hoaxes telephone 
calls Tuesday claiming the three were hostages. A later message, accompanied by 
copies of their evidently stolen passports, was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sami's mother said the three were expected to leave by boat from the 
Christian-held port of Jounieh, north of Beirut, and fly from Cyprus to West 
Germany later today.

S. AFRICANS OPEN BEACHES TO ALL RACES; 
</P>

APARTHEID: PRESIDENT FREDERIK W. DE KLERK PROMISES THAT OTHER RECREATIONAL 
FACILITIES WILL SOON BE DESEGREGATED.

<P>
The beaches of South Africa were thrown open to all races today, in time for 
blacks to enjoy the summer holiday in areas where they could not go under 
apartheid laws. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk also said he will soon desegregate other 
recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, segregation on the beaches has been gradually 
lifted, but two beaches in Cape Town, five in Durban and many in other resorts 
remained reserved for South Africa's white minority. 
</P>
<P>
"All beaches will henceforth be accessible to all members of the public," De 
Klerk told the advisory President's Council in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said he will repeal the Separate Amenities Act, a key apartheid 
law that regulates access to facilities such as parks, libraries and town 
halls, after talks with community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has arrived to repeal this act. The government has decided to do so 
as soon as possible," said De Klerk, announcing the latest in a series of 
reforms since he replaced Pieter W. Botha in August. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he will announce further reforms at the opening of Parliament in 
February, but he gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
White supremacists fumed over today's move while anti-apartheid leaders gave it 
guarded approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I am upset. This will not be tolerated. We will all have to take the necessary 
steps to stop this," said Rozier de Ville, a parliamentarian of the white 
pro-apartheid Conservative Party. He declined to say what those steps might be. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best news I have had for a long time. . . . We can look forward to 
a peaceful Christmas," said anti-apartheid campaigner Margaret Ambler. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said the abolition of the Separate Amenities Act would make it 
impossible for town councils controlled by the far-right Conservative Party to 
bar blacks from public places as they do now. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do not see why we cannot mix with our own kind if we so wish," said 
Fraser Gordon, a right-wing city councilman in the Indian Ocean holiday resort 
of Durban. 
</P>
<P>
Dissident leaders said the reforms were welcome but long overdue.

Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is banning all business related to South Africa, 
including trading or researching South African securities, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The move by the country's biggest brokerage goes further than similar policies 
of other securities firms and could encourage others to take a tougher stance 
to protest South Africa's practices of racial separation, the Wall Street 
Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's move, announced in an internal memorandum to employees, 
reflects a growing public outcry that Wall Street firms continue to maintain 
ties to South Africa, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
But some other financial firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton, already have 
ceased doing business with South Africa, its corporations and individuals.

MOSBACHER SEES 'MOST-FAVORED' TRADE FOR SOVIET

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said today the expected quick easing of 
Soviet emigration laws will open up the Soviet Union for most-favored-nation 
trade status with the United States within one to three months. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher commented in a television interview as the Soviet Embassy called a 
news conference to discuss "new Soviet legislation involving entry and exit 
visas for its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we're going to see them moving quickly to pass this emigration 
bill and then that will open it up for the most-favored-nation treatment, which 
will lower tariffs," Mosbacher said on NBC's "Today" show. "And it will make it 
easier for the Soviets to sell to us." 
</P>
<P>
Asked when the Soviets might get the more advantageous trade status, Mosbacher 
said: "I would guess it would be within the next one to three months." 
</P>
<P>
A draft law lifting most travel restrictions on Soviets passed its first 
legislative hurdle Monday in Moscow. The bill allows emigration for virtually 
anyone who has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
It was given preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet legislature and 
formalizes many changes that have already been put into practice in Soviet 
emigration and travel policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said "unfortunately for them," the Soviets do not have much that the 
United States wants to buy, mentioning "petroleum and vodka and caviar and not 
much else." 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets desperately need Western currency, hard currency," he said. "They 
also realize in the long term the only way they're going to get this is 
investments (by) U.S. and other companies over there. What they want is U.S. 
companies to come over, make investments."

On Oct. 26, President Bush extended most-favored-nation status to Hungary, 
making it the first country to be freed from a 1974 law denying U.S. trade 
credits to most communist nations. 
</P>
<P>
The action gives the recipient nation full access to U.S. markets and the 
lowest possible tariff rates, putting it on an equal footing with major U.S. 
trading partners.

The law requires an annual report to Congress from the President on the 
emigration policies of each nation covered under the restriction, and an 
assessment of whether there has been progress toward unrestricted emigration.

A teddy bear that jumps rope, dolls with removable parts and "Freddy Krueger" 
horror gloves topped a consumer advocate's 18th annual list of dangerous toys 
today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 third- and fourth-grade schoolchildren here joined Edward Swartz, 
a Boston trial lawyer, consumer advocate and author of the book "Toys That 
Kill," as he released his annual list. The students helped Swartz select the 
final toys from a list of 21 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Toys on the list this year and dangers cited by Swartz: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Jump Rope" Teddy Bear, for age 3 and up; comes with a nylon jump rope and a 
headband that both pose risk of strangulation injury. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Popeye" doll; a small removable pipe included with the doll poses ingestion 
and choking risk. 
</P>
<P>
3. Freddy Krueger's "razor" glove and Butcher Knife and Meat Cleaver; both 
could be used in violent manner and cause injury. 
</P>
<P>
4. X-15 Rocket Plane (Ready to Fly Model); Suggestions for adult supervision 
and warnings about power lines reveal the toy is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
5. Kid Sister; detachable hair ribbons and elastic bands can be swallowed.

DISNEY TAKING MAGIC MOVIE KINGDOM TO FRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE THEME PARK PLANNED NEAR EURO DISNEYLAND WILL COMBINE A 
FULL-SCALE PRODUCTION STUDIO WITH TOURIST RIDES.

<P>
Walt Disney Co., bolstered by the success of its movie theme park in Florida, 
announced today it will open a similar attraction in 1996 next to its planned 
Euro Disneyland park in France. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its Disney MGM Studios-Europe will include full-scale movie 
and television production. The theme park will feature re-creations of 
Hollywood and Sunset boulevards in Los Angeles and show how earthquakes, 
explosions and flash floods are filmed. 
</P>
<P>
Disney said the French theme park will resemble its Disney MGM Studios Theme 
Park at Orlando, Fla., which has been attracting capacity crowds since it 
opened in May. Disney announced plans in August to double the size of the 
$500-million attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles said the 
announcement was not a surprise because of the success of the Florida 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie theme park has succeeded beyond expectations," Logsdon said. "It's 
been packed every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Florida attraction has a capacity of 25,000, considerably smaller than the 
other Disney parks. MCA Inc. is planning to open a competing attraction, 
Universal Studios Florida, next spring in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's Florida park features a re-creation of Hollywood Boulevard of the 
1930s and 1940s and will soon include a Star Tours flight simulator ride, 
already a major draw at Disneyland in Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Disney said that the French studio theme park will be built adjacent to its 
Euro Disneyland complex of attractions and hotels near Paris, due to open in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The European studio will be able to draw not just the people in the European 
Economic Community, but also probably a lot of people from the Eastern Bloc 
countries," Logsdon said. 
</P>
<P>
The new theme park will include a Magic of Disney Animation attraction, a Dick 
Tracy Crimestoppers high-speed ride and the Muppet Movie Ride. Disney acquired 
Henson Associates Inc., which created the Muppet characters, for more than $100 
million in late August. 
</P>
<P>
Disney said the move will enhance its strategy of increasing production of live 
action and animated film entertainment in Europe for the European and world 
film markets. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the already opened television and motion picture animation 
company in France, employing 100 artists, we are excited at the prospect of 
bringing additional full-scale movie and television production to Europe while 
providing guests with the entertainment magic of a second Disney theme park," 
said Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officers have previously disclosed that they are considering building a 
similar movie theme park at Tokyo Disneyland.

NBC'S 3 ANCHORS: NOT A SIGNAL

An "NBC Nightly News" show using three anchors instead of Tom Brokaw alone was 
brought on by special circumstances and does not signal a change in the 
program's format, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw taped the start of the Wednesday night show in Washington, then had to 
leave to serve as master of ceremonies at the annual Robert F. Kennedy Human 
Rights awards, said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, in New York, filled in during the rest of the broadcast, 
with Garrick Utley, in Berlin, anchoring reports about developments in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
ABC was the first network to use a triple-anchor format on a regular evening 
newscast. From 1978 to 1983, its newscast was anchored in Washington by Frank 
Reynolds, in Chicago by Max Robinson and in London by Peter Jennings. Jennings 
has been sole anchor of "World News Tonight" since ABC's troika format was 
dropped six years ago. Reynolds and Robinson have since died.

Concerned that their industry could face government re-regulation, cable 
television executives stressed today that their industry is competitive and 
offers viewers ample choice at reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are not the bad guys. We're not out to build an empire," John 
Malone, chairman of Denver-based TeleCommunications Inc., one of the nation's 
largest cable television operators, told a Senate subcommittee on 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came during the first of two days of hearings that the 
subcommittee is holding to examine the effect of the 1984 Cable 
Telecommunications Act, which largely deregulated the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the hearings began, Sen. Jack C. Danforth (R-Mo.) introduced a 
bill to regulate the rates of local cable systems that do not face effective 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any consideration of re-regulation is premature and would have a 
negative impact on the industry," said James Robbins, president of Cox Cable 
Communications, the Atlanta cable giant.

LIZ SMITH: EATING OUT OF CARTONS -- IT'S AN ALL-TIME NO-NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"NEVER, NEVER eat anything out of a carton, even if you are at home alone with 
the shades drawn. Doing so is wicked and constitutes Miss Manners' one 
exception to the generally genial rule about violations of etiquette not 
counting if you don't get caught," writes Judith Martin. 
</P>
<P>
So now we know why the Corleone family of "The Godfather" films has had so much 
trouble in its dynasty. It all probably stems from "eating Chinese takeout" 
from cartons in that famous scene from the first movie. 
</P>
<P>
And that's nothing. Frank Sinatra's late mother used to rebuke him for drinking 
from the milk carton while standing in the cool shadow of the refrigerator. 
Dolly Sinatra knew her "Miss Manners" stuff, you see. 
</P>
<P>
THE MOST coveted role in Hollywood for any young actor is the lead in Tim 
Burton's next movie, "Edward Scissorhand," for 20th Century Fox. (It will be 
Burton's first movie since the sensational "Batman.") 
</P>
<P>
The star is to be Johnny Depp of TV's "21 Jump Street," and he'll do his acting 
during a series hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN DENNIS MET MEG -- The delightful Meg Ryan and the divine Dennis Quaid, 
those co-stars of "D.O.A." and "Innerspace," are engaged -- formally. Their 
long-playing off-screen romance seems to have reached a more serious phase. 
</P>
<P>
NOW ABOUT "Steel Magnolias." My pal Pia Lindstrom insists it's a movie that 
people will enjoy, provided they never saw the brilliant off-Broadway play by 
Robert Harling. I'm not sure. I think it's the most overwrought cinema in 
recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is half way over before it settles down enough that you can 
understand what the actors are saying. By then you have a terrible headache. 
The actors don't interact; they seem each to be doing some individual thing. I 
know Ray Stark, Herb Ross and writer Harling felt they had to "open up" the 
play, but they've sunk it under big-screen, epic entertainment values. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, however, is for the most part, fascinating. Dolly Parton rises above 
everything; she is subdued, simple, believable and simply great as the beauty 
shop owner. Shirley MacLaine is excellent once they let her quit screaming and 
dragging a big dog around as in her chaotic entrance. Olympia Dukakis is 
wonderful but seems to be in a Noel Coward drawing room comedy. Daryl Hannah 
plays well against her sexy image as the "born again" beauty operator. 
</P>
<P>
I was disappointed by the all-important relationship between the mother (Sally 
Field) and the saintly daughter (Julia Roberts.) This is crucial to the plot, 
but I felt the most they convey is the usual mother-daughter squabbling. And 
Julia is more like a spoiled brat than a girl whose sweetness touches all 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
So, I'd say go see the play, one of the best ever of its kind. Then see the 
movie, just so you'll be able to shake your head at how Tri-Star missed the 
boat by a Louisiana country mile.

Free agent left-hander John Tudor may become a member of the St. Louis 
Cardinals pitching staff again, if Manager Whitey Herzog gets his wish. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take him right away," Herzog said of Tudor, who pitched in just six games 
for the Dodgers last season after having off-season surgery on his left 
shoulder, elbow and knee. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at our situation, and we've got a lot of question marks. Not that 
John wouldn't be a question mark, but if he says he can pitch, he can pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor, 36, was a mainstay on the Cardinals' National League championship teams 
in 1985 and 1987 and compiled a 50-22 record in three-plus seasons before being 
traded to the Dodgers for first baseman Pedro Guerrero in August, 1988. He is 
said to be considering the Red Sox, because he lives in Boston, and the 
Cardinals.

Australians Peter Fowler and Wayne Grady both eagled the 12th hole today to 
combine for a 10-under-par 134 total to give Australia a 7-shot lead after the 
opening round of the World Cup golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler shot a 6-under 66, Grady a 68. Both three-putted the 18th green for 
bogeys, costing Fowler a chance at matching the course record of 65 first set 
by American Johnny Miller in this tournament in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, with Jose Maria Olazabal shooting a 70 and Jose Maria Canizares a 71, 
was in second place at 141. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Lanner birdied four of the last five holes for a 69 to combine with Ove 
Sellbers (73) for a 142 and third place for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champion United States was fourth at 143 as Paul Azinger (70) 
four-putted from just off the 18th green for a double bogey and Mark McCumber 
shot a 73 in a round marred by slow play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concentrating well," said Grady, who with Fowler had survived a 
72-hour trip from Australia marred by bad weather conditions in London and 
Malaga. The trip ended with the two sleeping in a rental car Tuesday night on a

Derrick Burroughs, a starting cornerback for the Buffalo Bills who was injured 
Sept. 24 in a game against Houston, will not play football with the Bills again 
after doctors discovered a spinal condition. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs, who was temporarily paralyzed after colliding with Oiler receiver 
Curtis Duncan and teammate Leonard Smith while making a tackle, has been 
advised by team physician Dr. Richard Weiss to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have warned the team that if Burroughs continues to play, he risks 
permanent paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a result of the sport, but something he brought to the sport," said 
Weiss on Wednesday. "With no injury, it would have gone undetected." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs was discovered to have cervical stenosis, a condition that has ended 
the careers of other NFL players, including Houston linebacker Frank Bush, 
Green Bay defensive back Tim Lewis and New England linebacker Don Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick has a cervical spine with two small rings, 64% of the size of normal 
rings," Weiss said. "When he hyperbends or hyperextends, it pinches the spinal 
cord and causes quadriplegia." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs made it clear that while his career in Buffalo is over, he might play 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"In the off-season, I might decide that I want to try it again with another 
team."

PETE ROSE WAGERS ON FANS' GULLIBILITY TO SELL HIS SIDE OF STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some friendly advice: Don't get too used to the idea of missing Pete Rose, 
because he is already back, and I don't think he ever plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
He's on "Donahue." He's on "20/20." He's on Home Shopping Network. I'm pretty 
sure that was Rose I saw next to Dan Rather climbing the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Pete Rose Rehab Tour (complete with T-shirts and autographed 
baseballs), coming to your town soon. Heck, he'll come to your house if you 
want. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Pete has to say: 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I may be a compulsive gambler and will seek care. (If that's what it takes 
to get everybody off my back and me into the Hall of Fame). No, I didn't bet on 
baseball. (That was the deal, remember? They kick me out of the game, but I get 
to say I didn't bet on baseball. Some bargain, huh?) So, let's forget all about 
it, but, first, why not buy my book? 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the book. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan has "My Turn," and Rose has "My Story." Don't bother to alert the 
Pulitzer committee in either case. Reagan talks at length about astrology, and 
you get the sense, after reading Rose's book, that Pete has his head in the 
clouds, too. What do you say, a round of sodium pentothal for everybody. On me. 
</P>
<P>
The book. It's by Pete Rose and Roger Kahn, who, in better days, wrote "The 
Boys of Summer." You know this because, in the author's note, Kahn says "The 
Boys of Summer" "became in many opinions . . . the classic baseball book; the 
classic baseball bestseller." Those are Kahn's italics and written perhaps in a 
desperate attempt to counter his co-author's claim later in the book that he, 
Rose, was the "best hitter you ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
We have the best hitter and the best writer and, as it turns out, the best 
apologia since former President Richard M. Nixon's memoirs. (Rose never read 
that one. In fact, by his own admission, Rose has written more books than he 
has read -- at last count, 15-2.) 
</P>
<P>
As we read on the inside flap of the book cover, this tome provides Rose the 
opportunity to tell his side of the story. "The day has finally come," it tells 
us, "to demolish the case against him. This, then, is 'Pete Rose: My Story.' " 
</P>
<P>
But first, we have to get through Rose's life and talk about the good times and 
explain away the bad. We learn that his ex-wife, Karolyn, is pretty much a 
vindictive shrew; that he left town the day his daughter was born to his 
present wife to hawk Pete Rose paraphernalia because she "wanted to be alone 
after the birth because she was exhausted"; that Rose settled a paternity suit 
against him out of court just to get it out of the papers; that his daughter, 
Fawn, who once said he was the worst father in the world, may not have meant it 
(although Kahn was apparently unable to interview her); and that his son, 
Petey, said that, OK, his dad wasn't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
We learned, too, that if Rose once used greenies, well, who didn't, and it sure 
doesn't compare to using cocaine. In sum, we learned nearly everyone loves 
Rose, and those who don't are out to get him, probably because they were 
jealous. 
</P>
<P>
Then we get to the meat of the story. Did he gamble? Yes, he says, but not on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, was he being persecuted? Kahn determines that it was all Sports 
Illustrated's fault for running a story about Rose's connection to gamblers and 
other unsavories. Apparently, then-Commissioner Peter Ueberroth was willing to 
sweep the matter under the table until SI, in order to sell more magazines, put 
the heat on. Then there was John Dowd, hired by the commissioner to investigate 
Rose and apparently out to make his case, no matter the truth. Here's where it 
gets interesting. 
</P>
<P>
First, Kahn likens Dowd to Joseph McCarthy and then, in a brilliant turn, 
brings up two claims brought against Dowd -- although in both cases, Kahn 
concedes, Dowd had been vindicated. In one case, Dowd sued for libel and won a 
$400,000 out-of-court settlement. In another, one of his clients, a convicted 
felon, sued Dowd, and Dowd won again. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn writes: "But an undeniable reality is that prosecutors and their incomes 
advance by means of convictions. Dowd's training is largely along prosecutorial 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
So, Dowd went after Rose, and A. Bartlett Giamatti went after Rose, and 
baseball was bent on bringing down one of its most marketable heroes. Makes 
sense. But why, we're left to wonder, if Rose is innocent, did he agree to a 
lifetime ban from baseball, even one that is subject to annual appeal? 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough one. But Rose, after some months, and maybe with some help, has 
found an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although he didn't bet on baseball and could have proved he 
didn't in a court of law, the commissioner would have blackballed him anyway 
for his association with gamblers and betting on other sports through bookies. 
Therefore, he got the commissioner to compromise, wherein there would be no 
finding on betting on baseball and he could apply for reinstatement after a 
year. What Rose failed to mention is that, under the rules of baseball, he 
could have reapplied after a year regardless of the terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't fail to mention this, however: "For the good of my family, myself, 
for baseball and even for the commissioner himself, the settlement was the 
right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
For the good of your family, yourself, for baseball and even for the 
commissioner, you can probably figure out whether it's worth $18.95, plus tax, 
to buy this book.
