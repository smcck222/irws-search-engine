FINALLY, A THAW AT THE 'WHITE LAKE'; 
</P>
<P>
BERLIN: THE WALL'S OPENING IS AS LARGE AND AS SMALL A MATTER AS BEING ABLE TO 
VISIT A GRANDFATHER'S GRAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Robert E. Dallos is a Times staff writer based in New 
York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I never knew my grandfather. He died in 1922, when my mother was 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But the past week's events in Germany have given me, from as far away as New 
York, a new sense of freedom. For the first time since I left Germany with my 
parents in 1936, a refugee from the Third Reich, I can visit my grandfather's 
grave without a hassle, without the long wait at the East Berlin border, 
without the indignity of intense questioning as to why I wanted to spend a few 
hours in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that the postwar partition left Weissensee, the landmark Jewish 
cemetery, in East Berlin, which today has a Jewish community of only 200 or so. 
In West Berlin, the Jewish community is a thriving 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the wall was put up, it was difficult for Westerners to get into 
the east zone to visit Weissensee, althought for some years now, rabbis and 
cantors from the West have been allowed to travel with mourners through 
Checkpoint Charlie and on to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
From 1880 until the Nazi persecution, Weissensee was the final resting place of 
Jews from all of Berlin. My grandfather, Sally Bacharach, lies in grave 62456, 
field B IV, row 15. Like so many of those resting nearby, he was, in a sense, 
fortunate. He didn't have to suffer under Hitler. He knew nothing of the Great 
Depression, the Cold War, nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Weissensee -- "White Lake" -- is a serene place, a monument to nearly a 
century of German Jewry's history. I have been back to Berlin half a dozen 
times. I have never failed to visit the cemetery, to clean the ivy growth off 
the gravestone whose lettering has been greatly but not entirely eroded by 
nearly 70 years of summers and winters, storms and winds and political change. 
</P>
<P>
My great-grandparents, Heymann and Emelie Nathan, are also buried there, but 
the exact location of their graves has eluded me. They are in a section of 
Weissensee damaged during the intensive bombing of Berlin by American planes 
near the war's end. It is now covered by underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Weissensee, about a 10-minute car ride into East Berlin, is a sad 
lesson in the history of modern German Jewry. Here lie many who died when 
royalty ruled. Others are in a field of honor that contains graves of the 
Jewish soldiers who gave their lives for Germany in World War I. (My father, 
Arthur Dzialoszynski, was wounded in combat and awarded the Iron Cross. His 
brother, Salo, did not survive his wounds; he died on his 28th birthday, while 
en route home for medical treatment.) Twenty years later, the relatives of the 
honored dead were being rounded up, to end their lives in places like Dachau 
and Auschwitz. As late as 1936, four years into the Hitler regime, 
German-Jewish veterans still commemorated their military service with 
ceremonies at Weissensee. 
</P>
<P>
Now the veterans, too, are only a memory, but evidence of the evil days 
abounds. Sigmund Deutsch and his wife Martha, for example, are buried together. 
They died on the same day, Oct. 22, 1942. They had committed suicide, unable to 
carry on. They are only two of the 811 Jews who took their own lives that year 
as an alternative to being hauled off to concentration camps. There is the 
single monument in memory of Mendel Wachsmann, born May 21, 1886, murdered Feb. 
4, 1941, at Sachenhausen; Georg Wachsmann, born April 27, 1918, killed May 27, 
1942, and Leo Wachsmann, born Feb. 11, 1923, died in Auschwitz sometime in 
1943. A father and his two sons, the whereabouts of their real graves unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, lie those who died when the century was new and full of promise. 
Their remains are marked by simple headstones and ostentatious mausoleums. 
There is one row of Berlin's rabbis. Another contains the most prominent Jewish 
physicians, among them Abraham Adolf Baer, Adolf Baginsky, Albert Fraenkel. 
Theodore Wolff, the editor of the Berliner Tagesblatt, and jurist Eugen Fuchs 
are buried here. 
</P>
<P>
As events unfold now, one thing is clear: Weissensee cemetery belongs to all of 
Berlin once again. And my grandfather is a bit closer. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is gone.

EAST GERMANY'S NEW ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By yesterday, 9.5 million of East Germany's 16.5 million citizens had applied 
for and received foreign travel visas in the week since the country threw open 
its borders. That staggering statistic speaks volumes about the frustration and 
explosive claustrophobia affecting the long-penned-in populace. Not all visa 
holders, to be sure, plan an early test of their new travel freedom -- although 
on Friday alone more than a million crossed into West Germany -- and probably 
only a small number of those who do go out will choose not to return. But when 
60% of the population shows that it has one eye on the exit, a powerful message 
is being sent. 
</P>
<P>
The regime is responding to that message by shaking up both the government and 
the Communist Party hierarchy and by promising changes to make more credible 
the image of "socialism with a human face." That phrase, which has been 
recurring for decades in Eastern Europe, seeks to suggest greater tolerance in 
social and intellectual affairs along with expanded material comforts, all 
under the continuing rule of the party. As far as the country's economic future 
is concerned, Prime Minister Hans Modrow says he's ready to allow more 
small-scale private enterprise, for example in retail trade. But he 
specifically rejects any major turn toward a free market. His plan is to tinker 
with the system, not overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans will, however, see more political power-sharing than ever before, 
thanks to the new prominence given four small parties that heretofore had only 
token representation in government. Power sharing in this case, though, is not 
the same thing as a real sharing of power. Although the non-Communist parties 
have 11 seats in the new cabinet, the commanding heights of government -- the 
ministries of defense, interior, foreign affairs, finance, economy -- will 
continue to be firmly under Communist control. 
</P>
<P>
All this is unquestionably reform even if, in the light of recent events, it is 
reform at the bare minimum. The chance of far greater change in the near future 
nonetheless exists. For one thing, the free elections that party boss Egon 
Krenz has promised by 1991, along with a potential resuscitation of the 
non-Communist parties, points to the possible emergence of a real political 
opposition. Also, the simple unpredictability of events could force the 
country's rulers to move faster and farther than they would like. The regime's 
first need, as it well knows, is to try to gain greater credibility and popular 
confidence. Those 9.5 million travel visas that East Germans have claimed 
indicate how formidable that task is.

LET HISTORY BE OUR GUIDE; 
</P>
<P>
GERMANY: THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA GOT A BAD PRESS, BUT IT BROUGHT ON A LONG 
PEACE. TODAY'S SUPERPOWER LEADERS NEED TO KEEP THAT LESSON IN MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LUKACS, John Lukacs' latest book is Budapest 1900 (Weidenfeld &amp; 
Nicolson, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two historical coincidences come to mind as one contemplates the fabulous 
events in East Germany and East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
One is the period from 1933 to 1989. The Wall was erected in 1961, 28 years 
ago. That was 28 years after Adolf Hitler had become the chancellor of Germany, 
in 1933. Hitler's principal aim was to unite all of German-speaking Europe into 
a Great German Reich that would dominate the Continent and whose people would 
become the master race in the European East. He failed. The result of the World 
War that Hitler had unleashed was the division of Germany, the division of 
Europe and the division of Berlin. The division of the latter began immediately 
after the end of the war, but did not become final until September, 1961, when 
the East German government felt compelled to close the last half-open hole 
across that division by building the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
That monstrous and unnatural edifice sealed the division of Berlin and of 
Germany. But history is never of one piece. At the very time when the Berlin 
Wall was put into place, in the 1960s, the Iron Curtain separating other 
Eastern European states from the West was beginning to open, here and there, 
for the purposes of trade and mass tourism. By the 1970s, the contacts between 
the two Germanys began to improve and increase. And now -- principally because 
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- things have begun to speed up and 
the Berlin Wall is gone. How and when the reunification of the two Germanys 
will take place we do not know. That it will take place (and that in some forms 
it is already taking place) is almost certain. 
</P>
<P>
Thereby, in 1989, the principal legacy of World War II has come to an end. 
Hitler's Germany was crushed by the coalition of the English-speaking 
democracies and the Soviet Union. It was a war that neither of these 
then-allies could have won alone. After the war, and in view of the threatening 
presence of Soviet armies and of communism on one side of the Iron Curtain, a 
Western European-American alliance was formed that contributed to the lasting 
division of Europe. Anti-communist propaganda notwithstanding, American and 
Atlantic Alliance policy never challenged the Soviet domination of Eastern 
Europe -- not only because of the prospects of potential war but because a 
Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe would have to be accompanied by an 
American withdrawal from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe has begun. It is proceeding 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
The dangerous prospect ahead of us is not really that of a reunited Germany. It 
is that of an American-Soviet struggle for the favors of a reuniting, though 
not-yet-reunited, Germany. If, in exchange for a Soviet military withdrawal 
from Eastern Germany and Eastern Europe, the American government would agree to 
an American military withdrawal from Western Germany and Western Europe, that 
would be one thing. But I doubt whether the Bush Administration would be 
willing to consider that. President Bush has not yet spoken out unequivocally 
in favor of a united Germany. But I fear that he will not be immune to the 
temptation to do so. This then could lead to an ominous conflict with a Soviet 
Union that would either oppose a united German state or agree to it only after 
a withdrawal of both superpowers from the center of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This brings me to the second historical coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
At the Congress of Vienna, in 1814-15, the crowned heads and statesmen of 
Europe and England came together to restore some kind of order on the continent 
after 25 years of the French revolution and Napoleonic wars. Some of their 
decisions were good ones, others were not. By and large the Congress of Vienna 
had a bad press -- like Yalta 130 years later. But it was not until the 20th 
Century that a new kind of retrospect began to emerge. The Congress of Vienna 
had not been so bad, after all. It had contributed to what may be called A 
Hundred Years' Peace -- a time that brought about the greatest growth of 
prosperity and liberty in the Western world, in Europe as well as in America. 
There were no world wars from 1815 to 1914. The Congress of Vienna established 
that there were five great European powers: Britain, France, Austria, Prussia 
and Russia. That relative standing remained for a century -- except for one 
important change that came 40-some years after the Congress of Vienna. Prussia 
was transforming itself into a united Germany, powerful enough to endanger the 
European balance of power, although another half-century passed until the 
unwisdom of its leaders contributed to World War I. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945 the Yalta Conference led to the division of Europe, and then to that of 
Germany, and of Berlin. It also led to 44 years of relative peace. As after 
1815, there were wars -- in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, the Middle East -- but 
like most wars during the 19th Century, they were small. The superpowers did 
not fight each other directly. That was not the result of the wisdom of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Josef Stalin. It was the result of many things, 
including the existence of atom bombs. Nevertheless, there it was. And now, 44 
years after Yalta and the last world war -- just as in the 1860s, 44 years 
after the Napoleonic world wars -- a great change has come: the union of the 
two Germanys is around the corner again. 
</P>
<P>
History does not repeat itself. In the 1860s the architect of German unity was 
Bismarck. There is not such a man today; neither are the German people of today 
the people of Hitler's time. Gorbachev is not Stalin. Bush is not Roosevelt. 
But, while history does not repeat itself, it remains the only guide for the 
present and the future. It will take much knowledge of history, much courage, 
and much insight on the part of the United States to understand some of the 
prospects of what is now happening. It calls for an honest recognition of many 
things, including the interests of the Soviet empire itself. It calls for a 
serious and judicious recognition of dangers -- dangers not at all restricted 
to a united Germany but to all kinds of populist pressures from the Third World 
that threaten the vital interests of the United States as well as the Soviet 
Union. It calls for an authentic effort to listen to each other, to talk at 
length, a practice that cannot be achieved or even initiated during a two-day 
summit. The Congress of Vienna was many things. A photo opportunity it was not.

THE NATURE OF YELLOWSTONE'S FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like old wars, the Yellowstone forest fires of 1988 will be refought time and 
time again. The more the fires are studied, along with the conditions that led 
to them, the better equipped scientists and Park Service officials will be to 
manage the nation's wilderness and parklands in sensible fashion. As two 
experts note in the November issue of Scientific American, the most obvious 
lesson of the summer of 1988 is a reaffirmation of the obvious: "that nature is 
complex, subtle and not always easily controlled." 
</P>
<P>
The authors also reached some interesting specific conclusions. William H. 
Romme of Fort Lewis College and Don G. Despain, a research biologist at 
Yellowstone, said the fires were more or less a natural event of the sort that 
might occur every 200 to 300 years, regardless of human efforts to control 
them. Their work indicates that the fires probably behaved very much like ones 
that burned across the same area about 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They also rejected the theory that one reason the 1988 fires were so extensive 
was that vigorous fire suppression programs had permitted the buildup of forest 
cover and other fuel. While Yellowstone was established as a national park in 
1872, fire control really was not very effective until almost the middle of 
this century, the researchers said. If massive fires occur naturally every 200 
to 400 years, they added, then 30 or 40 years of suppression was not long 
enough for such quantities of fuel to accumulate. The 1988 fires came, finally, 
when they did because of an unusual combination of dry, hot and windy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Romme and Despain did not make specific recommendations about future fire 
management programs. But their findings seem to reinforce the concept of 
allowing lightning fires to burn naturally in the future. That may not prevent 
another catastrophic fire two or three centuries from now, but could reduce its 
severity even though the area burned each summer may be quite small. 
</P>
<P>
The Romme-Despain study further contradicts the irate snap judgments of 
politicians a year ago that the Park Service's so-called "let-burn" policy was 
responsible for letting the 1988 fires get out of control. They conclude that 
the natural conditions that existed in Yellowstone last year would have 
overwhelmed any such human endeavor. And tourism figures this year put to rest 
the fears of the same politicians that the area would suffer economically 
because of the stigma of the giant burn. In fact, more tourists flocked to 
Yellowstone than in almost any other year in history precisely because they 
wanted to see the results of the fires and witness the magical rebirth of 
Yellowstone plant life in 1989 from the ashes of 1988.

<P>
Your Nov. 10 headline "East Germany Opens Borders" was electrifying despite the 
other stunning news in the Eastern Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have expected all these changes to take place in our lifetime? Some 
of us even thought that it would take a world war to bring about these 
upheavals.

Now instead of stockpiling our nuclear arsenals we should devote our energy and 
resources to combatting crimes, eradicating drugs, perfecting our means of 
production and developing the system that can enhance the quality of life in 
this planet.

After reading Pat Buchanan's piece on President Bush ("We'll All Soon Know What 
Bush Is Made Of," Op-Ed Page, Nov. 5), my immediate response is: Doesn't 
Buchanan know the difference between a fascist and a Marxist? How can a 
Marxist-Leninist like Daniel Ortega also be a fascist? That is like Ronald 
Reagan advocating total government intervention for all problems.

WILL ON CAMPUS CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Will's insightful article on censorship on college campuses I 
find myself in complete agreement with his point that the prevailing mood on 
campuses has given rise to rules on sensitivity that are in fact censorship on 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Will did not go far enough in his description of censorship because as a 
college student I have noticed something even more insidious and intellectually 
stifling than the open and overt censorship that he describes. Both in class 
discussions and discussions with professors there seems to be an underlying 
fear to clearly state one's opinion regarding anything pertaining to racial and 
interracial relationships. Instead every speaker, including the professor, 
tends to perform a dance of words so as not to offend this minority or that one 
realizing that one misstep could bring on a mob of self-anointed protectors of 
one group or another. Discussions of this kind are more often than not pitiful 
exercises in self-affirmations of how wonderfully consensual everyone is. 
Nothing was said -- discussion is over -- great class. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of discussion is so stifled that often when a speaker is about 
to make a point about race relations that could in some way be misconstrued as 
a racist remark he will often scan the room to ascertain if a minority person 
is present and if there is, the point that was about to be made is wrapped in 
such obfuscating language that one wonders if there was a point at all. I think 
if this continues discussions on the weather will be more stimulating than 
discussions of anything socially relevant.

WILL ON CAMPUS CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column "U.S. Campuses Are Putting Sensitivity Police on Patrol" (Op-Ed 
Page, Nov. 5), George Will displays not only his customary arrogance, but a 
great deal of ignorance as well. I strongly disagree with his labeling of 
college and university policies which discourage racism, sexism and homophobia 
as "censorship." Will forgets that one of the primary reasons one attends an 
institution of higher learning is to expand one's understanding of the world 
outside of the household and neighborhood. It is for this reason that nearly 
all four-year colleges require a core curriculum which includes courses in 
world history and literature. 
</P>
<P>
Many students come to college from sheltered backgrounds, lacking awareness of 
and sensitivity to many issues of race and gender. Is it wrong for a school to 
promote student awareness of these issues? Awareness cannot be fostered in an 
environment where intolerance and abuse are considered acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Will wrongly proclaims that attempts to reduce overt racism and sexism are a 
liberal plot. Is it only liberals who would like to see an atmosphere of 
tolerance and understanding on our college campuses? Is it only liberals who 
feel that all college students, regardless of race, gender or sexual 
preference, should be free to pursue a course of study without fear of slurs 
being yelled when they enter a cafeteria, or school newspaper articles 
circulating derision? 
</P>
<P>
Will insults Republicans by suggesting that only liberals encourage an 
environment of tolerance in our institutions, and he insults everyone by 
implying that if we do not stand up and cheer for bigots, we are denying the 
bigots their rights.

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I have followed the events in Berlin. When the "crossing" was 
announced, tears formed in my eyes. I was dramatically reminded of our 
country's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
A generation of Germans was permitted to experience what we, as Americans, can 
take for granted. We visited East and West Berlin a few years ago. To see the 
city, the wall, and the Brandenburg Gate from both sides was sobering. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is now breached! Surely it must give genuine happiness for Americans 
to know that native Berliners are now granted the privilege of visiting a part 
of their own city.

VANDALIZING U.S. FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your insistence that any vandalism or desecration of the American flag 
represents some bellwether of national freedom ("Reason Wins a Round," 
editorial, Oct. 23) is sheer fantasy. In an effort to prop up your uninformed 
opinion, you cite a so-called conservative spokesman, who earlier opined that 
the Bill of Rights protects speech, no matter how offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Both of you are wrong. The Bill of Rights protects free speech, but certainly 
not unlimited speech. Further, those who would wrap themselves in 
constitutional broadcloth as protection against their libel, slander, riot, or 
advocacy of violent sedition have seldom found legal sanctuary in the 
Constitution and Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Neither are "fighting words" protected speech. To anyone who has ever walked 
along the quietly elegant rows of simple white markers at a veterans cemetery 
and contemplated the supreme sacrifice those honored dead gave for our flag, it 
is most assuredly "fighting words" when, in the name of "free speech," that 
ensign of liberty is vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
If such an atrocity does not heighten your sense of outrage enough to protect 
that precious symbol, feel free to crawl back underneath your constitutional 
theory, but do not expect any patriot to join you.

EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the last few months I have been watching, reading, and thinking about the 
seemingly momentous events occurring in this world of ours. I am a strong 
national security advocate (went to West Point and work in the defense 
industry), and yet I find myself wondering if I should change careers. The 
Berlin Wall is coming down and I am greatly moved. To all those who would 
continue to subvert the will of the people I say, let freedom ring and 
democracy reign so that "government of the people, by the people and for the 
people shall" spread throughout this earth. 
</P>
<P>
Let us rejoice and act that our peoples may move forward, together, as there is 
much to do. There are scourges that must be addressed; toxic wastes, poverty, 
homelessness, alcoholism, disease, natural disasters, a failing infrastructure 
of roads, bridges, dams, and an environment that bleeds and cries for help. As 
I look in wonderment at these incredible times, sensing vast changes, I am 
grateful to God, and ask how can I help? The Statue of Liberty must have wiped 
some tears away as her arms spread its welcome to our Eastern Bloc friends. I 
know I did.

MAGIC'S EJECTION LEFT FAN DEJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine my excitement going to the Lakers' opener and getting to see an 
injury-free Magic Johnson back in action. Imagine my rage 3 1/2 minutes into 
the game when the official threw the league's MVP (and the Suns' Kevin Johnson) 
out of the game for a harmless shoving match. I appreciate the officials trying 
to keep the game clean, but when they deny 17,000 high-paying customers the 
right to see their hero because of a silly scrape, the NBA has committed the 
ultimate technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
If the league expects fans to pay to see their game, they better provide the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
And shame on referees Bill Oakes, Greg Willard and David Jones. The 
double-ejection was a gutsy call. And totally brainless.

READER DOESN'T GO EASY ON RACE WRITER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't Bill Christine accept reality? Apparently, he still believes that 
Easy Goer is the top 3-year-old, even though he has lost three of four to 
Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
His comment that Sunday Silence is better, "but not by much," sounds like a 
typical broken-down horseplayer explaining why he should have cashed his most 
recent bet. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it just possible that Whittingham's horse wins because he is superior, by 
quite a margin, and that the fluke in the series with Easy Goer was the 
Belmont, run in the latter's back yard?

BASKETBALL: THEY GET FOUR DAYS OFF IN WHICH TO WORK HARPER, BENJAMIN INTO 
LINEUP AFTER A 122-105 LOSS TO MAVERICKS.

<P>
Break time. Or is it a standing-eight count? 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers returned home early this morning to begin a four-day layoff from 
games -- time enough, they hope, to heal wounds to the body and pride. Both 
have taken a few knocks, and some areas aren't healing so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
A 122-105 loss to the Dallas Mavericks Friday night before 16,983 at Reunion 
Arena left the Clippers 2-5 and losers of four of their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
"The two times we've played them, once you really get up on them and pressure 
them and are passing the ball, they quit," Maverick rookie Randy White said 
after his 18-point, nine-rebound performance in 21 minutes. "I saw them die 
tonight. But nothing against them, we played good ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Right, but nothing against them. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers needed that. They're hurting enough, physically. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Patient No. 1, Ken Norman. Condition: Problem arms. 
</P>
<P>
He hurt his left hand in training camp, although he still hasn't figured how. 
That having healed, he injured his right wrist during a fall against the 
Houston Rockets on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The wrist, cleared by X-rays, is taped almost every time Norman goes out. It is 
soaked in warm water much of the day. It isn't helping much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting worse," he said. "It keeps hurting every game, basically. It's 
real difficult to shoot, at practice especially, because I don't have the time 
to get loose like during the course of a game." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' leading scorer last season is shooting 53.3%, but he took only 
five shots Thursday night at Houston. Norman appeared healthier against the 
Mavericks, hitting 11 of 17 attempts, including many jump shots, for a 
game-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the hand loosens up, it's all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Patient No. 2, Tom Garrick. Condition: Sprained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
It may be tough to notice, but Garrick is still bothered by the injury that 
kept him out of the game against New York on Nov. 11. He began the night as the 
NBA's fourth-best shooter at 64.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts when I run and gets stiff when I sit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to recent X-rays, it's nothing worse then a bad bruise. He said 
he hopes the time away from games will finally heal the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a center in the house? 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin ended his holdout and signed Thursday. The Clippers will take 
advantage of the off-days to get him into the flow after missing all of 
training camp and the first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper, the shooting guard acquired in the Clippers' trade Thursday, should 
expect big minutes early on, so the next four days, before New Jersey comes to 
the Sports Arena, will be very important for him, too. 
</P>
<P>
A new center -- though not necessarily an immediate starter -- and a new 
shooting guard. It'll be sort of like training camp revisited. 
</P>
<P>
"It will help us tremendously," Garrick said. "Not only will it heal the wounds 
we have presently, but it should also help the new guys make a transition into 
the system." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, whose bench was outscored, 53-35, provided some remedy for Dallas 
during its time of crisis. A 1-4 start before winning two in a row was bad 
enough, but to have Roy Tarpley, the league's leading rebounder, suspended 
indefinitely, compounded an already bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting 56.8% and having seven players score in double figures helped the 
Mavericks. Every little bit helps these days, though. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the win) was important in many ways," said Rolando Blackman, who tied Herb 
Williams for game-high honors with 19 points. "It's the start of a new season, 
and this sort of relieves a mental burden. If we would have lost, it would have 
been, 'What if Roy was here? How much do you need him?' It moves that back a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
Instant anesthetic. After providing it, the Clippers have four days to discover 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers cleared a roster spot for Benoit Benjamin Friday by waiving 
Torgeir Bryn, who played 10 minutes in three of the first six games. Ron 
Harper, acquired in the trade that sent Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny 
Ferry to Cleveland, and Benjamin are both expected to practice Sunday at the 
Sports Arena. . . .Benjamin's agent, Henry Holmes, disputes any notion that the 
7-foot center's new contract was a step backward from what the Clippers offered 
before a brief jump to Italy. "The deal is better than what he earned last year 
and better than what the Clippers originally offered before he went to Italy," 
Holmes said, noting the package for 1989-90 could reach $1.85 million if all 
incentives bonuses are reached. "There was a lot of give and take between the 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
The reunion at Reunion never took place. Former University of Michigan 
teammates Gary Grant of the Clippers, Roy Tarpley of the Mavericks and Glen 
Rice of the Miami Heat planned to get together sometime Friday or Saturday, but 
Tarpley's indefinite suspension without pay after being arrested Thursday for 
driving while intoxicated took care of that. Grant tried calling Tarpley during 
the afternoon, but found the number had been disconnected. The Heat play the 
Mavericks tonight. . . .The 82 points the Clippers scored in Thursday's loss at 
Houston was their lowest offensive output since scoring 75 points March 1, 
1988, at New Jersey.

The Golden State Warriors, one of the big surprises in the NBA last season, are 
off to a slow start this season.

Dell Curry sank a three-pointer at the buzzer Friday night at Charlotte to give 
the Hornets a 99-98 victory and drop the Warriors' record to 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Rod Higgins gave the Warriors a 98-96 lead with 52 seconds 
left, but they contributed to their own downfall when they failed to beat the 
24-second clock on two of their last three possessions. 
</P>

Tyrone Bogues, who has 46 assists in the last three games, controlled the ball 
in the closing seconds, then passed it to the left corner to Curry, who made

Forward Larry Johnson scored 25 points and top-ranked Nevada Las Vegas blew 
open the game in the first half to beat California, 101-81, Friday night at Las 
Vegas and advance to the semifinals of the preseason National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 17 of his points during the first half, when the Runnin' Rebels 
used two 11-0 runs to take control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, with Johnson scoring 11 of his points during the spurt, outscored Cal, 
33-12, the last 9:30 of the first half to take a 48-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Hunt added 16 for UNLV (2-0), which cleared its bench midway through 
the second half when it led by as many as 33. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Smith had 22 points for California (1-1), and Roy Fisher added 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas 89, Louisiana State 83 -- The Jayhawks went over the top of the 
second-ranked Tigers' towering lineup as Terry Brown led a long-range attack at 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made four three-point shots in a 2:27 span of the first half as Kansas 
overcame a seven-point deficit and took a 29-27 lead. LSU regained the lead at 
65-63 with 9:30 left in the game, but Kevin Pritchard and Mark Randall made 
baskets to put Kansas ahead to stay.

LSU's sophomore guard Chris Jackson made a three-point shot with 41 seconds 
left, but with Kansas ahead by four, missed twice from three-point range in the 
final 23 seconds. Jeff Gueldner made two free throws for Kansas with two 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson led the Tigers with 32 points, but made only 11 of 30 shots, including 
four of 10 three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Randall led Kansas with 25 points and Gueldner had 16. For LSU, 7-foot Stanley 
Roberts had 12 points and 7-2 Shaquille O'Neal had 10. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul 70, North Carolina State 63 -- Stephen Howard made a basket and four 
free throws in the last 2:12 and the Blue Demons' pressure defense effectively 
handled the Wolfpack's outstanding backcourt duo of Rodney Monroe and Chris 
Corchiani, holding them to seven points in the final 11 minutes at the Rosemont 
Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
With DePaul leading, 60-56, Howard intercepted a pass and hit a short jumper, 
but Monroe, who had 22 points, made a layup with 1:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack got the ball back, but this time DePaul's Curtis Price made a 
steal and Kevin Holland made a 15-foot jumper. With 55 seconds remaining, 
Holland made a steal and Howard made two free throws for a 66-58 lead.

<P>
DERBY COULD BE A BATTLE OF CHARLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can Charlie deal with Charlie? 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the questions that will be answered Sunday in the 49th running 
of the $200,000 Hollywood Derby at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Charlie Barley, the 3-year-old Canadian colt, will be outnumbered by 
the forces of Charlie Whittingham, the 76-year-old Southland trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to win the Grade I Derby for only the second time this decade, 
Whittingham will enter four horses -- River Master, Seven Rivers, Live the 
Dream and Shining Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four has reason to succeed. River Master is the most accomplished, 
having won stakes at Del Mar and Bay Meadows, in addition to running second 
behind Hawkster in the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
He bombed in his most recent appearance, winding up eighth in the Volante 
Handicap at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. Eddie Delahoussaye, riding the colt 
for the first time, said he thought something was bothering River Master, who 
was trying to run wide the entire journey. 
</P>
<P>
However, the son of His Majesty came out of the race well and his recent works 
have been sharp. Chris McCarron, who has ridden him in each of his four 
victories, will be aboard Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Rivers, after being unable to break his maiden in four tries last year, 
has blossomed as a 3-year-old, winning four of five since returning to the 
races, including a 7-1 upset in the Volante. 
</P>
<P>
Live the Dream was fifth in a pair of races at Del Mar, then turned things 
around when he got to Santa Anita. After just missing in an allowance race, the 
Northern Baby colt surprised older horses in the Henry P. Russell Handicap as 
Robbie Davis scraped him through the narrowest of openings along the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Shining Steel, winner of three of eight starts in England, has been training 
well for his U.S. debut. He is owned by King owner Bruce McNall and his star, 
Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
The four comprise a powerful Team Whittingham, but Charlie Barley has the 
credentials to make this a profitable invasion. Trained by Grant Pearce and 
owned by Scott Abbott and John Haney, the son of Affirmed has been a model of 
consistency throughout his 18-race career. 
</P>
<P>
He has failed to finish in the money only three times and is equally at home on 
dirt or turf, the surface on which the Derby will be contested at 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Regular rider Robin Platts thinks that grass is Charlie Barley's preference, 
and this is the root of a good-natured, year-long argument between him and 
Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something Robin and I have had a lot of fun with," Pearce said. "I'm 
not convinced he's better on either. He's pretty consistent and runs well on 
both surfaces." 
</P>
<P>
Platts, who was third aboard Carotene in the 1986 Yellow Ribbon Stakes on one 
of his two previous trips to California, thinks the distance and the Hollywood 
Park course will suit the half-brother to 1987 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner 
Success Express. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it stays firm and he's running strictly against 3-year-olds at a 
mile and an eighth, he's got a very good chance," Platts said. 
</P>
<P>
"He breezed real well this morning (three furlongs in :35 2/5). He's kind of a 
moody horse who likes to be pampered but he always tries." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Charlie Barley was third in the Rothmans International over soft 
going. Two races before, he lost by a half-length to Breeders' Cup Turf winner 
Prized in the Molson Million on the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have won the Rothmans on a firm turf course," Platts said. "They 
didn't catch him until the last eighth of a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Purchased for $50,000 at Keeneland two summers ago, Charlie Barley began his 
career by running second in a stakes and has since earned more than $675,000. 
</P>
<P>
When an anticipated invitation to the Japan Cup didn't come, it was decided 
that the Hollywood Derby would be his last race of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shortening him up a bit -- I think his best distance is a mile and an 
eighth to a mile and a quarter -- and we're running strictly against 
3-year-olds," Pearce said. "There aren't any other races for 3-year-olds now, 
so this looked like the right spot when we didn't get invited to Japan. After 
this, we'll send him to Florida for a rest. 
</P>
<P>
"He's coming up to the race super. He breezed real well and I'm very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Whittingham foursome and Charlie Barley, nine others entered the 
Derby, which continues to be a popular event. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen started last year's Derby, and the race was split into divisions the 
previous seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Sunday's field are Raise a Stanza, third in the Volante; Go Milord, a 
European making his American debut for Wayne Lukas; Broto, who has three 
victories on on grass against lesser imports, Gauntlett Boy; Fast 'n' Gold; One 
Drink; Art Work and Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
The main event on today's program is the $75,000 Hollywood Turf Express at six 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the lineup is Sunny Blossom, who finished a distant second to Sam Who 
in Oak Tree's Ancient Title Handicap, his first race in more than seven months. 
Making only his second start on grass, Eddie Gregson's gelding drew the rail 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The highweight for the Express is Oraibi, back from Maryland after finishing 
second in the Laurel Dash. He returned with a :58 2/5 workout at Santa Anita 
for Richard Mandella and will be ridden by Laffit Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered are California Jade, Summer Sale, You're No Bargain, Undercut 
(also out of the Gregson barn), Star Cutter (who ran some strong races here at 
this distance during the summer), Cutter Sam, Bit of a Lark and Ofanto. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, whose number was taken down in the Breeders' Cup Sprint for 
interference shortly after the start, skipped the Express in favor of the 
National Sprint Championship Dec. 16. . . . Look for a change in the official 
program sold at Hollywood Park. The odds will return to their traditional spot, 
and most of the information supplied by the Daily Racing Form will be 
eliminated. All that will be kept is the horse's record in 1989 plus its turf 
record when applicable. . . . All Hollywood Derby entrants will carry 122 
pounds. . . . For the first time at the meeting, the Pick Six fell Friday. 
Because of some short fields and equally short prices, there were 49 perfect 
tickets, each worth $4,057.40.

OFF-AND-ON FUNDING FOR DISPUTED ART SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Allan Parachini's "Arts Groups Say NEA Future at Risk," Nov. 10: 
</P>
<P>
With the rush to freedom of thousands of East Germans and others being 
celebrated in the media as the death knell of repressive communism, it is 
painfully ironic that the Bush Administration chooses this time to eviscerate 
the National Endowment for the Arts by appointing as chairman an apparatchik 
who is terrorized by the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer's justification for pulling funding from a New York 
art show -- that "the show had become so politicized that it no longer met 
artistic criteria" -- should be cause for his immediate removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
If art is to be funded only when it is unpolitical or (worse) apolitical, then 
we shall soon be seeking political asylum on the other side of the Berlin Wall, 
because that's where the freedom of expression will be if we keep this up! 
</P>
<P>
LOUIS FANTASIA 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The NEA reversed its course Thursday and agreed to release $10,000 in grant 
money for the New York exhibition, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." Last 
week, Frohnmayer had ordered the money impounded because of what he called the 
"political orientation" of the AIDS-related exhibition and its catalogue, in 
particular.

INSULT TO SOVIET VISITORS?

<P>
Re Donna Perlmutter's critique of the Red Army Chorus: I am convinced that with 
the ingrained attitudes and low level of public awareness in the "Free" World, 
the Cold War will never end ("The Red Army Chorus -- A Show of Strength, 
Inside, Outside Shrine," Nov. 4). It was a display of mass rudeness for the 
Armenians -- "1,000 protesting emigres" -- to insult the members of the Red 
Army Chorus, guests of the United States. It is a sad commentary on the brave 
new world when art has to be used as a political weapon.

<P>
I am neither Catholic nor Jewish, and I want to say that I loved Jackie Mason's 
character on "Chicken Soup." 
</P>
<P>
My word, he was always handing out sensible advice, saving the situation and 
being funny at the same time! What could possibly have offended the Jewish 
people? 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, the Irish should have been offended. The program showed the Irishman 
in a much less attractive light.

Jackie Mason, star of the canceled "Chicken Soup," continues to claim he is not 
a racist. But in the Nov. 10 Morning Report, he is quoted as saying that "black 
columnists . . . feel if they don't have anybody to call a racist then they 
don't have anything to write about." That is tolerant indeed. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to the criticism of his comments about the New York mayoral 
campaign, Mason is quoted as saying that the racism charges against him are 
motivated by "sick guilt" and that "any decent person would feel stupid for 
calling me a racist." If he doesn't want to be called a racist, I suggest that 
he try thinking before he opens his mouth. I am one decent person who has no 
sick guilt about loathing a man who, in addition to slandering other groups, 
demeans his own by playing a stereotype in a weekly sitcom.

'TOWARD THE 21ST CENTURY' -- ENERGETICALLY; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: A FESTIVAL OF PIECES BY BLACK CHOREOGRAPHERS UNDERLINES THE CONTRIBUTION 
AND CONTINUING RICHNESS OF THIS TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a showcase for artists who gained national recognition during the past 
decade, "Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" is a festival 
that reminds everyone how central people of color have been to the avant garde. 
That alone would make it an important event, and it's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wadsworth Theater (where performances continue through Sunday), there 
are eight companies -- a slightly different lineup than the festival presented 
in San Francisco earlier this month. All of them have danced in Southern 
California before, but the new context encourages a major shift in audience 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Guided by panels and program essays, we are invited to consider these artists 
less as firebrands of an evolving and often rootless postmodernism than as 
linked to black American cultural traditions. We are prodded to examine 
cross-cultural influences -- on them, from them -- and to think about the 
continuum between choreographers who just happen to be black and those 
exclusively involved with issues of black identity. 
</P>
<P>
There's much to learn, and unlearn, and sometimes the choreographers are no 
help at all, since they are absorbed in processes of art-making rather than 
supplying footnotes to somebody's thesis. Not incidentally, the dominant theme 
of the four-part Thursday program was risk -- from Dimensions Dance Theater 
venturing the technical hazards of a piece by Garth Fagan (and not really 
succeeding) to Bill T. Jones daring to abandon dance altogether and confront 
his mother with profound questions about suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Set to taped pieces by Steve Reich and Abdullah Ibrahim, Fagan's 1984 
"Yesterday/Yesternow" alternated between small-scale, gestural motion and 
expansive, formal passages punctuated with propulsive jumps and sustained tests 
of balance. Dancers individualized by mime motifs (a scooping/reaching action, 
for example) were suddenly swept up in whole-body and then group statements. 
Later on, Fagan restructured these components in solos built on brilliant 
physical appositions. 
</P>
<P>
This demanding style may be second nature by now to Fagan's own company, but 
Oakland-based Dimensions is not yet in that league. Unisons frequently looked 
slovenly on Thursday, solos strained -- though Anisa Rasheed as the lady in the 
tiger-striped top and Ian Vincent McGinnis in the "Man" variation worked 
diligently through their challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' "Faith II: Work-in-Progress" began with him in the middle of the stage, 
his mother, Estella Jones, reading the Bible from a table on the right and then 
his sister, Flo Brown, singing gospel-style songs with Craig Brown at a 
microphone on the left. 
</P>
<P>
His solo had the superb pliancy and deep passion of someone born and schooled 
for greatness, but soon he stopped dancing to speak his feelings about AIDS, 
homophobia (with a bitter reference to Eddie Murphy) and Christianity as "a 
religion of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared, momma," he cried, and Estella Jones attempted to comfort him, 
repeating that "we're living in the last days," in a tormented world, and 
sharing her own early crisis of belief. 
</P>
<P>
Was this extraordinary conversation planned as performance art, an act of 
public therapy or part of a workshop process? Ultimately it doesn't matter. In 
making his pain a family affair and including us at the table, Bill T. Jones 
involved us in an act of trust that restored theater to its ancient role in 
communal healing. 
</P>
<P>
John Pickett's "Things Fall Apart" for the locally based Spotted Leopard Dance 
Company also traced an interior journey, as two nearly nude men (Pickett and 
Warren Lee) physicalized cycles of dependency and aggression keyed to the 
abrupt mood changes in a tape collage of music by John Zorn. 
</P>
<P>
A program note mentioned the work's origins in a novel about "the effects of 
colonialism on traditional Nigerian society," but the work aimed for a 
dreamlike diffusion of image, incident and emotion, with its scrim lighting 
effects, billowing smoke and mysterious visitations by a ghostly Marina 
Panossian. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the dream ended prematurely on Thursday, with the smoke 
inundating the theater, causing some audience members to move away from the 
stage, others to go home and still more to gamely cough through the end of 
</P>
<P>
the work. But, obviously the piece's atmosphere and cumulative impact had been 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The celebratory crowd-pleaser of the program came from Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's 
New York-based Urban Bush Women. Titled "I Don't Know, but I've Been Told if 
You Keep on Dancin' You'll Never Grow Old," it took ideas from American 
streets, schoolyards and stadiums, turning them into irrepressible group 
routines set to live vocal and percussion accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes this tribute to "people who keep the spirit of dance alive all over 
the world" (Zollar's words) merely looked like funky aerobics but other 
passages offered witty expansions of sports-movement or cheerleading ritual 
into dancing. However, the hyperkinetic seven-woman company proved consistently 
eclipsed by the resident music man, David Pleasant. Not only could he drum, 
sing, and play the harmonica, Pleasant launched a bravura patting-Juba display 
that left much of the audience deliriously slap-happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" continues tonight with 
works by Lula Washington, Donald Byrd, L. Martina Young and Alonzo King. The 
Sun. program is identical, except that a duet by Jones replaces Young's solo.

FOLK BALLET OF YUGOSLAVIA AT UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES

<TEXT>
<P>
If all had gone as planned, the Doina Romanian Folk Ballet would have danced 
Thursday at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine. But that company was not 
permitted by the Romanian government to leave its homeland, according to Bren 
Center officials. So the National Folk Ballet of Yugoslavia was booked in its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
No need to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs brought an engaging, varied program that ranged from lighthearted 
social vignettes to works of genuine mythic depth and power, and they danced it 
with freshness, sweetness, eagerness and skill. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Markovich, principal choreographer for the company, crafted a clever 
piece to introduce his brilliantly costumed company, and to assert -- according 
to the printed program -- the "unity and fraternity of all the Yugoslavian 
people." 
</P>
<P>
It also previewed, among its fluidly forming and dissolving circular patterns, 
many of the signature motifs to be seen later in individual regional dances. 
</P>
<P>
Here were the upraised, goal-post arms in the Montenegrin dance; the women and 
men twirling together in the Dalmatian "Linjo"; the quick gliding, toe-slapping 
steps in the dances from Posavina; the high-held bent-leg kick that recurred 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition to the social and recreational pieces, two works stood out for 
historic resonance. 
</P>
<P>
One was the noble, heroic Montenegrin dance, in which the men thrust their arms 
in battle poses (to "Sacre"-like rhythms) or practiced knife fights while the 
women applauded encouragingly, hands above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
But the real knock-out was a line dance for men from Macedonia. Here, the 
dancers revealed a dignity, seriousness, weight and power that showed us that 
folk traditions remain viable not because they entertain tourists, foreigners 
or even a country's own people, but because they connect to deep needs and 
memories that transcend individual cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the dancers were accompanied by a nine-member band that played with 
virtuosity and appealing gentleness. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Slavko Antovich proved a powerhouse drummer, threading himself 
among the dancers. Tanya Obrenovich was the throaty soloist in Gypsy songs. 
</P>
<P>
The company will appear tonight at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. CHRIS

LECH WALESA ON 'NEWSMAKER SATURDAY'; 'TILL WE MEET AGAIN' SWEEPS IN ON CBS

As usual during those infamous ratings sweeps, it is the best of times and the 
worst of times on television this weekend. While Lech Walesa visits the United 
States, the three major networks and PBS trot out some of their heaviest 
ammunition in the battle for ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa will appear with CNN journalists Charles Bierbauer and Ralph Begleiter 
on "Newsmaker Saturday" today at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Meanwhile, "Sunday 
Morning" reports on Walesa's life history and his U.S. visit on Sunday at 8 
a.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at 9 p.m., CBS (2)(8) unveils the first installment of a five-hour 
miniseries based on Judith Krantz's novel "Till We Meet Again." NBC (4)(36)(39) 
counters with Raymond Burr again starring as the unbeatable attorney in "Perry 
Mason: The Case of the All-Star Assassin." And ABC (7)(3)(10)(42) plays it safe 
with Bette Midler and Shelley Long in the 1987 feature "Outrageous Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the weekend's best bet, however, is the first of "Masterpiece 
Theatre's" new, four-part adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two 
Cities," Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channel 28 and 15, 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24.

The docents at the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom at Franklin Canyon 
Ranch say fall is the perfect time to be in the canyon. Fallen sycamore leaves 
are a foot and a half deep in many places. Seeds and cones have dropped to the 
ground, and animals are scurrying about to harvest them. 
</P>
<P>
Families can soak up all this autumnal ambiance Sunday afternoon when the 
classroom and many of its docents will host a family walk followed by a 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
The walks begin at 1 p.m. with no more than 20 to a group. The route is the 
same for all groups -- around the lake -- but families will be arranged 
according to the age of their children. The walk is suitable for children 2 
through 12, and is stroller accessible. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m., as walkers return to the center, ethnomusicologist Craig Woodson 
will entertain in the auditorium. In his hour show, Woodson will talk about and 
play traditional instruments from Africa, Europe and the Americas. Children 
will be invited to join him on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The walk and concert are free, but reservations are recommended. Both take 
place at WODOC's Sooky Goldman Nature Center, 2600 Franklin Canyon Drive, 
Beverly Hills.

TEDDY BEAR TALES 
</P>
<P>
A story time featuring tales of teddy bears will honor Michael Hague, 
illustrator of children's books including "The Velveteen Rabbit" and "Mother 
Goose." Hague is the artist behind the book illustrations attributed to the 
character Nancy in TV's "thirtysomething." (Hague had been scheduled to appear, 
but will not because of a recent injury.) The story time will begin at 10 a.m. 
today at Pages Books for Children, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana.

A GALLERY OF CRAVEN IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horror director Wes Craven can remember when people got up and left dinner 
parties after learning who he was. After all, he was someone who made movies 
with titles like "Swamp Thing," "Invitation to Hell" and "Nightmare on Elm 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
But the former college professor would tell anyone who stayed to listen that he 
really stumbled onto horror as the genre of opportunity and personally abhorred 
violence and gratuitous blood-letting. What interested him were myths and 
dreams. He had always wanted to do more than scare people. 
</P>
<P>
Craven's new film "Shocker," a fable about a murderous TV repairman who is put 
to death in the electric chair only to be transformed by the voltage into 
something more terrifying, will hardly be mistaken for a romantic comedy, but 
neither is it as gruesome or simple-minded as the plot outline might suggest. 
To hear Craven talk about it, the film sounds scripted for a social studies 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a fantasy, but it has to do with my take on evil," he said. 
"That if you use an essentially brutal device to end something, you're simply 
perpetuating it." 
</P>
<P>
Horace Pinker, the villain of "Shocker," played by Mitch Pileggi, manages, 
through a pact with the devil, to transmogrify himself into an electric current 
so that he eventually is able to come into homes through their television sets, 
entering and possessing his victims at will. "It's a simple paradigm of the way 
evil can mutate and move through a culture, starting with a specific act and 
then entering the media," the director said. "Now, I'm not going to say that to 
the kids, but they know it's true. They recognize it when they see it." 
</P>
<P>
Craven, who it might be said looks nothing like the sound of his name, was born 
in 1939 in Cleveland and grew up in a fundamentalist home where movies of any 
kind were considered invitations to hell. Tall, open-faced and dressed 
Hollywood hip on a recent morning in Universal City, he said he is not at all 
uncomfortable working in a genre whose audience is composed largely of 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a natural affinity for teen-agers probably because I'm arrested in 
maturity myself. I've had kids, I've taught kids. Also over the 20 years that 
I've been making films, a generation has grown up that recognizes they're more 
than slash-and-burn films." 
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said for certain members of his family, notably his mother, 
who to this day has never seen one of his movies. "She's never been in a 
theater," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he began writing screenplays on the East Coast in the late 1960s, after 
suddenly quitting the academic world he had trained for at Johns Hopkins 
University, Craven fell back on the stories he knew best as a professor: the 
Greek myths. He found the Greek myths to be more than serviceable as models for 
horror films. 
</P>
<P>
"That is essentially what they were: the horror films of their time. Odysseus 
goes into the cave and meets the Cyclops, Charybdis and all these monstrous 
things that represent elements of human experience, the descent into hell and 
coming back out. You just deal with those very primal, very basic human 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable thing about horror films is you can do anything you want with 
that format, from making a piece of crud to making something that can express a 
profound element of your world view. They are one of the modern myths, sort of 
like Joseph Campbell on acid." 
</P>
<P>
The world view offered in "Shocker" seems to have something to do with the 
insidious power of television, although the director, who also wrote the 
screenplay, insists this line of reasoning not be taken too far. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply pointing out that television is a very powerful, omnipresent force 
in our lives. It is in a sense the cerebral network that is developing over the 
the surface of the planet as a manifestation of the next evolutionary step up 
in human intelligence. You can't say it's just a set, it's just the tube. It's 
a major event in human consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is the power of dreams and our inadequate understanding of them that 
seems most to have preoccupied Craven throughout his 10 films, the best known 
example being his "Nightmare on Elm Street," the popular 1985 thriller about a 
putrefying zombie who stalks teen-age girls through their dreams. The film 
introduced the character Freddy Krueger (along with his scalpel-bladed fingers) 
to the front ranks of horror heavies. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario for "Nightmare" came to Craven after reading a series of news 
stories about the mysterious deaths of several Southeast Asian immigrants, all 
boys, in Orange County. The boys each reported experiencing nightmares so 
terrifying they couldn't tell their parents or friends about them. Neither 
could they sleep, but eventually when each boy finally did go to sleep, he died 
-- with no clear physiological explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the idea that the killer exists only in their nightmares. If they're 
awake, they're safe, but if they sleep, they enter his world, and he kills them 
in the dream. But they also die in real life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of Horace Pinker or Freddy Krueger as real people. They are 
elements of the human psyche, and that's what frightens me." 
</P>
<P>
Craven does not think of himself as the "Guru of Gore," as he has occasionally 
been called. He believes he is "careful" about violence in his films. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to depict it as real," he said, "but I also try to show that violence is 
not a viable solution. My films are basically about survival rather than 
vanquishing." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most alarming sequences in "Shocker" -- the scene he feels is the 
most effective in the film -- is one in which Pileggi, as Pinker, bites off a 
prison guard's fingers just before he is to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"Not because it was blood and guts and entrails everywhere, which it wasn't. It 
was just the animal ferocity of it. That's hard to come up with and hard to 
contain in your own mind. Because it is a real force, and you can feel it when 
you're doing those scenes on the set. People get giddy or they get silent. 
Because it's not a comfortable thing to be dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
And Craven looks to "a film like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Its very title 
reeks of exploitation and tawdriness. But the energy level attained in that 
film is incredible. And in a sense the sort of ferocious honesty of it is 
unapproached. When I watched it I was absolutely appalled and afraid. I felt 
like (director Tobe Hooper) was insane. I know when people watch my films they 
think the same thing."

THE SENSUOUS LAMBADA: BLAME IT ON RIO; 
</P>
<P>
TREND: THE DANCE ORIGINATED IN BRAZIL BUT IS JUST NOW ARRIVING HERE FROM 
EUROPE. IT IS A CLOSE-CONTACT AFFAIR NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get ready for the lambada. What? You haven't heard of it? You will. 
</P>
<P>
Described by many observers as "Dirty Dancing" with a Latin beat, lambada 
brings couple dancing back with a vengeance. Performed in body-to-body close 
contact, it is not an activity for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
The sensual Brazilian dance that swept across Europe last summer is now hitting 
the United States. Lambada dances have already sprung up in New York, and 
separate dance programs are planned for tonight at the Second Coming in 
downtown Los Angeles and at Samba e Saudade, a Culver City dance club. CBS is 
preparing to release a lambada single next week by the group that launched the 
craze in Europe, and the record company plans an album next month. And some 
other Southern California clubs are gearing up for steamy lambada nights in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine asking someone to dance," said KCRW-FM's music director, Tom Schnabel, 
a reliable weather vane for musical trends, "and then putting yourself 
pelvis-to-pelvis with this stranger and starting to move. I think I'd pass out 
on the dance floor!" 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Dowling, whose Warner Dance Center West in Canoga Park was the first 
area dance studio to offer lambada lessons, described it in even more succinct 
terms: "It's done with a lot of fun, and no one really takes it very seriously, 
but it can literally be like having sex with your clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
A lambada starts out innocently enough, with the couple in traditional partner 
dance position. The thighs and pelvis, however, are virtually glued together. 
As the music, which can range from medium to fast, continues, it energizes the 
dance into rotating hip movements -- call it a grind. The momentum builds, and 
the dancers move into improvised dips and swirls. But the body contact, with 
its rhythmically erotic circling of the hips, is continuous, an essential 
characteristic of the dance. 
</P>
<P>
The lambada exploded on the European music scene earlier this year, initially 
via a French orange drink commercial, which led to the release in Europe of the 
single "Lambada" by the Brazilian group Kaoma. The record, scheduled for 
release in this country next week, has already sold more than 4 million copies 
in Europe, and has topped Billboard's Pan-European charts for months. 
</P>
<P>
But the lambada is not a new dance. Its history traces back five decades. A 
blend of meringue, salsa and samba, the lambada emerged from the 
African-influenced music of Brazil's northeastern states to become enormously 
popular in Rio de Janeiro in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Like the tango in Argentina, the lambada sizzled with eroticism. Unlike the 
tango, its sensuality was direct and to-the-point. 
</P>
<P>
When Getulio Vargas, then-dictator of Brazil, saw the dance, he was horrified 
by its "immorality" and ordered it banned from his "disciplined democracy." 
</P>
<P>
But the lambada lived on in the sertao, the northern countryside, adding a 
Caribbean influence here and there until it emerged once again in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Yudin, a UCLA dance ethnologist and one of the directors of a dance group 
called Soul of Brazil, compares it to social dances from Cape Verdes and 
Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
"Its name," she explained, "traces to porrada, a slang word, which means a hit 
or a slap. And, in terms of the dance, it makes sense, since the whole focus is 
for the dancing pair to jam their thighs and their sexual organs against each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Dance Center West's Dowling remembers seeing the dance when she was living in 
Brazil in the mid-'60s. "It was very much the same dance as now," she recalled. 
"The only real difference is in the way the dancers dress. It was fairly 
conservative in the '60s, while today, the girls like to wear short little 
ruffled skirts, and the men are often shirtless, with a headband, and maybe a 
wrist band. Another difference is the fact that today's lambada is usually done 
barefoot. But it was just as erotic in the '60s as it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Kleber Jorge, perhaps the Southland's best expatriate Brazilian musician, 
recalls playing lambada music for dances more than a decade ago. Like Yudin, he 
described it as a kind of musical stew, well-seasoned with Caribbean and 
African influences. 
</P>
<P>
The original lambada, he explained, "had a real Brazilian feeling. But now, it 
sounds more like meringue, with much more of a Caribbean feeling. And I think 
that's what happened to it when it went to Europe. They mixed in other things 
to make it commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not a very interesting music to perform. It's like the polka. If you 
ask a musician to play a polka, he might enjoy it once or twice, but not for a 
whole night. The lambada is real dance music, like disco, not music for 
musicians to use for creative playing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jorge, recognizing the prevailing winds, is adding several lambada 
pieces to his group's repertoire. In the works are upcoming performances of 
authentic lambada with Yudin's Soul of Brazil dance company. 
</P>
<P>
The full impact of lambada, however, will begin to be felt in the next month. 
CBS's release of the Kaoma single will be followed by an album in December, as 
well as a two-disc compilation of Brazilian lambada groups early next year. 
Kaoma, along with a large dance group, is scheduled to appear at the Palace in 
Hollywood in the first week in December. 
</P>
<P>
More immediately, a dance tonight, at The Second Coming in downtown Los 
Angeles, will feature Afro-Brazil, a company of musicians and dancers, in a 
full-fledged lambada program that will include demonstrations and instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Samba e Saudade, the pet Brazilian music project of promoter Maria Lucien, will 
showcase a lambada dance contest tonight during its weekly program in Culver 
City. "This will be the third week that we've done the contest," she explained, 
"and it's the most successful thing we've ever done. I love the lambada. It's 
so sweet, so exciting, and it's already happened in Europe. So now it's time 
for it to happen here. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can dance the lambada without getting too close. It doesn't have to be 
completely erotic. Of course, it's more fun if it is!" 
</P>
<P>
Other clubs, among them Nucleus Nuance and Music Machine, are planning lambada 
events and the Red Onion, in Woodland Hills, will present Felix Chavez, of the 
Warner Dance Center West, in a teaching session Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
But does the lambada, so to speak, have legs? Will it be more than another 
15-minute novelty? 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Lestinge, a Brazilian television commentator and the host of a KCRW's 
Brazilian music show, has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"The dance may be old," he said, "but quality-wise and artist-wise it's quite 
new. In many ways it's still in the folk realm of music -- very innocent, very 
naive. But everybody sees its commercial potential and there are a lot of 
battles raging right now over the rights to it -- especially so since everyone 
realizes how important the American market could be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rooting for the lambada," Lestinge continued. "But I'd also like to see 
Brazilian artists like Milton Nascimento and Caetano Veloso, who are incredible 
talents, become more successful too. And, who knows, if lambada is successful 
it may finally be the big hit that will help all the Brazilian performers." 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure. The lambada has to be experienced to be understood. It is 
not a music for passive listening. 
</P>
<P>
As KCRW's Schnabel put it: "Lambada feels good. It has nice beat, and it's a 
pleasurable music. Maybe the best part of it is that it's beyond intellectual. 
It just makes you feel like moving." 
</P>

RICK DU BROW: A DRY, TRITE SEASON THREATENS NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

<TEXT>
<P>
The good news is that Vincent is back. When CBS announced Thursday that the 
noble man-creature would return Dec. 12 in "Beauty and the Beast," thousands of 
viewers who wrote the network protesting the dropping of the show from the fall 
schedule must have felt a satisfying surge of power. 
</P>
<P>
Any network that offers Candice Bergen in "Murphy Brown" and Ron Perlman as the 
literate, romantic "beast" named Vincent can't be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
But then there is the bad news. The Mad Hatter seems to be taking part in 
program decisions at CBS, and maybe all of the Big Three networks should seek 
out a quiet weekend retreat where their executives can contemplate the nature 
of the universe, the meaning of it all and whether they'd like to stay in 
business. It's not certain anymore, you know, in the new world of TV 
alternatives, especially after disasters like this fall's network season. 
</P>
<P>
Back to CBS. There was no surprise in Thursday's cancellation of "Peaceable 
Kingdom," which stars Lindsay Wagner as a zoo director. It was stillborn and 
disappears Dec. 6. Nor was it shocking that another lemon, "Island Son," in 
which Richard Chamberlain plays a doctor, was yanked so that CBS could 
reschedule it. But now hear this: 
</P>
<P>
Just days ago, CBS gave "Wolf," a detective show with Jack Scalia, a 
full-season pickup. Yet suddenly, the network has put the show "on hiatus" -- 
it finished 79th in this week's ratings and drew only 9% of the national 
viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
All right, anybody can make a mistake. But as this month's key ratings sweeps 
head for the finish line Nov. 29, the new TV season is adding up to one big 
mistake -- a succession of flops that seems to have long-range implications 
about the ability of the Big Three to hold their fast-declining audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Who would think, for instance, that top-ranked NBC, the 800-pound gorilla of 
network TV, would be running scared? Well, it certainly seems to be. NBC went 
0-for-5 in the ratings with its new series this fall, including the sitcoms 
"Sister Kate" and "The Nutt House." It's the worst start for new NBC series 
since 1983, when the network's freshman shows went 0-for-9. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference is that NBC was gambling back then, driving for the top. 
Consider how a flop like the Steven Bochco drama "Bay City Blues" now seems way 
ahead of its time with its baseball setting that's been turned to great success 
in motion pictures such as "Field of Dreams" and "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, NBC played it safe this fall with its new series, which also 
included the cop shows "Hardball" and "Mancuso FBI" and the lifeguard tale 
"Baywatch." But why should the powerful No. 1 network run scared? Could it be 
because it knows its owner, General Electric, doesn't have the same tolerance 
for failure as its former parent company, RCA, and wouldn't hesitate to sell 
off the network if it slipped to the bottom of the ratings? 
</P>
<P>
But playing it safe is dangerous strategy for NBC. Some of the hits that have 
carried the network through the decade -- such as "Cheers" and "The Cosby Show" 
-- are aging, if still powerful. They won't be around forever, and the network 
has to develop other blockbusters to compete in the new era of TV. 
</P>
<P>
Winning against just CBS and ABC isn't where it's at anymore. The enemy now is 
VCRs, cable and independent stations, and in that sense NBC's all-powerful 
status may be more precarious than imagined. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is surely no threat to NBC or anybody, except itself. Once the proud king 
of the airwaves -- home of "All in the Family," "MASH," "The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show" and "I Love Lucy" -- CBS has a hard time doing things right these days. 
"Murphy Brown" has very nearly saved the network's reputation as a creative 
entity, and there are a few continuing hits such as "60 Minutes" and "Murder, 
She Wrote." But that's just about all she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
No new CBS series this season has really worked out as hoped. The network's big 
experiment -- six consecutive sitcoms on Monday, backed by enormous promotion 
-- has yielded disappointing ratings. The critical lead-off show, "Major Dad," 
could do no better than 36th place in the latest national rankings. Another 
touted new Monday sitcom, "The Famous Teddy Z," has failed to excite the 
nation. Even "Murphy Brown," the centerpiece of the six-sitcom lineup, has a 
struggle on its hands -- it came in 35th last week. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the aging of CBS' one-time backbone -- soaps such as "Dallas" (40th 
last week) and "Falcon Crest" (54th). And add to that the fact that CBS 
traditionally has the grass-roots audience, but 45% of television's viewers now 
are concentrated in the 23 major urban markets as measured by the Nielsen 
ratings -- with Tampa, Fla., and Cincinnati joining the list a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, meanwhile, is an interesting case. Although second in the ratings, it 
seems more secure than first-place NBC -- possibly because it is the only 
network still owned by a broadcaster, Capital Cities Communications, and also 
because billionaire Warren Buffett has pledged his voting stock to the company, 
even if he should die. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of security may well be a subtle factor in ABC's notably unique 
series during the last few seasons -- by far the most original new shows on any 
network: "The Wonder Years," "thirtysomething," "China Beach," "Moonlighting," 
"Roseanne" and "Life Goes On." 
</P>
<P>
This season, ABC is within striking distance of NBC in the ratings. And if 
ABC's two planned prime-time series starring Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Ruth catch 
on, the network could make a real run for the top spot within several years. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, meanwhile, has series with Alan Alda and Carol Burnett in the works, and 
it definitely needs another breakout hit like "L.A. Law" or "The Golden Girls" 
to regenerate itself creatively. 
</P>
<P>
It's later than the networks think. A few more barren new seasons like the 
current one and the images that CBS, NBC and ABC built in TV's first 50 years 
will fade away and become irrelevant. That was then and this is now.

THE EAST MOJAVE: A RARE JEWEL; 
</P>
<P>
OUTDOORS: A FEW HOURS FROM LOS ANGELES IS AN UNDISCOVERED GEM, THE 'LONESOME 
TRIANGLE,' BOUNDED BY HIGHWAYS. THE LAND IS EASY TO LIKE, BUT HARD TO GET TO 
KNOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE, Rae is the author of the just-published East Mojave Desert: A 
Visitor's Guide (Olympus Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a few hours from Los Angeles is a virtually undiscovered gem of the 
desert, sometimes referred to as "The Lonesome Triangle." 
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 million acres within that triangle, bounded by Interstate 15 on the 
north and Interstate 40 to the south, Barstow on the west and Needles on the 
east, is the East Mojave National Scenic Area. It's a land of great diversity 
-- of grand mesas and mountain ranges, sand dunes and extinct volcanoes. It's a 
land that's easy to like, hard to know. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the East Mojave has frequently been in the news during 
controversies over mining and off-road vehicle use. And it's in the news now 
because a provision of the California Desert Protection Act before Congress 
that calls for transferring administration of the area from the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) to the National Park Service and renaming it Mojave National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
How best to protect this area will be debated for years to come. But for now, 
at least, visitors who venture into the East Mojave will discover a desert like 
no other. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau has begun to realize its role in making the area more accessible. 
The agency has upgraded campgrounds, increased ranger patrols and installed 
some new interpretive displays; it is also creating a few hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you're a bird watcher or a bicyclist, photographer or rock hound, 
amateur astronomer or all-star at relaxing outdoors, if you're longing for 
wide-open spaces away from it all, head to what's often called the crown jewel 
of the California desert. Autumn is a perfect time to explore the heart of the 
Mojave, the East Mojave National Scenic Area. 
</P>
<P>
An introductory tour of the East Mojave takes in its most popular sites: Kelso 
Depot and Kelso Dunes; the newly designated Back Country Byway along Black 
Canyon Road, and the campgrounds at Hole-in-the-Wall and Mid-Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the scenic area are available at the California Desert 
Information Center in Barstow (see end of story). 
</P>
<P>
Once you sample these destinations, you're likely to return again and again to 
discover more. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style depot was built by Union Pacific in 1924. This distinctive 
50-by-150-foot, two-story wooden structure was designed with a red-tiled roof, 
graceful arches and a red brick platform. It featured several small rooms that 
provided overnight accommodations for railroad employees, a telegraph office, a 
restaurant nicknamed the Beanery and a waiting room for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The depot stayed open through the mid-1980s, although it ceased to be a 
railroad stop for passengers after World War II. Visitors picnicked on the 
lawn, dined at the restaurant and generally enjoyed the Mediterranean ambiance 
of the charming building. When Union Pacific officials decided to demolish the 
historical building in 1985, local citizens, government officials, 
environmentalists and a host of others formed a coalition to fight the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The group, known as the Kelso Depot Fund, saved the depot and continues to work 
for its preservation and restoration. The depot may one day be used as a 
visitor information center for the East Mojave. Other plans include opening it 
as a restaurant, a conference center or railroad museum. 
</P>
<P>
Migratory birds stop here because of the water; the manicured lawn and 
cottonwood trees provide an oasis-like feeling. 
</P>
<P>
And the historic architecture lends elegance to the once-again tiny town of 
Kelso with a population of two dozen. Freight and passenger trains still rumble 
through town, but they no longer stop there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kelso Dunes 
</P>
<P>
Take Kelbaker Road seven miles from Kelso Depot to a signed dirt road and turn 
west. Drive three miles to the BLM parking area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more spectacular sights in the East Mojave is Kelso Dunes. This 
45-square-mile formation of magnificently sculpted sand dunes is the most 
extensive dune field in the West. Some dunes tower higher than 700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Kelso Dunes are called "booming dunes" for the low vibrational sounds that are 
created when the sand, made of polished grains of quartz, slides over the 
underlying surface. The low rumbling has been compared to the sound of a chorus 
or of a kettle drum. 
</P>
<P>
The Kelso Dunes have been closed to off-road vehicles since 1973, so they've 
been relatively protected from the kind of damage that has reduced some of 
California's dune formations to barren piles of sand. More than 100 varieties 
of plants live on or near the dunes, including sand verbena, desert primrose, 
mesquite, creosote and native grasses. Dune-dwelling animals include several 
species of birds, rodents, sidewinders, lizards and kit foxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Kelso Dunes provide a fine vantage point from which to see the East Mojave. 
But getting to the top of the shifting sands requires some hard work. Take your 
time and enjoy the experience; it's not every day you get to play in a giant 
sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hole-in-the-Wall 
</P>
<P>
Although the location of the small campground is pleasant enough to attract 
campers, bird watchers and others who just want to stay put, more adventurous 
types find the highlight of a trip to Hole-in-the-Wall is exploring the 
volcanic formation that forms its backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Hole-in-the-Wall is the kind of place Butch Cassidy and his gang might have 
used as a hide-out. Hikers once used ropes and ladders to descend into Banshee 
Canyon from the campground; today you can use two sets of iron rings set into 
the rock. Maneuvering through the rings is not particularly difficult for those 
who are reasonably agile and take their time. Acrophobes or claustrophobes may 
want to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoy exploring the volcanic rock formations known as rhyolite, a crystallized 
form of lava. The holes provide frames for taking silly photographs of your 
companions. This is a place where you can easily laze away an afternoon, gazing 
into the sky at the circling raptors; golden eagles, hawks and owls are 
frequently spotted here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wildhorse Canyon 
</P>
<P>
In July, Wildhorse Canyon Road, which loops from Hole-in-the-Wall campground to 
Mid-Hills campground, was declared the nation's first official Back Country 
Byway by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at Hole-in-the-Wall, the 11-mile horseshoe-shaped road crosses 
wide-open country dotted with cholla and (in season) delicate purple, yellow, 
white and red wildflowers. Dramatic volcanic slopes and flat-top mesas tower 
over this low desert. 
</P>
<P>
This is open country, reminiscent of the Old West, complete with barbed-wire 
fences, sagebrush, range cattle, windmills and views that go on forever. 
Proceeding northward on the road, you encounter a landscape of sagebrush, then 
a pinyon-juniper woodland. 
</P>
<P>
The road takes travelers from the 3,500-foot level at Hole-in-the-Wall to 
mile-high Mid-Hills. Watch how the scenery changes with the elevation. If 
you're very lucky, you'll spot deer or even a bighorn sheep on the rocky 
slopes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-Hills Campground 
</P>
<P>
This isolated campground's location appeals to those wanting to get away from 
it all. It's easy to reach, but feels as if it's miles from nowhere, with more 
than two dozen well-spaced campsites. At the north end of the campground, 
looking northwest, is the East Mojave's best view of Cima Dome, the 
75-square-mile formation of uplifted once-molten rock. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most intriguing aspects of the Mid-Hills area is the dominant plant 
life -- the pinyon pine-juniper forest. During Pleistocene times, a few hundred 
thousand years ago, these cone-bearing trees flourished throughout the Mojave. 
As the weather became more arid, the range of these trees was restricted to 
higher elevations, which provided sufficient precipitation for their growth. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, fragrant pines that are so prominent in this area were once an 
important food source. At this time of year, when the nuts would ripen and 
become plentiful, the Chemehuevi, Piute and other native people traveled to the 
higher elevations of the desert to collect pine nuts, an important staple in 
their diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

FRENCH ROLL TENSE GAME OF STEELY CONCENTRATION; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THE GALLIC PASSION FOR PETANQUE, A FORM OF BOWLING PLAYED OUTDOORS 
WITH THREE METAL BALLS, HAS BEEN IMPORTED TO WEST LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB HOWELLS, Howells is a free-lance writer who lives in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's arguably the national pastime of France. Wherever there's a patch of flat 
dirt -- in town squares, boulevard meridians, public parks, campgrounds -- 
petanque players gather. 
</P>
<P>
All they're really doing is trying to toss or roll three steel balls as close 
to a marker as possible. But that process brings out at least as much passion, 
strategy, animated gesturing, spirited banter and joie de vivre among the 
French as do politics or haute cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that French "petanquers" living in Los Angeles have staked 
out a patch of Southern California dirt to carry on their passion. They gather 
every Saturday and occasional Sundays in Rancho Park in West Los Angeles, 
transforming a niche of the park -- tucked between the archery range and a 
maintenance shed -- into a parcel of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
But the mostly French contingent that gathers in Rancho Park isn't there to 
indulge in nostalgia for their country. They're there to play petanque. 
</P>
<P>
Pronounced "pay-tonk" (and also known as boules -- pronounced "bools"), the 
game is similar to shuffleboard or horseshoes, and related to, but not the same 
as, English lawn bowling or Italian boccie ball. 
</P>
<P>
A small round marker called a cochonnet, or jack, is tossed six to 10 meters 
away. Players then take turns tossing three steel boules as close as possible 
to the jack. The object is to finish a round with all three of one's balls 
closer to the jack than any of the opponents' balls. The game can be played 
tete-a-tete, or with teams of two or three. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound rather tame, but when strategy kicks in, the game shifts into 
high gear. For example, in three-on-three petanque, each player assumes a 
specialist role. The first player, called the pointeur, uses a deft backhand 
toss to place his or her ball close to the cochonnet. Backspin prevents the 
ball from rolling too far. 
</P>
<P>
The second player, the milieur, may attempt to better the opponents' position 
relative to the jack, or may elect to bump a boule out of scoring contention. 
The third player is the tireur, the marksman, who specializes in bumping 
opponents' balls. 
</P>
<P>
The tireur's ability usually makes the difference in a petanque match. Even a 
casual onlooker can marvel at the skill of a good tireur as he concentrates on 
a target -- an enemy boule lying close to the jack -- then launches a toss high 
in the air. Steel on steel produces a loud clink as the target boule ricochets 
away. The tireur's own boule may plop right down in place of the other. Even if 
it doesn't, he has cleared the way for his team to score. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a round, only the team with the boule closest to the jack scores. 
A measurement may be required. If the two closest boules belong to the same 
team, two points are scored, and if the three closest are of the same team, the 
maximum three points are scored. A full game may go to 15, or any predetermined 
number. 
</P>
<P>
The petanquers who gather in Rancho Park are passionate about their sport, but 
they are just as enthusiastic about sharing it. One needn't be daunted by all 
the French banter that accompanies petanque matches. The players all shift 
quickly into English when visitors inquire about the game. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Breidenstein, president of the Los Angeles Petanque Club, says the group 
is trying to encourage Americans to play, so as to further the growth of the 
sport here. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes on a Sunday when we have a tournament, we get pretty serious, but 
Saturdays are for training, for fun," he said. "We always have extra balls and 
we always welcome visitors." 
</P>
<P>
Petanque clubs have formed in San Francisco and San Diego also, as well as in 
most major cities across the country. According to Breidenstein, about 500 
players are registered with the Federation of Petanque, USA, and hundreds more 
play the game casually. Most are French, but the Los Angeles club also has 
members from Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Canada and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The representation reflects the worldwide growth of the sport, which was played 
almost exclusively in the South of France until after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 countries were represented at last month's world championship in 
Spain, and prospects are good for petanque becoming a demonstration sport in 
the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
American petanque gained international prestige during the world tournament; a 
U.S. team that included two Los Angeles players finished 27th among 54 teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can play petanque," says petanquer Max Le Grand. "That's part of the 
beauty of the sport. Women, children, older people -- it's not strenuous, and 
it's easy to learn." 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a lot more going on than meets the eye," adds Pierre Agnesse, a 
deadly tireur and member of the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
What clearly meets the eye of the petanque spectator is the camaraderie among 
the players. The game is clearly as much social as it is sport. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Sunday tournament that included San Francisco's top team (which, 
incidentally, only narrowly defeated a team of Los Angeles women), picnic 
tables next to the courts were laden with pastries, baguette sandwiches and 
beverages. Nearly as much eating and socializing went on as petanque playing. 
And visitors were given a hearty bienvenue. 
</P>
<P>
 (Members of the Los Angeles Petanque Club gather in Rancho Park, near Motor 
Avenue and Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles, every Saturday from about 10 
a.m. until dark. The next Sunday tournament will be December 3.)

THIRD ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE OF HERBAL DELIGHTS 
</P>

<P>
If you are a herb fancier, a crafts lover, an avid gardener, a gourmet or a 
Christmas shopper, you will appreciate today's Harvest Herb Faire sponsored by 
the Inland Herb Society. 
</P>
<P>
This is the society's third annual Harvest Herb Faire and promises to be its 
best. Held in Woodcrest, a suburb of Riverside, the fair begins at 9 a.m. and 
lasts until dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the assortment of activities and eating and shopping opportunities the 
fair offers: 
</P>
<P>
There will be lectures, workshops and demonstrations by experts. Included are 
herb-craft workshops, basket-making, spinning and weaving demonstrations and a 
lecture tour of an extensive herb garden. You can learn when and how to plant 
herbs and all about their culinary uses. 
</P>
<P>
Fair-goers will find herbal culinary delights at the various food booths. 
Herbal crafts will be on display and for sale, as will herb plants and cut 
herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Crafts play a large role in the fair, in demonstrations and as sale items, and 
the accent here is on holiday crafts and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Herbal craft designer Barbara Sausser will offer a wide selection of Christmas 
wreaths, potpourri and other crafts and will answer questions about craft 
design using herbs and flowers. Sausser says herbal wreaths offer a great 
advantage over other floral wreaths. Plain floral wreaths may be beautiful, but 
herbal floral wreaths are also fragrant. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the crafts, you will encounter a bit of herbal Christmas lore. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, do you know what frankincense and myrrh are? They are aromatic 
resins from trees found in Arabia. Historically, they have been used in making 
incense and perfume. Sausser will have some frankincense and myrrh on display; 
she uses both as fixatives in herbal potpourri. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Sausser said the reason many commercial potpourris lose their 
fragrance quickly is that they are often treated with an oil to establish the 
scent, and the scent soon fades. Natural potpourri is a blend of scented 
ingredients of herbs and flowers and includes a fixative (material that absorbs 
and holds scents). A natural potpourri will retain its fragrance for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In Sausser's craft area, view the magnificent herbal Christmas tree she has 
created. You may also want to purchase a miniature Christmas tree constructed 
from rosemary, a traditional Christmas herb. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Waddell, Inland Herb Society president and a renowned herb expert, will 
conduct regular tours of the herb garden. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Waddell to show you the Mexican bush sage, an ideal landscape plant for 
Southland yards. It bears purple flowers that bloom all winter and attract 
hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
The garden contains many traditional culinary, ornamental and medicinal herbs, 
along with unusual specimens. Consider costmary, also known as the Bible herb 
because in early days churchgoers would use its broad leaves as bookmarks. In 
addition, they nibbled on the leaves -- which have a startling bitter-mint 
flavor -- to keep awake during sermons. 
</P>
<P>
After your tour, you can buy an herb plant or two for garden or container. Fall 
is an especially good time to plant perennial herbs. Herb expert Bill Jenks 
will offer free planting advice at the plant booth. 
</P>
<P>
You needn't leave the Harvest Herb Faire hungry. Under the directorship of food 
specialist and master gardener Tracy Di Napoli, delicious homemade herbal 
goodies will be for sale. Consider some of the culinary choices: baked herbal 
chicken; herb-vegetable soups; herbal biscuits; herbal dips; persimmon and 
lemon tea breads; thyme, anise and persimmon cookies; pumpkin pie; spiced hot 
cider and herbal teas. 
</P>
<P>
A don't-miss in the food section is Auntie M's fantastic salad and produce 
booth. Auntie M (Marcella Waggoner) is famous for her gourmet salads, which 
feature salad greens, exotic herbs and flowers, and are topped off with her 
herbal vinegar dressings. She sells them throughout the Inland Empire at 
certified farmers' markets. Auntie M is an Herb Society member, and she will 
share culinary secrets with you. In fact, member-vendors throughout the food 
section will share recipes with you. 
</P>
<P>
Before you leave the fair, watch expert basket maker Mary Ann Logan work her 
magic, and catch the weaving and spinning demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The herb fair originated because two society members, Donna Metcalfe and 
Barbara Sausser, longed for a country herb fair like the ones common in the 
East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvest Herb Faire is at Sausser's herb garden in the midst of a Christmas 
tree farm, 15665 Russell St., Woodcrest area (just outside Riverside). 
</P>
<P>
Take California 91 to Van Buren Boulevard in Riverside. Go east about eight 
miles on Van Buren. When you cross the signal at Washington Street, look for 
Herb Faire signs. Turn north on Ridgeway Avenue, east on Hibiscus Avenue, then 
north on Russell. From Interstate 215, travel west on Van Buren. Taped 
information: (714) 780-2694. 
</P>
<P>
The Inland Herb Society is a group of herb enthusiasts formed 15 years ago in 
Riverside. The group welcomes new members. Meetings usually are held the third 
Sunday of the month at UC Riverside Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Dues are $5 a year and include a monthly newsletter that has been recognized by 
herb experts throughout the country. Membership information can be obtained by 
writing to the Inland Herb Society, 15665 Russell St., Riverside 92504.

THANKSGIVING: NEW TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poet Susan Polis Schutz specializes in love, as evidenced by 11 books of 
poetry, of which 15 million copies -- all devoted to the one topic -- have been 
sold. Her latest, entitled simply "Love," is due out this month (Blue Mountain 
Press, P. O. Box 4549 , Boulder, Colo. 80306); $15.95). 
</P>
<P>
Schutz dedicates her poetry to her husband and family and focuses on 
communications and sharing with loved ones. In line with that, she offers some 
advice about Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's not enough to break bread with others -- you must break through 
as well," she said. And one method she suggests is by creating new Thanksgiving 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people don't know how to communicate emotionally," she said, explaining 
that they feel uncomfortable saying out loud that they care. "A special 
ceremony on an appropriate day like Thanksgiving can give people 'permission' 
to try. A simple, effective way is through poetry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Following are some tips from Schutz for establishing new Thanksgiving 
traditions: 
</P>
<P>
* Have your guests write or bring a poem that expresses their love and 
gratitude for family and friends. Hold a poetry reading. Afterward, take 
photographs of your guests and place their poems next to the pictures in an 
album. 
</P>
<P>
* Have each guest write or bring a poem addressed to another guest. Instead of 
using name cards, put the poems at the place settings. 
</P>
<P>
* Create a special toast that goes beyond the simple, "Thanks for friends, 
family and food." It's a perfect time to express thoughtful sentiments that all 
too often go unsaid. Keep it brief, keep it simple, and acknowledge the people 
with you at table. 
</P>
<P>
* While everyone is still seated around the dinner table, have each person tell 
what they are thankful for. 
</P>
<P>
* Have everyone tell what their goals are for the next year -- what they hope 
to be thankful for next Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
* Invite everyone to share a special memory of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
* Begin to develop an attitude of gratitude. This is a positive way of thinking 
that can help you enjoy and appreciate life. It is an awareness of all that you 
are thankful for: family, friends, home, and more. While many people only give 
thanks on Thanksgiving, those with an attitude of gratitude give thanks every 
day. This leads to a healthy psyche that helps people get through difficult 
times.

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS, BREA-OLINDA ANSWERS

<P>
Brea-Olinda High School Coach Jon Looney received a phone call from assistant 
Randy Worthington at 9:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Looney was told Tuesday morning by Jean Sullivan, one of Brea's two principals, 
that the Wildcats had a chance to go to the Southern Section Division VI 
playoffs because Savanna had been ousted for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
"At 9:00 Friday morning, we still didn't know for sure that we were going," 
Looney said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brea capitalized on the short notice and routed Fullerton, 35-6, Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been upset that we didn't get into the playoffs," Looney said. "So I 
told the team, 'Now you've got the chance, make the most of it.' We've been 
waiting all year to play our best game." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats came out firing at the start of the first quarter. Running back Ed 
Stewart scored on a 20-yard run with 10:15 still left to play 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton answered with a five-yard pass from quarterback Rene Arias to 
Glenn Eggert two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
A 37-yard field goal by Hernandez gave the Wildcats a four-point lead at the 
end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was not heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, meanwhile, went on a rampage, scoring four times for the Wildcats and 
amassing 109 yards on 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart scored three times in the second quarter on runs of four, two and four 
yards to give the Wildcats a 29-6 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Looney credited his 17 returning lettermen, seven of whom are two-year 
veterans, for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like young kids who never played much," he said. "They knew what it 
would take to do this. We had two days to prepare, and to come out like this 
was just outstanding. I'm so proud of the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"A cat's got nine lives, and we used one of ours the other day and got into the 
playoffs," Looney said. "We wanted to prove we deserved to be here, and I think 
we did."

WESTERN ENDS ITS FIRST-ROUND TROUBLES

Led by a stingy defense, Western High School defeated Troy, 13-0, in a Southern 
Section Division VI first-round playoff game Friday at Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
For the Pioneers (9-2), it ended a frustrating trend of losing first-round 
playoff games. Western has made the playoffs in seven of the last eight years, 
but this was its first victory. 
</P>
<P>
"So we broke the jinx," Western Coach Jim Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Western will face La Mirada in the second round next week. 
</P>
<P>
Western advanced by holding Troy to six yards total offense and turning in its 
first shutout of the season. The Pioneers' defense wasn't stifling as much at 
it was pesky. 
</P>
<P>
Paced by 5-foot-3, 135-pound linebacker Kevin Byun, who had four solo tackles, 
and 6-foot-5, 245-pound lineman Tom Cowen, who had a couple of savage sacks, 
the Western defense stopped the Warriors' running game and harassed Troy 
quarterback Greg Windle. 
</P>
<P>
Windle, usually an able thrower, completed only five of 20 passes for 72 yards. 
And he was sacked four times for total losses of 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think we would be able to shut them out," Howell said. "But I 
knew we would play good defense." 
</P>
<P>
While their defense was shutting down Troy, the offense was barely fairing any 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Fortuitous field position was helpful, however. 
</P>
<P>
Troy's Steve Friedrich fumbled the game's opening kickoff and Western's John 
Walder recovered. Although Western quarterback Gilbert Brito couldn't lead much 
of a drive from there, he kicked a 28-yard field goal to give Western a 3-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
A poor Troy punt set up another Brito field goal, this one of 43 yards. That 
was all the scoring until Corey Manligius scored on a two-yard touchdown in the 
final seconds of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get much going offensively, but neither could they," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Troy finished the season 7-4.

LA MIRADA SHUNS 'TUNE-UP' ROLE, STUNS ESTANCIA

<TEXT>
<P>
La Mirada High School knocked previously unbeaten Estancia High School out of 
the Southern Section Division VI playoffs Friday night with a stunning 15-12 
upset at Davidson Field. 
</P>
<P>
With 9:22 left to play, La Mirada, trailing, 10-7, marched 78 yards in 14 plays 
to win when quarterback Chad Drown scrambled away from blitzing defenders and 
found Dan Arreguin open for a 23-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
"During the drive, we just kept saying to ourselves how all week long they were 
calling us 'tune-ups'," Drown said. "We didn't want to lose it like last year." 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada (8-4) botched the snap on the conversion but Drown, who doubles as 
the team's kicker, picked up the loose ball and passed to Jim Pace in the 
corner of the end zone for the successful two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Drown completed 14 of 25 for 167 yards and no interceptions, and hooked up with 
Eric DeLaCruz five times for 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to pass to be successful tonight," La Mirada Coach John Mele said, 
"and Chad Drown had a hell of a game." 
</P>
<P>
The Matador defense also did a job on the Eagles (10-1), forcing five Estancia 
turnovers -- three interceptions and two fumble recoveries -- and held Josh 
Wojtkiewicz to just 60 yards rushing.

NEWPORT HARBOR STOPS GLENN IN OVERTIME, 21-20

<P>
Newport Harbor High School's defensive line held fast on Glenn's two-point 
conversion rushing attempt to preserve a 21-20 overtime victory in the first 
round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs at La Mirada High School 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
After Glenn's two-point conversion pass from Hector Valdez to Travis Carter was 
nullified by offsetting penalties, Valdez handed off to Jerry Jonnadal who was 
tackled by a swarm of defenders a yard short of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Newport (9-2) won the coin toss after the regulation ended in a 14 -- 14 tie. 
Under California tiebreaker rules, the Sailors had four chances to score from 
the Eagle 10. On their last play, quarterback Stephen Scheck hit tight end 
George Greenwalt from the 2. Josh Klein's kick gave Newport Harbor a 21-14 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn had four chances from the 10 and Valdez hit Robert Ernster in the end 
zone from the seven on its second play. Valdez's swing pass to Carter appeared 
to give the game to the Eagles until the offsetting penalties.

VILLA PARK SURVIVES SHAKY START, THEN PUTS AWAY ESPERANZA

So much for flashy starts. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the Division III playoff game Friday night between 
Esperanza and Villa Park High Schools, Esperanza's Jarod Smith caught a 68-yard 
bomb from quarterback Keith McDonald over the top of the Villa Park defense for 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
From there, though, the game belonged to Villa Park. After Esperanza forged a 
14-6 lead on a 15-pass from McDonald to Jeff Corbett, Villa Park ran off six 
consecutive touchdowns and pulled away to a convincing 48-28 victory over 
visiting Esperanza at Fred Kelly Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to score, they might as well score in the first 10 seconds," 
Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "That gave us the whole game to make up the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park erased it with a vengeance. Leading the way was halfback Gary 
Bladow, whose 196 yards in 17 carries included three touchdown runs, the most 
important of which was a 40-yard sprint up the middle that tied the game at 
14-14 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park held a 20-14 lead at the half. But Villa Park sophomore Ellis 
Williams took a kickoff 47 yards to open the second half, and three plays 
later, quarterback Jason Martian scrambled 28 yards for a touchdown to make it 
27-14. 
</P>
<P>
Century League co-champion Villa Park (8-3) will face El Toro (10-1) in the 
second round next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we'll be healthy by then," Mahoney said. "Hopefully the kids will 
come back to school with no more than a bruise here and there." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza finished 6-5.

DOMINGUEZ FINDS THE TIME TO UPEND LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
It was the wildest 3 minutes and 59 seconds of James Jackson's life. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a sophomore tailback at Dominguez High School, scored two touchdowns 
and recovered a fumble in the final 3:59 Friday night to help the Dons upset 
Los Alamitos, 18-15, in the first round of the Division III football playoffs 
at Hanford Rants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez (8-3) advances to the second round against Mission Viejo. Los 
Alamitos (9-2) failed to reach the Division III final for the first time in 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
And it's all because of Jackson's fourth-quarter flurry. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who finished with 104 yards in 10 carries, scored on a 25-yard run 
with 3:59 left, recovered a fumble by Bob Simpson on the ensuing kickoff and 
scored from 31 yards out two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
And before he had a chance to catch his breath, Dominguez had turned a 7-6 
deficit into an 18-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big surprise to me because I haven't had much success lately," said 
Jackson, 5-feet-11 and 160 pounds. "I had a sore ankle and hadn't been running 
well. It's only about 97%." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's touchdown runs, both down the left sideline, were set up by fakes to 
fullback Bruce Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a 6-4, 245-pound senior, finished with 103 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"They were keying on Bruce and that opened things up for me on the outside," 
Jackson said. "I just kept thinking 'Get in, that's all you need to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said injuries to quarterback Todd Gragnano 
(ribs) and running back Erik Mitchell (ankle) hurt the Griffins' chances. Both 
returned, but Mitchell finished with only 26 yards in seven carries and 
Gragnano completed only three of 12 passes for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our effort was super," Barnes said. "I have no complaints about that. But Todd 
had hurt his ribs three weeks ago and then again (on a running play in the 
second quarter). He really gutted it out. I didn't know if he could come back 
in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano did most of the damage for the Griffins early. 
</P>
<P>
On the Griffins' first play from scrimmage Gragnano threw to wide receiver 
Tyler Cashman for a 63-yard gain to the Dominguez six-yard line. LaQuan 
Beckton, Mitchell's replacement, scored on the next play and Los Alamitos led, 
7-0. 
</P>
<P>
But Gragnano's 63-yard completion was his only one of the half as Dominguez's 
defense shut down the Griffins, who were averaging more than 34 points a game. 
Los Alamitos had only two first downs and 26 yards rushing in the first half.

REDLAND'S DRAGNA SCORES FIVE TIMES IN 39-29 VICTORY OVER MATER DEI

Anyone interested in what the Mater Dei High School football team was about in 
1989 need look no further than its first-round Division I playoff game against 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
In a season of big plays, both for and against the Monarchs, Friday's game at 
the University of Redlands proved a perfect Mater Dei microcosm -- if not a 
desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands won the game, 39-29, and won it with big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands' running back Mike Dragna, a 5-foot-7, 145-pounder who looks as if his 
shoulder pads are too large for him, rushed for 196 yards and five touchdowns, 
including runs of 72 and 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
To put that in perspective, consider that Dragna had rushed for all of 236 
yards during the regular season and scored scored six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But against Mater Dei, Dragna seemed practically unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
After Mater Dei scored the game's first touchdown on a seven-yard run by Kealii 
Clifford, Redlands took over on its own 20. 
</P>
<P>
On a third-and-two situation, Dragna went straight into the Mater Dei line, 
busted through untouched and was into the secondary so fast that Mater Dei 
defensive backs barely had a chance to react. 
</P>
<P>
All that was left for Dragna was to run straight for 72 yards and the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Dragna would score again, five minutes later, on a two-yard run which capped a 
58-yard Redlands' drive that was set up by a Mater Dei fumble. It was one of 
three fumbles the Monarchs lost. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei came back to tie on a 17-yard pass from quarterback Danny O'Neil to 
Tino Chavez early in the second quarter. Chavez' conversion kick tied the score 
at 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
But Redlands came right back with an 89-yard drive that ended with Dragna's 
18-yard touchdown run. The key play of the drive was a 45-yard pass from 
quarterback Julian Burrola to Marcus Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
A Redlands' field goal put the Terriers ahead, 23-14, but Mater Dei, on an 
eight-yard pass from O'Neil to Dan Fleming, scored a touchdown to pull to 
within 23-21 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Dragna's 49-yard run early in the third quarter put Redlands up 29-21. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei tied the score at 29 with little more than a minute left in the 
quarter on Clifford's one-yard run, and a two-point conversion pass from O'Neil 
to Jonathon Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The track meet quality of the game continued as Redlands drove from its own 39 
to the Mater Dei nine. The drive stalled and Julio Ocana kicked his second 
field goal, this one from 26-yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dragna, of course, put the finishing touches on this one, scoring on a 
three-yard run that ended a 46-yard drive set up by a Mater Dei fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's last gasp ended with about two minutes left, when O'Neil's 
fourth-down pass to Clifford at the Redlands' 17 fell incomplete.

<P>
Running back Ron Rivers rushed for 170 yards and scored 24 points to lead San 
Bernardino's San Gorgonio High School over Ocean View, 32-24, at Huntington 
Beach High Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It all came easily after the line started blocking," Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers scored three touchdowns, one in each of the first three quarters, 
including a 37-yard return of an interception. He also scored three two-point 
conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View scored on a 16-yard pass from Randy Karliner to Albert Fanaga three 
minutes into the game, but the Seahawks didn't score another touchdown until 
they scored twice in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the opportunities," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said, "but we just 
didn't capitalize on them." 
</P>
<P>
Karliner completed seven of 15 passes for 129 yards, but San Gorgonio sacked 
him seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team," San Gorgonio Coach Karl Gayton said. "This is the first 
time we weren't able to just run up the middle." PAM CEREN

EDISON RECOVERS AFTER SLOW START

<P>
You could excuse the Edison High School fans gathered at Orange Coast College 
Friday night for taking a quick check of their programs in the first quarter to 
make sure that Crespi star Russell White had indeed graduated. 
</P>
<P>
When Leonice Brown sprinted up the middle for a 65-yard touchdown -- leaving 
Edison defenders farther behind with each stride -- it looked as if the 
Chargers might be in for a long night. The kind of night Crespi's opponents 
endured for the past four years facing White, who holds the Southern Section 
career rushing record with 5,998 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the Edison defense ended Brown's impersonation of White in a hurry, holding 
the Crespi back to five more yards in his next eight carries. And the Edison 
offense, which had been giving a clinic in self-destruction during the early 
going, righted itself and the Chargers came away with a 20-10 victory in the 
first round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They meet Eisenhower Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the star back on this night was Edison's Shane Sherman, a sure-footed 
5-foot-11, 175-pound senior who picked his way through the Crespi defense for 
153 yards and both Charger touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some big holes out there tonight," Sherman said. "I just tried to 
read the blocks and make the right moves." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers started out making all the wrong moves. Mostly on the line of 
scrimmage . . . before the ball was snapped. A pair of illegal procedure 
penalties ended their first drive. And early in the second quarter, they drove 
to the Crespi one-yard line, where they were whistled for back-to-back illegal 
procedure calls and had to settle for a 28-yard Doug Merlino field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Edison finally put together an error-free, 80-yard drive, with quarterback 
Donnie Smith completing passes of 12, 33 and then a 22-yard shovel pass to 
Sherman. Sherman popped through for a nine-yard touchdown run with 1:18 left in 
the half and Edison led, 10-7, at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we should have had more points at halftime," Edison Coach Dave 
White said. "We were killing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi tied the score on a 29-yard field goal by Bill Canalez midway through 
the third quarter, but Sherman and the defense took over after that. Sherman 
capped another 80-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
And defensive back Mike Cunningham ended Crespi's final scoring threat when he 
picked off a Danny LaCava pass in the corner of the end zone. Merlino's 27-yard 
field goal put the game out of Crespi's reach with 2:11 left to play.

VELASCO'S PASSING SPELLS VICTORY FOR TAFT, 21-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the man who stenciled Taft High quarterback Edwin Velasco's name on the 
back of his football jersey had a stuttering problem. Or maybe an earthquake 
hit in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, it reads: VELALASCO, on both his home and away uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
An additional syllable to be sure, but Velasco had a little something extra in 
Friday night's West Valley League championship game at Pierce College, tossing 
three touchdown passes as Taft defeated El Camino Real in a thriller, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, a 5-foot-10 senior, completed five of nine passes for 103 yards. A 
mediocre effort? Hardly. Velasco had thrown one scoring pass all season 
entering the game, and that came last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I finally got it together," Velasco deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
For Taft (5-4, 4-3 in league play), it marked a fourth consecutive league 
title. El Camino Real (4-5, 3-4) missed an opportunity for its first league 
title since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
And the Conquistadores missed by inches. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco connected on a 27-yard scoring pass with Daryl (Happy) Cash in the 
closing moments of the third quarter and Irving Carter scored on a two-point 
conversion run to give Taft a 21-14 lead, but El Camino Real nearly stole it in 
the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Taking possession at its 33-yard line with 6:33 left, El Camino Real moved to 
the Taft 10. A key play in the drive was quarterback Tony Bordwell's third-down 
swing pass to Brian Astgen, who gained 15 yards and a first down. After the 
whistle, the Conquistadores received another 15 yards for an unsportsmanlike 
conduct call against Taft's Greg Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, on second and eight from the 10, fullback Jamal Anderson 
slammed through the middle and into the end zone to bring El Camino Real to 
within a point with 3:04 left. The Conquistadores went for two and the outright 
title, dusting off a double-option play. 
</P>
<P>
Lining up with a two-back set, Bordwell ran left and pitched to Anderson, who 
ran into Taft's Steve Lockridge, Alex Price and Darnell Hendrix at the goal 
line. Anderson tried to dive over the top, but was stopped just short and 
thrown backward. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a power-option play," El Camino Real co-Coach Mike Maio said. "He made 
the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who gained a game-high 134 yards in 21 carries and scored two 
touchdowns, had the option to pitch the ball to the trailing tailback on the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited all year for a two-point conversion to run it," Maio said. "But he 
did the right thing. Without him, we would never have gotten here." 
</P>
<P>
Taft was the first team this season to defeat El Camino Real in a game where 
Anderson gained more than 100 yards but it took Velasco's magic to do it.

NOTRE DAME POSTS FIRST PLAYOFF WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the modest offensive output of Notre Dame High was hardly befitting a 
team that has buried recent opponents, the Knights' 10-3 victory over Righetti 
on Friday undoubtedly will be inked in the annals of school history. 
</P>
<P>
Before this Southern Section Division VII playoff opener, Notre Dame had not 
won a postseason football game since the school opened in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of a monkey on my back -- everybody talked about it so much," 
said Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney, adding that he will have to further sharpen 
his offense to survive in the playoffs. "I don't think we can drop a bunch of 
passes and get penalized like we did and win again." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will play San Marino, a 14-6 winner over South Torrance, next week 
in the second round of the playoffs at a site to be announced. Righetti 
finishes 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (10-1) mounted the game-winning drive late in the third quarter 
after linebacker Anthony Fanara batted down Pat Risher's pass on a fake punt on 
fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights took over at their 41-yard line and moved the ball into Righetti 
territory on a nine-yard run by Errol Small and a 19-yard pass from Greg 
Andrachick to Guillermo Eguez. 
</P>
<P>
On third and seven at the Knights' 28, Tim Elliot caught an eight-yard pass, 
was hit and fumbled. Notre Dame's Setefano Malieitulua recovered at the 16 to 
sustain the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, with 8:52 to play, Andrachick faked a handoff to Small, 
rolled right on a bootleg and dived into the end zone. Chris Afarian added the 
point-after touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Small led all rushers with 73 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little bigger than we've faced," Righetti Coach Tom Hawkins said of 
Small, who has gained 1,117 yards on the ground. "We had problems wrapping him. 
But as far as shiftiness, I don't think he's going to be a big-time running 
back. He's a good-looking athlete, though." 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed for several minutes shortly before the intermission so 
Notre Dame's Anthony Rodriguez, whose leg was injured, could be taken from the 
field on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Anthony Martinez was chased out of the pocket and unloaded a 
pass that was intercepted by Fanara at midfield and returned to the Righetti 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Because there were 10 seconds left after Fanara's return, Notre Dame had time 
for one play. 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick's pass barely glanced off the fingertips of Eguez, who was in the 
end zone. The Knights settled for a 31-yard field goal by Afarian to tie the 
score, 3-3.

DANA HILLS BLASTED BY HART, 41-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as at-large teams go, Dana Hills High was a monster, it was said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins were 7-3 and had allowed only 81 points all season. Most 
fourth-place teams give that up in a couple of weeks. But fourth place was as 
good as Dana Hills could do in a South Coast League that boasted El Toro, 
Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Hart wasn't exactly pleased about drawing such a wild wild card in the first 
round of the Division III playoffs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, however, were the ones running wild, riding the legs of running 
back Howard Blackwell to a 41-13 win at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell gained 189 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns in 18 carries and 
caught five passes for an additional 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the easiest draw in the playoffs, but Blackwell said that Hart (10-1) 
wasn't intimidated either. 
</P>
<P>
"We can score on anybody, any time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills Coach Don Douglas couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has done that to us all year," he said. "Blackwell was magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that way all the way. The Dolphins scored on their first drive on 
standout fullback Matt Carvalho's three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the night was all Hart, though," Douglas said. "They just whupped 
us." 
</P>
<P>
It was Dana Hills' worst loss of the season. The Dolphins were defeated, 41-21, 
by El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rob Westervelt did his share, completing 10 of 20 for 170 yards and 
two touchdowns. Chad Fotheringham added a 45-yard touchdown pass to John DePaco 
on a double pass. 
</P>
<P>
DePaco also caught a 27-yard pass from Westervelt. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Migita was on the receiving end of Westervelt's other touchdown, a 
seven-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
Carvalho, who had gained more than 1,200 yards going in, was limited to 63 
yards in 16 carries. Dana Hills had an opportunity to increase its 7-0 lead 
when Blackwell fumbled the kickoff after Carvalho's touchdown. However, Andy 
Marrone dropped a perfect Grant Taylor pass in the end zone on third down and 
Ryan Harrison then missed a 23-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Marrone came back to catch an eight-yard touchdown pass from Taylor with 31 
seconds left in the half, cutting the deficit to 28-13.

Martin fumble, and Montay Hardison returned it 43 yards for the score. 
</P>

Grant 20, North Hollywood 13 -- Grant quarterback Marlowe Lewis completed four 
of nine passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns at North Hollywood as the 
Lancers (9-1, 6-1) clinched the league title. Grant stopped a North Hollywood 
drive in the closing minutes on its 18-yard line to secure the win. 
</P>
<P>
After fullback Tony Johnson gave Grant a 7-0 lead midway through the first 
quarter, North Hollywood marched 67 yards in 12 plays and scored on the first 
play of the second quarter, a one-yard run by Leon Gable. 
</P>
<P>
On Grant's next play, Lewis took advantage of a missing North Hollywood 
cornerback and completed an 80-yard pass play to John Kesselman. The Huskies 
(2-8, 2-5) had only 10 players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, Gable fumbled and Grant took over at the North 
Hollywood 30. Five plays later, Lewis completed a 21-yard pass to Anthony 
Milton for a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood sacked Lewis three times in the second half. Gable ran 15 yards 
to complete the scoring. Gable carried 24 times for 127 yards and two 
touchdowns. He has rushed for 1,121 yards despite missing three games because 
of an ankle injury. STEVE WILLIAMS

Sylmar 48, Poly 26 -- Running back Jerome Casey scored six touchdowns and 
rushed for 260 yards in 24 carries to lead the Spartans (8-2, 5-2) at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Casey gave Sylmar the lead for good when he scored his third touchdown on the 
first play of the second quarter, keying a 21-point period. 
</P>
<P>
His run capped a five-play, 49-yard drive in which he carried the ball every 
time. Casey accounted for more than two-thirds of the Spartans' 380 yards in 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Poly halfback Jonathan Campbell gained 169 yards in 31 carries and scored three

UNDERSIZED PIERCE CUTS OPPONENTS DOWN TO SIZE IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are Yugos, Leona Helmsley's heart, subdivided lots in Chatsworth. Louisa 
May Alcott could have written their press guide, they're so small. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, but how they have been effective. The Pierce College women's volleyball 
team consists of a bunch of undersized dynamos who have earned the team its 
first berth in the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's kind of like, 'Oh, good, everybody's small,' but I like it," 
5-foot-1 1/2 setter Amy Sodek said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fielding a starting six that averages a Lilliputian, in volleyball 
terms, 5-6 1/2, Pierce has been walking tall with a 17-2 record and 
second-place finish in the Western State Conference behind Cuesta, the only 
team to defeat Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams in the league, their shorter players are 5-6," Coach Steve 
Gazzaniga said. "We jump very well. Though we average 5-6, we probably play 
like we're 5-9." 
</P>
<P>
After Pierce finished 11-7 last year, Gazzaniga recruited an entirely new team. 
None of his nine players -- eight freshmen and sophomore transfer Anna Suarez 
-- had played for Pierce, and it didn't take a wide-angle lens to fit this crew 
in a team photo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real apprehensive," said Gazzaniga, who believes that his team is the 
shortest in the conference. "I knew we'd have to win with defense and control 
points on the serve." 
</P>
<P>
Like martial artists, the Pierce players have a knack for transforming an 
opponent's strength into a weakness. Pierce's pinball-machine defense gobbles 
up the ball, pops it around and spits it back across the net -- repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons is inherent in shorter people," Gazzaniga said of his 
team's emphasis on defense. "Tall people play at a different level. The people 
who aren't as tall have to learn more ball control around the net, and they 
have to be great in the back row. Most of the time when you get those (rallies) 
two, three, four times around the net, we're going to win because we put the 
ball on the money." 
</P>
<P>
No Pierce player ranks among the top 10 in the conference in solo blocks, but 
Pierce manages to touch nearly every ball. Opposing spikers must feel like 
they're punching a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of teams that have the ability to hit over our block, and they 
get frustrated when it comes back at them," Gazzaniga said. "If they're smart, 
they make an adjustment. . . . They get mad so they want to hit it harder." 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Pierce avoids that sort of volleyball one-upmanship. Pierce has 
compiled a conference-leading hitting percentage of .335 with an assortment of 
kills, dinks and off-speed shots. Cuesta and Santa Monica are tied for a 
distant second at .249. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like facing Nolan Ryan and then bringing (knuckle ball pitcher) Charlie 
Hough in," Gazzaniga said. "They're going to get worked." 
</P>
<P>
The stars of the Pierce offense revolve around disparate poles: outside hitter 
Suarez and setter Sodek. Suarez is 5-8 but a quick leaper who plays taller. She 
frequently breaks into wide smiles while on the floor, and her play has kept 
her teammates on the beam. 
</P>
<P>
Sodek, a left-hander who may well be the best setter in the conference, wears 
her worried frown of concentration like a mask. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a lot to think about," Sodek said. "It's very stressful. You don't 
get much time to sit back and analyze. A lot of thought is put into it." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce wins with guile, and Sodek is the most cunning. It is her job to keep 
the ball away from the opponent's block and set it for her hottest hitters. 
</P>
<P>
That often means feeding Suarez. A part-time starter last year at Cal State 
Northridge and Pierce's kill leader with 228 this year, Suarez has been around 
the block in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our star," Gazzaniga said. "She leads with her attacking; all facets of 
her game are strong. She's also a star in my mind for her steadiness." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with redshirting at Northridge, Suarez instead joined the Pierce team 
shortly before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bonus for us," Sodek said. "She's such a leader and such an 
inspiration to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Although Suarez has nearly twice as many kills as any of her teammates, middle 
blocker Andrea Banducci leads the team and conference with a .458 hitting 
percentage. Banducci (6-0) is the only Pierce player with a classic volleyball 
build, and she boasts a bullet serve. 
</P>
<P>
Carina Sailer plays middle blocker despite being only 5-7 1/2. She is second in 
the conference in hitting percentage at .435. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way, really, she should be where she's at, but she'll beat blocks 
because she's so quick," Gazzaniga said. 
</P>
<P>
Gina Johnson (5-5) and Alissa Levisohn (5-5) are the other starters and Shari 
Sakamoto (5-4) is the top reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The squad is synergistic, remarkably so because everyone is new. They are not, 
however, new to each other. Sodek and Sailer were teammates at Royal. Suarez 
and Levisohn attended Chaminade and several team members have played club 
volleyball together. 
</P>
<P>
They've come together for one year in the limelight. Suarez will definitely 
move on, and other players may as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams like us are neat because we're kind of an underdog," Gazzaniga said. 
</P>
<P>
Short teams like his are going the way of the California condor: They may soar 
now but are ultimately doomed to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
They may be short, and ultimately short-lived, but they will attempt to make 
short work of their playoff foes. 
</P>
<P>
"We compensate for lack of height with attitude and desire," Suarez said. "I 
think maybe it's even an advantage. Our lack of height makes us work harder to 
be better players."

RAMONA SURPRISES CRAWFORD

<P>
It could have been dismissed as sandbagging. Before Friday night's San Diego 
Section playoff game, Crawford Coach Dan Armstrong wanted to convince his 
audience that he was awestruck by his opening-round opponent, Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
That's right Ramona, the Avocado League's fourth-place team that got to the 
playoffs with a 6-4 record and without so much as knocking off a top-10 team. 
</P>
<P>
"After the pairing meeting, I heard a couple coaches saying, 'Ramona is going 
to pump Crawford,' " said Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
Pump? How about stifle, or maybe squelch? 
</P>
<P>
That's right, not much was heard of the Central champs as Ramona took a 17-3 
victory to move into the quarterfinals against Mission Bay next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the only one who actually thought Armstrong was sandbagging was Mel 
Galli, Ramona coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievable," Galli said. "A fourth place team beating a champion!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, it happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Ramona held Crawford to 31 total yards. What's more, the 
Colts did not score until the gun sounded to end the half and J.J. Wadas' 
37-yard field goal sailed through the goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
It was 7-3 at that point, a score which fails to show how dominant the Bulldogs 
actually were. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts could not carry, pass or kick the ball past midfield until two 
minutes remained in the half -- a statistic which begs another question. 
</P>
<P>
If Ramona had the ball in Crawford's defensive half of the field for virtually 
the entire first two quarters (and it did, starting drives at the 39 twice, the 
32 and 46), then why did it find the end zone only once? 
</P>
<P>
Penalties, two turnovers, and inspired play by the heavily outweighed Crawford 
defensive line provided the answer to that querie. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic defensive play turned in by Crawford was Peter 
Irvin's interception at the four on a first-and-goal play from the eight. 
</P>
<P>
Even on Ramona's scoring drive, the Bulldogs looked as though they might come 
up short, despite moving to a first-and-goal at the one in five plays. 
</P>
<P>
A holding penalty negated a would-be Thomas Smith touchdown run, but on the 
very next play Lamont Horton was called for pass interference, giving the 
Bulldogs a new first-and-goal at the five. 
</P>
<P>
Smith picked up four on the first play. Maybe Galli didn't take note, but 
Smith's number was not called again until fourth-and-one. He got in. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona came out for the second half as if it had just finished warming up while 
Crawford showed up looking like it had just emerged from a double-overtime 
struggle.

ROWLETT, MIRA MESA GRIND OUT 15-6 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Mira Mesa's J.J. Rowlett was a quarterback doing all the things it took to win. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel's Larry Lehman was a quarterback doing all the things it took not to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
Admirable efforts both, but Rowlett did enough to lead Mira Mesa to a 15-6 
first-round San Diego Section 3-A playoff victory at Mt. Carmel High School and 
advance the Marauders (8-3) to the second round next weekend against Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
It was a slug-it-out game of football that was a defensive struggle in the 
first half, turned into a Mt. Carmel ball-control marathon in the third quarter 
and finished with a bang when Rowlett turned in a couple of impressive 
fourth-quarter plays. 
</P>
<P>
With Mira Mesa trailing, 6-2, as the fourth quarter opened, Rowlett scored on a 
29-yard run with 7:20 to play to put his team ahead, then set up Wayne 
Pittman's one-yard clincher with 2:28 left by passing 30 yards to Mike 
Tompkins. 
</P>
<P>
Rowlett spent most of the night looking downfield, either with his arm cocked 
or his head down. He completed five of eight passes for 99 yards, and he 
carried the ball 11 times for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman, on the other hand, spent the evening handing off to Jeff Scott (21 
carries for 80 yards and one touchdown) and throwing short flares. He also 
completed 16 of 24 passes for 119 yards. All but one of his completions were 
for less than 10 yards each. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what Mt. Carmel Coach Bill Christopher wanted because Lehman, 
normally a flanker, was making his first varsity start at quarterback. Matt 
Miller tore up a knee two weeks ago to throw a wrench into the Mt. Carmel 
offensive plans. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of two fourth quarter interceptions, Lehman played well -- particularly 
during a third quarter drive which resulted in Mt. Carmel's only touchdown. The 
Sundevils moved 82 yards in 17 plays to open the third quarter, consuming 7:48. 
In all, Mira Mesa had the ball for only 3:03 during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Mira Mesa was able to come back, thanks in large part to Rowlett, a 
6-foot-4, 205-pound senior. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid is a heck of an athlete," Mira Mesa Coach Bill Griffith said. "He's a 
Division I football player." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, the only score in the first half was by the Mira Mesa defense, 
which forced a safety with 2:31 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth and eight from the Mt. Carmel 22, Sundevil punter Mike Graves was 
forced to scoop a snap off the ground. He fielded it cleanly but, by the time 
he looked up, several Mira Mesa defenders were moving through the line. Graves 
took off, but he was caught in the end zone by linebacker Nigel Allen and 
defensive back Frankie Edsall. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-0 halftime score wasn't surprising, because this game shaped up as a 
defensive battle from the start. Mt. Carmel, led by its defensive line of 
Derrick Roth, Mike Estanol, Brian Berry, Anthony Salvanera and Shawn Adams, 
held Mira Mesa to zero first downs in the first quarter and to just three for 
the first half. Mira Mesa got off just 10 offensive plays in the first quarter, 
two of which were punts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mira Mesa defense was up to the challenge. Mt. Carmel managed just four 
first downs in the first half and punted on three of five possessions.

DISCOVERY: CONDO'S ROCK AND SHELL SHOP

Who sells seashells by the seashore? Condo's Rock and Shell Shop, 100 yards 
from the shore in Seal Beach, that's who. For the last 40 years, Condo's has 
been offering shells from around the world to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
Although it seems odd to sell something that Mother Nature offers free, the 
population boom in Southern California, as well as tidal and other factors, 
have stripped local beaches of many of the popular shells favored by collectors 
and souvenir hunters. A storm may bring an unbroken sand dollar or two, but if 
you are looking for starfish, sea horses or other gems from the deep, a retail 
store is your best bet. 
</P>
<P>
For the serious collector, Condo's offers rare shells from the Philippines, 
Indonesia, Australia and Florida. The most expensive item in the store is a 
golden cowrie from India, available for $300, said store manager Cookie Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clientele is split about 50-50 between collectors and souvenir hunters," 
Turner said. "I think it's the fascination with Mother Nature, seeing what 
comes out of the ocean," that makes people buy shells, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry featuring shells is available, with shark-tooth necklaces seeming to be 
the big favorite. A shark's jaw featuring a whole set of teeth is available for 
someone who wants such a conversation piece in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Condo's also has decorative coral and other marine works. So if you want a 
little part of the sea in your home, this is the place.

BENEFIT TRAVELS UP LAZY RIVER BOAT

The Scene 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's Reuben E. Lee river boat-restaurant, where the Red Ribbon 100 
women's advisory council to the Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross 
-- and hundreds more -- stepped aboard Tuesday for an evening of champagne and 
wine tasting. 
</P>
<P>
The moon wasn't quite as full as the showboat (filled to capacity with about 
400 guests). Elbows got a full workout, bending frequently to lift those 
souvenir champagne glasses and politely prodding their way through the 
close-packed crowd. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth year, the Showboat Champagne Fest was sold out well in advance, 
according to event chairwoman Jane Martin. At $65 per person, the event brought 
in about $30,000, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Most popular table again this year was Robert Mondavi, where a new vintage 
(1986) of Opus 1 Cabernet was being uncorked. At $55 a bottle, Opus 1 is the 
most expensive domestic wine, according to a Mondavi representative. Those with 
even more expensive tastes climbed the stairs to the wheelhouse, where a Remy 
Martin representative offered a brief lecture and sips of Louis XIII cognac at 
$600 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz 
</P>
<P>
This year the Red Ribbon 100 won't need a meeting to decide where the money 
should go. Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake already made that 
decision, Martin said. Awareness of the Red Cross' urgent needs this year made 
the revelers more appreciative than ever of their own good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code 
</P>
<P>
"Late-day business," according to Red Ribbon member Donna Brownell. That was 
defined by guests as anything from I-just-left-the-office attire to sequins and 
furs. 
</P>
<P>
On the Menu 
</P>
<P>
A feast of seafood snacks befitting not just a river boat but a cruise ship, 
from stir-fried shrimp to oysters Rockefeller, garnished with bread in the 
shape of lobsters and alligators. Plus a plethora of desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
So much for all those nautical terms they taught you in sailing class, mate. On 
this boat, starboard was still starboard, but as one crew member explained to a 
confused group of tasters, "No, no, no. Port is upstairs. Desserts are 
downstairs. . . . "And one guest said to another: "I'll bet if you went around 
and tasted every one of these, you could learn an awful lot about wine." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but you wouldn't be able to remember any of it." 
</P>
<P>
The event organizers thought of that: Each guest packet included an admonition 
to "please be conscientious" with alcohol, and an offer of a taxi ride home, if 
necessary. JAN HOFMANN

PHOTOGRAPHY: PLAN AHEAD FOR HOLIDAY GIFT PHOTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning ahead is the key to success if you want to give a photograph as a 
holiday gift. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs you've already shot make easy, inexpensive gifts. All you have to 
do is give yourself time to have them enlarged and framed. And it's a gift that 
will last many years. (While you're at it, why not transfer the photos from the 
shoe box to an album? Edit out those pictures that are out of focus and where 
your subjects' eyes are closed.) 
</P>
<P>
A photo collage also makes a great gift. The photos might be of the recipient 
and his or her favorite people or, if the recipient is across the miles, a 
collage of you and other people near and dear would be even better. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget those photo greeting cards from your local photo finisher. They 
make a very personal card with very little effort, but they usually take two to 
three weeks to produce. Again, plan ahead. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite New Year's gifts is a homemade photo calendar. This is for 
enthusiasts with their own home darkrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's Camera Store Inc. in Cedar Falls, Iowa, is the only store I've found 
that regularly stocks a supply of Kodalith (high contrast) calendar masks in a 
variety of shapes and sizes for both horizontal and vertical images. They range 
from 5 by 7 inches to 16 by 20. For more information contact Porter's at (800) 
553-2001. 
</P>
<P>
For those less inclined to do their own photography for holiday gifts, another 
option might be a portrait shot by either a formal portrait studio or a quickie 
store or mall studio. 
</P>
<P>
Here is where advance planning really counts. If it needs to be mailed, you 
might need to schedule to have your portrait taken this week. 
</P>
<P>
Store studios such as those at Sears and J.C. Penney are inexpensive and 
provide a good product. But don't expect makeup or hair styling or any 
intricate lighting or backgrounds. To give the photos a holiday flair, dress 
the part. 
</P>
<P>
You may think you will spend only $14.95, but be prepared to spend as much as 
$50. They always print a larger number of photographs than your coupon package 
includes, which makes it hard to walk out the door without all the prints in 
your hand. Remember, give yourself plenty of time -- it will take at least two 
weeks for them to process and print your portraits. These studios don't take 
reservations, so plan on waiting. The holiday season is always the busiest for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a high-quality photograph, one that you would hang over 
the fireplace, choose a full-service portrait studio. You'll save time because 
they make appointments. They can help you with hair styling, makeup, wardrobe 
and the proper setting and background. The prints will be of higher quality 
because of the lighting, print making and retouching. Plan on spending between 
$250 and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to give someone a camera for Christmas, you'll face a multitude 
of options. The real choice comes between the more expensive 35-millimeter, 
single-lens-reflex camera and the compact point-and-shoots. But for most on 
your list, a simple point-and-shoot is best. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major changes to look for in the 35-mm. SLR include a more 
streamlined look with built-in strobe, motor drives and various program modes. 
It's almost impossible to find one that doesn't include automatic focus, 
exposure and film advance. If you're buying for the hobbyist or a photo student 
on your list, make sure the camera includes manual settings. 
</P>
<P>
For those just looking to capture a few spontaneous moments with little effort, 
it's a good idea to pick a 35-mm. compact automatic-everything off the shelf. 
The prices range from $100 to $300, and the options seem to fit every need. 
Features to look for include: wireless remote, power zoom lenses, drop-in 
loading, weatherproofing and dual lens selection. 
</P>
<P>
The best feature to consider is the dual or zoom lens. Having access to at 
least two focal lengths, such as 35-mm. and 70-mm., really gives your images 
more variety. 
</P>
<P>
Also consider photographic art as a gift. High on my list is an Ansel Adams 
print, but a $10,000 price tag certainly isn't realistic. However, it is 
possible to find many fine works at the $200-to-$500 level by many well-known 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Susan Spiritus Gallery in Costa Mesa, for example, you might find a John 
Sexton, Henry Gilpin or George Tice print. It will be a gift that will go up in 
value as photography works its way up in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Contest. A photographic holiday card contest is being sponsored by the Cypress 
College photography department. The work can be made with any photographic 
process. The images will be displayed at the Photo Gallery on campus. There are 
no fees, and participation is open to the public. Deadline is Dec. 15. Prizes

St., Cypress, Calif. 90630. For more information, call (714) 826-2220, Ext. 
244. 
</P>
<P>

KEY AGENCIES AGREE TO CURB WETLANDS LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two federal agencies have agreed to curtail the loss of wetlands through a 
unified policy on development, the administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers share federal oversight responsibility 
for wetlands, but their rules have not always jibed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had over the years some differences in policy reflected in different 
definitions, in different approaches to consideration of a proposal to develop 
a wetland or alter a wetland resource," William K. Reilly told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said previous policies "have confused the public and perhaps contributed 
to less than a stellar performance in wetlands conservation." 
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after addressing an EPA conference. The agreement had 
been signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, wetlands development proposals will be assessed first in 
terms of whether alternatives exist, Reilly said. After that question has been 
resolved, the agreement calls for the two agencies to address questions of 
compensation and how to carry out development in the least destructive ways. 
</P>
<P>
Much wetlands decision-making is in the hands of state and local governments. 
The principal federal power is the Corps, which grants permits for putting fill 
in waterways and wetlands. The EPA has certain veto powers over the process. 
</P>
<P>
About 95 million acres of swamps, marshes and other wetlands exist in the Lower 
48 states, with more than 200 million acres in Alaska, said Cliff Rader of the 
EPA's wetlands protection office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said 300,000 to 500,000 acres of wetlands are lost each year in the 
United States because of drainage, pollution and development. 
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, once thought to be breeding grounds of disease, are considered 
important to water purification and storage, habitat for wildlife, including 
many endangered species, and in the productivity of marine life, including 
commercially important species.

DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WORK TO BREAK BUDGET DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Democratic congressional leaders groped toward a compromise Friday on a 
critical budget bill that would break a weeks-long deadlock and clear a path 
for adjournment next week of the first session of the 101st Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and House Ways and 
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) met privately throughout the 
day in an effort to bridge differences over a roughly $6-billion revenue 
package and cuts in the Medicare program. Separate negotiations were also 
taking place to break a House-Senate deadlock over the controversial 
"catastrophic" health insurance plan that the House wants repealed and the 
Senate wants scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the two committees on tax changes would complete work on a 
roughly $14-billion deficit-reduction bill that must be passed if Congress is 
to meet its budget goals for the year. The package, which will include dozens 
of spending cuts, will also include savings achieved by automatic budget cuts 
triggered Oct. 16 when Congress and the White House failed to meet the fiscal 
1990 deficit target of $110 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Those across-the-board cuts, known as a sequester, save more than $1 billion a 
month. And the final fiscal package is likely to include as much as three 
months' worth of the automatic savings. Passage of the deficit-reduction bill 
would lift the automatic cuts for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
House and Senate leaders were hoping for an agreement by late Friday night to 
permit floor debate on the budget package beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) predicted Friday that the budget 
cutting bill will be satisfactory to President Bush, who this month challenged 
Congress to pass a measure that would be stripped of extraneous items and 
fiscal gimmicks and that would cut the federal deficit by at least $14 billion. 
Bush said at the time he would veto unacceptable legislation and permit the 
roughly $16 billion in automatic spending cuts mandated by the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law to remain in effect for the full fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"Relatively speaking, it will be a clean bill," Foley said. "I don't think, as 
I said before, there would be any reason for the President, on budget grounds, 
not to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Republicans, who had not seen all the details of the emerging budget 
bill being negotiated by Democrats, said it appears from its outlines that it 
would not meet the $14 billion in savings demanded by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"They fall substantially short," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, 
ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders are banking on White House acceptance of some budgetary 
sleight-of-hand that the Administration agreed to in April's budget summit with 
Capitol Hill. These include savings of $1.7 billion achieved by not calculating 
Postal Service losses in the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Calif.) predicted that the 
budget bill could be ready for consideration by the full House Sunday. 
Referring to the decision to have Rostenkowski and Bentsen thrash out the 
differences without other conference committee members present, Panetta said: 
"At least we've got the two bulls in the corral." 
</P>
<P>
The House passed its $11-billion version of the budget measure, known as a 
reconciliation bill, in early October, adding to it dozens of unrelated 
provisions that are being dropped in conference with the Senate. The Senate's 
$14-billion version of the bill was passed Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The tax-writing committees must come up with at least $5.3 billion in new 
revenues, plus a bit less than $2 billion in spending cuts, primarily in 
Medicare. The overall budget package is likely to include changes in law that 
would cut the deficit about $11.5 billion, plus the additional savings of $3 
billion to $4 billion from the across-the-board cuts under 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. 
</P>
<P>
The package is likely to include extensions of several popular but money-losing 
tax breaks that are due to expire, including research and development and 
subsidized housing credits.

CAMP PENDLETON ON EPA LIST FOR WASTE DUMPING; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ARE DISCOVERED AT SIX SITES. HOWEVER, THE 
MILITARY SAYS THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER TO BASE RESIDENTS OR WILDLIFE.

<P>
The discovery of hazardous wastes dumped at Camp Pendleton has put the Marine 
Corps base on a list of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's top 
priorities, but there is no immediate danger to base residents or wildlife, 
military officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1988 Defense Department study found that pesticides, paint, solvents 
and fuel had contaminated the soil in six separate areas of Camp Pendleton, the 
EPA proposed that the base be added to its National Priorities List, said Lt. 
Patrick Gibbons, a spokesman. This week, it was among seven military bases to 
be added to the list, which requires further study and possible cleanup of the 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"Camp Pendleton has been here since 1942, before people became environmentally 
aware," Gibbons said. "For many years, we disposed of things in ways that we 
now know were unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons said the contamination does not pose a danger to people who live on 
or near the base. He said the camp's self-sufficient water supply, which is 
stored in an underground aquifer, has passed quality tests, which are conducted 
routinely. 
</P>
<P>
The areas requiring remedial investigation are: 
</P>
<P>
* An area near Vandegrift Boulevard at the bottom of Rattlesnake Canyon Road 
where pest-control trucks, used to spray insecticides, were washed out. 
</P>
<P>
* A drainage ditch near the Marine Corps Air Station, where solvents and paint 
were routinely dumped. 
</P>
<P>
* A firefighter drill field at the air station. Gasoline, jet fuel and diesel 
saturated the soil, as well as the chemical foams used to put out the fires. 
</P>
<P>
* The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office scrap yard, where some metal 
and old automobile batteries were buried. 
</P>
<P>
* The Stuart Mesa Stabilization Pond, a clay-lined lake used to filter sewage, 
site of some unauthorized dumping of oil and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
* The Las Pulgas landfill, where construction materials and a variety of toxic 
compounds were placed.

COUNCIL AGREES TO RECORD-SIZE DEVELOPMENT IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Westlake Village City Council and a developer reached an agreement early 
Friday under which the council will approve Westlake North, the largest 
development in the city's history, in exchange for a package of concessions the 
builder valued at $31.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The keys to the agreement were pledges by the developer, Westlake Village 
Associates, to preserve the town's golf course and to reduce the height of the 
project's tallest office buildings to four stories. 
</P>
<P>
After two evenings of public hearings that ran past midnight, three of the five 
City Council members announced they will vote to approve the project at a 
meeting Nov. 28. The residential and commercial development will be constructed 
on 129 acres of vacant land north of the Ventura Freeway and east of Lindero 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally compelled to vote for the project as it has come into focus in 
the past two days," Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier said. Councilmen Kenneth E. 
Rufener and Irwin A. Shane said they too would vote for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwomen Bonnie Klove and Berniece E. Bennett said they needed more time to 
decide, but Klove said: "I'm very happy with what I heard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North would include 250 condominiums and more than 1.4 million square 
feet of commercial space, with office buildings, a hotel and a shopping center. 
The four-story height limit is a departure from the two-story limit in the city 
general plan. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by Daniel K. Ludwig, would 
contract with the city to: 
</P>
<P>
* Pay nearly $6.5 million for road improvements, in addition to giving up $2.9 
million worth of land for road purposes. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay the city $3.5 million, which could be used for a new library and other 
projects such as storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
* Build within Westlake North a four-acre park, with completed soccer and 
softball fields, viewing stands, parking and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
* Guarantee for 200 years the preservation and maintenance of the 
developer-owned Westlake Village Golf Course and its driving range. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier said the road improvements, such as widening the Ventura Freeway 
interchange at Lindero Canyon Road, are needed to accommodate an unavoidable 
increase in future traffic from other projects outside the city. Three offers 
from other investors to purchase the golf course from Westlake Village 
Associates made the guaranteed preservation of the course imperative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier did not seek reelection this year, and Shane was defeated. They leave 
office Dec. 6 when James E. Emmons and Douglas R. Yarrow are seated. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons and Yarrow had been critical of the project during their campaigns, but 
that was before the developer's concessions were made public. After the 
hearing, Yarrow said he could support the project, and Emmons said it was 
"moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North will be built on the last large piece of vacant land in the 
planned city, which was incorporated in 1981. The horseshoe-shaped property 
surrounds the Valley Oaks Memorial Park cemetery. Compared to Thousand Oaks and 
Agoura Hills, Westlake Village has a relatively small commercial tax base, 
which the Westlake North development would broaden. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's original proposal was for 1.5 million square feet of commercial 
space -- including two six-story buildings -- and 400 condominiums. Before the 
hearings Wednesday and Thursday at Westlake Village City Hall, the firm cut its 
requested building height to five stories, the number of condominiums to 250 
and the total commercial square footage by 6%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest thing this city has ever seen or ever will see," said James 
B. Henderson, a 22-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the speakers at the public hearing, which was attended by an overflow 
crowd, said five-story buildings were not a fair trade for the golf course, 
which some said the developer was using as "a shotgun to our heads." 
</P>
<P>
"Four- and five-story buildings on one side of the freeway more than negate the 
golf course on the other side of the freeway," resident Allyson Hoare said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Westlake North negotiator Charles H. Fry clung to a five-story 
height limit, but on Thursday he won council support by coming down to four 
stories and by adding the driving range to the plan to preserve the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are feeling a lot better about the project if they were there last 
night," Henderson said of the meeting that concluded shortly after midnight. 
"There was negotiating going on right in front of God and everybody . . . It's 
probably about as good a deal as the city is going to get."

L.A. DISTRICT SUED FOR NOT ALLOWING TRANSFER; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A WATTS MOTHER WANTS HER SON TO GO TO A 'SAFE' SCHOOL OUTSIDE THEIR 
GANG-PLAGUED NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Watts mother of 10 has filed a federal civil rights complaint against the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for refusing to allow her son to attend a 
junior high school outside the gang-plagued neighborhood where they live. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed with the Department of Justice, alleges that the district 
violated Linda Lofton's right to "educate her child in a safe environment 
conducive to learning" when it would not bus her son away from his neighborhood 
to Nobel Junior High School in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton said she has kept her 12-year-old son, Ramon Atchison, at home since the 
beginning of the school year rather than send him to the local Charles Drew 
Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are bad, real bad," she said. "In our neighborhood there is always 
shooting. It's not safe. I just recently sent him to the store and some kids 
jumped Ramon, hit him on the head for fun and told him to 'watch your back.' I 
would love to send him to the neighborhood school, but I can't, not if I care 
about his life." 
</P>
<P>
School officials said Friday that Lofton must enroll her child in Drew before 
they can consider permitting him to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is a non-enrollee," said Charles Palmer, the district's 
administrator for the area where Lofton lives. "She simply wants to transfer 
her child without first enrolling him. State law requires that the kid has to 
be enrolled. The school in her neighborhood has never had the child there on 
campus to be able to do anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Lofton enrolls her son at Drew, he would not attend school there 
because of overcrowding, Palmer said, but would be bused to Mt. Gleason Junior 
High School in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is not what she wants," Palmer said. "She wants to pick her own 
school." 
</P>
<P>
The children of Lofton, 35, range in age from 2 to 14. Of the seven who are of 
school age, three attend Lomita Magnet School in the Harbor area and two attend 
a local elementary school. Lofton said she would prefer that Ramon, who 
graduated last year from Lomita, go to Nobel, where her eldest son, Robert 
Atchison, 14, is a student. 
</P>
<P>
Ezola Foster, chairwoman of Black Americans for Family Values, a Watts-based 
group that filed the complaint Thursday on behalf of Lofton, said the worried 
mother is like many other South-Central Los Angeles parents who have turned to 
busing as a way to save their children from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible, and when you ask the school district for help they ignore you," 
she said. "She (Lofton) has been trying since the first day of school to enroll 
her child in a safe school, but she has been insulted and ridiculed and sent 
from one office to the next in violation of her rights." 
</P>
<P>
Foster's group filed similar complaints in February on behalf of parents at 
Jordan High School in Watts, who eventually were granted transfers for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Brown, principal at Drew, said her school is no different from any other 
school in the district. "We have occasional gang problems," she said. "(But) 
most of the kids are good kids, 98% are normal kids with average everyday 
problems. Our school is safe. If it weren't safe, we wouldn't be here."

WAR OF THE WHITEFLY; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGIES: SCIENTISTS UNCORK THEIR BIOLOGICAL WEAPON AGAINST A PEST 
INFESTATION. THEY'RE PITTING TINY WASPS AGAINST TINY FLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Scientists launched the first attack in a biological war against the ash 
whitefly Friday when they placed 60 tiny parasitic wasps in a San Fernando 
Valley park. 
</P>
<P>
Perched atop ladders in Encino's Balboa Sports Center, researchers reached into 
nylon mesh bags that had been wrapped around branches of two infested trees and 
uncorked several narrow, inch-long vials containing the predators. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just taken a small step on a long journey," said Los Angeles County 
Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are hoping for marked progress by 1991 but say it will take up to 
five years to bring the whitefly under control. 
</P>
<P>
The gold and black wasps, imported from Israel, look like dust specks and are 
about half the size of a pinhead. They do not sting humans and can only 
multiply by laying their eggs within immature whiteflies. As the eggs develop, 
the growing wasps consume their host from the inside out, said Larry Bezark, a 
pest management specialist with the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The whitefly has invaded trees from the Mexican border to Sacramento since it 
was first discovered at a Van Nuys fruit stand 14 months ago. Researchers fear 
the pest, accidentally imported from Europe or the Middle East, could spread 
through most of the state by next year because it has no natural enemies here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very serious," UC Riverside entomologist Tom Bellows said as he stood 
beneath a tree infested with tens of thousands of whiteflies. "This is one of 
the most serious infestations of a foreign insect in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's controlled release, coordinated by scientists at the University of 
California, Riverside, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, 
is the first in a series of such test releases planned this month in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps will breed inside the mesh bags, enabling scientists to monitor their 
progress. In all, 300 of the wasps will be deployed in the bags this fall, with 
as many as 10,000 or more scheduled for similar tests in the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The test releases will help scientists determine if the wasp can survive the 
California winter outside the laboratory. Researchers are optimistic, noting 
that the wasps thrive under similar climatic conditions elsewhere. 
Entomologists also will be testing wasps imported from Italy, where the 
whitefly is kept under control by natural conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The white-winged pest sucks vital juices from leaves, weakening and eventually 
defoliating trees. Ash and pear trees are its most common victims, but loquat, 
pomegranate, citrus, toyon and others are also at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides have been unsuccessful for several reasons. Chemicals have a 
difficult time penetrating the waxy coat of the whitefly, and their eggs are 
difficult to reach because they are laid on the underside of leaves, Bellows 
said. Also, the sheer number of whiteflies, which Bellows estimated in the 
billions in the Los Angeles basin, make the use of pesticides impractical and 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to attempt that approach when there is such a good, 
environmentally sound alternative," Bellows said. 
</P>
<P>
Although damage so far has primarily been confined to shade trees and back-yard 
fruit trees, officials warn that the non-native pest poses a severe threat to 
the state's nursery and citrus industries. "There is a great potential for 
loss," Bellows said. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of Europe where the whitefly has gained a foothold, up to half the 
pear and apple crop has been destroyed, he said. "But we'll beat it before it 
happens here." 
</P>
<P>
Since the whitefly sucks more juice from plants than it can use, it leaves a 
sticky ooze in its wake that discolors fruit, stains patio furniture and ruins 
automobile paint. Residents throughout the basin have complained that the 
swarming pests, which stick to hair and clothing, have ruined back-yard 
barbecues, driving traditional outdoor activities inside. 
</P>
<P>
The biological control program, funded by government agencies, grower groups 
and the University of California, has cost less than $100,000 so far, Spaugy 
said. But Bellows estimates the biological control program will cost $120,000 a 
year for up to six years. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Tarzana) said Friday that he will introduce 
an urgency measure when the Legislature reconvenes in January that will provide 
$2 million over the next five years to combat the whitefly in California.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Cajon police arrested a man Wednesday in connection with the assault and 
extortion of a small-business owner that apparently involved cutting off the 
ears of the store owner's dog. 
</P>
<P>
Riadh Hallaq, 35, was booked into County Jail in downtown San Diego on charges 
of assault with a deadly weapon, extortion and felony animal abuse, jail 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hallaq reportedly entered a business in the 500 block of Jamacha Road about 10 
a.m. and threatened the owner with a handgun, police spokesman Debbie Barker 
said. Hallaq then produced a washcloth that contained the ears from a dog that 
Hallaq said belonged to the store owner, she said. Hallaq then left the store, 
Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
The store is owned by Shalkat Hallak, 55, who police believe is the brother of 
Hallaq, Barker said. Hallak told police that Hallaq demanded a 10% interest in 
his business and threatened to harm his family if the demand were not met. 
Hallak also said his dog had been missing for about a week, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Hallaq, a resident of Washington state, was arrested about two hours later by 
El Cajon police, who stopped his car on westbound Interstate 8, Barker said.

JUDGE'S RELEASE OF KIDNAPER DRAWS POLICE CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Friday ordered the release of an Oregon auto mechanic who was convicted 
of kidnaping and assaulting a prostitute, a move that drew criticism from 
police investigators who worked on the case. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge J. Perry Langford placed Glesty Waters Jr., 35, 
of Coos Bay, Ore., on five years' probation, ignoring the prosecutor's request 
for a nine-year state prison term. Langford said he does not think Waters is 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which investigated the case, 
issued a formal response, saying its members "are extremely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence shows a lack of appreciation for what the jury found to be true 
in this case," the statement says. 
</P>
<P>
On July 21, a jury convicted Waters of the January kidnaping and assault of 
Helen Ruth Toy. Waters has admitted picking up Toy in the area of 43rd and 
Delta streets in Southeast San Diego, but he denied ever harming her. 
</P>
<P>
The task force first investigated Waters in the course of looking into the 
mysterious deaths since 1985 of 42 women -- mostly prostitutes -- in San Diego 
whose bodies have been dumped in East and North County. Waters has since been 
eliminated as a suspect in those slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Langford said he did not fully believe the testimony of either Waters or Toy. 
</P>
<P>
"They each have something to hide," he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeal court Friday upheld the city of San Diego's decision to allow 
development of a 525-acre "county island" near Scripps Ranch, rejecting the 
Sierra Club's contention that the land is part of a "future urbanizing" zone 
that is off limits to construction without a vote of city residents. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal affirms a Superior Court 
decision allowing development of the parcel without a citywide election. 
</P>
<P>
The land became controversial when the Sierra Club and San Diegans for Managed 
Growth, the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit, began secret negotiations in June to 
drop the legal action in return for a $500,000 payment from the parcel's 
developers. The Donald L. Bren Co. and the Brennan Katkov Development Corp. 
plan more than 600 homes on some of the land. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement negotiations were dropped when news reports about them brought 
outrage from environmentalists, who contended that the two groups were selling 
out their principles, and from builders concerned about setting a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit centered on differing boundaries drawn on two different city 
planning maps and which map controls development policy.

<P>
A 22-year-old San Diego video store owner was arrested Thursday on suspicion of 
hiring two men to set fire to his business, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Phuc Van was the third man to be arrested in connection with the Nov. 8 
blaze at VP Video on Mesa College Drive. When Van went to the Metro Arson 
Strike Team's downtown headquarters to get a copy of the fire report at 5:40 
p.m., he was taken into custody, a fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt he was responsible for hiring two people to burn his business," said 
John Buono, a team investigator. Van was taken to County Jail, where bail was 
set at $50,000, Buono said. 
</P>
<P>
The other two men in custody are from Orange County. They were arrested Tuesday 
and were treated for burns suffered when the blaze started. They are at the UC 
San Diego burn unit under police protection, Buono said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance fraud is the suspected motive for the fire that caused $135,000 
damage, Buono said.

SOCKERS USE JUST ENOUGH TO STAY IN FRONT OF STORM 
</P>

<P>
Sockers Friday night played like a guy who doesn't want to beat his kid brother 
too badly in a foot race. They kept taking these big leads, and then they would 
sort of slow down and let the St. Louis Storm catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Call it pacing. Call it a collective mental lapse. Call it anything you want, 
but give them this. It worked. The Sockers (3-2) finally pulled away for good 
and defeated the Storm, 7-4, at the San Diego Sports Arena. In the process, 
they gave the 7,487 in attendance a lot to shout about. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little bit lax defensively," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. 
"Sometimes we thought we were going to score goals much easier and we didn't 
tighten up quite well enough in the back." 
</P>
<P>
The night ended on a sour note, with three Storm players being sent to Sharp 
Cabrillo Hospital by ambulance to have injuries checked: Gary Heale (bruised 
ribs), Gus Mokalis (medial collateral) and Claudio De Oliveira (dislocated 
shoulder). 
</P>
<P>
The game bounced along like this: 
</P>
<P>
First the Sockers led, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
St Louis (1-5) made it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Sockers led, 5-2. By then, midfielder Jacques Ladouceur had scored two 
goals for the first time since Jan. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, St. Louis made it 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Socker defender Ralph Black scored his second goal of the season with 
6:45 remaining in the third quarter. Midfielder Rod Castro added his second 
goal of the game 8:30 into the fourth quarter. A bit of running around 
followed, and soon the Sockers had their second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is fond of saying he likes to get new faces in the lineup to keep the 
veterans hungry. Ladouceur is sort of a new face. Castro is a true one. 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur played four seasons with the Sockers before taking last year off to 
run his own network marketing business. Castro is fresh off a 55-goal season 
with Memphis Storm of the American Indoor Soccer Assn. He likes these Major 
Indoor Soccer League crowds a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It psyches me up," he said. "In Memphis we averaged less than 2,000 a game, so 
it was a little bit of a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Castro opened the scoring 59 seconds into Friday's game, taking a pass from 
midfielder Brian Quinn and quickly releasing a shot that traveled into the left 
corner of the Storm goal. Castro has been dubbed "The Rocket" since his arrival 
in San Diego. He's not sure how he got the name, but guesses that one of the 
television announcers meant to call him a rookie and said "Rocket" instead. 
Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur's goals gave the Sockers leads of 2-0 and 5-2 in the first half. His 
first goal came with 10:48 remaining in the first quarter, following Castro's 
goal. Waad Hrimez advanced the ball down the middle of the carpet and passed 
left. By that time, Ladouceur had gotten behind Storm defender Diego Mandagaran 
and sent the ball into the right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter, Segota flew by former Socker Fernando 
Clavijo to meet a Kevin Crow pass, score and give the Sockers a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis closed to within 3-2 before the quarter ended on goals from Thompson 
Usiyan (3:37) and Godfrey Ingram (2:06). 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur got back into the act with 9:55 remaining in the half, taking a 
crossing pass from Zoran Karic and punching it by Storm goalie David Brcic, who 
has started all but one game over veteran Slobo Ilijevski. Passing up the shot 
in favor of an assist indicates Karic has matured since last year, when earned 
a reputation for being somewhat selfish. 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur is glad to be back, and he's more relaxed after establishing himself 
in the business world. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun doing what I was doing," he said. "Coming back now is just 
an added boost. Before I was concerned about the future. Now I think I'm pretty 
much set." 
</P>
<P>
George Fernandez closed the first-half scoring, taking a pass from Steve Zungul 
just inside the redline and drilling a low shot by Brcic. St. Louis made it's 
second and final run early in the third quarter when defender Emil Dragicevic 
(12:46) and midfielder Thompson Usiyan (11:12) scored. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good players, but inexperience cost us the game," Storm Coach Don 
Popovic said. "We still have some guys who have never played indoors." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker midfielder Waad Hirmez appeared on the radio Thursday with Dennis 
McKnight, a center/guard for the Chargers, to promote a holiday season food 
drive. McKnight was giving Hirmez a bad time about the pictures Hirmez brought 
to autograph, which were black and white. McKnight's were color. So Hirmez shot 
back: "Show me how many championship rings you have." He has you there, Dennis. 
. . . Forward Damir Haramina (thigh) and midfielder Ben Collins (thigh) did not 
suit up Friday and are not expected to play tonight against Tacoma. . . . The 
Sockers were just 5-9 last season in second games of a back-to-back series. "I 
don't think we have enough players who can suck it up and play hard for the 
second game," defender Kevin Crow said. "You should be able to suck it up for 
one game." . . . Midfielder Branko Segota would have had four goals in Sunday's 
6-2 victory over Dallas if he had been successful on a third-quarter shootout. 
The Sockers are now 0-2 in shootouts this season.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO PLANS TO CALYPSO ON ROAD TO ITALY

<P>
When we catch them in the Stadium, 
</P>
<P>
 We'll beat them like a bongo drum, 
</P>
<P>
 We go show them Yankee who is gnat, 
</P>
<P>
 Soca tempo, tit for tat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Blue Boy, calypso singer, "The Road to Italy" 
</P>
<P>
It was Sunday, the first day of Winners Week in Trinidad and Tobago. The letter 
W was for Worship, which is what an interfaith congregation had come to do at 
the Holy Trinity Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their religion -- Christian, Muslim or Hindu -- the faithful had been 
taught not to trivialize their prayers. So, usually, they pray for fresh water 
from the skies, oil from beneath the ocean and good weather for the fruit and 
sugar cane harvests. 
</P>
<P>
But these are not usual times on these tiny Caribbean islands. On this 
particular day, they had come to pray for victory for their Trinidad and Tobago 
(T&amp;T) national soccer team in its game at the National Stadium Sunday 
against the colossus from the north, the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, all T&amp;T needs is a tie to advance with 23 other countries to the 
World Cup next year in Italy for the first time in. The United States needs a 
victory to earn a place in the finals for the first time since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone in the congregation felt guilty about praying to win a soccer game, 
he or she would have received absolution from Archbishop Anthony Pantin. He 
told them he had prayed in the dressing room with the national team before an 
exhibition game the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was praying for the nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was the day for Initiative. At 3:30 p.m., the time of Sunday's game, 
people were asked to interrupt whatever they were doing to honk their horns, 
wave the flag or sing the national anthem. If they did not know the words to 
the anthem, a calypso song would do. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 on the hit parade this week has been Blue Boy's "The Road to Italy." It 
can be found on his "Super Blue" album, which has the Jules Rimet World Cup 
trophy on the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was for honoring past National Heroes, such as the country's only 
Olympic gold medalist, 1976 100-meter track champion Hasely Crawford, and 
author V.S. Naipaul. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was Never Say Never Day. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Energy Day, about 6,000 school children were bused to the National 
Stadium for a pep rally. As they danced and sang and chanted, they were 
entertained by steel and oil bands, tassa drumming and calypso singers, 
including, of course, Blue Boy, who borrowed a melody from a religious anthem. 
Archbishop Pantin, no doubt, will recommend that he be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 "When T&amp;T, When T&amp;T, 
</P>
<P>
 "Goes on to Rome, 
</P>
<P>
 "I will like to be in that number, 
</P>
<P>
 "When T&amp;T goes on to Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm reached a new high Friday, Red Day, when everyone on both islands 
was supposed to wear the national color. From the look of things at Port of 
Spain's busiest corner, Henry and Queens, everyone did. With music blaring from 
every storefront, traffic stopped at noon as people spent their lunch hour 
dancing in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper editorial cautioned its readers not to presume that those not 
wearing red are traitors. It pointed out that some less-fortunate islanders 
simply do not have red garments. But that seems unlikely after this week. On 
Wednesday alone, the T&amp;T Football Assn. (TTFA), sold $34,000 ($8,100 U.S.) 
worth of souvenirs, mostly red T-shirts, bicycle caps and scarfs. 
</P>
<P>
Even newspaper headlines Friday were in red. 
</P>
<P>
"Red or Dead," said the Evening News. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Dawn," said the Daily Express. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood in the Mud," said the Bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, the Guardian, said that the significance of Sunday's game 
cannot be underestimated. So far, no one here has tried. 
</P>
<P>
One writer in the Guardian called it "arguably the greatest moment in the 
history of Trinidad and Tobago." Other newspaper, radio and television 
commentators have expressed hope that a victory will enhance the country's 
standing in the Organization of American States and boost the economy by 
stimulating trade and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
In short, they have said, a victory would put T&amp;T on the map. The islands, 
incidentally, are located off the northeast tip of Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people will have their eyes on Trinidad and Tobago," Archbishop 
Pantin told his congregation. "They will perhaps find out for the first time 
that we are not part of Jamaica." 
</P>
<P>
Expectations are so high that Dr. Harry Maharnj, a consultant psychiatrist at 
St. Ann's Hospital, said the stadium Sunday could become a time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"With the national psyche so aroused, I am worried that anything remotely 
inconsistent with what is expected on the day can trigger mass hysteria," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are now living for something, which I think is very positive. But 
we are too psyched up, too prepared for this expectant success that, should we 
fail, thousands will suffer a huge emotional letdown. All hell could break 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore -- "Call me, Bones" -- Augustus, an assistant in the TTFA office, said 
the doctor needs a shrink. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, we will be upset for a day," he said. "No one will go to work 
Monday. But we are a very easygoing people, and we will get over it soon. We 
have Christmas to look forward to, then Carnival in February, then Easter. 
There is always something." 
</P>
<P>
But, Bones added, it is a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is the virtually unanimous consensus on the islands, although T&amp;T has 
not beaten the United States in eight meetings since 1982. They tied, 1-1, in 
Torrance earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The leading headline one day this week on the front page of the Guardian (that 
is the front page of the newspaper, not the sports section), said, "No Way 
USA." 
</P>
<P>
From a sporting standpoint, the immediate impact of a tie or a victory Sunday 
for the home team would be to make Trinidad and Tobago, with a combined 
population of 1.26 million, the smallest country ever to advance to the World 
Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a staggering accomplishment considering that the TTFA almost 
ceased to exist earlier this decade. Between 1983 and '86, a rival group, the 
T&amp;T Football Federation, attempted a hostile takeover of soccer on the 
islands. It had the support of the ruling party, the People's National 
Movement, but it was not sanctioned by the International Federation of 
Association Football (FIFA). 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, another party, the National Alliance for Reconstruction, came into 
power and threw its weight behind the TTFA. That was the end of the upstart 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
One of TTFA General Secretary Jack Warner's proudest moments this week was when 
the former federation chairman, Arthur Suite, came with hat in hand to the 
association office to ask if he could buy tickets for the game. Warner gave him 
two free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the TTFA won the war, its balanced budget was a casualty. Warner said 
he was humiliated when he felt compelled to sell a home game to the United 
States in the 1985 World Cup qualifying tournament, taking $20,000 to play in 
Torrance instead of Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not out of patriotism that we are still in the red," Warner joked, 
noting that the TTFA still owes $500,000 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
With a victory Sunday, the TTFA's financial prospectus would improve 
significantly. FIFA guarantees $1.4 million to each of the 24 finalists in the 
World Cup. Furthermore, local companies are lining up to sponsor the team and 
individual players if they reach Italy. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the TTFA's most generous benefactor has been the government. The 
National Alliance for Reconstruction has not been able to turn around an 
economy devastated by the decrease in oil prices, but it has scored points with 
its constituency by providing for the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Besides donating about $100,000 earlier this year, the government also has 
helped by putting the coaching staff and a psychologist on its payroll and 
providing the National Stadium rent free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calypso football at its best, 
</P>
<P>
 "T&amp;T versus the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The real hero of T&amp;T's emergence in international soccer is its coach, 
Everald (Gally) Cummings, 41, who was on the national team at 16, then played 
in the now-defunct North American Soccer League a few years before returning 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, after the national team lost all three games at the Pan American Games 
in Indianapolis, he was asked to become its coach. The first thing he did was 
give the team a national identity. 
</P>
<P>
A British colony until 1962, T&amp;T was still playing a style heavily 
influenced by Englishmen who coached on the islands years before. Their style 
featured long balls down the wings and crosses to target men. Cummings decided 
to stress individual one-on-one skills but with structure. He looked toward 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we had a lot in common with the Brazilian people in cultural terms -- a 
mixture of races, music, football played in poverty areas and on the beach, the 
desire of young boys to become star players," he told Soccer America earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the player must be a mirror of the people in his society. 
It must reflect the people and the things that make T&amp;T the place that it 
is -- our calypso music, our carnivals." 
</P>
<P>
Cummings' players have made such beautiful music that their style is called, 
"Calypso football." 
</P>
<P>
Their record in the Central and North American and Caribbean region (CONCACAF) 
qualifying tournament is 3-1-3. The United States has the same record, but 
T&amp;T has the advantage in case of a tie Sunday because of a better goal 
differential. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely is anything resembling a negative word heard about the team on the 
islands. T&amp;T is known as the Rainbow Country because of the many different 
nationalities and ethnic groups that live here in harmony. Some East Indians 
have complained because only blacks are on the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
But the primary complaint from most islanders is that they cannot get tickets 
for the game in the 30,000-seat stadium. The match will be televised live and 
also shown on Diamond Vision at three locations on Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not imagine how many old ladies are backing the team now, although 
some of them don't know football from cricket," Archbishop Pantin said. 
</P>
<P>
T&amp;T was this close to qualifying for the World Cup finals once before, in 
1973. But in a decisive game in Haiti, four T&amp;T goals were called back in a 
2-1 loss. Afterward, the referee and the linesman were banned for life by FIFA, 
but the result stood. 
</P>
<P>
So there is good reason that TTFA officials are paranoid about Sunday's game. 
Although there is no history of soccer violence here, 1,200 soldiers and 700 
policemen have been enlisted to make sure that no one among the capacity crowd 
does anything that would lead to a U.S. protest. That is a larger security 
force than the island had for visits by Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
"Behave . . . or Else," a headline in the Guardian warned. 
</P>
<P>
But after the game, if T&amp;T wins, all bets are off. The police chief has 
denied permission for a jump-up, which is the dancing in the streets that 
islanders do during the annual Carnival. That, however, does not mean there 
will be no jump-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the police are against it," said Peter O'Connor, president of 
the TTFA. "They can't very well say that it's OK for people to dance and drink 
in the streets. It's just going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "The streets like ah festival, 
</P>
<P>
 "People making bacchanal, 
</P>
<P>
 "East, west, north and south, 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord, hear they mouth, 
</P>
<P>
 "People jumping half-naked, 
</P>
<P>
 "and sipping dey Carib. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the road, on the road, 
</P>
<P>
 "The road to Italy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad and Tobago are separate islands that have been influenced by cultures 
from Europe, Africa and Asia since growth there began in the 18th Century -- 
Christopher Columbus claimed Trinidad for Spain in 1498 -- but they have been 
paired only since 1888, when they became a single colony under British rule. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression of the 1930s, the colony suffered serious economic 
problems and the people demanded greater voice in the government. Gradual 
increases in self-government were allowed in the 1940s and '50s, and the colony 
became an independent republic in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad, the larger of the islands, lies seven miles east of Venezuela. It 
accounts for about 95% of the land area and 95% of the population, much of it 
centered in Port of Spain, a major seaport. Tobago is about 20 miles northeast 
of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is based on oil production but agriculture and tourism 
also play major roles, and the country is particularly noted for steel drum 
bands, calypso music and the limbo dance.

UNION MIGHT ACT ON CLAIRE'S CALL; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSN. SAYS DISCLOSURE TO MEDIA OF CONTRACT OFFER 
TO VALENZUELA MAY INDICATE COLLUSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' disclosure of their contract offer to free-agent pitcher Fernando 
Valenzuela has left the Major League Players Assn. concerned that collusion 
still exists. And the union says it is prepared to take immediate action 
designed to stop the clubs from exchanging information on free-agent offers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely unfortunate and extremely inappropriate," Don Fehr, the 
union's executive director, said Friday. "And if Fernando has been damaged -- 
as we think he has -- then steps will be taken to rectify the damage, either 
individually or as part of a broader action." 
</P>
<P>
A broader action would be filing a grievance on behalf of all free agents 
accusing the clubs of violating the collective bargaining agreement by 
negotiating in concert. In other words: Collusion IV. 
</P>
<P>
The players' union also could file strictly on Valenzuela's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr refused to speculate on his ultimate course but said he would lodge an 
immediate complaint with the owners' Player Relations Committee and arbitrator 
George Nicolau, who is presiding over the Collusion II and III cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was an isolated incident, we might look on it in different terms, but 
the clubs aren't exactly operating from a clean slate," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this is exactly the type of collusive action that we didn't think we'd 
see this time. It's inappropriate and ought to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
How was Valenzuela damaged by the Dodgers' revelation that they have offered 
him $1.5 million for 1990 and an option at the same figure in 1991, with a 
$350,000 buyout if they didn't pick up the option? 
</P>
<P>
Dick Moss, who is Valenzuela's attorney and works in conjunction with agent 
Tony DeMarco, put it this way: "By going public with their 'low-ball' offer, 
the Dodgers are saying to other clubs, 'Look, this is all you have to beat.' It 
inhibits Fernando's ability to function as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's improper behavior, and we're very angry about it. A general manager from 
another club even told me that he thought it was dirty pool." 
</P>
<P>
Moss and Fehr both said they viewed the Dodger action as a response to the 
owners' committee's elimination of last year's information bank, the process by 
which clubs filed all of their free-agent offers with a central office, which 
then made them available to other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
With this process, negotiations were often conducted in incremental rather than 
sweeping steps. And that was a basis for the union grievance now known as 
Collusion III. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rona, the Player Relations Committee's executive director, said Friday 
that the information bank was created to help turn a frigid market competitive 
after the clubs lost Collusion I. It was dismantled, he said, because of the 
union's continued hostility to it, and the fact that it served its purpose, 
helping to restore competitiveness to the free-agent market last winter, a 
competitiveness that he said seems apparent again. 
</P>
<P>
Rona cited the San Francisco Giants' signing of Houston Astro outfielder Kevin 
Bass for three years at a total of $5.25 million Thursday and the Atlanta 
Braves' signing of Boston Red Sox first baseman Nick Esasky for three years at 
a total of $5.7 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, however, said the Dodgers had violated the clubs' own directive about 
exchanging information and had done it flagrantly in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Be it a boycott, price-fixing or an information bank, there have been many 
forms of collusion, and this seems to be another," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, revealed details of the 
Valenzuela offer Tuesday in a conference call to reporters who cover the club. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, quoting DeMarco, had reported in Tuesday's editions that the Dodgers 
had extended their one-year offer to include an option year. The $1.5-million 
offer for 1990 had been reported previously in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said Friday that it is his policy to negotiate privately, but since some 
of the details -- including Valenzuela's request for a three-year, $6-million 
contract -- had been published in The Times Tuesday and obviously released by 
Valenzuela's representatives, he decided "it might as well all be there and be 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Informed of the response by Moss and Fehr, Claire said: "My reaction to that is 
one of surprise. I wasn't exchanging information with other clubs, merely 
confirming what had already been said, what was already there in print. The 
information was already out. I mean, all of this comes under the heading of 
what we're trying to accomplish, and what we're still trying to accomplish is 
to sign Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
Rona, reached in New York, dismissed the grievance threat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency on the part of many agents to carry their negotiations into 
the media in the belief that it creates pressure on the club," he said. "No 
matter what you think of that, it's certainly appropriate for the club to 
defend itself by responding with the total and accurate story." 
</P>
<P>
The lines of communication between Valenzuela and the Dodgers remain open, 
Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Has Valenzuela heard from any other clubs? 
</P>
<P>
"Some have called to lay a little groundwork, but most of the clubs that need 
pitching are following a similar course," Moss said. "They say they're 
interested but have to sort out their position with Mark Langston first." 
</P>
<P>
Langston and agent Arn Tellem met with representatives of the San Diego Padres 
in Los Angeles Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tellem said that his meetings, to this point, have been general in nature, 
designed to inform Langston about the respective teams and organizations and 
lay the groundwork for ensuing negotiations. Those will begin Monday, with the 
Dodgers and Angels among the first to bargain.

THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE, BUT IT'S STILL USC-UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
USC vs. UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Say it and you need say no more. 
</P>
<P>
The images flow: O.J. for 64 yards, Gary Beban to Kurt Altenberg, George Achica 
blocking a kick, Frank Jordan getting his kick, Jay Schroeder to Freeman 
McNeil, Erik Affholter's juggling catch . . . 
</P>
<P>
National championships and unbeaten records, Rose Bowls and Heisman Trophies -- 
they've all been at stake in this storied rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
And now, today, it's USC vs. UCLA at the Coliseum for, ta-da, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely nothing. The Trojans are already assured of going to the Rose Bowl, 
and the Bruins are going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, city bragging rights will be on the line. And a chance for UCLA to 
salvage at least a modicum of respect from its worst season in nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are 3-7. Improving to 4-7 wouldn't begin to right all the wrongs, 
but a victory over the Trojans would at least allow the graduating seniors to 
leave with a good taste in their mouths and begin the healing process for those 
returning. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the bowl picture after eight consecutive postseason appearances, the 
Bruins will have to make this their bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
As for USC, 8-2 and eighth-ranked in the nation, it has been a season with two 
goals from the start. 
</P>
<P>
The first, a victory over Notre Dame, never happened. The opportunity for the 
second, a victory in the Rose Bowl after two consecutive losing appearances, 
lies ahead after last week's Pacific 10 Conference title-clinching win over 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
In between sits UCLA, a 16 1/2-point underdog, but in position to pull an 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a game for pride," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "And the tradition, and 
just the fact it's SC and UCLA week. 
</P>
<P>
"This would make their whole season. If we sit back and are satisfied and happy 
and all that kind of stuff with what we've achieved, then we'll get our brains 
beat out. To me, it's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
To UCLA Coach Terry Donahue -- stuck in a five-game losing streak, longest by a 
Bruin team in one season since 1963 -- there is nothing simple about beating 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, our team is going to have to play the best it's played all year, by 
a longshot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Bruins do so, linebacker Marvcus Patton thinks it would soothe some 
of the hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The record will always be there," he said. "But we could say we beat SC. Two 
of the most successful (Bruin) teams in the school's history didn't beat them 
the last two years, so if we beat them this year, it will make our season." 
</P>
<P>
This is a game that traditionally pits old friends and high school rivals 
against each other, and today is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable confrontation involves the starting quarterbacks, Todd 
Marinovich of USC and Bret Johnson of UCLA, rivals since their prep days in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, a redshirt freshman, seems to be enjoying all the cross-town talk. 
He showed up for a meeting with reporters at USC Tuesday wearing a light blue 
shirt and gold pants, the Bruin colors. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his choice of clothes was more than just coincidence, he smiled, 
shrugged and said, "Nope, just feel comfortable in them." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich has been comfortable from the start in a job handed to him 10 days 
before the season opener when starter Pat O'Hara went down from a season-ending 
leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
With 2,246 yards passing, Marinovich is only the fourth Trojan -- Rodney Peete, 
Paul McDonald and Rob Hertel were the others -- to pass for for more than 2,000 
in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said: "He has the benefit of being on a very dominant defensive team, 
which allows him tremendous flexibility and allows him tremendous breathing 
room. You know that if things misfire, your defensive team can get you off the 
hook." 
</P>
<P>
That it can. USC leads the nation in rushing defense, allowing an average of 
just 62.5 yards a game. And only Notre Dame has scored against it on the 
ground, the Irish getting four touchdowns rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, on the other hand, has been part of a team unable to hold anybody back 
recently. The Bruins have led or been tied in the second half of each of their 
last four games before losing. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hasn't led his club to a second-half touchdown in its last six games. 
Donahue has pulled him in three of the last four and handed the controls to 
sophomore Jim Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Will he do the same today? 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how the game goes," Donahue said. "But I would say we wouldn't 
hesitate to use him." 
</P>
<P>
The repeated collapses seem to have mentally drained the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this year, we played with a lot of emotion," Patton said. "We had guys 
who got out there and were pumped up and fired up. This year, there's not a lot 
to be fired up about." 
</P>
<P>
There is today. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan-Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
All 92,516 seats have been sold for today's game. The kickoff is scheduled for 
12:30 p.m. . . . The last time the Bruins had a losing record, the Trojans beat 
them, 49-14. That was a decade ago. "In 1979, we ran out of players during the 
game," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "In 1989, we're having difficulty before 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, three Bruin defensive players have been suspended for 
disciplinary reasons, another left the team after being arrested, and another 
flunked out of school. In addition, defensive tackle Bryan Wilcox left the team 
in midseason because of a head injury; offensive guard Lance Zeno had an 
appendectomy two weeks ago; Reggie Moore had knee surgery three weeks ago, and 
Paul Richardson will be out with a pulled groin, leaving the Bruins without two 
of their top four wide receivers. Nose tackle Brian Kelly is out with a knee 
injury and will be replaced by Jon Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Kevin Williams, who sprained an arch three weeks ago and carried the 
ball only twice last week against Oregon, is expected to start at tailback for 
UCLA. . . . Trojan defensive back Cleveland Colter, who underwent knee surgery 
at the end of last season, had to have fluid drained from the knee earlier this 
week but will start. . . . UCLA receiver Mike Farr needs six receptions to 
break Mike Sherrard's school record of 128 career catches. Farr hasn't caught 
more than five in any game this season but had nine receptions in last year's 
game against USC. 
</P>
<P>
In the annual Blood Bowl Friday between staff members of the school's student 
newspapers, the Daily Bruin beat the Daily Trojan, 14-8, at USC's intramural 
field. According to tradition, the school that wins the Blood Bowl usually 
loses in the real game.

A BRIGHT MOON CONTINUES TO RISE; 
</P>
<P>
OILERS: HE HAS BEEN REJECTED AND DEJECTED, BUT NOW SOME ARE CALLING HIM THE 
BEST QUARTERBACK IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Quarterback Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers drops back to pass and is 
immediately assaulted by the Cincinnati Bengals' defense. It looks as if he 
will be sacked. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. 
</P>
<P>
Moon escapes the grasp of a defender and runs 10 yards for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
Then, facing a blitz, Moon rolls left and throws right, a perfect strike to 
Drew Hill, just before being engulfed by defenders. 
</P>
<P>
On the Oilers' next possession, Moon surveys the field after taking the snap. 
Seeing his primary receiver covered, he drills another pass to Hill, putting 
the Oilers in position to score. 
</P>
<P>
Moon then fires a touchdown pass to Ernest Givins. 
</P>
<P>
Moon is having his best season since coming to the Oilers from the Edmonton 
Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in 1984. He is No. 1 on the roster and 
No. 1 in the hearts of Oiler faithful. 
</P>
<P>
With a 91.7 quarterback ranking, third best in the AFC behind Jim Kelly of 
Buffalo and Boomer Esiason of Cincinnati, Moon has passed for 2,453 yards and 
15 touchdowns. He has thrown for more than 200 yards in eight of his last nine 
games going into Sunday's matchup against the Raiders in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville said this week: "He's more than a quarterback. He's 
more than a passer. We ought to put a new title in the program for him. He does 
it all." 
</P>
<P>
Although Randall Cunningham of the Philadelphia Eagles is hailed as the new 
prototype quarterback, Moon has quietly eclipsed him. 
</P>
<P>
Is Moon competing statistically against Cunningham? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Moon said. "For one, we're in different conferences and we never 
play against each other. I'm happy for whatever success he's having. I'm happy 
for whatever success any (other) black quarterbacks have because it's only 
going to help out all the younger guys coming along." 
</P>
<P>
As one of the NFL's pioneer black quarterbacks, does Moon feel accepted now? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've been accepted pretty well throughout the league," Moon said. "As 
I improved, you started not to hear the word black put in front of quarterback 
all the time. And now I'm pretty much recognized as just another quarterback in 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
Moon, however, wasn't even drafted when he left the University of Washington in 
1978. There's no way that could happen in today's enlightened age, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," Moon said. "Rodney Peete should have been a top pick in the 
draft. He had everything going for him that you need coming out of (USC). He 
was a winner. He's got smarts. He's got a good arm. He might not have been as 
tall as a lot of people might like, but he's tall enough. You've got other 
quarterbacks who went higher than he did who are not as tall. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I'm more disappointed in, in the NFL (attitude) about black 
quarterbacks, is that if you're not a guy who they think can come out of 
college and play right now, most teams aren't willing to put the time into you 
to groom you for the future." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Moon entered the game, Hamilton High's B team had a 40-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The third-string quarterback launched an 80-yard pass, overthrowing his 
receiver but impressing Jack Epstein, then the Hamilton varsity coach, who was 
watching from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll remember that pass until the day I die," Epstein said. "He was just a 
little skinny kid and he threw that ball so hard there was smoke coming off the 
back of the ball. The ball went about a mile over the receiver's head." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein approached Moon after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that he was going to be the quarterback on the varsity next year," 
Epstein said. "His chest puffed out and his eyes got big as hell." 
</P>
<P>
After taking over as varsity quarterback, Moon led Hamilton to the 1973 City 
playoffs as a senior and was named to the All-City team. 
</P>
<P>
But recruiters weren't interested in him because he was only 5-11 and 165 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to sell UCLA on him, but they were running the option and they thought 
he was too small," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
After Epstein left to become offensive coordinator at West Los Angeles College, 
Moon followed. 
</P>
<P>
Moon flourished at West L.A. where he was named the Western State Conference 
player of the year as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the attention of Washington Coach Don James, but he was reluctant to 
recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I said there was no way that we were going to ever take a freshman out of 
junior college unless we got absolute permission to recruit him," James said. 
Epstein gave his permission, and the Huskies signed Moon. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moon was apprehensive about attending a college that had racial 
tension on its football team under the previous coach, Jim Owens, Epstein 
assured him that it would be different under James. 
</P>
<P>
One Saturday in Seattle, Moon was serenaded with boos as soon as he emerged 
from the tunnel at Husky Stadium. The booing became so loud that it drowned out 
his signals. 
</P>
<P>
Washington fans jeered Moon with racial slurs. They were angry with him because 
the team was stumbling to a 5-6 record in his second season as the starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a big question whether they were booing the guy because he was 
the quarterback and we weren't winning, or whether they were booing him because 
he was black," James said. "I'm sure they were tough times for Warren to go 
through. But we tried to tell him constantly that it had nothing to do with 
race, that it was football USA and it happens in every town. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it did bother him. It was really grim at times. But Warren was a real 
gentleman. He didn't lash out at any of the fans publicly. He took everything 
he got and he turned around and got more determined to prove that he was a good 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Was Moon disturbed by the booing? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," he said. "When you're 18 and you've never been away from home and 
suddenly 60,000 people are booing you and blaming the whole football game on 
you, it's quite a shock. But I learned a lot from that experience, and because 
it happened to me at such a young age, I think I learned how to deal with 
adversity as I got older." 
</P>
<P>
After the Huskies started 2-2 in 1977, James stuck with Moon despite the calls 
for him to change quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off as Moon led the Huskies to the conference championship and a 
win over Michigan in the 1978 Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was named the Pacific 8 player of the year after passing for 1,584 yards 
and 11 touchdowns as a senior. He passed for 3,277 yards and 19 touchdowns in 
his collegiate career. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moon managed to win over Washington's fans, he failed to win over 
skeptical NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Moon headed north, signing with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football 
League before the '78 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotype was that he was a black quarterback and he was going to run 
around like a madman, but he wouldn't be able to throw very well," said 
Edmonton General Manager Hugh Campbell, who coached Moon for five years in 
Edmonton and two in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, however, did not fit the stereotype. He passed for 21,228 yards in his 
six CFL seasons, and the Eskimos won five consecutive Grey Cup championships. 
</P>
<P>
"The time he spent in Edmonton was important," Campbell said. "If he'd gone 
straight to the NFL, it might have been a different story, not as happy a story 
and not as financially rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Moon was rewarded when he went to the NFL in 1984, becoming the league's 
highest-paid quarterback with a $5.5-million, five-year contract. He signed a 
new $10-million, five-year contract last April. 
</P>
<P>
With the Seattle Seahawks also trying to sign Moon in '84, the Oilers hired 
Campbell to coach the team because they thought Moon would follow him. And they 
were right. 
</P>
<P>
"When Warren came to Houston, there was no question in any of our minds that he 
was one of the top 10 quarterbacks in the NFL," Campbell said. "We just didn't 
have the players to go with him." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers struggled in Moon's first two seasons, compiling an 8-24 record, and 
Campbell was fired with two games left in the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the Oilers "deceitfully misled" him, hiring him because of his 
relationship with Moon and not on his own merits. 
</P>
<P>
Moon said: "When Hugh got fired, I was really down and out because . . . I was 
told before I got here that he would be given three years to help build this 
team. He was cleaning house of a lot of old players and bringing in a lot of 
new players. We didn't have a whole lot of talent when I first got here, and it 
seemed like they wanted things to happen a little bit quicker than (in a) 
three-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know where I fit into those plans once he got fired because a lot of 
what we were going to try and do were things we had done before in Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Moon clashed with Glanville, who succeeded Campbell. The quarterback wanted to 
pass, and the coach wanted to run. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry came in with his own philosophy, and I didn't think I fit into that 
philosophy," Moon said. "I was very unhappy for about a year and a half here 
because I felt like I was just handing the football off and not really being 
taken advantage of, as far as my skills were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"But we sat down at the end of his first year and had a talk about offensive 
philosophy and how I fit into what we were doing, and we opened up from that 
point on." 
</P>
<P>
Moon has thrown for 8,622 yards and 51 touchdowns in his last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said: "I'm a great fan of (San Francisco 49er quarterback) Joe Montana 
and I'm not trying to say anything sacrilegious, but I believe that Warren is 
the absolute best." 
</P>
<P>
It helped that the Oilers let Moon call his own plays. Perhaps no other 
quarterback in the NFL calls more plays than Moon. But winning his freedom from 
Glanville's conservative play-calling wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Moon criticized Glanville for calling too many running plays after the Oilers 
got off to a 1-8 start in 1986. Glanville responded by turning over the offense 
to Moon, and Houston won four of its last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers have finished second in the AFC Central Division the last two 
seasons but have been eliminated in the divisional playoffs, a trend they hope 
to halt this time around.

MCDONALD NOW PLAYING SAFETY FIRST; 
</P>
<P>
CARDINALS: FORMER USC DEFENSIVE BACK WARMS TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Phoenix Cardinals play the Rams Sunday in Anaheim, but they won't arrive in 
time for Tim McDonald to make it to today's USC-UCLA game. So the former Trojan 
safety will watch the game on television and wax nostalgic about the good old 
college days. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that McDonald misses the pals-parties-and-pranks stuff that much. What 
he yearns for is the time when he roamed free in the defensive backfield, 
slamming his body into ball carriers and receivers whenever and wherever he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The pro game is just too darned disciplined. A strong safety actually has 
specific responsibilities that go beyond simple mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you feel like a robot," McDonald said. "Everybody has a 
responsibility on every play. You're responsible for a certain area and you 
have to do that job first before you can do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Mind-boggling, huh? 
</P>
<P>
Making tackles and batting down passes just aren't enough, anymore. Consider 
McDonald's list of duties: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First, he has to call out adjustments for the secondary before every snap. 
That may be a nuisance, but at least it doesn't keep him out of any action. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then, he has to make sure the opponent isn't going to run a sweep his way. 
If it does, he has to force the play inside. No fun, unless they run at him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In man-to-man pass coverage, he has to stick with one running back or tight 
end. Heck, there's a good chance the guy might not even be the primary 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And a few times a game, the Cardinals let him blitz. Rushing the 
quarterback, of course, is always fun. For McDonald, that is. 
</P>
<P>
It can be considerably less pleasant for the quarterback. Just ask Ram backup 
Mark Herrmann, who was out for more than a month with broken ribs after 
McDonald sacked him in the third game of the exhibition season this year. 
</P>
<P>
To say McDonald lives for Sunday afternoons is to understate this 24-year-old's 
love affair with football. The sight of a vulnerable receiver, stretching out 
for a pass within striking distance is McDonald's idea of an adrenaline rush. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty quiet off the field, but when I'm out there on the field, I hate 
the enemy," he said. "Sometimes, I want to rip a guy's head off. Sometimes, I 
get so, uh, energized, that I do things I regret later. 
</P>
<P>
"But, hey, I'm just out there trying to win." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald admits that problems arise on Sundays because he has trouble dealing 
with all the specific roles the Cardinal coaches keep calmly explaining to him 
every week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt like I have lots of athletic ability," he says. "And I wanted 
to be able to move around and do some things to show it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at SC, I pretty much ran around and did what I wanted. I could be 
here, be there, just make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Deep down, McDonald knows that football comes down to just making the plays. So 
he has managed to rampage within this think-and-react regimen, balancing on the 
thin line between staying in the system and spinning out of control. 
</P>
<P>
And he leads the National Football League with six interceptions, four in the 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Stallings spent more than a quarter of a century learning football from 
Bear Bryant and then Tom Landry. He was the Cowboys' defensive backfield coach 
during three trips to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So you have to understand that this from the coach of the Cardinals is not a 
simple statement of fact, but the ultimate compliment: "Tim McDonald is a 
football player, in my opinion. He's a player." McDonald broke his left ankle 
in the third exhibition game of his rookie season in 1987, but it wasn't long 
after he returned to full strength that the Cardinals knew they had a "player." 
</P>
<P>
He showed flashes of brillance after coming off the injured-reserve list for 
the last three games. Still, McDonald went into the first game of last season 
with little experience. He was really just a rookie. He also was already a 
fixture at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, it became apparent that McDonald was blessed with both the 
talent and the mental approach to excel in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He had always been a marvelous all-around athlete. Football was his third sport 
at Fresno's Edison High, where he averaged 14 points a game as a guard and hit 
.465 as an outfielder his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
He had a pretty good senior season on the football field, too. A quarterback, 
safety and punter, he completed 57% of his passes for 2,739 yards and 30 
touchdowns, rushed for 400 yards and six touchdowns, intercepted five passes, 
made 123 tackles and averaged more than 41 yards a punt. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he made 325 tackles and intercepted 11 passes as a three-year starter at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe his success in his first full year with the Cardinals shouldn't have 
come as a surprise. He finished last season with a team-leading 115 tackles, 
two sacks, four forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and two interceptions. He 
added the special-team hat trick, blocking a punt, a field goal try and an 
extra point kick. 
</P>
<P>
Still, becoming a pro has not been easy for McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting used to the system was rough for me," he said. "Especially going to 
St. Louis (for the Cardinals' final season there before their move to Phoenix) 
after having never been out of California for any length of time in my life. 
Then I broke my ankle. I didn't know anybody. I was starting to wonder, 'Why 
me?' 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went pretty bad for me. You're around people who don't know what 
you can do. You're a rookie. You're hurt. And you don't get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The ankle healed, though and McDonald was able to provide a glimpse of things 
to come during the final three games of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I played pretty well," he said. "They had an idea going into camp that there 
was a good chance they had to find a place for me to play. That was my 
objective going into 1988. I came to camp early, determined to prove what I was 
capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
He certainly accomplished that. And he has spent the first 10 weeks of this 
season proving 1988 was no fluke. He leads the team with 75 tackles and the 
league in interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald has become close with Dennis Thurman, another former USC safety who is 
now the Cardinals' defensive back coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis and I talk about dreams all the time," McDonald said. "Before the New 
York (Giant) game, I told him I had a dream about interceptions and that I got 
a couple of them and took one back 80 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'When you're dreaming about them like that, they usually never 
happen. They usually come when you don't even think about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, sure enough, McDonald had two interceptions against the Giants. He 
intercepted the first one at the Cardinal 28-yard line -- he even looked down 
to see where he was -- but was caught 45 yards later. 
</P>
<P>
The second? 
</P>
<P>
"He had a missed assignment," Stallings said. "He was in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
Last week against Dallas, McDonald returned an interception 53 yards for a 
touchdown that put Phoenix ahead in the second quarter, 7-6. He intercepted 
another pass in the fourth quarter, returned it 42 yards and the Cardinals hung 
on for a 24-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I made one real good play and the other one the guy threw right at me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All these interceptions will probably get McDonald the recognition he believes 
he deserves. He thinks he is one of the best safeties in the league and should 
to go to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the season, I thought that if I played to my full potential, 
I'd have a pretty good shot at it," he said. "We're 5-5 now and I've been 
fortunate enough to stay healthy and make some plays. So I feel pretty good 
about my chances." 
</P>
<P>
A trip to the Pro Bowl couldn't hurt at contract negotiation time, but McDonald 
is one of those guys who tells you he'd play for free, and you believe him. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald sees an even greater reward for his recent big-play performances. The 
coaches are starting to slacken his reins a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that the coaches have allowed me to do a lot more things," he 
said. "They're allowing me to drop back and run to the ball and that's 
responsible for my high productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Memo to Cardinal coaching staff: 
</P>
<P>
Tim McDonald doesn't mind checking the secondary on every play to "make sure 
we're all on the right page at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
He promises to try his darndest to "secure my position first before I help 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
After that, though, it's probably best to just let him run amok.

SABERHAGEN GETS 3-YEAR EXTENSION WORTH $8.9 MILLION FROM ROYALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen has been given a three-year contract extension worth $8.9 
million by the Kansas City Royals, making him the highest-paid player in 
baseball, it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen could have become a free agent after next season had the Royals not 
given him the contract extension, which runs from 1991 through '93. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old right-hander will earn $2.75 million in both 1991 and '92 and 
$2.8 million in '93. He also got a $600,000 signing bonus, pushing the total to 
$8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' Orel Hershiser is in the middle of a three-year, $7.9-million 
contract. Hershiser made $2.4 million in 1989 and will get $1.6 million next 
season and $2.8 million in 1991. Hershiser got a $1.1-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' Eddie Murray, in the final two years of a five-year deal, will 
make $2.7 million in 1990 and $2.8 million in 1991. Murray's average salary 
during the length of his contract is $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, 23-6 last season after winning 20 of his last 22 games, had the 
option year of his contract, 1990, picked up shortly after the season ended. He 
will be paid $1.4 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who starred as a pitcher and shortstop at Cleveland High School in 
Reseda, was named the American League Cy Young Award winner Wednesday. He also 
won the award in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City recently signed 15-game winner Mark Gubicza to a three-year 
contract through 1992, meaning the Royals now have their top two pitchers 
locked up through the '92 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that Bret's career with the Royals will continue well into 
the future," General Manager John Schuerholz said. "He has established himself 
as one of the top pitchers in major league baseball and this contract reflects 
that."

BRAVES SIGN ESASKY FOR 3 YEARS

Nick Esasky on Friday signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Braves, a 
team that had wanted him for years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be a great addition to our ballclub and our rise to the top," 
said Bobby Cox, Atlanta vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a decision that was long coming," said Esasky, a first baseman who 
lives with his wife and three children in Marietta, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there was talk for many years of me coming here. It never seemed to 
work out. I'm totally excited about coming here and playing." 
</P>
<P>
Esasky became one of the top prizes among this year's free agents after batting 
.277 with 30 home runs and 108 runs batted in for the Boston Red Sox last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
His contract is believed to be worth $5.6 million plus incentives over the 
three years -- a $600,000 signing bonus and salaries of $1.15 million next 
season, $1.9 million in 1991 and $1.95 million in 1992. Each season he would 
get a bonus of $50,000 for playing 140 games or having 562 plate appearances, 
and another $50,000 for playing 150 games or 625 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"The Braves overwhelmed him with their offer," Boston General Manager Lou 
Gorman said.

ORANGE BOWL SELECTION OFFICIALS DENY THAT THEY BEAT THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are at least three weeks to go in this college football season, but the 
postseason bowls seem sewn up. Depending on which bowl director is asked, the 
reason is because the Orange Bowl lined up its guests early and forced everyone 
else to scramble for position. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the question is directed to Orange Bowl executive director Steven 
Hatchell, he will tell you something else. 
</P>
<P>
"The bowl pick 'em day is the third Saturday after the third Tuesday in 
November," said Hatchell. "That's a week later than usual. It falls after 
Thanksgiving and it will again next year, too. If you look at the schedules, 
most teams are through their conference schedules by then, and you can put your 
hand on the number of top independents. 
</P>
<P>
"By Thanksgiving, everyone wants to know where they're going." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Hatchell has known that No. 2 Colorado only has to beat Kansas State 
Saturday to assure the Buffaloes of a date in the Orange with Notre Dame. It is 
a fact that made Hatchell more than a little happy and his fax machine more 
than a little busy, with friends taking the time to harass him about his alma 
mater -- Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Part of a letter from Southern Mississippi basketball Coach M.K. Turk: 
</P>
<P>
"Let me see, your job is to pick one team for one day to play in one game and 
you spend 365 days doing it," wrote Turk. "Do you have another job like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Before and after Turk's letter has come a deluge of paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a roomful of derivations of what a buffalo is supposed to look like 
and a lot of them have Ghostbuster signs through them," said Hatchell. "The 
only problem is most of the drawings make the buffalo out to look like cows." 
</P>
<P>
Hatchell admits New Year's Day he will unabashedly root for the Buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Jimmy DeMoss is not your usual big college defensive back. 
Saturday, against Virginia, DeMoss will come to the end of his football career 
at Maryland. It is a career in which he has played in one game in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked on my sophomore year, I stuck it out and I got in a game two weeks 
ago against North Carolina," said DeMoss, a 5-foot-7, 173-pounder who played 
for Calvert Hall in Baltimore before going to Maryland. "It's been worth it. I 
love this game and I got in. A lot of guys don't." 
</P>
<P>
But even before DeMoss, an urban studies major, got in a football game, 
Maryland assistant coach Greg Williams said his services were particularly 
valuable this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all the injuries we've had," said Williams, "we couldn't have 
practiced if he and the other guys like him hadn't been here. Jimmy has been 
great for us. Most walk-ons want to know what you can do for them, but that kid 
never asked. He stuck with us through all the work, the cold, the rain and 
everything else. If there's any way possible, we'll get him in this last game." 
</P>
<P>
DeMoss in Williams' eyes is obviously DeMost. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Donahue, whose UCLA Bruins are a surprising 3-7, walked into a press 
luncheon the other day and solemnly began reading a statement: "I've done a lot 
of soul-searching, made evaluations and talked to my athletic director about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
What was this? Resignation? 
</P>
<P>
Donahue broke into a mischievous grin and said: "I, Terry Donahue, being of 
sound mind and body, declare myself insane to meet with sportswriters today." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's Lee Corso has finally proved he is from the World Beyond. Corso's 
justification for saying Houston's Andre Ware deserves the Heisman: 
</P>
<P>
"If a Martian came down and was asked to pick the best college football player 
in America, what would he do? He'd look at the stats. And the stats show Andre 
Ware is the best player in the country." 
</P>
<P>
So, who would trust a Heisman vote to a Martian, anyway?

WILLETTE PUTS SERRA IN WINNER'S CIRCLE

<P>
A little spitfire named Nikki Willette ended a drought of sorts Friday by 
winning the San Diego Section individual tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a Serra player, girl or boy, has ever appeared in a team 
or individual tennis final and the first time since the girls were included in 
playoffs (1974) that an Eastern League player has won the event. 
</P>
<P>
Before the match, Willette said, "Everyone was stopping me in the halls and 
saying, 'Good luck.' " 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Willette, a sophomore, made short work of top-seeded Brooke 
Galardi of Bishop's, needing only one hour 15 minutes for the 6-2, 6-4 victory 
at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the all-Torrey Pines doubles final, second-seeded Kim Sherrod and Kelly 
Kestler rallied from a one-set deficit to defeat No. 1 Krista Kuechler and Erin 
Bohrnstedt, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Willette was a bit surprised to even make the finals here. She had heard how 
tough an opponent second-seeded Sayaka Kimura of Poway was. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd make semifinals, but I didn't think finals," she said. "I was 
worried about Sayaka." 
</P>
<P>
Her fears were unfounded. Bishop's Branaca Elsberry upset Kimura in the 
quarterfinals, and Willette defeated Elsberry in straight sets Thursday to 
reach the final. Willette didn't lose a set and lost the fewest number of games 
(11), eight fewer than Galardi, in four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Willette used her quickness and toned down her natural aggressiveness somewhat 
to beat Galardi, who is in her practice group at Canyon Hills in Escondido. The 
last time they met, two years ago in a tournament in Ojai, Galardi won. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach told me to key in and hit deep, because she wouldn't make the 
errors," Willette said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Galardi: "I wasn't being patient. But she played well. It was a nice 
match." 
</P>
<P>
The doubles final was a replay of the Palomar League finals, when junior 
Kuechler and freshman Bohrnstedt, playing together for the first time, defeated 
Sherrod, a senior, and Kestler, a sophomore, in three sets. 
</P>
<P>
Without any pressure to repeat, Sherrod and Kestler were relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nothing to lose," Sherrod said. "The pressure was on them." 
</P>
<P>
Kestler said it was one of their best matches. "We set up our points more and 
were more aggressive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Torrey Pines coach Ann Meigs, it was the second time in less than six 
months that she had to sit quietly on the sidelines and coach. The boys' 
section doubles final in spring was also an all-Torrey Pines affair.

DRAWING THE LINE ON JIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Lewis' self-righteous article ("From a Self-Righteous Watchtower Comes a 
Verdict on Jimi Hendrix," Oct. 29) made me wonder what Randy thought was so 
dangerous about a "black-and-white attitude about drugs." It seems pretty black 
and white to me. Drugs don't have any place in our society. They kill people! 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, I don't believe the 100-plus students who wanted Hendrix's mural 
painted over had, as their motive, a desire to "eliminate from our eyes, ears, 
hearts and minds" anyone or anything. It seems they simply don't want their 
school glorifying, by means of a mural, a musician whose life was so dominated 
by drugs that they caused his death. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is unfortunate that (Ridgefield (Conn.) High School student 
Jonathan) Fulkerson doesn't represent the majority of students. It seems to me 
that "mature" and "courageous," rather than "self-righteous" and "pimple-faced" 
are the proper choice of adjectives for Jonathan Fulkerson and his friends.

KENYA INCREASES JOB TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

KAKAMEGA, Kenya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenya's educational system failed John Onyango Aloo. Although he is one of the 
few students able to complete high school in Kenya, he was unable to find a job 
after three years of searching. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 20s, Aloo studies auto mechanics at the Kakamega Youth Polytechnic. 
He thinks that his high school education did not give him the skills needed to 
get a good job and wishes that he had gone straight to a polytechnic after 
primary school. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have gained experience early," Aloo said. "In school, it is just 
theory most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Africa, there are millions of young people like Aloo. Many of them 
walk more than an hour in bare feet to reach school each day. They struggle to 
learn without books or laboratories, studying by the dim light of fires or 
kerosene lamps because their homes have no electricity. Their parents go into 
debt, sell precious cattle or buy less food so they can pay school fees. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of Africa's most prosperous and stable countries, but unemployment 
is estimated to be between 30% and 50%. Johnstone Makau, a member of 
Parliament, said recently that Kenya is sitting on a "time bomb." He added that 
each year the 800,000 students who finish school must compete for fewer than 
120,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Kenya's population of about 23 million people is under age 15. Last 
fall, President Daniel Arap Moi warned that Kenya's 4.1% annual population 
growth rate, the highest in the world, will increase its population to 35 
million in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
As the size of family farms shrinks, more young Kenyans are looking for paid 
employment. By the year 2000, Kenya's labor force is expected to double to 14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
To fight the increasing joblessness, the government in 1985 introduced a new 
8-4-4 curriculum -- eight years of primary education, four of secondary and 
four of university. The program lengthens the primary level by a year and adds 
agriculture, business, home science and crafts to the academic subjects 
inherited from the British colonial period. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in 1988 Moi created the Ministry for Technical Training and 
Technology to help hundreds of technical training institutes, youth 
polytechnics and technical training colleges. Tools, equipment and teachers are 
provided to these formerly independent vocational schools, now classified as 
public schools. The government hopes that enhanced training will encourage job 
seekers to stay in rural areas and either farm or find self-employment. 
</P>
<P>
The tremendous growth of Kenya's educational system forced the move toward 
vocational training. Since 1963, primary school enrollment has increased from 
891,000 to more than 5 million pupils. Secondary school enrollment rose from 
30,000 to 522,260 students in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students flooding the school system cannot go on to a university. 
This year only 4% or 5% of those who finish secondary school will be able to 
find places in Kenya's four universities. 
</P>
<P>
At Lwanda Secondary School in rural western Kenya, students are confident that 
the new curriculum will prepare them for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of them, Janet Naliaka, "jobs are very easy when you have gone 
through 8-4-4. If you learn and pass the exam, you will get a job without a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
But the system may not be able to help her. Typical of many poor schools, 
Lwanda is struggling to handle the new vocational subjects. With only two 
crumbling classrooms, a shortage of chalk, no laboratory and few books, it 
cannot afford carpentry, sewing or agricultural equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The government -- with 36% of its budget already allocated for education -- is 
unable to supply new tools to poor schools such as Lwanda. There is also a 
shortage of teachers trained to teach vocational subjects such as business and 
crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers worry that the 8-4-4 system will widen inequalities. Rich schools 
will buy more equipment, while poor schools such as Lwanda lag behind. 
</P>
<P>
Because the new practical subjects have been grafted onto the old curriculum, 
some students worry that their abilities are being stretched too thin. Along 
with vocational skills, secondary school students each year must study English, 
Swahili, mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, history, geography and 
religion. Each term they are tested in 12 subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Yet students still feel encouraged by the changes. They believe that if the 
government can find more resources to strengthen technical education, their 
future will be much brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"The 8-4-4 system is much better than the previous system," said Simon Lijina, 
a student at Lwanda. "It is now possible to employ anybody on any job." 
</P>
<P>
But even with 8-4-4, many graduates of regular schools are unable to attend a 
university, find a job or subsist on overcrowded family farms. 
</P>
<P>
Some fight for the about 20,000 places in technical and vocational schools and 
institutes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest and best-equipped, Kenya Polytechnic in Nairobi, trains 
4,500 students in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, graphic arts, 
institutional management, business studies, surveying and mapping. 
</P>
<P>
The government is increasing its support of these technical schools. For 
example, the Western College of Arts and Sciences, outside the town of 
Kakamega, received government assistance for the first time in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The college offers its 176 students courses in business, mechanical engineering 
and water technology. With the help of foreign aid, it has modern classrooms 
and workshops equipped with power saws, lathes, drills, rolling machines and 
kilns. Students spend 16 hours each week in the workshop and a term each year 
apprenticing with local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students expect their technical training to give them jobs. 
Geoffrey Soita, the youngest of eight children, taught briefly at a secondary 
school, but saw no opportunity for advancement. He came to college to learn 
accounting and hopes one day to manage his own accounting firm. "I am confident 
I can get a job if I succeed," he said. "The country's economic status is 
improving." 
</P>
<P>
Not all students, however, are sure they can find work. "If I pass, then I can 
have a hope," Samson Whaeme said. "I cannot be sure." 
</P>
<P>
Whaeme is the youngest of seven children. His father died the year he was born. 
His mother pays Western College's annual fees of 4,200 shillings ($230) from 
their small sugar cane crop. 
</P>
<P>
But the crop is only harvested every two years, and Whaeme does not know how he 
will pay to finish his mechanical engineering studies next year. He predicts 
that in 20 years, "the population will have doubled. For somebody without 
skills, there will be problems." 
</P>
<P>
Although Western's graduates are usually able to find jobs, securing employment 
may grow harder as Kenya becomes full of skilled craftsmen. "We are soon going 
to run into employment difficulties," said Vitalis Kweyu, an engineering 
teacher. He worries that graduates of the 8-4-4 system, polytechnics and 
training colleges "are all going to look for jobs" in the same places. 
</P>
<P>
Most vocational schools are not as well-equipped as Western or Kenya 
Polytechnic. For example, Kakamega Youth Polytechnic, which teaches tailoring 
and auto mechanics, has only two bare classrooms, one sewing machine, two 
abandoned cars, a few spare parts and two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy students are enrolled, but sometimes half of them are absent because 
they lack school fees. Although students apprentice with local firms during 
their 15- to 20-month training, 20% to 50% cannot find jobs after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
The poorer polytechnics, however, are beginning to receive government 
assistance. According to Raymond Muteshi, acting principal of Kakamega Youth 
Polytechnic, the government provides some tools, books and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
More help may be on the way. A 1988 government report recommended that the 
government absorb polytechnics into the regular school system, give them better 
equipment and offer their teachers more training. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this progress toward vocational education, large obstacles remain. 
Armed with technical skills, graduates may not be able to find jobs unless more 
industry is created. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya is counting on thousands of independent jua kali ("hot sun" in Swahili) 
artisans, who make shoes, tools, stoves, toys and utensils from rags and scrap 
metal, to create more employment. The government provides loans, marketing 
help, training and work space to these one-person industries. 
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering giving polytechnic graduates money and tools 
to start their own jua kali businesses. But these informal industries will not 
be able to absorb a majority of job seekers. 
</P>
<P>
The shift toward vocational education also seems to be leaving women behind. 
Sewing is often the only vocational skill they are taught. Only five women 
attend Kakamega Polytechnic, and less than 10% of Western College's students 
are female. Their teachers believe that they will have a tougher time finding 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
By changing its curriculum toward more vocational subjects, Kenya is improving 
the working skills of its students. The government recognizes that a problem 
exists and is trying to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
But the government has few funds left to expand vocational education or develop 
industry. Declining prices for Kenya's main exports of coffee and tea, rising 
prices for oil and other imports, and a $4.2-billion external debt are 
squeezing Kenya's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Without a rapid increase in jobs or a drastic decrease in the birthrate, many 
Kenyan students will be unable to find jobs even as their education improves. 
Kenya's minister for planning and national development, Zachary Onyonka, said 
recently that 2 million more jobs are needed for Kenya to combat its 
unemployment problems.

COMPUTER NETWORK SERVES AS GLOBAL CLASSROOM

<P>
Several times a week in his room at Oberlin College in Ohio, junior Matt 
Trawick talks to Michael Haass and Eva Steininger about the paradoxical 
behavior of objects moving near the speed of light. 
</P>
<P>
That's not unusual since all three students take the same course on Einstein's 
theory of relativity. What is unusual is that Haass attends the University of 
West Florida and Steininger is at the University of Vienna in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
They are part of a 13-week course -- the first of its kind -- linking 26 
students and five physics professors at seven colleges in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Trawick's desktop computer is tied to Oberlin's main computer, which in turn is 
tied to an international campus network called Bitnet, made up of 2,500 
computers at 800 schools and normally used only as a data bank. He gets physics 
assignments twice a week from course headquarters at the University of West 
Florida. Twice a week, he sends back completed problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Trawick is involved in a rich give-and-take with the members 
of his "class" all over the Western Hemisphere. He gets and sends about 10 
messages a day from fellow students and professors -- in what often becomes a 
protracted "bull session" in which students try to poke holes in Einstein's 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
Students explore and explain in writing why, for example, time slows down as 
speed increases, and why it's impossible for particles to reach the speed of 
light. They have to articulate new concepts every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith of the University of West Florida, the course organizer, hopes it 
will lead to more "multiversity" computer courses in which undergraduates 
exchange ideas and come into contact with top-ranking professors. Edwin Taylor 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who, with famed theorist John 
Archibald Wheeler, wrote the textbook that students use, participates in the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
But getting students to reflect, think through problems and especially write 
ideas is the key, said Smith. It's what separates the course from a typical 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Science students in general are rotten writers," he said. "They don't have 
familiarity with words, and they are too anxious to plug into equations without 
thinking about the reality of the ideas they are working with. We want them to 
get into the habit of thinking before they punch numbers into a calculator." 
</P>
<P>
Trawick says it's one of the best courses he has taken: "Einstein's ideas are 
very complex and sneaky and have all these lurking paradoxes. By writing them 
out rather than fiddling with them in your head, you come to understand them." 
</P>
<P>
Trawick has found himself solving problems simply by "stating the questions 
clearly enough." 
</P>
<P>
"John Wheeler says if you think through a problem long enough, you don't have 
to compute anything -- the answer becomes self-evident," Smith said. "Of 
course, he's a big gun. But that's the direction we are trying to move in." 
</P>
<P>
Other students such as Haass found that writing about physics makes it less 
intimidating. He came to find that the speed of light, for example, operates as 
a simple function in physics -- not some magical number. 
</P>
<P>
Physics, with its exploratory, problem-solving focus, is a course tailor-made 
for computer networking. Not all are, however, experts say. Lecture courses in 
history, English or math may not be as suited for free-floating study, they 
point out. 
</P>
<P>
Computer courses are not new. Other colleges have experimented with them -- the 
New School for Social Research and New York Institute of Technology, for 
example. The operating cost of such courses is high, however, because of phone 
bills that the Bitnet system, with its series of interlinking campuses, can 
avoid. Nor do they involve a wide range of colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The course doesn't save time, Taylor said. It doesn't save money or cut down 
the number of teachers needed. "But it forces kids to clarify their thinking 
and communicate ideas. You want to see that." 
</P>
<P>
Oberlin junior Anthony Anderson likes the fact that "you don't have to be in 
class at a scheduled time." He was excited by a recent discussion on 
"space-time intervals," in which he suggested that an imaginary number be used 
in an equation instead of a minus sign typically used in the Pythagorean 
Theorem: "It wasn't an original idea, exactly; Stephen Hawking has an equation 
where time is imaginary -- but it caused a lot of stir." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's the free-ranging discussions that students like most. 
</P>
<P>
The "relativity of simultaneity theory" sparked the best bull session so far. 
In this theory, events that appear to someone standing still to happen at the 
same time appear to an observer moving at high speed to happen at different 
times. 
</P>
<P>
One student conjured a scenario in which two rabbits beside a railroad track 
are struck by lightning. To a stationary observer, both rabbits seem to be hit 
at the same time, but to the person watching from a passing rail car, one 
rabbit is struck first. 
</P>
<P>
What would happen, the student asked, if a supersensitive carbon dating test 
were applied to both rabbits: Would this "objective" test show them to have 
been hit at the same time or not? 
</P>
<P>
"We finally figured that out, but I'm not sure I can explain it," Trawick said. 
</P>
<P>
Other participating schools include Boise State University in Idaho; Dickinson 
College in Carlisle, Pa.; New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, and Towson 
State University in Baltimore.

SOME PIXIE DUST, A HARNESS AND ACTORS SHOUT, 'I CAN FLY'

"Keep in mind smoothness, and watch your space," calls Joe McGeough to three 
floating children. He's teaching them to fly. 
</P>
<P>
All you need is a little fairy dust and some "lovely, wonderful thoughts," 
according to Peter Pan. Plus ropes, cables, wires, pulleys, harnesses and 
strong stagehands with firm grips, McGeough would add. He works for Flying by 
Foy. 
</P>
<P>
Any time you've seen a show with flying people, be it a musical, opera, ballet 
or rock concert, chances are that Flying by Foy had something to do with it. 
The company owns the patent on the flying harness. 
</P>
<P>
It was McGeough's father-in-law, Peter Foy, who started the company about 35 
years ago. In fact, he flew Mary Martin in "Peter Pan" on Broadway in 1954. 
Foy's son, Garry, flew Sandy Duncan in the musical's reprise in 1979. McGeough 
helped fly both Mary Martin (for a benefit in San Francisco a few years ago) 
and Sandy Duncan. Overall, the company has more than 3,000 productions of 
"Peter Pan" under its belt. 
</P>
<P>
Here, a community theater company, That New Theater, has been rehearsing hard 
for the musical version of the J. M. Barrie play. McGeough flew out (on a 
plane) from Las Vegas, to help the troupe achieve "that effortless look," which 
is what flying is all about, he says. Foy provides the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
At a dress rehearsal, surrounded by roughhousing Indians and Lost Boys, 
McGeough talked about his airborne adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to make flying look real. The emphasis is not on the equipment, 
but on the choreography -- the interplay of operators and actors. "There's more 
to flying than strapping someone in a harness," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone has a frightened look or doesn't look quite right, the audience 
feels uncomfortable," he says. Part of McGeough's job is putting the actors at 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is so calm and collected, so good at what he does -- I was never once 
afraid," says Donna Milani Luther, who plays Peter Pan. She says her harness, 
which resembles a parachutist's and is worn underneath costumes, is confining 
and often painful. "But I'm having the best time in years," she says. For 
children, lighter in weight, it's pure fun. 
</P>
<P>
"To be up in the air, it feels like, 'Wow! How can I be doing this? I must be 
dreaming,' " says Jason Reis, 11, who plays John Darling. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's dream, whether they're a child or an adult, is to fly," says 
McGeough, who has flown. "It's a real sensation of freedom," and for kids it's 
a magical moment when they fly, he says. 
</P>
<P>
McGeough has some hilarious Peter Pan bloopers to tell. There was the time 
during a rehearsal with Sandy Duncan when "we ended up flying Michael up 
Wendy's dress," he says. At another production, someone pulled the wrong rope 
in the last act: Jane (Wendy's daughter) is asleep, and Peter is supposed to 
fly through the window. Instead, sleeping Jane flew across the room -- blankets 
and all -- and Peter Pan was left hanging. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pan is only one faithful customer of Flying by Foy. The company travels 
worldwide and does some very complicated flying scenes, McGeough says. He 
refers to "Nina and the Twelve Months," a Russian play recently performed in 
Japan. The flying routines required motorized rigs with 12 people flying in a 
circle around one person suspended in the middle. A lot of engineering was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
When the Seattle Opera did Wagner's "Die Walkure," it had to fly women opera 
singers (each weighing about 220 pounds) riding model horses 20 to 30 feet in 
the air, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor productions have different problems. Take David Bowie's "Glass Spider" 
concert tour two years ago, for example. The company had to set up roof trusses 
and scaffolding, and take wind into account, says McGeough. In addition to 
Bowie, he has worked with David Letterman and Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby ("She 
flies very well"). 
</P>
<P>
Are people ever afraid? Maybe at first, but for the most part, performers grasp 
flying quickly and enjoy it. But "every once and a while, you get someone who 
flies like a sack of potatoes -- Liberace was like that; he was horrible!" he 
says, rolling his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Back in rehearsal, McGeough shouts instructions: "Windmill! Windmill!" he calls 
to flying Peter Pan. Then he scolds the people manning the ropes for not 
working together better. "I try to put myself in the air with the person," he 
offers. That way, there's a better chance the audience will come along for the 
ride, too.

FISHING BOAT HITS TANKER JUST OUTSIDE L.A. HARBOR; 
</P>
<P>
COLLISION: THE COAST GUARD IS INVESTIGATING THE ACCIDENT. ONE PASSENGER ON THE 
SPORTFISHING BOAT JUMPED OVERBOARD IN FRIGHT, BUT NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.

<P>
A sportfishing boat and a tanker hauling jet fuel collided in the darkness just 
outside Los Angeles Harbor shortly before midnight Thursday, tossing the small 
ship like a toy and injuring seven people, none seriously. One passenger jumped 
overboard in fright. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 passengers and seven crew members of the 80-foot fishing boat Shogun 
were hurled to the deck when the bow smashed into the Sealift Antarctic, a 
564-foot tanker on its way to San Francisco, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty barrels of jet fuel spilled into the sea. Some cleanup effort was made, 
but officials said the fuel evaporated rapidly and posed little threat to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators were investigating the collision, which occurred in 
calm, one-foot seas with six miles of visibility, Chief Petty Officer Mark 
Kennedy said. Both vessels were fully lighted and no others were nearby, 
Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
Drug tests were scheduled to be given to those at the helm and in command, 
investigators said, but results were not expected for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Terry Slechta was unreeling his line on the stern of the sportfishing 
boat and deckhand Vince Jenkins was 10 minutes from going to bed when they 
looked up and saw the huge tanker. It was as though a four-story building had 
risen up from the waters. 
</P>
<P>
"A big building, that's what it looked like. Just like that thing they brought 
King Kong home in," Slechta said later. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins bolted for the front of the boat, which was two miles outside the 
harbor's breakwater. The next thing he heard was "one big thud" as the Shogun 
plowed into the port side of the tanker six times its size. 
</P>
<P>
Sausages and lentil soup splattered over the galley. Passengers sleeping below 
were heaved from their bunks as the bow of the boat crunched into the tanker. 
Nearly 2,000 gallons of jet fuel spit from the tanker through a hole no bigger 
than a half-dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had been hit in the midship, we would have all been dead," Shogun 
passenger and part-time crew member Gary Hull said, still shaking. "We were 
such a little vessel at the mercy of such a big ship." 
</P>
<P>
When the sun rose Friday, the Shogun was sitting at Ports O'Call Village in San 
Pedro, its bow badly damaged. Its captain, 25-year-old Timothy Filson, was 
hospitalized with head injuries, but his condition was listed as good. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was anchored inside the breakwater with the hole in its midsection, 
a five-inch crack and a dented hull. None of its estimated 24 crew members was 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, a civilian ship chartered by the Navy and operated by Coast 
Guard-licensed merchant mariners, had loaded its cargo in the Port of Long 
Beach. It was heading toward San Francisco with 7.8 million gallons of jet 
fuel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said it was difficult to say whether the fishing boat would have 
shown up on the tanker's radar because of its size and low profile. "That's one 
thing the Coast Guard will be looking at -- should they have seen it, or could 
they have seen it," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials identified the tanker's skipper only as Capt. Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun, a 6-month-old charter sportfishing boat based in Ports O'Call, was 
bound for Catalina to catch squid for bait and then sail on to San Clemente for 
sea bass fishing. There were 35 passengers, four deck hands, two licensed 
skippers and one cook aboard, deckhand Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard was investigating whether radar aboard the vessel was operating 
at the time of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Shogun's passengers, including one woman and a boy celebrating his 
10th birthday, were asleep below when the vessels crossed paths about two miles 
south of Angel's Gate, a main entrance to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The few people who were on deck called out when they saw the ship, but it was 
too late, witnesses said. The boat began to pitch, and one frightened man 
leaped overboard, perilously close to the Shogun's propellers. Crewmen tossed 
plastic bottles, empty jugs, trash, anything they could find to mark his 
position in the darkness, Slechta said, then returned to pick him up when the 
vessels unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to keep yelling, 'Where are you?' It was so dark we couldn't see 
anything. He would yell back, 'I'm over here!' Finally we got to him and it 
took five of us to get him out of the water," Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Shogun passengers were taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital. Mark 
Capanni, 42; Ishihara Takaji, 43, and Andrew Lynch, 27, were released after 
treatment for cuts, bruises and a possible broken arm, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only the skipper was admitted. He declined to be interviewed Friday.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ROPING OFF DRUG AREAS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police barricades thrown up this week to reduce drug traffic in a Sepulveda 
neighborhood have worked dramatically there, but they did so by pushing the 
narcotics trade into nearby areas, Los Angeles police officials conceded 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, police have stepped up enforcement efforts in areas to the west 
and south of the 12-square block Columbus Avenue neighborhood they barricaded 
Nov. 7. In one area just four blocks west of the barricaded zone, for example, 
more than 40 drug buyers were arrested in a two-day undercover sweep this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like pushing an air bubble around inside an air mattress -- it changes 
location, but it doesn't go away," said Lt. Gary Rogness, who heads the Los 
Angeles Police Department's narcotics field enforcement unit in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean you don't try to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
The increase in drug traffic in nearby areas has raised questions about the 
effectiveness of cordoning off neighborhoods to fight drug activity, a tactic 
that Los Angeles police were said to be the first to use on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Councilman John Ferraro said the councilman wonders whether police 
will ultimately have to put "a Berlin Wall around Sepulveda" in order to stamp 
out drive-by drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to the barricades, but I think the question in the council 
will be, 'What have you accomplished if the dealers and buyers just move 
elsewhere?' " said Bill Gilson, Ferraro's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Mark D. Stevens said police expected that closing Columbus Avenue would 
cause narcotics traffic to spill over into nearby areas, which already were 
active drug spots. Now, officers want to temporarily barricade the neighborhood 
to the west, but Stevens said it may be difficult because it contains two 
schools and a church. 
</P>
<P>
"We've ferreted the dealers out of their holes and we're going to keep after 
them," said Stevens, adding that he believes drug dealers will not move into 
single-family neighborhoods to the north and east because they would be too 
visible there. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said he has increased patrols in surrounding Sepulveda areas, using a 
10-officer task force that previously concentrated efforts in the Columbus 
Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rogness sent his special narcotics enforcement unit into Sepulveda 
neighborhoods surrounding the barricaded area for two days last week. 
</P>
<P>
Police are urging the City Council to make permanent the barricades around the 
Columbus Avenue neighborhood. Under the proposal, apartment owners in the area 
would donate money to set up and staff a guard station at the corner of 
Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street. City public works officials had no 
estimate Friday of how much the proposal would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 15 council members said this week that they support the idea -- and 
two said they were considering it -- but some have reservations about the 
impact on nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is being lauded by apartment owners who say they are tired of 
grappling with the problem. "I'm for anything that helps keep (the area) clear 
of drug traffic," said Guenter Pauly, owner of a six-unit building he fenced 
last year to keep drug dealers from using his parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Joel Wachs, Ernani Bernardi, Hal Bernson, Mike Woo, Gloria Molina 
and Zev Yaroslavsky said they support the proposal. Yaroslavsky said that 
"nothing is more important than the peace of mind" of the Columbus Avenue 
residents, whose neighborhood has long been the most active drug-trafficking 
spot in the Valley, according to Rogness. 
</P>
<P>
But the barricades have not contributed to the peace of mind of Teresa Guzman, 
a baby-sitter who lives west of the cordoned-off area. 
</P>
<P>
She said friends living on Columbus Avenue tell her that the dealers have 
vanished. "They have all come over here," Guzman said. "I wish they'd close the 
streets here too."

POLICE BARRICADES GIVE PEACE A CHANCE IN DRUG-TORN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Inside Los Angeles' newest gated community -- a 12-square-block area cordoned 
off by police earlier this month -- the shouts of children playing have 
replaced the bursts of gunfire that commonly shattered the peace when drug 
dealers ruled the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much easier to sleep now that they closed off the neighborhood to the 
drug addicts and sellers," said Rosalena Jimenez, a 39-year-old housewife who 
said that in the past her family was frequently disturbed by the sound of 
screeching cars, raucous street brawls and gunfire. Now that the tide of 
drive-by drug traffic has been halted, "I don't have to watch my boys like a 
hawk anymore when they play outside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police put up sawhorse barricades last week at four of the five entrances to 
the Sepulveda neighborhood to deter drug buyers. The roadblocks, similar to 
those in the Pico-Union area west of downtown, have been so successful that 
police want to permanently barricade the streets and erect a guard station at 
the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street to admit only residents and 
their guests. 
</P>
<P>
Closing the streets permanently would require approval from the City Council 
and the cooperation of the more than two dozen property owners in the area who 
would have to donate money to set up and staff the guard station. 
</P>
<P>
A diverse group of mostly low-income tenants, many of whom are elderly, 
Hispanic or recent immigrants, live in the neighborhood. Fed up with the steady 
stream of drug buyers, they appear to strongly support the proposal, although a 
minority say they are embarrassed to be living in an area police have deemed a 
"narcotics enforcement zone." 
</P>
<P>
"I personally want to move out because it looks real bad to live here," said 
Cheryl Insalaco, 25, a clothing store manager who lives with her mother. "The 
people I work with found out I'm from there and they said, 'Geez, it must be a 
pretty bad area.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Cayetano Guerrerro, 67, an ice cream vendor who also lives in the area, 
said the transformation of the neighborhood into a peaceful enclave is worth 
any stigma. 
</P>
<P>
"Just take a look and you can see -- it's much better now without those cholos 
hanging around pretending to buy my ices whenever the police go by," he said. 
"I don't always have to watch out for thieves." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrerro's route takes him past a jumble of new and old apartment complexes in 
the area, most of which are already gated to keep drug dealers from using 
parking lots to hawk their wares. The neighborhood also contains an 84-unit 
complex for senior citizens and Penny Lane, a nonprofit home for more than 100 
emotionally disturbed children age 6 to 18, some of whom have been convicted of 
drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
One 16-year-old Penny Lane resident lounging this week with friends outside the 
one-story stucco facility said she used to sell drugs on nearby Columbus 
Avenue, also known as "C Street" because of the heavy traffic in rock cocaine 
there. Since the barricades were erected, she said, she finds going outside 
"less of a temptation because there aren't any drugs nearby. Maybe the dealers 
go somewhere else, but I don't care as long as they're not in front of my 
place." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the home said the blockade is "great. We've needed something 
like this for years because every time the police would leave, the dealers 
would come back." He asked that his name not be used because drug dealers have 
threatened him in the past after he asked them to move away from the home. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Rayen Park, a gated apartment complex for senior citizens, also 
applauded the closure of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbus Avenue is a nasty street," said Lesley Blackstone, 87, a retired 
jeweler who uses a cane. "We're always afraid the dealers will go after us. I'm 
glad the police are finally doing something to protect us." 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, a 10-officer task force working undercover and in 
uniform patrolled several high-crime Sepulveda neighborhoods, including the 
Columbus Street area, said Capt. Mark Stevens of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
To further increase police presence in the neighborhood, six to eight officers 
were assigned to Sepulveda on foot patrol during a brief pilot program in 
September to test the effectiveness of the technique. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens said police officials realized that more than foot patrols were 
needed when a drive-by shooting wounded two visitors to the community late last 
month on Columbus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired in part by the success of the Rampart Division in temporarily 
barricading a Pico-Union neighborhood, Stevens said, he set up the roadblocks 
Nov. 7 in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
At least one person is not happy with the change the barricades have wrought. 
Oscar Barnett, who drives a catering truck in the area, said the street 
closures have cost him money because there are fewer people in the neighborhood 
now that drug customers are shunning it. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Sock it to the cops,' " Barnett said. "The Constitution allows the 
highways and byways of this nation to be open to anybody."

PANEL FIRES LIGHT RAIL CONSULTANT FACING TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION CANCELS THE CONTRACT OF A FORMER 
SHERIFF'S SERGEANT ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A security consultant on the $750-million Los Angeles to Long Beach light rail 
project was fired Friday after the county Transportation Commission learned 
that he faces trial for allegedly embezzling $9,500 while a sergeant for the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The commission approved a $75,000, six-month contract with John R. Stacy on 
Thursday to coordinate anti-crime efforts on the construction project. But 
Commission Executive Director Neil Peterson canceled the contract late Friday 
after The Times made inquiries about Stacy's background. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, 47, was fired by the Sheriff's Department last year after he allegedly 
forged his supervisor's name to obtain $9,500 in unwarranted overtime during a 
13-month period ending in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled for trial Dec. 5 in Los Angeles Superior Court on embezzlement 
and forgery charges. An earlier trial ended in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
After learning about Stacy's legal problems, Peterson met with board members 
and commission staffers. Then he announced that he was canceling Stacy's 
contract and ordering stiffer background checks on all private contractors who 
do business with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also said that he had reprimanded the two executives responsible for 
hiring Stacy about five months ago as an interim security administrator for the 
22-mile light rail line to be completed next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"An error in judgment was made," Peterson said. "But once you get stung like 
this, you learn a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said Stacy's new contract, to go into effect next month, was revoked 
and his old one was canceled Friday because he did not "disclose fully" the 
status of his embezzlement case. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with issues of basic integrity and representation of facts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the commission had not been informed that the county Civil 
Service Commission had refused this year to reinstate Stacy, who left the 
Sheriff's Department in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy's attorney, Bradley Brunon, could not immediately be reached for comment 
on the contract cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Brunon said that Stacy had a right to work as a security 
consultant even though he had been terminated from the Sheriff's Department 
after 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been convicted of any offenses," the attorney said. "And, in fact, 
11 of 12 (jurors in the first trial) didn't believe he committed these 
offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Brunon said that Stacy was entitled to the $9,500 in overtime but failed to 
follow proper administrative procedures. It was common practice for sheriff's 
officers at the Los Angeles County-USC jail ward to sign their own time cards 
because their superior worked in another building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Light rail security director Louis Hubaud, who hired Stacy, said he did not 
tell the commissioners about Stacy's background partly because he thought 
charges against him were dismissed last May when a Superior Court jury could 
not decide on his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"The more important thing was his technical ability and . . . (there was) a 
hung jury," said Hubaud, who worked with Stacy in the 1970s when both were 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hubaud said he checked with Stacy's former employer, the Sheriff's 
Department, and was told "there was no problem" with hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
Hubaud said he was surprised last month when other sheriff's officials told him 
their investigation of Stacy was continuing and they refused to work with him 
on security matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, under a $1.1-million contract, is the law enforcement 
agency primarily responsible for providing security while the rail line is 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stacy was the liaison with the sheriff's office and other local police 
agencies, Hubaud said he concluded that Stacy could still work effectively and 
recommended the new $75,000 contract. The six-month contract would have paid 
$49,600 in base salary, and up to $25,000 more in overtime and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Hubaud and Peterson characterized Stacy as an excellent employee who helped 
reduce vandalism and theft by alerting local police agencies to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The other part of this story is that Mr. Stacy did a very good job over the 
months," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission had lost about $350,000 to vandalism and theft before Stacy's 
arrival, and has lost only about $24,000 since then, Hubaud said. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members expressed surprise that they were not informed of Stacy's 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that if the commissioners had known all this, they might not have 
approved the contract," Chairwoman Christine Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Ray Grabinski said, "I'm obviously concerned that we weren't 
briefed" about Stacy. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that in the future consultants will be subjected to the same 
background checks and battery of questions as permanent employees.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOVIET FAMILY TO DANCE WITH LONG BEACH 
BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glasnost came to Long Beach Friday, when city officials welcomed a family of 
Russian ballet dancers who are among the first Soviet citizens to be allowed to 
come to this country specifically to dance with an American ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Artyushkin and his wife, Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina, both principal 
dancers in the Bolshoi Ballet, will play leading roles in the Long Beach Ballet 
Company's production of the "Nutcracker." Their 6-year-old daughter, Katya, 
also will appear. Although Russian dancers have been allowed to dance with 
American companies before, ballet officials say these are the first to perform 
here as a family. 
</P>
<P>
The family expressed happiness at being in California. "It is wonderful when 
you can make a discovery each day," Khaniashvili-Artyushkina said through an 
interpreter.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTON TO RETIRE FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Anton, deputy superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
and its highest-ranking Latino, has told district officials that he will retire 
at the end of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Once a finalist for the superintendent's job that was won by Leonard Britton, 
Anton, a 37-year district veteran, is the first of the upper-echelon old guard 
to leave since Supt. Harry Handler retired almost 2 1/2 years ago. Anton 
disclosed his plans to retire from his $146,052-a-year post in a letter to 
Britton earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Anton, 65, grew up in Los Angeles and began his career in 1952 as a teacher at 
Rowan Avenue Elementary School.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TASK FORCE ON ALTERNATE FREEWAY ROUTES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Pasadena officials have asked the state Department of Transportation to 
establish an independent task force to consider alternatives to building the 
last link of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, with the support of the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation, made the request in a letter sent this week to Robert Best, 
director of the department. A Caltrans spokesman said Friday that the letter 
had not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The council criticized Caltrans for not extensively considering options such as 
light rail and partial completion of the freeway gap that exists between the 
San Bernardino and Foothill freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's proposal, the study of the freeway expansion -- which would 
cut through Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra and Los Angeles' El Sereno 
neighborhood -- would be conducted by experts from outside the state.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPLAINT CITES SCHOOLS FOR REFUSING 
TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Watts mother of 10 has filed a federal civil rights complaint against the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for refusing to allow her son to attend a 
junior high school outside the gang-plagued neighborhood where they live. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed with the Department of Justice, alleges that the district 
violated Linda Lofton's right to "educate her child in a safe environment 
conducive to learning" when it would not bus her son away from his neighborhood 
to Nobel Junior High School in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton, 35, said she has kept her 12-year-old son, Ramon Atchison, at home 
since the beginning of the school year rather than send him to Charles Drew 
Junior High, the local school. But school officials said Friday that Lofton 
must enroll her child in Drew before they can consider permitting him to 
transfer.

INDIAN HISTORIAN FINDS PARALLELS TO JUDAIC TRADITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SPIRITUALITY: CREEK RESEARCHER SAYS THE SIMILARITIES TO EARLY HEBREW AND 
CHRISTIAN TEACHINGS ARE ASTONISHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an aged Indian woman, Bessie Snake, lost her husband when he and his two 
mules were killed by lightning while plowing, his younger brother dutifully 
married the widow. 
</P>
<P>
That obligation is part of the religious traditions of the Delaware and some 
other tribes, matching a responsibility laid down in the biblical laws of 
ancient Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"The similarities of early native American religions and ancient Hebrew 
religion are astonishing," says historian Duane Hale of the Creek tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, a researcher of the American Indian Institute at the University of 
Oklahoma, also notes congruent strains with early Christianity. Similarities 
include Indian expectations of a Christ-like benefactor, emphasis on communal 
sharing of everything, and emphasis on modesty by not calling attention to 
oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"All American Indians were -- and most are today -- deeply religious and 
devoted to their belief in one supreme being," Hale said in an interview. He 
discounted past characterizations of some old tribal rites as pagan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's pagan to go up on a mountain and pray to try to get a 
vision," he said, describing the "vision quest" of the Sioux and some other 
tribes. "It's similar to what the biblical prophets did." 
</P>
<P>
Hale, 47, former co-chairman of the Department of Navajo and Indian Studies at 
Navajo Community College in Arizona and now with the university's institute 
here, researches and writes tribal histories. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, he has completed them for six tribes. He also conducts training 
workshops to help Indians across the country learn how to preserve tribal lore. 
Participants have come from about 200 of the nation's 300 recognized tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven of them have tribal headquarters in Oklahoma, which remained 
mostly Indian territory until 1907. The university's Western History 
Collections library is considered the best on the plains tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Because Indians generally have depended on handing down their religious 
traditions orally, "there's a great danger they will be lost," Hale said. "In 
many cases, they have been. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not enough Indian histories. Many of the elders are dying, and I try 
to teach them to write their histories. Some are beginning to record it and put 
it in locked files only for the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
Although Indian religion sometimes is portrayed as highly distinct from 
biblical faith, Hale sees definite resemblances, judging on the basis of his 
advanced biblical studies as well as firsthand inquiries into Indian religion. 
</P>
<P>
"Christianity and early Indian religion have been so interwoven that it is 
often difficult now to tell which came first for them," Hale said. Of 1.4 
million U.S. Indians, most are Christians but many also retain tribal insights, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Native American Church, which combines both Christianity and native 
religion, stemmed from the "ghost dance" religion started in the 1890s by a 
Paiute Indian from Nevada, preaching return of the buffalo and Christ to lift 
up the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
"It spread like wildfire," Hale said, adding that it uses the hallucinogenic 
peyote bean "as a sacrament," which also is used in a "limited way" in some 
other tribal religions. 
</P>
<P>
He said these also make extensive use of chants, the drum, the four directions, 
the circle, the smoked pipe and smoke from burning cedar waved about by a 
feather to ward off evil. 
</P>
<P>
However, religious details vary from tribe to tribe, and often remain obscure, 
since there were no reliably balanced accounts of Indian concepts for the first 
100 years of contacts with Europeans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On how he determines what religious elements are originally Indian, he said: "I 
only accept what the elders tell me is true. Some of it possibly came from back 
there in the seed of missionaries to some degree. At this point, nobody knows 
absolutely."

MANY IN UNITED CHURCH SIDESTEP TALK ABOUT FAITH

<P>
Talking about faith has never been considered the province of mainline 
Christians, who more often than not willingly concede that territory to their 
counterparts in the evangelical and fundamentalist ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Now the United Church of Christ, one of the pillars in the liberal mainline 
church Establishment, offers some statistical evidence of just how 
uncomfortable members of that 1.6-million-member denomination are when it comes 
to talking about their faith. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey of more than 2,000 members in more than 200 United Church of 
Christ congregations around the country, 19% of the respondents said they do 
not need to learn how to talk about faith because their actions speak for them. 
And 10% said they do not want to learn ways to talk about their faith because 
it would make them look like fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
As telling, perhaps, as the statistics are some of the comments that survey 
participants made about talking about their faith. 
</P>
<P>
One member from Hawaii said, "Why do we have to talk to others if we're doing 
good? Talking is just words." 
</P>
<P>
A member from Michigan said, "If you live your faith, you don't have to talk 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
And from California came the comment, "The last time I talked to someone about 
my faith she never talked to me again." 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging a reluctance to talk about their faith, some survey 
participants expressed a desire to overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
A church member in Indiana, for example, said, "I would talk about my faith if 
the church could find a way to get me over my shyness. It's not part of my 
tradition to overtly talk about my faith." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what would help them talk about their faith, 47% pointed to more 
knowledge of the Bible; 32% said discussion groups would help, and 25% pointed 
to opportunities to practice. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelism -- or talking about faith to the unchurched -- has become a matter 
of growing concern among mainline denominations in recent years as membership 
in those churches continues the downward plunge that began in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelism and membership growth was adopted as one of three new four-year

GE WILL SPEND UP TO $10 BILLION TO REPURCHASE ITS OWN STOCK 
</P>

<P>
General Electric Co., cash-rich and seeking to win further favor with 
shareholders, said Friday that it plans to spend as much as $10 billion over 
the next five years to repurchase its own stock. 
</P>
<P>
The huge buyback is evidence that GE believes it is generating more than enough 
cash to sustain growth and is a signal that, after years on the prowl, it is no 
longer actively searching for a multibillion-dollar acquisition. The 
manufacturing and financial services conglomerate also increased its dividend 
15%, to 47 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a blockbuster acquisition ahead," John F. Welch Jr., GE's 
chairman, told securities analysts at a meeting Friday afternoon. "We've 
reached the conclusion that GE stock is the best investment we can make." 
</P>
<P>
A $10-billion stock buy would reduce the cumulative value of GE's outstanding 
shares by 18% and would probably increase the value of each share. In dollar 
value, the buyback is the largest ever announced by a company, although the 
five-year term of the repurchase is longer than most. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Howe, an analyst with the Butcher &amp; Singer brokerage in 
Philadelphia, also noted that a number of other companies have repurchased 
larger portions of their stock market value; last year, General Signal bought 
back stock worth more than 30% of the total, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyback announcement had a predictable reaction on Wall Street, which bid 
up GE stock $2 a share to a close of $59.50. Volume was 3.11 million shares. 
The news generally gave a push to the stock market, where the Dow Jones 
industrial index closed up 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
However, GE attached several caveats to the buyback plan. Company officials 
said "unfavorable economic conditions" or an unexpected acquisition might 
change their plans. 
</P>
<P>
But Welch stressed that the economy looks "solid." And only a very tempting 
acquisition target -- such as RCA Corp., which GE bought in 1986 -- could 
persuade the company to change its current thinking on takeovers, he added. 
"We're not looking for new businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since he took over GE in 1982, Welch has reshaped the world's 10th-largest 
industrial corporation, trimming it from 100 sometimes-marginal operations to 
14 businesses with strong positions in their markets. The businesses include 
aircraft engines, financial services, medical imaging equipment, appliances, 
lighting and broadcast television. 
</P>
<P>
Welch has sold $19 billion worth of assets in this decade and purchased $16 
billion worth, notably including RCA, with its NBC Television unit, and the 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm. Earnings per share have been rising 
at an annual rate of 7.6% a share, contrasted with 4.9% a year under Welch's 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Even after GE reinvests about $6 billion a year in the company, its far-flung 
operations generate another $2 billion in cash each year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the buyback would make GE look good to investors in several 
ways. It should continue to help the stock price and will improve the 
return-on-equity and return-on-investment ratios that Wall Street follows 
closely, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every chief executive considers the stock price a sort of report card, and 
this should help Jack Welch's," said Linda M. Shuman, analyst with Prudential 
Bache Securities. She predicted that the buyback might boost GE's per-share 
growth by as much as 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
GE insisted that the buyback does not mean that it is dissatisfied with its 
current stock price. But some analysts disagreed, contending that GE officials 
have wished that Wall Street had a fuller appreciation of the company's 
financial progress. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's closing price, the stock was trading at slightly under 14 times 
expected 1989 earnings. By comparison, the average stock in the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 stock index is now trading at about 13 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman also said the buyback would quiet the worries of investors who have 
feared that GE might make a large acquisition that would dilute the value of 
their shares. 
</P>
<P>
Because of GE's aggressive acquisition program during this decade, the company 
is constantly the subject of Wall Street takeover rumors. Welch noted, with 
amusement and exasperation, that GE officials continued to receive phone calls 
even after Friday's announcement inquiring whether GE planned to purchase MCA 
Inc., the big entertainment company based in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said GE's decision to turn its attention from major acquisitions may 
reflect in part the run-up prices for many companies. It may also reflect the 
fact that GE will be busy attending to the acquisitions and joint ventures it 
has recently made. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the company announced that it will spend $150 million to 
purchase a Hungarian light-bulb company. Earlier this year, it announced 
European joint ventures in the mobile communications, appliance and gas-turbine 
businesses. Last year, GE paid $2.3 billion to acquire Borg-Warner Chemical 
Co., based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
GE said Friday that it will purchase the shares in the open market. It said 
credit-rating agencies have assured the company that the buyback will not hurt 
GE's current triple-A debt rating.

BIG PLANS BRING BIGGER HEADACHES TO USAIR; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE FIRM WAS STILL HANDLING PROBLEMS FROM PURCHASES OF PIEDMONT AND 
PSA WHEN THE INDUSTRY WENT INTO A SLUMP. THEN MOTHER NATURE STRUCK.

<P>
These are not good times for USAir Group, parent of USAir. 
</P>
<P>
Its merger with Piedmont Airlines, the largest in airline history, was planned 
with patience and precision. But it did not come off as smoothly as had been 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington-based USAir has also been buffeted by natural disasters -- Hurricane 
Hugo and the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake -- and by troubles being 
suffered generally throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the big problems grew out of the merger. USAir management had paid close 
attention to the mergers of other airlines, hoping to learn from their 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
That is the way that USAir conducts all of its business, many industry 
observers say. "Neither flamboyant nor overly aggressive," is the way Louis 
Marckesano, airline analyst with the Philadelphia-based brokerage of Janney 
Montgomery Scott, describes USAir. 
</P>
<P>
"Management has concentrated on developing and on dominating its historical 
markets in a methodical, low-risk fashion (and) exhibited the same cautious, 
go-slow approach" in its mergers with both Piedmont and Pacific Southwest 
Airlines, Marckesano added. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.6-billion purchase of Piedmont took place in April, 1987, but the two 
airlines' operations were not fully integrated for 16 months. In 1986, USAir 
had swallowed up PSA for $313 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all USAir's efforts, there still were significant merger-related 
expenses and problems, not just with the Piedmont takeover but also with the 
PSA marriage, which made USAir the airline industry's largest West Coast 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
Integrating the operations of the merged airlines cost much more than had been 
estimated. Everything from computers to pilot training and maintenance 
procedures needed to be meshed. It cost $30 million just to install first-class 
service in the planes of the joined airlines. Piedmont was just developing 
first-class service at the time of the merger and neither USAir nor PSA offered 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Also, work forces had to be put together, and that job was complicated when 
some employees refused transfers -- taking early retirement or quitting -- 
which resulted in understaffing at some locations. As a result, workers in the 
field had to take heat from irate customers. 
</P>
<P>
Though new people were hired and trained, morale and performance slipped for a 
time. Flights were delayed or scratched. Baggage was lost. Spare parts for 
airliners ended up in the wrong cities. Veteran employees feared that their 
jobs were in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Costs soared. Edwin I. Colodny, USAir Group's chairman, said in a recent 
interview that it is costing USAir $58 million a year to raise the wages of 
former PSA and Piedmont employees to USAir's pay scales. And merger-related 
pilot training and conversion of computer systems will cost the company $40 
million this year, about the same as the $37 million it cost last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of this fiscal year, USAir suffered its first loss in 
seven quarters and its first loss in a third quarter in more than 15 years. The 
carrier reported an operating loss of $71.9 million in the quarter, contrasted 
with an operating income of $136.7 million in the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Colodny is candid about the troubles the airline experienced after the final 
integration with Piedmont on Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't run smoothly for a while," he said in the interview, "despite all 
the planning. . . . We had a very rough period for about 2 1/2 weeks . . . 
particularly on the former Piedmont system. On-time performance was very poor. 
We had cancellations. We knew we were going to take a hit on the merger." 
</P>
<P>
But the kinks were slowly worked out, and things began to improve. The new 
USAir was getting its act together. 
</P>
<P>
But then, on Sept. 22, came Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing quite well until the hurricane," Colodny recalled. "That 
hurricane busted us up pretty badly. . . . Charlotte, N.C., (where USAir has 
its major hub) was just wiped out for 24 hours. . . . (We lost) 300 flights a 
day, plus all of the computer system was out." 
</P>
<P>
The storm probably cost the company as much as $25 million in lost revenue and 
extra expenses, estimated Helane Becker, airline analyst with the New York 
investment firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton. Robert McAdoo, airline analyst with 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., another New York financial firm, added that 
"conservatively" the airline lost 25% of its revenue for three full days. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had USAir mopped up after Hugo than the Oct. 17 earthquake hit San 
Francisco, where USAir operates 82 daily flights. "We . . . stopped a lot of 
flights from going into San Francisco until we knew what the situation was," 
Colodny said. "We had crews that were unable to get to airplanes and planes 
that were out of position, and we had five days of disruption on the system as 
a result." 
</P>
<P>
These troubles, plus a few others common to the industry, have made it a dismal 
year for USAir, which has one of the best profit records in the industry and 
which has not had an annual loss for more than a dozen years. Promotional fare 
programs, especially on the West Coast, and a higher-than-expected redemption 
of frequent flyer awards have hurt USAir, as has the rebuilding of a flight 
schedule by a major competitor -- Eastern Airlines, which is trying to emerge 
from bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The end of USAir's troubles is not in sight. Throughout the industry, traffic 
is weak and costs are higher than expected. USAir's fuel bill alone has jumped 
12.8% in the third quarter to 56.4 cents a gallon, costing the carrier an extra 
$20.6 million in the quarter, according to Edward J. Starkman, airline analyst 
with the Paine Webber brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"If the summer was a loss, expect a tough winter," said Oppenheimer's McAdoo. 
"Given the seasonality of USAir's routes, including its substantial business in 
the Northeastern U.S., where winter weather causes damage each year, the 
company should incur substantial losses in the next few quarters. . . . 
Realistically, USAir may not have a profitable quarter (until) one full year 
from now." 
</P>
<P>
Colodny disagrees, saying he expects "a profitable year" but acknowledging that 
profits will be "down significantly from last year." For all of 1988, USAir 
reported net profits of $165 million, off 15% from the year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
USAir has great hopes for the California market, but Colodny said it is a tough 
nut to crack. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very competitive right now," he said. "Some of the local markets 
have had too much capacity. . . . You've got USAir, you've got American, you've 
got United and Alaska -- and now Southwest has entered the market with very 
aggressive pricing. Southwest charges much higher fares in Texas (its home) 
than they do in California." 
</P>
<P>
He says he does not know his competitors' figures and will not disclose USAir's 
load factors in California. But, he maintained, "We're holding our own. . . . 
As to whether anybody is making money in the short-haul California markets at 
the moment, my guess is: probably not. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the marketplace decide who is going to survive and who decides to pull 
out," he added. "For the long run, California is going to become a very strong 
market. So we have no intention of disappearing in California." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USAir has been carrying "superb" loads on long-haul routes between 
Eastern cities and the West Coast, Colodny said. Since March, 1987, he added, 
USAir's number of daily flights into Los Angeles has been doubled to 20. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, through the mergers and airliner purchases, has built a fleet of 
432 planes, the industry's second largest next to United's. It has another 107 
planes on order and options on still another 149. 
</P>
<P>
Colodny, who had traditionally opposed airline mergers, said he was pushed into 
both of USAir's consolidations to meet the competition. He still complains that 
such marriages "are an expensive way to grow in the short run" but concedes 
that "in the long run we will have a much stronger airline." From now on, he 
said, he wants USAir to grow from within, and he insisted that he has no desire 
for the company to acquire or be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
USAir has had a tough time fighting off a bad reputation from its early days, 
when its name was Allegheny (some called it Agony) Airlines. It was the Rodney 
Dangerfield of the airline industry, getting little respect and becoming the 
butt of frequent jokes. 
</P>
<P>
One of Allegheny's ancestors was Mohawk Airlines, about which this probably 
apocryphal story was told: 
</P>
<P>
A control tower gets a request from a pilot of an incoming plane asking for the 
time of day. "That depends on which airline is asking," said the controller. 
"If this is American, it is 1300 hours. If it's United, it's 1 p.m. And if this 
is Mohawk, Mickey's big hand is on the 12 and his little hand is on the one." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Allegheny changed its name to USAir. But its reputation for lateness 
did not change immediately, and customers often said the new name was actually 
an acronym for Unfortunately Still Allegheny in Reality. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Colodny, who started his career with the company in 1957 as 
assistant to the president, became head of what was then Allegheny in 1975. He 
said he believes that USAir is now a respected member of the industry and that 
its bad old days are behind it. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, it still has a few hurdles to get over.

Amdahl Corp. Lays Off 400: The Sunnyvale maker of mainframe computer systems 
blamed steep price discounting by International Business Machines, its primary 
competitor, and the strong U.S. dollar for the cuts, which were effective 
Friday and will hit about 5% of its work force. About 80% of the layoffs will

latest of several computer makers to resort to layoffs as conditions in the

Hewlett-Packard Co.: The Palo Alto computer company said net income in fiscal 
1989 rose 2% to $829 million. Revenue totaled $11.9 billion, up 21% from fiscal 
1988. The company cited several non-recurring expenses that affected earnings: 
the acquisition of Apollo Computer; a $6-million charge to offset the 
fourth-quarter effects of the Apollo acquisition on employee payouts under the 
company's cash profit-sharing plan, and a $9-million charge to cover costs 
related to the Oct. 17 Bay Area Quake.

AXA MIDI ACCUSES BAT OF USING 'POISON PILL' TACTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French insurer Axa Midi Assurances accused BAT Industries on Friday of using 
its Farmers Group subsidiary as a "poison pill" in a takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi would own Los Angeles-based Farmers Group if Sir James Goldsmith is 
successful in his effort to purchase BAT Industries in what would be history's 
second-largest takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"BAT is trying to manipulate the U.S. insurance regulators into playing a 
spoiler role in an international takeover battle," Claude Bebear, chairman of 
Paris-based Axa Midi Assurances, charged in a statement released in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Goldsmith finds his Hoylake Investments in a Catch-22 trap: U.S. 
insurance regulators refuse to approve the sale of Farmers without details of 
Hoylake's takeover terms, yet the British takeover panel forbids a formal offer 
for BAT Industries until Farmers' change of ownership wins U.S. regulatory 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing this quandary, Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers allowed 
Goldsmith to let his original bid lapse until he obtained U.S. regulatory 
clearances. He then would have 21 days to renew the offer and 60 days to 
complete the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake, however, is interested only in BAT's tobacco business. Consequently, 
it agreed to sell Farmers to Axa Midi as soon as it succeeded in taking over 
BAT. In turn, Axa Midi agreed to invest $1 billion in Hoylake's takeover 
venture and to pay it $4.5 billion for Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Bebear accused BAT of "holding Farmers' policyholders hostage." 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear," he went on, "that BAT instigated the call for additional 
information on the bid even though the takeover panel had not required it. BAT 
wants to frustrate the hearing process in the U.S. as long as possible and, by 
doing so, is only hurting Farmers." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Farmers characterized the additional information that Hoylake 
submitted Thursday in an effort to placate U.S. regulators as "a debt-laden, 
hypothetical scheme." Those terms, based on current market conditions and BAT's 
current holdings, would amount to $13.60 a share or $20.6 billion, making it 
second in magnitude only to the $25-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco.

HOUSING STARTS REBOUND 12% IN BIGGEST JUMP SINCE 1986 
</P>

<P>
Housing starts bounced back 12% in October from September's seven-year low, the 
Commerce Department reported Friday, and analysts said they expect the 
construction rate to remain stable through the first quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
New home construction rebounded to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.42 million 
units for the biggest gain in three years, following September's extremely weak 
1.27-million rate. 
</P>
<P>
The October jump, the biggest since a 13% rise in December, 1986, left housing 
starts far above economists' expectations of a 1.30-million-unit rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very welcome number and brings us back to July levels," said economist 
Dave Seiders of the National Assn. of Home Builders. "I was really getting 
worried about where housing was headed." 
</P>
<P>
Housing starts react quickly to changes in interest rates and are a leading 
indicator of activity in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the October rise left housing starts near a healthy average of 
1.40 million units this year, offering reassurance that September's steep fall 
was nothing more than an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"The September figure led you to believe the housing industry was going down 
the tubes, but that's simply not the case," said economist Richard Peach of the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Building permits in October rose nearly 1% to 1.33 million, indicating that 
home building activity will likely be sustained in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rebound in housing from the depressed levels of August and 
September could help keep the economy on a slow-growth course and away from 
recession, when other sectors such as autos and basic industry are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"New residential home investment will provide stimulus to the economy in the 
fourth quarter," Peach said. 
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the economy to slow in the months ahead, leading to a gradual 
easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But continued growth in some 
sectors, such as housing, will prevent a dramatic shift in Fed policy. 
</P>
<P>
Housing construction weakened last spring because of high interest rates, but 
the industry showed signs of strength in June and July. The summer gains 
dwindled in August and the decline accelerated in September. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term mortgage rates are now around 9.79%, compared to a high of around 
10.22% in September, but consumers have still shied away from making major 
purchases of homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of new homes plunged 14% in September, while October retail sales 
contracted by 1% -- the result of a drop in auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
But lower interest rates are spurring the construction industry to build more 
homes, economists said. Single-family housing starts rose 6.9%, while new 
apartment building construction increased 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Housing starts were strong in all regions of the country, rising 6% in the 
Northeast, 16.5% in the Midwest, 17.1% in the South and 5.1% in the West.

REGULATORS PLANNING TO RESTRICT DUAL TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal agency that regulates the nation's futures exchanges said Friday 
that it will ask those exchanges to restrict the controversial practice of dual 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also released its long-awaited study 
of dual trading, which involves traders who execute trades for themselves and 
their customers on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that dual traders are not "a critical ingredient in providing 
liquidity and low-cost trade execution." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of dual trading, which is not illegal, claim that it poses 
conflict-of-interest problems for traders who might try to make a profit 
trading for themselves ahead of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
This practice, known as front-running, is banned. 
</P>
<P>
Front-running is among the many fraud schemes alleged in the indictments of 
more than 40 traders at the nation's two-largest futures exchanges in Chicago 
this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the study, as well as on the Chicago indictments, the CFTC said its 
staff was preparing "proposed rules that would require exchanges to restrict 
dual trading on a provisional, phased-in basis." 
</P>
<P>
CFTC Chief Economist Steven Manaster said, however, that developing those rules 
"will be a lengthy process." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Dual trading exists in all markets," the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said in a 
prepared statement, adding that the exchange "after its own study, has proposed 
to deal with any real or perceived problems with dual trading through the 
enhancement of the audit trail. Both the House and Senate have also adopted 
this approach." 
</P>
<P>
An audit trail is an anti-fraud device to reconstruct a trade to determine when 
it occurred and who was involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We will review the CFTC's report on dual trading and make comments to any 
proposed rules at the appropriate time," the CME statement concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified 
price at a certain time in the future. Futures contracts are used by producers 
of such commodities as soybeans or gold to lock in a favorable price down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
And speculators, in turn, buy and sell those contracts to profit from 
constantly changing price differences. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of dual trading claim it helps keep trading costs down and keeps the 
markets liquid when there is little trading, especially in small, low-volume 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been argued that dual traders might be superior providers of liquidity 
or that dual traders might be superior in terms providing customer service and 
on that basis were kind of super traders -- they were absolutely essential to 
whatever was going on in these markets," Manaster said. 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the 47-page study, conducted by the CFTC's Division of 
Economic Analysis, found that the "vast majority" of dual traders tend to 
specialize in trading either for themselves or for their customers. Dual 
trading is really a sideline for most floor traders, constituting only about 
10% or less of their business. 
</P>
<P>
The study also found that: 
</P>
<P>
* There is no statistical support for claims that dual trading increases in 
low-volume months; 
</P>
<P>
* Dual traders "do not, on average" get better quality trades for their 
customers than brokers who trade only for customers. 
</P>
<P>
* Dual traders do not help make the market any more liquid than "exclusive 
traders," or those who don't engage in dual trading.

ELITE GROUP REAPED PROFIT OF $7.3 MILLION AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Los Angeles Airport Department program to help minorities and women develop 
business skills has instead helped a small group with political connections to 
reap $7.3 million in profits for little or no work, according to a city report 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who profited was Betty Dixon, wife of House Ethics Committee 
Chairman Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who has made at least $499,408 over the 
last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon became involved in the program after she and her husband attended a 
Washington party held by Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd., which has contracts to 
operate at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a report by the city 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of 10 minorities and women selected by Duty Free Shoppers to 
participate in a joint venture intended to satisfy city demands for increased 
involvement of women and minorities at airport concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Another eight women and minorities were selected to participate in a joint 
venture with Host International Inc., which operates concessions at LAX and 
Ontario Airport. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was clergyman H. H. Brookins, a politically active African 
Methodist Episcopal bishop who helped launch Mayor Tom Bradley's political 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins received at least $296,840 over the last four years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
His share was five times that of the other Host partners, even though he was 
"not involved in any way with the management or operations of the partnership 
or facilities" and did not attend management meetings, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 minority and female partners brought in by Host and Duty Free Shoppers 
have made an estimated profit of $7.3 million since 1986 after investing 
virtually no money of their own and performing little or no work, the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the profits went to Host and Duty Free Shoppers in return for ownership 
shares in the companies, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly not what the mayor and council intended," said Keith Comrie, 
the city's administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo requested the report last summer after reports in 
The Times disclosed problems with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Friday that women and minorities "were betrayed" and that he will hold 
hearings next month about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Host International and DFS (Duty Free Shoppers) apparently used those people 
as window dressing in a cynical attempt to manipulate the process," Woo said. 
"The vital goal of encouraging women and minorities in business was subverted." 
</P>
<P>
William Foss, senior vice president and general manager of Duty Free Shops, 
said Friday: "It has always been our position that we tried to meet city goals 
with regard to minority and women involvement." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was difficult to find women and minorities with sufficient 
experience to take over a large percentage of the company's airport business. 
The company intended to involve the partners in a gradual learning process, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon and Brookins could not be reached for comment. Officials of Host 
International did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures were started in 1986 and 1987 when the city began a push to 
increase minority participation closer to the airport goal of 20% minority and 
12% women, the report said. The airport commission encouraged the creation of 
joint ventures for that purpose. Previously, the prime airport concessionaires 
had hired minority and female subcontractors in an attempt to meet the goals. 
</P>
<P>
But the limited partnerships were "arrangements contrived primarily" to "meet 
the numbers" rather than the "spirit of business development" that was supposed 
to be the objective, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures can become "a very murky arrangement whereby minority names and 
reputations are 'rented' to meet government agency requirements without real 
participation of the individual partners," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Subcontracting, on the other hand, clearly defines the work to be done and the 
payment for services. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Host and Duty Free Shoppers nor the minority partners would provide 
financial data, citing the competitive nature of the business, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The profit estimates in the report were described as "very conservative" 
because they are based on gross sales figures from the early months of the 
joint ventures. Duty Free gross sales have increased from a monthly average of 
$4 million in 1986 to $7 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Duty Free Shops has yet to turn over operations of duty-free facilities in 
Terminals 3 and 5 at LAX to the minority and female participants, even though 
the 1986 joint venture agreement requires it. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that detailed guidelines be set up for the program to 
avoid such problems in the future.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KAUFMAN WILL RETIRE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: HE SERVED ON STATE HIGH COURT LESS THAN THREE YEARS. WANTS TO SPEND 
TIME WITH FAMILY, HE SAYS.

<P>
Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, a conservative, outspoken and sometimes 
unpredictable member of the California Supreme Court, announced Friday he will 
retire at the end of January after less than three years on the court. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian, Kaufman, 60, cited a "myriad of personal 
reasons" for stepping down -- primarily a desire to spend more time with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The justice, sworn in as a member of the high court in March, 1987, after 17 
years on the state Court of Appeal, noted that he had undergone surgery for 
colon cancer two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"While follow-up tests have all been excellent, such an experience brings one 
face to face with the fact of our mortality and argues persuasively against 
continuing in work so demanding that little time exists for family life or 
recreation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman's retirement had been widely rumored in recent months but the justice 
had declined comment until Friday. He is the second Deukmejian appointee to 
decide to retire after relatively brief service on the Supreme Court. Last 
March, Justice John A. Arguelles stepped down at age 61 after two years on the 
high court and 25 years on the state judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
By retiring in January, Kaufman will have completed 20 years as a judge and 
thus be eligible for enhanced pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
It will also enable Deukmejian to choose a like-minded and perhaps younger 
successor who could serve far longer. The governor thus could leave his imprint 
on the high court for many years beyond his own tenure, which will end in 
January, 1991, after eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian followed this pattern when he selected Appellate Justice Joyce L. 
Kennard, now 48, to succeed Arguelles earlier this year. Legal authorities say 
the governor is likely to consider such candidates as Ronald M. George, 49, and 
Reuben A. Ortega, 47, both former prosecutors and trial court judges now 
serving as justices on the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
When Deukmejian was seeking a successor for Arguelles, he also considered 
Appellate Justices H. Walter Croskey, 56, Los Angeles; Fred H. Marler, 57, 
Sacramento; and Patricia D. Benke, 40, San Diego. Benke, however, was reluctant 
to move or commute to the court's headquarters in San Francisco from her home 
and may no longer be in the running for the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever the governor does choose is not likely to have a dramatic impact on the 
philosophical balance of the court. For decades dominated by judicial liberals, 
the court underwent a marked ideological shift after the 1986 election in which 
the voters refused to retain three court liberals -- Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird and Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph R. Grodin. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor then named Kaufman, Arguelles and Justice David N. 
Eagleson to the court. While its voting alignment often shifts from case to 
case, the court generally is viewed as including five Deukmejian-appointed 
conservatives -- including Kaufman, Kennard, Eagleson, Chief Justice Malcolm M. 
Lucas and Justice Edward A. Panelli -- and two liberals, Justices Stanley Mosk 
and Allen E. Broussard, appointed by Democratic Govs. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and 
Edmund G. Brown Jr., respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman was expected to be among the most conservative of the Deukmejian 
appointees, but he has proved to be something of a judicial maverick. While 
frequently joining the majority in upholding the death penalty and limiting the 
rights of criminal defendants, he broke ranks and joined liberals in some 
important civil rulings. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote majority opinions when the court permitted police to erect roadblocks 
to catch drunk drivers and allowed a corporate farm to restrict the access of 
union organizers to workers camps on its property. 
</P>
<P>
But he disagreed with far-reaching high court rulings that restricted 
wrongful-termination suits against employers and barred the use of state 
antitrust laws against corporate mergers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kaufman's been an independent, free-thinking justice, pretty much at the 
center of the court," said UC Berkeley law professor Stephen R. Barnett, a 
close observer of the justices. "He's been a bundle of sometimes conflicting 
streaks . . . He's backed the little guy against employers, unions, the 
government, the State Bar and even a church. On the other side, he has showed 
sympathy for insurers and growers he apparently thinks were victims of liberal 
bias." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett speculated that Kaufman's retirement could be linked, at least in part, 
to the court's heavy backlog of death penalty cases. While the court under 
Lucas has trimmed its overall caseload from 382 to 314, the number of capital 
cases pending has increased from 171 to 180. Although the justices have worked 
hard to decide such cases -- issuing 60 death-penalty affirmations and 24 
reversals in little more than two years -- capital appeals continue to stream 
into the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Like other court experts, Barnett gave high marks to the craftsmanship of 
Kaufman's writing and research. But he also cited a "streak of intemperance" in 
some opinions and Kaufman's sometimes relentless and bellicose questioning of 
attorneys before the court. "The scholarly quality of his opinions has been 
high, but he would have benefitted from lowering his voice, both during oral 
argument and in some of his writing," the professor said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent opinion, Kaufman issued one of the sharpest attacks in memory, 
criticizing a dissent by Broussard that had accused the majority of failing to 
show "any awareness" of the impact of its rulings on jury selection and racial 
bias. Kaufman accused Broussard of an unjustifiable attack "on the motives and 
integrity" of the court and of violating a judicial tradition of avoiding 
personal accusations in opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Kaufman's feisty questions and opinions contrast sharply with his 
open and friendly manner off the bench. For example, less than a week after he 
strongly criticized Broussard, he was seen chatting amiably with Broussard at a 
public appearance the justices made at Santa Clara University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, in a statement, hailed Kaufman's written opinions as "consistently 
concise yet complete, compassionate yet practical." Kaufman's questions during 
oral argument are "keen, incisive, provocative and stimulating," the chief 
justice said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to Justice Kaufman for all his endeavors, and I wish him a 
successful and prolonged retirement," Lucas said. "He certainly has earned it." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Deukmejian, Kaufman said he hoped the governor would appoint a 
successor within 30 days of the justice's retirement. Kaufman added that he 
would stay on the court beyond that time, by special assignment, to complete 
work on pending cases in which he has participated. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor was unavailable for comment. But 
it was believed that, as in the past, Deukmejian will send a list of potential 
candidates for a non-binding review and evaluation by a special commission of 
the State Bar and then select one of those candidates as his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's choice then would be sent to the state Judicial Appointments 
Commission, made up of Lucas, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Justice 
Lester W. Roth, senior presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal. If 
confirmed, as is likely, the nominee would be sworn into office. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman acknowledged that the work on the court had been "arduous" but he 
praised his colleagues and the court staff for helping make his tenure "the 
most thrilling, stimulating professional experience of my life." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no definite plans, but hoped to perform some writing, teaching 
and practice of law. He added that he plans to "speak out occasionally on 
issues of significance" involving the court and the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lucas' tenure, there has been "much progress" in the morale and attitude 
of the justices and their staffs, Kaufman said. "In large measure public 
respect for and confidence in the court has been restored, and I am very proud 
to think that I have played some small part in that important achievement." 
</P>
<P>
The justice added, however, that the court was being deprived of "essential 
facilities and amenities." Since the Oct. 17 earthquake, the court's work had 
been disrupted and the justices have been left with "even less adequate 
quarters than before," he said.

SENATE VOTES ITSELF ONLY A 9.7% PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Differing from the House, the Senate on Friday approved a 9.7% pay increase for 
itself but went along with a raise of nearly 40% for federal judges and top 
officials of the executive branch. The vote was 56 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the votes to approve the same salary increase -- to about $125,000 -- 
that the House had approved for its members by a wide margin Thursday, the 
Senate's leadership settled instead for a raise of $8,700 to bring senators' 
salaries to $98,200 next January. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was returned to the House late Friday night so that it could be 
given final approval and sent to the President for his signature. As a result 
of the Senate's action, House members will be paid more than U.S. senators 
starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than join the House in banning speech-making honorariums after 1990, the 
Senate decided to lower the limit on this form of income for senators from the 
current $35,800 to $27,100 next year. It would be lowered dollar for dollar as 
the Senate pay goes up under annual automatic cost-of-living raises. Those 
raises will be geared to the rate of inflation and cannot exceed 5%. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared to be a stinging defeat for the Senate leadership. Lamenting the 
outcome, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that the Senate lacked the courage shown by the House. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) accused fellow senators of "cowardice" for 
refusing to take the political risk of supporting the House pay-ethics package, 
adding: "We don't have the courage of our true convictions . . . to do what is 
right for this institution. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created by virtue of our cowardice an inequity," Byrd said. "We are 
saying we are not worth as much as our colleagues in the House." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal originally placed before the Senate -- carrying the same increases 
and elimination of honorariums that the House had approved for itself -- was 
withdrawn by Mitchell when he realized that it would be defeated if brought to 
a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), who said that the package was three votes short 
of a majority, bitterly charged that some of his colleagues were "phony" for 
opposing a pay increase but privately hoping that it would be passed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of cheerful people here today who said, 'I hope you all will 
jump off the cliff and we'll get the money,' " Simpson complained. 
</P>
<P>
California's two senators split on the pay issue. Democrat Alan Cranston voted 
for the scaled-back raise and Republican Pete Wilson, who is quitting the 
Senate to run for governor, voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unusual procedures for consideration of the pay legislation, the 
House and the Senate each voted on its own salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The House legislation, which was passed 252 to 174, would provide its members 
with a 7.7% cost-of-living pay increase next January, followed by a 25% raise 
in January, 1991, and another automatic increase of about 3% to offset the 
impact of inflation. This would bring their salaries from the current level of 
$89,500 to about $125,000 in 13 months. Judges and Administration officials 
will get the same increase. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Dole won a series of procedural maneuvers earlier in the day that 
blocked any delay in the vote on a pay raise and prevented a move to knock out 
the pay raise entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) predicted that the Senate would wind up with 
"the worst of both worlds -- with no pay increase and no honoraria." After 
Mitchell withdrew the original proposal and the fallback plan was introduced, 
little was heard from opponents of the pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
The most vocal opponent of the raise was Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who 
protested that it was the "wrong thing to do, in the wrong way, at the wrong 
time." 
</P>
<P>
In the preliminary voting, a bipartisan majority crushed attempts by Helms to 
delay a vote until next February or to keep senators' pay at its current level. 
Helms protested in vain that the complex legislation, which filled more than 
150 pages, was not made available to senators before the debate began and was 
being rammed through the Senate before taxpayers had a chance to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"I implore the Senate not to proceed," Helms said. "Give the public -- the 
people who pay our salaries -- a fair opportunity to make up their own minds." 
</P>
<P>
But his motion to delay consideration of the pay and ethics proposal until Feb. 
1 was defeated by a vote of 88 to 11. Moments later, the Senate voted by an 
overwhelming 90 to 9 to shut off debate, averting a possible filibuster attempt 
by the North Carolina lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
On another amendment to strike the pay increases from the bill and allow the 
acceptance of speech honorariums to continue, Helms lost on a vote of 65 to 34.

PANEL URGES MORE TRIBAL CONTROL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Individual tribes should be allowed to assume control of Indian affairs 
programs administered by the government as a way to end "massive fraud, 
corruption and mismanagement" by the federal officials who oversee them, a 
Senate panel recommended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the product of a two-year investigation by the investigations unit 
of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, disclosed widespread abuses by the 
federal agencies assigned to oversee existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
The panel reported that federal officials knew of possible oil theft from 
Indians but refused to stop it, hired teachers at reservation schools despite 
known records of sexual abuse of children and failed to heed warnings that 
minority contracting programs were dominated by fraudulent shell companies. 
</P>
<P>
Committee investigators also documented kickbacks and other illegal financial 
dealings by some tribal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do American Indians, but the American taxpayer as well, suffer from 
this extreme waste," said Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the investigations 
unit chairman. "Year after year, all American taxpayers must foot the bill for 
a negligent and unresponsive bureaucracy from a limited federal budget." 
</P>
<P>
The report, which advocates a "New Federalism for American Indians," proposes 
that individual tribes negotiate agreements with the President to establish 
self-governing bodies that will function "in the same sense as state 
governments." 
</P>
<P>
For those tribes that reach such agreements, the government would provide 
tribal officials with an annual entitlement grant equal to the amount that the 
tribe would have received through existing federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
The grants would be used by the tribal governments to provide services for 
their members. In return, the tribes would be accountable to a constitution 
ratified by a majority of all adult tribal members. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Interior Department, which supervises the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs and administers the federal government's $3.3-billion Indian affairs 
budget, said they had not yet read the report. But they praised the committee 
for its work and noted that agency officials already are working with Indian 
tribes to achieve self government. 
</P>
<P>
"The report reflects a trend currently growing stronger within tribal 
communities -- the assumption of greater self-determination by tribal 
governments," said Eddie Frank Brown, assistant Interior secretary for Indian 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The special report is harshly critical of the government's current supervision 
of Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Paternalistic federal control over American Indians has created a federal 
bureaucracy ensnarled in red tape and riddled with fraud, mismanagement and 
waste," the report said. "Worse, the committee found that federal officials in 
every agency knew of the abuses but did little to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said that congressional intervention is necessary to stem the abuses, 
adding that he would send draft legislation to the Select Committee on Indian 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said that not all of the $3.3 billion annually earmarked for Indian 
programs reaches the nation's Indian population. "In fact, the total household 
income for American Indians from all sources, including the federal government, 
is actually less than the entire federal budget of $3.3 billion," DeConcini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the panel's recommendations were adopted, the Bureau of Indian Affairs would 
continue to provide services to those tribes that chose not to switch to 
self-governance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that as tribes negotiate agreements and began to receive 
direct federal grants, the Bureau of Indian Affairs would play a smaller role 
in tribal affairs.

SHEVARDNADZE BACKS REFORM IN EAST BLOC; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: 'BOLD, INNOVATIVE STEPS' ARE BOTH NECESSARY AND GOOD, HE TELLS 
LEGISLATORS. 
</P>

<P>
With concern starting to show in the Soviet Union about the fast-paced changes 
in Eastern Europe, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze reassured lawmakers 
here Friday that the reforms are both necessary and good for East Germany, 
Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland as well as the other members of the Warsaw Pact -- 
and the future of socialism itself. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze assured the Soviet Union's neighbors of its support in the reforms 
and warned that any attempt to forestall the changes would bring a renewal of 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to hail the bold, innovative steps of the German Democratic Republic 
(East Germany)," he told the foreign policy committees of the Supreme Soviet, 
the country's legislature. "They meet the interests of socialism, of Europe as 
a whole, of the East German people and of the Warsaw Pact. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We support the course of the renewal of democracy in the German Democratic 
Republic and wish our friends and allies success." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently rebutting legislators who asked why the Soviet allies could not 
merely modernize past policies, Shevardnadze said the countries of Eastern 
Europe are beginning the process of "a deep renewal of socialism," just as the 
Soviet Union had with its reform program, known as perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes are logical and historically justified," he said. "What is now 
taking place is the democratization, the renewal of socialism and the 
realization of people's right to a free choice." 
</P>
<P>
In affirming the Soviet Union's desire to see such fundamental changes, 
Shevardnadze went further in his policy review than past statements had in 
making it clear that Moscow is, in fact, pushing the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding democracy and freedom as solely Western values is utter arrogance, a 
'Western delusion of grandeur,' " he continued. "Universal human values cannot 
be reduced just to Western ones." 
</P>
<P>
Socialist countries are proceeding with the reforms based on the "new political 
thinking" that underlies long-term changes in Soviet foreign policy, new cuts 
in armaments and the feeling of greater security that stemmed from these 
factors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union has supported the reforms from the outset, their 
rapid spread through much of Eastern Europe has brought fears of instability in 
a region that Moscow considers to be its front yard, as well as fears of a 
possible collapse that would jeopardize perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland's stability is a factor in our national security, and we must promote 
its stabilization," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
But Shevardnadze told the legislative committees that Poland's coalition 
government, which is led by Solidarity, emerged from free elections last summer 
and that it has a popular base. 
</P>
<P>
"The people made their choice," he said, recalling that Solidarity had defeated 
many Communist candidates from the Polish United Workers Party. "The government 
has been recognized, and it is respected by the Polish United Workers Party. 
So, we have no grounds for not respecting the Polish government." 
</P>
<P>
But he felt some uneasiness last month, Shevardnadze conceded, as he traveled 
to "quite a different Warsaw" for a meeting of the Warsaw Pact's foreign 
ministers. "And it was quite unusual to hear 'Mister' rather than 'Comrade' 
during the discussions at that meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Answering criticism from Soviet conservatives about the danger posed to 
socialism by the reforms, Shevardnadze warned that "it is impossible to return 
to the ideological stereotypes of the past -- we would be very close to a new 
Cold War at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's meeting with President Bush 
aboard Soviet and American warships off Malta on Dec. 2-3, Shevardnadze 
predicted that the discussions will speed changes in the nature of relations 
between the two superpowers toward those based on good will and cooperation 
rather than rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting will proceed without a fixed agenda, and there are no plans to 
sign any agreements," Shevardnadze said.

POPE, GORBACHEV TO HOLD TALKS AT VATICAN ON DEC. 1

Pope John Paul II and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet at the 
Vatican on Dec. 1 for talks that could lead the Kremlin to legalize the banned 
Ukrainian Catholic Church and invite the Pope to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, announced by the Vatican in a brief statement Friday, will be the 
first between a Kremlin leader and a pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican sources said the meeting, which will immediately precede Gorbachev's 
two-day shipboard summit with President Bush off Malta, is expected to last 
about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, issued with the forthcoming meeting clearly in mind, 
the Vatican called on Moscow to recognize the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which 
dictator Josef Stalin forcibly merged with the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Its estimated 5 million faithful have since been forced to worship underground. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever may have been the difficulties and tensions of the past, a spirit of 
forgiveness and reconciliation must reign which will allow Christians to bear 
witness together to their faith and its requirements," the Vatican statement 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in exile of the Ukrainian church said in September that the Vatican has 
made a papal meeting with Gorbachev conditional on Soviet willingness to 
discuss legalization of the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
They say John Paul would like to visit the Soviet Union in 1992 if the church 
is legalized. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish-born Pope has often said he would like to visit the Soviet Union if 
he is allowed to visit Catholic areas such as the Ukraine, Lithuania and 
Latvia.

BUSH REASSURES MOSCOW ON EAST EUROPE;

DIPLOMACY: THE U.S. WON'T USE THE REFORM MOVEMENT TO DESTABILIZE THE SOVIET

President Bush, continuing his preparations for next month's summit with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sent Gorbachev a cable expressing his support 
for "calm and peaceful" change in Eastern Europe, his spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also continued a series of meetings with U.S. experts on Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's cable Thursday night was a response to a message he received last 
weekend from the Soviet president that expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"The President indicated his support for the changes in Eastern Europe and the 
reforms under way in the Soviet Union," Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, 
said. "He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period of change in 
Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seek to implement their 
reforms. The President said he believes these historic steps will make a 
positive contribution to a Europe that is whole and free." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's cable was designed to reassure Gorbachev that the United States does not 
plan to take advantage of the rapid reforms in Eastern Europe to try to 
destabilize the Soviet Union. The Administration's hope is that such reassuring 
messages can help Gorbachev fend off his internal critics and continue his 
reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials believe that Gorbachev can hold on to power as long as 
the Soviet military and the nation's other major institutions of power do not 
see the reform process as a fundamental threat to the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a message apparently intended to pay heed to concerns of the 
Administration's conservative supporters, Vice President Dan Quayle warned 
Friday that approaching technological developments and financial limits "will 
profoundly affect the U.S.-Soviet military competition." 
</P>
<P>
While reduced defense spending may bring the size of the Soviet military into 
balance with the United States, "Soviet forces may well become more competitive 
in qualitative terms," Quayle said in a speech to the National Defense 
University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking hard about basic questions of strategy is all the more necessary as 
we enter an era that in some ways will be more complex and challenging than the 
era now passing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on other critics, meanwhile, White House aides increasingly have tried 
to fend off suggestions from Democratic leaders in Congress that Bush has been 
too passive in his summit preparations. They insist that Bush will not go to 
the Malta summit with a set of new initiatives and that he does not expect the 
summit to lead immediately to new agreements with the Soviets.

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of young protesters filled the cobblestone square as dusk gathered 
Friday in the heart of East Berlin, where anti-government banners flapped in an 
icy November wind. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a student festooned with plastic bananas appeared in the crowd and 
blew on a rusty bugle. 
</P>
<P>
"The revolution," he shouted, "is going shopping." 
</P>
<P>
And even as the protesters marched through the capital demanding reforms, 
hundreds of their comrades were marching out. 
</P>
<P>
Out and then back -- with Batman souvenirs and bags of oranges, radios, albums 
and other goodies from the newly accessible West. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the day-trippers of the East Bloc: While more than 200,000 East Germans 
have fled to West Germany for good, the vast majority are just browsing, thank 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Schmeka, a 19-year-old political science student from Brandenburg, spent 
several hours in West Berlin with a group of friends on the first day that East 
Germany threw open its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, he "looked and looked and looked," then ate some chocolate 
cupcakes, bought 12 pounds of oranges and came happily home. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my place," Schmeka said while sipping espresso in a nearly empty East 
Berlin coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no desire to live over there," he said. "There's unemployment and crime 
. . . people who are too poor and people who are too rich. If I leave, I can't 
change things here." 
</P>
<P>
What needs changing, say East Germans who stayed behind, is not only the 
political system but the economy as well. 
</P>
<P>
State subsidies keep the cost of living artificially low here. The average 
monthly salary is about 1,300 marks, or about $725. Apartments often rent for 
less than 5% of that. 
</P>
<P>
West Berliners come over here to go to the barber shop or to a beauty parlor, 
said Roberto Coselli, concierge at the swank Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Perms cost only 30 marks here, compared to 85 or 90 in West Berlin," he said, 
"and when you figure that West Berliners change money on the black market at a 
rate of 10 East marks for one West, instead of our official one-for-one rate, 
well, it ends up costing you about the same as a bunch of bananas over there, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
Paper Money 
</P>
<P>
East German marks are virtually worthless abroad, which is partly why West 
Germany gives 100 marks spending money to every East German on his or her first 
visit. East Germans are allowed to exchange only 15 marks per year in their own 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Living can be cheap here. It costs only pennies to ride a bus or subway, and 
grocery shelves appear well stocked with affordable food of acceptable quality. 
A five-pound sack of potatoes costs less than 25 cents. A frozen chicken runs 
the equivalent of about $2. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, tropical fruit, coffee and many fresh vegetables are scarce 
or costly. East Germany must compete with capitalist countries that pay hard 
currency for, say, oranges from Spain or bell peppers from Holland. A pound of 
coffee costs the same here as dinner for two at a nice restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The only bananas to be found in a bustling East Berlin supermarket are tiny 
packets of brown, dried bananas imported from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"They taste terrible," said one frowning shopper. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans must apply 12 to 16 years in advance for a small Soviet-made car, 
wait 10 years for a telephone and up to 20 years for an apartment. But hospital 
visits, child care and education are free. 
</P>
<P>
Boutiques on the fashionable boulevard Unten den Linden offer a narrow 
selection of what East Germans consider luxuries -- a simple crepe blouse for a 
quarter of a month's salary, a bottle of French after-shave for about six days' 
work. It takes five months' salary to pay for a color television. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, many East Germans note hopefully, change is coming faster than 
anyone ever expected. 
</P>
<P>
And the good mood is actually visible in the capital. Border police now crack 
jokes with the same people who, not so long ago, they had orders to shoot for 
any attempt to flee to the West. 
</P>
<P>
East Berliners chat amiably with the foreign journalists who swarm over their 
city -- the same ones they would have been forced to shun less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be so crabby and nasty," admitted Manfred Haedler, chief dramatist 
for Berlin's German State Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"But the tension isn't there any more. Now there's just so much hope and 
optimism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the freedom to travel for the first time in 28 years means, as one 
teen-age shop girl put it, "the freedom to dream." 
</P>
<P>
A bellhop dreams of showing his family the tulip fields in Holland next spring, 
while an economist has promised his wife a second honeymoon in Paris. A college 
student can't decide between Australia and the American West. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is, our money is basically worthless abroad," said a teacher who 
quickly spent her 100-mark gift on her first trip to West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns didn't trouble a silver-haired grandfather joining Friday's 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes me so proud," the man said as he waded into the crowd. "We Germans 
have never finished a revolution before, and I think we're finally going to see 
one through. A bloodless revolution, but a real revolution."

BIG WELCOME BEGINS TO WEAR ON WALESA; 
</P>
<P>
POLAND: SOLIDARITY'S CHAMPION IS FINDING THAT BEING AMERICA'S HERO CAN BE A BIT 
MUCH. HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU SAY THANKS?

<P>
The full weight of a New York welcome descended Friday upon a travel-weary Lech 
Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders and politicians at a Manhattan breakfast bestowed upon him caps, 
pins, cliches -- (". . . You scrapped the Iron Curtain and forged it into a 
train of freedom," one steelworker told him) -- and even a set of electrician's 
tools in tribute to his workingman's roots. 
</P>
<P>
And yet it is all growing a bit taxing on Walesa, who's been on a whirlwind 
debut tour of America since Monday and is to appear at a City Hall rally in 
Chicago today. 
</P>
<P>
You can hear it in his voice, the way his grammar slips, say Poles who watch 
him. You can also see the way he wipes his face with his hand, trying to bring 
it to life, as he sits and listens to others praise him. He jokes 
half-seriously that it was a lot easier being a worker. How many times can he 
say thanks? How many ways? 
</P>
<P>
Standing Ovations 
</P>
<P>
In Washington and New York, Walesa protests through his translator that he is 
not sure he deserves the accolades, the standing ovations, the visible crush of 
love that awaits him at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if this is owed to me," he said Friday morning to a small New York 
state labor audience in a hotel banquet room before rushing a few blocks over 
to meet with leaders of New York's Jewish community, and then later to a Polish 
newspaper. "Really, it is not. In all those achievements you are 99 cents. I am 
only the last cent that creates a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
The night before, he had found another way of saying it to the International 
Rescue Committee, which aids political refugees. I only drive the winning race 
car, he said. Many others build it. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting a few feet away as Walesa spoke was New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who 
stood to tell a story that captivated Walesa and shattered any celebrity ennui 
that might have begun to plague him. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that last June, two teachers from the education section of Walesa's 
Solidarity movement met Cuomo in New York and asked him to recommend American 
writings on democracy for use in Polish classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Easy, said the governor. Read Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no books about Lincoln in Poland, the teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
Simple, said the governor. We'll have an English anthology on Lincoln's 
statements about democracy translated into Polish and ship it to you. 
</P>
<P>
Not so simple. 
</P>
<P>
For all the writings on Lincoln, his words on democracy had never been 
collected in one place. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, making use of a state "international partnership" program and corporate 
donations, appointed a widely published Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer, to 
collate Lincoln's words. Seven historians were contacted to write essays for 
the book, and another 33 historians recommended which works should be chosen. 
So far they have recommended 139 speeches, letters and conversations. The book 
will be published -- in English as well as in Polish -- next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The book, "Lincoln on Democracy," which may be published in Hungarian, German 
and Czechoslovak, "is our small tribute to Lech Walesa," Cuomo said. "To the 
idea of not quitting . . . for reminding us that democracy has to be worked for 
. . . for reminding us that we still must aspire." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa rose again. "This makes me feel even more warm," he said, an expression 
he frequently uses to express gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you will be able to keep pace with the other (East European) 
languages," Walesa said, "because the line is forming already."

ROMANIA SEALS ITS BORDER, HUNGARY SAYS

Romania has sealed its border with reformist Hungary, Budapest Radio reported 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Information received so far confirms that nowhere along the Hungarian-Romanian 
border can the frontier be crossed," the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The development highlighted Romania's increasing isolation within Eastern 
Europe, swept by reformist winds that hard-line Romanian Communist leader 
Nicolae Ceausescu is resisting. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest Radio said travelers were being sent back unjustifiably by the 
Romanian side at five main crossing points -- Nagylak, Lokoshaza, Kotegyan, 
Biharkeresztes and Gyula. 
</P>
<P>
"The Romanians have not informed the Hungarian side about the reason for this," 
the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
It speculated that the sealing of the frontier might be a precaution linked to 
a congress of the Romanian Communist Party scheduled for Monday in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that the government, bucking a tide of political and 
economic reform in the Soviet Bloc, was taking measures to prevent any upheaval 
during the five-day party congress. 
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the congress is approval of a five-year economic plan, as well 
as the election of the Central Committee, the Politburo and the party leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday issue of the Communist Party daily Scinteia quoted the 71-year old 
Ceausescu, whose 24 years at the helm of Romania make him the longest-serving 
Soviet Bloc leader, in comments that presaged the tenor of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
In a blanket condemnation of reforms as violating "the basic principles of 
socialism," Ceausescu also accused "reactionary circles" of exploiting 
confusion in the Communist camp. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian diplomats in Vienna said Ceausescu is expected to endorse continuation 
of the status quo Monday in a keynote speech at the opening of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Romania, which owed foreign banks and governments $11 billion in 1981, declared 
itself debt-free last spring after an accelerated program of producing for 
export that left store shelves bare.

NEW BULGARIA CHIEF BACKS 'FREE' VOTING; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: OUSTED LEADER ZHIVKOV IS DENOUNCED FOR CORRUPTION 'GREATER THAN THE 
BULGARIAN CZARS.'

<P>
Joining the trend established in other Eastern European countries, new 
Bulgarian leader Petar Mladenov said Friday that he supports "free elections" 
and an independent Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It was not entirely clear, however, from his brief remarks to reporters if 
Mladenov meant free, multi-party elections like those found in the West. Some 
members of his government interpreted his words to mean elections within the 
framework of the Communist-affiliated Fatherland Front, a combination of 
Communist and so-called agrarian parties here. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a meeting of the National Assembly where Mladenov was confirmed 
as head of state, former Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov was denounced for 
corruption "greater than the Bulgarian czars," including the construction of 
more than 30 lavish private residences with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly also voted to repeal a law that had been used 
to jail political prisoners under the Zhivkov regime. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, a large rally called by the government to show support for 
Mladenov was partially taken over by groups seeking even more radical reforms, 
including the expulsion of three members of the Mladenov ruling council, or 
Politburo, who served in the Zhivkov government. During the rally, a police car 
was surrounded by several hundred demonstrators, some carrying signs calling 
for "Less Police, More Democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The radical turn taken at the government-sponsored rally, which was supposed to 
be a staid, patriotic demonstration mainly attended by government workers, 
buoyed hopes in the small Bulgarian opposition, which plans its own 
demonstration today. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the fading light Friday, demonstrators staged a brief sit-in on 
the pavement in front of the Communist Party headquarters here. As they marched 
past the building housing the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, many people 
booed. 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the demonstration, more than 15,000 people were packed into the 
small square in front of the National Assembly building, and the crowd spilled 
into side streets. The government estimated the crowd at 100,000, hoping to 
steal some thunder from today's planned opposition rally as teams of 
international television crews began to arrive here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although still small in scale in comparison to the upheavals in other East 
European countries, particularly Poland, Hungary and East Germany, the events 
here in Sofia on Friday showed a new depth of support for reform, both on the 
part of the new government and on the part of the several thousand 
demonstrators in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
In a place never celebrated for its spontaneity and joyous street life, a mix 
of residents ranging from middle-aged women to bearded university students 
displayed a remarkable enthusiasm to join in the general East European surge 
toward greater freedom and representative democratic rights. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual day began with a particularly strong speech at the National 
Assembly session by Slavcho Trunski, a World War II resistance fighter who is a 
national hero in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Trunski attacked Zhivkov for building lavish personal homes at state expense 
and diverting revenues from the Lyudmila Zhivkova Foundation, named after 
Zhivkov's daughter, who died in 1981 under mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In the cruelest slap in this country where the pro-Nazi monarchy was overthrown 
to install communism, Trunski accused Zhivkov and his family of living more 
splendidly than the Bulgarian czars from the Koburg-Gotha dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"Our czar was a very modest man compared to Zhivkov," said Trunski, causing a 
rumble of laughter in the assembly hall, although most of the delegates had 
served Zhivkov faithfully for years. 
</P>
<P>
Trunski called for an investigation into the Lyudmila Zhivkova Foundation and 
into the allegedly huge gambling debts of Zhivkov's son, Vladimir, director of 
the largely foreign-funded foundation. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report at the U.S. Embassy here, outside members of the Lyudmila 
Zhivkova council include Armand Hammer of Los Angeles and British publishing 
magnate Robert Maxwell. In the past, the embassy has coordinated several 
cultural activities through the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
At the demonstration following the National Assembly meeting, many in the crowd 
picked up on the corruption theme. 
</P>
<P>
"Give us the son of Zhivkov!" some of the demonstrators shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with millionaires and Mercedes!" chanted others. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, 53, a jowly man with thinning black hair, gave a speech before the 
National Assembly stressing the independence of the state, represented by the 
legislature, from the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of his words was somewhat diluted by his election Friday by 
the assembly to the title of chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of 
state), in addition to his position as general secretary of the Bulgarian 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
After the assembly's morning session, Mladenov was asked by American and French 
reporters if he thinks free elections like those in Poland are possible in 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible," he said. "Personally, I am for free elections." 
</P>
<P>
However, one of his associates, Parliament secretary Vladimir Kalaidjiev, 
doubted that Bulgaria, where legislatures are now elected on a single 
Fatherland Front slate, is ready for Western-style democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The creation of new parties is one of the necessities in our country," 
Kalaidjiev said. "But in the near future, I do not see the participation of new 
parties, although we are attracted to the principle. I don't think we are 
mature enough yet." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the National Assembly session, the first to be 
televised live in the history of this country of 9 million people, was the 
repeal of a notorious law that had been used to jail political prisoners during 
the Zhivkov regime.

BRAZILIAN LEFTIST CLINGS TO SLIM LEAD IN PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT

<P>
As returns trickled in Friday from the first round of Brazilian presidential 
elections, Luis Inacio da Silva of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party held a 
dwindling advantage in the race for second place and for a position on the 
runoff ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Leonel Brizola of the left-leaning Democratic Labor Party was close behind Da 
Silva, known as Lula, in the official computations. One or the other will face 
Fernando Collor de Mello and his centrist National Reconstruction Party in the 
Dec. 17 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, last held direct presidential 
elections in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Collor had 28.3% of the votes Friday evening, when about half the ballots had 
been tabulated by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Lula had 16.1% and Brizola 
14.4%, and 18 others shared the rest. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Globo TV network said Brizola had a narrow and diminishing lead 
over Lula in the network's unofficial computation of about four-fifths of all 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
Lula predicted Friday evening that late returns from remote areas in the 
impoverished north and northeast would finally put him ahead of Brizola. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be absolutely certain that we will go to the second round of 
these elections," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Brizola also predicted victory after protesting the slow pace of official 
computations. He called the electoral system "ineffective and disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
"Our country is being put in a ridiculous position," Brizola said. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that despite bitter clashes between him and Lula during the 
campaign, their parties should join forces for the runoff against Collor. He 
called Collor a "cub of the dictatorship," referring to Brazil's military 
government from 1964 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Collor, 40, got his start in politics with the conservative political party 
that supported the regime, but he now calls himself a centrist reformer. 
Officials in Collor's new party say they will seek center-left alliances for 
the runoff campaign, rejecting the rightist label that his leftist opponents 
give him. 
</P>
<P>
Lula, 44, has indicated that if he makes the runoff, he will try to polarize 
the campaign between right and left. It will be a dispute "of pennies against 
millions, of poor against rich," he has said. 
</P>
<P>
A former machinist and automotive union leader, Lula calls himself a socialist. 
Some major factions of his labor-based Workers' Party are staunchly Marxist, 
and the party has an election alliance with a small Communist splinter party. 
</P>
<P>
Brizola, 67, has called himself a socialist in the past but now says he is a 
moderate Social Democrat. He was governor of Rio de Janeiro state until 1987.

90 FEARED DEAD IN YUGOSLAVIA MINE BLAST

A gas explosion and fire in a coal mine Friday trapped workers nearly half a 
mile underground, and about 90 miners were feared dead, the Tanjug news agency 
reported. It said 73 miners had escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
A methane gas explosion and fire erupted at noon at the Aleksinacki Rudnici 
mine, 120 miles south of Belgrade, as equipment was being welded in a shaft 
about 2,300 feet underground, mine director Branislav Mandusic told Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
The state news agency quoted him as saying flames blocked the mine's main 
access shaft, and it was believed the miners perished because of poisonous 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
White smoke rising from the mine late Friday was visible a mile away, and 
police kept relatives and reporters well away from the pit, which is one mile 
outside the town of Aleksinac. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams, including special units from other mines in the region, were 
trying to extinguish the fire and reach the site of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Mandusic said all of the miners were equipped with oxygen tanks but that "in 
the exceptionally grave circumstances, these could not be used." He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Mandusic said 73 miners left the pit safely, but they worked in a different 
part of the mine. Earlier reports had said 104 miners were trapped. 
</P>
<P>
A methane explosion at the same mine in 1983 killed 38 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of people, including relatives of the missing miners, gathered in 
freezing temperatures to await news of the missing miners. Several survivors 
agreed there was little hope for their trapped colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire is still burning, and the temperatures were too high for us to get 
all the way through," said Zivorad Stojisavljevic, a member of the rescue team.

ETHICS PANEL VOTES FOR REVIEW OF CHARGES AGAINST 5 SENATORS; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN S&amp;L: CRANSTON IS AMONG THOSE ACCUSED OF IMPROPERLY INTERVENING WITH 
FEDERAL REGULATORS. AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL IS HIRED TO STUDY ALLEGATIONS.

The Senate Ethics Committee voted unanimously Friday to have an outside counsel 
review influence-peddling allegations against Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
four other senators in connection with the $2-billion failure of Lincoln 
Savings and Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted also to have the special counsel investigate similar 
complaints against Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) resulting from scandal at 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Bennett, a Washington attorney who has specialized in white-collar 
crime, was hired to help the committee determine whether it should proceed with 
a preliminary inquiry, the first of three stages of investigation the panel 
could pursue. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), John 
Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) are accused of improperly 
intervening with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln after receiving 
political contributions from its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato is accused of using improper influence in federal housing programs on 
behalf of political contributors and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of the House Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee 
said that the panel has been informed that Keating plans to invoke the 5th 
Amendment right against self-incrimination when he is called to testify Tuesday 
about Lincoln's collapse and his dealings with the five senators. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) said that fellow members of the committee had 
been told of Keating's intentions, but a spokesman for the Arizona businessman 
said he did not believe a final decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley J. Boland, a spokesman for Lincoln's parent company, American 
Continental Corp., said that Keating had been urged by a number of advisers to 
decline to testify. He said that American Continental executives believe that 
the House hearing does not provide a fair forum. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, under FBI investigation on fraud and other allegations, has said in 
court documents that he expects to be indicted for his role in the Lincoln 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said that he did not think the Ethics Committee needed to hire an 
outside counsel because "as numerous legal precedents have shown, I did not 
violate any laws, ethical standards or rules of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the appointment of Bennett, brother of William J. Bennett, the 
top official in the Administration's war on drugs, "will further promote 
confidence in the Senate's process for reviewing the conduct of its members." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and his colleagues have been accused by Common Cause, a political 
action lobby, of improperly helping Keating with federal regulators in 1987. 
Keating and his associates had contributed about $1.3 million to campaigns and 
other causes supported by the senators. 
</P>
<P>
McCain said in a statement: "I am confident that an investigation will 
vindicate my repeated statements that I never abused my office nor took actions 
that were improper." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said: "I welcome anything that will establish the facts and I will 
cooperate fully." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned that DeConcini not only discussed Lincoln with 
federal regulators, he also telephoned the boss of California's top savings and 
loan regulator on behalf of Keating in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Keating was trying to sell the Irvine firm before federal agents 
could seize it. William J. Crawford, California's savings and loan 
commissioner, had rejected the proposed deal, and Keating was seeking federal 
approval instead. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Crawford said that DeConcini sought assurances from his 
boss, John K. Geoghegan, that Crawford would keep his objections to the sale 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that Geoghegan, a member of Gov. George Deukmejian's cabinet, did 
not try to silence him and that he continued to oppose the transaction. The 
deal was rejected by federal regulators, too, and Lincoln was seized by the 
government last April 14. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost the federal government an estimated $2 billion to bail out 
Lincoln, making it the most expensive thrift failure ever. 
</P>

James S. Granelli in Orange County contributed to this story.

Police arrested more than 700 anti-abortion protesters Friday on charges of 
violating a new District of Columbia law barring demonstrators from gathering 
within 100 feet of abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Operation Rescue, the national anti-abortion group that organized 
the demonstrations, said that more than 1,000 protesters came here from around 
the country to oppose the new city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Outside a downtown Washington clinic where abortions are performed, police 
arrested some of the approximately 300 protesters who were blocking the 
clinic's entrance and congregating on the sidewalk outside. 
</P>
<P>
The protests, which began before dawn, took place at four clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested will face misdemeanor charges of blocking an entrance, which 
carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $50 fine, or crossing a 
police line, which carries a $50 fine, police Sgt. Joe Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
While they blocked the entrance to the clinic, the protesters sang hymns from 
the civil rights movement and used bullhorns to spread their message. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 abortion-rights demonstrators attempted to shout down the 
anti-abortion forces from across the street.

BILL WOULD WRITE ROE DECISION INTO LAW

Abortion-rights supporters in Congress, setting the stage for a political fight 
next year, announced their intention Friday to push a bill that would write 
into law the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The bill they introduced would, in effect, overcome the Supreme Court's 
decision last summer in the so-called Webster case that gave states greater 
authority to impose restrictions on abortions, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, just a few lines long, would forbid states to restrict a woman's 
right to have an abortion before the time that her fetus becomes viable, or at 
any time when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said their aim was to take the fight over rights to abortions away 
from state legislatures, allowing them to impose only those restrictions that 
are medically necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Although no action was expected until next year, abortion rights backers said 
that the bill would become the central focus of future congressional and 
political debate on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
A result, they said, would be to thrust the abortion issue even further into 
the politics of the 1990 House and Senate races. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is the moral equivalent for women of the 1964 Civil Rights Act," 
Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the abortion opponents, Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N. J.), said 
he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full debate on abortion. He said 
he was confident that the House would defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill had 88 sponsors, and a version introduced in the Senate carried 
19 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision 
establishing a woman's right to an abortion and at reversing the Webster case. 
Abortion-rights supporters contend that the Webster decision eroded rights 
established 16 years earlier and that it signaled a possible further erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights supporters in the Senate on Thursday ended their efforts to 
overcome President Bush's veto of a bill that would extend Medicaid abortions 
to women who are victims of rape or incest. The House and Senate agreed to 
provisions keeping the current prohibition on federal payment for abortions 
except in cases when the life of the mother is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides were also watching to see whether Bush would sign or veto a spending 
bill for the District of Columbia. He vetoed an earlier version because it 
permitted federal financing of abortions in cases of rape, incest or danger to 
the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed a new version that prohibits use of federal funds except to 
save the mother's life but permits the city to use its own funds for other 
abortions.

PENNSYLVANIA OKS RESTRICTIVE BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Robert P. Casey on Friday signed a bill giving Pennsylvania the most 
restrictive abortion law in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The action makes Pennsylvania the first state to take advantage of a U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling in July that gave states more leeway in making their own 
abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he believes that the bill, which takes effect in 60 days, is 
constitutional and will not provide a test case to challenge the Supreme 
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which gave women the constitutional right to 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The state House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 143 to 58; the 
Senate approved it 33 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
The law bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except to save the 
life of the mother or prevent "substantial and irreversible" harm; prohibits 
abortions based on the fetus' sex; requires women to inform their husbands if 
they plan to get an abortion; regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted 
fetuses and mandates that women wait 24 hours to get an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Also under the law, doctors will have to inform women about the procedure 
before performing an abortion and tell them the likely age of the fetus, as 
well as explain risks and alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The law carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the regulations. A 
conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week provision could mean up to 
seven years in prison and $15,000 in fines.

A teen-age suspect in the gang rape last spring of a jogger in Central Park 
said that police officers brought him back to the crime scene and tried to 
force him to smear himself with the woman's blood. In a pretrial hearing on the 
admissibility of confessions at the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Kharey 
Wise, 17, also testified that a detective, in order to force him to confess, 
slapped him so hard he temporarily lost the hearing in his right ear. Wise said 
that police officers brought him to the crime scene two days after the April 19 
attack. Wise and five other youths were indicted for rape and attempted murder. 
In a videotaped confession, Wise admitted holding the jogger while others raped 
her.

TRADITION: SUBURBANITES FACE INVASIONS BY DEER HOUNDS AND THEIR ARMED OWNERS. 
LEGISLATORS REFUSE TO CURB HALLOWED CUSTOM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Barks and yelps cut through the still autumn air as the hounds crash through 
the woods in furious pursuit of a deer. Following close behind is the hunter, 
high-powered rifle at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the deer, frantically seeking an escape route, and the dogs, 
invigorated by the chase, burst out of the woods, into a clearing -- and onto 
the property of an angry, frightened homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
On hearing the sharp crack of the rifle, the startled homeowner always has one 
hope -- that a horse, cow or family member is not the accidental target. 
</P>
<P>
This scene is played out countless times here and in neighboring states as the 
leaves turn and the dew gives way to frost. It is hunting time in the South. 
</P>
<P>
In Mississippi and other Southern states, dogs have been used for decades to 
flush out deer. But now the traditional practice is literally running right 
over new suburban developments. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sat on the porch and watched them chase deer onto my property," said Don 
McNair, an insurance salesman who lives on the outskirts of Meridian. "There's 
not much you can do. You can't go and talk to the dog." He said he hesitates to 
confront the deer-dog hunters because he is "afraid they'll burn my house 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Mattox, a retired telephone company worker who has lived in DeKalb for 20 
years, bitterly gestured around his tree-lined lot. "I can't even have my 
grandchildren out here on Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's too dangerous. It's 
getting worse every year." 
</P>
<P>
Deer-dog hunting is already under way in Georgia and begins today in Alabama 
and Mississippi. In this state, a second season also starts on Christmas Eve, 
with a separate season in between for hunters without dogs, the so-called 
"still" hunters. 
</P>
<P>
The passion that surrounds the debate over deer-dog hunting seems limitless. It 
includes numerous tales of gun-to-gun confrontations, charges of arson, 
physical attacks, maimed livestock and sideswiped vehicles and has resulted in 
heated legislative fights over whether the sport should be banned or curbed. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is in many ways a clash of an old tradition and a new reality that 
includes shrinking public hunting space, increased residential development of 
wooded areas and a fledgling belief that hunting is not sacrosanct. And, 
although property owners say the dispute simply centers on the violation of 
their property rights, supporters of deer-dog hunters portray it as a case of 
new, landed gentry trying to oppress common folks upholding an old Southern 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog hunter in the state of Mississippi is the less affluent," said state 
Rep. Dick Livingston, a deer-dog hunter who is chairman of the House Game and 
Fish Committee. "They are the factory workers and the carpenters and the 
bricklayers. They probably wouldn't be as educated" as the still hunters, who 
are "the bank executives, the insurance executives, the lawyer, the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said: "It's in a sense the little guy versus the big guy." 
</P>
<P>
For years, property owners have complained about encroaching hunters and, last 
year, John Stack III, a business professor at the Meridian branch of 
Mississippi State University, started an organization called the Mississippi 
Property Rights Assn., which mounted a nonstop lobbying and educational effort 
to change laws and minds on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his efforts, hunters throughout the South find themselves 
increasingly on the defensive, although experts say their numbers are so large 
and include so many powerful public officials that a total ban on deer-dog 
hunting is virtually impossible. About 250,000 people hunt deer in Mississippi, 
200,000 in Alabama and 284,000 in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Stack, an energetic man who can talk for hours about deer dogs, is a hunter 
himself, but he, like many others, makes distinctions between hunters who hunt 
in designated areas and the "outlaws" who trespass and endanger lives and 
property. 
</P>
<P>
While driving his van over the red-dirt back roads of Lauderdale County here in 
eastern Mississippi, Stack contended that many deer-dog hunters not only 
trespass but also further violate the law by firing weapons across roads -- a 
despised practice known as "road hunting." 
</P>
<P>
"They're a public nuisance," Stack said, "like cigarette smoke or noise or 
odors or anything else." The hunt is so intoxicating, Stack said, that "they go 
into a trance when they see a deer. They get 'buck fever.' All they see is 
deer, nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Stack is a bit more charitable toward the deer dogs, usually hounds but often 
strays or dogs adopted from the pound. He does not blame the animals for 
ignoring "No Hunting" signs and running onto people's property. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogs can't read," Stack said. "That's one of the biggest education problems in 
Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the dogs lead two lives: On the one hand, they are loved 
for their talent and pampered for the hunt. ("A guy might not care if you shoot 
his wife," said Stack, only half jokingly, "but don't mess with his deer dog.") 
But often, say the experts, the animals are abandoned if they are caught on 
someone's property. "Ain't my dog," goes the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
Deer-dog club houses dot the woods in rural areas. At one in Moscow, Miss., a 
small gray frame building with a barbecue grill outside and long picnic tables 
and a television set inside, a dozen hounds behind a fence howled greetings at 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Rawson of the Mississippi Hunting Dog Assn. complained that "we've been 
portrayed as bloodthirsty," but "I get more pleasure out of having my dogs run 
than I do pulling the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
Rawson, who at 36 has been hunting for 25 years, said he "wouldn't do anything 
intentionally to be on anybody's property that doesn't want me to be on it. 
Neither would I intentionally do anything that would allow my dogs to get on 
somebody else's property." However, he added, there is "no way" anyone can 
exert complete control over dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Rawson, there are "a lot more problems with domestic house dogs" 
destroying livestock than there are with deer dogs. Similarly, he said, very 
few deer-dog hunters violate the law, and very few property owners complain. 
"Peaceful coexistence," he said, should be the goal of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. Property owners tell myriad stories of invading deer dogs and of 
intimidation by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Strebeck, a genealogist in Decatur who carries a clipboard to record 
license plates and document abuses, said her mailbox has been bashed and 
livestock killed, and drunk hunters have staggered onto the road in front of 
her car. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when she confronted trespassers, she said, she was asked: "Ms. Strebeck, 
how would you like to have your place burned down?" 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials in several states said they face great difficulty in 
making cases against violators. The general procedure is for property owners to 
alert the local sheriff that violations are taking place. 
</P>
<P>
But, usually by the time officials arrive on the scene, hunters listening to 
police radios have alerted one another and stopped the activity or left the 
scene. "They are tough to catch," said Gib Johnston, a spokesman for the 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which has 250 law enforcement officers 
to patrol hunting areas. "There are so few of us and so many of them." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Alabama, which has 130 officers under its Game and Fish Division, 
Keith Guyse, assistant chief of the wildlife section, said the mobility and 
technology of outlaw hunters make the laws "difficult to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
And, here in Mississippi, Dan Tullos, chief of enforcement for the Department 
of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, which has 200 officers in the field, said "we 
could clean up" the problems with stronger hunting laws. 
</P>
<P>
But stronger laws seem unlikely. Stack has drawn up legislation that would 
restrict dog-hunting to hunting sites with at least 1,000 acres, an idea that 
Livingston said will never make it through his committee because all of his 
colleagues oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, said Livingston, placing restrictions on deer hunting would have a 
"devastating effect" on Mississippi's economy, which derives $500 million from 
hunting of all kinds. "Spinoff" businesses that depend on hunters, such as 
sporting goods stores, dog food producers and gasoline stations, would suffer 
huge losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the frightened landowners say the price they pay in fear each year is far 
greater than any such losses. 
</P>
<P>
Stack is threatening a class-action suit to stop deer-dog hunting and has 
mounted a spirited letter-writing campaign to lawmakers and newspapers around 
the state. Nevertheless, his allies seem resigned to defeat, for now, citing 
tragedy in the woods as their best hope for bringing change. 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch in downtown Meridian, Gloria Smith Moran of Harrison County, down on 
Mississippi's Gulf Coast, said matter of factly: "There'll have to be a death 
before something is done. And I don't want to be it." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Jackson of Wiggins, Miss., who also was at the lunch, agreed, adding, 
"People living in rural Mississippi need combat training." Then, after thinking 
a moment, he said: "Matter of fact, I'd prefer to be in a combat situation 
where I knew they were going to fire at me and I could fire back."

BUSH SIGNS BILL HIKING BASE WAGE TO $4.25

President Bush on Friday signed a bill that will raise the minimum wage to 
$4.25 an hour from $3.35 by the spring of 1991, formally accepting the 
compromise that ended a year of disagreement with congressional Democrats and 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Bush praised the measure, which he said would "protect jobs and put more money 
into the pockets of our workers." But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said it 
merely marked progress "to the 50-yard line" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to $4.25 an hour by 
April, 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80 on April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The new law includes a lower "training wage" for new workers who are 
teen-agers, a provision sought by Bush but initially opposed by congressional 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Bush in June vetoed a bill that would have increased the wage to $4.55 over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
At an Oval Office signing ceremony attended by congressional leaders and 
sponsors, Bush called the new act "a good example of what we can do in the 
future on other matters." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, told 
reporters: "It's not as much as the working poor deserve, but it was a real 
compromise and it brought the President's position to one of not saying take it 
or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said a Democratic-led effort to raise the wage further in 1992, a 
presidential election year, was "a live option." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the new law, young people 16 to 19 years old who have never 
worked could be paid the training wage for 90 days. Employers with a training 
plan in place could pay the young workers a training rate for 90 days more. 
</P>
<P>
The training wage would be $3.35 an hour after next April 1. When the minimum 
wage increases to $4.25 a year later, the subminimum would increase to $3.61 an 
hour. The provision allowing for the subminimum expires in April, 1993, unless 
extended by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Among others at the signing ceremony were Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)

HOUSE PANEL TO HOLD HEARINGS ON IOWA BLAST

The House Armed Services Committee announced Friday that it will hold hearings 
next month on the Navy's inquiry and subsequent finding that a troubled sailor 
apparently caused the fatal explosion aboard the battleship Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"We have unearthed significant new evidence that casts new light on the Navy's 
conclusion that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig committed suicide and mass murder 
in the gun turret," said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the 
Armed Services subcommittee on investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Mavroules said his panel has been reviewing "several aspects of the Navy 
investigation -- especially its technical competence and its psychological 
analysis." 
</P>
<P>
Mavroules refused to provide specifics but expressed concern about a "question 
of interpretation" of the evidence. The congressman cited an FBI report that 
said its laboratory investigation on the incident was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"I want documentation," Mavroules said in an interview. "Unless the Navy does 
that, it's a discredit to the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The House hearings, scheduled for Dec. 12 and 13, will include witnesses from 
the Navy and FBI, Mavroules said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials on Thursday had defended their conclusion that the April 19 
blast in gun turret No. 2 was "most likely" caused by Hartwig, who died along 
with 46 shipmates in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the Navy's technical and criminal 
investigation into the blast, testified Thursday that additional tests 
conducted since his report Sept. 7 found "unique foreign material" on the 
projectile from the exploding gun barrel. 
</P>
<P>
He said the material was iron wires coated with calcium, chlorine and oxygen, 
which would be produced by "some types of non-electronic explosive devices."

SEX HARASSMENT CASE CALLED A FIRST; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: AN ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN IS AWARDED $30,000 IN DAMAGES FROM THE 
ACCOUNTING FIRM SHE WORKED FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In what was described as the first employee sexual harassment case won by an 
Asian-American woman under state civil rights laws, an administrative judge has 
ordered a Pasadena accounting firm to pay $30,000 in damages to its former 
receptionist, state officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Fair Employment and Housing Commission also recognized that 
cultural beliefs held by the employee, Denise Okamoto, kept her from speaking 
out for six years about a boss who, on several occasions, fondled her feet 
while she answered telephone calls and engaged in acts of harassment "virtually 
on a daily basis," according to the commission report and a state lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Tuckley, a partner in the accounting firm of Guill, Bankenbaker &amp; 
Lawson and the focus of the complaint, denies engaging in any harassment and 
said he believed that the seriousness of the matter had been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Owyang, legal affairs secretary of the commission, described the Okamoto 
case as a first but attributed that partly to the fact that "the vast majority 
of filings never make it to hearing." 
</P>
<P>
At a downtown news conference, Okamoto, 28, said the harassment began in 1980 
while she was a receptionist at the accountant firm. When Tuckley, 60, began 
telling sexual jokes to Okamoto, who was then 18, she was advised by her mother 
-- also an employee at the firm -- to shrug them off, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Midori Okamoto -- an 18-year employee of the company whose duties 
included supervising her daughter -- told the younger Okamoto that complaints 
about Tuckley might jeopardize their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
During a commission hearing, Denise Okamoto told Administrative Judge Rosalyn 
Chapman that as sexual overtures from Tuckley intensified, he revealed that he 
had a "foot fetish." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1982, he entered her small, isolated cubicle on several occasions 
and "got down on his hands and knees to kiss and stroke my feet while I talked 
with clients on the phone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Osumi, legal counsel at the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, 
cited 14 other types of harassment that occurred over Okamoto's six years with 
the firm. He said the complaint filed by the department with the commission 
included accounts of harassment on more than 200 occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother said I should try to not pay attention to it," Okamoto said Friday. 
"She told me just to laugh. She said that's the (Asian) way to deal with 
hardships." 
</P>
<P>
The mother and daughter relationship became strained as the harassment 
intensified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other employees testified at the hearing that the incidents took place, but 
there were differing views on Tuckley's intent. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto said she and her mother repeatedly asked Tuckley to refrain, but when 
he persisted, the daughter was advised by her mother to gaman, the Japanese 
word for endure. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I wanted to quit," Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuckley said in a phone interview Friday that Midori Okamoto has filed a civil 
suit against his firm for wrongful discharge. She left the company in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"All this came about because the mother took an extended vacation during the 
busy season," Tuckley said. "That year we didn't give her a raise. She quit. 
Three months later the daughter quit. Then all of a sudden, we get these 
charges of sexual harassment. The way I see it, the mother talked the daughter 
into doing this." 
</P>
<P>
In the commission hearing, Tuckley acknowledged that he had engaged in some of 
the disputed behavior -- telling sexual jokes, showing stag films at a company 
retreat and brushing up against the former receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the accounts given by Okamoto and witnesses were taken out of 
context. He admitted to making comments that were sexual in nature to Denise 
Okamoto but said he meant them to be humorous. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Okamoto said she has learned during the complaint filing that sexual 
harassment can be perceived differently by the person committing the offense 
and the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"It does something to you psychologically," she said. "People tried to tell me, 
'It's, like, all in your mind.' That's just not the case sometimes."

REGENTS REVIEW POTENTIAL UNIVERSITY SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The University of California Board of Regents met behind closed doors Friday to 
discuss 136 possible sites throughout the state for three new campuses the 
university says it needs to accommodate more students. 
</P>
<P>
The regents refused, however, to identify which properties are under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
UC President David P. Gardner and the regents said they feared the price of 
some of the lands would rise if the discussions were open. Gardner said, 
however, many of the sites are being offered to the university as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, UC officials had planned to release a list of 50 properties Friday 
of between 160 and 1,400 acres that are close enough to transportation and 
population centers to make viable university settings. Officials had hoped to 
narrow the choices down by the end of next year in order to build the first of 
the new schools by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said the number of available sites surprised them. So instead, 
Gardner and his staff decided to divide the state into three regions -- north, 
central and south -- and focus initially on which area should be the first to 
get a new UC campus. That regional decision is expected by early next year, and 
two or three of the most promising sites within the area will be selected by 
later in the year, with environmental impact studies to follow. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the regents' meeting, Gardner stressed that each of 
the three regions needs a new campus by 2005. However, his claim is likely to 
face close scrutiny in the Legislature because of the enormous construction 
costs -- estimated to be at least $900 million for three schools. 
</P>
<P>
According to a map distributed Friday, the central region designated by the UC 
planners contains none of the existing nine UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
But Gardner warned boosters of a campus in the Central Valley not to assume a 
site there will be chosen first. Much will depend on ongoing studies about an 
area's college attendance rates and the eligibility of its students for UC 
admissions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of communities throughout the state have lobbied the regents to locate a 
campus in their areas because of the economic benefits one can bring. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials anticipate student enrollment will grow by 62,000 to 205,000 in 
the next 15 years. But some other education experts have said such growth could 
be handled by expanding existing campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the regents unanimously voted Friday to hike next year's 
education and registration fees by 4.7% for California residents and 2.5% for 
out-of-state students. Excluding housing, food and books, a UC education will 
cost residents $1,703 and non-Californians $7,619 if the Legislature and 
governor agree with the proposal.

Fresno has been ordered to limit the charge for copies of traffic accident 
reports to the actual cost of duplication instead of the $25 fee adopted two 
years ago. The Superior Court decision is the result of a suit filed by the 
California State Automobile Assn., which regularly must obtain copies of 
accident reports to process claims for its insurance customers.

In what he believed is the largest such seizure in the world, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp staged a press conference Friday surrounded by more than 
1,000 pounds of the drug methamphetamine and $1 million in $100 bills. Four men 
arrested on a variety of drug charges in connection with the seizure are headed 
for federal court trials that could cost them as much as 40 years in prison, 
Van de Kamp said, with the "mastermind" possibly facing a life term.

ANTONIO VELLANI, 62; AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE DIRECTOR EMERITUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antonio (Toni) Vellani, director emeritus of the American Film Institute's 
Center for Advanced Film and Television Studies, has died of heart failure. He 
was 62. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian-born Vellani died Monday at UCLA Medical Center, AFI spokesman Joe 
Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Vellani joined the AFI in 1968 and led the Center for Advanced Film and 
Television Studies for nine years. He resigned as filmmaker-in-residence in 
June because of health problems, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
After studying law in Bologna, his birthplace, he came to the United States and 
studied film at USC. He headed documentary film production for the U.S. 
Information Agency before joining AFI. 
</P>
<P>
Vellani's professional career included the role of associate producer on George 
Stevens Sr.'s five-year project "The Greatest Story Ever Told," a 1965 epic. 
</P>
<P>
He worked in creative and executive capacities on more than 100 documentary and 
dramatic films, including "Robert Kennedy Remembered," "Valley Forge" and 
"George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey," George Stevens Jr.'s tribute to his 
late father. 
</P>
<P>
Vellani's survivors include his wife, Sonia, and a daughter.

SUIT FILED TO BLOCK WESTLAKE-HARVARD MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of mothers opposing the merger of their daughters' exclusive Westlake 
School with the equally prestigious Harvard School, filed a lawsuit Friday in 
an effort to block the union that would create a new coed institution. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the four "Westlake Mothers" are seeking a temporary restraining 
order to prevent a final vote on the controversial merger set for Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in Santa Monica Superior Court but was transferred 
downtown late Friday when a judge disqualified himself after being informed 
that a judicial colleague in Santa Monica has daughters at Westlake and 
actively opposes the merger. A hearing is set for Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action is based in part on a claim that it is a breach of charitable 
trust to change the school from girls only, non-sectarian to a coed school 
under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only would Westlake's assets come under immediate, direct control of the 
Episcopal Church, but the assets could be irretrievably subject to eventual 
distribution to a 'religious' institution," wrote the mothers' attorney, Karen 
Kaplowitz, in her request for court intercession. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Westlake board contend it is acting in good faith and that 
the parents have no legal standing to interfere with the proposed merger. Karl 
Samuelian, one of the board's attorneys, said the only purpose he can see in 
the lawsuit is to "cause anxiety, confuse and harass the Board of Trustees . . 
. to try to influence their vote." 
</P>
<P>
The "Westlake Mothers" are four members of a large contingent of parents 
involved in an acrimonious battle to stop the proposed merger announced without 
warning in October. They view the merger as an acquisition of the prestigious 
Holmby Hills girls junior and senior high school by its equally prestigious 
male counterpart in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their preference for girls-only education, parents are opposed 
to turning over a $50-million piece of property to Harvard, which will have a 
2-1 majority on the board of the new school, Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplowitz wants a hearing on the rationale for the merger, which board members 
said was based on a "window of opportunity" to join Harvard before it went coed 
on its own. In their opinion, a coed Harvard would siphon off some of 
Westlake's top students, leading to financial peril. 
</P>
<P>
The board's attorneys are asking that all 230 Los Angeles county Superior Court 
judges be disqualified because of Superior Court Judge Robert Altman's 
outspoken opposition to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Superior Court Presiding Judge Ricardo Torres will take up the matter 
Monday.

A Beijing museum official has been sentenced to life imprisonment for stealing 
imperial relics and then destroying some of them to avoid detection, the 
Beijing Evening News said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Liu Junqi, 33, stole a cup, clothes, diamonds and a hat, 
worth a total of $7,600 dollars, from the Capital Museum between April, 1987, 
and September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He sold part of his booty for $1,080 and used the proceeds to buy sofas and 
carpets. When the losses were discovered, he destroyed or threw away the rest 
of his plunder in a bid to escape capture, the paper said.

SALVADORANS IN ORANGE COUNTY ENGAGED IN OWN STRUGGLE OVER HELPLESSNESS

When Fernando Jacob, a recent emigre from El Salvador, walked into a popular 
Salvadoran restaurant and meeting place Friday afternoon, he wanted a lot more 
than lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Santa Ana resident was looking for fellow countrymen to talk 
about the violence in their war-torn country and to curse the hundreds of miles 
between them and loved ones back home. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream, now more than ever, is to have my family here with me," said Jacob, 
whose wife and three children live just outside the battlegrounds of San 
Salvador in Sonsonate. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, Jacob and other Salvadorans from Orange County 
crowded around tables at El Carbonero restaurant and talked about how troubled 
they are by bloody events in their country. All said they are fighting feelings 
of helplessness and loneliness as family and friends struggle with the renewed 
fighting in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I call my wife every day," said Jacob, who left El Salvador three years ago 
after rebel forces demanded the crops of a farm where he was an accountant. 
After he gave in to the rebels' demands, the government's military threatened 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
The recent offensive by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the 
killing of six Jesuit priests Thursday only confirmed his belief that "neither 
side is fighting a just cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, Jacob said, he is worried about his wife, whose life 
recently was threatened by government troops. "What can I do? I feel alone, 
very alone." 
</P>
<P>
Others at the table shared his feelings, saying they could not reach relatives 
back home because of jammed phone lines and a mail service shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
Antonieta Chinchilla, who has lived in the United States 14 months, said she 
has a plane ticket to go to El Salvador on Monday to visit her mother and 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go now," the 29-year-old Santa Ana resident said. Over a plate of 
pupusas, she added, "If the rebels take over, I will never go back. . . . This 
violence is not logical." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those interviewed Friday said they cared more about a peaceful 
resolution to the conflict in their country than about the politics of the 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't support either side," said Jose Sanchez, who lives in Los Angeles and 
works in Santa Ana. "They both persecute people." Then he smiled and said that 
someday, when all the fighting is over, he will return to El Salvador. "It is 
my homeland," he said. "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Several said they fear the slaying of the religious leaders means that a 
resolution is nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob said Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the Central American University 
who was shot to death Thursday, was a "very brilliant man and a great loss to 
the country." Because of his murder the violence may "go on for a long time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the Santa Ana restaurant on Main Street, at the El Salvador Imports 
shop, manager Flor Sandoval, 32, said the news from the country has "gripped 
everyone in the community." It is all her customers have talked about lately, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at El Cairo Express, a mailing service that specializes in 
sending letters to El Salvador, secretary Miriam Aquino said: "Business is real 
slow. . . . People know that the mail is not being delivered and is sitting at 
the airport. . . . This is a real sad time for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Edwards, executive director of the American Immigrant Foundation, said 
her office has been flooded with calls and visits from worried Salvadorans. 
"Most of them just want to know what is happening back home and how their 
families are doing," said Edwards, who acted as interpreter at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
She said the conflict has a bittersweet side effect for many Salvadorans who 
are living illegally in the United States. "With the violence going on, it will 
be harder to deport them," she said, adding that it might even make it easier 
for them to get political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that it takes something like this in their country to make it a 
little better for them here," she said.

JUDGE REJECTS LAST-MINUTE BID TO HALT BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE FATHER OF A HUNTINGTON BEACH HIGH FOOTBALL PLAYER FILED A FEDERAL 
LAWSUIT IN A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO STOP A PLAYOFF GAME AND REINSTATE HIS SON'S 
TEAM.

<P>
Two and a half hours before kickoff, the father of a Huntington Beach High 
School football player filed a federal lawsuit in a last-ditch effort to stop 
Friday's playoff game between Fontana and Fountain Valley high schools. A 
federal judge, however, refused to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
With only 20 seconds to spare before the courthouse closed, Donald Ruskin, his 
wife and their two lawyers arrived at the building, leaped out of their car and 
ran inside just as marshals were preparing to lock the doors. 
</P>
<P>
The 5 p.m. filing took place precisely 23 hours after a three-judge panel of 
the 4th District Court of Appeal took Huntington Beach out of the playoffs, 
reversing a lower court order that had reinstated the team. The appeals panel 
found that the California Interscholastic Federation had the right to bar the 
team from competition for using an ineligible player, starting tackle David 
Roman, 17. 
</P>
<P>
Ruskin's lawsuit contends that the CIF violated the constitutional rights of 
his son, defensive tackle Walter Ruskin, 17, by improperly depriving him of a 
shot at the playoffs. He wanted a temporary restraining order halting the game 
in which Fountain Valley played in place of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, who took the unusual step of hearing 
the case after hours, rejected the bid. He said the questions of whether CIF 
rules are fair and whether they are fairly applied are not constitutional 
issues, so they should not be heard in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing the impact he would have if he had granted the order, Letts said, "It 
looks like the choices are to forfeit the game and watch the riot or play it 
and then not count it." 
</P>
<P>
Watching the courtroom clock ticking to 6 p.m., CIF attorney Andrew Patterson 
noted that there was "a real question" of whether the CIF could actually stop 
the game between Fountain Valley and Fontana at that hour. Fontana won the 
game, 51-6. 
</P>
<P>
"The school buses have left," he said. "The field is open to the public. It is 
expected there will be a crowd of about 8,000 people there. One or more of the 
teams is probably practicing on the field right now." 
</P>
<P>
Letts told Ruskin's attorney, Margaret Thurn, that he would do more harm to 
more people by issuing the order and causing two teams to give up their game 
than by granting it and letting Huntington Beach back into the playoffs. Letts 
sympathized with the team's dilemma, but said that, legally, Thurn's case did 
not hold water. 
</P>
<P>
"As to those completely innocent people, which ones are going to be deprived of 
their right to play?" Letts said. "They're all innocent. Hard as it is with an 
administrative infraction of the rules to mess it up for everyone else, I just 
don't think you can get there from here." 
</P>
<P>
It was a bitter and final defeat for Ruskin, who said, "The children shouldn't 
be punished for the mistakes of adults." 
</P>
<P>
School officials did not realize that Roman was ineligible until last week, 
after regular-season play had ended and the 8-2 Oilers team was preparing for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
CIF officials, who spent many hours in court all week, greeted the last-minute 
lawsuit with an exhausted sigh and a bit of amazement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just surprised," said Dean Crowley, associate administrator of the CIF's 
Southern Section.

SOUTH COUNTY AIRPORT FOES ATTACK, CIRCULATE PETITIONS

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clutching a petition, Ilse Byrnes stepped hesitantly out of the bright 
afternoon sunshine into the cool darkness of the Swallows Inn, one of the 
city's more colorful watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
Not certain of her reception, Byrnes approached the knot of patrons huddled at 
the end of the well-worn bar. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, though, she was the center of attention, as locals flocked 
around her to put their names on the three-page petition opposing the use of a 
site in the mountainous countryside near their homes for a regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?" Barbara O'Donnell shouted to a friend over the sound of 
country music blaring from the jukebox. "They want to put an airport down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
"Just sign it," O'Donnell, who was quickly converted, coaxed Louis Grijalva as 
he sipped a long-neck beer. He did. 
</P>
<P>
The petition drive launched two weeks ago by the San Juan Capistrano City 
Council is part of an effort by community and business leaders and elected 
officials in South Orange County to block airport sites there as the time for a 
decision nears. 
</P>
<P>
A public meeting is scheduled for 8 a.m. today at the University Club on the UC 
Irvine campus by the ad hoc group that listed South County as one site for an 
air facility that would relieve overcrowding at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials in San Juan Capistrano, Mission Viejo, Dana Point and San 
Clemente have stepped up their attacks. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that an airport in the uninhabited regions of South County between 
San Clemente and the Cleveland National Forest would devastate the rural 
environment, where thousands of campers, hikers and horseback riders enjoy a 
break from growing urban development. 
</P>
<P>
They also complain that the proposed facility, which would bring 13 million 
airline passengers a year to the area, would create enormous traffic problems 
and spoil the relatively clean air. 
</P>
<P>
The Airport Site Coalition, a private organization that was formed with county 
and federal approval in 1985, will complete its controversial, 20-month study 
of possible airport sites by next month. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing 31 locations in and out of Orange County, the coalition has 
settled on four sites, two of them in Orange County, and both of those in South 
County, according to Clarence J. Turner, the group's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors will make the final decision based on 
the coalition's recommendations, Turner added. 
</P>
<P>
But South Orange County leaders say that before the board receives the 
coalition study, they will make certain that they send a loud and clear 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just totally inconceivable that anyone would think of putting an airport 
in one of the last undeveloped areas of Orange County," Dana Point City 
Councilman Mike Eggers said this week. "It is environmentally unfeasible." 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes, who has collected more than 1,500 hundred signatures in the San Juan 
Capistrano area, hopes to double that amount by the end of the month. After 
that, the petitions will go to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody I talk to wants to sign," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The four potential sites are: 
</P>
<P>
Potrero Los Pinos, a rural valley about 25 miles northeast of San Juan 
Capistrano on Ortega Highway; it is surrounded by campgrounds, a juvenile work 
camp and a nudist colony. It is part of the Cleveland National Forest and has 
been opposed by all mayors in South County and Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), 
</P>
<P>
Cristianitos Canyon, a hilly area that is less than two miles from San Clemente 
City Hall. The TRW Capistrano test site for space weapons is also in 
Cristianitos Canyon, and the proposed flight path would pass directly over the 
San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. 
</P>
<P>
South Camp Pendleton, in San Diego County, five miles north of Oceanside near 
Las Pulgas Road. That site has also been opposed by Packard and the U.S. Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
March Air Force Base in Riverside County, now an active Air Force installation 
that would include civilian use along with military under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Cristianitos Canyon was dropped from serious consideration in July but was 
placed back on the list last week when coalition members decided against 
considering Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
That action enraged officials of San Clemente, Dana Point, Mission Viejo and 
San Juan Capistrano, as well as some merchants, environmentalists and 
slow-growth leaders, who claim that the coalition reneged on a promise not to 
recommend a site what would be so close to San Clemente and the nuclear power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The time (for protesting the two South County sites) is now," said Michael 
Darnold, owner of the El Peon gift shop and co-chairman of the San Juan 
Capistrano Downtown Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said it is unlikely that any of the current top four sites will be 
dropped before the study is submitted to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"These sites make the most sense," Turner said in an interview from his Costa 
Mesa real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
"South County must realize that they are becoming a major section of the 
county," Turner said. "They play a major role and have the fastest expansion. 
They, too, are contributing to the problem. They should contribute to the 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
Turner further angered South County officials recently when he sent letters 
asking for contributions to the financially strapped organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Point, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano city councils refused to 
put the request to a vote, charging that the money spent so far -- $678,000 
from the Federal Aviation Adminstration and local private and public agencies 
-- has been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo council members agreed to consider the request at their Monday 
night meeting and rejected it by a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes, a San Juan Capistrano resident for the last 21 years, said it does not 
make sense to invest money in a new airport, which would take more than a 
decade to build, when either of the desert bases, which have been slated for 
closing by the military, would be available. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finally coming to the conclusion that recycling is good," Byrnes said. 
"Why not recycle an airport and leave the environment alone?"

INITIATIVE BID OPENS TO FIGHT GOLF COURSE 
</P>

<P>
A group of residents Friday launched an initiative drive to require voter 
approval before the city develops or sells any city park or beach. The city 
clerk's office approved the organization's application to circulate petitions, 
clearing the way for the start of the signature-gathering effort. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which calls itself Save Our Parks, plans next week to begin 
collecting the estimated 20,000 signatures needed to qualify the proposed city 
charter amendment for either the June or November, 1990, ballot, said Debbie 
Cook, the group's chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
If the group fails to gather the required signatures within two months to 
prompt a June ballot measure, it would have an additional four months to 
qualify the proposal for November. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident that we'll be able to collect the needed signatures," 
Cook said Friday. "We have a number of people, in all parts of the city, who 
are very excited about this." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the group's campaign is an effort to prevent the City Council 
from following through on plans to construct an 18-hole, 105-acre golf course 
on unimproved land at Central Park, straddling Golden West Street at Ellis 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks was formed in September after the council's 5-2 decision to move 
forward with the golf course, and since then, it has been working with 
attorneys to forge the wording of the charter-amendment proposal. Members 
charge that the golf course would cut into land that is now used for a variety 
of recreational activities, including cross-country running by local high 
school athletes, jogging, bird-watching and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
"Our point, above all, is that the people should decide what this land should 
be," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Wes Bannister, who has led the drive for the golf course, said he doubts 
that the group can muster the number of signatures needed. 
</P>
<P>
But Bannister said he encourages the group's effort. "I'm glad to see them 
doing what they're doing. . . . I think the initiative process is good," he 
said. "I don't necessarily believe in its efficiency, but it least it gets the 
issues out in the open, where people can get informed about what's really going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Peter M. Green, who has joined with Council member Grace Winchell in 
opposing the golf course, said, "This council has been much more generous to 
developers than it should be." He charged that supporters of the course have 
"jettisoned the democratic process" by excluding resident suggestions about the 
fate of the Central Park land. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister and others promoting the golf course say that the city cannot afford 
to renovate the targeted land for passive park use. He estimates it would cost 
the city $10 million to landscape and light the unimproved area. 
</P>
<P>
Under the golf course plans, however, the city would lease the land to American 
Golf Corp., which would build the course, and the resulting revenues would 
bolster the city's general fund by $200,000 to $500,000 per year, Bannister 
said. Opponents strongly challenge those figures, pointing out that the city's 
Meadowlark Golf Course, a facility of comparable size, brings in about $100,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
The city is required under a relocation agreement with Ocean View Mobile Home 
Park residents to construct a nine-hole golf course at Central Park. However, 
that course could be as modest as a "pitch-and-putt" facility and an 18-hole 
course is not necessary, park preservationists say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to preserving the Central Park land, the group's initiative seeks 
to block the city's Pierside Village project, a $26-million plan calling for 
four restaurants and 20,000 square feet of retail shops along the south side of 
the now-closed city pier, and to preserve undeveloped bluff areas at Bolsa 
Chica State Beach, Cook said. JOHN PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Local apartment and condominium owners should find it easier to sell their 
property now that city officials have recommended specific changes in the 
nonconforming-use provisions of the city's zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with the recommendations of the city's planning manager, the City 
Council decided to reaffirm its intent to modify amortization and 
reconstruction provisions in the zoning code that would make overly dense 
apartments and condominiums in the city more attractive to lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a 1978 zoning change that reduced the number of allowable units per 
acre, about 10% of the city's multifamily housing units do not conform to 
current density standards, according to a report by Michael Bouvier, the city's 
planning manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council urged the city's Planning Commission to begin procedures to adopt a 
zoning-ordinance amendment that would remove the requirement that multifamily 
developments, which do not meet current density limits, must be removed or 
modified when "grandfather" provisions to exempt them expire.

Most people don't see a portable cooler as a life-saving device -- but a group 
of Orange County doctors does. 
</P>
<P>
The coolers, filled with medical supplies, were on display at UCI Medical 
Center on Friday as about 40 Orange County physicians learned how to respond 
during a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The unique two-day course is designed to teach doctors -- who are accustomed to 
working in hospitals -- how to put their skills to use at the scene of an 
emergency, far away from an emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the very first program like this in the world," said Dr. Robert Bade, 
co-creator of Medical Disaster Response, the organization that developed the 
training program. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors were taught how to make the best use of the supplies in the 
coolers, which will be placed at schools and businesses throughout the county, 
ready for the next earthquake or other disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Most doctors are used to working in a hospital with a tremendous number of 
supplies and equipment," said Dr. Michael Trainor, president-elect of the 
American College of Emergency Physicians. However, in a major earthquake, 
sections of the county could be cut off by collapsed freeways or landslides, he 
said. Supplies will be limited, so doctors need to learn to make the best use 
of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An injured person -- whose life could be saved in a hospital under normal 
circumstances -- might not survive in a disaster because of limited 
transportation and supplies, Trainor said. Faced with that knowledge, a doctor 
might not want to use all of his supplies on a person with such poor chances, 
he said. But that is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are not used to holding back," said Dr. Bob DiLorenzo, an emergency 
medical instructor at the medical center. "Some victims will have to be left to 
die," he said, so that others can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the supply coolers stationed throughout the county, these 
doctors will have specially stocked "backpacks" in their cars, said Bade, the 
medical director in charge of the county's emergency medical services agency. 
"The days of the little black bag are gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My son came in one day after falling off his skateboard, and I realized I did 
not have a Band-Aid in my house," said Dr. Robert Kingston, who created the 
program with Bade. Now Kingston carries one of the backpacks in his car. 
</P>
<P>
The backpacks cost about $1,200 and contain supplies to treat about six people, 
Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
So are the backpacks cost-effective? 
</P>
<P>
"They are if you talk to the six people (saved)," Trainor said. It sounds like 
a lot of money until you consider the alternatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the doctor can improve someone's condition, even a little, then the 
patient's lifelong medical expenses will be reduced, because less care will be 
required once that person reaches the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings from one person's medical expenses would probably offset (the cost 
of) 100 backpacks," Trainor said. JAMES ROBBINS

JUDGE SAYS PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE MAKING SOUND PROGRESS IN CUTTING CONCERT NOISE 
</P>

<P>
A Superior Court judge said Friday that the loud music at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre, which lures rock 'n' roll fans and infuriates neighbors, 
continues to exceed recommended noise levels but that the facility has made 
significant progress in easing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's remarks by Judge Richard J. Beacom followed the latest conference with 
attorneys for the 18,500-seat bowl in Costa Mesa and noise-weary neighbors, who 
have been slugging it out in court for six years. 
</P>
<P>
While the judge was in his chambers with lawyers, several people who live near 
the bowl complained that the noise is still a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Some concerts are quieter, but most still violate the correct levels," said 
Russell Millar, who lives 800 feet from the stage and is president of Concerned 
Citizens of Costa Mesa Inc. "When you can hear it inside your home with the 
windows closed, it's too loud." 
</P>
<P>
Beacom has ordered lawyers not to discuss the case with the news media, but he 
agreed to summarize the closed-door meeting for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The judge acknowledged that the latest round of noise-monitoring shows that 11 
of the 12 concerts held between Aug. 3 and Oct. 18 exceeded the levels 
specified by an earlier court order. But he said they are still lower than 
noise levels recorded during last year's concert season. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we've made a lot of progress in this respect," Beacom said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the amphitheater installed new sound equipment designed to 
contain the noise, but most artists initially refused to use it, Beacom said. 
Recently, the trend has shifted and most performers use the new system, 
resulting in a lower noise level, Beacom said. 
</P>
<P>
"Use of the house equipment has reduced noise levels in the community and at 
the same time has not diminished the quality of the performances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beacom said he believes bowl operators are "making too much progress" in 
solving noise, traffic and parking problems for him to consider resuming the 
trial, which was suspended in July, 1988, to give amphitheater officials time 
to make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The owners and operators of the amphitheater renewed their offer to settle the 
case Friday, but they proposed no specifics, Beacom said. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiff Laurie Lusk said the defendants "offered to buy me off" by paying an 
unspecified sum of money and abiding by a contract to keep the noise under 
control. She said that another hearing is set for Nov. 22 but that she is less 
interested in money than in quiet for all the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of think we won't accept (a settlement) unless we get noise reduction 
and some punitive damages for the six or seven years this has taken out of 
everybody's lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Millar lamented the dispute, recalling the day when the $11-million 
amphitheater was only a good-sounding idea. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was first proposed, they told us it would be an amphitheater for 
chamber music and Shakespearean plays," Millar said. "We thought it was a great 
idea. But we've never heard either one in there."

ACCUSED SURGEON LOSES COURT ROUND TO HIS CREDITORS 
</P>

<P>
Creditors of Thomas A. Gionis, the Pomona surgeon accused of masterminding an 
attack on his ex-wife, Aissa Wayne, won a crucial bankruptcy ruling Friday that 
forces Gionis to liquidate part of his assets to pay off his debts. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 creditors, including Wayne, daughter of John Wayne, asked federal 
Bankruptcy Judge David N. Naugle in San Bernardino to convert the bankruptcy 
for Gionis' medical corporation from a Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7. The change 
allows a court-appointed trustee to sell the surgeon's assets for the benefit 
of his creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said that court documents indicate the corporate assets alone are 
worth at least $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis had blocked access to financial documents and invoked the Fifth 
Amendment 67 times when questioned during a deposition, said Richard Marshak, a 
Santa Ana attorney and court-sanctioned counsel for a host of unsecured 
creditors.Neither Gionis nor his bankruptcy attorney, Fred Cohen, could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal trial for Gionis, who is accused of masterminding the attack on 
Wayne and her then-boyfriend, financier Roger W. Luby, is scheduled to begin 
Nov. 28. However, Gionis' attorneys said Friday that they plan to seek a 
continuance next week to at least February. Superior Court Judge Everett W. 
Dickey reduced Gionis' bail from $250,000 to $100,000 although Gionis' 
attorneys had requested a reduction to $25,000. He has pleaded innocent to the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Luby were attacked on Oct. 3, 1988, at Luby's $3-million Newport 
Beach estate. They said two men smashed their faces on a concrete floor and 
slashed Luby's right Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Gionis filed for protection from his creditors in federal bankruptcy 
court. The filing has prevented his ex-wife from collecting a $1.3-million 
judgment awarded to her earlier this year as part of their divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Before his legal problems began, Gionis had a flourishing private orthopedic 
practice and had five Southland medical clinics. Gionis has also filed personal 
bankruptcy and bankruptcy on behalf of a partnership, Multiple Specialty Group 
of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon drove a Ferrari and lived with Wayne and the couple's 2-year-old 
daughter, Anastasia, in an estate in the Phillips Ranch area of Pomona. Wayne, 
after a stormy custody battle, was granted custody of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Naugle accused Gionis of "bad management" when he learned 
that Gionis had drawn a $4,000-a-week salary from the corporation but had 
neglected to take out any withholding tax, said Timothy J. Farris, an attorney 
in charge of the U.S. Trustee Office in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Farris said that after an Aug. 25 meeting between Gionis, his attorney and 
attorneys for his creditors, it was agreed that Gionis could take out a 
$4,000-a-week corporate salary "provided he get medical malpractice insurance." 
</P>
<P>
"Without the insurance, he could not treat patients," Farris said. "We said 
that if he was an operating doctor he should be entitled to the salary. He 
applied for the insurance but he never got it." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon's belligerence and uncooperative nature prompted the government to 
concur with his creditors and their motion Friday before Judge Naugle, Farris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For two months, because (Gionis) failed to provide interim financial 
statements, I didn't know what was going on with the money for the 
corporation," Farris said.

SIMMERING RIVALRY BOILS AGAIN

<P>
The Rivalry Continues, in more ways than one would suspect. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there seems to be a rivalry as to just how big the rivalry 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really thought of it as a rivalry," says Bret Johnson, representing 
UCLA, El Toro High School and little quarterbacks everywhere. "Obviously, the 
papers labeled it that. But when we played, I didn't think about competing 
against Todd. I just thought about a win." 
</P>
<P>
Rebuttal to Todd Marinovich, wearing the colors of USC, Capistrano Valley High 
and the Marv Marinovich School of CompuQuarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, there's a little tension," Marinovich says. "Some things have been said, 
some things that I can't really repeat. Things he said -- to me and to others. 
That's kind of affected it." 
</P>
<P>
Bret and Todd, butting heads again. 
</P>
<P>
By any designation -- cold war, uneasy truce, grudging acquaintance -- the 
Johnson-Marinovich relationship hasn't progressed much since the fall of 1987, 
since they last vied for national honor, personal pride and the South Coast 
League championship. 
</P>
<P>
They still call the same city home, but Mission Viejo can be as big and as 
insular as one wants to make it. 
</P>
<P>
For years they shared the same quarterback coach, but Bill Cunerty still can't 
talk them into sharing dinner. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as they prepare for their first clash as starting quarterbacks at UCLA 
and USC, Johnson and Marinovich still can't resist the long-distance needle, 
still keenly aware of the other's pressure points. 
</P>
<P>
Such as Johnson's height. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they must be feeding him bad at UCLA," Marinovich says with a sly 
grin. "In high school, he was listed at 6-2. Now he's 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
Or Marinovich's upbringing as Robo-QB. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his father worked very hard at getting Todd to where he is now," 
Johnson pointedly points out. 
</P>
<P>
Or Johnson's lack of success as quarterback with the 3-7 Bruins during the 
worst season UCLA has had since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't figure it out," Marinovich says, straight-faced. "They recruited at 
least 15 high school All-Americans. I can't figure out what it's been." 
</P>
<P>
What's left unsaid is the success Marinovich has experienced across town. USC 
is headed for the Rose Bowl. Marinovich, a redshirt freshman forced into the 
starting lineup when Pat O'Hara was injured, has completed 63% of his passes 
and has thrown for 2,246 yards, which already ranks him eighth on the Trojans' 
career passing yardage list. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, has a response for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that every quarterback would want to play for a team that has one of 
the best defenses in the country," Johnson says. "If the quarterback is 
talented at all, he's going to do well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too hard to figure out. When the other team is always getting three 
downs and a punt, you're going to get a lot of chances as a quarterback. There 
are so many opportunities for the offense to be a success -- and they've 
surrounded Todd with good offensive players." 
</P>
<P>
Point, counterpoint. Same as it ever was. 
</P>
<P>
Cunerty, the Saddleback College quarterback coach who has known both Johnson 
and Marinovich since they were 8, wishes the two could find common ground 
beyond the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything, and everyone, seems to be polarized around them," Cunerty says. 
"If you like Bret, you have to hate Todd. If you like Todd, you have to hate 
Bret. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell people to look at it another way. We're blessed to have two 
players of their stature come from this area." 
</P>
<P>
He has tried to sell the same line of thinking to Johnson and Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"They are no longer just South Orange County kids," Cunerty says. "Now, they 
are national role models. I'd love to see them become really good friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen this situation so many times in my 21 years of coaching. You have 
these intense rivals on the field and they automatically think, 'I have to hate 
him to beat him.' I don't think that has to be the way. 
</P>
<P>
"As they continue to grow, they may develop a mutual respect for each other. If 
so, I think both of them will benefit. If you approach it that way, there are 
no losers." 
</P>
<P>
Cunerty admits he isn't holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Bosom buddies, I don't think that will ever happen," he says with a laugh. 
"They'll probably never shoot hoops together. . .. " "I enjoy being around both 
kids and I've always wanted to get them together. But they're not too crazy 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
For now, annual meetings at the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl will have to 
suffice. The first of a possible four commences today. 
</P>
<P>
"And maybe five years from now, they'll get drafted by the Raiders and the 
Rams," Cunerty says. "And after that, there'll be a Legends football league and 
they'll join that. We could have this go on for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps by then, they'll stop shaking fists long enough to shake hands.

COURT REJECTS SAVANNA BID TO RE-ENTER THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Savanna High School lost its bid to be reinstated to the Southern Section 
playoffs Friday when an Orange County Superior Court commissioner ruled that 
the team had been properly removed from the postseason by Orange League 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna, which won its first league title in the school's history, was forced 
to forfeit its six victories, a tie, a share of the league championship and a 
spot in the Division VI playoffs because of an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels were originally scheduled to play Fullerton Friday night in a 
first-round game, but were replaced by Brea-Olinda after it was discovered that 
a Savanna player was a fifth-year senior. 
</P>
<P>
The Savanna booster club went to court Thursday in an attempt to get the team 
back into the playoffs. However, Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk ruled Friday that 
there were no grounds to reinstate the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no abuse of discretion or violation of the rules," Cimbaluk said. "They 
(league principals) didn't arbitrarily disqualify the team. They had the right 
to do so under the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Savanna maintained that league rules were vague concerning forfeits and that 
resolution of a case such as this was not clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
They also argued that rule No. 2910 in the Southern Section rule book 
stipulates that "the Commissioner of Athletics may affect the protested players 
only and not render the team ineligible." 
</P>
<P>
"We never challenged the CIF over the eligibility of the player," Savanna Coach 
Fred DiPalma said. "We felt we were in the playoffs and there were no grounds 
to remove us." 
</P>
<P>
The decision ended a week of litigation involving three Southern Section teams; 
Huntington Beach, Savanna and La Puente all sought reinstatement to the 
playoffs after using alleged ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Huntington Beach won a temporary restraining order in Superior Court, 
allowing it back into the playoffs. But Thursday, that decision was stayed in 
favor of the Southern Section by the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente's bid was turned down in Pomona Superior Court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Savanna case, Cimbaluk questioned the right of the team's booster club, 
which took up the case, to seek a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts will not interfere with the discipline or expulsion of members of 
private organizations or associations where the action was taken in good faith 
in accordance with its rules," Cimbaluk said. 
</P>
<P>
After the decision was announced, DiPalma and Savanna principal William Wong 
met with the team and informed the players of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Huntington Beach ruling, we expected this," DiPalma said. "The 
seniors took it the hardest because they won't get another chance to play. The 
underclassmen and the coaches are already getting ready for next season."

U.S. TAKES OVER SECURITY S&amp;L IN GARDEN GROVE

Government regulators seized control of Security Federal Savings &amp; Loan on 
Friday, declared the one-office thrift insolvent and placed it into the federal 
conservatorship program. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third Orange County-based S&amp;L to be seized this year. The action 
does not disrupt normal business, and customers on Friday continued making 
deposits and withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
But the action is a prelude to the sale or closing of the 32-year-old community 
S&amp;L, which has $77 million in assets and $75.2 million in deposits in 6,035 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Pending that final disposition, Security -- now operating as Security Federal 
Savings Assn. -- will be run by a representative of the new Resolution Trust 
Corp., an agency created by the thrift bail-out bill to operate and dispose of 
insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Security was among seven local thrifts identified by a number of industry 
analysts as being unable to meet capital requirements that take effect Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift lost $202,000 in the second quarter and since then has lost at least 
$960,000 more, wiping out its entire capital base. 
</P>
<P>
Security's problems stem from a series of bad loans made by previous management 
in the early 1980s, just before the county's residential housing boom turned 
into a two-year bust. 
</P>
<P>
While it has not had serious operating problems since then, it was never able 
to build up enough business to offset the drain on its resources from those 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the government stepped in to name a management team after a hoped-for 
private sale of the S&amp;L fell through. At the time, regulators said Security 
needed a minimum of $2.5 million in new capital to remain solvent.

COMPUTER FIRM REPORTS LOSING $6 MILLION IN YEAR

Computer Automation Inc. said Friday it lost $6 million in the fiscal year 
ended June 30, and the firm's chairman said the losses "have seriously affected 
the company's cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
The company, which manufactures automatic test equipment and minicomputers, 
said it also expects to report a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1990, 
which ended Sept. 30. Computer Automation was late in reporting its year-end 
financial figures, but said results for the first quarter will be released 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which has been in financial straits for the past two years, said its 
revenue for fiscal 1989 fell to $6.4 million, down 10.6% from $7.1 million a 
year earlier. The loss for the recent year compares with a $1.3 million loss in 
the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
Computer Automation's efforts to raise badly needed cash were dealt a blow 
recently when a deal to sell its automatic test business to Technology 
Marketing Inc. of Irvine for $4.1 million fell through.

ATKINS TO SING 'KINDERTOTENLIEDER' -- AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: AFTER ONCE CANCELING THE MAHLER WORK BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, 
THE SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY IS GOING TO TRY AGAIN TONIGHT, WITH THE SAME BARITONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight, John Atkins will sing Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder" with the South 
Coast Symphony, the baritone's first public performance of the work. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the amount of time Atkins has had to ruminate over these "Songs 
on the Death of Children," a well-pondered interpretation should be in the 
offing when Atkins takes the Robert B. Moore Theatre stage at Orange Coast 
College. 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, the second time Atkins has been prepared to sing this set 
with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the contract had been signed, sealed and delivered well ahead of 
the scheduled January performance. Atkins had already labored over the vocal 
subtleties of the emotion-packed "Kindertotenlieder" when the call came: 
management of the orchestra had been forced to cancel the concert due to 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the financial health of a young artist's emerging career? 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the perfect time to have a canceled contract," Atkins said during a 
phone interview last week. No monetary compensation was offered, though South 
Coast music director Larry Granger expressed determination to honor canceled 
commitments later. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was agreed that Atkins would receive the originally determined fee 
if the concert were rescheduled within one year. If not, or if Granger 
requested another work, orchestra management would come to some agreement with 
Atkins' agents (Trawick Artists) regarding additional payment for previous time 
and effort. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atkins has not been idle. Encouraged by winning the Western Regional 
Metropolitan Opera auditions in 1987, at the age of 29, he entered the Victor 
Fuchs Auditions and the Loren Zachary Foundation Competition this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Competitions can be a good thing because they help to pay the bills as a young 
singer," Atkins said, though he also pointed out that competition winners are 
not always able to sustain a role or maintain a career. 
</P>
<P>
Other concert engagements have also busied Atkins in the interim. Last May, 
Atkins was twice featured soloist with the Pacific Symphony, first in Copland's 
"Old American Songs" and later in Britten's "War Requiem" (with the William 
Hall Chorale). 
</P>
<P>
If tonight's performance is Atkins' first attempt at the "Kindertotenlieder," 
it is not his first plunge into the heady Romanticism of Mahler; last season, 
he debuted with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, in their Saturday morning series 
for young people, with Mahler's "Songs of a Wayfarer." 
</P>
<P>
Neither will the South Coast Symphony date constitute the initial catalyst for 
Atkins' intensive study of the "Kindertotenlieder" -- the sorrow-laden cycle 
provided the subject for his Oklahoma City University master's thesis. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me look at this piece and say, 'Why does it work?' But, when push 
comes to shove, and it's time to perform, one hopes that all the 
intellectualism gets thrown out and the piece's emotion speaks. The most 
important things are simple things that touch people." 
</P>
<P>
Atkins sees nothing simple about singing with orchestra, however. Unlike opera, 
in which the singer can recoup his energies backstage after a shaky opening 
scene, in concert, "when the orchestra starts you have to be prepared to do 
what you're going to do for (in this case) the next 30 minutes. . . . You've 
got to be ready when the gun goes off." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean he would prefer to confine himself to opera? During the 1987-88 
season, Atkins participated in a variety of productions with the Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera, including Starveling in Britten's "A Midsummer Night's 
Dream" and Dandini in the touring group for Rossini's "Cenerentola." Beginning 
January, he will be back at the Music Center, where he will sing in all five 
works scheduled this season. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Atkins would gladly seize opportunities for further concert work. 
The risk is part of the attraction: "Maybe successfully sticking out my neck 
makes the most gratifying experience." 
</P>
<P>
Atkins will not be the only performer enticed by artistic peril tonight, for 
this will be the first time Granger has programmed a work by Mahler. During a 
conversation Monday, the conductor noted that orchestra members had been eager 
to remedy that omission. And, with financial recovery well in sight, the time 
has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Baritone John Atkins joins the South Coast Symphony in a program of works by 
Mahler, Handel and Beethoven tonight at 8:15 p.m. in the Robert B. Moore 
Theater at Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $12 
to $25. Information: (714) 432-5527.

A 'REINVENTED' JANE FONDA LOOKS AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITY: AFTER HER BREAKUP WITH TOM HAYDEN, THE ACTRESS HAS A NEW MAN IN HER 
LIFE AND THE EXCITEMENT OF NEW FILM PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From North America Syndicate 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last February, Jane Fonda's 16-year marriage to Tom Hayden fell apart, and she 
embarked on the most painful period of her life. She hadn't been seen onscreen 
for three years, unless you count the home video where she huffs and puffs and 
helps America blow the fat away. Choice roles that once might have been hers 
were going to younger actresses named Weaver, Winger and Field. She became 
depressed, dependent on friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
This was certainly not the feisty woman who thrust herself into the protests 
against the Vietnam War. Nor was it the prescient woman, open to the values of 
a new generation, who went on to make millions from her exercise tapes as 
standard-bearer of the health and fitness era. But now, time has brought forth 
a vital Jane, a reconstituted Jane. At 51, she says, laughing, "I've reinvented 
myself -- again." She's happier than she's been in years. For one thing there 
is a new man in her life, an Italian actor 17 years her junior, Lorenzo 
Caccialanza. She met him last May at a birthday party, and according to 
friends, he seems to be the right medicine for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is her excitement about two new films: The recently released "Old 
Gringo" and the upcoming "Stanley &amp; Iris." 
</P>
<P>
Although close friends were surprised that Fonda and Hayden called it quits, 
there had been reports of Hayden's flirtation with booze and women for years 
(Hayden denies the boozing and refuses to comment on his private life.) Says 
one friend of the marriage: "Most of us assumed it was an arrangement of sorts. 
They were getting what they needed from each other -- at least publicly. But 
clearly, they had fewer things in common the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
The final straw was apparently Hayden's serious involvement with a political 
speech writer, and Fonda, who always fights until she has nothing to lose, gave 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, she had to come to terms with three things she had rarely 
experienced: solitude, rejection and failure. "You don't understand a 
relationship until it's over," she says. "I've gone through so many changing 
emotions over the last nine months that I can't offer any final judgments. In 
the beginning I thought it was women who do most of the work to keep marriages 
together. But now I would just say everyone has to work really hard to make 
them succeed. You keep going until the will is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Leaned on Friends 
</P>
<P>
Their group of friends didn't see much of Hayden for a while, but they were 
touched by how Fonda reached out to them. "Leaned on them is right!" she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her children, too, Vanessa, 21, and Troy, 16, rallied in a way that surprised 
even their mother. Vanessa returned from Africa, where she was making a film 
with her fahter, director Roger Vadim. "I didn't realize how wise she was," 
says Fonda. "It was an interesting role-reversal where the kid became the 
parent. The funny thing is we're all much closer now. Separating is the most 
painful thing I've ever been through, largely because you're constantly 
wondering: How much emotion do I show the children? There is a delicate balance 
between not using the kids as a battlefield and not shutting them out. You 
always have to think of them first." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hard transition from the time when the dynamics between Fonda and 
Hayden were, well, dynamic. Intellectually ravenous, Fonda delighted in his 
brilliance and, of course, he benefited financially and publicly with her 
behind him. He waged an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate and 
eventually won a seat in the California Assembly. And when pressing commitments 
left them with less and less time to spend together, Hayden joked that if they 
found themselves alone at night, it was because one of their secretaries had 
screwed up. As a public presence, though, she clearly overshadowed him. Yet 
friends recount feeling that she seemed smaller and more sullen with Hayden, 
less willing to let herself go. "She seemed," says one, "afraid to crack a joke 
or speak her mind without being put down." 
</P>
<P>
At the softball games at the couple's Santa Barbara ranch, Tom dominated. 
Longtime friend Sam Hurst, a TV producer, recounts: "A few weekends ago I was 
up there with Jane and a group, and when she got in the game I realized it was 
the first time in 15 years that I'd seen her on the field. She struck out, but 
she just laughed. Until then she had never put herself in a situation where she 
might fail." 
</P>
<P>
Casual Living 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, she is the picture of ease, sitting in her Santa Monica house, 
which has been described as "criminally modest" for a multimillionaire movie 
star. It is casually decorated with rugs, family photos and art by Henry Fonda. 
Warhol's portraits of the woman who has had far more than her allotted 15 
minutes of fame line the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Gringo" is on her mind as she prepares for a trip halfway around the world 
to promote the film. Her characterization of the spinster, Harriet Winslow, 
obsessed her, she says. She pored over history books, researching women in the 
post-Civil War era. They were among the first to go off to college, only to 
come home and find that no one wanted them to get smart. Fonda kept a journal, 
much as she imagined Harriet would, but the character really took shape for her 
when she put on the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you wear a corset for a long period of time, you can't show much emotion 
without passing out," Fonda explains. "Sex must have been interesting too. 
Every shoe had 100 buttons, and there were three layers of underwear. Either it 
ruined the moment or they had to find creative ways of making those moments." 
</P>
<P>
Fonda's co-workers are struck by this painstaking professionalism. "She works 
very hard to make every scene perfect," says Gregory Peck. "But she's also able 
to laugh, and we developed a very warm relationship over four months. I've told 
her what a gift she's given me with this part, because there aren't many 
romantic roles for a man over 70." 
</P>
<P>
'A Bear for Work' 
</P>
<P>
"Stanley &amp; Iris" director Martin Ritt, whose previous direction brought 
Oscars to Sally Field and Patricia Neal, calls her "a bear for work." Ritt had 
his work cut out for him because Fonda and costar Robert De Niro have very 
different working styles. She likes to rehearse a lot and hang out with the 
gang. De Niro likes hanging out with himself and doing the work as fresh and 
raw as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It was lonely working with him," admits Fonda, but says, "when the camera was 
on, we were very involved, and there was something exciting about working with 
someone so brilliant, doing it his own way." The next step for the versatile 
actress will be to find roles that accurately reflect the lives of women in her 
age group. "Frankly, there wouldn't be enough parts for me if I didn't produce. 
There are fewer parts for women in general unless you're of a certain age and 
really hot. But around 45 to 65, most actresses' careers stop." 
</P>
<P>
One of her concerns is to give what she calls a "cultural face" to middle age, 
to change the popular image of mature women, and show them as vital, sexual 
beings. "I can't play glamorous anymore," she claims. "It's not what you do at 
my age. But I can still play sensual women. The definition of movie stardom is 
sex, and there has to be some of that in you." 
</P>
<P>
She has had her share of good sex on the screen. Kris Kristofferson and Donald 
Sutherland come quickly to mind. In "Gringo," there is a prolonged love scene 
with Smits, whom she is convinced will emerge from this film a major sex 
symbol. "At Cannes, no one knew him when they went in to see the film, but when 
it was over, the women were coming on to him in droves." 
</P>
<P>
Tabloid Headlines 
</P>
<P>
Staying sexy in a business that constantly falls in and out of love with its 
stars can produce many a vulnerability. Fonda was pained this year when the 
tabloids not only screamed details of her husband's infidelity but also 
reported that she'd had breast implants. It is an issue she won't discuss but 
it even troubles and confuses her closest friends. "Here's the fitness guru of 
the nation who's obviously somewhat frightened," says a longtime neighbor in 
Santa Monica. "We were shocked when she showed up with these pointy mountains. 
I think many of us felt she's a feminist who shouldn't have to do this. But we 
loved her, and it only shows that in some ways Jane still doesn't know exactly 
who she is." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, what many thought would happen to her post-Hayden -- that she'd 
turn more Hollywood than political as a way of distancing herself from the 
concerns she shared with him -- has not. She can still be seen more often at 
political meetings than at Spago. On this particular morning, she is folding up 
tables from the night before when a group gathered at her house to discuss the 
issue of aid to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
And so, Fonda's mixture of vulnerability and toughness still surprises. What to 
make of a woman steely enough to push through and produce difficult film 
projects, who asks for rewriter after rewrite of a script, and yet whose fears 
never seem far from the surface. 
</P>
<P>
What Fonda sees herself doing in the not-too-distant future is staying close to 
nature and paring down her way of life. In two years, when Troy finishes high 
school, she will consider leaving Los Angeles, possibly moving to Montana where 
her brother, Peter, spends his time. "I just love the feeling of carrying 
everything I want on my back," she says. "I spent a lot of my childhood 
wandering in the wilderness which was where we lived, in an area above Sunset 
Boulevard. I guess we're always trying to return to our roots."

MALE MIDWIFE SAYS TOO MANY MEN MISSING OUT ON 'TERRIFIC' CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Guardian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite his mustache, Norman Taylor likes to think of himself as just one of 
the girls. But as one of only 12 or so practicing male midwives in Britain, out 
of an estimated 35,000, he is still a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 30, works in the delivery suite of the Princess Anne maternity hospital 
in Southampton. A midwife for five years, after eight years in general and 
psychiatric nursing, he has delivered nearly 200 babies and assisted in the 
births of many more. Confident and diplomatic, with a cheeky sense of humor, he 
chooses his words with care and is conscious of the fact that his sex gives him 
a voice often denied his female colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor admits that he has always liked children, but denies that there is 
anything special about male midwives. No unusual upbringing, flag-waving desire 
to break down stereotypes or superior qualities distinguish the men who choose 
to make a living helping babies into the world, he says. Instead, some women 
may mistakenly enter the "caring professions" because it is expected of them, 
rather than through genuine commitment. "Sensitivity and confidence are the 
qualities necessary for this job; it doesn't matter what sex midwives are as 
long as they really care about what they do."

What attracted Taylor to the profession was the mix of psychological and 
physical care. "I've been run off my feet as a midwife, and women can sometimes 
be acutely ill in pregnancy, but for the most part pregnant women are well 
people who are going through a normal physiological process. You have more time 
than in general nursing to concentrate on parent education and physiological 
care," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Taylor's insistence on being ordinary, there has been opposition to 
male midwifery since the first experimental schemes were set up in two London 
and Stirling hospitals in 1976. Men were finally allowed to train and practice 
on equal terms with women in September, 1983, but in six years the takeup has 
been slow and doubts persist. 
</P>
<P>
Ishbel Kargar, secretary of the 1,200-strong Assn. of Radical Midwives (ARM), 
which believes that midwives' traditional skills have been eroded by 
technological intervention and the decline in home births, says that some 
members regard male midwives with suspicion. "As an association we don't have a 
dogmatic view. But some members are violently against the whole idea and 
question the reasons for men wanting to get into midwifery. For some men it's a 
power trip. Midwifery and child-care have traditionally been women's field and 
men have only been involved in positions of power. Sex should not come into it 
because most men can be just as caring, but many of them use the qualification 
as a step on the promotion ladder." 
</P>
<P>
ARM allows men to become members, but the association's regional groups make 
their own rules and only two or three male midwives have joined. In one south 
London group they are banned, but this is partly because its meetings take 
place in a women's center. 
</P>
<P>
Some members have practical reservations about male midwives, as well as ones 
of principle. Kargar says that in times of worsening staff shortages, 
chaperoning -- whereby male midwives must be accompanied during procedures such 
as internal examinations -- can create problems. Women who might not wish to 
have a male midwife might also feel obliged to keep quiet for fear of being a 
nuisance in a busy ward, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, however, thinks that chaperoning can benefit patient and midwife. "If 
my integrity were questionable, I would not be employed as a midwife in the 
first place. But I have to be protected against accusations that may not have 
any grounds, and I believe it is preferable to have someone with you to comfort 
the patient. I never do a vaginal examination without first saying that this 
can be uncomfortable and undignified, but if you get distressed, then here is 
'X' to hold your hand." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has sympathy with some of ARM's views, but thinks members can be too 
hard on men. "I believe that men can be feminists, too, and can have the 
interests of women at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he feels that some radical midwives go too far on the issue of 
intervention-free childbirth. "I'm a supporter of natural childbirth and 
believe in women having choices, but you need to strike a balance. In an ideal 
world every baby would come out head first, face down, with no distress, but 
you get breeches, babies with growth retardation, large babies and small women 
-- the list is endless. Yes, be radical, but don't throw all caution to the 
wind." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, Taylor has never had much hassle over his choice of 
career. His parents and two sisters were "quietly proud" of his decision, and 
he expresses "enormous gratitude" to female colleagues, who have rarely created 
problems over his sex. 
</P>
<P>
Patients, too, after the initial surprise, have been supportive. Taylor fully 
respects the rights of women who, for religious or other reasons, may not wish 
to be attended by a male midwife. But on only one occasion has he had to 
withdraw tactfully from the delivery room, sensing that his presence was 
causing embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
After five years in the job, Taylor says it is still "terrific" to witness the 
beginning of life. He regrets, however, that no other men have been through the 
system at Princess Anne during his time there, and believes they might be 
missing out. "I see no reason why men shouldn't become midwives, as long as 
they have the right qualities. After all, I'm living proof, aren't I?"

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 'NORMA JEAN' TELLS STORY OF AN AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world knew her as Marilyn, the legendary blond bombshell with the breathy 
voice and the wiggle in her walk who heated up the silver screen during the 
Eisenhower years. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Jordan knew her as Norma Jean, a voluptuous teen-age model who, he says, 
became his lover in 1943 and remained a close friend through her meteoric rise 
in Hollywood to her mysterious death in 1962 at age 36. 
</P>
<P>
It's the off-screen personality that retired actor Jordan, a resident of 
Leisure World in Laguna Hills, captures in his book "Norma Jean: My Secret Life 
with Marilyn Monroe" (Morrow; $18.95). 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's portrait of Monroe is not a pretty picture. 
</P>
<P>
According to his account of the much-written-about actress, she occasionally 
earned extra cash by picking up men in hotel bars when she was a teen-ager 
married to James Dougherty, who was in the merchant marine. She was a sexually 
uninhibited woman who had intimate relations with both men and women and 
ruthlessly used the proverbial casting couch to her advantage. She was 
introduced to "uppers and downers" in the '40s by Jordan's uncle, nightclub 
entertainer Ted Lewis, who kept her supplied with pills in exchange for sex. 
Always insecure, she became increasingly depressed and dependent on drugs and 
alcohol in the last few years of what Jordan calls "the Greek tragedy of her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who was prompted by previous Monroe biographies, particularly those 
claiming that she was murdered, began writing his book in 1982. According to 
the various conspiracy theories, Monroe was murdered by the CIA or Jimmy Hoffa 
or the Mafia because of her relationships with John and Robert Kennedy. Jordan, 
who says he received a phone call from the actress the evening she died, does 
not believe anyone killed her: "She killed herself." 
</P>
<P>
"I had read most all the books" about Monroe, said Jordan, 65, "and I saw all 
this crap written about her, mostly from people who never knew her -- 
especially Norman Mailer. His book was so inaccurate. I said: 'I'm going to sit 
down and write a book about the girl that my brother remembers meeting, that my 
mom -- God bless her -- still remembers meeting, and write the true story about 
her.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, a review of a previous edition of the book published in England raised 
questions about the accuracy of some of the dates and alleged incidents in the 
book such as Jordan saying he had a one-night fling in 1946 with actress Lupe 
Velez to make Monroe jealous when Velez actually died in 1944. Television's 
"Entertainment Tonight" also took a critical assessment of "Norma Jean," 
raising similar questions and interviewing friends of Monroe who say Jordan 
never knew the actress. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jordan said, "I'm not asking anybody to believe me, but I can 
tell you that there are a lot of people alive today that know about my affair 
and knew me when." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who was born in Ohio, said that he was a 19-year-old struggling actor 
working as a lifeguard at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1943 when he 
met the 17-year-old fledgling model. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Jean then bore little resemblance to Marilyn, the soon-to-be manufactured 
screen legend. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, according to Jordan, she was a pretty "but far from beautiful 
girl. She had mousy, kinky hair. She had eyebrows that were straight across; 
they weren't arched. She had an under bite, she had a mole -- a seed wart they 
call it -- and she was very unkempt. She was very filthy about her body." 
</P>
<P>
But her body, which Jordan still describes in crudely appreciative terms, made 
men's heads turn. In his book, he says she "positively radiated sex." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean once you saw her, you never forgot her," he said, conceding that his 
initial interest in her was based on "strictly a physical attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe had joined the Blue Book Modeling Agency, which had an office at the 
Ambassador Hotel. Jordan remembers seeing her do her first swimsuit photo 
session next to the pool at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"She couldn't act, she couldn't stand, she couldn't look at the camera," he 
said. "You would never say this girl is ever going to amount to anything. 
Absolutely never. She never would have made it the way she was. I mean, it was 
a different person." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that when he asked Monroe out for a date, she seemed unimpressed 
until he told her that his uncle was the entertainer Ted Lewis, who was 
appearing at a local nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
By their fourth date, Jordan writes, they had become intimate -- a scene Jordan 
re-creates in lurid detail in his book. They fell in love and, Jordan says, he 
wanted to marry Monroe, but her desire to make it in Hollywood was 
all-consuming -- to the point, he writes, that when she became pregnant by him 
she had an abortion because the studios wanted "nothing to do with starlets who 
were mothers." 
</P>
<P>
"When I first met her, she was a very naive -- I thought -- overdeveloped young 
girl for her age," he said. "Not too intelligent, not too much upstairs. Yet 
she could outwit you or outsmart you if she wanted to. You'd never think so 
being around her, but she could. 
</P>
<P>
"When she found out I got a Screen Actors Guild card was the first time I saw 
the bitchy part of her. She got jealous," he says, vowing to offer herself to 
even Bela Lugosi if doing so would advance her career. 
</P>
<P>
"We got into a terrible argument, and she started using words that I had never 
heard or used before. And all of a sudden I'm saying, 'Where the hell did she 
pick up all this stuff?' " 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's career took off like a skyrocket in the early '50s, but Jordan's 
barely got off the launching pad. He played small parts in a string of movies 
and landed a role on Broadway in "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial." He was later 
hired to play a small but regular role as the freight agent on his old friend 
James Arness' TV show, "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan also was married briefly in the '50s to famed blond striptease artist 
Lily St. Cyr, whom, he writes, Marilyn used as a model for her sexy screen 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the '50s, Jordan continued to see Monroe off and on and to talk to 
her on the phone. He said she would often call him late at night, her speech 
slurred by pills and booze. Jordan said Monroe was definitely suicidal and that 
"in the last 2 1/2 years of her life, she was drugged up all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said there's no denying allegations that Monroe slept with both John and 
Robert Kennedy. "I know it to be fact," he said. "I didn't just hear it, or 
hear the Hollywood gossip, I got it from her own mouth. She told me." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason he wrote his book, he said, is that "I wanted to straighten out 
the conspiracies about how Marilyn Monroe died." 
</P>
<P>
He refuses to believe that she was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," he said "I talked to her the night she died. She called me 
many nights, and she was so slurred and drunk and pilled up. I have someone 
very dear to me right now that calls me every night (and speaks in slurred 
speech). I tell you I get sick of it. I know one night I won't get a call, and 
she'll be gone. But this is what happened to Norma Jean." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Jordan writes that when Monroe called him that evening, she said 
in an especially slurred voice that she "just wanted to say so long." 
</P>
<P>
He asked, "Where are you going?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, on a trip," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
As she hung up, he writes, Monroe said, "Take care of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan says that at the time, he attached no special significance to the call. 
</P>
<P>
The next day he heard on his car radio that Marilyn Monroe was dead. 
</P>
<P>
In his criticism of "the extraordinary industry" that sprang up "centering on 
the question of her death," Jordan maintains in his book that Monroe's death 
was an accidental suicide. 
</P>
<P>
A side note: Last January, Jordan pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of 
making threatening telephone calls to the authors of two different books on 
Monroe who in the early '80s had asked the district attorney to exhume Monroe's 
body and reopen the case. Jordan was fined $1,000, put on three years' 
probation and served two days in jail. Jordan claims that he had been receiving 
constant phone calls from those two authors telling him not to release his book 
"because what I say in my book goes against what they say. As far as I'm 
concerned, I never even want to talk about these two fellas or ever see them 
again." 
</P>
<P>
As for Monroe's infamous missing red diary, in which she is said to have 
written sensitive government information, Jordan maintains that the diary does 
not contain government secrets. 
</P>
<P>
And how does he know? 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that Monroe gave him the diary a few days before she died and that 
he keeps it in a safe-deposit box. Instead of containing secret revelations 
about President Kennedy and the CIA, however, he said, it contains only her 
random thoughts and favorite stanzas of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"She used to recite beautiful poetry," Jordan said, adding that he still 
remembers the poems they used to read out loud together. "She was a 
romanticist. She was in love with love -- to the point where she never gave of 
herself enough, like most actresses, to be able to really fall for a guy. Not 
really."

GERMAN CLUB TO BRING 5 FAMILIES OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Phoenix Club, the Anaheim-based German-American social club, has raised 
$10,000 and has lined up local jobs and temporary homes to bring over five East 
German families to start new lives in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
However, the week-old project has already struck a bureaucratic snag. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what their status will be for entering (the United States) -- 
whether as refugees or more likely through normal channels," said Hans Klein of 
Orange, president of the organization, whose 3,500-family membership makes it 
the largest such club in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to get the official answers to that as soon as possible, but it's 
difficult because so many things are happening so quickly, and all at one 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Club members expected the families to be classified as political refugees, 
which would have accelerated their immigration. 
</P>
<P>
But any East Germans who settle in West Germany are regarded as West German 
citizens, said Klaus Aurisch, West Germany's deputy consul general in Los 
Angeles. As a result, those seeking entry to the United States would not be 
given refugee status and would be subject to general rules applying to West 
German citizens, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Bara, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's 
regional office in Laguna Niguel, concurred and said it was unclear how long it 
would take for East Germans to immigrate. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the hitches and delays, Klein said, the Phoenix Club's search is 
on for five East German families to sponsor. "Right now we have some people (in 
West Berlin) looking, although we realize both the search and the (immigration) 
process may take some time," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But prospects of a long wait have not dampened the euphoria that underscores 
the club's sponsorship project. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the club board at its regular bimonthly meeting Nov. 
10 at the height of celebration over East Germany's lifting of restrictions on 
immigration to the West and the opening of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting there watching the television (broadcasts from Berlin), and we 
made the decision on the spot," Klein recalled. "It was the case of saying, 
'How can we help best?' and realizing that sponsoring some families was the 
ideal way." 
</P>
<P>
It was a natural decision. Not only is the Phoenix Club a local landmark in 
Anaheim -- a community founded in the late 19th Century by a colony of German 
immigrant farmers -- but about 500 club members are themselves German 
immigrants, some of them escaping from East Germany after borders were closed 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of club families have already offered to provide homes for the new East 
German immigrants, Klein said, and "we have offers from companies for all kinds 
of possible jobs, such as cabinetmaking, painters and other trades." 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for families who do not have their own (family) sponsors in this 
country and who do not have the financial means to make the flight and start 
resettlement here," said Klein, the project's chief organizer. 
</P>
<P>
After they arrive, the new families are certain to get a whirlwind introduction 
to Southern California tourist sights, such as Disneyland, Hollywood and the 
beaches, but also dramatic exposure to the obstacles of assimilation and 
culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
Language, of course, is one. 
</P>
<P>
"We will start Saturday (English) classes for them at the club, just as we have 
German classes for the children of our own members," said Klein, 67, a 
restaurant consultant, who was raised in East Germany and immigrated here in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming change in life style is another barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who grew up under a very structured society, where everything 
-- their work, their homes, their thinking -- was decided for them," explained 
former club president Gunter Kunkel, 55, of Hacienda Heights, a print shop 
operator, who emigrated in 1956 from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Under that (East Germany) system, they were surviving, yes -- but not really 
living. And here in America, under a free and competitive society, they will 
find it hard to adjust and to compete." 
</P>
<P>
But Kunkel quickly added: "They will adjust, I'm sure. They will cope 
tremendously well." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with official breaching of the Berlin Wall taking place only a week 
ago, the emotions behind the Phoenix Club's sponsorship project remain 
euphoric. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a joyous moment (opening of the Wall), something none of us had expected 
to see in our lifetime," Klein said. "It must give them (East Germans) a 
feeling that nothing can hold them back now. They have found the beauty of 
freedom."
