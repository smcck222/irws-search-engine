COVER STORY: MORE MARY; 
</P>
<P>
MTM SAYS GOOD ROLES ARE HARD TO COME BY, BUT HERE'S HER SECOND TV MOVIE THIS 
MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

After Mary Tyler Moore's television series, "Annie McGuire," died quietly on 
CBS two years ago, the warm, familiar star silently stepped out of sight too. 
Frustrated by CBS' handling of the show and the shortage of roles for women 
over 50, she sold her production company, MTM, and built a country house in 
Upstate New York with her husband, Robert Levine. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid vegetable gardens and horses and dogs, Moore -- "Mary" to most of 
America -- did something that 35 years on the stage and screen have mostly 
prevented: She enjoyed her role as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily have the guts to take advantage of all the freedoms that I 
have," Moore said. "For example, when I was a co-owner of MTM, I never -- as 
Jane Fonda and a number of other actresses do -- developed my own projects. I 
just wanted to act. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have this country place, I love the serenity, and the gardening, 
and the horses and, you know, I practically carry on conversations with trees." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was taking a break on the set of the black comedy "Thanksgiving Day." The 
"NBC Monday Night Movie" depicts an off-center family coping with life after 
the death of their father, played by Tony Curtis, who drops dead in the 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is Moore's second this month -- "The Last Best Year" co-starring 
Bernadette Peters aired two weeks ago on ABC. The previous time that Moore 
starred in a dramatic television project was in 1987, in the NBC miniseries 
"Gore Vidal's Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are probably fewer roles written for women of a certain age, as 
they used to say," the five-time Emmy winner said politely, her hands folded in 
her lap. Moore spoke from inside her air-conditioned trailer on a dusty, 
stifling day in Malibu Canyon. Her hair was clipped comfortably short, and she 
wore tight faded jeans and a halter top, revealing a taut stomach that belied 
her 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
The former dancer traditionally has played women much younger than her age, but 
she says those days are over, as evidenced by her role as an eccentric widow 
trying to strike out on her own in "Thanksgiving Day." 
</P>
<P>
"What Mary shows is that women over 50 are still sexy, and are still funny, and 
are still vital," co-writer and producer Jeff Buhai said. "In one scene, she 
has a fantasy love dance in a supermarket with Nitro," one of the beefy stars 
of the syndicated "American Gladiators" TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that she can still portray youth, but "not without an awful lot of 
effort. I mean, they'd have to get out every light made in Hollywood and put it 
at just the right angle for me to play a young woman." 
</P>
<P>
After the beloved "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" folded in 1977, Moore dabbled in 
misfired TV series and variety shows, finding film success in "Ordinary People" 
and Broadway nods in "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and "Sweet Sue." She was also a 
hit in TV movies, notably "Heartsounds" with James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Moore was welcomed back by critics in "Annie McGuire," a subtle adult 
TV comedy series without a laugh track. But in a thicket of such fresh TV faces 
as Roseanne Barr and Candice Bergen, CBS scheduled the new thoroughly modern 
Mary in an 8:30 p.m. time slot, after the slapstick "Van Dyke Show" sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some genius thought that would be a nifty idea -- They're back to back 
and back together," Moore said, referring to her years on CBS as Laura Petrie, 
the perky wife on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" from 1961-66. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't belong in that time period," she said. "We weren't a children's 
show. We were aiming for a sophisticated audience, and we should have been on 
at 9 or 9:30 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she would ever return to television in a series, she resounded: 
"No! I really am not interested in doing a series again. What I'd like to 
continue -- well, no, it's just so damn disappointing . . . I'm just not going 
to do that again. I'm not going to put my blood and sweat and tears into 
something, and then have no control over the final and most important aspect of 
the making of a series, which is where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
In person, turning her emotions inside out, Moore was not unlike one of the 
sensitive, courageous women she often portrays. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffer . . . from low self-esteem," she said. "I mean, I'm getting better at 
it. God knows I ought to, by this time, with a lot of self-analysis and 
searching. I used to make myself the center of every disaster, and always blame 
myself whenever a project went wrong. But that can really be the result of a 
big ego." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Moore projects will come. In the meantime, what is the actress really 
looking forward to? 
</P>
<P>
She smiled distantly. 
</P>
<P>
"A new asparagus crop." 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving Day" airs Monday, 9-11 p.m. on NBC.

Q &amp; A / LOUIS RUKEYSER: A 
</P>
<P>
EADY ECONOMIC INDICATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PBS' "Wall 
</P>
<P>
reet Week with Louis Rukeyser," hosted by one of America's best-known and 
irreverent economic commentators and visited each week by the financial world's 
superstars, celebrates its 20th anniversary this month. 
</P>
<P>
The milestone is being marked this week on PBS by "Twenty Years of Wall 
</P>
<P>
reet with Louis Rukeyser," a retrospective of highlights from the past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Besides hosting the series, Rukeyser is the author of several best-selling 
books on economics and investing, including "What's Ahead for the Economy: The 
Challenge and the Chance." He also writes a syndicated newspaper column and 
lectures across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Rukeyser talked about his 20 years on "Wall 
</P>
<P>
reet Week" with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Do you remember any amazingly bad predictions economists have made over the 
last 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, the people who have been the most off-base most 
consistently are the extreme pessimists. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a moment, that fits into another theory of mine about life: If you 
know any young person in this country who has no conspicuous IQ or talent, but 
wants to live very well in America, I can solve that person's career problem 
for you right now. Tell them to become a professional economic pessimist. They 
need not know economics and they need never be right. Because I have discovered 
over the 20 years of doing this program that if you make one wrong optimistic 
prediction, no one will ever forgive you or forget you. But you can make 15 
wrong pessimistic predictions and everyone will forgive you. 
</P>
<P>
People who routinely predict catastrophe not only survive but flourish. I think 
the reason for that is that most people are scared to death about money. First, 
we think we will never get any and if somehow it comes our way, we think we 
will lose it tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when someone comes along and says, "Things are worse than you 
think," the tendency is to say "Oh, my gosh, I always thought so." And these 
guys have been predicting the end of American civilization since I have been 
around and are always at the top of the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think we are in a recession? 
</P>
<P>
Let's say it's not a golden hour for American statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
What amuses me is the effort of people to make a partisan issue out of it. I 
think both sides should be hanging their heads in shame at the way we have 
behaved. And I don't think the economy is in great shape. The big argument 
right now is: Are we already in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
By the most technical definition, which is two consecutive quarters in which 
the gross national product declines after adjusting for inflation, it's not yet 
possible to say we are in a recession, but that is like (asking), "How many 
angels can dance on the head of a pin?" 
</P>
<P>
I don't know anybody who thinks we are in a boom. The economy is punk. It is 
anemic. It is weak and it appears to be getting weaker. That is the reality. I 
don't have the impression it is falling over a cliff, which would suggest to me 
that the next few months are not going to be very happy ones. 
</P>
<P>
We have had for several years now a rolling recession in which it rolls from 
region to region and industry to industry. The oil belt had it, the Farm Belt, 
and the Northeast is clearly in recession. In terms of industry, the auto 
industry is in recession, the housing industry is in recession and many 
manufacturing industries are in recession. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any sound tips for the small investor? 
</P>
<P>
I think that people ought to get back to basics in terms of their finances and 
that means being a little more careful about going into debt. I think that 
people are going to discover that it is not necessarily un-American not to 
spend 120% of your income every week, and that it might be sensible to pull in 
your horns a little bit. I think that means getting back to some rules that 
make sense in tougher times. 
</P>
<P>
One set rule is not to borrow unless the thing for which you are borrowing will 
last as long as the loan. That is a very practical rule. It is all right to 
borrow to buy a house, it is all right to borrow to buy a car, as long as you 
don't take one of these new 30-year loans they are pushing. 
</P>
<P>
But it means you probably shouldn't borrow to go on vacation or to buy some 
expensive present. It may make more sense to save and then enjoy as opposed to 
the manic desire for instant gratification followed by, "Someday I will pay 
this off." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of people who maybe can think into the longer term, I still think that 
people who are small investors, who steadily accumulate quality stocks, are 
going to look smart over the next five or 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
As yuppies age and become couch potatoes themselves, they will start thinking 
about making some plans for the future and save some money. I would expect the 
nation's savings rate will go up in the '90s as a result of this population 
change. 
</P>
<P>
As the population ages, you will have relatively fewer unemployed teen-agers, 
which gives me some long-term hope in dealing with the chronic unemployment 
problems in this country; and furthermore, an older work force means a more 
experienced work force, which should mean a more productive work force which in 
itself should be good for the economy. 
</P>

O, YOSEMITE! 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I cannot believe the rage and frustration I felt as I read "Who Owns Yosemite?" 
by Maura Dolan (Sept. 30). I'm no hard-liner; I've enjoyed the conveniences 
provided by the Curry Co. over the years. 
</P>
<P>
But enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, I've watched the valley grow increasingly crowded and 
noisy. Employee vehicles roar past Yosemite Lodge, with added ruckus from 
distant garbage trucks and buses. Crowds of rowdy people often dominate 
campsites. Sure, you can hike out of the congestion, but what if you'd like to 
explore the valley floor, sit quietly by the Merced River or simply sleep in 
peace? More people in Yosemite Valley has meant an increase in pollution, crime 
and trampled meadows, and greater encroachment on animal habitats. Much of this 
so a private company could add to its multimillion-dollar profits. 
</P>
<P>
It's time, once again, to save the valley from the very people who want to 
enjoy it; and to encourage the Park Service to exert stricter control over a 
company whose recruitment efforts helped increase visitors to 3.4 million in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Let's move out the grocery stores, automobiles, swimming pools, employee 
housing and some visitor accommodations. Keep, if we must, a few restaurants, 
stores and educational programs. The Curry Co. claims its profits are actually 
below average for resorts. Yosemite is not a resort. The park is a treasure 
that can lift our hearts and spirits. But only if we can experience its natural 
wonders without the distraction of traffic, noise and overcrowding. Or else, 
why leave home?

Unhappily, Dolan's question "Who owns Yosemite?" may be answered before the 
contract renewal date in 1993. With the foregone conclusion of acquisition of 
MCA by the giant Matsushita Electric Industries Co. of Osaka, Japan, the 
control, as it now stands, of "the most scenic valley in the world," a national 
shrine and symbol of the beauty and majesty of our land, will no longer be in 
the hands of its rightful owners -- the people of America.

Maura Dolan responds: Word of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s interest in 
purchasing MCA Inc. did not surface until after the Los Angeles Times Magazine 
had gone to print with its Yosemite package. Since then, National Park Service 
director James Ridenour has told the chairman of MCA Inc. that the federal 
government would prefer to keep the Yosemite concession in American hands.

I first camped in the Valley in 1936, learned to ski at Badger Pass and spent 
many family vacations in Toulumne Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought of Yosemite as a destination resort. This MCA concept, in my 
opinion, is alien to the Yosemite I know and treasure. I agree with Ansel Adams 
about visiting "one of the greatest shrines of the world," but would one want 
motel rooms, tennis courts and swimming pools in other great shrines such as 
the Lincoln Memorial or Westminster Abbey?

I am in love with Yosemite Valley and have been since my parents introduced me 
to it in the mid-1930s. I care very much about the preservation of our great 
natural areas such as Yosemite, and I want for them the kind of management that 
will maintain them for future generations -- but offer them for the first-hand 
enjoyment of these future generations. It takes a Curry Co. to do that.

My Darling Clementine (Channel 28 Sunday at 2 p.m.) is John Ford's memorable 
1946 take on the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt 
Earp and Victor Mature as Doc Holliday.

<P>
Moonstruck (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.): One of the juiciest romantic comedies of the 
'80s, this is the film that provided Cher the Oscar-winning role that let her 
comic sensibilities out for a romp as a young widow whose dull life suddenly 
shifts 180 degrees under the spell of an extraordinarily full moon.

Lady for a Day (AMC Thursday at noon) is the 1933 Frank Capra heart-tugger 
based on a Damon Runyon story about an apple peddler (May Robson) turned into a 
lady by a gangster (Warren William) to impress the daughter who never has known 
her; Capra remade it in 1961 with Bette Davis as "A Pocketful of Miracles."

I suppose it is unavoidable that the politics-for-profit element in Washington 
contaminates even our National Park Service, but I commend The Times and author 
Dolan for the enlightening article regarding Edward Hardy's and MCA's control 
over Yosemite National Park. It makes one wonder how the National Park Service 
could relinquish their responsibility for protecting the rights and resources 
of United States citizens to a portrait-oriented corporation such as MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately there are people and organizations such as Patricia Schifferle, Joe 
Boland, Dean Malley and the Yosemite Restoration Trust who will challenge MCA's 
self-serving agenda and force the responsible government agencies to live up to 
their responsibilities.

I work in Yosemite Valley in the summer months. It is truly a glorious place. 
But these Joe Bolands really chaff my hide. 
</P>
<P>
These so-called preservationists want to preserve only their own narrow 
interests. What sort of changes do these types want? You can bet they don't 
include you enjoying this magnificent valley. 
</P>
<P>
How is it Dolan so easily found critics but was unable to find those who like 
the way things are. The history of Yosemite is written in sweat and toil by 
those who love this valley. The Yosemite Park and Curry Co. is full of people 
like this. Look a little more, and Dolan will probably find the rest of the 
crowd supports the way things are.

One is a cartoon. One is flesh and blood. But both Polly and Madeline -- the 
stars of two specials for children this week -- are lively young girls. 
</P>
<P>
You might remember Polly, played by "The Cosby Show's" Keshia Knight Pulliam, 
from last year's "Polly," a Disney musical special loosely based on Eleanor H. 
Porter's children's classic "Pollyanna." Pulliam played a girl who comes to 
live with her rich aunt (played by Phylicia Rashad, also of "Cosby") after her 
parents are killed in a car accident. The new Polly Comin' Home! continues 
where the story left off, with the 12-year-old heroine and her friends working 
to ease racial tension in her small town. In the process, Polly even helps her 
aunt rekindle a romance! The TV movie also stars Dorian Harewood and Barbara 
Montgomery of "Married People." 
</P>
<P>
"Polly Comin' Home!" Sunday at 7 p.m., NBC. For families. 
</P>
<P>
Madeline's Christmas is a new animated special based on the classic children's 
books by Ludwig Bemelmans. Here, the precocious Madeline, who lives at a 
boarding school in Paris, is the only girl in the school who isn't in bed with 
a cold. She finds herself faced with the awesome responsibility of spreading 
holiday cheer, but winds up getting help from a special visitor. Christopher 
Plummer narrates the charming tale.

By MARK FINEMAN, Mark Fineman, The Times' New Delhi bureau chief, was the first 
American newspaper correspondent allowed into Iraq after the Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
IT WAS JUST before sunset one scorching late summer day when we stumbled on a 
rare slice of the real Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
We were just off Al-Rashid Street in central Baghdad, but out of range of 
Iraq's Information Ministry guides, who have steered hundreds of reporters 
through one of the world's most highly disciplined police states since Iraq 
made itself ground zero in the Persian Gulf crisis. The conventional wisdom was 
that the real Iraq was wherever the guides were not. So on that hot September 
evening, Thomas and I were on an unescorted "reality hunt" through some of the 
narrow, dilapidated lanes in the bowels of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a young student from Germany, knew Baghdad inside and out -- in fact, 
far better than he had hoped to when he crossed the Syrian border into Iraq in 
a crowded bus on July 29 as a backpacking student of Islam and the Arabic 
language. Four days after Thomas arrived, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. A few 
days later, the United States rushed its troops, ships and planes to the gulf, 
the world isolated Iraq, which promptly sealed its borders, and 22-year-old 
Thomas suddenly found himself a prisoner in his laboratory, part of Hussein's 
human insurance policy against the prospect of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most of the other foreigners detained in Iraq, who have been free to 
go anywhere except through the immigration booth at Saddam International 
Airport, Thomas had not been idle. He was biding his time by doing exactly what 
he came to do -- study Iraq, speak its language and try to understand. He was a 
genuine guide. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that Thomas and I found ourselves on Al-Rashid Street in his 
favorite bookshop, a tiny cubicle of a place run by one of Thomas' many 
friends. It was surprising, at first, to find so many books on the shelves. 
During another reality hunt a few weeks before, at another bookstore, even the 
shop owner nervously joined in our laughter when we discovered that his House 
of Wisdom Book Store in fact had not a single volume in stock. In Saddam 
Hussein's Iraq, where censorship is written into the constitution as an 
inalienable right of the state, such apparent contradictions are common. 
</P>
<P>
But the shop owned by Thomas' friend was packed floor to ceiling with books and 
pamphlets -- Arabic-language textbooks, science, math and English texts and 
propaganda treatises issued by Hussein's all-powerful Arab Baath Socialist 
Party. One shelf was filled with dogeared and yellowing English-language 
romance novels, but they had little to do with reality even in the West. In the 
center of them all, one clue to the real Iraq stood out. 
</P>
<P>
The title was in Arabic, but there was no mistaking the large, black-and-white 
photograph on the cover. It was Adolf Hitler -- and the book was "Mein Kampf." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you surprised?" the bookshop owner asked with genuine confusion when 
he noticed my stunned expression. He had been talking with Thomas about a town 
he'd once visited in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," I said, "it's only because George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and almost 
every other Western leader have been making such a big deal out of comparing 
your president to Adolf Hitler -- you know, the guy who gasses his own people 
and tries to take over the world?" 
</P>
<P>
The shop owner smiled knowingly. He walked over to the shelf, removed the book 
with Hitler's photograph almost reverently and placed it on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"You Americans will never understand us," he said softly. " 'Mein Kampf ' is 
one of my biggest sellers. It's a brilliant work by a powerful man. Hitler was 
a strong man, and we Iraqis admire strength. He fought to rid the world of the 
Jews, and, as you know, we are still at war with Israel. But Hitler also had a 
vision for the future, and he followed that vision straight through his life. 
Hitler was a great man." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and I listened in amazement. The shop owner paused, regarding our blank 
expressions. "You in the West just don't get it. Here in Iraq, we like Hitler. 
Hitler sells." 
</P>
<P>
PENETRATING SADDAM Hussein's Iraq is like breaking into a maximum-security 
prison. Brief moments like those in the bookshop offer an outsider the hope 
that, with enough real Iraqis voicing enough real thoughts, an accurate mosaic 
of the real Iraq might emerge. But such moments are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power 11 years ago, the Iraqi leader has methodically constructed 
a monolithic order so relentlessly efficient in its promotion of strength, 
discipline and the cult of Saddamism that even Adolf Hitler would have admired 
it. Even before he engineered sole control of the presidency in 1979, Hussein, 
as second in command, laid the foundations for a three-tiered security 
apparatus that has been largely responsible for keeping him not only in power 
but alive. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Amn, the civilian state security bureau trained by the Soviet 
KGB; the Estikhbarat, the military intelligence wing that protects Iraqis and 
their interests abroad, and the Mukhabarat, the dreaded Baath intelligence 
network that is so autonomous it even spies on the other two. The Mukhabarat's 
vast web is believed to include at least one agent on every block of every 
street in every city, town and village of Iraq. For Iraqis, a wrong thought 
voiced at the wrong moment means certain imprisonment -- or death. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from institutionalized mortal fear, there's another, more complex, 
facet to this self-professed assassin's hold on his 17 million people. And to 
understand that is to appreciate the fundamental contradictions in Iraq's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Even the nation's name defies logic. Iraq is Arabic for "the well-rooted 
country." The name was given in the 7th Century to a place in roughly the spot 
Iraq now occupies. It was fairly accurate at the time. It was meant to honor 
the land known as Mesopotamia, home to the first known human civilization. But 
Iraq didn't refer to an actual country until 1932, when the British washed 
their hands of it, leaving behind a friendly monarchy and borders drawn 
deliberately to keep Iraq weak by denying it direct access to the sea. That was 
merely the final act in a centuries-long drama of war and conquest that saw the 
land invaded, splintered, annexed, spliced, splintered again and finally 
respliced in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
After the monarchy was overthrown in 1958, Iraq was wracked by revolution after 
revolution, the last of which was a bloodless coup staged by the Baath Party in 
1968. Once in power, Hussein liberated the Iraqis from their humiliating past. 
Spurred initially by a strong sense of Iraqi nationalism -- his own and his 
countrymen's -- he later capitalized on that pride to perpetuate his rule. But 
at what price? ask those familiar with the brutalities of Iraqi life. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people in a mental straitjacket," observed one diplomat who speaks 
Arabic and has lived in Baghdad for more than a year but who, like many Western 
diplomats here, remains deeply frustrated by the Iraqis' unwillingness to so 
much as invite him into their homes, let alone speak their innermost thoughts. 
"There's only one brain in this country, and he thinks for everybody. But he's 
only 36% human," the diplomat added, "so what has developed here is a truly 
self-policing society. Despite the obvious police state, people aren't really 
afraid of the knock on the door anymore because they know they've done nothing 
wrong. They've been totally conditioned. They haven't even allowed themselves 
the luxury of thinking wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqis are taught what to think, what to say and how to behave. And that 
process starts very early. 
</P>
<P>
"DOWN, DOWN, BOOSH! Down, down, Boosh!" a little voice was shouting from 
somewhere deep within the crowd of well-dressed women and children protesting 
outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's affluent Al-Mansour neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When it fell silent, another started up: "No for war! No for war!" And then 
another: "We love Saddam! We love Saddam!" 
</P>
<P>
Several American television crews pushed through the sea of placards, searching 
for the source of the voices. Finally, a helpful Information Ministry guide 
produced one of them, sorting through a thicket of legs and pulling out a 
dark-haired boy, scrawny but well-groomed. 
</P>
<P>
"His name is Naja," the guide explained. "He's 9, maybe 8, years old. And he 
speaks English. He is a very bright boy. Ask him a question. Ask him anything." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you here?" someone asked the smiling boy as the cameras rolled. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell Boosh we don't want war." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you want war?" the guide asked voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we want peace." 
</P>
<P>
"Who brought you here today?" a television reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"To tell Boosh all Iraqis want peace. To tell Boosh we want food and medicine. 
To tell Boosh we love Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know who Boosh is?" another reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly young Naja appeared to be stumped. He looked up blankly at the 
Information Ministry guide, who smiled sheepishly at the journalists and then 
turned sternly back to the boy, whispering in Arabic, "Boosh is president of 
America. Tell them." 
</P>
<P>
With renewed confidence, Naja almost bellowed, "Boosh is president of America. 
He takes away our milk. He takes away our medicine. No for war! No for war!" 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was an orchestrated event, listed that morning as "Iraqi 
Children Protest at U. S. Embassy" on the marquee beside the Information 
Ministry's permanent desk in the lobby of the Ishtar Sheraton. The Sheraton is 
one of several luxury hotels that have been home to foreign journalists who, as 
the number of foreign diplomats dwindles, have served as the world's eyes and 
ears inside Iraq since the gulf crisis erupted. That evening, virtually every 
international television network covering the morning protest included footage 
of the event in its gulf roundup. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you really hate America?" a few of us asked one of the protesting mothers 
during one of the rare, brief moments when the guides were out of earshot. 
</P>
<P>
"America? America good. Very good," she said, as her children shouted 
anti-American slogans. "We like America. Just Boosh. Boosh no good." 
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD BAATHIST runs quickly and well through a mine field; your weapon 
against the mines is your education," Hussein once told his comrades at a party 
meeting. "You will be able to defuse the bombs if you are equipped with the 
principles of your party and with education." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power, Hussein's ministries of education and information have 
rewritten most textbooks to reflect not only the Baath Party's ideological 
underpinnings but also Hussein's own vision: The map is wrong, borders do not 
exist, the Arab nations should be one country with one leader. The clear 
implication is that Hussein would take charge. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of school this year -- two months after the mid-summer 
conquest of Kuwait -- children in every geography class in every city, village 
and town of Iraq found themselves drawing new maps of their nation that 
included a province once known as the nation of Kuwait. In history class, too, 
the lessons were changed. The new party line went like this: Kuwait is and 
always had been a part of Iraq. There never really was a country called Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Baghdad's largest mosque one Friday as the imam bellowed the holy day's 
sermon through the minaret's loudspeakers, a friend and I came across a young 
soft-drink vendor in a ragged T-shirt. His stock included cans of Coca-Cola 
marked "Made in Kuwait" and priced in Kuwaiti currency, plundered goods that, 
along with food smuggled from Turkey and Iran, have helped Iraq so far 
withstand the United Nations embargo imposed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The boy looked deeply puzzled when we asked, "Wasn't this part of all the stuff 
that Iraq looted from Kuwait?" 
</P>
<P>
"Looted?" the boy asked, nonplussed. "We own Kuwait. Kuwait is a part of Iraq. 
This is Iraqi Coke." 
</P>
<P>
But while rewriting the history and geography of the world illustrates the 
broad reach of Hussein's indoctrination, it also highlights Iraq's deep-seated 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Young Naja, for instance, knew the right word to use for the American 
president. Boosh,as Iraqi government newscasters deliberately pronounce 
President Bush's name hundreds of times a day in radio and television 
broadcasts, is actually the Arabic word for "nothing" or, in its more 
derogatory meaning on Baghdad streets, "an empty hole." But clearly, Naja 
didn't associate the name with the American President himself. When later asked 
to name the U. S. President, Naja again shrugged his shoulders and looked 
around for the Information Ministry guide. 
</P>
<P>
It was a telling moment, according to the diplomats remaining in town. "Sounds 
to me like that boy and Saddam Hussein have a lot in common," one said when he 
heard about Naja. "I'm sure Saddam knows George Bush's name, but he probably 
doesn't know a whole lot more about him that that. And this is the crux of the 
whole problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has become so isolated under Saddam Hussein that the Iraqi people no 
longer have a real understanding of what the outside world is all about. And 
that applies to Saddam Hussein, as well -- especially to him." 
</P>
<P>
THE SCREEN ON the large television set inside the U. S. Embassy went blank for 
a moment, then the familiar logo appeared at the top of the picture: "Guest 
News," it declared. Quickly, the handful of embassy diplomats and the six U. S. 
Marines who still remained in Baghdad gathered around to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Since the gulf crisis began, "Guest News" has been a nightly feature on 
state-run Iraqi Television. Officials in the Information Ministry describe it 
as a humanitarian show that gives Saddam Hussein's "special guests" -- the 
hostages held under strict military guard at strategic targets throughout the 
country -- an opportunity to send video messages to family and friends in the 
outside world. But this night was different. Tonight, Hussein was the star of 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a fine gray suit and tie, the Iraqi president appeared in a modern, 
cavernous conference room ringed by about two dozen hostages from the United 
States, Britain and France -- the people he believes are guarding his nation 
against a U. S. air strike. It was Hussein's second "Rocky Horror Hostage 
Show," as one person in the U. S. Embassy's TV room dubbed it. Two weeks 
before, during a worldwide broadcast, he had ignited an international furor by 
hugging and patting on the head a young British boy named Stuart Lockwood. And 
here was Hussein again, patting young girls on the cheek and running his hands 
through their hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh! Christ Almighty!" shouted one of the Marines watching that night as he 
fell to the floor, sprawled flat on his back with his arms outstretched toward 
the sky. "C'mon, you guys. Here it is. Ground zero. Drop the nuke on my 
coordinates." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein went on with his 90-minute show, devoting an hour to a speech that 
included what aides later said the Iraqi president considered to be a heartfelt 
apology to the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"From a human point of view, I am in as much pain as you are," he told them in 
Arabic. "Let me say how painful for me it is to see a situation come about that 
has put you where you are now. I wish that your stay in a manner of forced 
hospitality, let us say, will not be long." (Access to the strategic sites was 
prohibited, however, so no one knew then how detainees were being treated. It 
was only after some French hostages were freed in October that harsh conditions 
-- some Americans were said to be near the breaking point -- were reported.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, an extraordinary thing happened. Hussein admitted how little he 
understood about his "guests" -- and their politicians and nations. He 
announced that he was utterly confounded by the outrage in the West after his 
previous hostage show. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that they were annoyed with me," Hussein said. "I don't see why they 
should be annoyed." And then, he added his own interpretation of that 
"annoyance" -- a classic illustration of how Hussein's personal alienation from 
the West has layered misunderstanding upon misunderstanding in the last 3 1/2 
months. "It seems to me these officials were annoyed with my meeting with the 
British people because they don't want the facts to be told, except through 
them and on their own channels. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the Marines announced with a string of unprintable curses that they 
wanted to switch Hussein's channel off, then left to have a few beers. 
</P>
<P>
SADDAM-WATCHING, as it has been called by some in Iraq, was the favorite and 
most perplexing pursuit of the diplomatic corps in Baghdad. Critical clues in 
the reality hunt, the diplomats' perceptions have helped to form not only U. S. 
policy in the gulf crisis but also the images of Iraq appearing in the tens of 
thousands of column inches of newspaper reports that have been published and 
the hundreds of hours of American television coverage that have aired since 
Aug. 2. Where the diplomats -- a mixed bag of Arabists and career bureaucrats 
from virtually every nation of the world -- were free to speculate, the Iraqis 
were afraid to think. 
</P>
<P>
But in the diplomats' necessarily prismatic view, there was only one facet of 
Hussein's character on which all of them seemed to agree. It is that this 
strong-willed, ironfisted man, who has stamped his own image on an entire 
nation in just over a decade, has gleaned virtually all of his knowledge of the 
Western world from books and advisers. With the exception of a single trip to 
France years ago, Hussein, 53, is believed to have never set foot outside the 
Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really visited the West, and, you know, Hitler, too, never visited 
the outside world," a German diplomat said. "With Saddam, it's the same as 
Ceaucescu or Hitler. No one is telling him the real information." Which, he 
added, relates directly to Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Saddam miscalculated the whole thing because his picture of the 
world is a little bit different from reality," the diplomat continued. "Before 
the invasion, he got the information filtered. And so, since he had no frame of 
reference of his own on how the West would react, he went ahead with it. It was 
a mistake, and I think he realizes it was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think he's brilliant," said another diplomat in another embassy. "He's 
a brilliant strategist -- very good at keeping his opponents off guard. As much 
as he is in a corner, he has placed the rest of the world in a corner as well." 
</P>
<P>
But then, that same diplomat quickly caught himself. He was born and raised in 
a democratic Western nation where men like Hitler and Hussein don't play too 
well. "Look, I would hate to say anything good about Saddam. He's a vicious 
man. He's frighteningly brutal. He would happily sacrifice half his people to 
take on the rest of the world. He has gassed his own people. He has sent 
everybody's sons to war. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that when you live here long enough, you begin to understand and 
appreciate not only the perspective of Saddam but of the millions of people who 
still do support him here. People should not distinguish too much between the 
way Saddam Hussein does things and the way the Iraqis do things. There simply 
isn't that much difference." 
</P>
<P>
"BASTARD!" SCREAMED my taxi driver after a battered, white-and-yellow taxi cut 
him off in heavy traffic. "Do it again and I'll tear your heart out!" he 
shouted out the window as we sped down a palm-lined boulevard, dodging the 
potholes that have multiplied as sanctions have begun to wear down Baghdad's 
once-efficient infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks later, the same taxi driver deliberately swerved into our path. 
</P>
<P>
"One more time, and I'll smash your bones to dust!" my driver yelled, this time 
with so much force that I thought he would crush the steering wheel instead. 
</P>
<P>
The other taxi driver flipped his hand at us as if he was swatting a fly, and, 
sure enough, a few minutes later, he cut us off again. My driver had been 
nothing but sweet and soft-spoken all day, but now his kindly face twisted into 
something that resembled a rubber Halloween mask. His fingers gripped the wheel 
like metal vises, and he pushed his right foot to the floor with his entire 
body behind it. The car lurched forward. We careened down the road, and my 
driver didn't stop until we sideswiped the taxi, forcing it onto the sidewalk 
and into a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, the madness drained from my driver's face. Then he leaned out 
the window in the direction of the other driver, who was busy looking for his 
door, and said, "Sorry, but I warned you." 
</P>
<P>
This incident, similar to accidents that occur frequently on the crowded 
thoroughfares of Baghdad, provided an almost too-perfect metaphor. A few days 
afterward, I found myself chatting with the same diplomat who had called 
Hussein brilliant. "It's like I said," he told me this time. "The Iraqi style 
is they warn you, they warn you again, they might even warn you again, and then 
they hit you -- hard." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat shared the same perspective of 
Kuwait-invasion-as-traffic-accident: "The last thing you want to do in this 
situation is what that taxi driver did. Don't provoke, and don't push Saddam 
into a corner. The worst kind of situation is the one that exists here today -- 
where no one's willing to talk to Saddam. Push him too far, and he's the kind 
of guy who'll opt for driving you off the road. And, in this case, I'm afraid 
that's Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it may seem that these particular diplomats had been in Baghdad 
too long. But their theory was validated by the Iraqis themselves. 
</P>
<P>
NAJI AL-HADITHI'S spacious corner office on the eighth floor of Iraq's Ministry 
of Information and Culture is an oasis of Western sophistication in the heart 
of Baghdad -- at least on the surface. There are photocopiers, a fax machine, 
half a dozen telephones, an intercom system, a wide-screen television set and 
well-equipped kitchen for the many late nights that Iraq's director general of 
information and culture has spent here. 
</P>
<P>
The office has served as Al-Hadithi's command post since early August, when 
fears of all-out war gave way to a military stalemate in which image and 
information were the only effective weapons. Al-Hadithi, who was Iraq's senior 
press attache in London during the mid-'70s and who edits the Baghdad Observer, 
Iraq's only English-language newspaper, had all the makings of a brilliant 
field general for this battle. He was among the few senior Iraqi officials with 
an intimate understanding of the Western media, and he was fiercely loyal to 
the Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside Al-Hadithi's office, the superficial trappings of the West melt 
away into a strange and separate reality. It begins with small details, such as 
the paperweight beside the imported TV. It was one of those glass bubbles 
similar to the ones with snow that swirls when you shake them. But inside 
Al-Hadithi's paperweight, there was only reddish sand, with a small Iraqi flag 
planted in the center. The inscription read, "The earth of Al Faw mixed with 
the blood of Iraqi martyrs" -- a commemoration of the battles for the strategic 
Iraqi city in which at least 52,000 Iraqis and as many as 100,000 Iranians died 
during the 1980-1988 war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to tell the world that we are powerful and that we can destroy all the 
allied forces that are here," Al-Hadithi explained. "This should be made clear 
to everybody to give people second thoughts about attacking Iraq. They have a 
goal. Their goal is to end something called Iraq. And we have a goal -- to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
With his genteel style and American idioms, Al-Hadithi has the uncanny ability 
to describe the Iraqi position in a way Westerners can understand. "You have to 
look at Iraq in 1968 to understand all this," Al-Hadithi said, explaining the 
invasion and Iraq's Orwellian overtones. "Until the (Baathist) revolution that 
year, there had been a serious contradiction in this country -- a rich country 
with a great potential for oil, a great potential for agriculture, a great 
potential for development. But, with all this, in 1968, if you tell somebody 
you are from Iraq, they think only of Iran. You say Iraq, he knows only 
something about the Arabian Nights. You say Baghdad, and he thinks only of 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
"The country was in a lousy state. It was ruled by foreign embassies with spies 
everywhere. And the Iraqis had no place on the map. Saddam Hussein was able to 
shift Iraq from that state of backwardness to the state it is in now, where 
George Bush can say Iraq has the fourth-largest military in the world. Saddam 
Hussein aroused the pride in every Iraqi who was humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
Asked at one point during the crisis whether the Iraqis were concerned about 
the prospect of war, Al-Hadithi made a subtle but, he said, crucial distinction 
between the words worry and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"The most powerful man in the world doesn't want to be hurt or killed," he 
explained. "He has to be worried so that he prepares himself to defeat you. We 
have to be worried, of course. The only one who is not worried about war is the 
one who is not interested in life. But are we afraid of war? No. After eight 
years, we know what is war. Unlike the Americans, you see, sacrifice is a way 
of life in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
That resilience in a nation already drained by war may explain why sanctions 
have not been as effective as the United States had hoped. Foreign trade has 
all but ceased, and Hussein's modern state has shown signs of crumbling, with 
power outages and shortages of industrial goods. However, most food staples 
have remained plentiful, thanks to rationing and supplies from Kuwait. And a 
popular uprising is unlikely, no matter how dire things get. 
</P>
<P>
Most Iraqis seem happy to blame Kuwait for their misery. In their view, the 
gravity wells the Kuwaitis used to pump oil out of the Rumaila field, which 
straddles the Iraqi border, were stealing millions of barrels of Iraq's only 
marketable resource. The Kuwaitis, Iraqis insisted, were deliberately glutting 
the world's oil market to keep gasoline prices down in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Iraqis considered Kuwait's emir and his ruling Al-Sabah family 
corrupt, arrogant spendthrifts who deserted their tiny, 27-year-old gulf state 
every summer to gamble in Monte Carlo or loll on the French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares about the Sabah family?" remarked a smiling, almost gleeful, Hicham 
Abdul Alim, a pharmacist approached at random in a Baghdad market. "These are 
people gone with the wind." 
</P>
<P>
FOR DECADES,a bronze statue of an anonymous Arab warrior on horseback stood in 
the Square of the Arab Knight, near the center of Baghdad. Soon after the 
invasion of Kuwait, however, government workmen removed the monument. A few 
days later, they erected a new, 3 1/2-story-high bronze likeness of Saddam 
Hussein, his right arm outstretched toward Saudi Arabia, Iraq's newest enemy 
and temporary home of the U. S. troops massed in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of Stalinesque statues and posters of Hussein in Baghdad, 
but none as large as the Arab Knight. And, in the days that followed the 
statue's installation, Hussein's party agents supposedly went throughout the 
city, looking for cafes, shops or hotels that bore the common Arabic name, "The 
Arab Knight." When they found one, they ordered the owner to remove his sign 
and change the name, adding simply, "There is now only one Arab Knight in 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Near the square one evening, I approached an elderly date seller as he made his 
way home. He seemed fearful at first, but when asked his opinion of the new 
statuary, he relaxed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good, very good," he said with a largely toothless grin. "It shows the 
world how big we Iraqis are now." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that the statue is not of just any Iraqi, but of their one and only 
ruler, the old man seemed offended. 
</P>
<P>
"He is our president, that is true," the date seller said, turning toward the 
statue. "But he is an Iraqi, too. And look how tall and how strong he is. This 
makes us very happy because Saddam's strength is our strength. And never before 
have we Iraqis been as strong as we are now. Look, even you Americans are 
afraid of us now."

<P>
IN SUMMER, the rolling hills outside Charlottesville, Va., take on the deep 
green hue of new money, a convenient reminder of who owns them. Nature imitates 
net worth in this part of the country, and historic estates have names that 
sound like they're expensive brands of bourbon, such as Ash Lawn, Willow Brook 
and Tall Oaks. Charlottesville is in Albemarle County, which is reputed to be 
the home of more millionaires per square mile than any other part of the United 
States, including media mogul John Kluge, the richest man in America. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a new millionaire in the neighborhood -- Kluge's ex-wife. With her 
nine-year marriage to the man with a net worth of $5.6 billion all but 
officially over, Patricia Kluge, 41, is reportedly receiving one of the largest 
divorce settlements in American history. The exact amount has not been 
disclosed, and some sources put it at a mere $1 million a year. But the more 
generally reported amount is the annual interest on $1 billion worth of 
investments and property for life, meted out in $1.6 million-a-week 
installments. 
</P>
<P>
She also got the 45-room house, Albemarle Farm; John has moved into a separate 
home on the estate's 10,000-acre spread. From a distance, Albemarle Farm looks 
like a neo-Georgian theme park painted against the Blue Ridge Mountains. At one 
end of the vast expanse of front acreage, workers are busy laying sod and 
harvesting alfalfa. At the other end, swans are floating peacefully in a 
mock-English country lake. Below the brick mansion, completed just two years 
ago, a foursome of off-duty farm hands plays golf. Hedges are trimmed with 
geometric precision, roads wind around trees in perfect curves, and everywhere 
new concrete belies the ye-olde aspirations of the overall design. 
</P>
<P>
It is ostentatious even by the standards of this upper-class pocket of tweed 
120 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. Charlottesville, a quaint university 
town that has dual devotions to scholarly learning and movie deals, has been 
called an 18th-Century Malibu. Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange are the Kluges' 
nearest neighbors. Muhammad Ali, Martina Navratilova and writer Ann Beattie 
aren't far away. Sissy Spacek moved in a few years ago. Steven Soderbergh, 
director of "sex, lies and videotape," arrived last year. 
</P>
<P>
Charlottesville is rustic, rich and rife with rumors, most of which concern 
Patricia Kluge, the town's most talked-about resident celebrity since Thomas 
Jefferson. Everyone wants to know what the future holds for the woman who, at 
32, with an already titillating past, married a man 33 years older and six 
inches shorter than she. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the divorce at a recent gala AIDS benefit in Washington, Kluge 
demurred. "I don't know if it would be appropriate now," she said, fingering a 
strand of grape-sized pearls. "I just don't know if I should," she added in a 
voice that indicated her lawyers would be upset if she talked to a reporter 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the whispering these days is about Kluge's relationship with 
Virginia's bachelor governor, L. Douglas Wilder. In 1989, the Kluges 
contributed $200,000 to Wilder's campaign and raised $500,000 more from 
friends. After Wilder took office, he named Patricia, a high school dropout, to 
the University of Virginia's board of visitors. In March, a month before her 
separation became public, she accompanied Wilder to Los Angeles, where they 
promoted the Virginia Festival of American Film. Since then, stories abound 
that she and America's first elected black governor are having a romance. On at 
least one occasion, Wilder used a state helicopter to visit her in 
Charlottesville. There are rumors about their trips to Nantucket, the eastern 
shore of Virginia and other vacation spots, but both claim that their 
relationship is purely political. "We're friends, only friends," says Wilder, 
who increasingly is being discussed as national-ticket material. 
</P>
<P>
Charlottesville has always been more Patricia Kluge's town than her husband's. 
After all, it was her semi-sordid past that brought the couple here in the 
first place. In late 1985, just as the Kluges were about to host a Palm Beach 
bash for Prince Charles and Princess Diana, British gossip columnist Nigel 
Dempster revealed that Kluge had been a sex-advice columnist and had done 
full-frontal poses for Knave, a British skin magazine. The Kluges, married for 
four years at the time, canceled the party and moved to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Her critics, of whom there are many, suggest that she courts Charlottesville's 
Hollywood crowd only because she got the cold shoulder from British royalty. 
She has a different explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great regard for films," says the woman who appeared in "The Nine 
Ages of Nakedness," an English soft-core flick, 20 years ago. She really cares 
about "films as art," she says, cares so much that three years ago, she started 
the Virginia film festival, which has brought the likes of Nick Nolte, David 
Brown and John Sayles to her mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The first year, "The Good Mother," with Diane Keaton, premiered in 
Charlottesville, and Nolte and other notables, including Norman Mailer, were 
flown by helicopter to Albemarle Farm for a private party, starring Patricia 
Kluge. Last year, "Old Gringo" was unveiled, with Gregory Peck in attendance. 
And in honor of the 50th anniversary of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," James 
Stewart showed up. 
</P>
<P>
This October, the event, co-sponsored by the University of Virginia, lasted a 
week, though the stars were a little dimmer. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. introduced 
one of his father's films, and Louis Gossett Jr., who had just finished filming 
"Toy Soldiers" at Albemarle County's Miller School, joined Bugs Bunny on the 
speaker's platform. 
</P>
<P>
"It's here," Kluge says of the festival, "because I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her enthusiasm for the festival and other parties and benefits she's 
begun attending on the arms of various walkers, many who know Kluge say that 
it's been an extremely difficult period for her. Just days before a gala 
post-separation debut this summer, she plowed her Range Rover into a ditch 
while trying to avoid running over a small animal. Police charged her with 
reckless driving, and some of her friends say that the strain of losing her 
identity as the wife of a rich and powerful man might be taking its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just Pat Kluge now," says a Washington socialite. "It will be 
interesting to see what she does with herself." 
</P>
<P>
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE is in her office, and, according to a maid, will be 
"available" in 10 minutes. Eventually, the maid leads the way upstairs, where 
Kluge, in a boatnecked top and white slacks and looking years younger than she 
did when the divorce was announced, stands in the doorway. On her desk is a 
stack of college catalogues that she has to read for a meeting at the 
university. In a corner is a basket filled with children's toys and a paper 
shredder that appears to have recently destroyed a number of documents. On top 
of a wooden cabinet are pictures of Kluge's 7-year old son, John Jr., with his 
father; of her prize-winning team of carriage horses, and of Douglas Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge says that she works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day; she talks to her 
financial advisers, reads university reports and goes through the dozens of 
party invitations and requests for charitable contributions that she receives 
every week. She also spends "a major amount of time" overseeing the 
construction of an immense classical garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be absolutely wonderful when it's finished," she says in a slow, sexy 
Middle Eastern accent. The highest point in the garden will be crowned with a 
statue dedicated to the Native Americans "who used to live here," she declares. 
"Or I might do something else," she adds. "I haven't decided yet." 
</P>
<P>
These days, deciding what to do has become a full-time occupation for Kluge, 
whose life has suddenly become the subject of intense curiosity in England and 
America. "I have no idea why people are so interested in me," she says, looking 
and sounding puzzled. "I'm always myself wherever I am. My soul is Eastern, my 
character is British, my spirit is American. I was born in Iraq and lived in 
England, and now I'm here, and this is where I'll die and be buried." 
</P>
<P>
Her crypt is indeed on the mansion's grounds. And by the time she fills it, her 
wealth may rival her ex-husband's. But that's something, she says, that doesn't 
concern her. "I won't become wealthy," she corrects. "I am wealthy. Money, to 
me, is just there. I never think of it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Even as a child, she knew that someday she'd command a fortune. It wasn't luck 
or planning that got her to where she is today, she says; it was destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"You do believe in karma, don't you?" she asks. "I envisioned all this a long 
time ago. Yes. Absolutely. I never thought I'd do anything else. I never had 
any doubt that I was going to be a great lady and do what I wanted to do. Not 
for a minute. If the revolution in Iraq hadn't come about, I would probably 
have stayed there, been married to someone successful, and doing exactly the 
same things I'm doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, who likes to call herself a rebel, says she feels no need to justify 
herself to anyone. She's aware of the "bad things" that have been written about 
her but claims that she never reads them. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing about being wealthy is that you are judged as a heartless, 
cold, uncaring opportunist," she says. "That's because people are frightened of 
money. They think that anyone who has it is going to buy his way into 
everything, buy everyone's soul. It's unsettling to a lot of people when one 
does things so well and with great speed." 
</P>
<P>
BORN PATRICIA Rose in Baghdad, Iraq, Kluge grew up thinking she already had the 
best of everything. Even though her British father was merely a translator of 
legal texts, the family could afford private schools, country clubs and 
servants. In 1965, after the revolution had ended their good life, Kluge's 
parents divorced, and Patricia and her brother, Ernest, went to live with their 
half-Scottish, half-Iraqi mother in London. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly she was in a country with supermarkets and movie theaters, where men 
and women could be in the same room together without breaking the law. "I felt 
like I had come from the 10th Century," Kluge says. She remembers the 
unpleasant side of her new life. Not only was she forced to live in "a tiny 
London flat as opposed to a grand house with gardens and staff, " but she also 
had to work. Seeing how quickly forces beyond her control could turn good 
fortune to bad, she vowed that "whatever happens to me in my life, I will 
always depend on me." She enrolled in a secretarial school but stayed less than 
a day. "I walked into that class and saw the pale, sallow faces, and I thought, 
'I am not like them, nor will I ever be like them,"' she recalls. "So I walked 
out and never walked back again." 
</P>
<P>
She was a receptionist at Heathrow Airport, then a hat-check girl at a Turkish 
supper club in London. One evening the regular belly dancer was sick, so she 
filled in. Her performance so impressed Russell Gay, the publisher of Knave, 
that he offered her a modeling job on the spot. Soon she was showing up in the 
pages of his magazine, writing an advice column on sex and appearing in a 
soft-porn movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gay, Kluge says, was the first man who ever told her "how incredibly attractive 
I was." In 1969, at the age of 19, she married him. He was 50. It was very 
exciting, says Kluge, looking back on her modeling career and the five years as 
Gay's "child bride." But, she says, the person she was then no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
After her divorce, she moved in with Kenneth Newton, a London society 
psychiatrist who also was 30 years her senior. The relationship lasted until 
1976, when she came to America to look into a movie deal and met the man who 
would change her life. According to Forbes, John Kluge is currently the richest 
man in the United States. When he met Patricia, his holdings included a slew of 
radio and television stations, the Ice Capades and the Harlem Globetrotters. He 
since has sold pieces of his Metromedia network, but he's still got 70% of 
Orion Pictures, three steakhouse chains, a cellular telephone franchise and a 
telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge came to the United States from Germany when he was 8. He was saved from a 
butcher's apprenticeship in Detroit when he won a scholarship to Columbia 
University. As a student, he amassed his first bankroll -- $7,000 -- by playing 
poker and selling stationery and shoes, and went on to become a brilliant 
entrepeneur. 
</P>
<P>
He had been married and divorced twice before he was swept off his feet by 
Patricia Rose at a New York charity ball in 1976. As the May-December romance 
blossomed -- he was 60, she 27 -- he spent millions on her care and upkeep. 
First came expensive jewelry; and then, after a huge wedding in New York in 
1981, limos, planes and yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Love seemed to transform the much-feared Kluge into an automatic cash machine 
for his wife, whose extravagance was making headlines around the world, many of 
them implying that she was the quintessential gold-digger. Then her X-rated 
past came to light. The scandal was, Patricia Kluge says, a test of their 
marriage and of her personal courage. "You have to be secure in yourself to 
come out of a thing like that well," she says. 
</P>
<P>
PERHAPS BECAUSE of her girlhood, Kluge immediately took to Charlottesville, 
with its antique charm and quiet respect for tradition. Albemarle Farm, of 
which Kluge proudly states, "I created," became for her a miniature England 
where she entertained everyone from King Juan Carlos of Spain to Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
Within her realm, Kluge literally took over everything; she rearranged the 
landscape and the lives of all the creatures in it. She built five lakes, an 
Arnold Palmer-designed golf course, and a barn so ornate and spotless that the 
animals are kept on diets formulated to control their defecation. "It doesn't 
even smell like a barn," a neighbor says. "Why can't she just let her horses be 
horses? It's so unnatural." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the proper English game preserve, an 800-acre private firing 
range where the Kluges and their friends, under the watchful eye of Irish 
gamekeeper Sir Richard Musgrave, blasted away at imported pheasants and quails. 
In their haste to keep natural predators from spoiling the fun, Musgrave and 
his assistants killed hundreds of hawks on the government's endangered species 
list. When a mass grave containing the birds and several neighborhood dogs was 
found in the spring of 1988, Musgrave and his helpers were arrested and put on 
trial. They were deported and the Kluges, who said they didn't know "how this 
horror happened," paid a $120,000 fine -- $1,000 for each dead bird. 
</P>
<P>
To relieve her sadness over the affair, Kluge told a Charlottesville paper, she 
planned to make more frequent visits to the family's chapel, a place she often 
goes to in times of trouble. After Kluge's marriage to John, religion 
reportedly came to play a large part in her country lifestyle. John Kluge, 
whose trips to church are said to be less and less frequent, remains a 
pragmatic businessman. 
</P>
<P>
"John's life is his work," Kluge says. "I think with giants like him that's 
always the case. He's like a great general who can't go back to being emperor. 
He's got to win that one last medal." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like veiled criticism but it's really high praise. "John will 
always be my husband," Kluge says, her eyes appearing to glisten slightly in 
the afternoon sunlight. "I love him dearly. It's a shame that this had to 
happen, but it was just one of those things -- two people drifting apart." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge won't say what caused their marriage to break up, other than the fact 
that "John wasn't here enough." If the affection between them is still as 
strong as she suggests, is there any chance of a reconciliation? "I don't think 
we would have gone this far," she replies, sadly stroking her short hair. "This 
is not a game. But what is important is our friendship. That means far more 
than living together. I love him very much." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone finds the break-up sad, or surprising. "This was a relationship 
that was doomed from the start," says a Washington society columnist. "Everyone 
who knew John at the time he got married saw Patricia as an opportunist." 
</P>
<P>
Kluge says that she doesn't care what people say about her. "John and I don't 
live for other people's opinion," she explains. "People can think what they 
want. Only we know what's important to us." 
</P>
<P>
The English press has long portrayed Kluge as a social-climbing bimbo who's 
been trying to buy an audience with the queen for years. Nigel Dempster, the 
Daily Mail gossip columnist who broke the news of Kluge's modeling career, "has 
been on Patricia's case for years," says Jennifer Hirshberg, a former press 
secretary to Nancy Reagan who occasionally works in the same capacity for 
Kluge. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there's a sickness in England," Kluge says. "There's a great envy of 
Americans there. Americans can create greater wealth in one generation than 
families there can accumulate in centuries. The British invented the gutter 
press, and it's worse than ever. They pick on the fact that I'm a woman and 
that I've become so rich. They absolutely hate it. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to be a reasonable person who cares about the world, who's loved by 
her friends and who seems to do all the right things. So I suppose they feel 
the need to destroy a success story like that." 
</P>
<P>
TO KLUGE, who became an American citizen two years ago, it's all very 
upsetting, especially now that she's trying to establish her identity as a 
working woman. The announcement of her appointment to the University of 
Virginia's board of visitors, a position that governors traditionally have 
reserved for their big campaign contributors, was greeted with a certain amount 
of derision in Virginia's political circles. "I'll be damned," a crusty old 
state legislator reportedly said when he heard the news. "Wilder nominated that 
porn queen." Some people tried to block her from the job, declaring her unfit 
for the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I called Gov. Wilder right after the announcement," Kluge told a local 
reporter when some students protested the move. "I said, 'Are you sure you want 
to do this?' And he said, 'Absolutely. You'll make a great contribution.' And 
that was the end of the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
As for the suspicion that the Kluges' $200,000 donation to Wilder's political 
campaign had something to do with her new job, Kluge is adamant. "Douglas 
Wilder is his own man," she says. "I think it's an awful thing to say that one 
contributes to a man who will lead the state for the next four years for the 
reason of an appointment to the university. I certainly don't need to be 
appointed to anything to feel great or important." 
</P>
<P>
She blames her lack of a high school diploma on "family circumstances" and the 
revolution in Iraq. But she wants to stress that she had "a very sophisticated 
upbringing, a very cultured one." 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Kluge has been a willing participant in the meetings, " says Bill 
Fishback, a university spokesman. "She's a real team player." 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, she can't help being Patricia Kluge. When she first heard 
that the board meetings were open to the public, she commented, "How very 
democratic." Nevertheless, she regularly arrives with several bodyguards. Once, 
as her security people waited in the hallway, she briefly left a meeting to 
visit the ladies' room. Her bodyguards noticed that she was missing, and 
according to one account, "all hell broke loose." The commotion subsided, but 
not before everyone realized that Patricia Kluge requires special attention. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a quarter century of close relationships with three much older 
men, is Kluge ready for life on her own? Right now, she's preparing for the 
rigors of being a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge's son is coming home from a day of playing with friends. He's dressed in 
shorts and a neon-pink baseball hat. His mother begins to fuss over him in a 
way that makes most little boys uncomfortable. "Say hello, darling," she tells 
him. John Jr. only squirms to get away. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to bond with him. It's a very important time for us," Kluge says, 
observing that her son is showing signs of becoming just like his father. "The 
other day he came into my bedroom and said, 'Mummy, I need $100 for Wall 
Street.' Can you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he wanted the money to buy baseball cards. But, Kluge proudly 
reports, he's already thinking of deals. "He's very amusing when he starts to 
reason who I should marry," she says. "I said to him, 'Darling, we have such 
adventures to look forward to in life,' and he said, 'Yes, Mummy, and a new 
poppy coming to live with us, too. You'd better look good!' He's been my 
absolute strength through this." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kluge needs time, she says, to consider her options -- in love as well 
as business. She stands in her driveway, gazing out over the vast stretches of 
green farmland in the valley below. The sun is setting, and the fields in the 
distance are a brilliant gold. Yes, she admits, she'd like to share this with 
someone, but it would have to be someone who's strong, purposeful and brave 
enough to endure the same painful things she's been through. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to marry a wealthy man now," she says. Then again, she recognizes 
that being one of the richest women in the world does have certain built-in 
romantic risks. There will be men, perhaps many, who'll only be interested in 
getting their hands on her fortune.

"It will be something to look out for," she sighs, as she brushes her hair back 
against the wind.

TEMPLES OF LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The art of Joseph Shuldiner proves that sometimes the best form does follow 
function. He created his first translucent lighting sculptures when he needed 
lamps himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I had moved into a house where there were no fixtures, so I took one of my 
sculptures and stuck a bulb in it." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the sculptures are reminiscent of world-renowned Isamu 
Noguchi's paper lights. But Shuldiner credits other inspirational sources as 
well, namely the 1919 silent film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." "I've been 
inspired ever since by bizarre angles," he says; "Caligari" is the name of his 
newest lamp. Shuldiner uses rice paper and willow branches, indigenous to the 
area, to create his sculptures in his Los Angeles studio. Each takes a day to 
assemble, and his father -- a retired sheet-metal worker who never thought of 
himself as an artist -- helps devise the hardware that holds the bulbs. "A 
small piece of sculpture in itself," Shuldiner says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
When his graceful fixtures stand side-by-side, they resemble a glimmering, 
surreal city skyline. "My work is about the juxtaposition of the organic and 
industrial," Shuldiner explains, "a modern metropolis realized in primitive, 
organic materials." 
</P>
<P>
The sculptures are so popular that Shuldiner is still in the same predicament 
as when he began. "Right now," he says," I don't have any lamps in my own 
house: Somehow I always end up selling them." BARBARA THORNBURG

BALZER ON WINE: TIME FOR WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN a hard sell in the United States because it has not been 
understood as a natural companion for food -- part of a healthful regimen. The 
autumn harvest of 1990 arrived under threatening clouds of "sin tax" ballot 
measures and federal legislation threatening the very existence of grape 
growing and winemaking in the state. Yet, it is always time for wine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to put the glass or bottle of wine on the table, right there with 
the hamburgers, pizzas and tacos," says Sheldon (Hack) Wilson, owner /vintner 
of Chimney Rock in the Napa Valley. "What we need," he says, "is a definition 
that comes as easy as Coke's 'Pause that refreshes,' which tells the story 
without any insinuating stuffy rigmarole." 
</P>
<P>
There was a challenge. We left it with his suggestion: "It's always time for 
wine . . . the civilized refreshment." 
</P>
<P>
While I was in the Napa Valley, I also stopped at Monticello Cellars, where the 
Napa Valley Vintners Assn. was having its annual Crush Celebration. Guest 
harvesters from all over came to pick grapes and assist in the crush and 
fermentation (while wearing rubber boots), alongside all the regulars. There 
were tales to tell and good laughs. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, I flew to Switzerland to observe the harvest in the Canton of 
Vaud, which fronts Lac Leman of Geneva, home of the vine since Roman times. The 
harvest was in full swing. As in the Napa Valley, laughter, songs and shouts of 
merriment were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss wine growers promote the ubiquitous golden Chasselas grape as having a 
very subtle flavor . . . and taking character from the different soils in which 
it is grown. True. I tasted dozens of wines of Chasselas origins from the 
separate appellations. None were the same. Some were earth-earthy, some had 
subtle aromas, and others defied description. But all were delicate, with an 
appetizing dryness. 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, as in other parts of Europe, wine is part of the food regimen 
and is consumed regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Back in America, with Thanksgiving days away, it's almost redundant to say, 
"It's time for wine!" But it is time, now, at Thanksgiving and whenever. "It's 
always time for wine . . . the civilized refreshment." Robert Lawrence Balzer

OUTTAKES: HANDLING THE PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When director Luis Mandoki ("White Palace") dropped out of the Steve 
Roth/Universal production of "Mobsters" a few weeks ago, Michael Karbelnikoff 
got the break he's been working toward for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran director of TV spots for Levi's 501 jeans, Bud Light and other 
products was picked to step in, and now faces the pressure of directing a name 
cast -- and his first feature. 
</P>
<P>
Sources tell us that Christian Slater will play gangster Lucky Luciano in the 
big-budget production, due to start shooting next month, with Patrick Dempsey 
as Meyer Lansky, Richard Grieco as Bugsy Siegel and a female love interest yet 
to be cast (sources say Emily Lloyd and Uma Thurman are among top contenders). 
</P>
<P>
"It's more overwhelming than normal because I came into it late," says 
Karbelnikoff, referring to his three-week pre-production time, "but I have a 
great support system around me." 
</P>
<P>
Karbelnikoff's feature-film directing experience is limited to an uncompleted 
one-hour project that he financed himself, but he still expresses confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't take this moment, and make it the best thing that ever happened in 
my life, then I'm a fool," he says. "Getting scared and all that is not what 
I've been in film 15 years to do." Kevin Koffler

OUTTAKES: 'GHOST': WHY IT'S STILL SCARING UP REPEAT BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' "Ghost," which opened in early July, just won't vanish. 
Last weekend -- its 18th -- it even jumped 34% over the previous week, coming 
in third for the week with grosses of $4.3 million. Its take to date: more than 
$186 million, making it the year's top-grosser. 
</P>
<P>
To investigate the "Ghost" phenomenon, Paramount has taken out classified ads 
in a handful of Los Angeles papers, including The Times, looking for fans who 
have seen the film six or more times. There have been hundreds of responses, 
says a studio spokesman, "and they're still coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those surveyed gushed about the love story. Some said they were 
"intrigued" by the theme. A number singled out Whoopi Goldberg's performance as 
the clairvoyant who reunites ghostly Patrick Swayze with earthly love Demi 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Outtakes talked to a few of the "Ghost" fans directly: 
</P>
<P>
Julie Richey -- Burbank mother of two and an insurance property examiner -- 
plans on seeing it today for the 18th time. "'It's really strange, isn't it? I 
think that before, the most I'd ever seen a film was five times -- back when I 
was a teen-ager. I'm in my mid-30s now. Who'd have guessed this would happen? 
My husband says, 'Oh no, not again!' " 
</P>
<P>
She says she loves the story -- "the idea of what happens after death" -- and 
the performances, especially Swayze's. "I think this is a case where everyone 
was well-cast. And the story, well, it makes you feel so good. One time when I 
saw it, a man sitting in front of me -- a total stranger -- turned around at 
the end and said, 'They should make more movies like this.' Of course, I 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Meza -- a bank section manager from Los Angeles -- has seen it eight 
times. "It's a great fantasy that seems totally real. That's what you go to see 
a movie for, isn't it? It reminds me of some of the films of the '30s. You 
leave it feeling great." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Irvin -- a nurse from Ontario -- has racked up a dozen screenings. "I've 
had a lot of deaths in my family this past year -- eight people who were close 
to me. Because of the way the movie presents death, it's been so comforting -- 
it's actually helped me to deal with a lot of things. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the love story, too. I love the idea that love enables people to go on 
-- and that the people you knew and loved are still out there, somewhere . . . 
even helping you to go on." " 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost" has even made its way into lectures. Marianne Williamson, who teaches 
what she calls "A Course in Miracles" -- "spiritual psychotherapy" -- through 
the L.A. Center for Living in California, says she sometimes mentions both 
"Ghost" and "Flatliners" because of the issues they raise regarding death. 
</P>
<P>
She attributes "Ghost's"' popularity, in part, to her belief that it "validates 
the deeper convictions of the heart -- that a relationship is more than two 
bodies coming together, it's the joining of two hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, who counsels an HIV-positive AIDS support group, saw the film with 
her group -- which gave it a thumbs-up. "Everybody loved it. Because it's about 
the triumph of love, beyond death, beyond the body. When you think about it, 
love is really what everyone wants." 
</P>
<P>
Still on 1,713 screens, "Ghost" will stay in the marketplace, says Paramount, 
"as long as it continues to make money." 
</P>
<P>
At present, the studio says there are no tangible plans for a "Ghost II." Pat 
H. Broeske

COMPLETION OF the 65-mile-long Backbone Trail along the spine of the Santa 
Monica Mountains is a longtime dream of local hikers. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the trail -- which will ultimately link Pacific Palisades 
to Pt. Mugu -- is finished, and November has been named Backbone Trail month. 
Celebrations include guided hikes along the nature paths, scenic overlooks and 
trails leading through the diverse ecosystems. JOHN MCKINNEY

MARSHALL: "THREE PENITENTIAL VISIONS," "HIDDEN VOICES." With soprano Cheryl 
Bensman Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
Nonesuch 9 79227-2 (compact disc). "Hidden Voices" is filled with cries and 
whispers, electronically sampled from various sources and processed in digital 
loops, with the distant purity of Rowe's soaring hymn only the icing on a 
complex confection. Art and craft are all of a part in Ingram Marshall's work, 
in a seemingly inevitable union of music and means. More traditionally 
developed, atmospheric tapescapes, the "Penitential Visions" share Marshall's 
love of bells with the "Visions." JOHN HENKEN

BACH: "ITALIAN" CONCERTO; FRENCH SUITE NO. 5; FRENCH OVERTURE, BWV 831. 
</P>
<P>
Andras Schiff, piano. Omega OCD 1014. Schiff's Bach playing can seem 
two-dimensional to the Gould-touched listener. Here, Schiff subverts all detail 
to the melodic line, which he explores in a calm, singing style, always 
avoiding overstatement. Coloristic shadings and varied articulation, too, are 
eschewed. Yet these undemonstrative readings are engaging in their own way, as 
a study in Bach's flowing melodicism. TIMOTHY MANGAN

"CATHERINE CROZIER AT GRACE CATHEDRAL." Delos DE 3090 (compact disc). The 
veteran organist makes characteristically controlled, conservatively 
registered, musically persuasive cases for monuments of German Romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
Mendelssohn's Sonata No. 6, in D minor, and two of Schumann's B-A-C-H fugues 
benefit most from her deeply serious approach, while Liszt's Prelude and Fugue 
on B-A-C-H and Reubke's "94th Psalm" Sonata need an injection of fantasy and 
bravura dazzle as well as the astounding mechanical mastery. Delos captures the 
sound of the Aeolian-Skinner/Casavant instrument in the reverberant San 
Francisco cathedral with typical flair and fidelity. JOHN HENKEN

BOINGO BOOMERANG: After six years (and four albums) at MCA Records, L.A. fave 
Oingo Boingo is leaving the label and looking for greener pastures. Expect an 
avid bidding war for the popular local band, which is already being courted by 
Epic Associates and Charisma Records. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boingo leader Danny Elfman, Hollywood's reigning movie-score wizard, 
is putting the finishing touches on his score for Tim Burton's upcoming film, 
"Edward Scissorhands." And thanks to MCA Records, you can now hear Elfman's 
greatest film-score hits. Titled "Danny Elfman: Music For a Darkened Theatre," 
the new compilation (due out this week) features excerpts from such movie 
themes as "Batman," "Dick Tracy," "Pee Wee's Big Adventure," "Dark Man," 
"Beetlejuice" and "Midnight Run." The package also offers previously unreleased 
material from "Scrooged" and such TV projects as "The Simpsons," "Tales From 
the Crypt" and "The Jar," a Tim Burton-directed episode from "Alfred Hitchcock 
Presents."

Stryper needed to be born again after its dismal 1988 album "In God We Trust." 
So the erstwhile evangelistic heavy-metal band has dropped all Jesus 
references, toughened the sound and turned in a credible, stylistically varied 
repositioning effort. There's nothing too imaginative here, although Stryper's 
continuing profession of Christian values (this time without the dogma) makes 
for some interesting contrasts with metal's typically libertine outlook. MIKE

The British rock Establishment's big summer charity bash comes across as a 
staid affair indeed on this unimaginative, often leaden double live album. 
Virtually everything, from the few reasonably good performances (Elton John, 
Paul McCartney, Dire Straits), to the preponderance of bad to mediocre ones 
(Genesis, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, Robert Plant) is overly familiar and 
available in better renditions elsewhere. Passable Tears For Fears and trivial 
Status Quo and Cliff Richard performances round out this two-hour plus stroll 
through well-intentioned boredom. MIKE BOEHM

unfocused that the occasional good cuts seem like random strokes of luck. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Elektra was and is goes undefined, as "Rubaiyat's" excessiveness 
neutralizes the company's identity. 
</P>
<P>
For those who bite, here's a guide to help get a grip on it: 
</P>
<P>
Hottest commercial formula: the Cure + the Doors . . . Best metal-plating: 
Faster Pussycat's "You're So Vain" . . . Most imaginative transformations: the 
Gipsy Kings' Catalonian "Hotel California" . . . Mismatch (singer over song): 
Ernie Isley doing the Cars' "Let's Go" . . . Mismatch (song over singer): 
Love's "Seven &amp; Seven Is" by Billy Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant surprise (song and singer): Dennis Linde's "Hello, I Am Your Heart," 
sung by Sara Hickman . . . Pleasant surprise (general): Jackson Browne's 
singing on the Incredible String Band's "First Girl I Loved" . . . Perfect 
matches: They Might Be Giants doing Phil Ochs, 10,000 Maniacs doing Jackson 
Browne, John Zorn doing the Stooges . . . Worst song: "I'd Like to Teach the 
World to Sing." RICHARD CROMELIN

<P>
HERE ARE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 28 QUESTION: WHAT OLD SHOWS SHOULD BE REMADE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The show I would most like to see remade is "Hawaii Five-0." It was a 
high-quality police drama that didn't rely on car chases and half-dressed women 
instead of a solid plot. The writing was of consistently high quality and the 
actors fit their parts well, particularly Jack Lord as supercop Steve 
McGarrett. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it could be remade with Lord continuing to play McGarrett as the 
governor of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Harter, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
In answer to your question about what old shows should be remade, I think one 
should be "Lost In Space" and another should be "The Fugitive." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Moore, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
I'd love to see someone remake "The Fugitive." There was something about the 
story that kept myself, and I'll bet a lot of other people, interested in 
following the adventures of Dr. Richard Kimble played by the late David 
Janssen. 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Jones, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
As a fan of the series "Route 66S and George Maharis, I would like to see that 
show remade with Maharis and Martin Milner. It was outstanding in 1960 and 
would be as well in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Koff, Encino 
</P>
<P>
With interest in extraterrestrials and UFOs soaring, it is time to bring back 
"The Invaders," the well-executed series from 1967 that focused on a young 
architect's quest to thwart an alien takeover of the world. Roy Thinnes, the 
star of that series, could take up where he left off, combatting the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Franklin R. Ruehl, Glendale 
</P>
<P>
I feel that shows like "Gilligan's Island," "I Dream of Jeannie," "Bewitched" 
and "Magnum, P.I." should be remade because of their style, actors and 
originality. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Martindale, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see a "Playhouse 90S series-and I don't mean Pee Wee's, 
although my kids love that- where television plays could be presented, each of 
them complete and individual, an hour long, like the early days of television. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it would be refreshing to have a good variety show on once a week on a 
network where children's choruses, magicians, singers and other seldom-seen 
entertainers could perform. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Wills, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
My answer to the show that should be remade is "Palmerstown, U.S.A." If remade, 
all of the original cast should be hired, if possible. The story and series is 
set in Palmerstown, Tenn., in 1935 and presents a view of life in a small town 
where whites and blacks co-exist for economic survival. 
</P>
<P>
W.A. Scott, La Canada 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see a classy remake of "Bewitched," along the same lines as 
"Star Trek: The Next Generation." What's happened through the years to the 
Stevens family? I'd love to see Whoopie Goldberg make a guest appearance as a 
nymph. Or Shirley MacLaine as a wacky aunt. How about Jack Nicholson as a 
replacement for Uncle Arthur? No one could replace Agnes Moorehead as the 
prank-playing mother (Endora). But someone along those lines could bring some 
new blood to the show.

COVER STORY: MORE MARY; 
</P>
<P>
MTM SAYS GOOD ROLES ARE HARD TO COME BY, BUT HERE'S HER SECOND TV MOVIE THIS 
MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Mary Tyler Moore's television series, "Annie McGuire," died quietly on 
CBS two years ago, the warm, familiar star silently stepped out of sight too. 
Frustrated by CBS' handling of the show and the shortage of roles for women 
over 50, she sold her production company, MTM, and built a country house in 
Upstate New York with her husband, Robert Levine. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid vegetable gardens and horses and dogs, Moore -- "Mary" to most of 
America -- did something that 35 years on the stage and screen have mostly 
prevented: She enjoyed her role as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily have the guts to take advantage of all the freedoms that I 
have," Moore said. "For example, when I was a co-owner of MTM, I never -- as 
Jane Fonda and a number of other actresses do -- developed my own projects. I 
just wanted to act. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have this country place, I love the serenity, and the gardening, 
and the horses and, you know, I practically carry on conversations with trees." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was taking a break on the set of the black comedy "Thanksgiving Day." The 
"NBC Monday Night Movie" depicts an off-center family coping with life after 
the death of their father, played by Tony Curtis, who drops dead in the 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is Moore's second this month -- "The Last Best Year" co-starring 
Bernadette Peters aired two weeks ago on ABC. The previous time that Moore 
starred in a dramatic television project was in 1987, in the NBC miniseries 
"Gore Vidal's Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are probably fewer roles written for women of a certain age, as 
they used to say," the five-time Emmy winner said politely, her hands folded in 
her lap. Moore spoke from inside her air-conditioned trailer on a dusty, 
stifling day in Malibu Canyon. Her hair was clipped comfortably short, and she 
wore tight faded jeans and a halter top, revealing a taut stomach that belied 
her 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
The former dancer traditionally has played women much younger than her age, but 
she says those days are over, as evidenced by her role as an eccentric widow 
trying to strike out on her own in "Thanksgiving Day." 
</P>
<P>
"What Mary shows is that women over 50 are still sexy, and are still funny, and 
are still vital," co-writer and producer Jeff Buhai said. "In one scene, she 
has a fantasy love dance in a supermarket with Nitro," one of the beefy stars 
of the syndicated "American Gladiators" TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that she can still portray youth, but "not without an awful lot of 
effort. I mean, they'd have to get out every light made in Hollywood and put it 
at just the right angle for me to play a young woman." 
</P>
<P>
After the beloved "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" folded in 1977, Moore dabbled in 
misfired TV series and variety shows, finding film success in "Ordinary People" 
and Broadway nods in "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and "Sweet Sue." She was also a 
hit in TV movies, notably "Heartsounds" with James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Moore was welcomed back by critics in "Annie McGuire," a subtle adult 
TV comedy series without a laugh track. But in a thicket of such fresh TV faces 
as Roseanne Barr and Candice Bergen, CBS scheduled the new thoroughly modern 
Mary in an 8:30 p.m. time slot, after the slapstick "Van Dyke Show" sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some genius thought that would be a nifty idea -- They're back to back 
and back together," Moore said, referring to her years on CBS as Laura Petrie, 
the perky wife on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" from 1961-66. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't belong in that time period," she said. "We weren't a children's 
show. We were aiming for a sophisticated audience, and we should have been on 
at 9 or 9:30 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she would ever return to television in a series, she resounded: 
"No! I really am not interested in doing a series again. What I'd like to 
continue -- well, no, it's just so damn disappointing . . . I'm just not going 
to do that again. I'm not going to put my blood and sweat and tears into 
something, and then have no control over the final and most important aspect of 
the making of a series, which is where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
In person, turning her emotions inside out, Moore was not unlike one of the 
sensitive, courageous women she often portrays. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffer . . . from low self-esteem," she said. "I mean, I'm getting better at 
it. God knows I ought to, by this time, with a lot of self-analysis and 
searching. I used to make myself the center of every disaster, and always blame 
myself whenever a project went wrong. But that can really be the result of a 
big ego." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she is currently arranging a movie-of-the-week package with one of 
the networks and wants to do more feature films. 
</P>
<P>
"I've turned down quite a few (scripts). Not as many as I'd like. I'd like to 
be able to say I've turned down every script that was offered to anybody, but 
there are those long fallow periods where nothing is offered. And at those 
times I revert to my old ways and say, 'Well, of course it figures, because I'm 
not talented, and I'm not likable, and nobody wants me, and it's over."' 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Moore projects will come. In the meantime, what is the actress really 
looking forward to? 
</P>
<P>
She smiled distantly. 
</P>
<P>
"A new asparagus crop." 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving Day" airs Monday, 9-11 p.m. on NBC.

<P>
RON SILVER'S POLITICS AGREE WITH TNT'S MOVIE ABOUT TORTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Silver looks like a Talmudic scholar and has entertained Madonna at a seder 
dinner in his suburban home. The intense, bearded actor enjoys the 
contradictions of fame- and the uses that can be made of celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that people like cab drivers and teachers don't get a lot of 
attention from the media," says Silver. "But, if it takes the presence of a 
Whoopi Goldberg or a Billy Crystal to help draw attention to a problem like 
homelessness, then that's a perfectly legitimate use of celebrity. If you're 
privileged enough to have people shoving mikes in your face, you ought to use 
that platform effectively." 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Creative Coalition, a lobbying group of about 200 arts and 
entertainment figures, Silver recently joined actors Alec Baldwin, Christopher 
Reeve and other celebrities in working the halls of Congress in support of the 
National Endowment for the Arts. "I think that public personalities can 
dissipate their influence by not taking the time to get informed on an issue," 
Silver says. "One of the obligations of being in our group is that you have to 
take the time to learn about the issue at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Silver, who first gained attention as Valerie Harper's obnoxious neighbor in 
"Rhoda," has an opportunity to match his advocacy with his acting on a TNT 
movie premiering this week. He plays an American drawn into the horrors of 
political torture in the two-hour "Forgotten Prisoners: The Amnesty Files." 
</P>
<P>
Silver recently has been praised by critics for his performances in a wide 
variety of movie roles. He made a womanizing lout sympathetic in Paul 
Mazursky's "Enemies: A Love Story," and he has been described as the "tough, 
unsentimental conscience" of "Reversal of Fortune," the new movie about the 
Claus von Bulow attempted-murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
The TNT movie, which is drawn from the files of Amnesty International, the 
human-rights organization, focuses on cases of torture of political prisoners 
in Turkey. A former torture victim who had spent years in a Turkish prison was 
an adviser on the film. The characters, however, are drawn from composites 
because, the producers say, using specific events could put lives in danger. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Silver plays a somewhat naive American, a specialist in 
international law, who goes to Turkey as an Amnesty representative to observe 
the trials of a group of political prisoners. He becomes involved in trying to 
free the group, which includes a teen-age boy and a political cartoonist. 
</P>
<P>
The movie shows the effects of torture, but it also shows the potentially 
positive effects of letter-writing campaigns by members of Amnesty on behalf of 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"When you read about hundreds of people being detained, it may be hard to focus 
on their stories," says Silver, who has been a member of Amnesty International 
for many years. "But, in this TV movie, you see individuals and their families. 
Hopefully, watching the movie will help people see torture victims as something 
more than statistics." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his activities with lobbying organizations, Silver also has 
campaigned on his own for a number of liberal candidates in both the Republican 
and Democratic parties. Earlier this month, Silver joined New York Gov. Mario 
Cuomo in stumping for an environmental bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
With all of this activity, is he considering running for office himself? 
</P>
<P>
"What?" he asks, laughing. "And lose the influence that I have now?" 
</P>
<P>
"Forgotten Prisoners: The Amnesty Files" airs on TNT Monday at 5-7 p.m., 7-9 
p.m., 9-11 p.m., 11 p.m.-1a.m.; Tuesday at 7-9 a.m., 1-3 p.m., and Saturday at 
7-9 p.m.

Oct. 28 letter writer Lev Mailer expresses his disappointment that Barry 
Levinson's movie "Avalon" wasn't Jewish enough. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me Levinson can't win. Had he cast only Jews in the central roles, 
he would've invited angry letters about standing in the way of non-traditional 
casting. And had the film been dripping with Jewish iconography, he would've 
left himself open to criticism that he is furthering racial stereotypes.

So the British have to listen to new records on the radio instead of the ones 
they already own (Jeff Kaye, "It's Not Only Rock and Roll," Oct. 21). 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why young bands like the Pixies can develop big followings in 
Europe, while still being outsold by the Doors over here. 
</P>
<P>
Pretending that yesterday's pop is "serious" rock is only a rationalization by 
thirtysome- things who still like the radio but hate the new "bubble-gum" music 
-- just as their parents did 20 years ago. The British Radio Authority is 
right: We don't need to hear "Stairway to Heaven" on the radio anymore. We can 
hear it on elevators now.

CHEERING CONTEMPORARY ART'S 'DEATH THROES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Victory, but No Relief," Nov. 4: After reading Allan Parachini's interview 
with Dennis Barrie of the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, it's clear to me 
that cultural elitists such as Barrie who control the art world today are 
completely out of touch. These charlatans are trying to hoodwink Americans (and 
our spineless Congress) into believing that pornography is art. 
</P>
<P>
It won't work. We're on to them. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie's preposterous assertion that freedom of expression is at stake (yes, he 
even used that tired, old fallback) is itself further proof that the 
contemporary art world is in its final death throes. Good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
Pornographic photos by nasty little men like Robert Mapplethorpe are not art. 
And contrary to Mr. Barrie's view, what's really at stake here is Americans' 
right to call a spade a spade. Our refusal to fund this trash is no more 
censorship than our refusal to patronize the dirty peep shows these museums 
call art exhibits.

In response to Pete and Maria Francis' remarks about NC-17 and the number of 
times suggestive words appear in "Henry &amp; June" ads, I say that if they 
counted the times that words in movie ads -- and in the movies themselves -- 
pertain to violence, murder, mutilation and drugs, they would be appalled. 
</P>
<P>
Self-righteous people should lighten up and concentrate on the things that are 
destroying the world instead of berating movies or ads that contain (sexual) 
words and feature some nudity. 
</P>
<P>
I do not care if someone gets a little aroused from a movie that depicts sex, 
but I do care if someone tries to emulate Rambo or some crazed killer in a 
motion picture.

AND NOW, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE NEW NC-17 MOVIE RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The protests against the much-needed NC-17 rating are naive. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, for some time film distributors had been able to easily overcome the 
"no X-rated-film-advertising/censorship" problem: Simply release a film with no 
rating at all. 
</P>
<P>
Hence there is absolutely no difference between the NC-17 rated "Henry &amp; 
June" and numerous unrated films over the years.

WEST POINT ORDERS ABOUT-FACE ON 108-YEAR TRADITION OF HAZING CADETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HILL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
WEST POINT, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new class of cadets at the U.S. Military Academy this year has been spared 
a disciplinary ritual as old as West Point itself. 
</P>
<P>
Hazing of first-year cadets, or plebes, has been abolished. 
</P>
<P>
But at this 188-year-old school, hazing is a tradition that has survived reform 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Plebes of old had to do such things as memorize how many ice cubes go in the 
drinks of upperclassmen. Or double-time around the barracks at 120 steps a 
minute, squaring corners like robots. Or study New York Times articles, ready 
to repeat them verbatim at the whim of older cadets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rite of passage that we aren't doing anymore," says Todd Manninen, a 
third-year student from Unionville, Mich. "It's a tradition that they've been 
doing forever." 
</P>
<P>
It was intended to teach discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Upperclassmen had the right to come up to any first-year students wearing a 
crooked cap or dingy belt buckle and literally shout in their face the proper 
rules for conduct. 
</P>
<P>
But what upset many here were the "unwritten but nonetheless tolerated 
practices" of the upperclassmen under what was called the fourth-class system, 
according to Col. H. Steven Hammond, whose commandant's office oversees 
military training for the cadets. 
</P>
<P>
"You would read (the rules) and say, 'Well this sounds OK.' But in terms of how 
it was practiced, there was much opportunity and great potential for abuse by 
the upper-class cadets," Hammond says. 
</P>
<P>
The abuses differed from the mistreatments piled on unlucky civilian college 
fraternity pledges. West Point hazing was supposedly instituted to improve the 
character of neophyte officer candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In the name of leadership, plebes were mandated to learn not only military 
history, but pages of other trivia and gibberish that, in effect, equaled an 
extra academic course. But what really rankled Hammond and others was that 
upperclassmen were so busy trying to lead plebes, they didn't spend enough time 
working on their own character. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people in the past here saw the seniors' role as placing stress on 
the subordinate," he says. "But the leaders' role is to remove stress." 
</P>
<P>
So this semester, with little ado, the Cadet Leadership Development System was 
unveiled. At the heart of this new system are 15 rules defining the proper way 
for a military leader to act toward subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
This fall's plebes now just have to read the Times, not memorize the front 
page. 
</P>
<P>
However, many who passed through hazing voice regret. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell by looking in their eyes that the plebes wish it was the same," 
Manninen says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the same," says Robin Schuck, a female senior from Davenport, Iowa. 
"When I was a plebe, anybody could tell you your brass buckle needed a shine. 
Now only someone in your chain of command can make a correction." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it's easier," says John Shugena, a plebe. "A lot of the things 
we have to do, the upperclassmen had to do. We still have to be familiar with 
world events." 
</P>
<P>
Some cadets have taken to calling the freshman class "getovers" -- as in those 
who "get over" by doing as little work as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond though, emphatically rejects the idea that plebes have it any easier 
than their forebears or that West Point is becoming "a Harvard on the Hudson." 
</P>
<P>
"Every single class that has ever come here has been told during their freshman 
year that 'you got it easier,' " Hammond says. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they do. 
</P>
<P>
"Deviling" was such an arduous pastime early in the 19th Century that an 
academy superintendent advised plebes standing guard duty to use their bayonets 
against relentless upperclassmen tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the death of a former cadet linked to hazing 
provoked a national scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar L. Booz died of tubercular laryngitis 18 months after he dropped out of 
the academy. But his family blamed his death on daily dosages of Tabasco sauce 
his older schoolmates forced him to drink. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional committee uncovered other abuses, such as forcing plebes to sit 
on bayonets or slide naked down splintered boards. 
</P>
<P>
One young first-year cadet called to testify before Congress, Douglas 
MacArthur, was forced to recall his own humiliations. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur biographer William Manchester recounts in "American Caesar" that the 
future general in command of U.S. forces in the Far East was once laid 
unconscious and sent into convulsions after three separate groups of 
upperclassmen forced him to perform deep knee bends over broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
Hazing was modified in the wake of scandal, but the almost sacred rite of 
passage could not be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
George Patton, class of 1909, mentioned in personal letters how upperclassmen 
made sure that he would always "brace," that is eat and walk so erect as to 
push his chin into his gullets. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight D. Eisenhower once recalled his own plebe year in 1911 as "double-time 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps remembering his own humiliation, MacArthur curtailed abuses of the 
fourth-class system upon his appointment in 1919 as superintendent of West 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
But once again, while the physical brutality lessened, the ritual remained. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond says previous attempts at reform failed because they attacked the 
symptoms of abuse, not the cause. For example, bracing was abolished (in the 
1960s) only to give rise to pinging, double-timing around the barracks, 
squaring the corners. 
</P>
<P>
But the new reform is fundamentally different, he says. 
</P>
<P>
This time, cadets both past and present worked with faculty and staff for years 
to make reports and suggest changes. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond says the Cadet Leadership Development System cuts right through to the 
very purpose of the academy: "To provide the nation with leaders of character 
who serve the common defense." 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership" and "character" are sacred terms here. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Army's concept of leadership that initiated the change. And despite 
the grumblings, it's the cadet's respect for leadership that will make or break 
the new system.

LEFTISTS FIND GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS IN EAST-WEST THAW; 
</P>
<P>
RADICALS: FOREIGN POLICY CRITICS WORRY THAT LOSS OF THE SOVIET UNION AS THE 
ENEMY ALSO MEANS LOSS OF A POWERFUL DETERRENT TO U.S. INTERVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
These are days of reassessment for the radical left in the United States. The 
compass points in a familiar direction, but many of the old landmarks are gone. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe has been a bittersweet turning 
point for American radicals, who have often defined themselves in European 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of forces American radicals back to step one, or back to their own 
deepest instincts," said Paul Buhle, an editor of the Encyclopedia of the 
American Left. "They can't borrow from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing intellectuals and political leaders in this country are virtually 
unanimous in their support for democracy in Eastern Europe, and most have 
rejoiced in the passing of what Socialist Irving Howe calls "the historical 
tragedy called Stalinism." 
</P>
<P>
Still, they recognize that the changes have saddled the left with something of 
an image problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfectly clear that, for a time, we will suffer a backlash," said Howe. 
"One must be honest about this. There is no question that what happened 
represents at least a partial triumph of capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
Howe's point is by no means universally accepted, as little is on the left. The 
radical left spans an ideological continent, from the liberal side of the 
Democratic Party to fringe groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party and 
the Progressive Labor Party. Skirmishes within that territory -- between 
Socialists and Communists, say -- can be as fierce as those between the left 
and the right. 
</P>
<P>
David Plotke, political science professor at Yale University, said of the term 
socialism: "If there's a group that includes Willy Brandt, Gorbachev, the 
Italian Communist Party and Pol Pot, that's not a very thick term." 
</P>
<P>
There are some points on which most American leftists would agree, however. One 
is that the changes in Eastern Europe should help their cause, because they 
remove the stigma of a Red Menace. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a great burden lifted from us," said David McReynolds, a leader in the 
Socialist Party U.S.A. who ran for President in 1980 and, at 60, can remember 
the smear era of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
The perception of a global communist threat has long plagued the left, 
communist and non-communist alike. Now, McReynolds said: "No matter what 
happens, the left no longer has to look over its shoulder and apologize for the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say there is no nostalgia for the bad old days. Critics of U.S. 
foreign policy worry about how the United States will react to the demise of 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever one thinks of the Soviet Union -- good, bad or indifferent -- over 
the years, it has served as a deterrent to U.S. force," said linguist Noam 
Chomsky, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "So, that 
deterrent effect is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Few leftist leaders believe the changes in Eastern Europe will have a 
significant effect on the memberships of left-wing organizations in this 
country. Most of them have been shrinking for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Marks of the Communist Party U.S.A. said that the party has perhaps 
25,000 members, and is optimistic about future growth. Other sources said that 
Marks' figures sounded far too high; they also laughed off the Communist 
Party's importance to the modern American left. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party is in a very odd position," McReynolds said. "They've had 
a sort of franchise from Moscow to run things here. That's breaking down. The 
Soviet Union doesn't give a tinker's damn about what's happening to the 
communist parties around the world. . . . They're in a position that you really 
have to have a sense of humor to appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds, Howe and other leftist leaders openly acknowledged that their 
organizations (Howe is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America) 
are minor league players on the political scene. The future, they said, 
probably belongs to some new movement that may not yet exist. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Raskin, a former aide to President John F. Kennedy who is now co-director 
of the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal Washington think tank, is 
editing a special issue of The Nation magazine that will assess the state of 
the left. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he said: "There is nothing to suggest that capitalism is 
anything but a very unstable system." On the other hand: "There is nothing to 
suggest that state socialism is anything but a collapsed system." 
</P>
<P>
What's needed, Raskin said, "is something quite new and different." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever that something is, Raskin believes, it probably will involve strong 
commitments to improving the environment and promoting civil liberties. Others 
said that such a movement would need to address the interests of racial 
minorities, homosexuals and women. 
</P>
<P>
Many on the left said that American radicals can assist the emerging democratic 
movements of Eastern Europe.

NARCOTICS CASES CLOGGING UP COURTS, DELAYING CIVIL MATTERS AND OVERCROWDING 
JAILS 
</P>

<P>
Drug cases have clogged urban courts, delayed civil matters, overcrowded jails 
and stirred new debate over the best possible solution -- legalization or more 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to look at the largest single cause of caseload glut, drugs are 
it," said Albert Alschuler, professor at the University of Chicago Law School. 
"We're having fewer and fewer trials, particularly on the civil side. No one 
can afford to wait. The system's just become unworkable." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the impact is on state courts, which process about 97 percent of drug 
arrests. But the federal system also is feeling the crunch. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Drug cases in federal courts increased by 280% since 1980, Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist said last December in his annual end-of-the-year report. 
He urged Congress to act immediately on a proposal to create new judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a measure to create 77 new 
judgeships. The bill is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
* Federal drug cases represented more than 26% of new criminal filings, and up 
to 60% in some districts, Rehnquist said. Nearly 55% of criminal appeals 
involved drug offenses, compared with 30% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
* The drug caseload rose by 56% in 17 big-city courts between 1983 and 1987, 
according to a 1989 report, "The Impact of Drug Cases on Case Processing in 
Urban Trial Courts." Among the major increases: Boston, 175%; Jersey City, 
N.J., 114%; the Bronx borough of New York City, 109%, and Oakland, 95%. 
</P>
<P>
* Drug-related cases made up about a quarter of felonies disposed of in 26 
big-city courts in 1987, the report said. It noted that number actually is low 
because it doesn't count incidents in which drugs were involved but didn't 
constitute the most serious charge. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has turned even grimmer since then; in Detroit, the percentage of 
state court drug cases more than doubled from 1987 to 1989, said John Goerdt, 
the report's co-author and senior staff attorney at the National Center for 
State Courts. 
</P>
<P>
Drug cases, he added, are "starting to show up in family courts, in juvenile 
courts, with abused and neglected kids." 
</P>
<P>
When courts are stressed, "nobody can render the same quality of justice," said 
James Fyfe, a criminal justice professor at American University in Washington, 
D.C. "We all know the old saw that justice delayed is justice denied. Evidence 
disappears. Recollections grow dimmer." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters, experts say, are new mandatory sentencing laws, leading 
some defendants to seek trial rather than pleading guilty, adding to the 
backlog. 
</P>
<P>
In Goerdt's report, jury trials in the 26 big-city courts disposed of only 6% 
of all felonies in 1987.

When Kamal Abu-Haidar, 30, had a flat tire on his way home on a main highway in 
central Lebanon one Saturday evening, he waited seven hours before a lone car 
pulled over and its driver loaned him a jack. 
</P>
<P>
One month earlier, the bustling road into Lebanon's mountain resorts east of 
Beirut was constantly jammed with vehicles carrying people until the morning's 
first light. 
</P>
<P>
Abu-Haidar's saviors were a group of Syrian soldiers on patrol in the newly 
conquered Christian area of Lebanon, which Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian 
rebel chief, ruled for two years until he finally gave up in October. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian attack that led to Aoun's ouster cost 700 lives and about $12 
million in property damage in the Christian areas. It also claimed another 
casualty: feelings of defeat, pessimism and submission among the Christian 
Lebanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon without Christians will not be the same Lebanon again. They had better 
name it something else," said Nazik Yared, a Christian writer and professor at 
Beirut University College. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Christian areas will witness massive emigration such as has never 
been seen before," she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Abu-Haidar, who lives in the hilltop village of Mansouriyeh in the Metin area 
northeast of Beirut, used to enjoy watching from his balcony the lines of cars 
heading to trendy night spots scattered through the picturesque villages and 
resorts nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"Last (Saturday) night only two cars drove by. Their occupants must have been 
pro-Syrian militiamen, otherwise they would not have dared to go out at night," 
Abu-Haidar said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the Christians now living under Syrian control, Abu-Haidar prefers 
to stay at home after dark. He locks himself, his wife and their only child in 
as soon as he returns from work at 6 every evening. 
</P>
<P>
He is fed up with the country. "There is no water, telephones or electricity. 
But we were in an area which was free of any foreign presence. This used to be 
our consolation. Now, even that is gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Jumana, never contemplated emigrating until recently. "Even if I have 
to leave home briefly to buy vegetables or milk for my child, I have to endure 
the gazes, whispers and sometimes harassment by the Syrian soldiers surrounding 
our home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of East Beirut frequently hear radio reports of rape, looting and 
revenge killings of Christians by Syrian soldiers and their surrogate Muslim 
militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the reports have been exaggerated, various security sources 
note that they have been effective. An estimated 20,000 residents of East 
Beirut have fled to France, Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Of those unable to leave for financial reasons, some seldom report to work. 
Many are in hiding out of fear of revenge for their support of Aoun, residents 
in East Beirut say. 
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Kak, 45, a Muslim doctor at the American University of Beirut, sees the 
current development as the start of another cycle in Lebanon's violent history. 
</P>
<P>
"The Christians of East Beirut are having that same feeling of insecurity and 
abandonment which the Muslims of this country felt when Israel invaded their 
half of the capital in 1982," Kak said. "God help us when that ruthless wheel 
of history turns again."

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spring, Buenos Aires is a lovely city of flowers and darting sailboats, 
and an ugly one of shacktowns where hungry children kick soccer balls in dusty 
lots littered with garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Jacaranda, tipa and ceibo trees are flowering downtown and among the 
whitewashed houses and cobblestone streets in the comfortable northern suburbs. 
Every year, the blue, yellow and crimson petals form swirling carpets at the 
cafes of the Recoleta neighborhood, where afternoon tea remains a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
On the lush green fields of Hurlingham and other clubs, the best polo players 
in the world thunder past crowds of well-dressed fans. 
</P>
<P>
Sailboats dot the River Plate on weekends. The well-to-do have reserved houses 
at the shore for summer vacations in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
Outbound jetliners are booked solid beginning with the Christmas holidays, and 
the most expensive restaurants usually are full. For those with cash in their 
pockets, Argentina hardly seems mired in one of its worst recessions. 
</P>
<P>
Life is different in Azul, one of the villas miserias -- misery villages -- 
that have become too numerous to remain hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes by car from downtown beside the foul Riachuelo river, Azul is a 
collection of one-story metal and concrete-block shacks around a field of 
hard-packed earth where residents throw garbage and the children play. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the shacks have no running water, electricity or telephone. The men 
don't have jobs, their children drop out of school, and hardly anyone has 
enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a gun in my life; now I do," Ana Montiel, 36, said on a breezy 
morning at a day-care center operated by UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
There always have been very rich and very poor Argentines. What made the 
country different was its middle class, once the largest south of the Rio 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the middle class is being compressed by a severe recession that follows a 
decade of economic stagnation and 15 years of high inflation. Real salaries 
have fallen below 1980s' levels. Nearly one adult in five lacks a full-time job 
and the minimum monthly wage of 700,000 australs ($127) doesn't buy enough food 
to last a frugal family of four half that time. 
</P>
<P>
The recession, and a government austerity program that is cutting thousands of 
jobs from the public payroll, have been devastating for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina was among the world's most affluent nations during the first half of 
this century. Now, UNICEF says, nearly 25% of its families have serious 
deficiencies in housing, food, health or sanitary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20,000 children died from malnutrition or illness brought on by 
poor sanitary conditions last year and "70% of those deaths were preventable," 
said Eduardo Bustelo, UNICEF director in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
The government is aware of the problems, but seems helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"In the north of Argentina, diseases that had been eliminated have returned, 
like malaria and chagas," acknowledged Moises Ikonicoff, director of the 
Economy Ministry's planning office. 
</P>
<P>
Making things better will require "many years of effort and sacrifice," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Upper class "portenos," or port-dwellers, as residents of Buenos Aires are 
called, don't have to visit Azul or other shantytowns to see their suffering 
countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
When night falls, youths from slums behind the two central railroad terminals 
and under a major elevated highway scrounge in garbage cans for cardboard, 
newspapers and bottles to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Children sleep in doorways and parks, ask for handouts in restaurants and put 
bookmarks with religious or inspirational sayings on the knees of train and 
subway commuters, hoping for loose change in return. 
</P>
<P>
Civic boosters note legitimately that the situation is not nearly so desperate 
as in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, or Lima, Peru. 
</P>
<P>
For a city that prides itself on Parisian architecture and counts among its 
achievements the continent's first subway, skyscraper and biggest bank, that is 
small comfort.

WELFARE OF 1890S KEPT AID ON A PERSONAL LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: A CENTURY AGO, HELPING THE NEEDY WAS A ONE-ON-ONE PROJECT. AND THERE 
WAS NO FREE LUNCH.

<P>
Historian Marvin Olasky looked at how American society took care of its 
wretched poor 100 years ago and how it does it now, and concluded that people 
did it better then. 
</P>
<P>
Charity in the 1890s, he said, was not left to the welfare and charitable 
bureaucracies. Compassion was not dispensed via checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, he said, the poor were helped by ordinary working people not much 
better off than they. The needy were taken into private homes and church 
basements -- and shown the door if they refused to lift a hand on their own 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, charity involved compassion, he said, an element that is lost when 
helping the poor is left to institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Olasky, a University of Texas professor of journalism history, is on leave as a 
scholar-in-residence with an anti-abortion group, the Americans United for Life 
Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
He is writing a book about compassion, and spent a year at the Library of 
Congress digging into newspapers and magazines, studying how paupers were 
treated a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Then, for contrast, he spent a few days walking around Washington, posing as a 
homeless person. In shelters, he said, he got plenty to eat but no one ever 
suggested that he do anything for himself. At one shelter, he said, he asked 
for a Bible and got a stare instead. 
</P>
<P>
In an article he wrote for Policy Review, quarterly magazine of the Heritage 
Foundation, a conservative research organization, Olasky asked whether society 
is better off now than it was when charity was a matter of individual 
responsibility. He concluded that then was better than now. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bothwell, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive 
Philanthropy, a nonprofit organization that monitors the world of charity, 
expressed some doubts. Our industrialized society, he said, has eliminated many 
jobs that once supported the unskilled poor. 
</P>
<P>
Olasky decided that the way the poor are helped now is expedient, but 
ultimately unhelpful. 
</P>
<P>
"The major flaw of the modern welfare state is not that it is extravagant, but 
that it is too stingy," he wrote. "It gives the needy bread and tells them to 
be content with that alone. It gives the rest of us the opportunity to be 
stingy also, and to salve our consciences even as we scrimp on what many of the 
destitute need most -- love, time, and a challenge to be 'a little lower than 
the angels' rather than one thumb up from monkeys." 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, he said, people 100 years ago "made moral demands on 
recipients of aid. . . . They did not allow anyone to eat and run." 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, he wrote, charitable people, often poor themselves, provided 
food, shelter, work, organized excursions and summer camps, staffed 
dispensaries and ran schools, missions and reading rooms. 
</P>
<P>
New York City alone had 1,288 charitable organizations. Many of them looked 
after members of their own nationality group. First-generation Italians took 
care of new immigrants from the homeland; the same was true of Swedes, Irish, 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
Some charities had remarkably no-nonsense names, such as the Erring Woman's 
Refuge or the Union for Homeless and Friendless Girls. 
</P>
<P>
Women volunteers worked by day, men by night. 
</P>
<P>
These principles, Olasky said, prevailed: 
</P>
<P>
* Before someone received a handout, an effort was made to find a relative who 
could care for him. 
</P>
<P>
* Long-term, one-on-one contracts were forged between the volunteer and the 
needy person. 
</P>
<P>
* Charity went only to those "worthy of relief," that is, people who became 
poor through no fault of their own and were unable to change the situation 
quickly: the elderly, the chronically ill and children. The "shiftless and 
intemperate" were classified "not entitled to relief" and shown the door. 
Before a man got a meal, he was asked to spend two hours chopping wood. A needy 
woman was shown to the sewing room. 
</P>
<P>
"Wood yards next to shelters were as common in 1890," said Olasky, "as liquor 
stores are in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
* Relief was given only after need had been verified; "benign suspicion" was 
applied to those seeking aid. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoiding dependency on aid was crucial. "The goal of charity workers," said 
Olasky, "was to show poor people how to move up while resisting enslavement to 
the charity of governmental or private masters." 
</P>
<P>
* Charity had religious underpinnings. Groups such as the Industrial Christian 
Alliance didn't hesitate to remind the poor "that God made them and had high 
expectations for them." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Olasky spelled out his conclusions: "It all comes down to your 
understanding of what compassion is. Mutual obligation was essential. The 
person who was better off was obligated to 'suffer with,' not just write a 
check or pass a law. And the person who needed help was obligated to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if your definition of compassion is merely the provision of material 
help, then you're not going to like my suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell, of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, said he 
welcomed Olasky's "holistic" remedy -- that charity should treat the whole 
person, not just a segment of the problem -- but, he said, society has changed 
in fundamental ways since the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
In 19th-Century cities, sweatshops provided jobs for unskilled immigrants. The 
gap between the working and the unemployed was not great. Anyone could easily 
join the ranks of the respectfully employed by taking such a job. 
</P>
<P>
Today's counterpart job, Bothwell noted, might be flipping burgers in a 
fast-food restaurant, but that kind of work doesn't pay enough to keep a family 
from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
It is true, Bothwell said, that in this era of busy lives and two-income 
households, society largely has turned over to government the responsibility 
for welfare. But, he said, Olasky has overlooked the enormous amount of private 
help that still exists in a country with more than 800,000 nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, today's immigrants -- now likely to come from the Soviet Union, 
Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia -- still find their ethnic organizations 
to give them a lift. Newcomers still move in with those who preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that we've grown into a society that is much more distant than 
the world Olasky describes," Bothwell said. "So you devise different ways of 
assisting people, and one of them is the more distant, more automatic way of 
providing money to the destitute through the government's safety net."

MATURE WORKERS FACE ADDED OBSTACLES IN JOB SEARCH AS RECESSION LOOMS;

<P>
Sometimes Harry Worsey fears that he will never work again. 
</P>
<P>
In his darkest moments, he sees himself permanently labeled as an older person 
-- devalued and ignored in a job market that a looming recession makes tighter 
every day. When Worsey's company moved to New York, he believed that the 
economy that had never failed him before would provide him another job. 
</P>
<P>
But now it has been a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I not only have the typical problems of job searching that everyone seems to 
be having now, but I have problems-plus because I am considered a mature 
worker," said Worsey, a 56-year-old technical writer and editor who lives in 
Clarksburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
To become more flexible, Worsey is studying bookkeeping and computer technology 
during long afternoons at the public library. He has registered with two 
temporary employment agencies. And he attends job fairs, studies the classified 
ads and has lowered his salary requirements from the $38,500-a-year he was paid 
in his most recent job to a negotiable figure of $10,000 less. But he is 
worried that a 30-year career is ending. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to do as a mature worker," he 
said. "Aren't I worth anything anymore? Shouldn't I even send out my resume? 
Should I just lie down and say it's all over? For the first time in my working 
experience, I wonder if I will ever find a job." 
</P>
<P>
But giving up is not an option to Worsey and other over-50 workers who are 
finding the worsening economy taking their jobs while they are still too young 
for retirement pensions and Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
They too have mortgages to pay and, often, children in school. They still 
consider themselves quite young and certainly productive. They feel their 
decades of working experience have given them much to offer employers. Yet, 
they believe they are victims of a hidden form of discrimination that is 
spreading as the economy worsens. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it is humiliating to be looking for work again at this stage in their 
lives -- in contrast to younger people who may be more accustomed to changing 
jobs periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in economics and aging agree that mature workers have problems 
re-entering the work force in the best of times, despite federal laws 
prohibiting age discrimination. Now, they said, those difficulties are 
magnified by a shaky economy that already has rattled the ranks of contractors, 
consultants, engineers and managers. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of age-discrimination complaints is on the rise. It's one of the 
fastest-growing areas of the law," said David Gamse, of the Jewish Council for 
the Aging. "If a person is told that he or she is overqualified for a job, then 
that person is a victim of age discrimination, because you can't be 
overqualified -- you're either qualified or you're not." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nightmare to be out of work right now," said Richard Wainwright, 59, of 
Rockville, Md., who was vice president of research for an area engineering firm 
until cutbacks in June wiped out the research department. 
</P>
<P>
"You wake up in the morning thinking about it," he said. "Without faith in the 
Lord, you'd commit suicide. Things have to be paid and food has to be bought 
and gas put in the car. You're not used to scrimping. And you start worrying 
about crazy things like becoming a street person. You have those thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
"An employer can look at my resume and see that I'm a World War II veteran," 
said Robert W. Greene, of Hyattsville, Md., an electronic systems expert who 
was laid off in February at the age of 64 and is not ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to prove that the lack of response is due to my age," he said, 
"but I don't think companies right now like to get people into their insurance 
programs if they think we are going to cost them money. Rather than call us in 
for an interview and see how we look, they just stay away from us altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment statistics don't reflect the problem accurately, officials said, 
because the numbers do not include workers who were forced into early 
retirement, who had to take lesser jobs outside their fields or who have simply 
given up looking for work. In September, unemployment nationally for people 55 
and older was 3.5%, compared to 5.7% overall. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we find, if you're over 40, even, and you try to get back in the 
work force, you have to wear another hat and probably make less money," said 
Joan L. Kelly, of the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing you can really document," said Philip Rones, a senior 
economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, "but I think a lot of firms 
are uncomfortable hiring older people. There seem to be a lot of perceptions 
about older workers -- that they're resistant to change, unable to learn new 
things. The fact is, they are not drug addicts. They are likely to stay longer 
and not change jobs. And they were brought up in an era of different work 
values." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a fuller picture than anything supplied by statistics was offered 
recently at a Job Fair for Mature Workers in Rockville, Md., which attracted 
nearly 1,200 people. Nearly 60% of the applicants said they are looking for 
full-time work, compared to 27% last year. Hundreds of resumes piled up on the 
employer tables, telling stories of long careers abruptly ended and a desperate 
need to work again: 
</P>
<P>
"I am 60 years old and I have 40 years of experience," said an engineer from 
Rockville who was laid off because of defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked on projects in Trinidad, Turkey and Alaska," said a 58-year-old 
construction manager from Vienna, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"I have many good years of work ahead of me, I hope," said a former federal 
employee, also 58, who lives in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Employers who participated in the fair said they were surprised at the advanced 
backgrounds and skills of the applicants. Mature workers, they said, bring 
stability, experience and a sense of responsibility to their jobs. But asked 
about current openings, several admitted that their firms are in the midst of 
hiring freezes and have no jobs to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole wealth of resources here," said Vicki Pendleton, a recruiter 
for International Business Machines Corp., who said the company is doing 
"limited hiring" in the technical field and was bombarded with applicants at 
the fair. "I'm amazed at the excellent experience of these people." 
</P>
<P>
The event, which was sponsored by Job Support for Seniors, an employment 
program of the Jewish Council for the Aging, has doubled in size in each of its 
four years. This time, almost half the participants surveyed said they would 
like training in computers, an indication, coordinators said, of a willingness 
to change direction in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Worsey said, he is certainly willing to try something new. He 
would like to return to writing and editing, but he realizes that may not be 
possible. He gives thanks daily that his wife, Merilee, has a secure job as a 
corporate librarian.

JOUQUES, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a small graveyard nestled at the foot of this village in southern France, 
Belkacem Dahak stares proudly out of the photograph on his marble tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
Dahak, who left a wife and 10 children when he died of cancer in 1975 at the 
age of 44, was a Harki -- the Arab name for Algerians who fought in the French 
army during the seven-year Algerian war of independence. 
</P>
<P>
In this flowered cemetery, where 15 other Muslim tombstones bearing the Islamic 
crescent lie beside Christian graves, he at last shares the beauty of the 
surroundings on an equal basis with other Frenchmen. 
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Harkis and their families were brought to France to avoid 
reprisals when Algeria finally won independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many are still living in dramatically poor conditions. Unemployment and 
social rejection have left them bitter. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of their descendants under the age of 25 are out of work and the 
Harkis feel more is done for the Algerians who once fought against France -- 
and who now come here as immigrants -- than for them. 
</P>
<P>
While enjoying French citizenship, the Harkis, with their Arab names and Muslim 
religion, are the unwitting victims of the anti-Arab feeling that has increased 
here, fanned by the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are rejected by the French as Arabs, and by the Algerians as traitors," 
Dahak's son Hocime, 25, said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 years after the war, the conflict and the Harkis' integration remain 
sensitive topics in France. 
</P>
<P>
On their arrival in France the Harkis were usually put in "temporary" barracks 
away from or on the edge of towns, reinforcing their isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Often illiterate or lacking employment qualifications, many were given jobs as 
forestry workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Though we are French citizens, we are only considered French before elections, 
or when it's time to do our military service. Otherwise, we are ignored," 
Hocime said. 
</P>
<P>
He lives with his mother, brothers and sisters in the "camp" near Jouques, 
which, with 60 families, is one of the biggest Harki communities in France. 
</P>
<P>
The barracks and apartment building are an eyesore in this beautiful 
countryside dominated by pine forests, lavender fields and vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly is a problem in Jouques," said Mayor Georges Honorat. "The 
authorities now recognize that the situation cannot continue. A committee has 
been formed and funds allocated to resorb the camp in two to three years." 
</P>
<P>
Successive French governments have tried to deal with the Harki problem, but in 
the words of Bernard Tricot, the late President Charles de Gaulle's adviser 
during the last stages of the war, these efforts have often been clumsy and 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
In August the government adopted another plan to set up training programs, 
encourage the creation of small businesses, and improve housing conditions for 
the Harkis. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it's not always easy to help them," said Honorat. "We found many of 
them jobs when the nearby motorway was being built, but after a while they just 
stopped turning up for work. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they want to leave the camp, but they change their minds when offered 
the chance to do so." 
</P>
<P>
"Our parents are too old to move now," Hocime countered. "They are used to it 
here. Most of all, we want them to have their dignity back, which means being 
properly housed where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Harkis in this region are better off than elsewhere in France, 
they are still struggling for a place in French society. 
</P>
<P>
"They paid with their blood for the right to be French," said Tahar Rahal, the 
regional council's delegate for Harki affairs here. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, they are rejected or ignored. Their difficulties have quadrupled with 
the increase in racial tension in France, and the problems caused by 
immigration," he said.

Cindy's husband roused their sleeping 12-year-old son at midnight. "You're the 
first one that's going to die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Cindy and her three kids left the beatings, the threats, the daily 
violence of her crazy-jealous husband forever. After 16 years of marriage, of 
control so complete she lost herself, Cindy found the courage to face freedom.

"I thank God I'm free," said Cindy, who didn't want her real name used for fear 
that her husband will find her. "I'm home, with my kids." 
</P>
<P>
The two-bedroom apartment they share is an experiment in independence for 
battered women, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation: permanent 
homes with social services downstairs. Its official opening was in September. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 4 million Cindys each year in America, according to the 
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Every 15 seconds, a woman is 
beaten. Every six hours, a woman is murdered by her husband or boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Still, women stay with their abusers, because a violent home often seems better 
than no home at all. And that is the choice. 
</P>
<P>
The sad truth is that battering causes homelessness. A Victim Services Agency 
study showed that 35% of women living in city homeless shelters were there to 
escape men who beat them. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect yourself and care for yourself, you have to let go of 
everything: friends, family, furniture, clothing," said social worker Olosunde 
Johnson, who is helping these women face the future. "Things that you love, 
that have emotional value to you. And you have to walk out and leave that. And 
there's something wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy left and lived in a shelter for battered women, one of 1,700 serving 
20,000 cities nationwide. The National Domestic Violence Hotline receives 
108,000 calls a year, about one-third of which request shelter. But the need 
far outstrips the available space. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County grand jury found last year that 90% of the battered women 
and children who sought safety were turned away. In Washington, D.C., eight in 
10 women are told there is no room. Advocates believe the situation is similar 
in New York, Chicago and other big cities. 
</P>
<P>
"And then, after 90 days, you have to be uprooted again. This is victimization 
after victimization," Johnson said. "It just keeps eating away at the women and 
the children. 'Who am I?' is a question that comes up. 'Who am I?' " 
</P>
<P>
The victimization stops at the glass doors on a residential street in Brooklyn, 
the ones that lead to these 16 apartments. Permanent homes, ones the women and 
their children leave of their own free will and return to, feeling safe. 
</P>
<P>
"This man used to tell me when to go to bed, when to take a bath, when to get 
up, five minutes to go to the store, and after five minutes, there would have 
been a beating or a fight," Cindy, 33, said. "Now it's just me and the kids. 
Nobody to say: 'No, you can't go, or if you go, I'm going to hit you.' And it's 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates say this permanent housing, which cost $1.7 million over 18 months to 
develop, is the logical conclusion in the evolution of services for battered 
women. In the early '70s, people would open their private homes for abused 
women and their kids. Emergency shelters followed, where women could stay for 
up to three months. 
</P>
<P>
It soon became clear that it took more than 90 days to reorder a life. So 
transitional housing was born, which allowed stays of a year or 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Even that was not enough. The economy was changing; living costs were soaring 
in big cities like New York, and the result was that during the 1980s, battered 
women were increasingly returning to the men who abused them simply because 
they couldn't afford not to. 
</P>
<P>
"And the thing that was different was housing," said Lucy Friedman, executive 
director of Victim Services Agency, the independent, nonprofit group that 
created the housing with the Urban Coalition. "It got down to going back to an 
abusive partner or going to a welfare hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Now these women are home for good. The social services, provided by Johnson, 
will be here for 18 months. There is a support group for the women and another 
for their children. Johnson works on getting child care, enrolling the kids and 
the women in school, helping them achieve their career goals. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's desk is in the basement, but her heart is with the women. She has 
been there, and that helps her maintain her faith that these women will come as 
far as she has. 
</P>
<P>
"It also helps me in identifying what's going on with them, even when they're 
unable to identify it," she said. "And it helps me to love them, even when 
they're unlovable." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Jennifer gets that way, comes downstairs acting like a fool. Leaves 
the tidy, three-bedroom apartment she shares with her two daughters and young 
son, and vents some of the anger and depression that comes of growing up abused 
with 10 brothers and sisters, then being abused for two years by a 
crack-addicted husband, and being a crack addict herself. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer bounced from shelter to shelter for more than a year, her children in 
tow, fighting urges to smoke crack again, to drink herself into oblivion, to 
kill herself and be done with it all. She left her husband for her children's 
sake, but the injustice of having to walk out that door still galls her. 
</P>
<P>
"I left my own apartment. Not his. Mine! He is the one who had my apartment 
when I was in the streets, including the nights he put me in the streets," the 
26-year-old said. "Cold, freezing outside with my children. Five or six in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
She left once and returned once. She left again, almost returned again but 
thought better of it. Not being involved with the batterer is one of the 
criteria for renting one of these heavily subsidized apartments. That, and 
being drug and alcohol-free, and being motivated to move ahead with life. Being 
willing to learn how to act independently without fear. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer and Cindy are doing their best. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally felt safe, that I could sleep and walk the street without 
somebody yelling or doing something, then I started thinking: 'I want a home 
for my children,' " Cindy said. "I always told them: 'I'm going to get you a 
better home.' 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God I did. Now we have everything." 
</P>
<P>
The National Domestic Violence Hotline number is 1-(800)-333-SAFE (7233).

WASHINGTON / CATHERINE COLLINS; 
</P>
<P>
MASSIVE TAX LOOPHOLE COMES DOWN TO JUST TWO LITTLE WORDS: LET'S SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the tortuous cycles of tax reform, Congress has closed loophole after 
loophole and imposed new taxes in the effort to reduce the national deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But if you still want to swap two red cat's eyes for a couple of aggies and a 
green shooter, no one at the Internal Revenue Service will give you more than a 
glance. The same is true if you exchange an apartment building for farmland, or 
a strip shopping mall for an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
These "swaps," or "like-kind" or "tax-deferred" exchanges, have survived, at 
least for now, and they have become a big business in California. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the nickname, they are officially known as Section 1031 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. Like-kind exchanges can apply to almost anything other 
than your home and stocks and bonds. But they are primarily used as a means to 
dispose of, and acquire, new residential, commercial or industrial real estate 
while deferring the tax on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Section 1031 is one of the oldest sections of the code -- dating to the 1920s 
-- and probably has its roots in the agricultural community. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax provisions allowing swaps probably made a lot of sense in the 1920s, 
when there wasn't a lot of cash in the system," said Adam Handler, an attorney 
with the Los Angeles firm Sidley &amp; Austin and a former tax counsel at the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, let's say there were two farmers. One needed a larger tract in 
the back end of his property and (the other) needed some new frontage," Handler 
said. "Well, they could just trade deeds and they were just exchanging 
like-kind properties. There was no cash involved. So you can argue that they 
haven't really changed their investments and that it is not a proper moment for 
taxation. They probably wouldn't have had the cash to pay tax anyway." 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, like-kind exchanges were used primarily by the most intrepid 
taxpayers because the exchanges had to be simultaneous. A 1979 court decision, 
Starker vs. United States, changed that. 
</P>
<P>
Starker sold valuable timberland but refused to accept any money from his 
buyer, only a contract establishing a future exchange. The contract gave 
Starker five years to locate new property, at which point the timberland buyer 
would use the money to purchase the new land and give to Starker. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS challenged the arrangement, but a U.S. Court of Appeals found in 
Starker's favor. Many variations of such exchanges have become popular over the 
years because of some fine-tuning of the legislation and increases in the 
capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
At least half the real estate transactions in California are actually 
exchanges, according to Richard L. Sevin, president of a Los Angeles company 
that specializes in such transactions, American Deferred Exchange Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of the like-kind exchange is simple. "It is one of the few remaining 
devices in the internal revenue code to defer tax," said Howard Levine, a 
partner at the Washington law firm Roberts &amp; Holland. "If there were a 
substantial capital gains differential, there might be less interest in the 
tax-deferred exchange." 
</P>
<P>
This is how it works: If you sell for $1 million a building purchased for 
$100,000, you would pay a 28% capital gains tax, or $250,000, on your $900,000 
gain. If, however, you intend to reinvest in a similar property, you can avoid 
the tax by having your buyer deposit the money with an independent third party, 
allowing you to literally swap your property for another. 
</P>
<P>
Congress in 1984 required that the third party not be related to you and that 
you identify the new property within 45 days and close the deal within 180 
days. Also, the new property must be equal to, or greater in value, than the 
old property. One damper on the deal: In California, property tax assessments 
often rise dramatically when land changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
There has been talk in Congress over the years of eliminating the provisions 
allowing these transactions. But even this year, as legislators struggled to 
slash the deficit, it remained intact despite estimates by federal officials 
that it cost the Treasury $500 million a year to subsidize like-kind exchanges. 
However, Sevin estimated that it costs the government that much annually in 
California alone. 
</P>
<P>
An insider says that the provisions seem fairly safe in the Senate, where the 
real estate lobby is particularly powerful. Any possible change is likely to 
emerge from the House Ways and Means Committee, where other constituencies are 
just as powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Levine argued that many of these deals would not be done without Section 1031. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a loophole because it clearly was intentional," Handler said. "It 
is not a glitch in the tax code, although it may be a dinosaur. Personally, I 
think it will die a death of a thousand cuts. . . . There will be a huge hue 
and cry from the real estate industry, but it will get smaller and smaller and 
apply to less and less." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Health Benefits for Retirees 
</P>
<P>
Big firms won a quiet but potentially substantial victory when Congress 
approved changes that will allow employers to pay health benefits for retirees 
with money from surplus pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition that included AT&amp;T, DuPont, Pacific Telesis Group and Pacific 
Gas &amp; Electric lobbied hard for the new rule. Under the change, assets 
greater than what is required to meet a pension plan's obligations can be used, 
under certain conditions, to pay health benefits for retired workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unions and other advocates for pension recipients, such as the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons, fought the move. They argued that surplus pension funds 
should be used to improve the benefits of workers and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
But pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit gave the employers the boost 
they needed to win. The change is expected to save the Treasury $1 billion over 
five years because the excess pension funds will be used to pay retiree health 
benefits that otherwise would have been funded with tax-deductible corporate 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the employers were forced to accept some restrictions. Companies that 
terminate pension plans to grab the excess funds for other purposes, called a 
reversion, face an excise tax on the surplus of up to 50%, a whopping increase 
from the previous 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been better had the reversion proposal not passed, but the other 
side retreated from their position of requiring cost-of-living adjustments and 
other benefits to retirees which had not been promised or earned," said Mark J. 
Ugoretz, president of the ERISA Industry Committee, which represents the 
nation's 125 largest firms. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), chairman of a Senate subcommittee that 
oversees pension matters, vowed to scrutinize the pension transfers to pay 
health benefits. In the coming year, Metzenbaum, the Senate's chief pension 
watchdog, also expects to examine whether the Department of Labor is doing a 
good job of enforcing pension laws to protect workers and retirees.

BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: TAKING THE LONG VIEW, THE OUTLOOK FOR 
U.S. IS BRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY WEIDENBAUM, MURRAY WEIDENBAUM is director of the Center for the Study 
of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis and is author of 
Rendezvous With Reality: The American Economy After Reagan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1981, it has become fashionable for Republicans to praise the incumbent 
President for all the good things that happen in the American economy while he 
is in office. Simultaneously, Democrats have attacked the occupants of the 
White House for all the negatives that have arisen. 
</P>
<P>
Both approaches share a common shortcoming: They implicitly credit government 
and especially the presidency with awesome powers over the economy. But our 
private enterprise system derives its strength from the fact that most decision 
making is decentralized. Under these circumstances, let us undertake a more 
modest task: a midterm review of the American economy during the presidency of 
George Bush, including a look at the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
It is instructive to describe the conditions under which Ronald Reagan's 
presidency ended as a prelude to evaluating more recent developments. 
Reaganomics was the most ambitious reform effort in the United States since 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Its legacy is a fascinating mixture: lower 
inflation and higher budget deficits, less unemployment and larger trade 
deficits, fewer strikes and more government jobs, the deepest recession in half 
a century and the longest peacetime recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Bush assumed the presidency in a lower key than Reagan did 
eight years earlier. Unlike 1981, there was little desire to undo the policies 
of his predecessor. The Bush Administration has focused much of its attention 
on incremental changes in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the Bush Administration and Congress have jointly 
attempted to wrestle seriously with the huge federal budget deficits. That has 
been obscured by the messy way in which the decisions were reached. There is no 
need to endorse every part of the recent budget compromise, however. I would 
have preferred far more emphasis on cutting spending and less attention to tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
There was little debate over the need to reduce the deficits; no one on either 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue could defend the fiscal status quo. Instead, the 
deliberations focused on specific tax increases (e.g., on gasoline) and 
specific spending programs reduction (e.g., in Medicare). 
</P>
<P>
The bad news, as cynics quickly point out, is that the deficit continues to 
rise. The combination of savings and loan bailouts and a weak economy is 
pushing the Treasury's annual borrowing to the neighborhood of $300 billion. 
Fiscally, that is a rough neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Economic forecasting today requires a special blend of heroism. In addition to 
analyzing trends in the economies of many nations, it is necessary to make a 
prognostication concerning military actions in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A successful conclusion to the Middle East crisis would bolster business and 
consumer confidence and contribute to economic expansion. If the standoff 
continues, any upturn will be more moderate, as would the Federal Reserve's 
response to a soft economy. Of course, an extended shooting war would force 
forecasters back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Because these military developments do not show up in the clearest crystal 
ball, it is more useful to concentrate on matters beyond the current business 
cycle. The advent of the first recession in eight years is hardly a time to 
extol the economic policy of a sitting President. Without downplaying the pain 
that arises during downturns in the economy, let us look across the valley to 
the next recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Four factors make for continuing long-term strength in the American economy. In 
a burst of nonpartisanship, I do not assign Bush exclusive responsibility for 
these positive trends: 
</P>
<P>
* The transition from Cold War to Hot Peace. Recent events in the Mideast 
underscore the stubborn fact that we live in a dangerous world. Despite the 
buildup of force in Saudi Arabia, the pace of military contract awards in the 
United States continues downward. The reduction in defense jobs for highly 
skilled people is initially painful. But the return of these vital resources to 
the civilian economy will provide the opportunity for investing them in 
productivity-enhancing activities. 
</P>
<P>
* The shift to private sector research and development. For the entire 
post-World War II period, the federal government was the primary R&amp;D 
decision maker in the United States by virtue of financing most of the projects 
to be undertaken and choosing who would do the work. Since 1981, however, the 
amount of money spent by the private sector to finance R&amp;D has exceeded the 
government's outlays. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, most R&amp;D now performed in the United States is sponsored by business 
to meet its needs and, ultimately, consumer demands. As a result, the 1990s are 
bound to witness improved production processes and a heightened flow of new 
civilian products. 
</P>
<P>
* The restructuring of American business. In response to foreign competition 
and domestic takeover threats, many companies have restructured and downsized 
their operations. Simultaneously, they are giving new attention to quality 
production of the items they sell. The upshot is a reduction in the cost of 
producing goods in the United States. A substantial depreciation in the value 
of the dollar since 1985 has reinforced this trend and is making American goods 
more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
* The second Renaissance of Western Europe. Industrialized nations are the best 
customers of other industrialized nations. Thus, the economic integration of 
the European Community by the end of 1992 (EC-92) is creating enhanced market 
opportunities for American firms. 
</P>
<P>
Strong U.S. firms with established presences in the EC will do well. Many 
European companies, no longer protected by national trade or regulatory 
barriers, fear that this new competition from the larger, better capitalized 
and higher-tech U.S. firms. Moreover, the American companies tend to have more 
experience in selling to continentwide markets. 
</P>
<P>
A great many small and medium-size American companies, however, are unprepared 
for EC-92. Their unanticipated new competitors probably will be the larger and 
more productive European companies that will enjoy economies of scale in 
serving the expanding EC marketplace. Fewer than half of all American companies 
have heard of EC-92. Of those that have, only a modest portion have established 
strategic plans to respond, either offensively or defensively. 
</P>
<P>
In the larger perspective, we can anticipate that -- like Japanese competition 
in the auto market -- a more virulent band of European competitors will force 
American companies into another round of productivity-enhancing actions. 
</P>
<P>
In short, although Congress has not outlawed recessions, short-term problems 
should not cloud the economy's bright long-term skies.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SIDESTEP PROBATE WITH A REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I own a house that my deceased husband and I purchased in 1953 for less than 
$19,000. The deed is in my name alone, but I would like to add the names of my 
two children. I was told that if they were listed as joint tenants, my house 
could be attached if either child were held liable for an accident and the 
value of the house were needed to cover their obligations. Is there some way to 
list them on the deed without such problems? I want the house to go to them 
upon my death as simply as possible. -- D.D.I 
</P>
<P>
A: Many senior citizens are under the mistaken impression that listing their 
heirs on the titles to their property is the best solution to all their 
apprehensions about probate and inheritance. Actually, you may be far better 
off keeping title to your house as it is and pursuing another course. 
</P>
<P>
What are your choices? The hands-down favorite among many financial planners 
and attorneys for those in your circumstances is the revocable living trust. 
Simply speaking, these arrangements allow taxpayers to place their assets in 
trust for their heirs. Upon the trust holder's death, the assets are passed on 
to the heirs without the often costly and time-consuming probate process. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant benefits of these trusts is that they give the 
assets placed in them a "stepped-up" value as of the date of the trust holder's 
death. For example, if your house is worth $300,000 when you die, that is the 
tax basis value assigned to it when it passes to your heirs. Should they sell 
the property later for $350,000, tax would be assessed on the $50,000 
difference. If you had simply added your two children to the deed, their 
one-third shares of the home would have a tax basis calculated from the home's 
original price. If the home cost $60,000, their basis would be $20,000 each. 
Quite a difference from the "stepped-up" value available through the trust. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular feature of the revocable living trust is its provision that 
allows you to name your heirs as co-trustees of your trust, which would allow 
them to manage your assets for your benefit should you become incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
This is only a quick outline of the advantages offered by these trusts. As you 
probably can guess, such trusts are not cheap. You can probably expect to pay 
your lawyer at least $1,000 for a relatively simple -- but complete -- trust 
agreement. You are well advised to consult your family attorney, accountant or 
financial planner. You may also want to read more about these trusts in one of 
the many estate planning books available in libraries and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No IRS Break on Home-Sale Rule 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently sold my home in California and entered medical school in Chicago. 
I had a $100,000 gain on the sale and will use these proceeds to finance my 
education and internship. I will be unable to buy another house for at least 
five years. Is there any way I can get around the IRS law requiring you to 
re-invest home sale profits within two years or pay taxes on them? I feel I 
have special circumstances and should be given a waiver. -- M.D.B.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, the IRS does not grant waivers to the two-year tax deferral. You must 
either buy a home of equal or greater value than the one you sold within two 
years of the sale, or pay income taxes on your profit. No exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Check on Annuity Issuers 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am thinking about buying an annuity and know I should check out the 
company issuing it quite carefully. How do I do that? -- H.H.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several sources for information about annuities and the life 
insurance companies issuing them. Perhaps the best known rating service is A. 
M. Best, which regularly publishes its own insurance company ratings. Similar 
evaluations are also published by Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Dunn &amp; 
Phelps. These publications are often carried in public libraries. Your stock 
broker no doubt has them as well. 
</P>
<P>
Your financial planner, stock brokerage, banker and life insurance salesman -- 
your most likely source for buying an annuity -- should be able to provide the 
information you need to make a wise selection. Your job, however, is to be sure 
that you receive the impartial analysis that you need to evaluate your 
potential purchase. If you want to know the A. M. Best rating and evaluation of 
the life insurance company issuing the annuity, don't buy the annuity until you 
receive the report. But beware; much of the information in Best reports and 
other ratings is often months old, and subsequent events in today's fast-moving 
financial world may have undermined the safety of an institution and its 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figuring Income Tax on Old Split Shares 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1914, my wife's grandfather gave her three shares of stock then valued at 
$3 each. Over the years, the stock split three times, and by the time we sold 
it earlier this year, we had 24 shares valued at $71.50 each. We received 
$1,716 from the sale and are trying to figure out how much tax we owe. What is 
our taxable basis in the shares? Is it $3 per share for each of the 24 shares 
for a total of $72, or the value on the days the shares split, or is it just a 
tax-free gift? -- K.C.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Our tax experts say your basis is the price the donor paid. We will assume 
that your wife's grandfather paid $3 per share. That puts your taxable basis in 
the stock at a total of $9 -- three shares at $3 each -- and your taxable gain 
at $1,707, minus your selling costs.

WHY NOT GIVE A GIFT THAT'S ALSO AN INVESTMENT?

<P>
The long Thanksgiving weekend marks the traditional kickoff of the holiday 
shopping season. If you dread the thought of crowded malls, shudder at the idea 
of having to return items that don't fit or simply don't know what to buy, how 
about presenting a mutual fund as a gift? 
</P>
<P>
You can invest in any of several dozen funds for as little as $250. Some will 
accept minimum investments of $100, $50 or even less. At those prices, you 
probably wouldn't want to buy a mutual fund for the office gift exchange, but 
the idea makes sense for a close friend or relative, especially a child. 
</P>
<P>
You can, of course, make this sort of gift at any time. Common occasions 
include graduations and births. "But interest seems to pick up around the 
holidays," says Virginia Marans, a spokeswoman for the Franklin Group of Funds 
in San Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
For relatively small amounts of money, it's usually much wiser to make a gift 
of mutual funds rather than common stock. That's because funds are 
professionally managed and diversified, so the person who receives one doesn't 
have to follow it closely. Also, dividends can be reinvested easily -- a 
feature not offered by all corporations that issue stock. 
</P>
<P>
And you pay lower transaction costs when making a small investment in a mutual 
fund. Try buying $100 worth of common shares without incurring at least $25 or 
$30 in brokerage commissions, plus another $25 or $30 when you sell. 
</P>
<P>
You can give a mutual fund to another adult, such as a friend or your spouse, 
but you need to obtain that person's signature when completing the application. 
"Because the adult recipient must sign, your gift would lose the element of 
surprise," Marans says. 
</P>
<P>
The signature is needed for tax reasons -- to verify that the person's Social 
Security number is correct. But when giving a fund to your child or grandchild, 
this problem can be avoided because you can certify that child's number. 
</P>
<P>
There's another good reason to give to a child. The younger the person, the 
more time his or her investment has to grow. Suppose you choose a fund that 
increases at an average rate of 9% annually after taxes. Ten years from now,, 
your gift of $250 would be worth about $592, provided the fund continues to 
appreciate by 9%. If the investment stayed put for 60 years, it would swell to 
$44,008, assuming the same growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this can make a big impact not only on the kid's pocketbook but also 
on the kid himself. "When you introduce the magic of compounding to a young 
child, there's an educational factor involved," says Gunnar Hughes, spokesman 
for the Twentieth Century Investors fund family in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest way to hold assets in a child's name is through a custodial account 
under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. There's no extra paper work 
involved. All you have to do is designate this option when completing a 
standard mutual fund application. As custodian, you (or the adult you choose) 
will retain control over the investment until the child reaches the age of 
majority -- 18 in California. 
</P>
<P>
On small accounts, income taxes usually will be levied at the child's lower 
rate. If his assets generate less than $500 in unearned income a year, there 
might not be any tax liability. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century has a unique fund called Giftrust that allows nothing but 
gifts. In fact, you can't open an account for yourself or your spouse, although 
you can give one to anyone else. Federal and state taxes are paid directly out 
of the account by Twentieth Century, which serves as trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century requires each Giftrust account to remain in place for a 
minimum of 10 years. A child can't touch the money until he reaches the age of 
majority, and even adult recipients can't get to it if the donor specifies a 
lengthier time frame. 
</P>
<P>
"The fund is popular with grandparents because it allows them to be remembered 
for a long time, even after they pass away," says Hughes, who adds that 
Giftrust accounts are most commonly opened for newborn babies. "We also see a 
lot of interest around the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a custodian account, this fund is offered as an irrevocable trust that 
can't be changed or canceled by the donor. However, that person may make 
additional investments from time to time -- although the recipient can't. 
</P>
<P>
Because Giftrust's portfolio managers can count on a stable asset base, without 
having to worry about sudden redemptions, they tend to buy long-term stakes in 
smaller growth stocks. Since recipients can't redeem for a minimum of 10 years, 
they're forced to stay invested through thick and thin -- an advantage during a 
long-term market up-trend. 
</P>
<P>
Giftrust ($250 minimum, no load, 800-345-2021) is a volatile performer, having 
dropped 14% in 1984 and 24% during the first 10 months of this year. On the 
other hand, it surged 55% in 1985 and 50% in '89. "It's our most aggressive 
fund," Hughes says. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to give a mutual fund and have an account statement in hand by 
Christmas Eve, call the fund company and request an application no later than 
early December, because the process generally takes a week or two, depending on 
mail delivery. (You can reduce the time involved by buying through a broker or 
financial planner.) Jewish investors will have to move a bit faster, 
considering that Hanukkah starts Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming you decide to give a mutual fund to a child, keep in mind that he or 
she might be a bit disappointed initially. But unlike presents that break, wear 
out or become obsolete, this one will probably grow more valuable over the 
years. As it does and as the child matures, your gift will be increasingly 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOW-MINIMUM MARVELS 
</P>
<P>
Of the couple of dozen stock-oriented mutual funds that accept investments of 
$100 or less, the following have some of the best long-term track records. 
These funds also have low subsequent minimums, a feature that makes it easy to 
keep adding money to your account if you choose.

RETAILERS ARE CRYING 'WOLF' TOO SOON; PUBLIC ISN'T IN THE MOOD YET FOR 
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story, "Shoppers Curtail Buying: Christmas Sales May Fizzle" (Nov. 9), is 
flagrantly premature. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, retailers annoyingly push Christmas earlier. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't even Thanksgiving yet, for heaven's sake! Already stores are festooned 
with Christmas decorations -- the potted fake poinsettias and holly wreaths 
will be limp and dusty by the time Christmas arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers cannot expect the festive and giving spirit of Christmas to last for 
weeks on end -- anticipation has a limited attention span. Instead of the fun 
of either well-planned or spur-of-the-moment gift buying, shoppers are 
encouraged to buy early (and long!), which presents a problem of storage and 
loss of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Then the last few weeks before Christmas are dismal, with continuous sales and 
markdowns that remind the shopper he should have waited. Maybe that is what is 
happening now. Disgusted with the greed of retailers stretching holiday buying 
into a two- or even three-month affair, shoppers are simply holding back until 
the inevitable sales, and until the spirit moves them. And, I do mean the 
Christmas spirit, by the way.

James Flanigan's column, "Clean Air Act Will Fuel New Technologies" (Oct. 31), 
about the benefits of the federal clean air legislation is off base on at least 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial generation of electricity by wind and solar power will not have to 
wait until the next decade as Flanigan predicts. 
</P>
<P>
It has been growing steadily in California during the past decade. In 1989, 
wind energy produced 1% of the state's (the world's eighth-largest economy) 
total energy demand for that year, enough to power a city the size of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial generation of electrical energy by wind power began in 1981. Since 
then, turbine performance, energy production and the number of turbines 
continue to grow, despite the lack of tax incentives or government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Kern counties are recipients of a major portion of this energy. 
During windy days, wind turbines in the Tehachapis produce more than 200 
million watts of electrical power, enough to satisfy demand in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The wind industry is not waiting for clean air legislation as an incentive to 
begin commercial generation. We have been producing electrical energy without 
air pollution for the past decade.

On the morning of Nov. 21, 1980, the sound of sirens stirred Rafael Patino from 
bed. "Usually when you hear sirens, they come and then they go," he said. "But 
these were coming and staying." 
</P>
<P>
When he looked out the window of his 16th-floor room, he realized that the Las 
Vegas MGM Grand Hotel was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up my wife and we got dressed to leave," said Patino, an Irvine sales 
executive. "But when we walked out of the room, we couldn't see anything. The 
hall was pitch black with smoke. My wife and I lost each other for a minute in 
the dark. I called to her and she found me, and we went back into our room." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Patino had brought his room key with him. Many victims, as their 
doors slammed behind them, discovered that they had locked themselves out of 
their only refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, he still has room key 1675 -- a memento that possibly saved 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five people -- 10 from Southern California -- died in the fire that 
turned the opulent, high-rise resort into a suffocating chimney. The second 
most deadly hotel fire in U.S. history -- after a 1946 Atlanta blaze that 
claimed 119 lives -- the MGM Grand fire would leave a lasting mark on both the 
survivors and on American building safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Today, fire codes throughout the country are much stricter because of the MGM 
Grand tragedy. In 1980, many high-rises were not equipped with smoke detectors 
-- much less sprinkler systems. The year after the disaster, both the Nevada 
and California legislatures beefed up state fire ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't prevented survivors from suffering panic attacks over the smell 
of smoke. Or from compulsively looking for fire escapes when they enter strange 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Among those survivors were employees and spouses of Printronex, an Irvine-based 
computer firm that had sent 26 people to a trade show at the MGM Grand. Rafael 
Patino and his wife were among that group. A Printronex manager and his bride, 
who had called the Las Vegas excursion their honeymoon, died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kleist, founder and president of Printronex, believes that the fire left 
psychological scars on his employees and financially hampered his company at a 
time when it was just hitting its stride and for "at least a couple of years 
afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
The fire "was a deep trauma to the company," he said. "My suspicion is that it 
had a deeper effect (on the people) than was obvious on the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rafael Patino: "I was very nervous about small and stupid things for a 
long time after the fire: the smell of a barbecue, lighting the fireplace, 
going to hotels. I don't know if I'll ever completely get over it." 
</P>
<P>
The night before the fire at the 2,076-room 26-floor hotel, a group of 
Printronex employees and spouses went to a late show starring singer Mac Davis. 
Then they visited the MGM Grand's lavish casino. 
</P>
<P>
While hotel guests pulled slot machines and played blackjack, an electrical 
wire shorted in the nearby delicatessen. For hours, a small fire smoldered 
unnoticed inside the wall and ceiling cavity. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m., a ferocious blaze suddenly burst into the kitchen and literally 
chased waitresses and breakfast customers out of the deli. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived a few minutes later, flames already were rocketing 
through the 50,000-square-foot casino, consuming its plastic decor at an 
unstoppable pace. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire traveled at 17 feet per second," recalled Clark County Fire Chief Roy 
L. Parrish. "Four minutes after it exited the deli, it hit the lobby's front 
doors and blew out their glass." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters managed to keep the flames to the first two levels, but the fire's 
lethal byproducts -- smoke and carbon monoxide -- drifted up the elevator 
shafts and air-conditioning ducts. 
</P>
<P>
While a war raged below, all was quiet on the upper floors. Guests peacefully 
slept through the commotion, their rooms unguarded by smoke alarms. 
</P>
<P>
About 8 a.m., they gradually began to awake to the faraway sound of sirens or 
screams. 
</P>
<P>
Trapped inside their room, Rafael and Luz Patino assumed that they would die. 
"We prayed and prepared ourselves for death," he said. "Then we started talking 
about our kids and wondering what would happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, then in their 30s, had a 6-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son 
at home in Irvine. Thinking about their children galvanized the Patinos to 
fight for their lives. "We wanted to be there for them. We said, 'Wait a minute 
-- we are not going to give up,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
They stuffed towels under the door and over vents to block the smoke that had 
started to pour in. They moved furniture and flammables to one corner, hoping 
to preserve a safety zone. 
</P>
<P>
When they yanked off the curtains, they discovered a balcony. "The air outside 
was much better than inside," Rafael Patino said. "A lot of glass was coming 
down (as window panes were broken by hotel guests above them). So we took one 
of the drapes and made a tent and covered ourselves. Some of our friends down 
on the street were waving to us and telling us to stay calm." 
</P>
<P>
There they remained for two hours, embracing one another and exchanging words 
of love. "Even though I have said 'I love you' many times in my life," Rafael 
Patino recalled, "rarely have I said it with such intensity." 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the hallway, Rafael's co-worker Joe Campanella and his wife 
JoAnn -- whose room did not have a balcony -- were gasping for fresh air 
through their smashed window. They had awakened to screams of "Fire! Fire!" 
</P>
<P>
"We turned on the radio and (newscasters) were already on the site giving a 
blow-by-blow account," JoAnn Campanella said. "We tried to phone the desk 
downstairs and didn't get an answer. We didn't know if we were the last people 
left in the hotel, or what." 
</P>
<P>
Once he discovered that they could not escape into the smoky corridor, Joe 
Campanella felt as though "the walls were caving in." He and his wife were not 
as optimistic as the Patinos: "We both thought we were going to die, but 
neither of us confessed that to the other." 
</P>
<P>
They heard an elderly woman yelling for help from the room above them. "She 
couldn't break her window, and the woman she was with had passed out," JoAnn 
Campanella said. "We kept telling her to smash a chair against the window, and 
finally she did. I think we were trying to maintain our sanity by focusing on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Six floors below, Joe Campanella's co-worker Peter Craig and his wife found 
sanctuary in a room with about 10 other people who had accidentally stumbled 
into a relatively smoke-free shelter. 
</P>
<P>
While many of his colleagues huddled in the resort-turned-prison, Printronex 
marketing executive Mel Posin was already out on the street counting heads. He 
and his wife had a room on the 21st-floor next to a stairwell. The middle-aged 
couple quickly located the fire exit and made their long descent. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were going down, a bunch of people came rushing up saying, 'You can't 
get out that way.' Apparently, the door (at the bottom of the stairwell) was 
locked shut," Posin said. "I almost started to turn back, but my wife said, 'To 
heck with it -- the closer we get to the ground floor, the better.' " Just as 
the Posins reached the second floor, a firefighter knocked a hole through the 
wall and helped them through to the loading dock roof. 
</P>
<P>
The Patinos, Campanellas and Craigs had been assigned to comparatively safe 
floors. Sixty of the fire's 85 victims died on the 19th through 24th levels, 
where smoke had risen through the elevator shafts and air-conditioning ducts, 
accumulating in a dense cloud. Only nine of the victims actually burned to 
death -- all in the casino area. 
</P>
<P>
Printronex employee Ed Herring and his wife, Genese, had a room on the 21st 
level. They perished side by side on the floor, asphyxiated by smoke and carbon 
monoxide inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
The previous night, they had teased Mel Posin about his plush suite. "My wife 
and I had a fancy bedroom with a Jacuzzi," Posin recalled. "Ed said, 'It's a 
shame -- you're an old married couple, and here we are newlyweds. We'd really 
make use of this room.' I said, 'Tell you what -- tomorrow we can swap rooms.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Posin instead went to the morgue the next day to identify the Herrings. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Campanella was in her 16th-floor room, looking out her window. "I kept 
watching the ladders and thinking that eventually they would get to us," she 
recalled. Like most people of the era before heightened public awareness on 
fire safety, Campanella wasn't aware that fire ladders extended only to the 
ninth or 10th level of a building. 
</P>
<P>
But a ladder did eventually reach the 10th-floor room in which Peter and 
Patricia Craig waited with others. One by one, the evacuees scrambled over the 
balcony ledge and made their way down 100 feet of rungs -- the ladder's railing 
their sole security. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real long way down, let me tell you," Peter Craig said. "But after 
being cooped up for two hours, we were so relieved to be getting out alive that 
we didn't have any hesitations." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 a.m., rescue workers began banging on 16th-floor doors and guiding 
people to a stairwell. "Up until that point, I guess I had to think I was in 
control," Joe Campanella remembered. "But as soon as the fireman told us, 
'You're OK now -- you can go down,' my knees just turned to jelly and I started 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
At some point after the Patinos had left Room 1675, 50-year-old Sara Galico -- 
a Mexican national visiting Las Vegas on holiday -- stumbled through the open 
door and died next to Mrs. Patino's trade show name tag. 
</P>
<P>
Luz Patino heard on television the startling news that she was a fire victim. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the Hilton (in Las Vegas) that evening watching TV, and they listed 
my wife as a fatality," Rafael Patino said. "It was broadcast all over the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
They had not been able to contact their children and other family members -- so 
their loved ones also heard the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my brother in Arizona to let him know that my wife was not one of the 
victims," Rafael Patino said. Initially, his brother -- thinking that Rafael 
was in shock -- did not believe him. "He said, 'But I heard it on the news.' " 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, the MGM Grand as it stood in 1980 seems a disaster waiting to 
happen: guest rooms unguarded by smoke detectors or sprinklers; a yawning 
hollow above the casino's false ceiling that allowed flames to sweep through 
unchallenged; poorly designed stairwells that sucked smoke into fire escapes. 
</P>
<P>
Only three months after the disaster, a fire at the Las Vegas Hilton took eight 
lives. The Nevada Legislature moved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of those two fires, the state passed a fire code law in 1981 that 
put Nevada in the forefront of fire safety," Nevada State Fire Marshal Rex 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1979 law had mandated sprinkler systems in all new buildings open to the 
public, but the strict new "retrofit law" extended that requirement to existing 
structures. The revised fire-code ordinances also called for such features as 
smoke detectors in rooms and elevators, exit map signs in all hotel rooms, 
limitations on the use of combustible fiberboard, and smoke-detector sensors in 
air-conditioning ducts that would automatically shut down the system to prevent 
smoke circulation. 
</P>
<P>
California similarly reinforced its state fire code -- with one crucial 
omission. An existing sprinkler system ordinance was not changed to affect 
pre-1974 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"While we have some of the best fire safety laws in the nation, we don't have 
the optimum," said California Fire Marshal Jim McMullen. "The resistance to a 
retrofit law is purely economical; sprinkler systems cost an average of about 
$1 million per building." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expense, McMullen hopes that California someday will adopt fire 
laws as stringent as those in Nevada. "There has never been the loss of more 
than one life in a fire that occurred in a high-rise building with sprinklers," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The MGM fire was a significant turning point in the level of fire safety in 
the United States," said Tom Klem, who wrote an investigative report on the 
fire for the National Fire Protection Assn. "Still, it seems as though a 
disaster has to happen in people's own back yard before they'll go that extra 
mile and retroactively mandate sprinklers in high-rises." 
</P>
<P>
Less than eight months after the devastating fire, the MGM Grand reopened -- to 
a full house. "We hired thousands of construction workers who worked 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week," said Fred Benninger, president of MGM Grand Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But the fire continued to take its toll on the hotel. It was hit by heavy legal 
costs -- including a suit filed by the 24 Printronex employees that returned 
them about $50,000 each, according to Mark Robinson Jr., their attorney. MGM 
Grand and various contractors ultimately paid more than $140 million to about 
1,400 victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's operating earnings in fiscal 1984 were $58.9 million, compared to 
$72.1 million in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Bally Manufacturing Corp. acquired the MGM hotels in Las Vegas and 
Reno. Benninger said the sale had nothing to do with the infamous fire. "There 
was no stigma attached to the MGM Grand," he said. "The hotel today is one of 
the most protected in the world. We simply received a very attractive offer 
from Bally." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is now called Bally's Grand. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks after the tragedy, Mel Posin said the mood at his workplace "was very 
solemn." 
</P>
<P>
Printronex president Kleist thinks the fire hurt his employees' performance and 
the company as a whole for at least a couple of years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our top sales and marketing people were at that meeting because it was 
a big trade show," he said. "They were the focus of our company -- the people 
who represented us to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the people who had to travel a lot, and there was a loss of 
enthusiasm (about traveling)." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the Printronex salespeople who survived the fire request 
lower-level hotel rooms when they travel. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I do after I check into a hotel is find the fire 
exits, and then I make sure that all the exit doors (in the stairwells) are 
unlocked," said Rafael Patino, who is the international sales manager for 
Printronex. "Sometimes it's embarrassing because security people look at you 
like, 'What's that guy up to?' " 
</P>
<P>
Posin, who never leaves home without a portable smoke detector, recalled that 
the mood at his workplace "was very solemn" for weeks after the tragedy. "I 
guess that once you've been through an experience like that, it stays with you 
forever," he said. "I fought in World War II, but this was more traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Campanella for years suffered severe panic attacks "at the slightest hint 
of smoke." In recent years, she thought that she had pretty much gotten over 
the trauma -- until a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the television news, and there was (film footage) about a hotel 
fire," she said. "I started crying -- I became hysterical. It was like I was 
living through that fire again. Joe's mom and dad were visiting us, and I'm 
sure they thought I was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Still searching for an end to the tragedy, Rafael Patino felt compelled to 
return to Room 1675 -- where he and his wife thought they would gasp their last 
breath. While on a business trip to Las Vegas five years ago, he stopped by the 
former MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
"I forced myself to walk inside, I forced myself to take the elevator to the 
16th floor," he said. "I found the room and just stood outside the door for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that you can't understand unless you've been through 
it. I had to retrace my steps. It was like finding a piece of me that had been 
lost."

A LITERARY MATCHMAKER IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If MCA maven Jules Stein had had his druthers -- and he generally saw to it 
that he did -- his elder daughter Jean would have become a Hollywood agent. 
</P>
<P>
Not just a Hollywood agent. A wonderful Hollywood agent. 
</P>
<P>
"She had that gift for putting people together, for making things happen, for 
creating an environment or a climate in which people helped each other," says 
Joan Didion, a longtime friend and occasional confidante of the Steins. 
</P>
<P>
But while the formidable Jules Stein was able to move mountains when it came to 
The Industry, he had less luck with his shy, fluttery daughter, who 
nevertheless turned out to be a fairly intractable piece of topography herself. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Stein never did go into her dad's business. But that didn't make Jules 
wrong about his No. 1 daughter. 
</P>
<P>
She is indeed busy mixing and matching people. She's the happy caretaker of one 
of New York's great salons, an Upper West Side abode where she regularly 
collects as eclectic a bunch as she's able to find -- from Dennis Hopper to 
George Plimpton, from Jasper Johns to James Watson of DNA-discovering fame. 
</P>
<P>
And now, ever the populist, she's pouring her unlikely matchmaking fervor into 
Grand Street, considered one of the country's most distinguished literary 
magazines. With the current issue, Stein assumes her place as Grand Street's 
grande dame, and under her tutelage, the magazine reads like the literary 
equivalent of a splendid dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
Here she has collected the poet Bei Dao, an exiled leader of China's democracy 
movement, and she matches him up with Olivier Messiaen, who weighs in with a 
snippet of score from "Saint Francoise d'Assise," the composer's only opera. 
There are literary heavyweights the likes of Elizabeth Bishop and John Ashbery. 
But there's also ice-hockey arena owner-operator-cum-poet Matt Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he's going to name his child after me, poor guy," Stein says of her 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
That lineup doesn't even include the artist Saul Steinberg, who contributed a 
portfolio of zoned-out dog drawings and antique dog postcards as well as the 
jazzy cover. Or Lewis Thomas, president emeritus of New York's prominent 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who offers up a handy-dandy scientific 
essay, "The World at a Glance." 
</P>
<P>
"I am very interested in these different worlds coming together, so you're not 
only writing, you're not only art, you're not only science, you're bringing 
them all together," says Stein, 56. "And, in a way, I've lived my life in New 
York that way. I'm probably one of the very few people who brings people from 
different worlds to have evenings at home. So it's a natural." 
</P>
<P>
Says Hopper: "She's very generous, and I'm not saying by giving people loans, 
but as a person, intellectually. She's extremely curious, and she goes out and 
she seeks out people. She seeks out experiences." 
</P>
<P>
When Stein talks about her latest venture, her voice sounds girlish. Her words 
come out in a breathy rush, tumbling over each other as a new thought overtakes 
an old one midstream. Now she's talking about what a shame it is that the work 
of foreign writers under 40, uncommercial as it is, so rarely sees the light of 
print in this country, and how she plans to correct that in Grand Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's important," she says. "The world is becoming smaller and 
smaller, and with some American writers, there's a danger of provincialism. So 
much I find of American fiction today is studying one's navel. There is more 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
And she says that it's wonderful to have the Ashberys and the Bishops, the 
celebrities of the literary world, but there's nothing quite like squaring them 
off with a talented unknown or three. 
</P>
<P>
Rather like the way she arranges her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to end up living in that world, which is where I could easily 
be," says Stein. "The celebrity world, it's death finally. There are no ideas 
coming in any more." 
</P>
<P>
The rebel with the literary magazine, charmed as she is by incongruities, would 
be pleased to know that her tony quarterly made a mass-market appearance in a 
recent issue of People magazine, in a photo featuring her old friend Dennis 
Hopper. Hopper also appears in Grand Street itself, in a pastiche of interviews 
Stein published about some drugged-out days Hopper spent with writer Terry 
Southern at Larry Flynt's palace, listening to Timothy Leary and G. Gordon 
Liddy howl at each other for their pseudo-debates, passing pot to Flynt's wife 
and watching Flynt do a Hustler shoot delicately titled "Celebrity Porn." 
</P>
<P>
"I did meet Larry Flynt once," Stein muses. "Dennis arranged for me to meet 
him. I was just terrorized." 
</P>
<P>
Tales of Stein's adventures fail to ruffle her daughters Katrina and Wendy 
Vanden Heuvel, a 31-year-old Nation editor and 29-year-old San Francisco 
actress, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"They're used to me by now," Stein says cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
Stein raised $100,000 for her first issue (with a press run of 10,000) from 
Grand Street well-wishers who included Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner and 
Stephen Graham, a Washington Post scion, theater producer and budding novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Stein, a longtime literary philanthropist, is also helping pay the 
bills with contributions funneled through the New York Foundation of the Arts. 
And the eight-room apartment on Central Park West where she raised her children 
and spent the last quarter-century is now totally transformed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a home any more," she says. "Sometimes there are eight people working 
in there. The dining room is no longer a dining room. It's like a campaign 
headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
Stein inherited the 9-year-old magazine from its founder, Ben Sonnenberg, who 
started it with the proceeds from the sale of his ancestral home at 19 Gramercy 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Being quite the rabble-rouser himself, Sonnenberg prided himself on bucking the 
tradition of literary magazines by paying writers real money, up to $2,000 a 
pop and sometimes even more. Stein says she plans to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
And if it's true that you get what you pay for, Sonnenberg did well to open his 
pockets. Over the years, he published such writers as Samuel Beckett, Garry 
Wills, Christopher Hitchens and Alexander Cockburn. And he liked to say he 
named the magazine Grand Street, because that was where his parents met in New 
York. (His father, Ben Sonnenberg Sr., was a public-relations lion.) 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenberg retired because multiple sclerosis was beginning to get the better 
of him, and because he wanted to write his memoirs. "Lost Property: Memoirs and 
Confessions of a Bad Boy" will be published by Summit Books next spring. 
</P>
<P>
As for his choice of Stein as successor, Sonnenberg, in his typically wry way, 
says this of his old friend: "I had been meant to marry Jean when we were in 
our 20s, because she was the daughter of a man with a great collection of 
English 18th-Century furniture. And my father had a great collection of English 
18th-Century furniture. And he thought it would be swell if the two collections 
could merge. 
</P>
<P>
"So this is the fulfillment of a dream of my father's." 
</P>
<P>
Stein's famous father cast a big shadow over her childhood, and in a way, it's 
where the story of her conception of the magazine begins. She grew up in a 
majestic house on Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills that overlooked Rudolph 
Valentino's home, Falcon's Lair. (Rupert Murdoch later bought the Steins' 
mansion.) 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," Stein recalls. "You really had a sense of privacy, being 
alone. It was kind of lonely, too." 
</P>
<P>
Stein was hemmed in by two strong-willed parents and a German governess, who 
were not fond of children having their own opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"You were supposed to do what you were told," Stein recalls. "I guess you 
become rebellious to survive." 
</P>
<P>
She was eventually shipped off to the Katharine Branson School in San 
Francisco, which was strict -- "I always liked to say it was located between 
San Quentin and Alcatraz." 
</P>
<P>
And later to a school in Lausanne, Switzerland, which was not -- "They only 
made a law after you broke it. But it was freedom. It was heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Stein later went to Wellesley College, but she dropped out and moved to Paris, 
where she studied at the Sorbonne and joined forces with her friend George 
Plimpton at the Paris Review in the mid-'50s. While she was in Paris, she met 
William Faulkner, who did double duty as a successful suitor and her first 
published interview subject. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare and provocative coming out, Faulkner talked about art, Hollywood and 
bourbon, informing readers of the Paris Review that "the best job that was ever 
offered to me was to become a landlord in a brothel. In my opinion it's the 
perfect milieu for an artist to work in." 
</P>
<P>
"He said it was the first time he had ever spoken seriously about his work," 
Stein says. "Usually he would say to people, 'I'm just a farmer.' He was a very 
great man. He had great values, and I think growing up in Hollywood is not the 
best place for values. And I was a lost soul." 
</P>
<P>
In the late '50s, Stein worked in New York as an assistant to Clay Felker, then 
features editor of Esquire Magazine. But it was as an interviewer that Stein 
found her metier. By the early '60s, she was married to socialite William 
Vanden Heuvel. (They later divorced.) And when he was appointed a special 
assistant to then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy, they moved to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, Stein's interests were largely confined to the arts, and Kennedy 
liked to chastise her for her tunnel vision, reminding her that there was a big 
political world out there. 
</P>
<P>
And when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, she rode his funeral train from St. 
Patrick's in New York to Arlington National Cemetery in Washington. It was a 
life-turning event for Stein, prompting her to conduct years of interviews that 
resulted in a 1971 oral history edited by Plimpton, "American Journey: The 
Times of Robert Kennedy." The book, structured as a series of recollections 
pegged to different stages of the funeral journey, was warmly praised by the 
New Yorker, which called it "serious, credible, and even beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Stein published "Edie: An American Biography," another lauded oral 
history edited by Plimpton. This one was about California blueblood and Andy 
Warhol "youthquaker" Edie Sedgwick, whose troubled life ended in a drug 
overdose in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Stein had known Edie, and considered her sort of "a younger sister." And she 
spent 10 relentless years on interviews for the book, returning to some 
subjects as many as 15 times. A friend liked to say that you'd think Stein was 
in a wind tunnel, she was so single-minded in her pursuit of people. 
</P>
<P>
Now Stein has turned back to Hollywood for her next book, and her Larry Flynt 
piece is a small excerpt of it. It will be something about how the Old 
Hollywood meets the New Hollywood, and she's been interviewing another diverse 
bunch, from filmmaker King Vidor to her parents' butler for 25 years, Charles 
Harris, who had previously worked at San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
But Stein doesn't limit herself to books any more, ever since the completion of 
"Edie" left her with "a really serious postpartum." 
</P>
<P>
"Starting the magazine gave me, even though I was already working on my next 
book, it gave me the feeling I wouldn't fall off the precipice again," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
It also gives her a chance to be a rebel, and quite a distinguished one at 
that. Stein is thumbing her nose at those who insist a literary magazine is all 
seriousness, and no fun. She wants to be, well, outrageous, to publish stuff 
about a millionaire porn pusher who employs a big security guard called 
Monstro-Kraut, and say, yeah, that's Literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's iconoclastic instead of outrageous," Stein says thoughtfully. "That 
you have the freedom to rebel. That you can be what you want."

BANK SCARE REMINDS OF GAS DANGER; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: INVESTIGATORS TRACING THE SOURCE OF AN ODOR AT A WELLS FARGO BRANCH 
FIND AN EXPLOSIVE CONCENTRATION OF METHANE, A RECURRENT THREAT IN THE FAIRFAX 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Employees and customers alike had complained for a year about the bad smell at 
the Wells Fargo Bank branch on Fairfax Avenue, where experts finally found an 
explosive concentration of methane gas earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"For long periods of time there was no problem, and then it got to be really 
bad," said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathy Shilkret. 
</P>
<P>
The smell, apparently caused by mildew from water molecules wafted upward by 
the lighter-than-air methane, eventually was traced to an electrical conduit 
that extended from the bank's main business area through the concrete floor 
slab and reached four feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery provided another reminder of the recurrent danger posed by 
methane in the Fairfax area, where deposits of oil and gas lie close to the 
surface. The city imposed a set of safety measures after 21 people were hurt in 
an explosion five years ago, but they have been widely ignored, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residential portions of the area are not generally regarded as being in danger, 
because lawns and gardens allow methane to pass safely into the atmosphere. In 
commercial sections, however, an asphalt cap formed by the streets and parking 
lots of the commercial district can allow concentrations of the gas to reach 
potentially dangerous levels. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said last week the Wells Fargo incident 
suggests that the problem "is more widespread than we thought." The bank office 
lies slightly outside the zone city officials had previously identified as 
having the greatest methane danger. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance requiring detectors and venting has virtually gone ignored, and 
the first fault has got to be that of the property owners," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires that before a commercial property in the methane risk 
zone changes hands, gas detection meters must be installed on the ground floors 
of buildings where there is inadequate ventilation or conditions that might 
produce sparks. 
</P>
<P>
The bank building, which according to county records has not changed ownership 
since the law took effect, was not outfitted with a gas detection meter. But 
city geologist Joseph W. Cobarrubias said last week that there was no guarantee 
that a meter would have caught the problem in the leased one-story building, 
because tests conducted a few feet away from the electrical conduit found only 
trace elements of methane. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a hunch, investigators took off the conduit's plastic switch plate, 
where they found a 25% concentration of methane inside the electrical 
compartment, well above the 5% threshold for a possible explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"In a confined space, and with the right mixture, it was going to blow up, but 
the bank is well-ventilated so there's no chance of an explosion now," said 
Fleet Rust, president of Geoscience Analytical Inc., a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Wells Fargo virtually abandoned the building, at least 
temporarily. Work crews moved safe-deposit boxes, signature cards and other 
essential records to temporary quarters in the former site of the Butterfield's 
auction house on Larchmont Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The move was decided by bank management, but it was reinforced by an order from 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department to evacuate the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"We've moved all our operations out, but that doesn't mean we won't return if 
the building is retrofitted" to meet methane safety standards, said bank 
spokeswoman Shilkret. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the building were not available to comment on the methane 
incident. Indeed, it was difficult to determine who actually owns the brown 
stucco structure. 
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said their lease indicates that the landlords are Jacob Libaw of 
Beverly Hills and Arnold Skovron of Los Angeles, but Libaw said in a brief 
telephone conversation that he sold it to Skovron "a number of years ago." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at Skovron's residence said that Skovron is 
"one of the owners" but said he was "too old to be interviewed." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you talk to his partner, Mr. Libaw?" she recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Kaufman, Skovron's attorney, said that his client "no longer has any 
interest in the property, so I think Mr. Libaw is sort of trying to put you 
off." He declined to say more. 
</P>
<P>
To further confuse the issue, the property is listed in county records as 
belonging to Shawn D. Libaw "et al" and Evan J. Libaw. 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco post office box is listed as the owners' mailing address, but 
voting registration records indicate that a Shawn D. Libaw shares Jacob Libaw's 
Summit Drive residence in Beverly Hills. An Evan J. Libaw, whose medical 
practice is located on Wilshire Boulevard, did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
City geologist Cobarrubias, meanwhile, said he was not surprised by the latest 
methane incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Low-pressure methane gas occurs throughout the area," said Cobarrubias, who 
investigated the March, 1985, explosion and fire at the nearby Ross Dress for 
Less clothing outlet, and a 1989 gas leak at the Gilmore Bank across 3rd Street 
from the Ross store. 
</P>
<P>
The geologist's latest methane report, released in January of this year, called 
for establishment of a surveillance system to identify danger spots, "but it 
just hasn't gotten off the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The system was supposed to be funded through legislation drawn up by state Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), but California Department of Conservation 
officials said earlier this month that the city had missed its chance to 
collect its $129,000 allocation. 
</P>
<P>
The money went to Huntington Beach and Newport Beach instead. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Druyun, an analyst for the Los Angeles City Council, said that the city 
first wanted to use the money to buy a $500,000 mobile laboratory that would 
roam the streets of the Fairfax District to "sniff" for possible methane leaks. 
</P>
<P>
After that was rejected by state officials, the city decided that the problem 
was "far more complicated than otherwise appeared," that there was no way to 
know if any action would prove to be helpful or dangerous, and that it might 
expose the city to costly lawsuits, Druyun said. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of money that the state had available was insufficient to meet the 
problems," he said, adding that the municipal code makes it clear that property 
owners are responsible for the safety of their premises. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti said Thursday that he found the city's failure to act inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
"It was written specifically for them," the senator said. "Anything you do, you 
run a litigation risk, but there's a greater hazard involved, and it's going to 
be an endless hazard unless we totally mitigate the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Litigation can be costly. Although the fire in the clothing store happened 
almost six years ago, attorneys for the 21 injured shoppers and store employees 
only recently settled with the last of the defendants in the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
Court records indicate that, as of October, the victims had won damages 
totaling at least $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest known payment, the May Co. stores, which owned the property at 
the time, and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., which sold it two months 
before the fire, jointly paid out $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the case said that McFarland Energy Inc., which operates 
a nearby oil field, settled for a larger sum, but the amount was sealed by 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the victims and for McFarland did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment on the case, but a letter from McFarland attorney Russell S. 
Wollman said the oil firm was settling, even though it has "consistently 
maintained that it is not liable for the fire/explosion."

NEW COUNCIL MAJORITY TAKES A SOFTER LINE ON GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY PARK: THREE NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THEY ARE JUST HELPING PROPERTY 
OWNERS UNFAIRLY PENALIZED BY THE CITY'S STRICT ZONING RULES. BUT SLOW-GROWTH 
FORCES ARE NERVOUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Signaling a change from their predecessors' slow-growth posture, members of the 
new City Council majority have, in a string of recent decisions, exempted 
homeowners and builders from strict development rules. 
</P>
<P>
The three new council members elected in April -- Marie Purvis, Fred Balderrama 
and Samuel Kiang -- say they are simply helping property owners unfairly hit by 
the slow-growth measures passed by previous city councils. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopefully righting the wrongs of the past," Kiang said. 
</P>
<P>
But the trend is rattling the nerves of slow-growth advocates in Monterey Park, 
who say the new council is rolling back hard-earned progress in curbing 
development in a rapidly growing city. 
</P>
<P>
"My stomach is turning," said Councilwoman Betty Couch, who opposes relaxing 
any building laws. "Even though there was rudeness and arguing with the other 
council, there were high standards." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the City Council has voted to: 
</P>
<P>
Permit a homeowner, Tina Martin, to continue using her garage on South Orange 
Avenue as a second unit, which is prohibited by city zoning codes. 
</P>
<P>
Allow a bank owner, Anthony P. Lee, to build a two-story building on West 
Garvey Avenue in an area where it otherwise would be prohibited under 
voter-approved zoning codes developed by the previous council. 
</P>
<P>
Allow resident Radimiro S. Medina to build a room above his garage on West 
Fernfield Drive that would exceed the maximum height allowed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say such projects probably wouldn't have been approved by the 
previous council, which was dominated by slow-growth activists who made 
sweeping changes in Monterey Park's development laws. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Barry L. Hatch, Patricia Reichenberger and Chris Houseman, the council 
in 1986 and 1987 imposed moratoriums on apartment and condominium construction 
and commercial development while they developed the stricter height, parking 
and lot size requirements that are now city law. They also spearheaded a major 
overhaul of the city's commercial districts to discourage piecemeal 
development. The plan was approved by the voters in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Balderrama, Kiang and Purvis were swept into office, replacing Hatch 
and Reichenberger, who were defeated, and Houseman, who decided not to run. The 
three new members joined Mayor Judy Chu and Councilwoman Couch, who were 
elected in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined exactly how many zoning decisions have been made by 
the council since the new members took office, but City Planning Director M. 
Margo Wheeler said there have been a dozen requests for building code 
exemptions this year. 
</P>
<P>
Couch criticized the new council's more lenient stance on growth issues, 
accusing the three new members of being pro-developer. "They want 
construction," she said. "They want business." 
</P>
<P>
Chu said she was elected on a controlled-growth platform, but added: "There 
were times in the past where the council was overzealous and as a result 
(building) restrictions were very, very difficult for the community." This year 
Chu has voted for some of the exemptions and opposed others. 
</P>
<P>
Balderrama said it was necessary in previous years to put the brakes on runaway 
construction. But he also said the city shouldn't chase away developers with 
sound ideas. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Balderrama cited Standard Savings Bank, which was unable to 
build a two-story building because the area was rezoned for retail uses in 1987 
under a voter-approved redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission refused to exempt the bank from the zoning rules, and 
Lee, the owner, appealed to the City Council. Last Tuesday the council allowed 
the construction after Lee promised to pay the city an unspecified sum of money 
equal to the sales taxes a retail store would have generated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least one new council member has come out in favor of exempting 
a major residential project from any future laws designed to cut down on 
so-called "mansionization." 
</P>
<P>
The council is considering such an ordinance, which was first proposed in 1988 
under the previous council. 
</P>
<P>
Balderrama, however, said the proposed Monterey Views development -- 86 
single-family homes to be built on the city's last chunk of vacant residential 
land -- would suffer financially if the developer had to reduce the size of the 
homes to comply with such a law. So far, the City Council hasn't decided 
whether to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of exempting the project from new size restrictions sparked verbal 
protests from some members of a slow-growth group, the Residents Assn. of 
Monterey Park. The group's president, Irv Gilman, warned that the city would be 
setting a new precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"The floodgates are open," Gilman said such an exemption would signal 
developers. "Come to Monterey Park and build it any way you want."

LA VERNE: BRACKETT FIELD COMES COMPLETE WITH A DREAM LOCALE BY THE CRAGGY SAN 
GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND A FRIENDLY LITTLE RESTAURANT WHERE THE AIRPORT REGULARS 
TAKE MEALS ON A SHADED TERRACE.

<TEXT>
<P>
So you're up there. The little airplane bobs lightly across airy swells, and 
the San Gabriel Valley is spread out 1,000 feet below. Where do you go? 
</P>
<P>
How about Brackett Field in La Verne? There's a little restaurant in the 
administration building. You can sit on an open-air terrace there and watch all 
the Beechcraft and Cessnas touching down daintily on the airport's parallel 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while a whistling Lear jet, as sleek as an M-1 round, will rocket 
into the sky, or some World War II antique will sail in with a guy who looks 
like a young Van Johnson at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
It's an airplane fanatic's dream locale, with a backdrop of the craggiest San 
Gabriel Mountains. People have been known to move, lock, stock and barrel, to 
La Verne or San Dimas just so they could be close to Brackett. 
</P>
<P>
Take Alan and Karen Smith, formerly of Yorba Linda. Alan Smith says their 
recent move to the Via Verde section of San Dimas, a mile away from Brackett, 
placed them in a rare statistical category -- "people who actually moved out of 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The couple are regulars at Norm's Hangar these days, taking their coffee and 
scrambled eggs on the awning-shaded terrace before going up for a spin in their 
Cessna 310, a nifty twin-engine plane with room for six people. 
</P>
<P>
"We really liked the airport and we wanted to be close," says Alan Smith, 
customer services manager for Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
John and Ken Nissen, the brothers who manage the little restaurant, say there 
are a lot of people like the Smiths. Their customers shove the tables together 
on Saturdays and Sundays to plan airborne excursions to Death Valley or the 
High Sierra, or they just sit there, dreamily taking in the panorama or 
listening to the control tower chatter that is broadcast over speakers in the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"You have your pilots and your wanna-be pilots," says Rob Cheek, another 
recreational pilot who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plenty of folks flying in from Las Vegas or Anaheim for 
breakfast or lunch at Norm's. 
</P>
<P>
"On nice days, you'll see them coming in, one after the other," says John 
Nissen, a short man with a neat, marmalade-colored beard. You'll probably see 
them ordering omelets and bacon cheeseburgers at Norm's too, or else waiting at 
the front door for an empty table. 
</P>
<P>
Norm, for whom the restaurant is named, is the brothers' father, a longtime 
restaurateur who has operated coffee shops at county golf courses for more than 
20 years. Right now, he's in Palm Springs, keeping tabs on his restaurant at 
the Palm Springs Municipal Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the customers, father and sons have all been bitten with the 
flying disease. "Yeah, I'll get up a couple of times a week for a half hour, 45 
minutes," says Ken Nissen, stepping from behind the grill. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the conversation at Norm's focuses a lot on fuel prices. The price of 
100 octane low-lead airplane fuel has shot up about 25%, to better than $2 a 
gallon, since the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to just jump in a plane and say, 'Let's go fly,' " says 
Roy Wallace, a flight instructor who is one of the Sunday morning regulars at 
Norm's. "Now you have to make an event of it." 
</P>
<P>
People also fret a lot about privatization. The 286-acre airport is owned by 
Los Angeles County, which is committed to selling off its five airports. 
Airport Manager Doug Nelson acknowledges that the Public Works Department has 
been negotiating with contractors to take over Brackett. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only thing people have to worry about is if a private contractor 
decides to raise the (rental) rates," Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
Brackett is, of course, a choice location for Southern California recreational 
fliers. It's outside that 30-mile radius around LAX, where private planes must 
be equipped with special transponders to broadcast their altitude and location. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to cross the Los Angeles Basin to get in or out," says Smith. 
Natural passes through the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains, carrying 
fliers north, northeast or east, extend out from Brackett like spokes from a 
hub. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled between Bonelli Park and the Fairplex, the airport is largely isolated 
from residential areas -- and neighbors complaining about the noise. 
</P>
<P>
And pilots say it's a gem of an airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the prettiest one in Southern California," says Joyce Johnson, who got 
her pilot's license to keep up with her retired husband. "In the wintertime, 
there's snow in the mountains . . . the whole bit." 
</P>
<P>
But hangar space is in short supply. The airport's 260 hangar spots rent for 
between $265 and $470 a month, says Nelson. And there's a long waiting list. 
Brackett's 250 tie-down spots go for $52 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the ritual at Norm's is grumbling about expenses. "People have this 
idea that we're all rich," says Cheek. "But most of us are poor because we're 
pilots. It's paying $50 for a cup of coffee . . . Think of it. We travel 100 
miles for a cup of coffee and a hamburger."

But for most, the experience of flying is clearly a liberating one, worth every 
penny that it costs. "You're looking at somebody who used to be afraid to get 
into an airplane," says Johnson, whose husband, Bob, learned how to fly after 
he retired. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that, if we were going to be up there, I ought to learn how to land 
the thing in case anything happened," she says. After a few hours of flight 
instruction, she was hooked. "I decided I better take my own ticket," she says, 
laughing. "Now I've lived long enough to be a worry to my kids, instead of the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everybody at Norm's is enamored of the idea of pitching through 
the sky in a flimsy single-engine plane. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Downing, whose husband, Norm, is a flying enthusiast and frustrated 
pilot, says she'll never get into one of those babies again. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend insisted that I go up with him once," she says, watching the planes 
on the Brackett runway the way a rabbit ponders a cobra. "I hyperventilated so 
bad up there. When I got off, my legs felt like water. Never again."

SEWER FEES TO INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual sewer service fees for single-family dwellings and apartments will 
jump from $6 to $37.48 as a result of a 4-1 vote by the City Council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new revenue would be used to establish a fund for maintenance of the city 
sewer system and sewer-line repair and replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Algird G. Leiga was the only council member to oppose the higher rates, which 
are effective April 1. He said an increase of more than 600% could not be 
justified in a time of rising federal and state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But other council members argued that the move would be fiscally responsible in 
the long run because regular upkeep of the sewer system would prevent costly 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Last fiscal year, the city's sewer service fees generated $89,384 in revenue, 
but $118,864 was spent for minimal cleaning and emergency repairs. The 
additional money came from the city's general fund, according to city staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance approved Tuesday increases the average annual fee for industrial 
plants from $154 to about $1,500. Fees for restaurants would range from $100 to 
more than $500, depending on size; currently all restaurants are assessed an 
annual fee of $6.

MANSION EXPANSION DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A physician who has been seeking permission for 2 1/2 years to expand his 
10-room house on Orlando Road was again turned down by the city this week. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Robert Wood, representing Dr. and Mrs. Kamal Batniji, asked the City 
Council on Wednesday to overturn the Planning Commission's latest denial of the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Since Batniji first filed his expansion plans in May, 1988, the matter has come 
before the commission eight times, most recently in September, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wood presented letters from residents in support of the expansion, the 
City Council said it would violate the city code because Batniji's house would 
extend too close to his rear neighbor's lot. 
</P>
<P>
Batniji said he has retained the law firm of Hahn &amp; Hahn to explore legal 
action against the city.

CITY TO SHARE PARK FUNDS

The city will turn over to La Puente $20,000 it hopes to receive under a state 
environmental act to help La Puente upgrade lighting on a softball field, the 
City Council decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Industry expects to receive the money under the California Wildlife, Coastal 
and Park Land Bond Act of 1988, which provides funds for acquisition, 
development, rehabilitation, protection or restoration of park, wildlife, 
coastal and natural lands in California. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to approve a joint-powers agreement between the 
two cities, authorizing the transfer of funds to be used at La Puente Park.

WATER FUND REVIEW REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Water Resources Control Board has declined to look into concerns 
raised by local water agencies upset over changes negotiated privately in a 
$20.5-million escrow account involving a controversial Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Local water officials complained that the changes, quietly granted by the state 
to Browning-Ferris Industries and its Azusa landfill subsidiary, could allow 
the firms to reclaim the money they pledged toward cleanup of San Gabriel 
Valley water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state water board's attorney has notified the Upper San Gabriel 
Valley Municipal Water District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California and the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster that they failed "to 
raise any substantial issues which merit review." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, BFI's $20.5 million would be returned to the company if it 
is able to track down parties believed responsible for the pollution.11/18/90

TEACHER CONTRACT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arcadia Unified School District board last week approved a new teachers' 
contract that includes a 5% pay raise for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year pact also includes a less expensive health plan and up to 40% 
higher stipends for coaches and other special personnel, bringing compensation 
levels close to the county average. 
</P>
<P>
First-year district teachers will now earn $31,832. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the contract has been settled this early in recent 
memory. No outside negotiators were involved on either side," Supt. Terry 
Towner said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also satisfied Caroline Auburn, president of the Arcadia Teachers 
Union. "It was a great challenge for both sides to resolve this in a way that 
was amiable," she said. "Neither side felt like they had given away the shop." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers voted to ratify the contract Nov. 2. Negotiators had settled on a 
tentative agreement Oct. 18.

PLAYHOUSE DISTRICT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More work on the Playhouse District Specific Plan was approved Tuesday by City 
Directors, who awarded two contracts for further study of the eight-block area 
along Colorado Boulevard surrounding the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Directors approved spending $10,500 for an economic analysis by 
Williams-Kuebelbeck &amp; Associates and $27,500 for additional design work by 
Lyndon/Buchanan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Since February, a 13-member city task force has been meeting to devise ways of 
upgrading the playhouse district. The city has spent $257,520 studying the 
area, money that will be paid back from assessment fees on property owners in 
the district. A final proposal is expected in June.

DEPOT DESIGNER PICKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach architectural firm has been hired to draft plans for converting 
the old Santa Fe depot into a combined commuter-rail and bus station. 
</P>
<P>
The $97,000 contract was awarded to Thirtieth Street Architects, which had 
submitted the lower of two bids on the design phase of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's representatives estimated that its work will be completed by May, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Algird G. Leiga said Proposition A money earmarked for the 
project would be better used on immediate improvements to public transportation 
within the city. The commuter trains that would use the renovated depot are not 
expected to run until fall, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Nicholas Presecan said the city must must move quickly "so that we 
won't be standing at the track without the trains going by."

LEAF BLOWER LAW EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businesses and institutions will be exempt from a ban on gasoline-powered leaf 
blowers that was approved two weeks ago, the City Council decided. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nick Presecan and council members Algird G. Leiga and Bill McCready 
opposed outlawing the blowers on commercial and institutional property when the 
ordinance came before the council for a second reading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the pollution produced by blowers is "insignificant," Presecan 
proposed that businesses and institutions be permitted to use the equipment if 
there is no harmful effect on nearby residents and their property. The ban on 
use of the blowers in residential areas will be effective March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The revision was opposed by members Judy Wright and Dianne Ring, who said the 
move would create a "code enforcement nightmare."

FAIRFAX IN 1920S WAS ALIVE AND WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of your story, "Dusting Off Old Fairfax," (Times, Nov. 4) is at odds with 
what I remember. I was there starting in 1920 at age 7, and except for the war 
years have been there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The maps from the time may show Sherman, as the area was then known, to have 
been largely empty, but it was not. It was a town, alive and well. It grew up 
around the old car barns for what came to be the Pacific Electric Railway, in 
an area now occupied by the Pacific Design Center. The railway was the area's 
main employer. Families lived north as far as Sunset Boulevard, south as far as 
Santa Monica Boulevard, and generally a few blocks east and west of what is now 
San Vicente Boulevard. Santa Monica Boulevard was the main street, and the main 
business there was a general store run by Al Horowitz, a kindly man who 
survived into the middle of the century. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all built up, however. Below Santa Monica Boulevard around what is 
now La Cienega was a little stream, flowing southeast. Over around Fairfax and 
north of Santa Monica, the area was well developed with single-family homes. It 
was the choice area for kids to visit on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
It was so quiet back then. One night, my grandfather, who lived on a knoll 
above Sunset Boulevard, was disturbed by some boisterous noise. He went to the 
window and called out to the man down the hill to be quiet. The man's 
understandable excuse was that he was exactly a half-mile away.

MORE HELPFUL ADVICE ON CHOOSING COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Yarber's column on the college selection process (Westside, Nov. 1) made 
some fine suggestions to students seeking the best college choices but worked 
with a time line far shorter than we urge for our students. In our experience, 
the college selection process should begin in grade 11, with the student and 
his or her family assessing the student's study objectives, learning style, 
financial resources and other preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that study and the student's academic record, preliminary research can 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
The choices ought to be defined late in grade 11 or during the following summer 
so that the early part of grade 12 can be devoted to applications and 
interviews, if necessary. Delaying until senior year can create a troubling 
diversion from academic obligations. The applications demand time, energy and 
some imagination; the deadlines create panic if homework has not been done in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that many schools cannot offer college counseling as early as 
grade 10 or 11, students and their families can begin intelligent exploration 
before the last year of high school.

HEALTH CONCERNS IN DUMP DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our solution to dealing with trash in the San Gabriel Valley is by rail hauling 
of trash. We must dump our trash in rural areas instead of urban disposal 
sites. By dumping in heavily populated areas, we are gambling with 
comprehensive suicide. We must agree with the mayor of Azusa's statement, "The 
dump site could always be removed, but our water supply cannot be moved." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the water table under the San Gabriel Valley has been recently found to 
be contaminated with 30% of 150 square miles of water being polluted. The Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn. rendered the medical opinion that the Azusa dump, 
with its 400% expansion directly over the water table, is a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is divided on the issue of opposing its expansion. Mayor 
(Eugene F.) Moses and Councilman (Stephen J.) Alexander have opposed the 
expansion, while Councilmen (John R.) Dangleis, (Anthony) Naranjo and (Harry) 
Stemrich are for the expansion of the dump, supporting Browning Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
This giant waste-disposal firm has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
campaign contributions to elected officials. Special-interest money hurts local 
residents by encouraging decisions that are harmful to the public, and puts 
money into the pockets of the greedy, the rich and the unconcerned. Special 
interests are like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sucking the blood out of our 
citizens and feeding themselves while at the same time they are claiming they 
are acting in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
If the truth be known, the special-interest landfill giants desire to let the 
public be damned, while they reap large profits. Everything that pertains to 
our health, does not concern them. 
</P>
<P>
We should even be more concerned, considering that we are in the middle of a 
water shortage. Mayor Moses and Councilman Alexander have been criticized and 
insulted because of their stand against the expansion of the dump. They have 
always had the support of the people of Azusa, along with many residents of 
surrounding cities in the San Gabriel Valley. Keep up the fight to protect our 
water supply, and a well-deserved pat on the back for your good work so far.

As 310 fuzzy teddy bears looked on, Jane Wolff read yet another thank-you note 
to her seventh-grade social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
"Your project has brought me a bit of sunshine into my home," she read to 28 
beaming pupils from Temple Intermediate School. Chalk up another success for 
"Operation Teddy," in which students for more than three years have raised 
money to buy teddy bears for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Students participating in the project, honored last week by the Rosemead City 
Council, hope to present 400 bears to AIDS support organizations at a school 
assembly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff first brought the AIDS issue into her classroom in 1987, when she told 
students about a friend who died of complications from acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. "I saw him die over a period of a year and a half, and 
it's awful," Wolff said. "There's nothing you can do. And I knew we had to 
educate these kids some way." 
</P>
<P>
Students who saw a People magazine picture of a person with AIDS holding a 
teddy bear came up with the idea that led to "Operation Teddy," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Students have raised money by selling candy apples and T-shirts, and by 
persuading family members and friends to "adopt" bears for $15 each. Furry 
companions bearing names like Vanilla Ice, Honey Bear and George Bush come 
complete with adoption certificates signed by "judges" like Ted E. Bare and 
"notary publics" like B.Z. Ber and Scarlett O'Beara. 
</P>
<P>
To add some emotional impact to the gift-giving project, students keep the 
bears for about one month before handing them to AIDS organizations. 
</P>
<P>
One recipient, All Saints AIDS Service Center, will try to distribute the bears 
to patients before Christmas. "It's an emotional experience," said Connie 
McCleary, a director at All Saints AIDS Service, a nonprofit agency in Pasadena 
that is participating in the project for the second year. "One man, who was in 
the hospital and in a lot of pain, said that when he held the teddy bear he 
felt like there was less pain." 
</P>
<P>
Another recipient is the Foothill AIDS Project in Pomona. "Because the kids 
work so hard to do this, when you look at the bear you think of the child," 
said Allan Ferrill, the project's education director, who received his own 
bear, Natasha, last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's an inanimate object, there's a bonding created because you 
think of the child involved." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Operation Teddy" -- which has been expanded to other elementary 
and intermediate schools in the Garvey School District -- intermediate school 
students in gym and science classes receive some information about AIDS, with 
an emphasis on prevention through sexual abstinence, said Maureen Bateman, 
district supervisor for library/media services. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gonzalez, 13, who said he wants to become a doctor because he likes 
helping people, said he doesn't mind the long hours he puts into "Operation 
Teddy" because it's taught him a lot about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that, before attending Wolff's class, interaction with people 
with AIDS scared him. "Now I'll go up and shake a man's hand or give a guy a 
hug if it's someone I know who has AIDS. It doesn't bother me anymore," 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Huong Duong, 13, said the program gives her a sense of satisfaction. "We're 
helping people with AIDS by giving them things like the bears so they can hold 
them when they're down, having bad times, or (have) no one to talk to," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Students this year started raising funds Oct. 1. "Attendance improves during 
'Operation Teddy,' " school Principal Christopher H. Hunt said. "We've even got 
our gang kids involved in this thing. And our suspensions are down. We've only 
suspended one kid all month." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's brother received a bear three years ago and died last year. "He was 
pretty hopeless," Hunt said. "When he got the bear and found out it came from 
the kids, he didn't feel so isolated."

PEOPLE: THEY'LL FORGET THEIR CARES AT THE CIRCUS, IF ONLY FOR A NIGHT

<P>
Most people think of Thanksgiving as being a time of celebration and family 
togetherness. However, for the hundreds of homeless and abused individuals in 
the area, it is a lonely and difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the thoughtfulness of one Westside man, however, nearly 300 less 
fortunate people will attend a Thanksgiving performance of the Cirque de Soleil 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
After purchasing tickets last year for the Cirque de Soleil, Topanga resident 
Warren Chase noticed many homeless people camped out along the beach and 
Palisades Park. On the night of the performance, he said, "I had a very funny 
feeling about going, and I decided to give my tickets away to a homeless 
couple. On my way home, I thought the circus is really a family thing and a lot 
of people just can't afford to buy the tickets." 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed, the county firefighter contacted the manager of the 
Cirque de Soleil in the hope of obtaining additional tickets for other homeless 
people. "I was overwhelmed when they were so supportive and generous with the 
tickets, " he noted. "And, again this year, they've been kind enough to donate 
the tickets." The tickets are distributed through the Los Angeles County 
Services for Children and Sojourn, a shelter for battered women in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"The tickets won't cure all their problems," Chase said, "but I hope the circus 
gives them time to enjoy an outing like other families and a little 
inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica resident Spring de Haviland is producing a special videotape, 
"Support and Salute the Troops," to be sent to the Armed Forces men and women 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
She said the tape will include personalized messages and greetings from former 
President Ronald Reagan, singer Lee Greenwood, and comedians Bob Hope and Fred 
Travelina, as well as radio disc jockey Charlie Tuna and his morning team. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something positive for the troops and although it's a lean time 
for me, the troops are making more sacrifices than I am," De Haviland said. 
</P>
<P>
The tape is scheduled to be sent to the troops at Thanksgiving, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Westside resident Alicia Magal has been named director of the Council on Jewish 
Life's Commission on Jewish Arts and Culture. 
</P>
<P>
The Council on Jewish Life is a department of the Jewish Federation Council of 
Greater Los Angeles and is responsible for enhancing Jewish life in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Magal has worked as an educator, museum exhibit coordinator and consultant on 
special event planning. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Anne Cairns, a teacher at Malibu Park School, was one of four 
finalists for 1991 California Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Cairns will be honored before the State Board of Education in January. She will 
also receive a $4,000 award. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Seidler Jr., chairman of Loyola Marymount University's Board of 
Trustees, was recently elected to the board of directors of the Assn. of 
Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Seidler joins 22 other board members from across the country and will serve a 
three-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Mariko Laniado has been appointed executive director of The Wellness Community 
for the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Laniado, a former cancer patient, began as an intern at the facility three 
years ago and was program director prior to her promotion.

MERGER OF CATHOLIC GIRLS, BOYS SCHOOLS TO CUT COSTS

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1960, when David Escarcega was a sophomore at Cantwell High School, the 
girls of Sacred Heart of Mary High School, just across Hay Avenue, were 
tantalizingly near. 
</P>
<P>
Under the watchful eyes of the Sacred Heart of Mary sisters, the Catholic boys 
of Cantwell High came no closer to the girls during school hours than a 
lingering glance through the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The sisters were very restrictive," recalled Escarcega, whose wife, Christine, 
attended Sacred Heart of Mary while he was at Cantwell. "Though we used to look 
at the girls from afar, the best we could do was cruise by." 
</P>
<P>
Escarcega's memory of how it was between young men and women in Catholic 
schools in the Montebello area is all that is left of a 40-year tradition that 
will come to an end next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has announced that dwindling 
enrollment and the soaring cost of a private education have forced it to merge 
Cantwell High School with Sacred Heart of Mary High School. 
</P>
<P>
The coeducational school will be called Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar move in the San Gabriel Valley, the all-boys La Salle High School 
in Pasadena will admit girls for the first time next September. The La Salle 
move does not, however, involve a merger. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle is a Catholic School run by the Christian Brothers, and officials have 
cited a desire to offer an alternative to mostly single-sex Catholic high 
schools, as well as broadening their enrollment base, as reasons for going 
co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
Sacred Heart of Mary, which has been owned by the order of the Religious of the 
Sacred Heart of Mary since 1942, will be closed, said Sister Joan Treacy, the 
provincial superior of the order. 
</P>
<P>
Treacy said that the order's decision to keep tuition costs low to allow more 
students to attend the school has created such a financial burden that the 
order can no longer afford to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
For many, especially the alumni of both schools, the consolidation means the 
end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
But students, parents and alumni said that there is little option, given the 
bleak enrollment figures and studies that reveal a shrinking pool of students 
will enter Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see it go," said Escarcega, whose son, Marc, is now a senior at 
Cantwell. "At one time I thought that, if I wanted my son to have a co-ed 
education I would have sent him to a public school or to Amat (Bishop Amat, a 
co-ed school), but I'm more open minded now. . . . I look at it as one chapter 
closing and another opening." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Cantwell would become a coeducational school had been 
rumored for years, but it became a matter of serious discussion about three 
years ago when the archdiocese commissioned a study of the problem of dwindling 
enrollment in its schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell has a capacity for 600 students, but is now only serving 250 students, 
a 50% drop in the number of students enrolled five years ago. Most of the 
students come from the East Los Angeles, Montebello and San Gabriel Valley 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rivera, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the study by the archdiocese 
recommended several options to buoy enrollment, including an aggressive 
recruiting campaign and the consolidation with Sacred Heart of Mary. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the leadership of the Sacred Heart of Mary announced that it could 
not afford to continue operating the high school. The archdiocese then made its 
decision to consolidate, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Laura Siebert, the principal of Sacred Heart of Mary, said that as long 
as five years ago the order realized it could not continue operating the school 
as it had, and shortly thereafter began talks with the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, students have been told that the school might become 
co-ed, and students who wanted to attend an all-girls' school were encouraged 
to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't made any secret about it," Siebert said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Sacred Heart of Mary teachers are expected to continue working at 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Several committees have been formed to oversee such details as the writing of 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary's new school philosophy statement and its 
modification of curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Siebert said that her students, for the most part, are looking forward to the 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a lot of change . . . but out of the combination we will come 
up with things that will make both schools better," she said. "We could have 
programs that neither school could afford on its own, such as fine arts or 
drama." 
</P>
<P>
Some Cantwell students initially resisted the idea of sharing their classrooms 
with girls. Many said they didn't want the school's name, its colors and mascot 
to change, or endure having its creed of "Act Manfully" neutered. Others said 
they feared that camaraderie among the boys would disappear as soon they began 
competing for the attentions of their new classmates. 
</P>
<P>
The name change is still a sore spot with Cantwell alumni and some students, 
but most are looking at the consolidation of the schools as a practical matter, 
a necessity that must be faced to keep a good Catholic school in Montebello. 
And, students said, a coeducational classroom could be a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not mad about it," said sophomore Gabriel Arenas. "A lot of guys are 
happy that girls are going to be at the school."

THE BENEFITS OF A SMALL DOWN PAYMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HOME BUYING: TAX LAWS ENCOURAGE KEEPING CASH DOWN PAYMENTS AS SMALL AS 
POSSIBLE. PROFITS ARE GREATER WHEN BORROWING IN A RISING MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a syndicated real estate columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You are ready to buy a home. Whether it is your first home or a move-up home, 
you are probably debating whether to make a large or small cash down payment. 
Of course, if you don't have much cash available, you have little choice but to 
make a minimal 5% or 10% down payment (or no down payment if you qualify for a 
VA home loan). 
</P>
<P>
However, even if you have lots of cash available, you may be better off making 
the smallest possible down payment and obtaining the largest available 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Tax Act encourages home buyers to obtain the largest available 
mortgage and make the smallest possible cash down payment. That's because the 
government allows you to deduct all your interest up to $1 million used to buy 
or build a house. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, homeowners can deduct interest on a home-equity loan up to 
$100,000. This means homeowners who make a large down payment and later decide 
to refinance can only deduct interest on the amount of their original mortgage 
plus interest on a home-equity loan up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Existing home mortgages as of Oct. 17, 1987, are "grandfathered" under the 1987 
Tax Act. For example, if your first mortgage balance on that date was $75,000 
and you had a $35,000 second mortgage, you can deduct interest on those loans 
plus interest on new home-equity financing up to $100,000 additional for a 
total of $210,000. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the tax deductions for home mortgage interest, there are other 
advantages to making a small down payment. The principal one is called 
leverage, meaning you control all the property benefits with a small amount of 
cash and a large percentage of borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you buy a $100,000 home with a $10,000 cash down payment 
and a $90,000 mortgage. If the home appreciates 5% in market value during the 
next 12 months, that $5,000 profit is a 50% return on your $10,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you had bought the same $100,000 house with $100,000 cash 
and it appreciates 5% in value during the next year, your $5,000 profit is only 
a 5% return on your $100,000 investment. That is obviously a very poor return. 
</P>
<P>
If home values in your town should go down, your equity would obviously be 
diminished. But if you had only invested $10,000, the most you could lose is 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if you paid all-cash for the house, you could theoretically lose 
all the $100,000 that you invested. In other words, owning a home free and 
clear can be very risky. 
</P>
<P>
Your overall return is higher, on a percentage basis, if you make a minimal 
down payment. If property values go down, you'll lose more if you made a big 
down payment than if you had made a small one. 
</P>
<P>
Special note should be made that whenever possible, home buyers should avoid 
personal liability on their mortgages, just in case the property declines in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
There can be severe income tax consequences to walking away from a mortgage, 
but the situation is worsened if the property is lost by foreclosure and the 
lender can collect a deficiency loss judgment against the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Current tax law encourages homeowners to borrow heavily on their home purchases 
so they can maximize their income tax deductions. But high leverage also can be 
wise investing because a small equity maximizes the potential profit percentage 
while minimizing the cash you can lose if home values decline. 
</P>
<P>
Another way of stating these leverage principles is if you think home values 
will go up, high leverage with a small down payment will be most profitable. 
But if you think home values will go down, don't buy.

CONDO QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: OWNER REFUSES TO PAY BECAUSE REPAIRS NOT MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I serve on the board of directors of a new condominium development 
that has just recently been turned over to the homeowners by the developer. One 
of our owners is seriously delinquent in paying his monthly assessments. 
</P>
<P>
The delinquent owner refuses to pay because the developer has not completed 
some repair work inside his condominium unit. 
</P>
<P>
What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First, your board must enforce the established delinquency procedures 
that should have been adopted as soon as the association was formed. Always 
enforce these procedures fairly and consistently with all owners who are 
delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a friendly visit between the delinquent owner and the board president 
or treasurer will clear up the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It should by easy to reason with the owner, especially now that the association 
is no longer under the developer's control. You can explain to him that the 
assessment fee pays for common area expenses or common utilities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the domestic water is probably a common exposure. Ask him if he 
thinks that his neighbors should have to continue to pay his share of the water 
bill. Another example would by the lighting in the common corridors. These are 
services that he is using every day and not paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
The owner has an obligation to pay the assessment regardless of the condition 
of his own unit. His "beef" is with the developer, and the association has no 
control over when the developer will complete the repair work. In my opinion, 
the board should not assume any responsibility to assist the owner in getting 
the work done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Board Didn't Stop Noisy Owner 
</P>
<P>
Q: One of the owners in our condominium has been harassing the downstairs owner 
by stomping, slamming doors and creating other nuisances. The harassed owner 
notified the previous board of directors, and the only action taken by the 
board was verbal warning to the noisy owner. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the legal documents prohibit "offensive activity that may be an 
annoyance or nuisance," the board felt that the problem should be solved 
neighbor to neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Now the complaining owner is serving as president of the board and has directed 
the management company to send the noisy owner a letter reminding him of the 
nightly "quiet hours" in our rules. The noisy neighbor now quiets down at 10 
p.m. but still is creating disturbances at other times. 
</P>
<P>
The new board president is threatening to sue the prior board members for not 
taking action on this matter. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think the prior board members were negligent in not resolving this 
problem? What can this board do to resolve it now? 
</P>
<P>
A: This is the kind of problem that no board member wants to have to solve. The 
board members may not have been negligent but, in my opinion, they should have 
tried harder to settle this issue. They could have sent a written violation 
notice to the noisy owner. Then they could have scheduled a hearing if the 
noise continued. 
</P>
<P>
If the association's legal documents permit a fine for this kind of infraction, 
then they could have levied a fine. 
</P>
<P>
If the current board tries all these methods and fails to get a positive 
response, then perhaps only a court order will get the offending owner's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
The complaining owner could file a legal action against the noisy owner. If the 
board does not enforce the association's legal documents, any individual owner 
has the right to enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
The association board should consult an attorney who specializes in condominium 
law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Protect the Board From Lawsuits 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our homeowner association has had numerous conflicts and lawsuits in the 
past. Now it is almost impossible to get anyone to serve on the board because 
they are afraid of being sued. 
</P>
<P>
I was recently appointed to the board, but I really don't know what my 
responsibilities are. What can board members do to limit our liability? What 
resources can you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, you should make sure that the association has directors' and 
officers' liability insurance, adequate property insurance, fidelity bond 
coverage and worker's compensation coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that you comply with all the insurance requirements in your 
declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs). The 
directors' and officers' liability insurance will not protect you if you fail 
to adequately insure the association. 
</P>
<P>
Second, read all the legal documents of the association and board meeting 
minutes, contracts, financial statements and management reports for the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Third, educate yourself by attending seminars given by Community Associations 
Institute. Check your local phone directory or call directory assistance for 
the chapter near you. 
</P>
<P>
CAI has many publications that would be helpful. A basic resource is a booklet 
titled "Community Association Leadership: A Guide For Volunteers." Topics 
covered include the role of officers, effective meetings, committee operations 
and fiduciary responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet is available from the Greater Los Angeles chapter for $3.50 for 
each booklet ordered. Send your check to: CAI, P.O. Box 84303, Los Angeles, 
Calif. 90073. Allow six weeks for delivery. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Board Uses Reserve Fund for Operations 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: The previous board of directors in my homeowner association was 
frugal and maintained a reserve fund for future repair of streets, tennis 
courts and gates. 
</P>
<P>
Our present board has apparently spent all of our operating funds for the year 
and now must dip into the reserves. Our assessment fees for the next year will 
probably be increased. 
</P>
<P>
I thought the purpose of the reserve study was to determine the amount of money 
needed for the future and that none of the money should be used until the full 
amount has been accumulated. What does state law say about spending reserve 
funds? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: California law does not dictate how the funds are to be spent. The law 
states that a reserve study must be done to determine the amount of funds that 
will be needed for future repair and replacement of association property. 
</P>
<P>
The association does not have to wait until the tennis court reserve is fully 
funded before using the money to resurface the court, for instance. Each year, 
as money from the reserves is used, the reserve budget for the following year 
must be revised to allocate more money as needed. 
</P>
<P>
If the board is using reserve funds to make up the shortfall in the operating 
funds for this year, the budget for next fiscal year should be revised to cover 
the replacement of any reserve funds that are used to this year. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if the association is now using reserve funds to pay the 
gardener for landscape maintenance, the operating budgets for next year will 
have to be increased to reflect the true cost of the landscape maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Then the reserve budget will have to be increased to replace the funds that 
were used for the operating expenses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve funds can be used for emergencies at the discretion of the board, but 
in this case, it might have been more prudent to have a special assessment 
rather than use the reserve funds. Using the reserve fund for ongoing operating 
expenses is a poor way of managing the association's money.

Earle and Margaret Deeble not only fell in love with the Hawaiian Islands 
during their annual trips, they also fell in love with the island's tropical 
plants -- particularly the plumeria. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is almost impossible to visit Hawaii and not be impressed with the 
beauty and the incredibly exotic fragrance of plumeria blooms. A lei of 
plumeria flowers is often the first item greeting island visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Deebles, who live in Fullerton, wondered if they could experience the 
marvelous aroma and beauty of the plumeria in their own yard. They made 
inquiries on the source of plumeria plants and discovered that a friend had 
them growing in a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The friend was glad to give the Deebles a cutting, but he also doubted that the 
Deebles would have much luck growing plumeria plants in the outdoor environment 
of their yard. 
</P>
<P>
That was 15 years ago. The Deebles now have these beautiful, fragrant plants 
growing in front, back and side yards. They have eight different varieties with 
lovely blooms in shades of white, pink, red, white with yellow centers, orange 
(very rare) and bicolors. 
</P>
<P>
The plants have thick branches with tropical-looking dark-green leaves, which 
are large and pointed. The leaves range in size from 10 to 14 inches. Most of 
their varieties are deciduous and drop their leaves in mid-winter; foliage 
growth resumes in early spring and blooms occur from late spring until cold 
weather sets in. 
</P>
<P>
According to Earle Deeble, even though it is considered exotic, plumeria is 
easy to grow in much of Southern California if it is sheltered from frosts and 
planted in a soil that drains well. 
</P>
<P>
The plants will absolutely not tolerate a wet, soggy soil. The soil must be 
loose and drain quickly. The only plumeria plant the Deebles have ever lost was 
planted in a lower area of their yard where the drainage was poor. 
</P>
<P>
Plumeria can be grown as a shrub or a small tree. In either case, the plants 
make a stunning addition to a landscape. They will thrive in full sun in the 
milder coastal areas; however, in the hotter inland valleys the plants should 
receive half-day sun. Earle Deeble recommends that, in the hotter areas, the 
plants receive morning sun, but be protected from the hotter afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
In colder areas of the Southland, the plants need protection from temperatures 
that drop below 28 degrees Fahrenheit. The Deebles live on a Fullerton hillside 
where freezing temperatures seldom occur. The few times their plants sustained 
frost damage, they simply removed the damaged portions, and the plants 
continued to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a frost-protected planting site, some protections will be 
realized by tenting the plants with plastic covers on nights that frost is 
expected. Ground cloths used for painting are fine, but the plastic requires 
some type of frame so it doesn't come into contact wit the foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Always remove the covering promptly after danger of frost has passed. A flood 
light at the base of the plant will also give some protection from frost. 
</P>
<P>
Although plumeria plants are becoming more available in local nurseries, the 
Deebles have grown most of their plants from cuttings. According to Bill 
Nelson, a tropical plant expert at Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista, the 
plants are easy to propagate from cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a friend who has a plumeria plant simply select a branch during the 
plant's dormant period, make a cutting (any size branch), lay the branch in a 
shady area for four days to one week to harden it off. 
</P>
<P>
Then plant the cutting vertically in a container of moist growing mix. The 
cutting should be immersed in the container soil to about one-half of its 
length. In about three weeks to a month, the cuttings will root and be ready 
for transplanting. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't obtain cuttings, the plants are sold in 1-, 5- or 15-gallon 
containers in various Southland nurseries. Nelson feels that the best buy is 
the 5-gallon size as it will produce blooms quickly and is more reasonably 
priced. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a yard, plumeria plants will do well in a large container. 
The Deebles have beautiful specimens in containers. 
</P>
<P>
I have a 7-year-old plumeria on my patio that has thrived in a half whiskey 
barrel container. It produces hundreds of fragrant blooms which lend a tropical 
scent to my patio area and the blooms keep well in water for up to 10 days in 
an aromatic indoor bouquet. The container my plant resides in is set on casters 
and I roll it into the garage when I expect the temperature to drop below 28 
degrees Fahrenheit on a given winter night. 
</P>
<P>
As to proper care, the Deebles water the plumeria in their yard once a week. 
They water the plants in containers whenever the soil starts to dry out. They 
feed their plants with a 15-30-15 liquid fertilizer applied to the base of the 
plants at the start of the bloom period in the spring, and repeat the feeding 
several more time during the bloom period. I feed my plumeria with time-release 
fertilizer tablets in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
If allowed to grow in the yard unchecked, most plumeria varieties will reach a 
height of 10 to 15 feet. Plant size may be easily controlled by pruning during 
the dormant season; use cuttings to propagate new plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Deebles have not only beautified their own yard with plumeria plants, they 
have given cuttings to friends, and friends of friends. Many plumeria plants 
from original Deeble cuttings now thrive in Fullerton yards. And although you 
won't confuse Fullerton with Honolulu, the flora is definitely becoming more 
tropical.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: SPRINKLERS ON ROOF OFFER HOME PROTECTION; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: FOR GREATER SAFETY IN BRUSH FIRES, A SPRINKLER SYSTEM CAN BE FASHIONED 
FROM PLASTIC PIPE AND A GARDEN HOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I grabbed my garden hose and climbed up on the roof. Pretty soon I was 
completely surrounded by fire. My T-shirt caught fire and I turned the hose on 
myself to put it out." 
</P>
<P>
These are the words of 60-year-old Gerry Hon, a retired truck driver describing 
his successful effort to save his house during the huge Santa Barbara fire last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could save it," he said, "they wanted me to leave but I refused to 
go because there is a lifetime of mementos in there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hon was lucky. Despite his flammable wood roof, he was able to keep his home 
from burning during the Santa Barbara inferno. 
</P>
<P>
Fire statistics indicate that during almost all the major brush fires of the 
last 30 years, some people have done exactly as Hon did and saved their 
wood-roofed homes using nothing more than a garden hose, while neighboring 
houses went up in flames. 
</P>
<P>
While the preferred roof material on houses in brush fire areas is one that is 
non-combustible, not everyone can afford to spend thousands to replace their 
wood roof. 
</P>
<P>
For those people, installing rooftop sprinklers is a far less dangerous and 
more effective alternative to fighting a fire with a garden hose, or simply 
doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Although local fire officials are reluctant to recommend sprinklers because 
they do not work in all wind conditions and there is not always an adequate 
water supply, many of them do concede off the record that sprinklers have 
helped save lots of homes during fires. 
</P>
<P>
Installing the sprinklers is a do-it-yourself job that is actually a lot easier 
than most people would imagine. 
</P>
<P>
With a little planning, the typical house can be sprinklered in an afternoon or 
less using relatively inexpensive half-inch PUC plastic pipe with impulse 
sprinklers ("Rain Bird," "Lawn Genie," "Toro," "Champion," etc.). And the whole 
job can be completed without having to turn off the water main. 
</P>
<P>
Before starting, check with your local Building and Safety Department about 
permit requirements. In some cities, a permit is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this job requires some common-sense safety rules about using a 
ladder and working on a roof: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Look at the slope of the roof. If it looks too steep to safely walk on, it 
probably is, and you should not attempt this project. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Check the ladder. All the rungs should be securely attached to the side 
rails, the rails should be free of cracks and the "feet" should be in good 
condition to avoid slippage. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- If using an extension ladder, place it on a firm, flat spot where it is to 
be used before raising the extension. The bottom of the ladder should be set 
one-quarter of the ladder's length from the base of the house. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- The ladder should extend at least two feet above the edge of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Before climbing the ladder, check your shoes. You need non-slip, 
preferably rubber sole shoes. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Keep your hips between the rails when reaching out from the ladder. Keep 
one hand on the ladder at all times, and the other free for work. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- When on the roof, walk carefully to avoid damaging shingles and to reduce 
the risk of slipping. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- To re-mount the ladder, grab the upper portion of either rail and place 
your foot in the center of the rung just below the roof edge. Facing the roof, 
grab the other rail and swing your body onto the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Stay off the roof in windy or inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
With those precautions in mind, it's time to get started. Begin by finding a 
hose bib with normal water pressure on the side or rear of the house to supply 
the roof water. 
</P>
<P>
Make a trip up the ladder to measure the length of the ridge, or high point, of 
the roof. If you have a flat roof, measure its long axis. 
</P>
<P>
Also measure the distance from the hose bib to the roof edge and from the roof 
edge to the ridge. This total distance tells you roughly how much one-half-inch 
PUC pipe (schedule 40) to purchase. Add 10% to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe will be placed just below the ridge toward the back of the house so 
they are not seen from the front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the pipe, you need to buy elbows, couplings and T-fittings. 
</P>
<P>
Elbows are fittings that allow you to join pipes at 90 or 45 degrees. Couplings 
allow you to join straight pieces of pipe, and T-fittings are placed in the 
system wherever the sprinklers will be located. 
</P>
<P>
To determine how many impulse sprinklers you need, bear in mind that each one 
will spray a circle roughly 40 feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Calculate the number needed by imagining a series of 40 foot diameter circles 
across the roof, overlapping each other about 15 feet. What is the minimum 
number of circles needed to cover the whole roof? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to this gives you the number and approximate placement of each 
sprinkler. The average home needs three or four. A diagram is often helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Next come the fittings. When you know the number and position of each 
sprinkler, imagine straight lines (which represent the pipe) between all of 
them and over the edge of the roof down to the hose bib. 
</P>
<P>
The number of elbows needed is found by counting how many 45 and 90 degree 
angles are needed to connect the lines. 
</P>
<P>
The number of couplings necessary is found by calculating how many straight 
pipe runs over 10 feet in length are needed. Pipes are sold in 10 foot lengths 
and must be joined by couplings. 
</P>
<P>
Buy several extra elbows and couplings in case your count is off a little. 
</P>
<P>
The quantity of T-fittings needed is determined by the number of sprinklers in 
the system. All sprinklers except the last one in the line are threaded into a 
T-fitting with a one-half-inch internally threaded center outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Several more items are needed from the building supply store: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- A small can of PUC primer and PUC cement. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Enough half-inch pipe straps to secure the pipe at eight-foot intervals. 
Also, a box of one-inch galvanized nails to secure the straps. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- A tube of silicone sealant to cover the nails. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- A metal "Y" valve for a hose bib. This device threads onto a hose bib to 
provide two threaded outlets. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- An adapter to connect male hose thread to half-inch internal pipe threads. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- A PUC coupling and elbow with half-inch internal pipe threads on one side. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- A back-flow preventer for a hose bib. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- A hacksaw. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the fun part . . . assembling the system. Place all the pipes and 
supplies on the roof, and at the end point of the system you will cement the 
elbow with internal threads on one side to a section of PUC pipe. 
</P>
<P>
First coat the end of the pipe and the inside of the elbow (the non-threaded 
side) with the PUC primer. It will dry within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Next coat the same surface with PUC cement and quickly attach the elbow to the 
pipe, making sure that the pipe end seats down fully into the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Position the pipe about a foot below the ridge, with the threaded outlet of the 
elbow pointed straight up. Lay the pipe out so it is aimed toward the next 
sprinkler and secure it with a pipe strap near the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Attach a coupling to the end of the pipe section, using the same method you 
followed to attach the elbow, and connect a second pipe section to it. Secure 
this second pipe section with another strap roughly eight feet from the first 
strap. 
</P>
<P>
Continue adding sections until you reach the predetermined location of the 
second sprinkler. Cut the pipe with the hacksaw if necessary so it ends at the 
sprinkler location. Attach and cement a T-fitting and secure it with a strap so 
that the threaded outlet points straight up. 
</P>
<P>
Continue adding pipe sections, couplings, T-fittings, straps and elbows where 
needed to make turns until you have brought the pipe over the edge of the roof 
and down the wall to a point just past the hose bib. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, you can run the pipe through a one-inch hole drilled in the 
roof above the eave directly above the hose bib. Seal around the pipe with a 
generous amount of silicone sealant. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the actual water supply connection. First attach the "Y" valve to the 
hose bib (make sure the washer is lodged inside it) and tighten it securely by 
hand so that one of the two outlets is either parallel or perpendicular to the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
On that outlet, attach the back-flow preventer and the "hose thread to pipe 
thread" adapter, making sure washers are in place. Tighten them securely by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Now thread the PUC coupling with the threads on one side onto the half-inch 
male threads projecting from the adapter. Tighten with pliers. 
</P>
<P>
Measure and cut small sections of pipe sufficient to connect the pipe from the 
roof with the hose bib fittings and "dry fit" them with couplings and elbows as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have this final connection properly arranged, cement all the pieces 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the roof, screw all the sprinklers into the threaded ends of the 
T-fittings and the last elbow, and remove the adjustment rings from the neck of 
the sprinklers so they spray a full circle (see sprinkler's instructions). 
</P>
<P>
Also, cover all the nail heads with a thick layer of silicone sealant to 
prevent roof leakage. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the water show. Turn the "Y" valve control to "on" and gradually open 
the hose bib valve. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinklers will begin to shoot pulses of water in circular patterns across 
the roof. Adjust each sprinkler according to the instructions to obtain the 
coarsest spray possible. This reduces the chance of a fine stream of water 
being blown by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Now adjust the hose bib valve to the point where you have the best roof 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
That's it. Stand back and watch the waterworks you have created! 
</P>
<P>
To use the regular garden hose, simply turn the "Y" valve control to the 
sprinklers to "off" and turn the other one "on." Attach the hose to the other 
male nipple and use the hose bib valve as you normally would to control the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The final step is to inform each family member on how to use the sprinklers in 
an emergency. I often suggest posting instructions on the wall near the hose 
bib. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to inspect and test the system at least three times annually. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a swimming pool, you may want to consider connecting the roof 
system to a gasoline powered pump that draws water from the pool. Historically, 
there have been some water pressure problems during brush fires and a pool pump 
would assure an adequate water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The pumps are often available through fire protection, building supply or pool 
supply companies, or through catalogue sales of major department stores. 
</P>
<P>
They can be set up with a "quick connect" fitting to allow instant connection 
to the sprinkler system. Consult your plumber.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: BUY SURGE SUPPRESSORS TO PROTECT APPLIANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: A high-voltage surge damaged my TV and microwave oven. I plan to get 
surge suppressors to protect them. How do I select among the many surge 
suppressors available, and do they use much electricity? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Electric surge suppressors are a must for today's homes. Almost every 
electric device, including your radios, TVs, furnace, air conditioner, clothes 
washer and dryer, cordless telephones, etc., has electronic circuitry that can 
be damaged by common super-high-voltage surges. 
</P>
<P>
These high-voltage surges in your house wiring can reach 6,000 volts and occur 
thousands of times each year. Although the surges occur for only a few 
millionths of a second, they can instantly burn out or slowly destroy any 
electronic circuit. Even if the television or microwave is turned off, a strong 
surge can jump the switch and still harm the electronics. 
</P>
<P>
High-voltage surges are generated both from outside and inside your home. 
External surges come from lightning, accidents involving electrical poles and 
nearby businesses. Inside your home, they occur when a clothes washer, air 
conditioner, refrigerator, any device with a motor, turns off. 
</P>
<P>
You should mount a whole-house surge suppressor on the circuit breaker box. 
This blocks external surges from getting into your home. Plug small surge 
suppressors into outlets where you plug in electronic equipment. These protect 
it from internal surges. You can also get surge suppressors to protect your 
telephone line and TV cable from high voltage. 
</P>
<P>
The level of protection varies significantly among similar-looking surge 
suppressors. Different types of electronics require different levels of 
protection. Good suppressors should respond within 1 billionth of a second to 
block surges. The shortest response time specification is best. 
</P>
<P>
Another important specification is the clamping voltage. This indicates at what 
voltage level the surge suppressor begins to block the surge and dissipate it 
harmlessly. It can range from about 330 volts upward and should meet 
Underwriter's Laboratories standards. A lower clamping voltage offers better 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The total surge energy capability indicates how powerful a surge the suppressor 
can dissipate. A higher number is better. A whole-house suppressor is highest, 
up to 400 joules, to block the very powerful external surges. A surge 
suppressor uses very little electricity itself. 
</P>
<P>
When you purchase surge suppressors, compare the specifications. Some also 
offer a guarantee covering your electronic equipment repair costs if it is 
damaged by a surge. You can get whole-house kits containing suppressors for the 
breaker box, wall outlets, telephone and TV antenna or cable. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 356 listing manufacturers of 
surge suppressors, types of suppressors they offer, specifications, guarantees 
and information on the whole-house suppressor kits. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed stamped business-size envelope. Send your requests to James 
Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

ON THE ROAD THROUGH CALIFORNIA'S STARK AND CAVE-RIDDLED LAVA LANDS

LAVA BEDS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cycling along the paved road, I felt as free as an eagle in flight. Suddenly a 
herd of deer greeted me, then bounded off across the sagebrush plains, their 
short tails erect, slender legs like pogo sticks. Sometimes I try to race the 
graceful creatures, but they remained well ahead of me. 
</P>
<P>
I had moved to Lava Beds National Monument to spend the winter and part of the 
spring. My husband (a photographer) and I (a writer-photographer), with our 
Samoyed, Sam, had decided to explore this remote corner of northeast California 
during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
We lived in our travel-trailer at a site provided by the National Park Service, 
since we had volunteered to help count eagles as part of the monument's Bald 
Eagle Project. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in what felt like 10 layers of clothing, I cycled around the park, 
navy-blue polypro head mask on under my helmet, black neoprene shoe covers on 
my feet. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to ride when the temperature was above 35 degrees, but once it dropped 
to a frigid 31, causing my shoe covers to freeze solid to the pedals. I freed 
myself, but soon after my feet froze to the pedals once again and I decided to 
turn around and head for home. 
</P>
<P>
I continued to ride in the coming days, but looked forward to the day when the 
sun would shine bright and warm. Soon it was April and a heat wave was upon us. 
We had 60s for highs and I was in heaven. Now I could begin my 33-mile ride 
through the park -- for me, one of the main objectives of our stay there. 
Cycling and cave exploration are two of the area's favored pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
In a remote corner of northeast California, Lava Beds was born centuries ago 
when volcanoes spewed enormous amounts of molten basaltic lava over the area. 
The rivers of lava cooled and hardened, creating a rugged landscape where today 
you can cycle, explore caves, climb cinder cones, observe wildlife and follow 
the steps of those who fought in the Modoc War between the Modoc Indians and 
the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
Established as a National Monument on Nov. 21, 1925, Lava Beds is about 30 
miles south of the town of Tulelake in Siskiyou County. Two paved roads lead to 
the 72-square-mile park, whose visitor center is open year-round. 
</P>
<P>
I began my ride that day about 26 miles north of the town of Canby, at the 
junction of California Highway 139 and the Forest Service road that leads 
northwest from the highway to the park. Most of the route from here is rolling 
terrain. I suggest starting at this end, with a pickup arranged at the north 
end of the park. 
</P>
<P>
The climbing is steeper in the other direction -- north to south -- but if you 
like that, the north entrance is located off Highway 139, about five miles 
south of Tulelake. 
</P>
<P>
The road is fairly flat for the first 12 miles of this ride, skirting through 
flatlands blanketed with a rich cover of sagebrush and bitterbrush, here and 
there a lonely pine. In the distance are the high mountain peaks of the Cascade 
Range; nearby, the blunt heads of several buttes rise like a freshly baked 
souffle. Deer are plentiful, as well as pronghorn antelope and a variety of 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
The road edges upward as you reach the southern boundary of the park. Winding 
along the base of Cougar and Caldwell buttes, the turnoff to Valentine Cave 
soon appears, a must-see for all spelunkers and cavers. 
</P>
<P>
Just 16 miles from my starting point is the visitor center, which lends lights 
to cavers free of charge. Cyclists will find a bike rack and restrooms open all 
day, every day of the year. Inside, there is a small museum, books and other 
items for sale, friendly park personnel and free information about 
ranger-guided activities, wildlife and cave exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Mushpot Cave, an extension of the visitor center, is the only lighted cave in 
the park. A self-guided walk explains features formed during the births of 
caves. At Mushpot, you'll learn to recognize lavacicles, lava benches and lava 
cascades. 
</P>
<P>
There are 21 developed caves (safety checked and with paths cleared) available 
for exploration in the park, as well as more than 100 wilderness caves. 
Excluding Mushpot, there are 14 caves located southwest of the visitor center, 
off two-mile-long Cave Loop Road, each with something different to offer. 
Sunshine Cave will delight plant enthusiasts -- a variety of plants flourish in 
collapse areas in which sunshine has penetrated the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
At Sentenial Cave, look for the natural bridge on your right as you enter 
through the Upper Sentinel entrance. And notice the cave walls and ceilings in 
Golden Dome and Hopkins Chocolate caves. 
</P>
<P>
Skull Cave can be described in many ways, but I would say it is mind-boggling. 
It's also a fun ride from the visitor center to the cave. Except for a short 
climb, it's all downhill. To reach the cave, ride, as I did, two miles north of 
the visitor center to Lyons Road, turn right, then cycle a little more than a 
mile to the end of the road. You can't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
With a ceiling more than 80 feet high, Skull Cave possesses the largest 
entrance of any cave in the monument. As you walk through this 500-foot-long 
cave, notice that the floor of the upper tube collapses into a lower tube where 
trapped winter air keeps ice frozen all year. Sixty-five steps lead to the 
chilly lower tube. 
</P>
<P>
If exploring ice caves is to your liking, you'll want to visit Merrill Cave. 
Back on the main road, cycle north about a half-mile to Whitney Butte Trailhead 
Road and turn left. In less than a mile you'll reach the end of the road, and 
the cave. 
</P>
<P>
Before turning off the main road, notice Schonchin Butte on your right. If 
you're so inclined, you can hike the three-quarter-mile trail to the top of the 
butte, a 476-foot climb. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists heading north through Lava Beds are traversing a historically rich 
area. There are pictographs (figures painted on rocks somewhere between AD 500 
and 1600) at Symbol Bridge and Big Painted caves, and petroglyphs (figures 
carved or pecked into the rock surface) near the northeast entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling north, I couldn't resist the urge to stop at the many sites of the 
Modoc War of 1872-73. At the Thomas-Wright Battlefield, descriptive markers 
explain how a small band of Modoc Indians ambushed army soldiers, killing half 
the troop. 
</P>
<P>
Farther on, I cycled down through a giant lava flow, then stopped at Gillem's 
Camp. There, I imagined an active army camp, tents pitched on the rugged 
terrain, the waters of Tule Lake lapping nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Heading east now, along the northern boundary of Lava Beds and the southern 
edge of the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge, I stopped at Canby's Cross for 
a bite to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The historical sites I had just passed, and those ahead of me, describe the 
only major Indian war fought in California. Canby's Cross takes its name from 
General E.R.S. Canby, who was shot and killed at the site during peace 
negotiations between the Modocs and the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
The area and the land to the north had been the Modocs' home for centuries, 
when they were asked to move to a reservation with Indians who were their 
traditional enemies. The Modocs initially agreed to the unwelcome arrangement, 
but it didn't last. They soon left the reservation, led by Modoc chief Captain 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter part of 1872, the U.S. Army ordered the Modocs to return to the 
reservation. Instead, they fled to Lava Beds, and for five months, Captain Jack 
and his band of 52 warriors held off a growing U.S. Army of nearly 1,000 men. 
</P>
<P>
Taunted by fellow Indians, and angry over the fact that his people would not be 
granted a reservation on their homeland, Captain Jack shot and killed Canby. 
</P>
<P>
As I got back on my bike and continued riding east, I wondered how a handful of 
Modocs were able to hold off so many soldiers. At Captain Jack's Stronghold, I 
found the answer -- the rugged, inhospitable terrain. 
</P>
<P>
You can relive the Modoc War as you travel through this natural rock fortress. 
A self-guided brochure (available at the visitor center or at the trail head) 
provides clues to how the Modocs survived. In the end, though, the Modocs were 
captured and sent to a reservation in Oklahoma; Captain Jack and three other 
leaders were hanged. 
</P>
<P>
As I neared the end of my warm, sunny ride, I stopped at two wildlife overlooks 
and gazed at flocks of geese flying overhead in V-formation, chattering all the 
while. I peered through the small magnified tunnels of binoculars at a bald 
eagle perched in a lonely snag tree. On an island in Tule Lake to the 
northeast, several white pelicans were preening, their giant wings spread wider 
than a man is tall. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of the wildlife I had seen during my ride: the deer by the roadside, 
the badger rolling across the level terrain, three bald eagles and a golden 
eagle soaring high above. 
</P>
<P>
I had laughed at the antics of a porcupine waddling across the road, then 
slowly climbing up a sticky juniper tree, and marveled at the hunting 
techniques of a northern harrier, also known as a marsh hawk. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment I realized that a ride through Lava Beds is great any time of 
the year. But it's best when the days are a little warm and long. Then, it's 
like a little bit of heaven.

CRUISE VIEWS: NEW SHIP EXPLORES SEAS UNDER FLAG OF ECOLOGY

LAMOTREK ATOLL, Caroline Islands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ecotourism doesn't mean much to the handful of Micronesian villagers who stand 
on the beach watching us arrive in rubber landing craft at their tiny island in 
the central Pacific near the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
We are about 90 travelers -- American, Japanese, German, Swiss, Australian, 
Canadian, Brazilian and British -- temporarily disembarked from a ship being 
billed as the world's "first environment-friendly expedition ship" and the 
possible "model of non-polluting ships to come." We are on the inaugural voyage 
of Salen Lindblad Cruising's brand-new Frontier Spirit, a 164-passenger vessel 
that left Guam for Papua New Guinea on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
We learn we are carrying the aspects of civilization that interest the 
Micronesians most -- cold Coca-Colas, filter-tipped cigarettes and an engineer 
who can repair their broken generator so they can again watch videos on the VCR 
attached to the community's one television set. 
</P>
<P>
But they would probably be unimpressed, should they venture below deck, by our 
ship's state-of-the-art systems for disposing of garbage without spoiling the 
environment, because garbage is something these people don't have. 
</P>
<P>
They use everything the sea or others bring to their shores. Remains of crashed 
World War II Japanese fighter planes make shelters for dogs and chickens; 
Japanese plastic fishing floats, cut in half, are handy as food dishes for 
chickens and pigs; washed-up bottles store rainwater or make ornamental borders 
around family graves, and pieces of plywood and corrugated metal are 
incorporated into the walls of their thatch-roof houses. 
</P>
<P>
Such is not the case with cruise ships, however, even luxurious expedition 
vessels filled with passengers passionate about saving the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the Frontier Spirit, however, a corner of consciousness has been turned. 
Instead of bingo, we have lectures on identifying sea birds or how a coral reef 
is formed. Instead of floor shows or dancing after dinner, we may watch 
National Geographic videos about sharks or life on atolls. 
</P>
<P>
And no future archeologist is likely to find any clues we passed by here on the 
way south toward the delicate and threatened ecosystem of Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier Spirit was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan, the 
first expedition ship to be created in 26 years. Reflecting the new attitude of 
ecologically aware tourism, it carries one crew member who is solely 
responsible for separating and processing shipboard garbage into 
environmentally acceptable components. 
</P>
<P>
In one machine, glass is smashed into tiny fragments that are sifted and 
released into the sea, where they settle on the sand to be additionally 
pulverized by nature. Paper is compressed into small packets and burned in the 
incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
Another machine shreds and grinds metal into easy-to-store fragments that are 
held in a special compartment with compacted plastics to be returned to 
disembarkation ports. 
</P>
<P>
Food garbage is compacted into small bales, with all liquid removed, and what 
can be burned is disposed of in the incinerator. The rest is stored in an 
air-tight refrigerated compartment until it can be off-loaded at a port that 
can handle such garbage. 
</P>
<P>
There is an oil separator in the ship's bilge system that removes the waste 
oil, which is then burned in the incinerator, while the water is returned to 
the bilge. The ship uses only marine-diesel or gas-oil, cleaner fuels than the 
heavy-duty bunker or sea oil that most ships use. 
</P>
<P>
A fresh-water vacuum toilet system throughout the vessel requires less water to 
operate, according to the cruise line, than usual shipboard systems. The waste 
is transferred to a sewage treatment plant, where it is mixed with 
hydrochloride before being discharged into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its waste-disposal features, the Frontier Spirit carries a higher 
ice-class rating (an ability to cut through five feet of ice) than any other 
expedition ship currently in service, according to veteran Capt. Heinz Aye. It 
is also the largest expedition ship, according to Aye, who has made 59 
Antarctic cruises and two transits of the Northwest Passage. 
</P>
<P>
Passage on the Frontier Spirit costs about $320 a day per person, double 
occupancy, plus air fare, for a standard double cabin. Deluxe cabins and suites 
are about $490 per day and private verandas about $420 per day. 
</P>
<P>
A glass-windowed, forward, observation lounge and library serves as a 
before-dinner meeting place for commentary from our resident naturalists about 
the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
There's a swimming pool, sunbathing decks, a gym, sauna, beauty shop and a free 
self-service Laundromat with a drying room. 
</P>
<P>
All cabins contain twin or queen-sized beds, sitting areas, view windows, hair 
dryers, mini-refrigerators, tiled baths with showers, color TV with remote 
control and a generous storage area. Stewardesses and dining-room waiters are 
European, and the menu is continental from Austrian executive chef Franz 
Sledak, former chef aboard Cunard's Sagafjord and QE2. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming itineraries include a 27-day Antarctica sailing beginning Jan. 31 to 
Ross Ice Shelf and McMurdo Sound; a 17-day voyage around Australia's Great 
Barrier Reef starting April 2, and an 18-day Papua New Guinea itinerary April 
14. The three-day Alaska/Northwest Passage sailing is scheduled Aug. 18.

SEEKING, AND FINDING, THE ROMANCE OF MEXICO IN MODERN GUADALAJARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

GUADALAJARA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mariachi music was born in Guadalajara, and the rollicking, foot-tapping tunes 
of Mexico's popular folk minstrels still dance through the historic city's 
cobbled streets as if every day is a fiesta. Listen to the music, and you may 
quickly succumb, as I did, to the city's old-fashioned charm. 
</P>
<P>
We tourists often travel in search of illusions, and in Guadalajara, I found 
the romantic Mexico of my imagination. 
</P>
<P>
One lazy afternoon, my wife and I lunched in a flower-scented garden where 
peacocks begged crumbs and the waiter plucked ripe sweet guavas for us from the 
tree shading our table. I awoke daily to the sound of the cathedral bells, 
pealing their morning greeting as they have for almost four centuries. 
</P>
<P>
We peeked into the loveliest of the city's many Spanish-colonial buildings, 
invariably finding quiet courtyards where fountains splashed in a profusion of 
bougainvillea, oleander and bright red hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
Twice we all but got lost in the crowded passageways of the city's sprawling 
Liberty Market, where we had gone in search of the decorative pottery for which 
the region is famous. At sunset, we lingered over tequila sours at a sidewalk 
cafe or joined the crowds strolling the city's splendidly formal plazas. 
</P>
<P>
Magicians, folk dancers and other street performers entertained. On our last 
night, we took a long horse-drawn carriage ride through the old city, waving at 
Mexican families who waved back at us from their carriages. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite memory, though, is the Saturday afternoon we chanced upon a 
mariachi concert in Tlaquepaque, a picturesque little village within 
Guadalajara's borders that is noted for fine pottery and other handicrafts. We 
had just emerged from a shop when I heard the unmistakable chorus of blaring 
trumpets and squealing violins. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a great fan of mariachi music, so off we went in pursuit of the boisterous 
sound, joined by almost everybody else on the street. A fiesta was in the 
making, and we weren't about to miss it. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalajara is perhaps an unusual destination for a Mexican getaway, since it 
is nowhere near an ocean beach. The nearest beach resort is Puerto Vallarta, a 
long and arduous drive away. 
</P>
<P>
I was intrigued more by Guadalajara's lively colonial history and a reputation 
as Mexico's "most Mexican" city -- an indication that I would see more local 
folk than fellow Americans on the streets. The fact that the latest edition of 
the Encyclopedia Americana -- a good resource I always consult before I travel 
-- calls it "one of the most attractive of North American cities" clinched my 
decision to go. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalajara sits in a high, sweeping valley about 300 miles northwest of the 
capital of Mexico City. At an elevation of 5,141 feet, it enjoys a dry, 
pleasantly mild climate throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Although we visited there on a long weekend in August, we left our hotel 
windows open at night to enjoy the cool breezes -- which, of course, is why I 
heard the cathedral bells at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
The cathedral's anthem was politely followed -- in deference to its age perhaps 
-- by the ringing echoes of first one and then another of the city's other 
churches. I found the bells a gentle enough alarm clock. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalajara is Mexico's second-largest city, but this statistic can be 
misleading. Mexico City is swamped by a population that may exceed 20 million. 
Guadalajara's is only a quarter of that, at 5 million, and so far the city has 
managed to escape the oppressive congestion of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the historic colonial district, where traffic is banned from some 
streets and few structures rise above two stories, you might easily imagine 
yourself in a small (though sophisticated) village. 
</P>
<P>
It is a very old city and a historical one, founded by the Spanish 
conquistadors in 1542, a good 78 years before the Pilgrims established Plymouth 
Colony in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
A regional capital, it was the jumping-off place for the Spanish exploration of 
California and other Spanish colonies in what is now the United States. Father 
Junipero Serra, who founded the first nine of California's 21 Franciscan 
missions, made his departure from Guadalajara in 1767. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Spanish Guadalajara has disappeared, but in the past decade city 
officials have acted to preserve the colonial integrity of the historic 
district -- an area of several square blocks in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
We picked our hotel, the comfortable little De Mendoza, because of its location 
within the district. It's nestled against one of the city's finest old chapels, 
the ornate Santa Maria de Gracia, a popular choice for weddings. I caught 
glimpses of at least three formal bridal processions from my third-floor 
window. 
</P>
<P>
Large parts of the historic district are off-limits to vehicles, which makes it 
ideal for sightseeing on foot. 
</P>
<P>
I found it an impressive place, a sort of architectural garden where a 
collection of handsome gray stone buildings and baroque-style churches are 
displayed amid broad plazas and well-tended gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A modern element in the district that enhances rather than detracts is the 
seven-block-long Plaza Tapatia, an inviting pedestrian mall completed eight 
years ago. It is graced with arcades, fountains, hand-wrought iron lamps and 
statuary -- monumental and whimsical alike. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza is an attractive link between two of Guadalajara's historical 
treasures, the cathedral and the Cabanas Cultural Institute. On our way from 
one to the other, we stopped for apricot-flavored ice cream cones at Helados 
Bing, a modern ice cream parlor tucked into one of the arcades -- yet another 
of the charms of Plaza Tapatia. 
</P>
<P>
The 16th-Century cathedral, its twin towers decorated in tiles of blue and 
yellow, dominates the western edge of the historic district near the 
intersection of two major shopping streets, Avenida 16 de Septiembre and 
Avenida Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
On the eastern edge, about a dozen blocks away via Plaza Tapatia, is the 
Cabanas Cultural Institute, occupying a former orphanage that was the largest 
colonial structure ever built in the Americas. It's a delightful, six-acre 
sprawl that hides -- by official count -- 23 charming patios. In one, we 
watched a group of eager youngsters learning local folk dances to mariachi 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
We spent most of a full day exploring the historic district, ate traditional 
Mexican meals within walking distance of the hotel and joined the evening 
crowds promenading on the Plaza Tapatia and the other adjacent squares. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalajara's handsome 19th-Century theater, the Degollado Theater, overlooks 
one of them, the Plaza de La Liberacion. One night, the theater drew a 
glamorous tuxedo- and gown-clad crowd to a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, 
which was visiting. The group added to the elegance of the colonial structures 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
We found it easy to poke our noses into most of the old buildings, many of 
which house government offices. Built mostly of gray stone, they present a 
solid, imposing exterior. 
</P>
<P>
But it's all a bluff. Inside, the buildings are far more inviting than they may 
seem. Arched walls encircle delightful gardens and cool, quiet courtyards 
decorated with sprightly fountains, wrought-iron balconies and tiled walkways. 
Orange trees, a local symbol, flourish among palms and other semitropical 
foliage. I liked to sit for a moment and soak in the aura of earlier centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In our rambles, we inevitably reached the Government Palace, a large 
18th-Century colonial structure that faces the neatly manicured Plaza de Armas. 
We stepped inside, anticipating more of the pleasant courtyards that so 
appealed to us. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we were all but stunned by a massive and fiery mural sweeping across 
the ceiling directly above us. It is the work of Jose Clemente Orozco, Mexico's 
famed artist. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in the late 1930s, it depicts Father Hidalgo, a Mexican revolutionary 
who in 1810 proclaimed the end of slavery from this very building. Carrying a 
burning torch, Father Hidalgo glares down in unrelenting anger -- probably 
well-justified by the injustices of Mexico's colonial past. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Museum of Guadalajara, on the north side of the Plaza de La 
Liberacion, occupies yet another fine old colonial building, once a seminary. I 
don't know whether I was more taken by its quiet, pillar-ringed courtyards or 
the exhibits of colorful Indian costumes on display. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, we would chance upon a group of folk dancers dressed in similar 
attire performing for the street crowds on the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
We concluded the day's history lesson with lunch at Cafe Sandy, a second-floor 
restaurant with balcony tables overlooking the museum entrance and the colorful 
street scene. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalajara is famed for its traditional dishes -- tacos, tostadas, gorditas 
(meat pies) and pozole, a hominy soup -- most of which were on Sandy's menu. I 
opted for a chicken tostada and hot sauce. A large lunch for two, including 
beer, cost about $14, reflecting the generally moderate prices in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, we headed for Liberty Market, reportedly the largest public market 
under one roof in Latin America. About three square blocks in size, it stands 
just outside the historic district at its eastern end, easily within walking of 
the Hotel De Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
The place is intimidating at first, a vast and confusing arena jammed to 
overflowing with individual shops selling almost everything from fresh fruits 
and meats to sombreros and hand-crafted guitars. We went in search of 
hand-painted pottery, which we found in overwhelming array. We had been advised 
to bargain, but the prices were so low already I didn't have the heart. 
</P>
<P>
On our last day in Guadalajara, we ventured beyond the historic district to 
visit two nearby artisans' villages, Tonala and Tlaquepaque. 
</P>
<P>
We might have gone by bus or taxi, but instead we hired a licensed guide with a 
car for the morning at about $12 an hour for four hours -- a reasonable charge, 
and not much more than what a taxi would have cost for the same trip. The 
villages are each about a 25-minute drive from the center of the city and 
perhaps 15 minutes from each other. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Tlaquepaque, Tonala has not yet been gobbled up by growing Guadalajara. 
To reach it, you ride through a bit of open countryside, where cattle graze in 
green fields. 
</P>
<P>
By outward appearances, Tonala is a typical country village. Adobe buildings, 
painted in pastel shades, line dusty, cobblestone streets -- all of which seem 
to lead to the central plaza and the community church. 
</P>
<P>
But Tonala is noted for its numerous, small family-run pottery factories, which 
produce a variety of colorful ceramics -- plates, animal figurines, tall vases 
and deep bowls. Much of the work is quite good, though some of it obviously is 
junk. 
</P>
<P>
Tonala is popular with the local folks, our guide told us, because prices are 
inexpensive. She shopped for a small gift for a friend, while we toured the 
shops to see what they offered. On Thursdays and Sundays, vendors from 
surrounding communities flock to the village, displaying handmade baskets and 
other handicrafts on blankets spread on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
There is homespun authenticity to the pottery trade in Tonala. But the best 
ceramics in the region are found in Tlaquepaque, a considerably more upscale 
neighborhood that once served as a country resort for wealthy families of 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Several shops along Calle Independencia, an attractive pedestrian promenade, 
occupy the former homes of these aristocrats. Many of the buildings enclose 
pleasant gardens. We toured the shops as much to see the interior of the old 
homes as the merchandise. A hand-painted vase, signed by the artist, may cost 
several hundred dollars, although much cheaper pieces also are available. 
</P>
<P>
One of the region's finest restaurants, the No Name Restaurant, is just a few 
steps off Calle Independencia, and we sought it out for a late lunch after 
dismissing our guide. 
</P>
<P>
At least, we thought we were eating late at 1:30 p.m. Actually, we had arrived 
early by Guadalajaran standards. The restaurant really didn't fill all its 
tables until about 3, when we were leaving. With time on their hands, the 
waiters picked guavas from the trees, sharing them with us. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help but like the restaurant. It was the romantic Old Mexico of my 
dreams. We dined outdoors in a tiled garden courtyard shaded by banana trees, 
bamboo and other lush foliage. Peacocks strutted past, and a guitarist 
serenaded us. 
</P>
<P>
The table was set with ceramic ware from a prestigious shop next door. To all 
appearances, we had stepped back into the 18th Century. Lunch was as satisfying 
as the setting. I ordered a small grilled steak topped with sweet pecan sauce. 
A complete lunch for two, with beer, came to about $40. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, we strolled the streets of Tlaquepaque for awhile longer, reluctant 
to leave. I ducked into a ceramics shop to buy a souvenir of our visit, and 
when I emerged I heard the mariachi band warming up in the plaza. The concert 
was just getting under way in a large, tree-shaded plaza ringed by more 
open-air restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
All the restaurants had tables, maybe hundreds of them, spilling at random 
almost to the edge of a circular bandstand, which commanded the center of the 
plaza. On stage, a large mariachi group in traditional bolero jacket, tight 
black pants and silver trim played with the robust spirit the music invites. 
The tables filled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the concert was a family affair -- large multi-generational families 
taking a dozen seats or more around the tables. Waiters scurried, carrying 
trays heaped with spicy dishes, steins of good Mexican beer and fruit drinks. 
Youngsters in fancy party clothes skipped to the beat, and the grown-ups called 
for their favorite pieces and applauded enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
I sipped my beer, listened to the tunes and watched the happy crowd around me.

Mariachi is the music of Old Guadalajara, and I was in the mood for a fiesta. 
If you travel with romantic dreams, why wake up before you have to?

Getting there: American Airlines' least expensive unrestricted, one-way fare 
from Los Angeles to Guadalajara is $317, stopping in Dallas. On Continental 
($222), you change planes in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicana's lowest fare is $172, Monday through Friday, nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
When to go: Summer is the rainy season, humid but mild because of the altitude. 
Fall is invariably crisp, dry and sunny. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Several luxury hotels, including the Fiesta Americana and El 
Tapatio, are located inconveniently on the outskirts of town. We chose to stay, 
instead, in the heart of the historic district at the delightful Hotel De 
Mendoza. Its restaurant is good and moderately priced, with a menu about 
equally divided between Mexican and international dishes. A room for two is 
about $70 a night (tax included) in the winter high season, $46 a night the 
rest of the year. For reservations: Mexico Tours, Albuquerque, N.M., (800) 
255-8482. 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Guadalajara has many fine restaurants serving the world's 
cuisines. We were interested in Mexican dishes, which were available 
practically everywhere. The Copa de Leche on Avenida Juarez, one of 
Guadalajara's old favorites, offers a Mexican menu on its mezzanine and 
continental dishes on the first level. The restaurant is about a 10-minute walk 
across the historic district from the De Mendoza. A full dinner for two is 
about $30.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS;

<P>
TIP TO INFREQUENT FLIER 
</P>

Question: Although I don't travel frequently, does it make sense to join an 
airline frequent-flier program? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Even if you never earn enough mileage to collect an award, signing up 
generally will put you on the airline's mailing list for special offers that 
are extended to program members, but not always to the general public. These 
offers include travel, cruise, hotel and car-rental discounts. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've noticed more and more hotels are offering concierge or executive-level 
floors. What is the difference between these and the rest of the hotel, and how 
do the prices compare? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many concierge and executive floors have separate check-in areas, plus 
private lounges and meeting facilities. While room size may not be different, 
these rooms typically have the latest amenities, with some including a 
complimentary continental breakfast, newspapers and sometimes a cocktail hour. 
Expect to pay between $20 and $80 extra per night. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One day the airlines add fuel surcharges, reasoning the price of jet fuel 
has gone up. The next day I see they are cutting fares. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
A: The fare cut you're speaking of was mainly limited to European destinations 
for the winter months, when vacation travel slows down and the airlines try to 
lure extra business by lowering prices. However, as the price of jet fuel rises 
substantially, fuel surcharges also apply to these fares. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will there be a charge if I cancel a hotel reservation that is guaranteed by 
credit card before 6 p.m. the day I'm due? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hotels have varying cancellation policies that may require cancellation 
notice anywhere from 24 hours to seven days to avoid a charge for the room. 
Also, it is advisable to cancel directly with the hotel rather than a national 
800 number. Get a cancellation confirmation number. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With costs high in Europe, where's the best place to change dollars into 
local currency? 
</P>
<P>
A: Change most of your dollars in Europe, but remember that hotels generally 
give less favorable rates than banks. Traveler's checks can bring a better rate 
because less paperwork is involved. Also check local currency brokers who often 
are competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When is the Mozart Festival in New York City and what's taking place? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some 500 events are scheduled at the city's Lincoln Center, from Jan. 27, 
1991, to Aug. 29, 1992, from opera to films to chamber music. During the 
festival, the complete works of Mozart will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We're traveling to Western Europe. Is a health insurance policy advisable? 
</P>
<P>
A: If your current policy doesn't cover accidents or illness abroad, such 
protection is always advisable. Emergency medical treatment or air evacuation 
can be costly. Consult your insurance broker or travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are Soviet cruise ships still banned from American ports? If not, is there a 
likelihood of their resuming soon? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Soviets are interested in entering the cruise trade in the United States 
in the near future and are discussing deals that will add several new vessels 
to their fleet.

CONSUMER REPORT: DUTY-FREE LIMITATIONS RAISED FOR TRAVELERS; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTOMS: AMERICANS CAN BRING MORE ITEMS HOME WITHOUT BEING TAXED NOW THAT THE 
DUTY-FREE LIMIT FROM MOST CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES HAS BEEN RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There was good news recently for travelers who like to shop: U.S. Customs has 
raised the dollar limit on duty-free goods that travelers can bring back to the 
United States from most countries in the Caribbean, as well as parts of Central 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
The new duty-free limit when returning from U.S. possessions such as the U.S. 
Virgin Islands in the Caribbean is $1,200, up from $800, and applies to 
travelers who left the United States on or after Sept. 4, 1990. For most other 
Caribbean islands, most countries in Central America and one South American 
country (Guiana), the limit has risen to $600 from $400. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the $400 limit still applies for travelers returning from other 
foreign countries, there can be some confusion. The duty-free limit on goods 
you bring home depends on which country was your last stop before landing in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the U.S. Virgin Islands, other destinations affected by the new $1,200 
limits are Guam and American Samoa in the Pacific. There is no duty paid on 
items purchased in Puerto Rico, since it is an American commonwealth treated 
almost like another state. 
</P>
<P>
The new $600 allowance for Caribbean-basin destinations includes Antigua and 
Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, 
Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, the Netherlands Antilles (Aruba, Bonaire and 
Curacao), St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
In Central America, the new limit applies to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an example of what happens when your itinerary includes countries from 
different parts of the world: If you went to Great Britain and then the 
Bahamas, you could get the $600 duty-free exemption, as allowed for the 
Bahamas, as long as not more than $400 of your items were acquired in Great 
Britain. In this scenario, you would have to return to the United States 
directly from the Bahamas to claim the higher exemption. 
</P>
<P>
If this scenario were reversed and you returned to the United States from Great 
Britain, you would then be eligible only for the $400 exemption. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, to receive the $600 exemption from a Caribbean-basin 
destination, you must return directly from that country to the United States. 
In the case of U.S. possessions, you can receive the new $1,200 exemption even 
if you return to the United States via another country. 
</P>
<P>
If your itinerary embraces, say, St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 
Mexico, you're entitled to the $1,200 exemption as long as not more than $400 
of your items were obtained in Mexico and at least $600 were acquired from St. 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
There are also new U.S. Customs allowances for bringing in liquor from the 
Caribbean-basin destinations. Travelers can now bring back two liters of 
alcoholic beverages without paying duty or taxes as long as at least one liter 
is the product of one or more of the destinations covered. Previously, the 
duty-free limit was one liter. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're coming back from a U.S. possession, you can bring back up to five 
liters of alcohol as long as one of the liters was made in the country you 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new liquor allowance rules are moot for visitors returning 
directly to California since Customs also enforces the liquor laws of the state 
in which travelers return, which might be stricter than the federal rules. 
California allows travelers to bring back only one liter of alcohol; any more 
will be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
But if a traveler returned to Los Angeles via New York or Houston, "We would 
follow the liquor laws of New York and Texas, which would be the first points 
of entry in the United States," said U.S. Customs spokesman Tom Nanasy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also helps more than 70 developing countries around the world 
by permitting some of their products to be brought in duty-free as part of the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. Such items must be purchased 
in the nation that made them. 
</P>
<P>
"These items wouldn't count toward any exemption," Nanasy explained. 
</P>
<P>
If you are planning any extensive shopping abroad, two free brochures are 
helpful: "GSP &amp; the Traveler" and "Know Before You Go." Both are available 
from U.S. Customs, 1301 Constitution Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229. Or call 
Customs direct, locally, at (213) 215-2414. 
</P>
<P>
If you happen to go over the duty-free allowance, there is a flat rate of 10% 
duty on the first $1,000, with the rate then going up based on the specific 
article. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe that you've been charged duty in error, your recourse is to talk 
to the appropriate supervisor on hand. Documentation is vital. Keep receipts 
handy. If you can't resolve the dispute, fill out a written petition for a 
review to determine whether you should get a refund. 
</P>
<P>
And if your goods are damaged while being inspected by Customs, you can always 
file a claim, using Form SP95, against the U.S. government.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: AIRLINE COUPON BOOKS OFFER A GOOD WAY TO FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's important to comparison-shop when purchasing airline coupon books, which 
can be a good deal for the mature traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Nine carriers now sell the discount coupon books to those age 62 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Each coupon, sold in four- and eight-coupon books, is good for a one-way coach 
trip at significantly reduced rates. Most can be purchased at an airline office 
or by mail. Travel agents can accept orders but cannot issue books; they must 
be sent by mail. 
</P>
<P>
There are restrictions on the coupons and significant differences between the 
coupons offered by various airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Like all deep discount fares, senior coupon travel is "capacity controlled," 
which means only a limited number of seats are reserved on each flight for use 
by coupon holders. Thus, early reservations and the flexibility to shift travel 
plans are important. 
</P>
<P>
In general, reservations must be made 14 days in advance, travel is restricted 
to midweek and the coupons are not valid on holidays. 
</P>
<P>
A coupon is good for each one-way flight, including connections, only on the 
issuing carrier and its affiliated commuter lines. And the coupons are good for 
a limited period of time -- usually one year from date of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Just because a coupon book has the lowest price tag doesn't mean it's the best 
buy. Check the carrier to see if it flies to the places you are most likely to 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Don't use a four-coupon book for travel to Hawaii from the West Coast. Since 
all carriers require two coupons each way, other Hawaii package trips usually 
offer a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact that some carriers put a 2,000-mile cap on each coupon, you 
must use two coupons for long flights, such as from the West Coast to the East. 
Continental does not have a mileage cap, nor do Delta, Northwest and USAir. TWA 
imposes a mileage cap from mid-May to mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a brief list of the nine carriers and major variations: 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines: Four coupons for $420; eight, $720; 2,000-mile cap; two 
coupons for flights from Los Angeles to Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
America West: Lowest priced, with four for $348; eight, $598. This competitive 
edge is offset by the fact that America West serves fewer destinations than any 
of the other airlines offering coupon books. 
</P>
<P>
Continental: Four for $384; eight, $640. No mileage cap. Two coupons for 
flights to Hawaii and Alaska. May be purchased through travel agents, but books 
come through the mail 10 days to two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Delta: Four for $420; eight, $720. No mileage cap, two coupons required each 
way for travel from Los Angeles to Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern: Four for $368; eight, $616. Good in the continental United States, 
plus San Juan and the Virgin Islands. Seniors can also purchase books for a 
companion of any age, as long as they both travel together. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest: Four for $384; eight, $640. Good in the continental United States 
and its Canadian destinations. Two coupons for travel to Hawaii and Alaska. You 
may also purchase one $96 bonus coupon for a companion of any age. To purchase 
coupons, you must be a member of Northwest's World Horizons Club, but the $50 
membership fee is returned in a flight coupon. 
</P>
<P>
TWA: Four-coupon book for $379, with optional fifth coupon for one round-trip 
flight to Europe at $449 or $649, depending on the season. Mileage cap only in 
summer. No coupon travel to Hawaii from May 15 to Sept. 15; two coupons per 
flight, otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
United: Four for $420; eight, $704. Mileage cap and two coupons per flight for 
Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
USAir: Four for $420; eight, $704. No mileage cap but two coupons per flight 
for Hawaii and Alaska.

YOUTH BEAT: TWO NEW EUROPEAN RAIL PASSES ALLOW GREATER FLEXIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting Jan. 1, 1991, two new types of Eurail Youthpasses will be available to 
travelers under 26. And it won't be necessary to hit the rails daily to take 
full advantage of their value. 
</P>
<P>
For years, younger travelers have purchased one- or two-month Eurail 
Youthpasses that allow transit in the second-class section of trains in any of 
17 European countries. 
</P>
<P>
But to get as much value as possible from the ticket, it was necessary to race 
from one city to the next, trying to cover as much ground as possible during 
the alloted time. 
</P>
<P>
The new Flexi Youthpasses encourage a slower pace. With the 15-day Flexi 
Youthpass, the traveler can journey second-class throughout the 17-country 
network on any 15 days within a three-month period. A second version will allow 
travel on any 30 days within a three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for the Flexi Youthpasses have not yet been determined, but as with all 
other Eurail tickets, they will have to be purchased from travel agents before 
leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
For those who decide they prefer the regular one- or two-month Youthpasses, 
keep in mind that rates usually increase on Jan. 1. At present, the one-month 
ticket costs $380 and two months cost $500, so you may want to buy now. If you 
do, you must begin to use the pass within six months of the date you buy it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reduced prices, "unlimited" rail passes offer another advantage: 
If you are really stuck for a place to stay at night, you can hop aboard a 
train. 
</P>
<P>
For example, with a pass for second-class travel, you can get on a train in 
Amsterdam at 4 p.m. and get off at 9 a.m. in Florence. Or you can board a train 
in Paris at 9 p.m. and arrive in Rome before 2 p.m. the next day. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're willing to pay about $20 more, you can stretch out in a berth in 
a six-bunk compartment. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find it easier to anticipate the distance you can comfortably cover by 
asking for a free copy of "Through Europe By Train," which should be available 
through the agent who sells you the pass. The book contains time tables and 
connections for some of the most popular routes throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Major stations will have large computerized boards that display 
arrival/departure times and track numbers. Detailed schedule boards will tell 
you where you should be and when to catch the train you want. Keep in mind that 
large cities will have more than one rail station. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting on board, check the plaque beside the door. Not all cars on a 
train will go to the same destination. Some trains will switch cars at stations 
along their route. The plaques by the doors indicate where each car should wind 
up. 
</P>
<P>
And to save additional money, plan to carry your own water and pack a snack.

MYTHS OF FEMALE WEAKNESS; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T KNOCK THE SAUDIS. IT CAN BE ROUGH FOR WOMEN HERE, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The images from the sands of Saudi Arabia offer a stark contrast: American 
servicewomen work in fatigues, while Saudi women are glimpsed briefly, shrouded 
head to toe in the veil. While the Americans were driving heavy equipment, a 
group of some 40 Saudi women staged a protest -- dismissing their drivers and 
piloting their luxury cars through the streets of downtown Riyadh. Their 
demand? The right to drive, forbidden to women in their country. From all 
appearances, it's the modern, liberated society vs. the Middle Ages, as far as 
women are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
But before we Americans start congratulating ourselves on how liberated we are, 
we might check recent headlines. Nobody's asking American women to dress from 
head to toe in black, but the mythology about women as "the other," in her 
strange and wondrous forms, has hardly vanished from the landscape. Peculiar 
notions about woman -- as flawed weakling, sexual predator, neglectful mommy or 
breed mare -- float about like toxic smoke as the subtext of recent 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the incident in which a female sportswriter was surrounded in 
the locker room of the New England Patriots by naked players, who made obscene 
comments and suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cries of outrage were directed at the victim. Patriots' fans 
screamed obscenities at sportswriter Lisa Olson as she walked into the stadium. 
A Cincinnati coach declared people were tired of bitches and bra-burners; some 
players said their wives didn't like the idea of women in the locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The implication of sexual threat -- or misbehavior -- by women lurked behind 
all of these comments. Does a woman "ask for it" if she goes about her job 
wearing something less body-obscuring than the veil? The notion that any woman 
who strays from proper female territory into male turf is a sexual aggressor 
and deserves any punishment she might encounter may be ancient history -- but 
it's not as dead as we thought. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking other women to validate the alleged threat should also be ancient 
history. Do players' wives really worry about sportswriters -- when motel 
lobbies are filled with nubile groupies whose self-esteem is so low that they 
need to prove they are somebody by sleeping with celebrities? Do wives really 
believe that a sportswriter is rushing into the locker room each night worried 
not about a good quote to lead the next day's story, but breathless for a peek 
at sweaty, half-naked men -- of which she has doubtless seen more than enough 
already? 
</P>
<P>
Not many women get jobs as sportswriters, so another story -- also about doors 
that could be closing to working women -- is more ominous. Johnson Controls, 
one of the nation's largest car-battery manufacturers, barred all women 
employees of childbearing age -- not just those who were pregnant -- from jobs 
that would expose them to high levels of lead potentially damaging to a fetus. 
This is the Woman-as-Vessel theory. Women have no value, no lives, no purpose, 
except as breed mares. So, they should be barred from any activity with even a 
remote chance of impairing this. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the jobs in the company were suddenly off-limits to women 
employees. Eight women sued, and the U.S. Supreme Court recently heard 
arguments. If the court backs the company, about 20 million American jobs -- 
most of them well- paid -- could be off-limits to women. Other companies that 
use toxic substances in manufacture have already put "fetal protection" 
policies into effect. 
</P>
<P>
If women can be barred from working with any toxic substance, can they also be 
kept away from jobs in scientific research? Could they be prohibited from 
newspaper copy desks because rays from word processors might affect fertility? 
Construction workers handle solvents and chemicals. Should women be banned from 
that field? Women will be protected out of well-paying jobs -- but no one is 
going to "protect" women from low-paying jobs slinging hash, scrubbing toilets 
or emptying bedpans. 
</P>
<P>
The genes in male sperm can be damaged by toxins. But no one ever talks about 
taking jobs away from men, even though what's toxic for the goose may also be 
toxic for toxic for the gander. 
</P>
<P>
Even as some declare that these vessels must be protected at all costs, others 
are saying the womb is simply a container and not very important at all. A 
California judge recently declared that a surrogate mother who bore a baby for 
a childless couple had no claim on the child. The embryo was the result of a 
union of the donor couple's egg and sperm, implanted into the surrogate mother. 
</P>
<P>
The surrogate argued that while the child was not genetically hers, she had 
carried it for nine months and had formed a mother's bond with the child 
growing inside her. Nope, said the judge, that doesn't count. The ruling 
implied that the experience of birthing the child was of no significance. The 
mother was nothing more than a parking lot for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
When some women are seen primarily as vessels -- either to be protected at all 
costs or used as rental space -- all women are demeaned. In the former case, 
women lose their jobs; in the latter, motherhood itself becomes a job. And if 
you cost it out by the hour, the rate of pay is slightly lower than that at the 
notorious Triangle Shirtwaist factory in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Century, it was accepted medical belief that women should not be 
educated because the brain could not develop at the same time as the ovaries. 
Today, women are still suspect because they don't have the right "math genes" 
or think with the wrong side of the brain or will turn into 
premenstrual-syndrome-crazed witches once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Women in politics are especially up against this myth of female weakness. A 
woman has to prove she is competent to win; a man often has to prove he is 
spectacularly incompetent to lose. Dianne Feinstein added a pro-death-penalty 
stance to her liberal persona to prove she was tough, and many of her ads 
showed her on the job, busily managing. See, a woman can run things. But she 
still lost. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, sexism wasn't subtle at all. Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton 
Williams suggested that rape was something women ought to enjoy, and there was 
talk of "honey hunts" on his ranch during which cowboys chased prostitutes. He 
treated Democrat Ann Richards as if she were a helpless twit, wondering aloud 
when she was going to start drinking again. Only after his behavior showed him 
to be a colossal fool did he begin to slip in the polls. A woman who displayed 
such behavior would have been laughed out of the race early on. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy was running for the gubernatorial 
nomination. She had the misfortune to be photographed in a bathing suit during 
the campaign while vacationing in the Caribbean. The picture was not 
flattering, and the state of her thighs became the subject of much media 
discussion; the anatomy of the male candidates was not subjected to such 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Democrat John Silber created a stir when he suggested that the 
"overweening materialism" of some working mothers could lead to child abuse and 
neglect. It cost him votes among younger women, but many other voters privately 
agreed. Despite years of research consistently showing that children of working 
mothers do not lag behind children of at-home mothers in any area of child 
development, the "neglectful working mom" image is still readily accepted. 
</P>
<P>
For 50 years, researchers have been trying to find the horrible effects of 
maternal employment that have never emerged. And the baby-boomers -- reared 
almost exclusively by at-home mothers -- have more divorces, drug problems and 
unstable career patterns than other generations. But mom at (gasp!) work still 
pushes all the buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Before the industrial revolution, everybody was at home -- and everybody 
worked. It was only after industrialization that the grim reality of factory 
life created the notion of home as a respite from work's cruelties and women as 
the ministering angels of the hearth. Motherhood was turned from a natural 
human function into some strange variety of sainthood. Saints aren't supposed 
to park their halos and go to work. 
</P>
<P>
For women, the message is clear. Just because you can wear green-and-beige 
desert camouflage instead of chador black, it doesn't mean things on the home 
front are just fine. In the parlance of the locker room, never drop your left; 
you could get sucker-punched. Where sex discrimination is concerned, there is 
no such thing as yesterday's news. It keeps turning up in tomorrow's headlines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rashid Khalidi, who teaches history at the University of Chicago, spoke for 
many of his deeply concerned colleagues last Sunday when he shared his fear 
that the United States is proceeding, "half-blind," toward a war in the Persian 
Gulf. His audience of more than 1,500 teachers and specialists was assembled -- 
not far from the Alamo in San Antonio, Tex. -- for the annual meeting of the 
Middle East Studies Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Guild rules require the specialists to grumble frequently about policy-makers 
in Washington who do not seek -- and may even spurn -- their advice. This time, 
the complaints were often coupled with general astonishment that President Bush 
seems to have no one on his top decision-making team who knows very much about 
the Arab world. Citing the potential backlash from the region and the dangers 
involved in upsetting its balance of power, Khalidi roused his audience by 
insisting that the specialists exert themselves to overcome the pro-war 
"idiots' consensus" in the press. 
</P>
<P>
But Khalidi faces a dilemma, one not unlike that bedeviling the President and 
his policy-makers: Despite anxiety about war, the professor believes that 
Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait must be reversed. Which prompted a 
scholar from Kuwait to stand and ask the unavoidable question: How do you 
propose to get Iraq out of Kuwait? 
</P>
<P>
What's needed are military measures that, by spotlighting Iraqi weaknesses, 
force Saddam Hussein to confront the cost of launching an attack on allied 
forces, while simultaneously weakening his grip on Kuwait. The point is to 
design steps that will withhold force as long as Iraq complies, and to make 
compliance an overwhelmingly obvious choice. In contrast to the war option, 
steps of this sort are likely to be widely supported in the international 
community and in the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Creative ideas about the calibrated use of military power against Iraq have 
been offered. For example, the United States and its allies should, at the 
request of the legitimate Kuwait government, protect Kuwaiti airspace from 
Iraqi intruders. Given the availability of highly sophisticated battlefield 
technology like AWACS, the allies could police Kuwaiti airspace with minimal 
exposure of friendly aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, this airspace option illustrates how the logic of the crisis -- 
yield or be attacked -- can usefully be changed to increase pressure on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
For a few exciting weeks in August and September, it was easy to bask in the 
warm glow of a new international order and marvel at the rejuvenation of the 
United Nations. But reality has a way of chilling hopes. It will be six months 
or more before the embargo ordered by the U.N. Security Council really begins 
to cause pain in Iraq, and time can be a fickle ally of such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The President has emphasized that his decision to bolster U.S. forces in the 
gulf by 200,000 soldiers is intended to leave no doubt in Hussein's mind that 
his demand for unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait is deadly serious. 
Unmistakably, the military posture of U.S. forces is rapidly moving toward an 
offensive capability. 
</P>
<P>
But by making the threat of war more credible, the President has dramatically 
stoked the fear of war. Ironically, the new deployment will likely increase 
pressure on Washington to accept a compromise solution rather than push the war 
button. 
</P>
<P>
Time is a crucial dimension in the crisis, but only afterward will it be clear 
whether the U.S. decision to send more troops to the gulf put time to work for 
or against Hussein. The Iraqi leader has apparently calculated, not without 
good reason, that he might outlast the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
By accelerating the clock and assembling what -- by almost any conceivable 
standard -- is a truly remarkable fighting force, the United States has raised 
what soldiers like to call the "pucker factor" for Hussein. But -- and here the 
dilemma thickens for Washington -- these substantive and psychological gains 
are unavoidably offset by a narrowing of options in concert with the allies. 
</P>
<P>
The ad-hoc coalition of forces in the gulf, now numbering more than 300,000, 
may remain intact only as long as it is not called to action. As the United 
States strides boldly to the brink of war -- what would be the first 
Arab-American war -- its allies, for the most part, are content to march in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Though they would apparently be happy if the United States decided to crush 
Iraq, the Egyptian and the Syrian governments know there are limits to what 
their domestic constituencies will tolerate vis-a-vis another Arab state. 
Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez Assad of Syria have emphasized that 
they have not deployed forces in order to invade Iraq or Kuwait, but to defend 
Saudi Arabia. Egypt wants to give the embargo at least two to three months more 
time to work before upping the ante. Even then, it will move into Kuwait only 
as part of a U.N. force. The European allies, with the notable exception of 
Great Britain, remain committed to a diplomatic rather than a military 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is difficult to imagine a diplomatic settlement that would satisfy both 
Baghdad and Washington. Hussein says "Let's talk," but aggressively reiterates 
that Kuwait is an inextricable part of Iraq. If Bush has painted himself into a 
corner by refusing to entertain any outcome short of an unconditional Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait, Hussein, by making peace with Iran and conceding Tehran 
all its war objectives, has done the same thing. If the Iraqi army withdraws 
unconditionally from Kuwait, the Iraqi leader will not only have lost his war 
with Iran but his confrontation with the world as well. He is too shrewd and 
wily to think that he could survive in power after such a double loss. 
</P>
<P>
It is increasingly recognized in Washington that the costs of unilateral action 
are likely to be high, and thus it is essential for the United States to remain 
under the U.N.'s umbrella of legitimacy. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
has emphasized that the gulf crisis is a test of the U.N.'s capacity to cope 
with serious challenges to the international order in the 1990s. But even if 
nine or 10 members of the Security Council could be persuaded to vote in favor 
of a large-scale attack to push Hussein out of Kuwait, the risk is that the 
price of military "victory" may be so high that this experiment in U.N. action 
would become a negative model. For nearly three decades, the 1960 U.N. 
intervention in the Congo crisis inhibited any suggestion that offensive 
military actions should be taken under the U.N. banner. 
</P>
<P>
If the gulf crisis erupts into a maelstrom of combat, the real danger is not 
that the United States or its allies will lose on the battlefield, but that a 
Pyrrhic victory will be won. This is why the war option makes many 
policy-makers uneasy: It opens up too many routes to subsequent disasters. 
</P>
<P>
The logic of geopolitics -- the maintaining of a balance of power between Iran 
and Iraq -- also argues against a massive military assault on Iraq. Any 
sensible military plan for action against Hussein and his army must be 
reconciled with the axiom that a weakened Iraq necessarily produces a 
strengthened Iran. As William G. Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs, notes: "It 
would be a supreme irony if the United States destroyed Iraq, thus permitting 
Iran to re-emerge as the strongest power in the gulf and, in passing, also 
strengthen Syria." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts argue that Iran is currently weakened by internal problems -- 
economic chaos, political disorder and waning popular support -- and that the 
last thing Tehran wants to do is embark on ambitious efforts to extend Iranian 
influences and power. This may all be true. But a power vacuum in the gulf 
would create new realities, sucking in Iran despite its disclaimers. 
</P>
<P>
In its complexities, its dangers, its diverse effects on the world economy and 
its ramifications for the international system, the gulf crisis is without 
historical precedent. But the crisis, and especially its denouement, will 
become a precedent for world politics in the 1990s -- and probably beyond. If 
it all comes down to war, the dead will overwhelmingly be Iraqi -- and 
American. History strongly hints that both sides, in retrospect, will wonder 
whether war really was the only option. In retrospect, it seldom is.

NATIONAL DEBATE ON GULF POLICY WOULD PRODUCE UNITY; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTITUTION: BUSH WRONGLY BELIEVES THAT RECENT HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL 
EXPERIENCE JUSTIFY HIS ACTING WITHOUT A DECLARATION OF WAR FROM CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Dallek, Robert Dallek is a professor of history at UCLA. His newest 
book is When Politics Was King: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960, first 
of two volumes, to be published next year by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not since the Vietnam War has a U.S. President ordered so many American 
soldiers overseas. And President Bush and his secretary of state, James A. 
Baker III, have repeatedly warned that unless Saddam Hussein voluntarily 
withdraws his troops and tanks from Kuwait, the United States may have to use 
military force to dislodge them. 
</P>
<P>
Distracted by arduous budget negotiations and midterm elections, Congress and 
the public followed the Administration's lead in the Persian Gulf with little 
protest. But the President's order to send an additional 200,000 men and women 
to Saudi Arabia, coupled with his increasing impatience with Hussein's 
stubbornness in the face of a U.N. embargo, have suddenly brought the prospects 
of war and all its terrible consequences to the nation's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Pleas for a national debate and direct congressional action on the question of 
war and peace are growing in number and volume. Last week, leaders within the 
President's own party, as well as top Democratic lawmakers, urged him to call a 
special session of Congress to take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The President has resisted these calls. Bush has insisted that he has no 
immediate plans to go to war, that he will give the embargo time to modify 
Iraqi behavior. In any event, the President said he would consult Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But his failure to promise to seek congressional authorization for using force 
suggests that the President, despite warnings that domestic political turmoil 
could erupt over "George Bush's war," shows no signs of shifting the hard 
decision of war and peace to Congress -- where the Constitution says the 
war-making power resides. Indeed, during a meeting with congressional leaders, 
Bush pulled a copy of the Constitution from inside his coat and acknowledged 
that it gave Congress war-making power. But he then pointedly asserted: "It 
also says that I'm commander in chief." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because Bush believes that recent historical and political experience justify 
his acting without a national debate or a congressional declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Like all U.S. Presidents since World War II, Bush operates on the assumption 
that prompt -- and if necessary, secret -- operations overseas by the White 
House are essential to protect U.S. national security in a dangerous world. He 
regards this proposition as an unassailable truth challenged only by the most 
naive. The life of the nation cannot be entrusted to 535 squabbling 
representatives and senators who lack the international perspective of a 
President -- and the depth of foreign-policy experience of this President. Nor, 
the White House believes, should a responsible chief executive leave crucial 
questions of war and peace to a mostly uninformed and emotional public buffeted 
by media reporting. 
</P>
<P>
The history and outcome of the Cold War also recommend political risk-taking 
for the national well-being. True, some administrations have suffered political 
setbacks and, in Lyndon B. Johnson's case, defeat for their boldness abroad. 
But when these losses are set alongside a world throwing aside communist 
governments and command economics in favor of democracy and free enterprise, 
Bush cannot doubt the wisdom of presidential initiative and decision-making in 
the Persian Gulf or, for that matter, on all questions of war and peace. 
Truman's Doctrine, Marshall's Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
intervention to save South Korea and secure Japan, Eisenhower's Doctrine for 
the Middle East, opposition to communism in Guatemala, Nicaragua and Grenada -- 
all are examples of what the Administration believes ultimately made Europe, 
the Middle East, Asia and Central America safer for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The President also sees recent political history in the United States, and his 
role in it, as reasons to assume effective management of a war in the gulf. 
Nearly 60 years of successful media manipulation and spin-doctoring have fed 
politicians' faith in selling their programs, policies or images. In Bush's 
case, anyone who could so effectively sell the public on promises of no new 
taxes in a time of such mammoth deficits must have supreme faith in his ability 
to mobilize support for a war against the likes of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
A national debate, the President's men say, risks undermining his diplomatic 
campaign to punish Hussein's aggression. The Iraqi leader has already depicted 
the United States as a paper tiger, a nation lacking the will to lose 10,000 
soldiers for what it sees as an uncertain cause. He exploited last week's 
congressional calls for a special session as signs of U.S. disunity. Thus, 
debating his gulf policy would play right into Hussein's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Critics warn that such thinking may result in the political fall of the 
Administration in 1992. As evidence, they point to the political consequences 
for Harry S. Truman of acting in Korea without congressional or public sanction 
and for Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan of undertaking secret 
operations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central America, 
respectively. Each suffered political losses at home as a result of their 
imperious adventures abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It is a telling point. In Johnson's case, his extraction of the Gulf of Tonkin 
Resolution from Congress on false grounds and his escalation of the fighting in 
Vietnam by stealth opened up a "credibility gap" and made the conflict more his 
war than America's, with disastrous political results for him. Vice President 
Hubert H. Humphrey anticipated the dangers to their Administration in a letter 
to Johnson in February, 1965, before Johnson plunged into the quagmire: 
</P>
<P>
"American wars have to be politically understandable by the American public. 
There has to be a cogent, convincing case if we are to enjoy sustained public 
support." Without it, Humphrey predicted, "political opposition will steadily 
mount" and there would be "serious and dire effects." 
</P>
<P>
A debate on the President's gulf policy in the Congress and the country would 
serve two ends. It would meet the constitutional requirement that Congress 
"have the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war." 
And it would help show the country why we need to fight. 
</P>
<P>
What is America's vital interest in the region and why do we need a war against 
Iraq to defend it? Only convincing answers to these questions can create a 
consensus for the sacrifices that would follow from military action. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a national debate would not be easy or painless. It would no doubt 
uncomfortably remind us of Winston Churchill's comment that democracy is the 
worst possible system, except for all the rest. But by going to Congress for a 
war declaration, if Bush sees conflict as unavoidable, the President would have 
an opportunity to break the cycle of excessive -- indeed, unconstitutional -- 
control over war-making by the executive branch of government. He could restore 
the tradition that served the country so well before the world wars -- a 
democratic debate by Congress and ordinary citizens on whether the nation is 
best served by military action. Both those debates, however divisive, 
ultimately helped create stable support for painful wartime losses. 
</P>
<P>
A national debate on how best to proceed in the gulf would help clarify 
whether, in fact, we need to resort to military force if Hussein refuses to 
budge. The appearance of division thereby created would comfort Hussein. But 
that would only be temporary, for he would soon learn that such a debate is 
democracy's way of concentrating its mind and might against regimes indifferent 
to the well-being of its citizens and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The modern device of a congressional resolution empowering a President to act 
in response to a foreign crisis has lost its credibility since Johnson used it 
to deceive Congress. Nor is invocation of the War Powers Act a substitute for a 
declaration of war. Both routes allow Congress to circumvent its constitutional 
duty to face up to the question of war. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a national debate, followed by a declaration of war, if necessary, 
would allow the Administration to avoid the political divisions that drain 
national spirit and the will to fight. Perhaps most important, military action 
against Hussein might then truly become an advance for democracy at home and 
abroad.

I guess politics makes strange bedfellows, but then again, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
I was really torn between the two candidates for governor because I couldn't 
figure out who was worse. 
</P>
<P>
But then when Dianne Feinstein reneged on her vow to stop campaigning if Wilson 
returned to Washington and put crib notes on her hand before a debate, my 
decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
And when I saw her "chubby friend" (as Wilson called him, which was really a 
low shot) with her, the old saying "birds of a feather flock together" came to 
mind. After all, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) is a proven liar and cheat. 
</P>
<P>
What we need now is a limit on congressional terms and a line veto for the 
President so these little "pork barrel" items that are tossed into bills, which 
are completely unrelated, could be eliminated. Maybe, just maybe.

<P>
Now that what used to be called voter apathy has been established to be 
frustration at the lack of choices between the major party candidates, it is 
high time that the media begin paying attention to the minor parties. These 
parties actually have divergent political philosophies that may appeal to many 
nonvoters who probably do not even know they exist. 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to rationalize the decision of the media (with the exception of 
some talk radio stations) to perpetuate the myth of the two-party system, I 
imagine that journalists feel these parties are not newsworthy because they 
receive few votes. However, the reverse is also true, as few people will vote 
for parties that they know nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to imply that The Times or other papers should endorse these 
candidates; only that they should acknowledge their existence. Feinstein was 
not, as The Times stated, the first female gubernatorial candidate in 
California, or one of only five female candidates on the ballot. She was the 
first major party female candidate, and one of five major party candidates.

SWEEPING THE STREETS OF CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
IN BRAZIL, DEATH SQUADS RESORT TO THE CAPITAL-PUNISHMENT APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Child abuse the world over is a serious problem, but perhaps this 
adult-perpetrated tragedy is nowhere more severe than in Brazil, where homeless 
street children are subject to unofficial police execution. 
</P>
<P>
In this poverty-drenched nation of 154 million people -- the largest country in 
South America -- many families live on the edge of desperation, and many young 
men, from the age of 5 years on up, take to the streets to scrape out a living. 
The net result is a curbside underclass, estimated to be as large as 7 million, 
that is involved in the struggle of trying to eke out mere existence. 
</P>
<P>
The very size of this class of poverty-stricken children adds enormously to 
crime in Brazil. Shops are often looted at night; street robberies are not 
uncommon; begging is constant. To make matters worse, however, deaths squads of 
police, often hired by local merchants, hunt children out and kill them. The 
Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analysis reports that 457 young 
people -- few with criminal records -- were executed by police last year. 
</P>
<P>
The use of death squads as sadistic street sweepers of children is sickening. 
Brazil abandoned military rule in 1985, and three years later a new 
constitution explicitly guarantees fundamental human rights. As a report by 
Amnesty International put it: "However, passing laws and ratifying 
international instruments are only the first steps toward guaranteeing respect 
for human rights. The Brazilian government must find the political will, and 
dedicate the resources, to translate its constitutional obligations into 
reality. Without this, legislation to protect human rights becomes a dead 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago 70 heads of state convened at the United Nations in New York at 
a World Summit for Children. Sponsored by UNICEF, it concluded with the signing 
of a Declaration of Children's Rights. It was the largest gathering ever of top 
political leaders. It was for a good cause, indeed. "There can be no nobler 
task than giving every child a better future," said the declaration. Brazil is 
not the only violator of children's rights by any means. But it has a terrible 
and immediate problem. The world is watching to see how Brasilia solves it.

GANGS KEEP SHOOTING, PEOPLE KEEP DYING; 
</P>
<P>
A SUMMIT CONFERENCE, USING BLOCK'S PHILOSOPHY, IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a decade of intensive law-enforcement efforts to rein them in, youth 
gangs are continuing to expand at an explosive pace. As many as 100,000 young 
men, and a growing number of women, now pledge their allegiance to a gang in 
Los Angeles. They are much better armed than their predecessors and more 
deadly. As gang violence statistics swell, law-enforcement experts, led by L. 
A. County Sheriff Sherman Block, are not just calling for reinforcements to 
help break the vicious cycle, but for social programs. That's new. 
</P>
<P>
It's also important -- and heartening. "The message to be made clear to average 
citizens is that putting more dollars into law enforcement is not going to 
enhance their safety," Block told Times reporter Louis Sahagun. "We also need 
social programs. They are absolutely essential." Block is absolutely correct. 
</P>
<P>
Cops and deputies are simply outmanned and, increasingly, they know it. They 
need help from all quarters to prevent more youngsters from becoming 
gang-bangers, and to stop the carnage that is paralyzing too many 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
To come up with more answers, the sheriff is calling a conference in January 
that will include law-enforcement representatives, community leaders, 
politicians, religious groups, educators, parents and a host of others who 
refuse to give up in the face of escalating gang violence. That summit, though 
limited to areas of the county patrolled by the Sheriff's Department, is a 
strong and welcome step. It can reduce bureaucratic competition and increase 
cooperation and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
It should be duplicated. There should be a similar summit-type conference for 
the city of Los Angeles, perhaps under the leadership of Los Angeles Police 
Chief Daryl Gates, who says there is little difference between his views on 
gangs and Block's. If so, both Gates and Block should consider co-chairing a 
regional conference on gangs, perhaps later in the year, to which community and 
business as well as law-enforcement leaders could exchange views and map out 
strategies to share. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a greater emphasis on social programs will cost money at a time when 
there are not enough public dollars to finance other critical needs. That 
suggests the need to reassess funding priorities. 
</P>
<P>
There is also help for the asking, however. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Community Youth Gang Services, Brotherhood Crusade, Nation of 
Islam, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and others poured staff and 
volunteers into the L. A. Police Department's South Bureau, once the city's 
most violent. The committed citizens painted over graffiti, set up job programs 
and initiated neighborhood street patrols. 
</P>
<P>
That combination of law enforcement and social intervention, nurtured by South 
Bureau Deputy Chief William Rathburn, paid off. Gang crime dropped by a third. 
It should be duplicated wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the countywide gang-related death toll is expected to 
top 600, an all-time high. Thousands more children and other innocent victims 
will be crippled for life. Stopping the downward spiral won't be easy. But 
Sheriff Block is right to call for more programs to do what cops and jails 
can't do alone.

U.S. AGGRESSION IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up to now I didn't know quite how to say it, but with a little help from our 
President I can now express myself. Don't accuse me of plagiarism; the stuff in 
quotes is from the kinder and gentler George. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it with cruelty" by our Contra mercenaries who "ransacked and 
pillaged a once peaceful and secure country, its population assaulted, 
incinerated and even murdered." 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it with brutality against innocent people" in El Salvador and 
Guatemala and all the people who are being "starved by brutal dictatorships" 
supported by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it and I'm simply trying to have the American people understand how I 
feel about the brutality" of U.S. policies. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that "such an American President would play politics with the lives 
of American kids halfway around the world." 
</P>
<P>
He has taken the initiative to have the United Nations Security Council declare 
Iraq responsible for its occupying Kuwait and to ask nations to prepare claims 
for financial compensation. Then it follows that now is the time for President 
Bush to go into court with clean hands and pay Nicaragua the $12-billion 
judgment levied against the United States by the World Court.

PAYING TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of people are willing to sacrifice their daughters and sons but 
refuse to sacrifice their money? 
</P>
<P>
The only concrete way in which most of us can show our patriotism is to pay our 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the flag and singing "God Bless America" are symbolic ways of showing 
our gratitude for what our country has given us. But we have schools and 
freeways and hospitals to use because someone paid for them -- with taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, many so-called patriotic Americans are contemptuous of men and 
women who object to sacrificing their lives in pursuit of a questionable 
foreign policy. These same "patriots" see nothing inconsistent in voting 
against anyone who suggests that paying taxes is a necessary part of good 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
The only war most "conservative" patriots ever opposed was the "War on 
Poverty." They opposed it because it attempted to take some of their money and 
use it to help other Americans. Apparently, it's OK to send our youth away to 
help defend other governments, but it's not OK to send our money to help our 
own!

Pete Wilson has won the battle, but lost the war. The issue to me was a divided

A Republican in as governor with a Democratic Legislature. Since that has 
happened, Wilson is going to find that many of his campaign promises are going 
to be derailed in the Legislature.

For an example, cock an eye toward Washington. Checks and balances ain't what

<P>
I was pleased with the election results. The Democrats wanted badly to win the 
governorship and defeat Proposition 140. They lost and I'm glad. 
</P>
<P>
I have been disaffected with my party for some time. 
</P>
<P>
I was outraged by the gerrymander it rammed through the Legislature in 1982. I 
thought it was an insult to all voters, especially to people like myself who 
are lifelong Democrats. I expect my party to compete with attractive candidates 
and programs. Winning this way does not impress me. 
</P>
<P>
It annoys me that after each election cycle, my party chooses the same leaders, 
(Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown and (Senate President Pro Tem) David Roberti. 
They, in turn, appoint the same committee chairmen. I would like to see some 
fresh faces. 
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, I am disgusted with my party's approach to politics. It is 
totally Republican. Raise big money and run for public office. With two parties 
like this, what hope is there for representative government?

STILL LISTENING FOR THE FOOTSTEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LIPSYTE, Lipsyte, a former New York Times, CBS and NBC correspondent, 
won an Emmy this year as host of the nightly local PBS show, The Eleventh Hour. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a magical night 25 years ago this month, an ancient boxing shaman told me a 
story without an ending, a fabulous gift that transformed me into the most 
rewarded of genre writers, the novelist for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, I only knew I was in Las Vegas to cover the heavyweight title 
match between Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson, and that this old man, Cus 
D'Amato, who had once managed Floyd, was a reporter's trove of arcana and 
insight. After dinner, we sat by the deserted, neon-splashed swimming pool of 
our casino hotel and Cus reminisced about the night he had waited by the door 
of his old ghetto gym, listening for the footsteps of a "contender." 
</P>
<P>
If a kid came up those dark, narrow, twisting flights of stairs alone and 
running scared, said Cus, there was a chance he might stay with it, hang tough, 
find himself through dedication and sacrifice. Fear, said Cus, was like a fire. 
It can destroy you or it can make you a hero, a contender in the ring and in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
I sat up the rest of that night aflame. To me, at 27, becoming a contender 
meant writing fiction. I had never made it up those stairs because I had 
nothing to say. But now I had questions to answer. What kind of kid would come 
up those dark stairs? What would he be running from? Toward? There was only one 
way to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, when I got back to New York after the fight, there was a letter 
from the Junior Books department of Harper &amp; Row, wondering if I had "ever 
considered writing a novel with the ring as its milieu." 
</P>
<P>
Funny you should ask. I've started already. All I can tell you is that the book 
will have dark, narrow, twisting stairs, and that it will be titled "The 
Contender." 
</P>
<P>
Because the novel was short and linear, sexless (though violent), and the 
protagonist was 17 years old, it was packaged for a newly created market, Young 
Adult, 12-and-up. It was published in 1967 and rode a literary wave. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Ursula Nordstrom and Charlotte Zolotow of Harpers, a dedicated band of 
editors, teachers and librarians created a bridge of words from illustrated 
children's books to a lifetime of reading with the novels of such disparate 
writers as S. E. Hinton ("The Outsiders"), M. E. Kerr ("Dinky Hocker Shoots 
Smack"), Paul Zindel ("The Pigman"), Robert Cormier ("The Chocolate War") and 
Judy Blume ("Forever"). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, literature for adolescents thrived before books were branded YA. 
What is "Huckleberry Finn," "Little Women" and "The Catcher in the Rye"? But 
now there were suddenly textbooks, learned journals, library specialists, 
graduate studies, all supported by publishing departments filling orders for 
designated bookstore and library shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Contender" was a commercial and critical success, the boom went 
on without me. I left sportswriting to write old adult novels and screenplays 
with varying success. But nothing came close to the response I was getting from 
that YA novel, that sense of reaching out and touching lives. White girls from 
Iowa wrote that even though Alfred Brooks was a black boy from Harlem, his 
hopes and fears were theirs. Black boys from Harlem wrote that they read the 
book because they had to, for school, and liked it until the ending. There was 
no ending. What happened to Alfred Brooks? Did he get his friend, James, off 
heroin? Did he finish school? Did he make it as a boxer even though he had no 
killer instinct? 
</P>
<P>
I answered them all, gently suggesting that the next chapter was theirs to 
write. I didn't tell them I considered myself retired, a one-shot YA author, my 
future in rewriting King Lear, not Kid Lear. 
</P>
<P>
And then one magical night 14 years ago, while writing an article for Mother 
Jones on books that had shaped me as a kid, the phrase "in the prison of my 
fat" dropped out of the typewriter. I'd been very fat. How fat? When the number 
200 rolled up on the scale, I bailed out. How did I lose all that fat? Well . . 
. The letters for "One Fat Summer" were surprisingly similar. Younger readers 
make characters their friends. One girl said she understood the fat boy 
perfectly because she was "skinny as a broomstick and six feet tall." 
</P>
<P>
This time, I visited schools and libraries and answered questions. Yes, being 
so fat had made me a reader and a writer; yes, my own children read my books; 
no, I wasn't rich, but meeting them and talking about my characters as if they 
were alive was a thrill beyond royalty statements. But I couldn't answer the 
most frequent question. I didn't know what happened to Alfred Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
I could tell them about Cus, though. A dozen years after our first meeting, he 
heard the footsteps of his contender, an incorrigible 14-year-old who was 
punching apart a reform school near Cus' rural retirement home. One of the 
counselors, a former boxer, asked Cus to help out. Eventually, Cus adopted the 
boy, Mike Tyson. Cus died just before Mike became heavyweight champion of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
By then, I was a television journalist, barely interested in YA, which was now 
firmly established as a lucrative genre for publishers and gifted young 
writers, and a lightning rod for censors. The only time I thought about it was 
when someone I was interviewing, or working with, asked me what happened to 
Alfred Brooks. My generation of readers was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
And then one magical night four years ago, a teen-age Indian boy told me about 
his feelings of being trapped on the reservation, but afraid to leave. He had 
run away once, a triumph of survival, he thought, but he had been returned by 
the police, a humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Would he try again? What was he running from? Toward? There was only one way to 
find out. 
</P>
<P>
The publishing house is called HarperCollins now, and Charlotte Zolotow is 
about to retire, but "The Brave," about a kid boxer, Sonny Bear, half-Indian, 
half-white, who walks into the middle of a Times Square drug war, will be 
published next year under her imprint. 
</P>
<P>
I should be looking for a job right now (my talk show was canceled) or at least 
trying to scare up some deal, but after all these years, I've finally figured 
it out. I, too, want to know what happened to my characters. 
</P>
<P>
Was Sonny Bear's left hook really as good as I thought it was? Does he really 
have a chance to become heavyweight champ? His manager, my first contender, 
Alfred Brooks, who led me up my own dark stairs, thinks Sonny can hang in there 
and go all the way. But for me, there's only one way to find out.

THE KING OF CRIME IN THE SUITES; 
</P>
<P>
TWILIGHT AT MAC'S PLACE BY ROSS THOMAS (MYSTERIOUS PRESS: $19.95; 320 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Ansen, Ansen is film critic for Newsweek. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone reading a Ross Thomas thriller for the first time is in imminent danger 
of addiction: One taste is never enough. His books ought to come with a health 
warning: Prolonged exposure to this page-turning prose can lead to nervousness, 
loss of sleep and antisocial behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, fellow suspense writers and his passionate fans have been singing 
Thomas' praises for more than 20 years, with an ever-rising sense of 
frustration and injustice: How can it be that a writer so blissfully 
entertaining isn't a staple of the best-seller lists? (The question itself has 
become a Ross Thomas cliche.) Each new book -- and this is No. 23 -- is 
expected to be the "breakthrough" that will put him in the magic circle with 
the Elmore Leonards and Robert Ludlums and John Le Carres. Though Thomas is a 
steady seller -- and anybody who's been profiled in People magazine can no 
longer be considered an obscure cult writer -- a stylist who is this deft ought 
to be a household word. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Thomas often is mentioned with Leonard is wildly misleading. 
Leonard works the streets, writing about crime in low places. Thomas writes 
about crime in high places. He's the most worldly of thriller writers, equally 
at home with a Central American dictator, a Washington labor leader, the madam 
of a Shanghai bordello or, in his new book "Twilight at Mac's Place," the inner 
offices at Langley. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas tone -- funny, urbane, politically savvy -- exudes a bouncy 
disenchantment. One of the characters in his new book is described as having a 
look of "semi-devout fatalism . . . acquired only by those who at some risk 
have peered into the human abyss and aren't at all reassured by what they've 
seen." That could go for Thomas as well, but as that quote suggests, not far 
beneath the jolly cynic lurks a disappointed romantic. 
</P>
<P>
Not for nothing did E. J. Dionne, the New York Times reporter, describe Thomas 
as a "Humphrey Bogart liberal." The wonderful, hard-drinking rogues who 
populate his adventures have been around the block too many times to be 
paragons of virtue; they're willing to play as dirty as the really bad guys. 
Yet sooner or later their dormant idealism -- usually expressed by their 
contempt for official cant -- peeks out from behind the protective shell. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' blithe fatalism isn't just literary attitude. What gives it authority 
-- and makes his books so damn much fun to read -- is Thomas' insider's 
familiarity with the corridors of power. Whether he's writing about corruption 
in Southern California ("Chinaman's Chance," arguably his best book), oil and 
arms in Libya ("The Mordida Man"), labor unions ("The Porkchoppers"), African 
tribal politics ("The Seersucker Whipsaw") or that wonderful Shanghai bordello 
("The Fools in Town Are on Our Side"), Thomas gives you the impression that 
he's been behind the closed doors where the deals get made, the palms are 
greased, the cover-ups are arranged. 
</P>
<P>
His characters may have fanciful names like Lucifer Dye and Velveeta Keats and 
Otherguy Overby, and they're certainly smarter and cooler under pressure than 
anybody you or I will ever know, but even his most baroque fabulations have the 
ring of political veracity. Thomas just makes the awful truth hopelessly 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Twilight at Mac's Place," his rousingly adroit new thriller, begins with the 
death of a 57-year-old sometime CIA operative named Steadfast Haynes. His 
companion at the moment of his death, at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, is 
a 33-year-old French reporter, Isabelle Gelinet, who promptly, and subtly, 
blackmails the bureaucrats at Langley into giving her old friend an Army burial 
at Arlington Cemetery. Steady, she informs them, has left behind a copy of his 
memoirs that just might give an honest account of what Haynes "had really done 
as an occasional agency hire in Africa, the Middle East, Central America and 
Southeast Asia." 
</P>
<P>
At Steady's sparsely attended Arlington funeral, we meet an arms-dealing 
ex-French Foreign Legionnaire named Tinker Burns; Isabelle; an aging CIA 
operative named Gilbert Undean, who knew Steady in his Laos days, and the 
novel's true protagonist, Granville Haynes, Steady's 33-year-old son. Granville 
is one of Thomas' larger-than-life, improbably well-rounded men of action. A 
former LAPD homicide detective with a master's degree in Old French from the 
University of Virginia, he has recently won the state lottery, enabling him to 
retire from the force to pursue an acting career. As it turns out, he'll need 
to be both cop and actor to get out of this situation alive. 
</P>
<P>
As the inheritor of Steady's combustible memoirs -- which he is not certain 
actually exist -- Granville finds himself at the center of a bidding war. An 
anonymous figure offers him $100,000 for the book. The CIA, cringing at the 
thought of publication, makes a counter offer. And then the war gets lethal. 
Isabelle, who helped Steady write his memoirs, is found murdered in her 
bathtub. Someone, it seems, has a very literal notion of a kill fee. 
</P>
<P>
No more of the plot should be revealed; suffice it to say that the nastiness is 
just beginning, and the twists come with breathless efficiency. (Amazingly, 
Thomas never outlines his plots -- he makes them up as he goes along.) 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the fun is the appearance of two Thomas regulars, McCorkle and 
Padillo, the heroes of his first, Edgar-winning novel, "The Cold War Swap," as 
well as "Cast a Yellow Shadow" and "The Back-Up Men." Mac's Place, as the 
faithful already know, is their dimly lit Washington bar and restaurant, the 
sort of place, Padillo explains, "you go when you have to meet someone and 
explain why you won't be getting the divorce after all." Mac's Place is to 
Thomas' Washington what Rick's was to Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
This time Padillo and McCorkle, getting on in years, cede center stage to the 
younger Granville and to McCorkle's own 22-year-old daughter Erika, who's 
inherited her father's taste for adventure. McCorkle himself has hit 221 pounds 
and now chews Nicorettes, while the dashing Padillo -- "the assassin's 
assassin," as one of his enemies calls him -- seems to have stolen "the secret 
of eternal middle age -- if not youth itself." The presence of these "old 
dragons," a step or two slower than they used to be, gives Thomas, 63, the 
opportunity to punctuate his suspense tale with witty ruminations on the 
changing times, whether it's the inflationary cost of hiring a hit man or the 
fact that nobody eats his salad after his meals any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Twilight at Mac's Place" takes place in the Washington of the Oliver North 
trials, shortly after the inauguration of the 41st President. "What you've got 
now is the first director of Central Intelligence ever to be President, which 
they don't seem to mention much anymore," remarks Tinker Burns. Mixed in with 
characters with work names like Pabst and Schlitz are sprinkled resonate 
references to Casey, Poindexter, Hakim and North. These are the real toads in 
Thomas' imaginary garden, and their presence seems to inspire him to his 
mordant best. 
</P>
<P>
"Twilight at Mac's Place" is the most stylish and suspenseful of the 
Padillo-McCorkle series, the most densely populated with memorable characters. 
As always, there's not a wasted motion in his fleet, elegant prose. 
</P>
<P>
This book is serious fun. But what Ross Thomas thriller isn't?

THE QUEEN OF DARKNESS; 
</P>
<P>
THE WITCHING HOUR BY ANNE RICE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 965 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rita Mae Brown, Brown's most recent novel is Wish You Were Here (Bantam), 
co-authored by her cat, Sneaky Pie Brown. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Witching Hour" unfolds like a poisonous lotus blossom redolent with 
luxurious evil. Or so it would seem to a Medieval or "born -again" Christian. 
For those Christians and non-Christians not fearful of stories about unearthly 
powers, witches and secular resurrections, this novel will delight the senses. 
</P>
<P>
Author Anne Rice uses her beloved New Orleans to good effect. Of all American 
cities, it is the least Puritan and the most resistant to English priggishness. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Curry, the primary male character and an impoverished native of this 
delicious city, dies and is brought back to life by Rowan Mayfair, a woman of 
science who happens to have magical powers. However, the price of resurrection 
comes very high, and Michael is drawn into an ancient web spun for more than 
three centuries by a dynasty of witches and a demon named Lasher -- souls, 
undead, yet not alive either. They need Michael and Rowan for their purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Rice thoroughly enjoys herself as she slides through 17th-Century France, the 
fetid plantations in Port-au-Prince, the pain of the Civil War South and the 
seeming "normalcy" of today's San Francisco and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The multiple generations of Mayfair women in the house on First Street are 
strange. Generation after generation, since the first Mayfair woman landed on 
American soil after fleeing a slave insurrection in Haiti, these women have had 
incredible power. At least one female per generation, the one who wears the 
Mayfair emerald, has exercised this power in worldly ways and has come to a 
tragic, mournful end. 
</P>
<P>
Rice must be wearing the Mayfair emerald herself, since she writes with 
hypnotic power. In "The Witching Hour," as in her vampire chronicles, she 
attacks the idea that good and evil are polar opposites. Renewal through 
destruction and regeneration through violence drive the plots of Rice's 
"supernatural" novels. This is a concept repellent and alien to Christians, but 
something Hindus always have known. This idea allows Rice to create vampires, 
witches and demons who can be figures that excite our compassion, most 
especially in their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The execution of Comtesse Deborah Mayfair de Montcleve in September, 1689, in 
the town of Montcleve, France, is one such scene. This beauty (the witches 
always are beautiful) is accused by her mother-in-law of sleeping with Satan 
and murdering her husband. The doomed Deborah at least enjoys melancholy 
exaltation as she destroys her accusers by unleashing a storm upon their heads. 
</P>
<P>
It's a scene that satisfies emotionally because the "bad guys" die. In the 
hands of a less-skilled writer that's all this scene would have accomplished, 
but Rice uses it to spur on a witness to this disaster, a former lover of 
Deborah's, one Petyr van Abel. A student of witchcraft, he follows Deborah's 
20-year-old daughter Charlotte (his daughter as it happens) to Port-au-Prince, 
where she flees to escape a charge of witchcraft against herself. 
</P>
<P>
Conveniently, Abel keeps a file on the Mayfair witches, which he sends to his 
comrades in the Talamasca, an order formed in the 14th Century for the study of 
the supernatural and whose members often possessed supernatural powers 
themselves -- white witches, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking up the time sequence of a novel always is a risky device. Using 
epistles to advance the story is another volatile invention, because if the 
reader does not like the first-person voice of the letter the thread is broken. 
To Rice's credit, she makes the epistolary interruption work. The fact that the 
letters are packed with sexual scrimmages (and incest, no less) helps. 
Americans can swallow anything if sex is the lure. 
</P>
<P>
What we're asked to swallow is a fascinating look at our ability to change 
ourselves and those around us: Just how much free will do we really have? And, 
are there intelligent spirits who share the Earth with us? 
</P>
<P>
What we can't explain, we declare irrational or evil. What we can't understand, 
we dismiss. What we can't control, we kill. And when we kill, we assign evil to 
our victims, goodness to ourselves. Our victims can be Jews, homosexuals, 
African-Americans; fill in the blanks. They are in some way seen as bad, as 
devils, as subhuman or superhuman; either extreme is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The Devil in Western thought really represents responsibility. Polarizing human 
behavior into a flat struggle between God and the Devil, good and evil, is an 
elaborate rationalization for our infantilism, for the refusal to take 
responsibility for our actions. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Rice so fascinating is her obsession with this theme and her great 
good sense never to discuss it in terms of nonfiction. It's hard to imagine a 
Protestant writing in her ornate style. Her cherubims and seraphims of lust, 
her incubi of desire, seem as gilded and sensual as baroque cathedrals, 
buildings of exquisite sensuality dedicated to eradicating that same sensuality 
in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
When she brings the story to our century, she uses a frail child, Deirdre 
Mayfair, to confess to Father Mattingly that she sees a tall, dark, handsome 
man. Years later this disturbed woman gives birth to an illegitimate child who 
is packed away to California. This daughter, Rowan, has inherited all the 
unholy power of the Mayfair women, although she knows nothing of Deborah 
Montcleve's death in 1689, the New Orleans coven, the stories about her 
great-grandmother as a voodoo queen, who had a purse of gold wherein each spent 
coin returned to the purse by nightfall. But Rowan suffers premonitions -- or 
are they ancestral memories? When she revives Michael and falls in love with 
him, she is drawn back to her ancestors, back to the sweltering secrets of the 
centuries, of the demon and the witches. 
</P>
<P>
As the novel hurtles toward its conclusion, all of the characters from the 
various epochs begin to interweave. There is even a character named Rita Mae, 
which this reviewer found quite gratifying. Each character, sharply drawn, has 
a card to play, a card that must be thrown at exactly the right time for 
someone to hit the zygotic jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
For that's what this novel is really about: putting flesh around our dreams, 
flesh around our fears. 
</P>
<P>
As Michael Curry, the hero, sits alone re-reading "Great Expectations" or 
writing to make sense of his insane, or unsane, experiences with the witches, 
he calms the reader, a necessary medication for this most uncalming book. 
</P>
<P>
He says near the end: "Life must be founded upon the infinite possibility for 
choice and accident. And if we cannot prove that it is, we must believe that it 
is. We must believe that we can change, that we can control, that we can direct 
our own destinies." 
</P>
<P>
It is questionable whether Curry had a snowball's chance in hell of directing 
his own destiny, but you can. Run right out to the bookstore and buy "The 
Witching Hour." Rice has written her best novel yet. But I warn you: There's 
the Devil to pay.

BROADWAY MALADIES;

<P>
ALL HIS JAZZ; THE LIFE AND DEATH OF BOB FOSSE BY MARTIN GOTTFRIED (BANTAM: 
$24.95; 460 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
INVENTING CHAMPAGNE; THE MUSICAL WORLDS OF LERNER AND LOEWE BY GENE LEES (ST. 
MARTIN'S PRESS: $22.95; 352 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stefan Kanfer, Kanfer's latest book is A Summer World (Farrar, Straus &amp; 
Giroux), a history of the Jews in the Catskill Mountains. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be called the longest street with the shortest memory. No longer. 
Today, just about all Broadway has is its souvenirs. The American musical, one 
of our few native art forms, is shuffling off to extinction. Of the seven 
home-grown productions currently on display, five are revivals of a time that 
will come no more. 
</P>
<P>
And yet until quite recently, the Broadway melody was our unofficial anthem. 
You don't have to go back to the palmy days of the Gershwins, Rogers and Hart, 
Jerome Kern or Cole Porter. After all, it was only three years ago that one of 
the theater's most influential directors suffered a fatal heart attack on a 
Washington street. The 60-year-old had been rehearsing numbers half a block 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fosse went out of show business the way he came in: full of an 
inexhaustible appetite for success and self-annihilation. This is no news to 
anyone who saw "All That Jazz," Fosse's autobiographical film that oscillated 
between hagiography and hatchet job. But as critic Martin Gottfried shows in 
this intelligent anecdotal study, the man was neither as imperial as he claimed 
nor as vile as he felt. 
</P>
<P>
Fosse was brought up in a religious home on the North Side of Chicago. Pop sold 
insurance; Mom saw to it that the five kids got an education. Bob's was in a 
dancing school, and then as part of an act called the Riff Bros. The innocent 
teen-ager hoofed and puffed his way into burlesque. "I was really unhappy and 
scared," Fosse was to recall. "It left certain impressions on me that weren't 
too good. I was too young to be exposed to naked ladies." 
</P>
<P>
Fosse never really outgrew that period. In his work, sex became tinged with 
guilt and voyeurism. In private life, the permanent adolescent, doubtful about 
his masculinity, kept trying to reassure himself with nonstop affairs. They 
persisted through three marriages -- the most enduring to Gwen Verdon -- and 
they continued beyond his early success as a $100-a-week choreographer of 
"Pajama Game," past the time in 1972 when he won a Tony for "Pippin," an 
Academy Award for "Cabaret" and an Emmy for a Liza Minnelli special. By then, 
he was living on Dexamil, and no sexual or professional triumph could last. 
After receiving the triple crown, he told friends that he felt "terrific for 
six days. Then, after seven, I thought, 'It's all false.' They made me feel I 
fooled everybody." 
</P>
<P>
But as "All His Jazz" painfully records, if Fosse fooled anyone it was himself. 
From opening night to final curtain, he kept the con in confidence. His nervous 
energy provided the supercharge in all of his shows, but the theater and its 
audiences were changing before his myopic eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Fosse's last production flopped out of town. The musical he was rehearsing when 
he died was a revival of an old hit, "Sweet Charity." It was an irony he might 
have relished: Broadway's progressive force was looking in the rear-view mirror 
when he crashed. Fosse could have made a movie of it. But not a musical. These 
days, British imports entice the advance sales: "Phantom of the Opera," "Cats," 
"Aspects of Love," "Les Miserables," "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the American theatergoer always has been an Anglophile, something 
that Alan Jay Lerner and Fritz Loewe emphatically demonstrated on March 15, 
1956. That was the night "My Fair Lady" opened at the Mark Hellinger. Recalling 
the epochal moment, Gene Lees writes, "Lerner and Loewe, were now the royalty 
of the theater." That is a fair summary of the collaborators' professional 
status -- and the prose style of "Inventing Champagne": Lees, author of books 
about Oscar Peterson and a number of jazz singers, seems far more comfortable 
with the ambiance of smoky nightclubs than in the autumnal atmosphere of 
Schubert Alley. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his subjects are so complex and contradictory that they might elude a 
gaggle of Pulitzer Prize authors. Loewe was the ur-Viennese composer whose 
forebears included Lehar and Romberg. Lerner was made in America, born to 
wealth, educated at Choate and Harvard, where he was a classmate of John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Loewe was married (and divorced) once, and had one main collaborator. Lerner 
was married eight times, and had eight creative partners. Loewe refused to get 
excited by adverse criticism or bad luck; disdain was his weapon. Lerner was 
born with sand under his skin; any slight, real or imagined, was enough to 
upset him for weeks. Out of these differences arose a creative tension that 
produced "Brigadoon" and the lesser "Love Life" before the team crested with 
"My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
They were never to find that form again. The rich score of "Camelot" brought 
them renewed attention, but the production was in fact a slovenly and hazardous 
affair. In the end, nobody seemed to know what it was trying to say or be. 
Especially Lees. 
</P>
<P>
"The story," Lees informs us, "is about two men who love each other having an 
emotional and continuing physical relationship with the same woman, which after 
a time becomes obvious as a homosexual fantasy." (This interpretation would 
come as a surprise to Lerner and Loewe, to say nothing of Thomas Malory, who 
started the whole thing by writing "La Mort d'Arthur" in the 15th Century.) 
</P>
<P>
Director Moss Hart suffered a heart attack during the production of "Camelot." 
So did Loewe. Lerner avoided the cardiologists. He had bleeding ulcers. "We 
will all be replaced tomorrow by hospital orderlies," Loewe cracked. It was 
truer than he knew. 
</P>
<P>
In better times, the elegance of "Gigi" burnished the reputation of the 
composer and lyricist, but today the movie has a slightly cobwebbed look, as if 
it had been written about another century in another century. Loewe eventually 
retired to his yacht, his gambling and his harem of young women. Asked whether 
he missed the creative process, the composer replied, "I have discovered the 
bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Like Fosse, Lerner persisted in the craft that would destroy him. Addicted to 
amphetamines and recognition, he worked with a series of collaborators on shows 
as varied as "On A Clear Day You Can See Forever" with Burton Lane to the 
catastrophic "Dance a Little Closer" (dubbed "Close a Little Quicker") with 
Charles Strouse. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing came close to the adventures of Liza Dolittle, and one day Lerner awoke 
to find himself irrelevant. His bitter observation seems more valid now than at 
his death at 67 in 1986 (Loewe passed on two years later, as old as the century 
itself.) With certain rare exceptions, Lerner noted, "the music in the theater 
today bears no resemblance to the music that is popular on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Unless things change dramatically -- and melodically -- that line should serve 
as an obituary for the American musical. Then, in death, it can finally recover 
its singularity: Throughout all history, no art form will ever have fallen so 
far so fast.

HOUSES WITHOUT DOORS by Peter Straub (E.P. Dutton: $19.95; 356 pp.). Readers 
familiar with Peter Straub's novels, notably "Ghost Story," "Koko" and 
"Mystery," won't be fooled for a minute by his latest offering: "Houses Without 
Doors," a collection of two novellas and five short stories. 
</P>
<P>
They know full well that with Straub, white may very well turn out to be black, 
today may prove to be yesterday (or tomorrow), and what is could very well be 
maybe. This is an author who can plop a seemingly conventional character down 
in the middle of a seemingly familiar setting and within three pages all hell 
has broken loose: Nobody is conventional and nothing is familiar. Be warned 
that Straub isn't the easiest read in the world and that, at times, he can 
become convoluted and obscure to the point of complete bafflement. Bear with 
him at such moments. Don G. Campbell

THE IVORY TRADE: Music and the Business of Music at the Van Cliburn 
International Piano Competition by Joseph Horowitz (Summit Books: $21.95; 290 
pp.). 
</P>
<P>
Former New York Times music critic Joseph Horowitz could well have titled his 
fascinating new book "The Politics of Music." Horowitz reports on piano 
competitions and critiques performances, but at bottom, "The Ivory Trade" is an 
extended condemnation of the way the classical music world finds and promotes 
promising young pianists: by staging grueling, high-pressure, sports-like 
contests that appear to damage as many careers as they make. The Van Cliburn 
competition was born in 1958, months after Cliburn had won, to enormous 
international acclaim, the first Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow. A 
high-profile American counterpart no doubt seemed a good idea at the time -- 
Horowitz cites the furious cultural race between the United States and the 
U.S.S.R. that began the previous year with Sputnik -- but by the 1970s, the 
quadrennial, Fort Worth-based event had become as much an affair of money, 
social climbing and media stardom as of keyboard talent. Horowitz forcefully 
documents an opinion best expressed by cellist and teacher Gregor Piatigorsky: 
"It cannot be useful to discourage a hundred merely to encourage one." Chris 
Goodrich

PRODUCED AND ABANDONED: The Best Films You've Never Seen, Reviews by the 
National Society of Film Critics, edited by Michael Sragow (Mercury House: 
$9.95, paper; 369 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
The concept is terrific: a book guiding filmophiles to wonderful movies that 
somehow have remained obscure. But don't let the title fool you, for many of 
the movies discussed here are in fact quite well known, and few were actually 
"abandoned" by their producers. Many of the critics contributing reviews to 
this collection are sure to have trouble explaining at their next cocktail 
party how movies like "Diner," "Casualties of War" and "Something Wild" qualify 
as "never seen." But in the end, one has to forgive a book that gives new life 
to classics and near-classics such as "The Stunt Man," "Never Cry Wolf" and 
"Straight Time." And in any case, it's always fun to second-guess the experts . 
. . which is to say I'm at a loss to explain why "Bedazzled" and "Dr. 
Strangelove" failed to make anyone's list. Chris Goodrich

MEXICAN VOICES/AMERICAN DREAMS: An Oral History of the Mexican Immigration to 
the United States by Marilyn P. Davis (Henry Holt: $29.95; 446 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
"Mexican Voices/American Dreams" is a labor of love -- just look at the back 
cover, where author Marilyn Davis is pictured with 17 of her 25 Mexican 
godchildren. Davis acts as witness for a group of people whose stories have for 
the most part gone untold, and they do much to correct the stereotypes about 
Mexican immigrant culture. The accounts of border crossings and coyotes and 
federales are familiar, but it's a pleasure to listen to Luis Perez describe 
his pride in becoming a soccer coach in Colorado, and moving to hear Teresa 
Olmos of Guadalajara express her complete dependence on her husband's 
U.S.-earned income by saying, "I don't know how to do anything except raise 
animals, make tortillas and sweep." Davis' passion is sometimes one-sided -- 
even the coyote she interviews is sweet -- but the roots of her devotion come 
through loud and clear. Family, work and the chance to succeed, in either 
Mexican or U.S. terms, is all that most of the people we meet here ask, and it 
seems churlish to consider denying them so little. Chris Goodrich

NEW STORIES FROM THE SOUTH: The Year's Best, 1990, edited by Shannon Ravenel 
(Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill: $9.95, paper; 229 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
The odd thing about short fiction anthologies that label themselves as being 
"from the South" (never the Midwest, or the Northeast) is that, despite what 
seems like an affectation, the stories, sure enough, do sound Southern. Why? 
Editor Shannon Ravenel admits to confusion, herself: "a strong narrative voice 
. . . deep involvement in place . . . in family bonds and in local tradition." 
Whatever. Happily, all but one or two of the 16 stories making up this 
collection succeed resoundingly in not only sounding Southern, but in casting 
light -- much of it harsh light -- on characters, or circumstances, of great 
intricacy. All in all, editor Ravenel has picked wisely and sensitively in this 
well-rounded study of people in crisis or at crossroads. Don G. Campbell

A CRONY ON THE COURT; 
</P>
<P>
ABE FORTAS BY LAURA KALMAN (YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $29.95; 544 PP., 
ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frank Mankiewicz, Mankiewicz served as press secretary to Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. He is vice chairman of Hill and Knowlton Public Affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When President Lyndon Johnson nominated his close friend and longtime political 
associate Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1968, it 
raised a lot of eyebrows in Washington. Fortas had been on the court since 
1965, where he had generally formed a part of the Warren majority on 
civil-rights and constitutional-liberty issues, but his recognition in the 
corridors of the capital was not as a jurist, but as a crony of the President. 
</P>
<P>
There was no major L.B.J. decision, it was generally agreed, that had not been 
at least discussed -- if not cleared -- with Fortas, whether the presidential 
response to the ghetto riots in Watts, Detroit and Newark, the advisability of 
a bombing pause in Vietnam, or the dispatch of American troops to meet a bogus 
communist threat in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
When Fortas appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation 
hearings, some of the Senators opposed to the nomination wanted to know if this 
practice had continued while Fortas sat on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Fortas denied any contact with the President on a variety of matters, 
statements Prof. Laura Kalman, in this biography of Fortas, flatly calls 
"lies." The pattern of dishonesty, Dr. Kalman says, included denials that 
Fortas ever had recommended a candidate for a judgeship or other public 
position (he was, she says, "among the White House's most fertile sources of 
recruitment advice"). Further, Fortas said he had only had a limited role in 
counseling with respect to the Vietnam war (although perhaps only Secretary of 
Defense Clark Clifford had been more active in advising the President), and 
flatly denied having drafted L.B.J.'s response to the Detroit riots (he had). 
</P>
<P>
This book is what is called an "authorized" biography. Kalman had access to 
family members and documents, the surviving members of his law firms threw open 
their files, and Carolyn Agger, Fortas' widow, spoke often and freely -- as did 
his many friends (and some "confidential" interviewees who were clearly not 
friends). 
</P>
<P>
His friends and family must wish now they had not cooperated. Fortas' 
reputation as L.B.J.'s "fixer," first earned when he supplied the legal 
strategy that enabled Senate candidate Johnson to survive charges of ballot and 
electoral fraud in a Texas primary in 1948, stands up in the book. It was 
Fortas who thought to go to Justice Hugo Black, supervising the Fifth Circuit 
(which included Texas), for an order vacating a state court injunction which 
effectively would have kept L.B.J. off the ballot. It was smart law, and it 
proved successful, and Kalman cites a Fortas (and L.B.J.) detractor who thought 
Fortas must have been to see Black first. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of material in this book to make that ugly charge seem, if not 
true, at least in character. One example should suffice. Fortas, according to 
the author, shared L.B.J.'s hatred of Robert Kennedy. Nothing else would have 
justified his behavior, as set forth here, in the curious case of Fred Black 
and J. Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the Supreme Court -- on which Fortas sat -- declined to review a 
conviction for income-tax evasion of lobbyist Fred Black. Shortly thereafter, 
however, the Solicitor General advised the court that the FBI, in an unrelated 
criminal investigation, had bugged Black's room at the Mayflower Hotel and 
recorded conversations between Black and his attorney. None of the information 
thus obtained, the memorandum said, had been used to convict Black. 
</P>
<P>
The court then threw the FBI a nasty curve: It asked the Justice Department to 
file a memorandum giving legal authority for the microphone surveillance. The 
problem (as with other illegal FBI bugs such as those used to record Martin 
Luther King) was that the required authorization of then Attorney General 
Robert Kennedy had not been obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover, never one to let truth interfere where the reputation of the bureau was 
threatened, tried to get the Department of Justice to say Kennedy knew, or at 
least ought to have known. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach refused. So 
Hoover, anxious to get President Johnson to overrule Katzenbach, went through 
Fortas. He knew his man; Mr. Justice Fortas, according to Hoover's faithful 
deputy Cartha DeLoach, not only agreed to talk to the FBI about the matter -- 
behavior Kalman calls "clearly improper" -- but he agreed to help cook the 
books against Kennedy. He even confided to the FBI that the court had met on 
the Black case and agreed to hear testimony on the bugging. Fortas offered to 
take the FBI "facts" to President Johnson and persuade him to appoint a special 
arbitrator to hear the evidence and report his "verdict" to the court. 
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary revelation -- that a sitting Supreme Court Justice connived 
with a government agency to persuade his friend, the President, to appoint an 
arbitrator who would shield the FBI and damage a political opponent by 
providing the court with false information -- is surely the high point of this 
well-researched and insightful book. 
</P>
<P>
The picture of Fortas that emerges is a strange one. We hear and read of his 
devotion to civil liberties -- sometimes at considerable risk and cost. We read 
of his substantial impact on a whole range of New Deal issues as one of the 
really bright and dedicated young men who came to Washington in the '30s to 
save capitalism and the American Dream through the New Deal. But we also read 
of truly unpleasant behavior, to colleagues and underlings. 
</P>
<P>
Kalman's book is not quite a chronicle of a typical Washington life. There is 
success here, and achievement, and the smell of power. But at nearly every 
stage of his life, Abe Fortas seems to have been, as the British say, "too 
clever by half," and it did him in. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Washington, the driven capital, integrity seems to matter.

WOODSONG by Gary Paulsen (Bradbury Press: $12.95; 137 pp.) A word of warning 
before recommending Gary Paulsen's "Woodsong" for unsupervised reading by young 
people: Parents may wake one Sunday morning to find their 12-year-old planting 
a "For Sale" sign in the front yard and scouring the classified ads for real 
estate in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, "Woodsong" is a book to make a heart of any age race. On the 
surface, it tells the story of how Paulsen, an author noted for his books about 
nature and life out-of-doors for young adults, learned to run sled dogs and 
trained for his first Iditarod race. But there is much more going on here. "I 
understood almost nothing about the woods until it was nearly too late," he 
begins. The tale that follows does not describe in a logical way the steps he 
took to learn dog-sledding -- although there's enough of that here to delight 
the most practical of city slickers -- but rather the series of truths that 
nature and the wisest sled dogs revealed to him. 
</P>
<P>
The gist of the lyrical stories is how little Paulsen knew of himself until he 
let himself be taught; how little he, a woodsman, knew of nature. On one run 
with the dogs, he comes across wolves making a kill. Never having witnessed 
such ferocity, he was horrified (wildlife programs on television always cut 
away before the real savagery begins, he observes). He could not tear his eyes 
away, but when it became too much for him, he yelled. One wolf stood up on his 
hind legs and looked at him over the expanse of snow. At that moment, Paulsen 
writes, "I began to understand that they are not wrong or right -- they just 
are. Wolves don't know they are wolves. That's just a name we have put on them, 
something we have done. I do not know how wolves think of themselves, nor does 
anybody, but I did know and still know that it was wrong to think they should 
be the way I wanted them to be." 
</P>
<P>
The last quarter of the book is devoted to the story of the Iditarod, the 
dog-sled race that runs from Anchorage to Nome, more than 1,100 miles across 
the Alaskan wilderness. Here the reflective stories give way to a one-two-punch 
descriptive style, as the storyteller endures bitter cold, sleep deprivation, 
starvation (one of his dogs refuses all food except the rations Paulsen has 
brought for himself) and the resulting hallucinations. The 17 days of grueling 
travel take an almost physical toll on the reader, who can't help but be right 
there in Paulsen's boots when he finally glimpses the lights of Nome that 
signal the end of the race: "When I realize what they are, I stop the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to go in and finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not understand why, but I do not want to go in. I actually began to walk 
up and take my leader and turn the dogs around and run back, back. . . . There 
is no sense to it but somehow it is because the race is something that doesn't 
seem like it can be done . . . . And yet you do it and then it becomes 
something you don't want to end . . . ever." 
</P>
<P>
The stirring triumph of Paulsen's race combines with the wonder and mystery of 
the earlier stories, and that balance is the sign of a great storyteller: A 
tale that can induce alternately a languorous dreaminess and a fierce desire to 
climb the nearest mountain has done more than its job. 
</P>
<P>
COUSINS by Virginia Hamilton (Philomel Books: $14.95; 110 pp.) "Cousins" starts 
off like one of those "teen problem" books in which a sensitive child wakes up 
to the dangers and anxieties of the world around her. Cammy, Virginia 
Hamilton's heroine, lives entirely in the world of her family: her kind and 
beautiful mother, her changeable but idolized older brother, and her adored 
Gram Tut, who lives in the Care home. On the other hand, there are her teen-age 
cousin Richie, irresponsible and alcoholic; his younger sister, the maddeningly 
perfect Patty Ann (who turns out to be bulemic), and their mother, the hated 
Aunt Effie. 
</P>
<P>
Even before this seemingly predictable story takes its unusual turn, however, 
Hamilton's eye for detail fleshes out the characters and brings hard contours 
to the rural setting where Cammy feels so safe. On her way to summer camp, the 
girl contemplates her town: "Mama says it's no more than a village. If you're a 
town you have to have a jail!" she thinks cheerfully. Through observations such 
as these, Hamilton uses Cammy's innocent perspective to indicate the subtle 
tensions that move the story. 
</P>
<P>
The pivotal chapter in which disaster strikes is almost surrealistic, and 
threatens to lose readers who haven't the patience to wait for subsequent 
dialogue to confirm the tragedy. But Hamilton's ambitious attempt to portray a 
child's grief succeeds completely, and treats with utter seriousness Cammy's 
sense of guilt at having -- to her mind -- brought on her cousin's fate. Sonja

CONTEMPORARY WOMEN WRITERS: Hong Kong &amp; Taiwan, edited by Eva Hung 
(Renditions Paperbacks: $9.50, illustrated). Women writers dominated Chinese 
fiction during the last decade, and these stories bracket the lives of women 
caught in the struggle between Western doctrines of equality and traditional 
Asian female roles. 
</P>
<P>
In "Persimmons," Peng Cao uses a young girl's cruel treatment of her old nurse 
as a metaphor for the cruelty of a society that forces aged women to work or 
starve. "Snow Fields" by Li Li contrasts the feelings of two pregnant women: 
One, compelled by her unfeeling husband to have an abortion, longs to cuddle a 
baby; the other helplessly contemplates the imminent murder of her young 
daughter by her in-laws, which will enable her to bear a boy under China's 
one-child policy. Compelling portraits of lives in transition. Charles Solomon

THE INIMITABLE JEEVES by P.G. Wodehouse (Penguin: $4.95) Typical pandemonium 
reigns when that regular chappie, unsuccessful arbiter of fashion and 
upper-class twit, Bertie Wooster, and his unflappably competent valet, Jeeves, 
are called to assist the scatterbrained Bingo Little in his pursuit of several 
delightfully improbable ladies, including Honoria Glossop and Charlotte Corday 
Rowbotham. Jeeves naturally saves the day, sorting out the myriad complications 
with his singular mixture of unfailing good sense, knowledge of human nature 
and inside information. "The Inimitable Jeeves" is one of four volumes of 
Wodehouse's popular comedy of manners that have been dramatized for 
"Masterpiece Theatre" on PBS. Charles Solomon

APHORISMS by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, translated by R. J. Holingdale 
(Penguin: $7.95) This anthology contains more than 1,000 aphorisms the German 
philosopher jotted in a series of notebooks between 1769 and his death in 1799. 
Goethe, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche all praised Lichtenberg's work, but it's 
difficult to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these odd bits of prose read more like incomplete thoughts ("Never 
before had a mind come to a more majestic halt.") or commonplaces than maxims 
("However did men arrive at the concept of freedom? It was a great idea."). The 
reader looks in vain for the insight of Montaigne, the devastating clarity of 
La Rochefoucauld or the thought-provoking paradoxes of Wilde. These aphorisms 
may have lost something in the translation, but their general shallowness 
suggests that they lost it in the original. Charles Solomon

LIVING ARCTIC: Hunters of the Canadian North by Hugh Brody (University of 
Washington Press: $14.95, illustrated). Brody's thoughtful essays on the 
history, culture and languages of the Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples of Canada 
contrast the let's-rub-noses stereotypes with the true nature of these caring, 
anti-authoritarian cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The respectful relationship that the Inuit maintained with their seemingly 
hostile environment ensured the survival of the people and the animals that 
supplied their food. (Recent studies have shown that their exclusive diet of 
meat and fat supplied all the nutrients necessary for human health: Diabetes 
and other metabolic diseases were unknown among the Inuit until "Southerners" 
introduced them to flour, sugar and alcohol.) The concluding discussion of 
politics documents the growing movement among the Native Peoples to preserve 
their traditional values, despite the increasing commercial exploitation of the 
Arctic and its mineral resources. Charles Solomon

About the picture of the Pony Express stamp (see photo) in the Book Review of 
Oct. 21: 
</P>
<P>
As a ranch-born horseman, I am dismayed that our government would commission an 
artist with so little knowledge of the modus operandi of a running horse to 
design this stamp. 
</P>
<P>
The horse portrayed on the stamp is running rapidly with its hind legs (note 
position of the tail), while trotting sedately with the forelegs! I have 
concluded that the picture constitutes a photographic oxymoron.

REAGAN-BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeing that Richard Reeves (!) was reviewing Ronald Reagan's "An American 
Life," I knew he'd insert his own personal hatred for Reagan. And I wasn't 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In a most biased, bigoted review, he pictures Reagan as an ambitious, 
aggressive politician who "joyfully threw the poor into the streets" (!) and 
enriched the rich. This is utter rubbish, and libelous to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was propelled into politics by other forces, and is far from being a 
callous brute. He worked his way up from poverty, which I bet Reeves never did. 
This review is like asking that other liberal, Ted Kennedy, to review the life 
of William F. Buckley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is now writing the biography of J.F.K. Wanna bet he writes glowingly 
about this shallow, inept, adulterous President?

WORLD WAR II: STRICTLY BY THE NUMBERS;

<P>
BRUTE FORCE; ALLIED STRATEGY AND TACTICS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR BY JOHN ELLIS

<P>
By Duncan Spencer, Spencer is a Washington writer currently at work on a 
biography of World War II paratroop leader Gen. James M. Gavin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Ellis figuratively stuck his nose into the sweaty boots of soldiers in his 
best known World War II book, "The Sharp End of War," to describe the life of 
ordinary soldiers from 1939 to 1945. Now the British historian has written the 
large end, the sums, as it were, of the combatants in mankind's worst war. 
</P>
<P>
"Brute Force" applies new quantitative scholarship to World War II, but it is 
written so skillfully that the reader greets voluminous footnotes with 
pleasure, not the usual guilty dread. This thick book is a mental feast for 
those who have long sought a key to understanding how and why the war unfolded 
as it did. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is not impressed by heroics, or reputations, or specific battles, or most 
of the men and deeds that have made World War II a subject of hundreds of 
books. In fact, his usual tack is to debunk the reputations (Montgomery, 
Patton, Harris, MacArthur all suffer) and deflate the heroes. He is impressed 
by numbers -- of divisions, of ships, of trucks, of guns, of tons of iron ore 
and coal. 
</P>
<P>
It is by poring over these bills of lading, these yellowing papers showing the 
order of battle, the simplest, barest building blocks of history, that he 
reaches his remarkable conclusions. The war, he says, was not won by courage or 
tactics or strategy, but by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
By the numbers, Ellis concludes that it was not the American soldiers or their 
allies who beat the Germans, but the Russians. By the numbers, he concludes 
that the United States, in spite of its important military contribution to the 
war in Europe and the Pacific, was far more important as a producer of machines 
and supplies; and even so, the American wealth of material allowed this country 
to waste time, lives and billions in ineptitude and duplication. Brute force, 
the title, alludes not only to the method the United States fell into for 
waging war but also to the dismissive English put-down: "brute force and 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
He is merciless in his treatment of American management of the Pacific war, 
pointing out that a naval blockade would have accomplished the same thing as 
the land and sea battles and the atom bomb. 
</P>
<P>
He turns familiar events on their ear with his statistics. Under his numerical 
analysis, for instance, the Russian Army did not defeat the German legions. 
Instead, he proves that the Germans destroyed themselves by pouring men and 
metal at an endless supply of Russian targets until the Germans simply had 
nothing left. Ellis proves that the Russians were able to provide more targets 
than the Germans had bullets -- and that decided the contest. 
</P>
<P>
To use another stunning example, Ellis proves by his method that the real 
achievement of the carpet bombing of Germany was not the destruction of the 
famous "bottlenecks" of the Nazi war machine, nor the destruction of German 
urban life. (Other historians, including Albert Speer, already have made this 
point.) The real achievement was to lure out German pilots with enough targets 
to the point that the Luftwaffe simply wasted itself trying to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is not content with this conclusion. When he analyzes the Allies' 
"strategic bombing" program, his cool appraisal is that it was not what it 
seemed, and it also was completely wrong-headed. The most vulnerable targets in 
Germany, he argues, were not plants that produced oil for the well known ball 
bearings, but something far simpler, far more exposed, far more fragile, far 
easier to hit: electricity production and distribution, the common element to 
all industrial production. Yet the leaders of the bombing effort did not 
understand this in 1942 or later. 
</P>
<P>
This book will be controversial because it is a thorough put-down of the United 
States. We have been accustomed to our heroes -- Patton, Eisenhower, Marshall, 
MacArthur, Admiral King and others. We are prouder of World War II than of any 
other war, I venture, because we did not hesitate to help Britain when she 
fought on alone in Europe, and we did not hesitate to fight a war on two fronts 
when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. We were great and we were good. 
</P>
<P>
But we were not great and good in just the way we thought. "It could well be 
argued, indeed," writes Ellis in a typical measured, symphonic paragraph, "that 
the most significant figures in the tables just cited are the 2,400,000 
military trucks produced in the United States as against only 346,000 in 
Germany. Goering's taunt about (American) 'cars and refrigerators' becomes yet 
more fatuous, completely underestimating as it does not only the phenomenal 
productive potential of the American econonomy but also the central role of the 
internal-combustion engine in modern warfare. Many battlefields have been cited 
as being particularly significant in Germany's defeat in the Second World War. 
Not the least of them should be Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
The humble trucks, you see, have a story to tell. In North Africa, in Russia, 
in the long German retreat from Normandy to Berlin from June 1944 to April 
1945, it was the trucks, or the lack of them -- not "the intrepid exploits of 
few gung-ho tank commanders" -- that won and lost the war. It was the trucks 
that were tasked with carrying the gasoline, the ammunition, the food -- 
without which the thin-stretched Germans, in particular, could not operate. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 432,659 American trucks went to Russia under Lend-Lease 
arrangements, and it is to Russia that Ellis returns again and again to drive 
home his most important point -- his convincing argument that Russian blood and 
American steel were the heaviest weights in the balance of victory. Of American 
steel, most people in this country know a good deal, and the fact that the 
entire industrial base was turned to production of munitions is still well 
remembered here. But the appalling sacrifice -- not heroic exactly; call it 
benumbed or heedless -- of Russia's soldiers is less known. 
</P>
<P>
On the eastern front, according to Ellis' well documented calculations, between 
1941 and the end of the war the Germans lost 2,300,000 men. The Russian total 
is generally accepted to be about 13,500,000. The Russians attacked throughout 
without counting the cost. On occasion, they simply marched across minefields 
to close with their foe because their commanders' estimated losses would be 
about equivalent to those they would suffer if the Germans were using artillery 
instead of mines. Comments Ellis: "There can be no doubt that it was Russian 
arms and Russian blood, the pitiless, ceaseless hemorrhage of a whole people . 
. . Perhaps even if Russia had been knocked out of the war, the Americans would 
still eventually have invaded Europe. But in that case they would have come up 
against 150 more divisions they had to fight and one million extra German 
soldiers they had to kill." 
</P>
<P>
All books about World War II circle about the extraordinary enemy, Germany. 
Ellis' fascinating work is no exception, yet he is as confounded as the rest. 
His research shows only that after 1941 there was no possible way for them to 
win -- and it shows too that the Germans knew this all along. Yet they kept on, 
with their extraordinary skill in battle, their intelligent use of slender 
resources, their fierceness and discipline, their wicked strength. 
</P>
<P>
This is the dark question that always lures us to their World War II story.

A NUCLEAR DRAMA IS BREWING; 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSITION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN STORAGE TANKS AT HANFORD, WASH., WORRIES 
U.S. OFFICIALS. THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER IS BEING ASSESSED -- BUT TOO SLOWLY, 
SOME FEAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Just before dawn one day last month, in a million-gallon caldron encased in 
reinforced concrete and buried six feet underground, a vile brew of radioactive 
waste heaved and gurgled, and then -- right on schedule -- emitted a huge burp 
of hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that scientists do not understand, this unnerving drama has been 
recurring every 80 to 109 days for the past 10 years. From seething sludge at 
the bottom of Waste Tank 101-SY at the sprawling Hanford U.S. nuclear weapons 
production site here, hydrogen gas rises and accumulates until the pressure 
breaks through -- or around -- a thick crust floating on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what malevolent chemical reactions are churning in the bottom of the 
gigantic vessel experts do not know, but it is no mystery that a spark in the 
concentrated hydrogen-and-nitrous-oxide gas could start a fire and set off a 
chain reaction that would rupture the tank's dome and spew out radiation -- 
with potentially dreadful consequences. 
</P>
<P>
After having been kept top secret for 13 years, Waste Tank 101-SY's disturbing 
case of indigestion has become the No. 1 priority for government and industry 
waste managers who are baby-sitting 228 huge tanks of high-level radioactive 
waste produced during the more than 40 years that the government has produced 
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Duffy, the Energy Department official now in charge of the massive weapons 
facility cleanup, estimates that emptying the Hanford tanks and permanently 
disposing of their contents may eventually cost $25 billion, and possibly as 
much as $200 billion if the problem continues into the next century, as now is 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
For now, understanding and stabilizing Waste Tank 101-SY is the immediate goal. 
</P>
<P>
"A spark could really set it off," said Ronald Gerton, director of the waste 
management division at the Energy Department's Richland operations office. 
"There hasn't been a spark so far, and we have been lucky. Well, the Challenger 
shuttle was lucky, too, for a number of flights, and then it got unlucky. We 
have to get this taken care of before we get unlucky." 
</P>
<P>
But the house-sized 101-SY is hardly the only underground vessel here that 
needs special attention. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two other such tanks at Hanford have similar, though much less dramatic, 
symptoms of hydrogen accumulation. And yet another 22 are laden with chemical 
compounds that could cause an explosion powerful enough to blow them open if 
they become overheated by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also believe that another 66 of 149 single-shell tanks that were in 
vogue at Hanford before the appearance of double-walled vessels in 1980 may 
have sprung leaks under the punishment of heat and corrosion, allowing upwards 
of 750,000 gallons of the dangerous mixture to drain into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
All are legacy of a time when the premium on plutonium and tritium production 
for nuclear warheads dwarfed considerations of long-term safety and protection 
of the environment. To save time and energy, officials of the old Atomic Energy 
Commission ordered high-level waste -- treated with water and lye -- stored in 
single-shell carbon steel tanks at Hanford. All that came in spite of stern 
warnings from safety experts as early as 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the prospect of massive leakage problems, officials at Hanford 
and a Savannah River, S.C., tritium production site eventually turned to 
double-shelled tanks, with two walls of carbon steel surrounded by reinforced 
concrete. Hanford has 28 of them, including Waste Tank 101-SY, and Savannah 
River has 51. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 34 million gallons of waste in the South Carolina tanks contain 
more than 75% of the total curies of radiation that still are in temporary 
storage from the decades of U.S. bomb-production, Hanford's problems are far 
more daunting. Over the years, the complex here in southeastern Washington 
employed three different chemical processes for stripping plutonium from the 
fuel rods of its production reactors, each creating its own characteristic 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
The stuff deposited by different generations has become mixed. Material from 
leaky old tanks has been transferred into modern double-shelled containers, and 
over the years, some vessels have been "mined" to recover uranium for 
recycling. They have had strontium and cesium chemically stripped out by the 
lye or ferrocyanide; and to reduce waste volume and the danger of leakage, they 
have been heated and dried. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists have a good idea of what has been put into the various 
tanks, they have little confidence that they understand the chemical reactions 
taking place after the mixing and treatment over the years. "The whole 
operation has been destabilized since about 1954," said Robert Alvarez, an 
investigator for the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which has kept a 
close eye on the tanks over the past year. "They have been flirting with a 
dangerous situation since that time." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates for the cleanup of the Hanford site, including the decommissioning of 
its eight plutonium production reactors, run as high as $57 billion. Projected 
costs for cleaning up the entire weapons complex go to $91 billion over a 
30-year period and $200 billion for a 60-year period -- not to mention as much 
as $52 billion worth of modernization over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Waste experts once believed that the mayonnaise-thick sludge in the bottom of 
the temperamental tank 101-SY formed one huge bubble that rose through the 
liquid to be trapped beneath the crust that was floating on top. For six years, 
they tried to relieve the pressure by periodically "lancing" the crust with a 
jet of water or steam or a burst of air, or by dropping a weight through it. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the practice fail to produce results, scientists since have found 
evidence that the air and steam injections may actually have made the episodes 
worse, and that the operation itself risked causing a disastrous spark. 
</P>
<P>
The experts' latest judgment is that the possibility of an instantaneous 
explosion is so far-fetched that it defies credibility. What does cause them 
acute concern, however, is the possibility that a fire might be set off in the 
crust. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that it has organic materials that would provide fuel, and so the 
stuff might burn like black powder," Gerton said. "That could generate enough 
energy and heat to cause the dome to fail and open the tank to the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
To understand the reactions that are generating the hydrogen, scientists need 
top-to-bottom samples that would enable them to construct a chemical model of 
the tank's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The burp in October vented the gas sufficiently that officials hoped to have 
several weeks in which to work with remote-controlled equipment to retrieve 
samples. But by last week, they had given up hope for now of getting beyond the 
crust because the possibility of creating a spark had not been eliminated 
beyond doubt. While they may be able to get material from the crust before the 
pressure buildup makes it prudent to suspend work, they will have to wait until 
a later burp before trying to get critical core samples yielding the needed 
cross section of the crust and the salt-cake-and-sludge bottom. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no drill operation in the tank, Duffy said, until tests 
demonstrate that there is no possibility of igniting the crust. While the 
restless behavior of Waste Tank 101-SY compels immediate attention, at least 22 
older tanks that have been doctored with 160 tons of ferrocyanide between 1954 
and 1957 pose a special explosive potential of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department stresses that the temperature in these tanks is now some 
300 degrees below the level that is considered explosive -- and still is 
dropping. And while officials conceded three years ago that if an explosion did 
occur, it could be powerful enough to breach filters and release a radioactive 
aerosol into the atmosphere, they maintain that beyond Hanford's boundary, the 
additional exposure would be comparable to natural radiation levels. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the department's official estimates of potential magnitude -- contained 
in a 1987 environmental impact statement -- have been seriously challenged. A 
study by the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory, kept secret for five years 
before it was made public by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last 
year, concluded that a ferrocyanide explosion could be equivalent to 36 tons of 
TNT. The disclosure prompted several investigations. 
</P>
<P>
A just-completed analysis by the General Accounting Office, the congressional 
watchdog agency, found that such an accident would blow a large hole in the 
tank top and the earth overhead, releasing a cloud containing highly 
radioactive cesium-137 and strontium-90. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an explosion would be a major accident," the GAO said in a report to the 
House Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural 
resources. The document warned gravely of the possible "contamination of large 
areas within and possibly beyond the Hanford site boundaries, in addition to 
human health effects." 
</P>
<P>
While the GAO report did not dispute the Energy Department's contention that 
the chance of an explosion is slim, it said that work performed by the 
Westinghouse Hanford Co. and Pacific Northwest Laboratory "indicates that, 
although the probability of an explosion may in fact be low, not enough is 
known about the waste in the single-shell tanks to rule out the possibility of 
a spontaneous explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Washington State University Prof. George W. Hinman, who served as a consultant 
to the GAO study, calculated that an explosion in one of the tanks might 
produce off-site radiation exposures 100 times those that the Energy Department 
estimated in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hinman assumed that greater amounts of cesium and strontium would be 
dispersed in an explosion, he calculated that off-site exposure to airborne 
radiation could theoretically be as high as 7.3 rem. The National Research 
Council predicts that prolonged exposure at that level would produce one 
additional case of cancer for every 160 persons exposed. 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc Energy Department task force -- the last in a succession of panels 
reviewing the tanks in recent months -- took issue with the radiation dose 
estimates, though it agreed with broad aspects of the GAO's findings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has announced that the department 
will now proceed to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement on 
the entire Hanford tank situation. 
</P>
<P>
The intense new assessment, he said, is not an indication that federal 
officials have changed their opinion that a significant radiation release from 
any of the tanks is only a remote possibility. Instead, he characterized the 
new review as a step "to assure the people of Washington and Oregon that the 
Department of Energy is committed to an open and frank analysis and discussion 
of the problems presented by the radioactive and hazardous wastes currently 
stored in the Hanford Site's tanks." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is less mystery about the ferrocyanide-treated tanks and the 
rest of the old single-shelled vessels than there is about the bizarre 101-SY, 
officials urgently want extensive core-samples from them as well. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that temperatures in the ferrocyanide tanks are no more than 
135 degrees -- well below the estimated 445-degree level that scientists 
believe is necessary for a chemical reaction to begin. But the readings are 
taken along only one vertical line from the surface to the bottom of the 
</P>
<P>
sludge -- leaving open the possibility that dangerous "hot spots" could exist 
undetected across the 75-foot diameter of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
While the salts in the old tanks are saturated with moisture, the waste in most 
of them is no longer liquid in the conventional sense. Nearly 100 of them have 
already been "stabilized" by evaporating the liquid, which was low in radiation 
and pumped out, leaving salt cake and sludge -- and a much-reduced danger of 
leaks. Under an agreement among the Energy Department, the Environmental 
Protection Agency and Washington state, the rest of the single-shell vessels 
must be stabilized by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
To complete the assessment, the department's first five-year cleanup plan calls 
for acquisition of at least two core samples from each of the single-shell 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the timetable calls for completion of the sampling and analysis by 
the autumn of 1998, but last month the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, 
created by Congress as a watchdog over the massive cleanup program, advised 
Watkins that will not be soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the energy secretary, board Chairman John T. Conway said the 
department's responses to a series of recommendations on the tanks were "not 
adequately responsive" in several respects and the sampling needed to be 
"greatly accelerated." 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed schedule whereby analysis of two core samples from each single 
shell tank is to be completed by September, 1998, is seriously inadequate in 
light of the uncertainties as to safety of these tanks," Conway said. 
"Furthermore, additional samples are required at several radii and at a range 
of elevations for the tanks containing ferrocyanide. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The schedule for the program on study of the chemical properties and explosive 
behavior of the waste in these tanks is indefinite and does not reflect the 
urgent need for a comprehensive and definitive assessment of the probability of 
a violent chemical reaction." 
</P>
<P>
The formal schedule notwithstanding, Duffy said the Energy Department expects 
to have a solid idea by 1992 precisely what is in the tanks. About 45 of them, 
including those with the heaviest loads of ferrocyanide, have already been 
"sampled" with "non-intrusive" techniques such as sonic and infrared inspection 
and gamma spectroscopy. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next six months, officials hope to complete tests to demonstrate 
that it is safe to take actual samples from the bottoms of the tanks containing 
ferrocyanide. Once the tanks can be sampled, the big question will be whether 
GAO consultant Hinman was correct in his belief that cesium and strontium are 
so concentrated that an explosion could produce a radiation hazard beyond the 
bounds of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
If Hinman is right, Hanford faces the staggering new problem of how to 
neutralize that threat. But if the Energy Department's own estimates prove 
correct, the government can begin planning to empty all of the old single-shell 
tanks at last -- either by using robots to remove the dry salt cake and sludge, 
or by reliquefying the material so it can be pumped out and melted with glass. 
</P>
<P>
As Hanford awaited the October burp of Waste Tank 101-SY, authorities at 
Savannah River, S.C., started a series of electric pumps and sent water pulsing 
through a new billion-dollar complex that is supposed to make dangerous waste 
tanks a bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of an 18-month "cold" test, preparing for the day when a 
stream of intensely radioactive broth will be piped into a 1,000-degree melter 
along with a talcum-fine silicate to create deep-brown, obsidian-like logs of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Once these "hot" operations begin, the Defense Waste Processing Facility is 
expected to make glass night and day for about 15 years. Unless there is an 
emergency, it will shut down only two or three times -- whenever it becomes 
necessary to install a new melter. 
</P>
<P>
Sealed in heavy stainless steel canisters, the 10-foot-long, 2-foot-diameter 
glass logs will be individually stored in a honeycomb of concrete underground. 
There they will remain until the government has a geological repository -- 
which it hopes to locate deep in Nevada's Yucca Mountain -- ready for permanent 
disposal of its most radioactive bomb wastes, as well as spent fuel from 
commercial power reactors. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the vitrification process, the 30 million gallons of liquid 
in Savannah River's 51 tanks will be chemically stripped of their most virulent 
isotopes and piped away to be mixed into concrete and poured into heavy 
bunkers. The remaining 4 million gallons of sludge-turned-into-glass will be 
reduced to 7,000 canisters that will still crackle with radioactivity even 
after a thousand years. 
</P>
<P>
Building on its experience in South Carolina, the Energy Department will soon 
be ready to break ground for a similar installation to glassify the sludge and 
salt cake from the bottom of Hanford's 28 double-shelled tanks, and -- one day, 
perhaps -- the troublesome stuff in the old single-wall tanks as well. 
</P>
<P>
The vitrification operation will be accompanied by a new generation of its own 
hazards. Byproducts from glassification of the Savannah River waste, for 
example, will include 50 to 70 tons of radiation-contaminated mercury and as 
much as 100,000 gallons of benzene, which must then be incinerated. 
</P>
<P>
Although France, Germany and the Soviet Union have turned to vitrification as 
their prime means of stabilizing high-level waste, skeptics are concerned that 
the complexity of the material in the Hanford and Savannah River tanks will 
introduce unexpected problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The claim that this is a tried and true technology is not true where this 
country is concerned," Robert Alvarez, the Senate investigator, said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with the future of the long-delayed geological repository still 
uncertain, the logs of radioactive glass could wind up at Hanford and Savannah 
River indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
And considering DOE's past difficulties in putting low-level waste into cement 
-- thousands of barrels of radioactive concrete failed to solidify at Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory -- there is still room to question the strategy for 
disposing of tank liquids. 
</P>
<P>
Says Peter Johnson, waste expert at the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment: 
</P>
<P>
"Standing on the evaporator tower at Hanford, you can look off in one direction 
and see the tank farms that have caused all the trouble, and in the other 
direction, you can see the concrete bunkers that are supposed to be part of the 
solution, and it appears that they are still only moving from one set of 
containers to another."

ABILITY TO FORECAST QUAKES SHAKY AT BEST, EXPERTS SAY;

SEISMOLOGY: MOST SCIENTISTS DISMISS A WIDELY REPORTED PREDICTION OF A MAJOR

"Only fools, charlatans and liars predict earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
That unkind assessment of those who claim to know when the Earth is most likely 
to shudder has been attributed to the legendary pioneer in seismology, Charles 
Richter. The quote has become part of the folklore of the dark art of 
predicting earthquakes, and many would say it is as true today as when it was 
allegedly muttered by the Caltech scientist who gave the world its earthquake 
magnitude scale. 
</P>
<P>
For despite decades of research and enormous progress in understanding the 
mechanics of earthquakes, experts agree that no one has come up with a formula 
that is likely to lead to a reliable prediction of exactly when and where an 
earthquake is about to strike. Even Caltech's Clarence Allen, the dean of 
Southern California seismologists and an eternal optimist in the field of 
earthquake predictions, admitted recently that science is still a long way from 
being able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm going to live long enough to see any kind of routine 
short-term predictions," said Allen, 66. Then, yielding to the optimism that 
has marked his long career, he added: "But I hope in my lifetime I will see 
some intriguing signals." 
</P>
<P>
That, right now, is about the most that any reputable scientist is hoping for, 
despite highly publicized claims by some who say they have successfully 
predicted earthquakes. And that includes a climatologist who has predicted a 
catastrophic earthquake in early December for the New Madrid fault that runs 
through southeastern Missouri, using a theory that has been examined and 
discarded by numerous experts. 
</P>
<P>
Most seismology experts are instead focusing on two expected earthquakes, one 
in Japan south of Tokyo and one in Central California east of Paso Robles, and 
either of those quakes would provide clues that will enhance the chance of 
predicting earthquakes elsewhere. Both projects are based on the belief that 
some earthquakes strike on fairly regular intervals. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists in Japan are not certain they will detect evidence that their 
quake is imminent in the hours before it hits, despite a high degree of 
instrumentation throughout the region. And the Central California quake is 
already past due. 
</P>
<P>
So for now, scientists believe that the best they can do is issue "forecasts" 
of the probability of a specific fault rupturing within a given number of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that increased understanding of seismology has led to a greater 
awareness of the complexity of earthquakes and a keen sense that no two 
earthquakes are exactly alike. Thus what "triggers" one earthquake may not 
trigger another, and events leading up to one quake may be absent from the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
That has left scientists with a grab bag of clues but no formula that will tell 
them which events, such as smaller temblors, will precede a major quake. This 
has made seismologists a humble group, and many are more than a little outraged 
by the New Mexico climatologist's claims that a catastrophic earthquake will 
strike the nation's heartland on Dec. 2 or 3. 
</P>
<P>
Iben Browning based his claim on an alignment of the Earth, sun and moon, and 
his forecast sent shock waves throughout much of the nation -- from Chicago to 
New Orleans -- even though a special panel of experts set up by the U.S. 
government concluded "there is absolutely no scientific basis" for Browning's 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
And although the federal government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
on earthquake research, it has issued only one official prediction of an 
earthquake, and that temblor is now past due. Based largely on an average 
period of 22 years between quakes on a Central California segment of the San 
Andreas Fault, the U.S. Geological Survey predicted in 1985 that an earthquake 
of about 6 magnitude would strike near the community of Parkfield around 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The government has spent $15 million setting up instruments to record every 
event leading up to this quake, and at least 50 experts have devoted chunks of 
their careers to preparing for the temblor. But Parkfield continues to doze. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction said the quake could come within five years on either side of 
that date, so it is not yet invalid, but many scientists are beginning to 
wonder whether nature has played a cruel trick on them. 
</P>
<P>
And new evidence is not encouraging, according to Evelyn Roeloffs of the U.S. 
Geological Survey, who is chief scientist on the Parkfield experiment. Recent 
work suggests that past earthquakes in that area differed considerably from 
each other, and those quakes may not have hit with the regularity experts had 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
So Parkfield, once thought to be the safest of adventures into earthquake 
predicting, is demonstrating just how difficult the field can be. 
</P>
<P>
The real world of earthquake forecasting, it turns out, bears little similarity 
to a recent television movie in which some experts became convinced that the 
Big One was about to strike Los Angeles because conditions here were so similar 
to events leading up to a catastrophic quake near Mexico City in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the Big One could come with no warning whatsoever. All the money in 
the world and the best experiments that scientists can create may fail to warn 
the people of Southern California that disaster is just hours away. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there might be ample clues so that even the dullest of 
seismologists will figure out something is about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
History teaches that lesson quite clearly. In 1975, clues were so persuasive 
that China evacuated the city of Haicheng in the hours before a 7.3 quake, 
which leveled the city. Residents throughout the region had been alarmed by 
frequent foreshocks that rumbled through the region even as residents were 
being evacuated, as well as by peculiar animal behavior for weeks before the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the evacuation, there were few deaths. But only a year later a 
7.6 quake destroyed the city of Tangshan, China. About a quarter of a million 
people died. There had been no warning signs. There had been no prediction. 
Earthquakes are like that. 
</P>
<P>
The humbling nature of seismology left many experts chuckling to themselves 
when they first heard that an obscure climatologist had predicted a major quake 
on the New Madrid fault system, which ruptured in the early 1800s with a series 
of quakes that rank among the most powerful ever to strike North America. But 
some Midwestern officials took it seriously, vowing to close schools and other 
facilities for the days of "geological danger" cited by Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Browning publishes the Browning Newsletter, which is sold to industrial 
customers and has warned of everything from the probability that the U.S. 
government will be overthrown next year to the imminent beginning of an ice age 
just as most scientists are worrying about global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Browning's prediction of a New Madrid quake snowballed in credibility when some 
of his subscribers claimed that he had successfully predicted such things as 
the Loma Prieta earthquake that devastated the San Francisco Bay Area last year 
and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with growing public alarm, the U.S. Geological Survey established an "ad 
hoc working group" to evaluate Browning's prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"We took it seriously and looked at it carefully, even though we were very 
skeptical (of the prediction)," said Thomas Heaton, a scientist in charge of 
the Geological Survey's Southern California office and a member of the working 
group. But after examining the evidence, the prediction "just didn't make any 
sense to us," Heaton said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, the group issued a report challenging virtually every aspect of 
Browning's prediction, including the claim that he had predicted the Loma 
Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, who is recovering from an operation, has declined all interviews. A 
woman who answered the phone at his home said simply that the 72-year-old 
business consultant would stand on his record, despite a strong attack from the 
seismological community. 
</P>
<P>
But did Browning really predict the catastrophes he claims to have foreseen? 
</P>
<P>
The working group reviewed a videotape and a transcript of two speeches 
Browning gave before the Loma Prieta quake, in which he claims to have made the 
prediction. But according to the report, Browning never mentioned California 
and said only that "there will probably be several earthquakes around the 
world, Richter 6-plus, and there may be a volcano or two." 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that his track record in predicting volcanoes is even less 
impressive. He did predict Mt. St. Helens, the report says, during a speech in 
Portland, Ore., six days before the eruption. But by then the area around the 
volcano had already been evacuated, and geologists had issued numerous warnings 
"that a major eruption was imminent," the report said. Browning's predictions 
are particularly frustrating to experts because they are based on a phenomenon 
that has been extensively researched and discarded as the "triggering" 
mechanism for earthquakes. He believes major quakes are triggered by the 
alignment of the Earth and the sun and the moon -- in other words, when there 
is either a full moon or a new moon. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, many scientists thought the same thing because during such a period 
the stress on the Earth is particularly high. The ground bulges and contracts, 
just as the seas swell in tidal actions, so it seemed reasonable that such 
immense stresses could cause earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Heaton himself once thought that might be true, and his early work 
has been cited by Browning to support his prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote a paper I would just as soon forget," Heaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton later repudiated his own work after conducting more extensive research. 
When he looked at earthquakes on a global scale, Heaton found that 79 out of 80 
quakes did not fit the pattern because they did not occur at times of maximum 
tidal stress. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have 79 out of 80 occurring randomly, there's not much predictive value 
in a full or new moon," Heaton said. 
</P>
<P>
The working group's report expressed puzzlement over why Browning zeroed in on 
early December. Even if tides do play a role, Heaton said, there is no reason 
to believe quakes should occur at one particular peak tide. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the tidal conditions in early December will not be significantly 
different than they were as recently as three years ago, and no earthquake 
struck then. 
</P>
<P>
Tidal stresses on Jan. 17, 1988, were only a little less than they will be on 
Dec. 2 and 3, and the difference is so slight that even subtle changes in 
atmospheric pressures would make the stresses indistinguishable for the two 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
So the report concludes that the danger on Dec. 2 and 3 will be no greater -- 
and no less -- than on any other day. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, despite the condemnation of Browning's method, no seismologist 
can say there won't be an earthquake because no one knows exactly when one is 
going to strike. And strike it will, someday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he will say if a major earthquake hits the Midwest in early 
December, Heaton winced. With his face nearly contorting in agony, he said, "I 
guess we will just say, 'damn.' " 
</P>
<P>
If it does hit, even though Iben Browning's method could still be as flawed as 
the experts think, the world would never forget a cantankerous climatologist 
who caused a lot of folks in the Midwest to schedule their vacation trips for 
early December.

ACTIVISTS REACT TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LOSSES 
</P>

<P>
Civil rights activists were celebrating some triumphs of their past at a 
gathering here last weekend when an intense Jesse Jackson strode to the podium 
at Spelman College chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The future, he argued, is imperiled by what he calls "the shaking white hand 
theory -- a weak, scrawny, shaking white hand" that has a job taken away by "a 
strong black hand." 
</P>
<P>
The image derives from a television ad showing white hands crumpling a job 
rejection letter because a workplace "quota" dictated that the job must go to a 
minority. The ad, part of North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms' reelection campaign, 
is credited by many analysts with mobilizing white voters and guaranteeing 
Helms' victory over black Democrat Harvey Gantt. 
</P>
<P>
The ad vividly depicts a new political reality of "blacks as scapegoats," 
Jackson said. That reality was evident in the strong showing by ex-Ku Klux Klan 
leader David Duke in Louisiana's U.S. Senate race, and more important, in 
President Bush's veto of the 1990 Civil Rights bill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the civil rights leaders, Jackson's address was a call to regroup and rearm 
after a long period of retrenchment following the gains of the 1960s. At stake 
is one of the most significant results of the bloody civil rights struggle: 
affirmative action programs designed to overcome discrimination against hiring 
and promoting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to fight back," Jackson shouted, and the audience of about a 
thousand roared and clapped in a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on affirmative action "is galvanizing and creating the greatest 
coming together that we've seen in a long time in the civil rights community," 
said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). The civil rights battle is "very simple" again, 
he said. "We know what we're fighting against." 
</P>
<P>
But the reason their adversary is so apparent underscores the magnitude of the 
struggle facing the civil rights activists. From the Congress to courthouses, 
from polling booths to personnel offices, affirmative action has been dealt 
setback after setback. And now hard economic times, which make each job more 
precious, threaten to strip more white support from the programs that give 
minorities a competitive boost. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the legal attack on affirmative action has been nationwide: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The U.S. Justice Department filed suit in federal court in Baltimore, 
charging that the state of Maryland discriminated against white men and 
violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by setting aside four high-level jobs for 
women and minorities at the state lottery agency. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an award of $186,000 to a 
white social worker who sued because the Pueblo, Colo., school district 
reinstated black and Latino colleagues who had less seniority than she did at 
the time they all were laid off from work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A jury in Pima County, Ariz., awarded $215,000 in damages to a white 
part-time worker who alleged that she was denied a full-time job with the city 
of Tucson because of her race. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four white-owned construction firms in South Florida sued in an effort to 
halt a county minority business enterprise program, alleging that the program 
discriminates against white people because it gives preference to firms owned 
by minorities or women as subcontractors on public projects. 
</P>
<P>
The suits are based on a series of recent Supreme Court decisions rolling back 
provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which authorized federal courts to 
order employers to take action to overcome the effects of past discrimination. 
That action could include quotas -- requirements that, for example, one 
minority member be hired for every white worker brought in. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered large federal contractors to 
demonstrate progress toward diversifying their work forces. Although mandatory 
quotas were not part of Johnson's executive order, they became prima facie 
proof that a contractor was taking steps to comply with the act. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Supreme Court set a narrow limit on the time a plaintiff has to 
challenge discriminatory seniority policies, while at the same time opening the 
door to challenges of settlements years after they have been made. Most 
important, the court put the burden of proof on people charging discrimination 
-- instead of on employers. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions clearly put affirmative action proponents on the defensive, a 
position they were already in politically because of the tie-in to quotas. 
While polls showed that two-thirds of whites still favored affirmative action 
programs, they were absolutely opposed to quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"They think quotas are unfair and un-American," said Los Angeles Times 
political analyst William Schneider. "It means you can work as hard as you want 
and be as qualified and talented as you may be, but you're not going to get the 
prize in the end because it's reserved for somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, any portrayal of affirmative action programs as "quotas" resonates with 
voters. Helms ran against quotas and won reelection to a fourth term with 53% 
of the vote. Calling for an end to affirmative action programs, Duke won 44% of 
the overall Louisiana vote, and he drew a majority of the white vote. 
</P>
<P>
Bush used the "Q" word in vetoing the Civil Rights Act of 1990, even though the 
act did not specifically call for quotas. "I deeply regret having to take this 
action," Bush declared in his veto message. "But when our efforts, however 
well-intentioned, result in quotas, equal opportunity is not advanced but 
thwarted." A veto override attempt failed by one vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was designed to overturn some of the recent Supreme Court 
rulings. It would have required an employer whose hiring and promotion 
standards excluded women and minorities to prove that the standards "bear a 
significant relationship to successful performance of the job." The bill would 
have allowed victims of sexual, religious and national origin discrimination to 
seek compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination. Victims 
of racial discrimination already are authorized to seek such damages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the bill would have given complaining employees as long as two years to 
challenge discriminatory changes in seniority plans, expanding the time from 
the current 300 days. And, it would have prohibited public or private employers 
from engaging in racial discrimination in any aspect of employment, not just 
making of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Such provisions could force an employer to adopt quotas, Bush contended. 
</P>
<P>
As white people challenge affirmative action, black people find it more 
difficult to challenge discriminatory practices, according to a report by 
People for the American Way. It said the series of Supreme Court decisions last 
year "has already derailed more than 100 employment discrimination cases." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the report cites the case of a black man in Birmingham, Ala., 
who worked at an equipment company. During a lunch hour, the company owner 
allegedly put a sandwich on the floor and used an epithet to demean him. Also, 
said the report, the owner, on at least two occasions, allegedly kicked the 
black man "for work-related errors." 
</P>
<P>
The employee was demoted, and he sued. District court found the employer guilty 
of discrimination and awarded the man $150,000 in damages. However, because a 
Supreme Court decision has narrowed job discrimination law to only guard 
against discrimination in the "making of contracts," the decision was 
overturned on appeal. Blatant harassment "is now legal under the Supreme 
Court's interpretation of civil rights law," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
These days, employers "never know who's going to be waiting around the corner 
to challenge a case," said Elliot Mincberg, legal director for People for the 
American Way. He said the climate has "caused a lot of instability that could 
be avoided if Congress corrects the problem next year." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 
says his organization will be doing everything it can to persuade Congress to 
make the change. 
</P>
<P>
The umbrella organization for 
</P>
<P>
185 rights groups lobbied heavily for the vetoed legislation and will do so 
again, said Neas, declaring that the 50 million people represented by the 
groups "want to make sure that the Helmses and the Dukes of the world don't 
prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Gandy, secretary-treasurer of the National Organization for Women, said in 
order to counteract the quota scare, the legislation's proponents "have to find 
some direct and less legalistic way of explaining the fairness and rightness of 
what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is strong evidence of continued difficulty for minorities in 
getting jobs and promotions, civil rights advocates contend. 
</P>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said that during fiscal year 1990, 
which ended in September, 89,295 job discrimination charges were filed with the 
agency. Of those, 47,394 were racial, and 33,092 were gender-based. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Labor Department, black executives in all civilian jobs 
were 5.7% of the total of 14.8 million in 1989, barely up from the 5.3% in 
1985. During the same period, Latino managers increased from 3.5% to 4.0%. 
Women fared better, rising from 35.6% to 39.8%. All of these percentages fall 
well below each group's representation in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Even companies with the best reputations for affirmative action reflect the 
long, slow climb that minorities and women face making their way up the 
corporate ladder. 
</P>
<P>
At the Monsanto Co., where minorities make up 15% of the 29,000-person work 
force in U.S. operations, they are 11% of the management ranks. Women, 27% of 
the giant chemical manufacturer's U.S. work force, are 22% of the managers. 
</P>
<P>
"By no means are we where we want to be," said Edward Williams, Monsanto's 
director of equal opportunity affairs, "but we're moving in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph Hale of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, which has 13,500 member 
firms, said that because of tighter labor markets, employers increasingly "are 
going to have to turn to a diverse kind of work force," but that "effective 
affirmative action in the '90s is going to be education and training, not 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Ethridge, president of the American Assn. for Affirmative Action, 
said "somebody is going to have to be kind of the traffic cop to regulate what 
goes on in terms of not only hiring but promotions. That is where affirmative 
action programs can play a very significant role." 
</P>
<P>
"It (affirmative action) is much more a management issue than an enforcement 
issue," said Jan Ellis, director of public affairs at the Labor Department's 
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, adding that the department is 
"taking the lead on what we call the 'glass ceiling initiative,' which is not 
only to look at where women and minorities have entered through the door, but 
where they are in the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activists just want the laws to mean what they meant before the 
Supreme Court rulings made job discrimination cases more difficult to win. 
That, they say, is an essential tool for preventing minorities and women from 
losing ground and for righting past wrongs. They vow to make passage of a new 
civil rights act a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, I believe in the triumph of justice," said Joseph Lowery, 
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, vowing to use the 
ballot box, street marches and economic boycotts, if necessary, to fight for 
new legislation.

BUSH WARNS OF MIDEAST PERIL IN PRAGUE SPEECH 
</P>

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaving behind a nation deeply divided over the prospect of war in the Persian 
Gulf, President Bush arrived here Saturday looking for a receptive audience for 
his message that "the freedom of people everywhere remains under threat" from 
the aggression of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, Bush noted, was among the first victims of Nazi aggression in 
the 1930s and of Soviet aggression a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bush told a huge crowd in the city's Wenceslas Square, "it is no 
coincidence" that Czechs and Slovaks "should be among the first to understand 
that there is right and there is wrong. There is good and there is evil. And 
there are sacrifices worth making." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's speech to more than 100,000 flag-waving people in the vast square -- the 
largest such audience of his presidency -- kicked off a weeklong trip through 
Europe and the Middle East during which words delivered to overseas audiences 
will be aimed largely at home. 
</P>
<P>
For the President and his advisers, the scenes of foreign applause provide a 
welcome opportunity to rebuild domestic support for their Persian Gulf 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to do so, Bush hewed strictly to his argument that the main 
justification for his policy is the need to stop aggression, avoiding the 
economic argument advanced recently by Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
and stressed privately by many Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The current crisis is a warning to America as well as to Europe that we cannot 
turn inward, somehow insulate ourselves from global challenges," Bush told 
members of the Czechoslovak Parliament a few hours before his speech in the 
square. "Iraq's brutal aggression against Kuwait is a rude reminder that none 
of us can remain secure when aggression remains unchecked." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit here came on the anniversary of the precipitating incident of 
Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution, the police attack on student 
demonstrators in Prague on Nov. 17, 1989, that eventually led to the downfall 
of the Communist government. His speech was set on the site of some of the 
revolution's largest demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
But in contrast with the open-air speeches by Czech and Slovak leaders that 
punctuated those demonstrations, Bush spoke from inside a glass-and-plywood 
booth set up in the square, largely blocking the view of the statue of St. 
Wenceslas on horseback that symbolizes Czech nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
The enclosure, resembling a huge fish tank, was one of several unusually tight 
security precautions adopted to meet the threat of Iraqi-inspired terrorism. 
They served as symbols of how much a trip originally designed to celebrate the 
end of the Cold War in Europe has been overshadowed by the prospect of a hot 
war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bush's visit, the first to the country by a U.S. president, drew 
an emotional response from the crowd. As he completed his speech, Bush rang a 
replica of the Liberty Bell, then briefly joined in the chorus as the massive 
crowd swayed to the tune of "We Shall Overcome," the U.S. civil rights anthem 
adopted as a hymn of Czechoslovakia's so-called Velvet Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
As darkness fell over the square, parents held children up on their shoulders 
in the hope of giving the youngsters a glimpse of the President, First Lady 
Barbara Bush and Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel and his wife, Olga, 
standing inside their protective booth. During the singing of the national 
anthems and the laying of wreaths to commemorate Czechs and Slovaks killed 
resisting communism, tears ran down the cheeks of some onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
For most of its brief existence as a nation, Czechoslovakia has been tied to 
the United States. Czechoslovakia's first president, Thomas Masaryk, an admirer 
of Thomas Jefferson and other leaders of the American Revolution, won the 
country's independence at the end of World War I largely by persuading 
then-President Woodrow Wilson to support his efforts during the postwar 
Versailles Peace Conference. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Prague's main railroad station, which bore Wilson's name until the 
Nazis took over the country in 1938, was rechristened with the former 
President's name.

<P>
And speaking to the crowd at the square Saturday, Havel invoked the American 
experience to assure his people that the country can prevail over its current 
deep economic and political problems -- including the threat of secession by 
the Slovak regions in the nation's east. 
</P>
<P>
After its own revolution, Havel said, "the United States overcame the initial 
spell of crisis and developed into a powerful citadel of democracy . . . a 
source of inspiration and hope for all those who suffer oppression." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no other path for us to follow but the path of the same effort," 
Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush praised Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution, declaring that 
"the world will never forget what happened here in this square where the 
history of freedom was written. 
</P>
<P>
"In the face of force, you deployed the power of principle. Against a wall of 
lies, you advanced the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In throwing off communism, Bush said, Czechoslovakia had joined "a new 
commonwealth of freedom" based on principles of the dignity and rights of man, 
the conviction that government derives its powers from the people, that people 
have the right to enjoy the fruits of their own labors and that the rule of law 
must govern nations. 
</P>
<P>
As the nation moves from revolution to renaissance, Bush said, "we will not 
fail you in this decisive moment. America will stand with you to the end." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also announced that the Declaration of Independence of the first 
Czechoslovak Republic, issued by Masaryk in Washington in 1918 and stored ever 
since at the Library of Congress, will be returned to Czechoslovak custody. 
</P>
<P>
The speech on the square was the emotional highlight of a day that began with 
Havel greeting Bush in a chill, windblown ceremony outside the city's ancient 
Hradcany Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with leaders of the Czechoslovak federal government as well as leaders 
of the Czech and Slovak states, trying in his meetings as well as his speeches 
to follow Havel's policy of mollifying Slovak nationalism by singling out 
Slovak figures for praise. 
</P>
<P>
The conversations, Administration officials said, concentrated on economic 
issues. Czechoslovakia, which will soon take the difficult plunge into a truly 
free-market economy, has been seeking expanded aid and trade from western 
nations. Bush pledged to be "supportive," but made clear that increased aid 
from the U.S. government will be scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that would be of most benefit to Czechoslovakia and the United 
States would be increased investment and increased private sector help," he 
said at a brief news conference with Havel. 
</P>
<P>
And then, bringing the discussion back to the subject that is clearly uppermost 
in his mind, Bush noted how much the confrontation in the Persian Gulf has hurt 
Eastern Europe by raising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"My little visit . . . convinced me that it's everybody that's being hurt by 
this aggression," he said. 
</P>

MANY POOR WOMEN STILL FORGO PRENATAL CARE; 
</P>
<P>
OBSTETRICS: BENEFITS HAVE IMPROVED. BUT IGNORANCE AND SHAME, AMONG OTHER 
FACTORS, DETER PATIENTS. BABIES PAY THE PRICE.

<P>
Despite improvements in Medi-Cal benefits and improved services at satellite 
health clinics in Ventura County, many low-income women are still getting 
inadequate prenatal care, doctors and other health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,882 babies born last year at Ventura County Medical Center, where most 
of the county's low-income women deliver, 40.7% did not receive prenatal care 
in the first trimester, according to hospital records. More than 10% of the 
mothers were not examined by a doctor until the third trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Kasting, director of the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, 
estimates that as many as a quarter of the infants in the unit -- most of whom 
were born prematurely -- would be healthy if their mothers had received 
adequate treatment during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that infant mortality climbs significantly when women have 
no prenatal care," Kasting said. The 20-bed neonatal unit is nearly always 
full, and will expand to 30 beds next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's infant mortality rate was 6.6 in 1988, the most recent year for 
which figures are available. That means that for every 1,000 babies born, 6.6 
did not survive to age 1. 
</P>
<P>
The county's rate is below the statewide average of 8.6 and is lower than 30 of 
the 38 urban counties ranked by the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ventura County rate was significantly higher -- 7.4 deaths per 1,000 
births -- among Latinos, who make up most of the clientele in the county 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos also have a higher percentage of babies weighing less than 5 1/2 
pounds, a key predictor of mortality and disability. Among Latinos, 5% of the 
4,014 babies born in 1988 weighed less than 5 1/2 pounds; of the 10,167 Anglo 
babies, 4.7% had low birth weights. 
</P>
<P>
"Most middle-class women miss a period and see a doctor," said Dr. Robert 
Lefkowitz, the county hospital's director of gynecology and obstetrics. 
"There's a certain amount of education and sophistication" about the importance 
of prenatal examinations and tests. 
</P>
<P>
But ignorance is only one of many reasons that low-income women often fail to 
get prenatal care, officials say. Language and cultural differences, lack of 
transportation, frustration with bureaucracy, embarrassment about being a 
single mother and long waits to see a doctor also discourage women from getting 
care early in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually within our culture, women take care of themselves last," said Petra 
Luna, associate director of health education for Clinicas del Camino Real, 
which operates three clinics serving the Latino communities in Oxnard, Saticoy 
and Fillmore. "As long as they feel fine, they think there's no need to go." 
</P>
<P>
Many low-income couples think they cannot afford prenatal care, at least in the 
early stages of pregnancy. But a 1987 change in state law made it much easier 
for low-income women, even illegal aliens, to qualify for Medi-Cal obstetric 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Some women are taking advantage of the change -- 660 were receiving Medi-Cal 
obstetric benefits in Ventura County last month, compared to 259 in July, 1989. 
But many more don't know they qualify, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know it's easy to qualify for Medi-Cal," Lefkowitz said. "There 
are very few who wouldn't qualify." 
</P>
<P>
Low-income mothers also qualify for the federal Women, Infants and Children 
program, which provides food for pregnant and nursing mothers. But Antonia 
Lopez, who helps mothers sign up for the program at the county hospital's 
women's clinic, said many women are not aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
Socorro Torres, a patient at the county's satellite clinic in west Ventura, 
said she delayed getting prenatal care because she still owed the clinic money 
from a previous operation and didn't know that Medi-Cal might cover her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Now in her fourth month, she had her first visit with a doctor on Friday. Her 
physician, Dr. Brian Prestwich, said it is difficult at this stage to predict 
Torres' delivery date, which may become significant if she eventually needs a 
Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, 29, said her husband abandoned her when he learned she was pregnant. 
She works at a Ventura glass company and is raising her 6-year-old daughter by 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
She said most of her friends know the importance of prenatal care but think 
they cannot afford it. She said one friend, an illegal alien, did not realize 
that she qualified for Medi-Cal pregnancy benefits. The friend did not get 
prenatal care, Torres said, and delivered a baby with facial deformities. 
</P>
<P>
Lefkowitz and other physicians said prenatal exams can detect kidney disease, 
diabetes and hypertension, which complicates fetal growth and can provoke 
premature delivery. Mothers also are counseled about nutrition, smoking, 
drinking and drugs. Sonograms and other tests can detect problems early that 
otherwise might threaten pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Early prenatal care should keep Romie Pina and her unborn child healthy. She 
has come to the Ventura clinic every month since learning she was pregnant. 
After she told Prestwich about occasional bleeding, he found that her placenta 
was turned around and was bumping against the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
Now Pina, 26, must stay off her feet as much as possible and avoid strenuous 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"She really has to take it easy," Prestwich said. "The placenta could break and 
cause life-threatening bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
If she had not seen the doctor early, Pina said, she probably would have 
continued her job as a janitor, which often involved heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"He has helped me a lot to understand the problem. I was in a panic," said 
Pina, who had been told at age 20 that she could not conceive and is eager to 
have the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Another patient at the clinic, Elida Mendoza of Santa Paula, was diagnosed with 
a pregnancy-related condition that causes her immune system to destroy blood 
platelets, the cells that cause clotting. She must avoid bruises and cuts, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza, 21, said she learned about prenatal care in her sex-education and 
home-economics classes at Santa Paula High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's important for the baby to be healthy. I want to know that 
everything is all right," said Mendoza, who has been coming to the clinic since 
the first month of her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her acquaintances know the importance of prenatal care and are aware of 
the programs that provide it, Mendoza said. "A lot of girls don't go because 
they are embarrassed. They live with their parents and want to keep it quiet as 
long as possible. Sometimes they want to put off facing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of help available," she said. "I don't think that's the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Lefkowitz agreed. "If everyone asked for prenatal care, we'd have difficulty 
providing it. But at this point it's not a problem of availability. There is 
some wait to get in, but there are many who just aren't calling for care." 
</P>
<P>
Prestwich said the county's mission is "not only making care available, but 
getting people to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
The county's satellite clinics in Ventura, Santa Paula, Moorpark, Simi Valley, 
the Colonia neighborhood of Oxnard and South Oxnard encourage people to use the 
system for prenatal care and other treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the clinics provide continuity, which is unavailable at the 
county medical center's clinic, where a woman is likely to see a different 
doctor each visit. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics also make prenatal care more accessible to people with 
transportation, child-care and financial problems. Every Wednesday, for 
example, a Medi-Cal worker visits the west Ventura clinic to answer questions 
and help patients with paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
Jonette Duchai, associate administrator of the county's Health Care Agency who 
is in charge of the clinics, said the county has placed more emphasis on the 
clinics in recent years. The result has been a steady increase in patients, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, physicians will be added at the Santa Paula and south Oxnard 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
Prestwich said the clinics' outreach is crucial to providing effective prenatal 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get a mom in here and develop a relationship with her, I have a much 
better chance of keeping her . . . out of pre-term labor," said Prestwich of 
the west Ventura clinic. "Patients are much more likely to call when they 
develop a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have an attitude that 'here we are, come and get us' instead of reaching 
out, we'll fail, there's no question," Prestwich said.

SCHOOL SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Smollar's report that significantly more money is spent in San Diego 
schools attended by students from low-income families than on schools serving 
more affluent students is no news to me. Despite their extra income, the former 
schools still lag in student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence that there is little relationship between school spending and 
school achievement is widespread. I recently obtained a statistical coefficient 
of correlation between U.S. Department of Education figures on high school 
graduation rates and the amount of money spent per student by the 50 states. It 
suggests that there is absolutely no relationship between the amount spent on 
students and their school achievement across the country. 
</P>
<P>
This fact generally is either ignored or perversely contradicted by the media. 
For example, Times writer Louis Sahagun's report on juvenile gangs ("Fight 
Against Gangs Turns to Social solution," Part A, Nov. 11) contends that this 
problem is the result of "schools that are substandard and overcrowded." 
</P>
<P>
It may be journalistically chic to pass on this misleading assumption, but this 
attitude helps not at all in our need to deal with the true causes of student 
underachievement.

SAN DIEGO DOESN'T DESERVE SUPER BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
RACE RELATIONS: PAST SNUBS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. HAVE MADE AMERICA'S FINEST 
CITY MORALLY INELIGIBLE TO TAKE THE SPORTING EVENT AWAY FROM ARIZONA.

<P>
Less than two weeks ago, the best way to define the Yiddish word chutzpah was 
to tell the story about the child who did away with his parents, then appealed 
for leniency because he was an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
But on Nov. 7, the kid was outdone by San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, San 
Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos and the entire San Diego Super Bowl Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
When the National Football League moved to shift the 1993 Super Bowl out of 
Phoenix after Arizona voters rejected a referendum establishing a state holiday 
on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, San Diego leaders, ignoring our 
city's shameful behavior concerning the slain civil rights leader, appealed to 
the NFL to award the big game to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine the track record of America's Finest City over the last several 
years, beginning in 1986 when the San Diego City Council, in a highly 
controversial move, changed the name of Market Street to Martin Luther King 
Way. Almost immediately, a coalition arose to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, San Diegans voted overwhelmingly to strip King's name off 
the downtown thoroughfare and return the original name. 
</P>
<P>
The council then revived the issue by announcing that it was looking for 
another way to honor King. It voted to name the city's new waterfront 
convention center for him and called on the Port Commission to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The move seemed assured because the city's three appointees to the commission, 
plus National City's representative, said publicly that they would comply. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Larsen, one of San Diego's three appointees, changed his mind and 
switched his vote, scuttling another tribute to King. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter feelings about the whole ugly incident had subsided until two days 
before Election Day, when a television sportscaster told the world that Super 
Bowl XXVII might be moved to another site unless Arizonans voted in favor of 
the King holiday referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The threat revived the possibility that San Diego, a loser in the bidding for 
the 1993 Super Bowl, might get another shot at the game and affected the 
Arizona election, some believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that moment," said Bill Shover, a leading supporter of the King measure, 
"we had a 14% to 18% lead. But then came that CBS report and people here felt 
threatened. There's a lot of Barry Goldwater attitude in this state. 
Independence. Frontier independence." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hudgins, president of the Martin Luther King Better America Committee, 
added, "I think Sunday's report held a gun to the collective head of the 
Arizona electorate, which turned around and told them what to do with the Super 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the polls closed and the "nays" won by less than 1% of the 1.1 
million votes cast, the San Diego appeal, in the form of a letter from 
O'Connor, was sent to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego isn't alone. The Rose Bowl, another runner-up to Phoenix in the 
competition for Super Bowl XXVII, also wants to host the game. But as far as I 
know, Pasadena hasn't insulted King's memory the way San Diego has. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there's no telling how this will end or where the January, 1993, game 
will eventually be played. 
</P>
<P>
What does matter is that San Diego was hypocritical enough to even suggest that 
this particular game be moved here. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a loyal San Diegan and Charger fan. The money and national exposure that 
the game would bring -- Super Bowl XXII generated $125 million here in 1988 -- 
would be good for the city. I would love nothing more than to see another Super 
Bowl game played here. 
</P>
<P>
But not this game. San Diego doesn't deserve The Chutzpah Bowl any more than 
the newly orphaned child deserved leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tagliabue and Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., I 
don't believe that the Super Bowl should be played in a state that has formally 
rejected naming a holiday for King. 
</P>
<P>
And in much the same way, football would be making a horrible mistake if it 
awards the 1993 game to a city that has consistently bent over backward not to 
honor this man who sought to achieve full civil rights for all.

<TEXT>

Nora Zamichow's recent article ("In a Second, His Life Changed for the Worse," 
Nov. 12) on head injury survivor John Joseph Luz and his family was 
outstanding. As the parent of a daughter who sustained a traumatic head injury 
at age 16, and as president of the San Diego Head Injury Foundation, I read 
avidly any news coverage given this topic. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zamichow's work was exceptional in that she captured the pain, frustration 
and "torment," as Mr. Luz so thoughtfully put it, of life after head injury, 
with all its attendant cognitive and physical impairments. It was a most 
sensitive article. 
</P>
<P>
Head injury survivors and their family members need a great deal of support 
from loved ones and friends, and from self-help organizations such as ours. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Head Injury Foundation offers a monthly newsletter, educational 
meetings, support groups and an informational telephone line: (619) 569-5699. 
We invite your readers with questions to call.

SCHOOL SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is absurd that California provides schools $2,000 to $3,000 per student less 
than states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. All our schools are 
under-funded, which gives us our high class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
It is even more absurd to compare La Jolla and Lincoln high schools in terms of 
allocated funding ("School-by-School Spending Figures Cause Consternation," 
Nov. 11). Neighborhood resources, level of parent education and home support 
systems do not compare. 
</P>
<P>
All San Diego schools need the smaller class sizes and support programs which 
greater funding provides, but minority isolated schools especially do. Of 141 
incoming Lincoln ninth-graders who were tested for reading, 113 (80.1%) were 
below grade level and 58 (41.1%) were at or below sixth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla High School has the same acknowledged problems as Lincoln High School, 
but there it is primarily limited to the African-Americans and Latinos who 
voluntarily take the bus to other schools. Shame on Principal J.M. Tarvin for 
his divisive, self-serving remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Having taught at Lincoln and "north of I-8," I know that there is no more 
dedicated staff of teaching professionals anywhere than at Lincoln. While site 
control over the school budget may happen, and we may be able to use it more 
wisely, any progress will still come in incremental steps. That progress will 
come despite the political rhetoric.

HEARINGS BEGIN ON PENINSULA DISTRICT SCHOOL CLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years after a bitter battle erupted over the decision to close Miraleste 
High School because of declining enrollment, the Palos Verdes Peninsula school 
district last week began a series of public meetings to discuss campus closures 
districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
Embattled school board members forsook their board room Tuesday night for the 
larger Rolling Hills High School gymnasium to kick off the meetings. More than 
200 people sat in bleachers or folding metal chairs as parents and teachers 
took five-minute turns addressing trustees, who withheld comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the speakers' remarks made it clear that the divisiveness that has 
engulfed the community over the board's unsuccessful move to close Miraleste is 
still strong, they also made it clear that many simply want the board to act 
swiftly and end the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff is angry and frustrated," said Perry Lynn, head of the district's 
faculty association. "We have watched the community's civil war jeopardize our 
careers. . . . A decision must be made as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's meeting was the first of four that have been scheduled to receive 
public comment on a recently completed environmental impact report on school 
closures throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the district to prepare the report 
after the East Peninsula Education Council, an east-side parents' group, 
mounted a legal challenge to the board's decision to close Miraleste. Of the 
district's three high schools, Miraleste is the only one on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
But board members have stressed that comments made during the meetings will be 
used to help them do more than decide the fate of Miraleste. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members have suggested that at the fourth and final meeting, Nov. 
26, they could vote to close two of the district's three high schools, as well 
as other schools. The trustees say that consolidating campuses is the only way 
the district can become fiscally sound and keep educational programs intact. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get the word out to the community what a serious situation 
this is," board member Jeffrey Younggren said in an interview. "We are talking 
about a major reorganization of the school district." 
</P>
<P>
The district has closed seven schools in recent years as enrollment has 
declined to 9,000 pupils, about half the number of 17 years ago. This year, it 
has cut custodial and administrative ranks and has considered doing away with 
spring sports at the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday night's meeting, Supt. Michael Caston told the crowd that the 
district could face a $2.6-million deficit next year. "This is a figure that is 
almost overwhelming for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from several parent-teacher groups and a handful of parents on 
Tuesday urged the board to move ahead and consolidate campuses. One parent, 
Peggy Costello, who also teaches at the district's continuation high school, 
questioned why an environmental report needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly see this as a bogus issue," Costello said. ". . . Our community 
places a value on buildings and not on education." 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers were critical of the report, which concludes that closing 
Miraleste will not create any significant environmental impacts. Jacki McGuire, 
a district teacher and a Rolling Hills Estates councilwoman, argued that the 
report failed to properly analyze how the district would alleviate the traffic 
congestion on the peninsula's narrow roads if the school is closed or how more 
student parking would be provided at other high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
East Peninsula Education Council spokeswoman Marianne Kipper contended that the 
report was factually incomplete and contradictory in places. For example, the 
document fails to address how childrens' safety would be affected if Miraleste 
is closed and students face longer commutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right back where we started," Kipper told board members. "Let's not make 
a bad decision based on a bad document. Palos Verdes deserves better." 
</P>
<P>
EPEC President Barry Hildebrand said in an interview that the parents' group 
will continue its legal battle to keep a high school on the east side, even if 
board members ultimately decide to close two high schools. Even if a judge 
approves the environmental document, the group can appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not just going to roll over now," he said.

PARK FITNESS STAFF LAID OFF AS CARSON CUTS 15 CITY JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: FIVE MONTHS INTO THE FISCAL YEAR, CARSON IS STILL TRYING TO BALANCE ITS 
BOOKS. THE LATEST ROUND OF CUTS HIT THE PARKS DEPARTMENT HARDEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Carson laid off 15 recently hired workers last week, most of them from the 
Parks and Recreation Department, including three fitness trainers who run the 
plush Veterans Park sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
A total of eight parks workers were among those terminated according to a "last 
in, first out" directive approved by the City Council on Tuesday. The council 
has been considering spending cuts since April to balance the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the parks employees said they will lobby this weekend for support from 
Carson residents who have jammed the council chamber in the past to protest 
proposed parks cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the layoffs were spread among other city departments, an official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday -- almost five months into the fiscal year -- the City Council will 
continue its efforts to draw up a final budget. Last week the council proposed 
a freeze on wages and benefits for city employees. Whether the employees' 
unions agree to the freeze will determine whether there will be additional 
layoffs, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Park was controversial long before it opened in June. Recently critics 
have said the park, like the Parks and Recreation Department itself, is too 
expensive to operate. Its sports complex, which operates as a membership 
fitness club, was hit especially hard by the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the facility, Jackie Crimi, the fitness director, Cindy Ward, 
and the assistant director, Jay Waldren, all got layoff notices Thursday. All 
had been recruited for the jobs they took this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Crimi said it was a joke to include her job in cuts that were made on the basis 
of seniority. "This is going to do nothing to solve their budget problems," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Crimi said, the cuts threaten the health club's viability by reducing 
its ability to attract new members, the key to generating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The employees who took their places are not trained to run the facility, know 
nothing about sales and marketing, and are not professional fitness trainers, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Crimi, who has a master's degree in physiology from Cal State Long Beach and 
has worked in sales and marketing at other health clubs, said: "The people (the 
city) has stuck in there have no idea what they are doing. . . . I'm the one 
who created (the club) from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
Crimi also claimed that uncertainty about whether the city will continue to 
operate the complex has caused some current members to demand a refund. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Jack Smith would not return phone calls Thursday and Friday. 
Other city officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilwoman Juanita McDonald said that although she opposes layoffs, 
she supports the decision to include the fitness directors in the dismissals if 
they must be made. Her objection, she said, was to the manner in which the 
dismissals were implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that there wasn't sufficient notice given" and that there was 
no transition period for replacements to be trained, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
In its first five months of operation, the park has generated more than 
$100,000 in fees, well ahead of a projection of $156,000 for the entire year, 
parks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Crimi said the sports complex has about 700 paid, active memberships. The 
membership retention rate is 92%. 
</P>
<P>
The 38,000-square-foot sports complex includes a multipurpose gymnasium, a 
gymnastics and aerobics center and a weight room. The city charges residents 
$15 to $40 a month to use the facilities. Non-residents pay twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the three trainers were to be spared from the parks department 
cuts, but longtime employees and residents objected to giving the three new 
employees preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the city is considering asking an outside company to run the 
fitness center. If that happens, the employees who have been moved into those 
jobs might face layoffs or transfers in turn.

NORTHRIDGE SCHOOL A MUST ON THE EDUCATORS' TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
LEARNING: THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IS BEING DESCRIBED AS THE FRONT-RUNNER IN THE 
EVOLUTION OF JUNIOR HIGHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a scene not unusual in Southern California: a tour bus unloading 
sightseers from towns such as Cumberland, R.I., and Eau Claire, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most tourists, this group of 23 teachers and school administrators 
was more interested in math lessons than movie stars. To heck with Hollywood. 
They came to see heterogeneous grouping. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Junior High School was the main attraction Friday on a special tour 
by members of the National Middle School Assn., in town last week for their 
annual convention. Although the association scheduled visits to five other city 
schools, Northridge is considered the shining star in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, far ahead of others locally in what education experts are 
describing as the evolution of junior high. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes into the tour it was clear that for most, junior high school was 
never like this: 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge there are no lockers. The 1,000 students enrolled at the school, 
80% of whom are minority, get to pick at least two non-graded classes each 
semester. Every week teachers counsel youngsters on matters from romance to 
study habits. Smart kids and average kids sit side by side in just about every 
classroom. Attendance is up, discipline problems are down and, on this day at 
least, everybody is smiling, braces and all. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important measure is the smile level," Principal Beryl Ward said. "Do 
the teachers feel like they are respected and valued? Are they excited about 
what they are doing? Are the kids happy to be here? Are they having a good 
time?" 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good, say faculty, students and district officials. Beginning this 
fall, after some years of planning, Northridge started its middle school plan. 
It is supposed to combine for the school's sixth- through eighth-grade students 
the personal nurturing of elementary school with the academic choices of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior high schools have been modeled after high schools, a structure designed 
for 15- to 20-year-olds," said John Liechty, the district administrator in 
charge of planning changes in the way junior high schools operate in Los 
Angeles. "We need to restructure them for the needs of 10- to 15-year-olds. At 
Northridge, I believe they are hitting on something that will make a dramatic 
difference for those students." 
</P>
<P>
The methods being tried at Northridge derive from studies of junior high 
schools by the Carnegie Foundation and the state Department of Education, and 
from others released in the past decade. Educators, especially in urban areas 
such as Los Angeles, agree that problems such as high dropout rates and low 
college eligibility are traceable to junior high school troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Students between 10 and 15 are social, emotional, physical and academic 
beings," said John H. Lounsvury, publications editor of the National Middle 
School Assn., a nonprofit research group that includes teachers, administrators 
and academicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, high schools ignore, for example, their social interests," said 
Lounsvury, a retired professor of education at Georgia College. "While school 
is not a party, you have to make sure they are having a good time, remembering 
that they are not children who will always do as they are told and not adults 
who will operate independently." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the fun at Northridge comes during seventh period on Mondays and 
Fridays. That is when students have one of nearly 50 non-graded courses such as 
knitting, ceramics, calligraphy and basketball. Students sign up every 10 weeks 
for the classes, which are taught by teachers also responsible for recruiting 
their enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped at the chance to teach sewing," longtime English teacher Walt Uchiek 
said. "It's a great stress reliever." 
</P>
<P>
One of his students, Carlos Basulto, 11, said it has been fun so far learning 
how to use the school's sewing machines, which until this year had been stored 
unused for nearly a decade. "I've made some cushions and pillows," Basulto, a 
sixth-grade student, said. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say students of junior high school age should be encouraged to try 
different courses before high school, when college entrance requirements leave 
little time for photography, music, poetry or crafts. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools need to accommodate their growing curiosity and ability to experiment 
before the hardball starts in high school," Lounsvury said. 
</P>
<P>
Across campus, another group of sixth-graders is studying math and the metric 
system by competing in games that require them to estimate the weight of 
marbles, the distance between the stage of the school auditorium and the back 
row, and the number of square centimeters in their own footprints. Watching 
over the group are math, social studies and English teachers who form one of 
the school's teaching teams, responsible for a group of about 120 students. 
</P>
<P>
"By getting their hands on it, they can actually see math," math teacher Grace 
Hutchings said. "I want them to be able to not only do the work on paper but to 
eyeball distance and make estimations." 
</P>
<P>
In accord with the team method at Northridge, Hutchings will help her 
colleagues with their lessons later in the semester. Elsewhere at the school, 
history teachers will teach about the Civil War while English teachers on the 
same team will have students read the Gettysburg Address. 
</P>
<P>
During seventh period on Wednesdays, students go to classes where they are 
expected to do no more than make friends with each other and the teacher. The 
purpose is for teachers to become acquainted with students who are not hustling 
for a grade, but who may want advice on matters important to them, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The students learn to set goals, as well as self-esteem building techniques 
and conflict resolution," said Susie Shapiro, a Northridge coordinator and 
teacher. "Teachers learn to be advocates for the students." 
</P>
<P>
Students are also learning from each other, officials said. In what is known as 
heterogeneous grouping, students are no longer divided according to ability, 
which tended to keep gifted children away from average children. Instead, 
students are mixed randomly by computer in all of the academic courses. The 
idea is that bright children are not hurt by sharing courses with slower 
students and slower students are helped a lot by having brighter students in 
their classes, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say discipline problems have declined this year. Most school 
suspensions have been eliminated, replaced by so-called in-house suspensions, 
in which a student is disciplined by being kept away from other students in a 
room supervised by a campus employee. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit of the practice is that most students hate it, and the school does 
not lose any income from the state, which pays the schools based on daily 
attendance, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials eliminated the use of lockers, which in cities such as Los 
Angeles have become repositories for guns and drugs. Students do not seem to 
mind the change because they do not have to lug any books at all. The school 
issues students a set of books for the classroom and a second for the home. 
</P>
<P>
All these programs are extra work for teachers without extra pay. One benefit 
of the new program for teachers, however, is an extra 80 minutes a week for 
team planning sessions. Some of the teachers said they do not mind the extra 
work because they believe it will translate into better achievement by 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Physical education teacher Marilyn Hayes said most are enthusiastic about the 
new program because it was designed and carried out mostly by teachers. The 
innovations being tried at Northridge come as schools districtwide are asked to 
share greater and greater decision-making powers with teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that Northridge made the most sweeping changes of any junior high 
school in the district under past school district rules, which gave most power 
to school principals, rather than under the district's shared decision making 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and other teachers say it is because the principal has allowed them to 
try new ideas. Principal Ward says innovation is good as long as everyone keeps 
in mind the goal of providing better education for students. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers want to be the captains of their own ship, but I remind them they are 
sailing with the fleet," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing Northridge, visitor Bob Wallace, a Cumberland, R.I., principal, 
said, "This is a shot in the arm for me personally and a motivator."

POLLUTING CATTLE RANCHERS COULD LOSE PERMITS

Ranchers who allow cattle to contaminate a major stream feeding Lake Casitas 
could lose their grazing permits, Casitas Municipal Water District directors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir west of Ojai supplies drinking water to about 55,000 residents in 
western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Manure and decomposing cattle along Santa Ana Creek have been a problem for 
years, officials said, despite enforcement attempts by the U.S. Forest Service 
and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas district directors decided this week to ask the water quality board to 
reopen its investigation into Earl Holder's ranch operations and look at two 
other ranches in Santa Ana Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Holder was found to have violated state health regulations and Forest 
Service grazing rules after Casitas officials complained of manure and animal 
carcasses along the creek. 
</P>
<P>
The water quality board ordered the Forest Service last year to force Holder to 
remove the manure and keep his cattle away from the creek. The rancher has 
complied with some requirements, Casitas engineers said, but he needs to do 
more or his lease will be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only one in that canyon that keeps it clean and is not doing any 
grazing," said Holder, who was surprised by the complaint. "As far as I know 
I've done everything I was supposed to. Nobody has told me differently." 
</P>
<P>
Holder, owner of Offshore Crane Co., said he has a five-acre lease for horses 
but keeps his cattle penned on his own land. "All the surrounding land that 
drains into Santa Ana Creek is leased out to cattle. That's where your 
contamination is coming from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Casitas engineers said the three ranches along the creek are of 
specific concern. Water samples taken over the past two years indicate minor 
bacteria contamination. Chlorination can deal with small amounts, engineers 
said, but a major storm could worsen the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant's report recommended in 1972 that no livestock be allowed in the 
lake's watershed. District and state officials decided that building a 
$25-million water treatment plant was the best way to meet state and federal 
water- quality standards because there are other sources of pollution, such as 
recreation in Los Padres National Forest. The plant is expected to be built by 
1994. THIA BELL

It has been good for me to see these beautiful people and this beautiful 
country at peace. All my memories of VN were of war, suffering and destruction. 
I sort of loved this country though they sent us here for war. Now that it's 
free, I love it even more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- from the diary of Charles Nixon, 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Sept. 12, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
War veteran Charles Nixon returned to Vietnam this fall chiefly for 
intellectual reasons -- to travel in a Third World country and, as he put it, 
to witness firsthand the effects of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because he was an ambulance driver during his 1966-67 Army stint in 
Saigon and, by his own account, was spared much of the war's horrors. He came 
home to finish college, hold a steady job, marry a woman who's become his soul 
mate, and start a successful contracting business -- hardly the tormented 
postwar experiences of some others. 
</P>
<P>
He was caught off guard, then, by his roller coaster emotions during the recent 
visit and by the inexplicable power that Vietnam and his long-dormant memories 
of it held over him. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to go back and visit a country at peace and learn more," Nixon said 
recently in the den of his Woodland Hills home. "I didn't expect to be so moved 
by the country. It was a tremendous emotional experience for me and caught me 
by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing for me was all I knew about Vietnam, all my images of 
Vietnam, were from the war, and I had nothing to replace them with," said 
Nixon, 46, a tall, striking man who said he was brought up to fear Communists 
and feelings. "Now, I have a whole country, and people, and sunsets." 
</P>
<P>
Between Sept. 4 and Oct. 30, Nixon joined seven other veterans on a "peace and 
reconciliation mission" outside Hanoi, a six-week adventure during which they 
helped rebuild a medical clinic in the village of Yen Vien. According to the 
Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project (VVRP), the nonprofit group that organized 
the trip, the clinic had been out of use since it was destroyed by U.S. bombs 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and his colleagues lived in a guest house with dormitory-like quarters 
and worked side by side with their former enemies. All were in their 40s, five 
of the eight were unmarried. Several suffered post-traumatic stress as a result 
of fighting in the war. They took side trips organized by the local branch of 
the Communist Party, and followed the orders of Vietnamese construction 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran flew home to Kentucky during the first week after acknowledging 
that he didn't feel comfortable around the Vietnamese, couldn't work with them 
and couldn't control his paranoia. Others, such as Nixon's roommate from Maine, 
grew so close to their foreign co-workers that they wept like children when 
they said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 This country at peace is beautiful. Why did our government rain such awful 
destruction on these people? It seems that VN is a national sore spot. Guess 
Washington learned some lessons from the experience but were they the right 
ones? The American people still don't understand the U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon diary, 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Sept. 12 
</P>
<P>
It was the third such trip for the 2-year-old VVRP, which operates with a small 
staff and donated funds in Garberville, Calif. Although Vietnam Veterans of 
America has sponsored several tours in the past three years, VVRP is the only 
such group that provides humanitarian aid to Vietnam, organizing volunteers to 
help build medical facilities and donating medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years after the controversial war ended, organized American travel to 
Vietnam is still illegal because the U.S. government maintains a trade embargo 
with the country, refusing to restore normal diplomatic and commercial 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The trips sponsored by VVRP, however, are sanctioned under a 1987 agreement 
between the two countries that allows private groups to provide humanitarian 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are actually participating in the construction of facilities and the trips 
are just a side matter," said Scott Rutherford, VVRP's development coordinator, 
adding that another trip is planned next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon described the trip as a rewarding but extremely difficult experience, in 
which the group's internal dynamics, difficult as they were, were compounded 
daily by the frustrations of working in a foreign culture. They had to cope 
with language and cultural barriers, the intense, Southeast Asian heat and 
claustrophobic humidity, "Ho Chi Minh's Revenge" and a debilitating virus that 
struck the group. 
</P>
<P>
The trip didn't change his life, Nixon said, but affirmed his political 
convictions that nations have a right to self-determination and the U.S. should 
not interfere. It also furthered his long effort to show emotion more openly. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, he would work on the construction site until the early afternoon 
or until he succumbed to the heat, hauling buckets of concrete and bricks by 
hand or shoveling debris. Even to Nixon, a contractor, it was back-breaking 
work. 
</P>
<P>
He read a lot of Vietnamese history, and eventually felt relaxed enough to take 
long bike rides through Hanoi, an ancient city of parks and trees he said he 
prefers even to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He had been euphoric after a four-day orientation session in rural Sebastopol, 
where a pair of psychologists helped the travelers get to know each other and 
guided them through their tangle of feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past four days have, as everyone admits, seemed more like four weeks. As 
a group we seemed to have come together, feel closer. The self-revelations and 
acceptance by others has increased feelings of trust and caring. Truly a unique 
experience, I felt like I had gone through a sort of emotional Basic Training." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon's diary on Tuesday, 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 4, as the group prepared 
</P>
<P>
to leave the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For Nixon -- who avoided war protests when he came home because he "wanted to 
get on with my life" -- it was the first time he had been exposed directly to 
other veterans' suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"One vet told about the first time he shot someone in combat," Nixon said. "He 
was ambushed by three North Vietnamese and shot one in the chest. The guy cried 
out in pain. Twenty years later, he still remembers it and feels guilty about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Another, a Medal of Honor recipient, revealed a scar on his torso that "looks 
like a road map" Nixon said. Another was homeless. Another had lost several 
friends from the blue-collar town in New England where they grew up and were 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
But group members drifted apart. One of Nixon's biggest disappointments was 
that once in Vietnam "people retreated into their own shells and acted like 
they did during the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group held a few, loosely organized "rap" sessions, but the meetings 
weren't held regularly. And Nixon's efforts to record his colleagues' lives 
before, during and after the war were rejected in a few cases, increasing his 
loneliness and feelings of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said he thinks future trips should include a psychologist or counselor as 
an escort, a suggestion Rutherford said VVRP was seriously considering. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep thinking all feelings are not so pleasant but they all are better than 
feeling dead or numb. I've opened myself up to a lot of pain etc., but it feels 
like the right thing to do. Reaching out to those people at the restaurant was 
the right thing to do even if it hurt a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon diary, Monday, Oct. 15 
</P>
<P>
A human rights activist who has traveled in Cuba and Central America with his 
wife, Louise, Nixon was anxious to meet and talk with Vietnamese and learn how 
the Communist society worked. Sometimes he succeeded, and on his last night in 
Hanoi enjoyed dinner with a couple of government information agents he had 
talked to all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But Nixon said he also had a few frustrating encounters with Vietnamese -- 
possibly because of the language barrier, but also, he thinks, because of 
lingering bitterness from the war. One evening, he had struck up a conversation 
with a restaurant manager and she ordered a pot of tea -- in Vietnam, a gesture 
of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's husband joined them and after a while, Nixon invited the couple and 
their 6-year-old daughter to see a movie the following night. They made a date, 
and the husband even offered to pick up Nixon at his guest house. 
</P>
<P>
But the new bond came apart when Nixon got his dinner bill. He realized the 
woman had charged him for the "friendship" tea, and for a hot steamed towel he 
hadn't ordered but used to be polite. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon says he paid the higher amount, although it was clear he was upset. At 
that point, he recalled, the woman's husband began a pantomime of a soldier 
with a machine gun and, looking directly at Nixon, repeated "B-52 pilot, B-52 
pilot" -- shorthand for the ultimate enemy to the North Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really hurt and felt betrayed," Nixon later wrote in his diary. "I felt 
like I opened up and made a friendly gesture and got kicked you-know-where." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on the last day of work Nixon's group held a banquet for their Vietnamese 
co-workers and many of the Vietnamese and Americans cried, Nixon included. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen Ted and Truy sitting together before dinner, Ted 6 feet 2 inches, 
240 pounds, carpenter-veteran; Truy 5 feet 4 inches 130 pounds," Nixon wrote 
about his roommate and the man's Vietnamese friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Truy was leaning against Ted with his head on Ted's shoulder. Truy, the NVA 
soldier who could have killed some of the friends that Ted lost in the war, was 
like a puppy about to be separated from his mother. So was Ted. So was I. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all deeply moved. This was the hardest parting I've ever experienced. 
I've cried at partings a little in the past, but never like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

EXCERPTS FROM YEN VIEN DIARY 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 9 
</P>
<P>
 We went for walk to Hanoi. Left 10 a.m., warm and humid. Traffic crazy, people 
friendly, smiles and greetings by many. Do they know we are U.S. or not? 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 10 
</P>
<P>
 One lady refused us service in her shop. Why? Because we were U.S.? Could she 
have lost family to U.S. bombs or the war? Who knows? Maybe I should go back 
with a note from my translator and ask tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 11 
</P>
<P>
 This is our 2nd day on the job site. The rare combination of heat, humidity 
and hard work has humbled even the most proud of us. No one wants to impress 
the Vietnamese now. We are all hoping to be able to survive a full day. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 15 
</P>
<P>
 I am looking at the faces of these bright, healthy, beautiful children. I'm 
reminded of the thousands and thousands of children we must have killed with 
bombs and napalm during the war. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 19 
</P>
<P>
 Feel nervous walking in crowds at the marketplace. So many people and anyone 
could do something. Heard an Australian tourist was stabbed to death in the 
street in Hanoi a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 21 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody here seems to be really stressed out. The work is boring and we 
don't know what to do. Illness, lack of familiar things. The noise from the 
traffic, horns honking, etc. is horrendous. We are planning on American movies 
and dinner tomorrow to relieve the stress. Help. I'm homesick. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 6 
</P>
<P>
It has been good for me to see these beautiful people and this beautiful 
country at peace. All my memories of VN were of war, suffering and destruction. 
I sort of loved this country though they sent us here for war. Now that it's 
free, I love it even more. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 7 
</P>
<P>
 The VN know how to build and we are learning from them, NOT the other way 
around. Last time the US came here and tried to control the VN and get them to 
do things the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 10 
</P>
<P>
 The people's committee took us to a variety show in Hanoi tonight. It was 
interesting. Singers, comedians, even some acrobats. Even did the lambada 
within one mile of Communist Party Headquarters. Decadent!

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard and Navy search teams Saturday discovered the body of a San 
Pedro man who was at the helm of a small aircraft that crashed on San Clemente 
Island, about 45 miles west of San Diego, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine plane was spotting for a San Pedro-based fishing vessel, the 
Santa Maria, the Coast Guard said, when it crashed on the island, which is used 
by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot was identified as Robert W. Bacon, 55. A Coast Guard helicopter was 
to take his remains to the San Diego County Medical Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon was alone in the Cessna 172, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal safety officials are investigating the crash. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour search, a Coast Guard crew aboard a Falcon jet spotted the 
downed aircraft shortly before noon in the middle of San Clemente Island, 
officials said. The fishing vessel had last heard from the aircraft at 3:30 
a.m., authorities said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: 2 DIE, 2 HURT IN WRONG-WAY DRIVER CRASH ON I-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were killed and two others seriously injured early Saturday in a 
head-on collision caused by a wrong-way driver along Interstate 15, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of both vehicles were killed at the scene, which was in the 
northbound lanes of the busy freeway, just north of Miramar Way. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 3:15 a.m., authorities said, when a car headed south 
in the northbound lanes of I-15 crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the dead drivers were being withheld pending notification of 
relatives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong-way driver was alone in the car, the highway patrol said, but two 
passengers in the northbound vehicle suffered serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger, Ronald Anderson, 30, of Long Beach, was in fair condition at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Ronald Winters, 35, of Huntington Beach, was in serious condition at 
Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP is investigating the incident.

DIAL 'H' FOR HEADACHE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATION: AN ESCONDIDO COUPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE EXPANDING THEIR SMALL 
BUSINESS WITH A NEW 800 NUMBER. WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INSTEAD IS A PLAGUE OF 
WRONG NUMBERS AND MAYBE A HEFTY PHONE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"I'm sorry, you have the wrong number." 
</P>
<P>
Janice and Joe Maples of Escondido have repeated that phrase hundreds of times 
in the past month. It's a pain. But what really hurts is that the calls are 
costing them hundreds of dollars and tying up their business phone. 
</P>
<P>
The Mapleses installed an 800 number a month ago in an effort to expand their 
small emergency preparedness kit business in Escondido by reaching out to 
customers and distributors throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It just triples our sales when we have our 800 number, and when people can get 
through," said Janice Maples, who has distributors in four states and sends out 
catalogues of their emergency kits. 
</P>
<P>
But, about the same time, New York state's Department of Motor Vehicles began 
its own toll-free number for commercial truckers looking for information on 
getting a commercial driver's license, a new state requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The number of the New York information line was 1-800-CDL-INFO, but somehow the 
number has been getting lost in translation with many truckers dialing 
1-800-CDL-HELP, which is the Maples' number. 
</P>
<P>
"These calls start early, early in the morning," said Janice Maples, who with 
her husband distributes earthquake preparedness kits containing food, blankets 
and sanitary supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had calls as early as 2:45 in the morning from a bus driver who got the 
number in a bar," said Janice Maples. 
</P>
<P>
Maples doesn't know exactly how much the mix-up has cost her, but she and her 
husband guess it will be more than $1,000, and they are anxiously waiting for 
the phone bill to arrive next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just starting out, and this is a killer. Things are hard enough as it is 
without complications like this," Janice Maples said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that a man from the Ryder truck line called and told my husband that 
they got the number from the DMV. Even the sanitation department of New York 
has been calling me." 
</P>
<P>
Maples said she even received a call from a New York trucker saying that the 
number was on a freeway billboard near the Pennsylvania border. The DMV has 
heard a similar rumor, but has not found the billboard. The DMV said that they 
have not used billboards to advertise the information line, only brochures and 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, DMV officials said that all brochures, packets and posters 
regarding a commercial driver's license have had the correct number on it, and 
that they are not at fault. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not distributing the Mapleses' number," said George Filieau, spokesman 
for the DMV. "It is conceivable that our employees confused the suffixes and in 
some instances may have given (truckers) that number to call instead of the 
correct number." 
</P>
<P>
Filieau said that, once the department became aware of the potential mix-up, it 
issued an electronic memo to all of its offices to alert employees that they 
may have been giving out the wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
But Janice Maples said the calls have not stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are still giving my number out, and nothing I do works," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the DMV refuses to accept blame, at least one elected official in 
New York offers evidence of the state's mistake and who feels that the DMV owes 
the Mapleses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a total embarrassment to the state of New York," said Francis O'Keefe, 
mayor of Glens Falls, N.Y., who found out about the wrong numbers from city 
employees who had called the number for information after getting it from the 
DMV. "I'm damned mad about it, this shouldn't happen to a small business." 
</P>
<P>
Maples said she received more than one call from truckers in pay phones just 
outside DMV offices who had gotten the wrong number from DMV employees. 
</P>
<P>
Maples said that, even if it is just an inadvertent mistake on the part of a 
handful of DMV employees, she still should receive restitution. 
</P>
<P>
"What they said is we're sorry, that they realize that this is a mix-up and 
that it's costing us money, but they can't get anyone in the upper levels to 
give us restitution to us financially," she said. "Their suggestion to us would 
be to get an attorney and sue." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to me how they got the number, the DMV is responsible for 
their people. If my employees did something wrong, it would be a reflection on 
me, and I would be responsible for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV, however, doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Although DMV officials say they sympathize with the Mapleses' position, they 
have no plans to compensate them. 
</P>
<P>
Legal action "in fact may be the only alternative because one of the problems 
here is how can we authorize New York taxpayer money for payment to a company 
that can't verify that these phone calls result from something that the DMV 
did," Filieau said. "Who is going to prove that these phone calls resulted from 
our employees giving out the number?" 
</P>
<P>
Short of tape recording the phone calls, Filieau said he doesn't see how the 
Mapleses could prove that the calls are coming from truckers who have been 
misdirected by the DMV as opposed to truckers who may have gotten the numbers 
confused themselves or who had seen the number in a different context. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded, however, that it is likely that at least some of the calls that 
the Mapleses are getting may have been the result of mistakes by DMV employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that we've done anything wrong that requires us to compensate 
them," Filieau said. "An inadvertent slip of the tongue by an employee, we 
don't know that we are responsible for paying that back." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor O'Keefe said he has tried to help by contacting the New York secretary of 
state's office, which then contacted the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"Their response was that they got in touch with Mr. and Mrs. Maples, and 
they're trying to straighten out the situation, and they'll get their money 
back," O'Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mapleses have yet to hear from anyone in the New York DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"They have never called us, all the communication has been one-sided, us 
calling them," Janice Maples said.

HYPERION WORK DAMAGED NEARBY HOUSE, SUIT ALLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former South Bay police chief is suing the city of Los Angeles, claiming that 
vibration from construction work at the Hyperion sewage plant has damaged his 
nearby El Segundo home. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Stroh, police chief of El Segundo from 1966 to 1970 and of Inglewood from 
1971 to 1981, says earthmoving and pile driving on plant property caused 
cracking in his floor, driveway and patio, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Stroh, now the director of the state Department of Alcoholic 
Beverage Control, claims that the cracks first appeared in November of last 
year, during a huge earth excavation project at Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the chandelier and ceiling fans moving, and there was no 
earthquake," Stroh said. Pointing out that he and his wife, Jackie, have lived 
in their Hillcrest Avenue home for more than 20 years, he said, "the damage 
wasn't there before they started doing it, and it's there now." 
</P>
<P>
The city rejects the claims contained in the Torrance Superior Court suit filed 
this month, which also names Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the insurer of the 
Stroh's home. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff said that city-paid soil experts took 
measurements in the Hillcrest Avenue area and determined that the vibrations 
were not strong enough to cause structural damage. If there was cracking at the 
Strohs' house, he said, it is because the building sits on unstable land. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way our construction did this," Westhoff said. "They are on an 
uncompacted, sandy and (sloping) soil which is cut way too steep. It would 
creep regardless of what we did at Hyperion." 
</P>
<P>
At issue are the effects of massive excavations that form part of a 
$600-million project to rebuild Hyperion, a city of Los Angeles sewage 
treatment plant in Playa Del Rey between El Segundo and Dockweiler Beach. 
</P>
<P>
According to Westhoff, about 20 El Segundo homeowners have filed claims 
alleging property damage as a result of the work. He said the city has settled 
more than a dozen of the claims at a total cost of about $50,000 and is 
settling several more, using a $2-million fund set aside for the purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh's is the first claim to progress to a lawsuit. The city rejected his 
claim in May, but Westhoff would not rule out a settlement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be silly to turn down a settlement that I believe is reasonable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said the city considers the settlements cost-saving steps aimed at 
avoiding expensive court battles and rejects the view that, by settling, the 
city might be admitting that its sewage project has caused property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Ayscough, Stroh's attorney, acknowledged that he has no scientific 
evidence of a link between the construction work at Hyperion and the cracking 
in his client's home. But he said he plans to hire an expert to study the 
matter and is confident that the findings will support Stroh. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses don't sit someplace for 20 years and then all of a sudden, in a matter 
of a few months, they start to crack," he said. "With the relative suddenness 
of it all, it just seems highly unlikely that there's no connection" between 
the Hyperion work and the cracking. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff challenged Ayscough to provide proof: "If they are able to demonstrate 
through their experts that our experts don't know what they're talking about, 
then fine."

FORMER VAN NUYS GUARD UNITS HEAD FOR SAUDI SUPPLY DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDUP: NINETY-THREE VOLUNTEERS AND THREE CARGO PLANES DEPART THE 146TH 
TACTICAL AIRLIFT WING'S NEW OXNARD BASE FOR 'AIR BRIDGE' BASED IN GERMANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Air National Guard unit based until recently at Van Nuys Airport 
joined the Saudi Arabian military buildup with aircraft and crews this week. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing's 16 cargo planes and 93 volunteers 
left for Frankfurt, Germany, to become part of the "air bridge" ferrying troops 
and supplies from the United States to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Vince Cocca of Lake View Terrace was in the pilot's seat of one of the 
three C-130s that left Thursday from the Channel Islands Air National Guard 
Base near Oxnard, the unit's home since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The three planes, carrying 71 volunteers, were headed for a first stop at Goose 
Bay in Newfoundland, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 30 degrees in Goose Bay, a warm day for them," Cocca, a TWA flight 
engineer in civilian life, told his colleagues in a preflight briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The four-engine C-130s were to meet a fourth plane from the Oxnard base that 
left Tuesday for the Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt. The planes and crew 
members will be based there, transporting supplies, equipment and personnel 
across Europe and possibly to the Middle East, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 146th had dispatched about 50 cargo handlers and medical 
technicians to Saudi Arabia. But this week marked the first time that the wing 
sent flight crew members and cargo planes overseas to help with the buildup of 
troops and weaponry in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The wing and its predecessors had been based at Van Nuys Airport since the 
early 1950s and its ranks include many men and women from the San Fernando 
Valley and throughout the Los Angeles area. The wing moved to its new home near 
Oxnard because the Van Nuys Airport air guard installation, a former World War 
II Air Force base, closed in April due to congested flying conditions and the 
rising fees charged by the city of Los Angeles, which owns the airport. 
</P>
<P>
So far, wing members sent overseas have been volunteers. But officials said 
they probably will be asked to activate at least some of the wing's 1,400 
reservists to help meet the call-up of an additional 72,500 National Guard and 
reserve troops authorized this week by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
At the Air National Guard base Thursday, the volunteer flight crews and 
mechanics arrived before dawn to prepare for the initial nine-hour leg of their 
flight to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were issued new identification cards and made sure that their 
military paychecks would be electronically deposited into checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the citizen-soldiers, it was an emotional parting from family 
members worried about war erupting in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching a double handful of junk food for the long flight, Sgt. Angela 
Bateman said she had not realized the risk of flying into a potential war zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically, I know this could be something serious, but emotionally it hasn't 
sunk in yet," said Bateman, a Camarillo resident. "We all have a lot of mixed 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Before departure, many of the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing members joked around 
on the Tarmac. There was a mixture of excitement about the adventure and a 
gallows humor about making it home alive. "It is something that you can't help 
but think about," Sgt. Robert Bonino of Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as excited as some of the younger guys," said Tech. Sgt. Ray C. 
Perkins of Simi Valley. "I've been to Vietnam, so I know what war is all about. 
I've been to hot spots before." 
</P>
<P>
Before departure, each reservist went through a last-minute briefing on how to 
handle live bombs, missiles or other ordnance, including chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is a real low charge, it is probably a chemical agent," warned Capt. 
Rick Gibson, the mission's operations officer who led the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson instructed all the reservists to make sure that they replace the 
training filters in their gas masks with new filters to be issued before they 
enter Saudi Arabia. "I don't have to stress how important this is before going 
'in country,' " Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to carry identification at all times, on and off the 
base. "Right now, the biggest threat we have over there is terrorism," Gibson 
said. "They will be checking ID at the hotel, on base and just about anywhere 
you go." 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought he was going to Germany, but he's not," said Leslie Zuniga, 
wife of Sgt. Jerry Zuniga, an airplane mechanic. "He is going to fly back and 
forth to Saudi Arabia. He won't be fighting; he'll be carrying supplies. You 
wonder if they'll want to knock out the supply planes." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Zuniga tried to comfort his wife as he worked his way through the 
processing line with his son, Andrew, 7, seated on his shoulders. "She's not 
used to this," Zuniga said. "This is the first time I've deployed since I've 
been married." 
</P>
<P>
Zuniga predicted that he would be home before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if someone pulls a trigger, we'll be over there a year."

RUTH C. JONES; RETIRED KINDERGARTEN TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth C. Jones, who taught kindergarten at Newhall Elementary School for about 
40 years, has died at a Valencia hospital. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jones died Wednesday of natural causes, according to a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Born June 28, 1904, in Hibbing, Minn., she began teaching kindergarten at 
Newhall Elementary School in the early 1920s. Upon her retirement in 1962, the 
school declared a Ruth Jones Day and honored her with an open house, said Betty 
Granger, principal of Old Orchard Elementary School in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
For several years after she left Newhall Elementary, she would return on the 
first day of school to greet the new kindergarten pupils. The walls of her room 
at the Santa Clarita Convalescent Hospital, where she most recently lived, at 
times were decorated with artwork done by schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
She has no immediate survivors. Her husband, Wallace Jones, died in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Services are private. Eternal Valley Mortuary in Newhall is handling the 
arrangements.

NEEDED: ALTERNATIVE TO PROTECT THE RIDGELINES IN LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 4,000 registered voters of Laguna Niguel have expressed their desire 
to see our remaining ridgelines protected from further development. 
</P>
<P>
In its haste to 1) enlighten those of us who signed the ridgeline initiative 2) 
divert attention to the union in Vegas that apparently contributed to the 
initiative 3) protect their own interests and 4) demean the backers of the 
initiatives, the City Council has utterly failed to keep the original intent in 
mind: Our community wants its ridgelines protected! 
</P>
<P>
So the initiative wasn't worded well. We see that now. So a lot of innocent 
people would be gravely affected by the initiative. We now understand that, 
thank you. So the initiative could wind up potentially bankrupting our new 
city. We can't have that now, can we? These are all consequences we don't want 
to see come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
But what hasn't been addressed is an alternative to the ridgeline initiative 
that is strong, yet fair. Why hasn't the council made any efforts toward that 
end? And if they have, why not present it? The council's name-calling, 
back-stabbing and threatened lawsuits are unproductive and don't really address 
Laguna Niguel's concerns for the remaining ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
I think that a fair yet substantive alternative ordinance proposal, with some 
involvement from those involved with the initiative and the community as a 
whole, would go a long way toward easing property owners' concerns. It would 
also go a long way toward giving those of us against ridgeline development a 
reason to feel as though our council has heard us. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't ridgeline development one of the biggest concerns during the cityhood 
drive? That was one long year ago! The council mustn't continue to stall while 
leaving the door open for developers to finalize more devastating developments. 
Give us what we have all dreamed of for years: local control and sensible 
protection of our remaining ridgelines.

'UFO' WITH A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of startled San Diego County residents called police to report a UFO, 
which turned out to be a blimp on its maiden advertising voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Lighted brightly in the night sky to attract attention, the blimp did exactly 
that Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Chula Vista, National City and San Diego say they got a number of 
calls from residents worried about an invasion from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
"People think they are seeing UFOs and it's weird," a Chula Vista police 
dispatcher said. "They see a big thing glowing in the sky and then want to call 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The suspected flying saucer is owned by San Diego-based Virgin Lightships, 
which is part of the London-based business group that includes Virgin Atlantic 
Airways. 
</P>
<P>
It arrived this week at its new base at Brown Field in Otay Mesa, and was 
making its first voyage through the area as an advertising ploy. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say up to 23 of the blimps are scheduled to be built within 
five years to advertise for clients throughout the United States and Europe. 
They rent for about $250,000 a month.

COUPLE'S 'RICH' CATEGORY RICHLY UNEARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where did we go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
According to our new tax category, Congress has classified us as "rich." Our 
combined incomes are $101,000 before deductions. 
</P>
<P>
We drive two American, mid-priced cars that are 5 years old. We live in a 
remodeled tract house. 
</P>
<P>
We never go out to eat. It's been four years since we had a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
I cut coupons, everyone's hair, and collect wood to heat the house from the 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Our two teen-agers attend the University of California; tuition is $3,600 for 
both and housing is $12,000 for both. They work part-time for all other 
expenses. They are B-plus students, so neither qualifies for scholarships, and 
our combined income removes us from financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, there is never any money left over. Our only deduction is the mortgage 
payment; we have never had enough after doctor, dentist, orthodontist, auto 
repair and insurance bills to be able to invest in any tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
So who is going to get hit with Congress' new tax plans? People like us, whom 
they call rich.

STAR-STUDDED GATES BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading in your paper about the trials and tribulations of Sheriff Brad 
Gates, I would like to suggest that the Republican Party have a fund-raiser to 
take the taxpayers and the good sheriff off the hook on his latest lawsuit 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
For guest speakers, the party could have former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, he could explain how nobody told him what was happening concerning 
the Iran-Contra debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Second, President Bush could tell us why he is blocking the release of his 
Iran-Contra papers to the special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Third, we could have Ollie North demonstrate how to use a paper shredder with 
out jamming it. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Richard Nixon would be ideal; maybe he could tell us what was missing 
on the erased tape. 
</P>
<P>
For a backup, what about former Vice President Spiro Agnew? He could castigate 
the law system for bringing the poor sheriff to trial. Then there is Edwin 
Meese, who could give us a lecture on how not to remember anything while in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But let's don't forget Sam Pierce of HUD; he could discuss how to distribute 
funds to your buddies without your boss knowing for eight years. And last but 
not least, Adm. John Poindexter could explain to us how you talk to your boss 
everyday for approximately one hour and manage never to tell him what you are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
With these outstanding Republicans, the party would raise enough money to pay 
all the damages that the good sheriff has wrought upon us taxpayers, plus maybe 
take care of some of the overtime expenses the sheriff seems to have an 
excessive fondness for. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it could be a memorable evening in Orange County.

VOTE AGAINST PEOPLE'S INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Nov. 6, Californians were persuaded to vote against their own best interests 
by the "too big" and "too much money" complaints of the chemical, oil and 
timber industries. 
</P>
<P>
We lost the opportunity to show a watching America that we are very concerned 
about the use of chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects, and others 
destroying the ozone layer or contaminating our drinking water; that we are 
alarmed by our depleted forests and dwindling groves of ancient redwoods; that 
we want greater accountability from those responsible for oil spill disasters, 
and that we do care about the environment and the quality of our lives and 
those of our children. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, we seem to care about something "big" and "green" all right --

BENEFITS OF CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a student in the nursing program at Pierce College and my 3-year-old 
daughter is attending the Child Development Center at the college. I was 
shocked to hear that funding to the center will be cut shortly. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter has responded extremely well to the teaching methods at the center 
and is very happy. 
</P>
<P>
The center provides an invaluable, high-quality service to the community. It is 
critical that the college provide a good educational facility at a reasonable 
cost for the preschool children of students. 
</P>
<P>
These students have made a commitment to further education which is made more 
difficult having to care for children. The Child Development Center helps to 
ease this burden by contributing to the student's support system, thus helping 
to ensure that the student completes the prescribed studies. 
</P>
<P>
This not only benefits the student but also benefits society as a whole by 
having more educated people who can contribute to increasing society's standard 
of living. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate short-term costs saving of a cut in funding is far outweighed by 
the longer term cost to society of student dropouts.

WAS REPORT OF CRASH SEXIST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was angered and appalled at your paper's apparent sexism in reporting the 
Colorado light plane crash that took the lives of four Orange County residents 
(Nov. 13). 
</P>
<P>
While dutifully reporting the lives and careers of the three men killed in the 
crash, you gave scant information concerning Karolyn Barrett and made no 
mention whatsoever that she was a respected teacher at Hisamatsu Tamura 
Elementary School in Fountain Valley (a school you had featured and lauded in 
your previous Sunday's paper for high California Assessment Program scores). 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, you weren't alone in the media in your sexist reporting of this tragic 
story. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that you may respond that this was an innocent omission on your part 
and not sexism. However, why would your reporters not pursue career and 
biographical information on Mrs. Barrett just as they did on the three men?

MONEY NOT ENOUGH

<TEXT>
<P>
So Elizabeth Anne Broderick is accused of killing her ex-husband and his new 
"younger" wife. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind they "killed" Mrs. Broderick, legally, through a system controlled 
mostly by male lawmakers, attorneys and judges. 
</P>
<P>
Adultery is running rampant and acceptable. Women chase married men without a 
thought of the destruction looming for an entire family. 
</P>
<P>
Since a wife's consent is no longer needed for divorce, she is just pushed 
aside and is expected to peacefully endure the loss of the man she loves, a 
family, her friends, social contacts, the loss of her longtime marriage, safety 
and everything she worked toward during her entire marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Community property is 50-50 you say? Only if you can find it. Often husbands 
hide assets. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-husbands continue up the corporate ladder, their high earning power and 
pension intact, while women, out of the work world for many years, begin again 
at $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Mrs. Broderick's high spousal support, money doesn't "buy off" the 
destruction of a lifetime of dreams and the loneliness to come.

<P>
SMOG: IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, THE LOS ANGELES BASIN HAD THE CLEANEST AIR SINCE 
RECORDS WERE BEGUN IN 1955. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clean air is in the eyes -- or is it the lungs? -- of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials announced this month that during the six-month smog 
season that ended Nov. 1, the Los Angeles Basin had the cleanest air they have 
ever recorded. There were fewer smog alerts in 1990 than in any year since 
records for Southern California were first kept in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in the San Gabriel Valley say they can see and feel the 
improvement. But they also say the San Gabriel Valley is a long way from 
breathing clean, healthy air. And experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley still reports more smog alerts at its four air quality 
stations than any other part of the basin. That makes it the nation's smoggiest 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Also, while controls on auto and industrial emissions have helped clean the 
air, a significant part of the most recent improvement is believed to be caused 
by favorable weather conditions that may not last, said officials at the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers suggest that San Gabriel Valley residents continue to lose lung 
capacity from living in the ozone-laden air. And one city, Glendora, still has 
to bridle under its designation as "America's Smoggiest City." 
</P>
<P>
But first, the good news: 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley's four air monitors -- in Azusa, Glendora, Pasadena and 
Pomona -- reported a total of 60 smog alert days during the 1990 "smog season," 
compared to 94 in 1989. As recently as 1982, the four monitors recorded 170 
smog alert days. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials declare first-stage smog alerts when ozone, the area's 
principal pollutant, reaches 0.20 parts per million. Second-stage smog alerts 
are declared when ozone reaches 0.35 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1990 smog season -- for the fourth year in a row -- no second-stage 
alerts were declared in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials called the improvements "mind-boggling" and "dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley itself, most people judge the smog by looking toward 
the San Gabriel Mountains. And by this measure, as well, many have seen 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question I go out from my house more days and say, 'Aren't the 
mountains beautiful!' " Glendora Mayor Bob Kuhn said. "I used to go out and 
say, 'Where are the mountains?' " 
</P>
<P>
The improvement can also be seen on the pages of the Glendora Unified School 
District's "Smog Book." The district has an ozone meter and logs days on which 
schools are notified to curtail students' exercise. The book shows 43 such 
alerts in 1986, compared to nine in 1989 and just two this year. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say the air has improved substantially over the last decade, in 
large part because of greater controls on car exhausts and industrial 
emissions. "When you compare it with the past, it's like night and day," said 
Joe Cassmassi, senior meteorologist with the AQMD. "There's really been a 
dramatic improvement." 
</P>
<P>
In this year's improvement, favorable weather conditions also played an 
important part, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone forms in the air when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars 
and industry are exposed to sunlight. High pressure holds the pollution close 
to the ground and prevents it from blowing away. 
</P>
<P>
But more low-pressure systems penetrated the Los Angeles Basin in the last 
year, cleaning the air, said Joe Cassmassi, AQMD senior meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the days of improvement are based on weather conditions," Cassmassi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing the impact of weather against emission controls is difficult, he said. 
Researchers have estimated that this year, an average of four smog-alert days 
were eliminated at each smog station by pollution controls, and the rest by 
helpful weather, Cassmassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the elements will not always be so accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers added that although they are encouraged by the lower ozone levels, 
residents' health is still suffering because of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
There were still 180 days this year when ozone levels at least one reporting 
station in the Los Angeles area exceeded the state's more stringent clean air 
standard of 0.09 parts per million of ozone, the AQMD reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's good news that we have had fewer alerts and lower levels of 
pollution," said Roger Detels, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA's School of 
Public Health. "But we should continue to be concerned about levels of air 
pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Detels and a UCLA research group will soon publish the latest chapter in a 
study that has documented the decreased lung function of people who live in 
polluted areas. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers compared residents of Glendora and Long Beach with Lancaster, a 
control area with relatively cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people tend to have an increase in lung function until the age of about 
25," Detels said. "But in the polluted areas kids did not have as large an 
increase as in the control area. And after 25 years of age they had a greater 
decline in lung function." 
</P>
<P>
The findings support research at USC, which showed that second-graders in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District had 10% to 15% less lung capacity than a 
comparable group of children in Houston. And their lung capacity did not 
increase as much between the second and fifth grades as the Houston children's, 
said Kaye Kilburn, the USC professor of medicine who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
Another USC study showed notable lung abnormalities in 80% of 100 youths who 
died in homicides or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think essentially what we have accomplished is to stay in the same place 
over the last decade," Kilburn said. "We have absorbed more people and more 
automobiles and we have managed to not let the air pollution situation get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, there is a feeling of impotence in fighting the 
pollution that blows in from the west and settles against the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora has recorded the most smog alerts in the South Coast Air Basin, and 
thus the nation, every year since 1982. But city officials are quick to point 
out that they are bearing the brunt of a regionwide problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our smog," said Glendora Mayor Pro Tem Larry Glenn. "It blows in here 
and it has nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders have also been disgruntled about the location of a smog-monitoring 
station in their city. They say Glendora's air quality is no worse than in 
surrounding areas, but that the city's reputation has suffered because the 
Glendora station is near the base of the mountains, where air is the most 
stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials disagree that the Glendora station is unfairly located, saying 
the monitor on Leadora Avenue records about the same levels of ozone that have 
been recorded during spot checks in the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
But AQMD officials agreed that Glendora's air is not necessarily much worse 
than the rest of the San Gabriel Valley's. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa station, for example, reported fewer than half the smog alerts that 
Glendora did this year. But the Azusa monitor has more auto traffic nearby than 
Glendora's, so it registers higher levels of pollutants that come directly from 
car tailpipes, such as nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
These "primary" pollutants tend to force out ozone, which is the most prevalent 
and most often cited measure of pollution, said AQMD spokeswoman Claudia Keith. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora officials said most people do not pay attention to such subtle 
distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
The officials were so upset three years ago by the city's high pollution 
readings that they asked AQMD officials if they could move the smog station 
elsewhere, said City Manager Art Cook. The AQMD, however, said it needed the 
same station to consistently report air quality trends. 
</P>
<P>
"We more or less agreed they could keep it here," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
But boosters in a city that calls itself "The Pride of the Foothills" still 
don't like the bad publicity that comes with the high ozone readings.

NAZI SYMPATHIZERS' L.A. UTOPIA IS NOW A RUIN; 
</P>
<P>
RUSTIC CANYON: LITTLE REMAINS OF AN ELABORATE STRONGHOLD THAT WAS BUILT IN THE 
LATE 1930S. IT ONCE HAD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF A SMALL TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away up Rustic Canyon is a sordid bit of local history. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the rugged mountainsides and overgrown by brush, the burned-out 
and crumbling buildings are what remain of the Murphy Ranch, where during the 
late 1930s a small group hoping to establish a Nazi utopia built an elaborate 
infrastructure that included a 395,000-gallon concrete water tank, a 
20,000-gallon diesel fuel tank and a power station. 
</P>
<P>
Hikers who reach the site, usually by climbing the creek bed from Will Rogers 
State Historic Park, are sometimes surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't know the story come upon this and say, 'What the hell is 
going on?' " said Thomas Young, a professional photographer, local historian 
and president of the Palisades Historical Society. Young learned about the 
ranch while growing up in the Pacific Palisades area, and it was included in a 
book on the history of Rustic Canyon written by his mother, Betty Lou Young. 
Thomas Young took the photographs for the book, which was published in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The story, which Young admits is sketchy, centers on the owners of the Murphy 
Ranch, Winona and Norman Stephens, and a mysterious but persuasive German named 
Herr Schmidt. Although county records say a Jessie M. Murphy purchased the 
property in 1933, Young said there is no other record of her, and no one in the 
area ever saw her, leading him to suspect that Murphy was a front name. The 
name Murphy Ranch, however, stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Stephens was an engineer with silver mining interests in Colorado, and 
apparently financed the operation. His wife, the daughter of a wealthy 
industrialist, had a strong belief in metaphysical phenomena, and apparently 
fell under the spell of Schmidt, who claimed to have supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt convinced the Stephenses that once Europe collapsed and Germany emerged 
victorious in the war, anarchy would break out across the country, and law and 
order would break down. His plan was to create a command center in which the 
National Socialist community would wait out the war. They could then emerge 
from their mountain retreat and impose order on society. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently made sense to the Stephenses, for they proceeded to spend an 
estimated $4 million to build an infrastructure that would be enough for a 
small town. They also made plans to build a four-story mansion that were never 
carried out, probably because they ran out of money, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God they didn't have the assets to pull it off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What they did accomplish, however, is amazing. The entire hillside above the 
ranch was terraced, and a sprinkler system, complete with timers, was laid out 
to irrigate the numerous fruit, nut, carob and olive trees and other plants 
that covered it. Several concrete staircases ascend the hillside, which were 
either to allow for maintenance of the trees, or more likely, Young believes, 
to patrol the property. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did is they created a whole environment of their own," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The water tank and the power station, with its double generators, ensured that 
the community would be self-sufficient. The power station is the only structure 
basically intact, although the generators were removed and donated to Loyola 
Marymount University in the early 1970s. The inside walls are covered with 
graffiti, many of them typical of what one would find in an abandoned building, 
including, ironically, several swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of gangs and skinheads who come here," Young said. 
"Nuts are attracted to this place." 
</P>
<P>
The only other structure standing on the property is a two-story steel-frame 
building that was used as a garage and machine shed. It is now a rusted hulk, 
everything around and in it having burned in the 1978 Mandeville Canyon fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, they were here to stay. This was to be a real monument," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Workmen hired to build at the ranch were reportedly confused at the scale of 
what they were constructing, according to Young, who spoke to several of them 
years later. Even for an estate, the scale of the project and the extensive 
infrastructure made no sense to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They were setting up something beyond even what an extremely wealthy person 
could do," Young said, which makes him suspect that at least some of the 
funding for the project came from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Plans were drawn by architect Welton Becket in the late 1930s for a mansion, 
with barn, silo and cottages, for a client, "Mrs. Murphy." But these were 
apparently deemed insufficient, according to Young, and a new set of blueprints 
were drawn in 1941 by Paul Williams, the noted black architect. The client this 
time was Winona Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Young finds great irony in the selection of Williams as the designer. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'master race' couldn't get it together enough, so they had to go to a 
black architect. I think that's wonderfully poetic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nazi utopian community was never successfully formed, Schmidt did 
apparently have some followers. There were reports from neighbors of the ranch 
that paramilitary maneuvers took place during the weekends. Young believes that 
people would drive up to the ranch from the city to take part in the 
activities, and then drive back at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I think really that it was Joe Blow Loser coming up for a weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan came to a screeching halt on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor, when federal agents, who apparently had been watching the 
progress of the compound and its activities with some interest, stormed the 
ranch. They arrested Schmidt, whom they identified as a Nazi spy. The agents 
also found a powerful shortwave radio, reportedly for sending messages to 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt was apparently imprisoned, Young said, but nobody knows what happened 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
The Stephenses remained on the ranch, living in the upper floor of the steel 
garage structure until 1948, when they sold the ranch to the Huntington 
Hartford Foundation, which combined it with the property to the north and 
formed an artists' colony. 
</P>
<P>
John Vincent, a UCLA music professor who negotiated the sale of the property 
for the foundation and served as the foundation's director until the 1960s, 
provided Young with most of the details of the story of the Nazi compound. 
</P>
<P>
The property eventually came into the possession of the Los Angeles Department 
of Parks and Recreation, which wants to turn it over to the state as part of 
the Topanga State Park, said David Conetta, supervisor of land management and 
environment activities for the city agency. The state, however, will not accept 
the property unless the structures are demolished, a task the city lacks the 
money to do. So for now, the relics of the Murphy Ranch remain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Young admits that many of the details of the Nazi presence at the 
Murphy Ranch are untraceable, and some aspects of the story have taken on the 
characteristics of a legend, the one fact about which he feels most certain is 
that there was a Nazi encampment in Rustic Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a powerful presence here," he said. And then, looking around at the 
craggy hillsides that he has hiked and photographed since his youth, he 
concludes: 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a pretty place for such a stupid pursuit."

COACHED BY EXPERTS, A CAST OF CHILDREN FINDS THAT OPERA CAN BE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opera, generally thought of as the entertainment of the evening gown and tuxedo 
set, is coming to the Bart Simpson and L.A. Gear set. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of professionals from the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, 
grade-school students throughout the county are learning to slither like 
alligators, play the drums on trash-can contraptions and sing heartily in the 
chorus of a children's opera. 
</P>
<P>
After five weeks of training, they will unveil the opera, "A Muskrat Lullaby," 
on their school stage, sharing the spotlight with professional singers. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent dress rehearsal at Grand View Boulevard School in Mar Vista, the 
children, who play alligators and muskrats, went through the score and blocking 
-- their movements on stage -- in preparation for that afternoon's performance. 
Location director Paul King ordered the gators to stay low to the ground and 
act less polite and more "snarly." 
</P>
<P>
The opera involves about 120 youngsters in the fourth through sixth grades. 
</P>
<P>
Most had no idea what opera was. And if they did have an opinion about opera, 
teacher Brenda Richards said, it was that it was weird or boring. With the L.A. 
Music Center Opera team, a school production is not a casual undertaking. They 
conduct workshops in which the children sing scales, learn creative dramatics 
and acquire a basic music vocabulary. Llewellyn Crain, manager of the opera's 
education and community programs, and opera docents explain opera and teach 
lines and cues. Composer and librettist Edward Barnes and percussionist John 
Fitzgerald lead rehearsals and talk about their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the children play in a percussion band on instruments they built under 
Fitzgerald's guidance. Among the instruments are a drum made of three aluminum 
cans hanging inside a box, a "zipper guitar" made of a dowel and a metal spring 
strung between a garbage can and a coffee can, and glass canning jars filled 
with water and played with pencils that have new erasers. 
</P>
<P>
They are "junk instruments. . .," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing them, however, took practice, the youngsters said. "You have to keep 
track, look at the teacher. . ."and know the instrument, said aluminum can 
drummer Jason Clouse, 9. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unusual instruments, "Muskrat Lullaby" has elements of 
Charleston, salsa, rock 'n' roll and rap. "The style is . . . accessible and 
entertaining, more like Sondheim than like Puccini," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted kids to feel it was real hip, real cool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that the children don't exactly achieve bel canto. "We don't care how 
good they sound," Crain said. "Most important to us is that they understand 
this process" of creating an opera and they are coaxed "out of their shells or 
their everyday world." 
</P>
<P>
So it helps that "Muskrat Lullaby," based on the book "Mama Don't Allow" by 
Thacher Hurd, is set in a swamp. The plot is simple: A singing group consisting 
of Miles the Muskrat and three other animals (played by members of L.A. Opera's 
resident company) goes to the swamp to practice. They are nearly eaten by a 
gang of alligators, but they sing themselves to safety by crooning a lullaby 
and putting the gators to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The "Muskrat Lullaby" program, started in March, is the brainchild of general 
director Peter Hemmings, who ran a similar project when he led Scottish Opera. 
The program is financed by government agencies and private foundations and 
costs about $2,300 per school, with the school chipping in $800. By the end of 
this month, "Muskrat Lullaby" will have traveled to 29 schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The opera company is developing a similar program for junior high and high 
schools, Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
On performance day at Grand View, 11 people from the opera company took part, 
including the singers and technical crew. They brought costumes, a few props, 
conga drums, slide whistles and other instruments. The big star, from the 
children's standpoint, was bass-baritone Richard Bernstein, who played the role 
of the alligator boss, dressed in top hat, black coattails with green jewels 
and metallic green pants. 
</P>
<P>
The student alligators and muskrats seemed dazzled by the show even as they 
were in it. Accompanying composer Barnes on keyboards and Fitzgerald on drums, 
the sounds of the children's percussion band were amazingly melodic. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he was delighted at the way the youngsters shed their shyness as 
the 20-minute performance progressed. "They learn the value of being a ham on 
stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of about 200 students first whooped and giggled, but soon they 
were entranced. The alligators popped up out of character occasionally and the 
band missed a few beats, but they were given a chorus of bravos.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MICHIGAN HAS TO RALLY TO BEAT MINNESOTA, 35-18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some halftime tinkering helped Elvis Grbac crank up Michigan's passing game and 
the No. 16 Wolverines came from behind to beat Minnesota, 35-18, in a Big Ten 
game Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, 7-3 overall and 5-2 in the Big Ten, overcame a 10-7 halftime deficit 
with two touchdowns in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (5-5, 4-3) gave up two interceptions, both of which led to 
touchdowns, in the battle for the Little Brown Jug. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half we were flat and they showed us some things we weren't 
expecting," said Grbac, who had three touchdown passes. "We made adjustments at 
halftime and started to move the ball. We moved our formations around and that 
opened some passing lanes for us." 
</P>
<P>
Grbac, who completed 13 of 22 passes for 126 yards, threw a three-yard 
touchdown pass to Desmond Howard, an 11-yarder to Jarrod Bunch and a 
three-yarder to Derrick Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Ricky Powers, who gained 127 yards in 24 carries, had a five-yard 
touchdown run and Jon Vaughn a one-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive game in which Powers has rushed for more than 100 
yards and his third this season. Powers, who now has 508 yards rushing, is only 
the third true freshman ever to rush for 500 yards in his first season at 
Michigan. Rick Leach had 552 in 1975 and Jamie Morris 573 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Marquel Fleetwood scored on a five-yard run, Scott Schaffner threw a four-yard 
touchdown pass to Pat Tingelhoff and Brent Berglund kicked a 37-yard field goal 
for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Illinois 24, Indiana 10 -- Howard Griffith ran for 128 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Illini at Bloomington, Ind. His two touchdowns gave him 
31 for his Illinois career, which ties the school record set by Red Grange. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-yard run by Griffith late in the third quarter broke a 10-10 tie and put 
Illinois (7-3, 5-2) ahead for good. His one-yard run early in the fourth 
quarter capped a 96-yard drive after an Indiana fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably our best drive all year," Illinois Coach John Mackovic said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jason Verduzco, who passed 28 yards to Gus Palma for Illinois' 
first touchdown, threw for 236 yards and set up both of Griffith's touchdowns 
by completing all eight of his passes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is 5-4-1 and 2-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Michigan State 29, Northwestern 22 -- Hyland Hickson and Tico Duckett, 
Michigan State's 1-2 punch, came to the rescue when the bowl-bound Spartans 
played the stubborn Wildcats at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (6-3-1, 5-2), who are headed for the Hancock Bowl, trailed, 9-7, 
at the half and, 15-14, early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take them lightly, they just played hard," Coach George Perles said 
with a deep sigh of relief. "Give them credit. There's nothing for them at the 
end of the season but they played inspired football. Without Hickson and 
Duckett, we wouldn't have had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Hickson rushed 27 times for 184 yards and needs six against Wisconsin next week 
to reach 1,000. He also scored twice on one-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
Duckett, who has already surpassed 1,000 yards, gained 130 of his 137 yards in 
the second half and clinched the game with a 29-yard touchdown run with 3:41 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern is 2-8 and 1-6.

NO ROOM TO RUN, SO IOWA PASSES PURDUE;

HAWKEYES: RODGERS' FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES MAKE UP FOR POOR RUNNING GAME AS BIG

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Rodgers threw four touchdown passes to compensate for a lackluster rushing 
attack Saturday and lead No. 13 Iowa to a 38-9 Big Ten victory over Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, 8-2 overall and 6-1 in the Big Ten, retained its half-game conference 
lead going into the final game of the season against Minnesota. Purdue (2-8, 
1-6) hasn't won at Kinnick Stadium since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers held Iowa's usually potent rushing attack in check, especially 
when Nick Bell sat out the second half with an ankle injury. Bell, fifth in the 
conference with 819 yards, gained 32 yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes, third in the league in rushing with 245 yards a game, managed 
only 215, many in the last few series. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers completed 21 of 28 passes for 255 yards. Rodgers came into the game 
completing 61% percent of his passes and had nine touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
He put Iowa ahead, 7-0, in the first quarter with a seven-yard scoring pass to 
Tony Stewart. Purdue's Steve Wambold made it 7-3 in the second quarter with a 
39-yard field goal, but the Hawkeyes extended their lead to 14-3 when Rodgers 
connected with Danan Hughes on a scoring pass 4:13 before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' 30-yard touchdown throw to Mike Saunders capped a 78-yard drive to 
open the second half and gave the Hawkeyes a 21-3 margin. Jeff Skillett's 
21-yard field goal made it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' last scoring pass was a five-yarder to Robert Smith that gave Iowa a 
31-3 lead and followed a 47-yard punt return by Jeff Anttila, putting the the 
ball on the Purdue 23. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Lampkin scored on a 15-yard run for Iowa's final points. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue quarterback Eric Hunter, playing with his right knee heavily bandaged, 
scored on a seven-yard run around right end with 5:48 left that made it 31-9. 
Iowa blocked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter set two stadium records. His 32 completions broke by one the mark set by 
Tony Eason of Illinois in 1982, and his 60 attempts surpassed the 49 by Iowa's 
Gary Snook against Purdue in 1964.

IN THE ERA OF AIR, MICHAEL JORDAN IS AT PINNACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KAHN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SEATTLE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History has a way of labeling time periods. Art, architecture and politics 
figure into those studies of style. The effects are of global significance that 
ultimately transcend normal strains of time and talent. 
</P>
<P>
Coming down several thousand notches in global significance, you have sports. 
Basketball to be specific. Byzantine this is not. The Jordanian Era, this is. 
</P>
<P>
To underestimate Michael Jordan's skill level and effect on basketball would be 
akin to ignoring the impact of Monet's paintings on French impressionism or 
putting Frank Lloyd Wright's signature on the blueprints of a log cabin. 
</P>
<P>
The past decade, the lords of the NBA have been trying to find players to 
compare with Jordan, Magic Johnson or Larry Bird. It just doesn't work. So when 
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls play the Seattle SuperSonics on Saturday night in 
the Seattle Coliseum, don't expect him to do everything he wants to do. Just 
most things. 
</P>
<P>
Sonics coach K.C. Jones, one of the top defensive guards in the NBA 30 years 
ago, has seen the great ones. He defended Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. He 
has coached Dennis Johnson, practiced with Bob Cousy. All four are shorter, 
slower and have less jumping ability than the 6-foot-6 Jordan. And every year 
he pumps up another category, whether it's field-goal percentage, blocked shots 
or assists. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan? There's never been anyone else like him," Jones said. "He's like more 
than one player on the floor. He's a one and two guard at the same time. That's 
most unusual. He does both equally well. Oscar was close. Magic is close. West 
was just a two-guard. 
</P>
<P>
"And the most underrated thing he has is charisma on the floor. Every great 
thing he does lifts up the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
Then why hasn't he won any championships? Robertson, West, Cousy, and Dennis 
Johnson did. Magic Johnson might begin putting rings on his toes because he has 
run out of fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast seems rather elementary. It spells it all out, too. Jordan 
just can't do it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have mentioned to me that you really can't expect to have a 
leading scorer in the league on a championship team," Bulls coach Phil Jackson 
said. "That it just don't happen. When a team depends on one guy to score too 
much, and when the other team can shut that individual down, they win." 
</P>
<P>
Simple. Jordan has led the NBA in scoring the past four seasons, has averaged 
32.8 points a game for his career and, still, the Bulls are without a division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what Michael goes through," Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said. "You 
can't do it all by yourself every night and expect to win the championship. But 
we can't do everything on the floor and make the personnel moves too." 
</P>
<P>
But the Bulls are making progress, having taken the Detroit Pistons to seven 
games in the Eastern Conference final last season. Still, it is the drive to 
win that keeps Jordan going. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year, we've been getting closer and that's what keeps me positive," 
Jordan said. "We're bound to get there sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
The development of teammates Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant has been steady. 
But the big guys they need to produce -- Will Perdue and Stacey King -- have 
been tortoise-like in their development. B.J. Armstrong needs to take over as 
point guard, but isn't ready. Yugoslavian superstar Toni Kukoc, drafted by the 
Bulls this year in the second round, might be the answer to all their woes ... 
if he signs. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for us is to move the ball around, so we'll be a threat all 
over the court," Jackson said. "But when you've got a guy like Michael, you're 
still going to go to him at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The difference now is defenses have adjusted. Teams have picked up on trapping 
techniques on the wings and basically allow the other players open shots as 
opposed to permitting Jordan to touch the ball and ignite a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"No defense lets me get to the basket anymore," Jordan said. "Every defense 
makes me take the outside shot. Three or four years ago, no one was really sure 
if I could continue my pace of driving and going to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"But then Detroit started knocking me on my butt and everyone started to play 
that same kind of defense which doesn't allow me to get to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics have been one of the five NBA teams to prevent Jordan from averaging 
30 points a game. It might or might not work Saturday. It didn't last year 
because Pippen tore up the Sonics with unusually sharp perimeter shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are it will require more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 27, is counting on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams are going to come up and eliminate me as an important factor," Jordan 
said. "So we have to show we have other players who can step up and give us the 
contribution. Basically, we have what I would call an equal-opportunity offense 
that everybody's going to get a chance to score." 
</P>
<P>
Which is fine, as long as they win. If not, the Jordanian Era will end without 
any Jordanian rings. Long live the legend.

MOON NEEDED ONLY ONE SECOND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boy stood handcuffed near the checkout counter, held by a security guard 
and watched carefully by the store manager. 
</P>
<P>
The entire future of 14-year-old Warren Moon revolved around a stolen 99-cent 
headband. 
</P>
<P>
Or so he felt at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most embarrassing moment of my life," the Houston Oilers 
quarterback said. "I was standing in the middle of the store and everyone had a 
chance to see me. I felt as low as I could possibly feel. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my mom came to pick me up and the look in her eyes, I could see the hurt 
and I knew I'd really screwed up and hurt her bad." 
</P>
<P>
Moon went into the store with two friends to buy ice cream and as they wandered 
through the aisles Moon's companions each grabbed a headband and stuffed it in 
their pants. 
</P>
<P>
"Being along and being stupid, I did the same thing," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon got his ice cream and a candy bar and went to the front of the store. But 
a loudspeaker alerted the security guard to "stop those three boys at the 
counter." The other two boys ran. Moon was sacked and searched. 
</P>
<P>
"They searched me and found the headband," Moon said. "I had $3 in my pocket 
and could have paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
In his worst moment, Moon got a break. 
</P>
<P>
"The store manager thought he'd taught me a lesson and didn't press charges," 
Moon said. "He gave me a second chance and my Mom stressed that I was getting a 
second chance and not to blow it. From that day forward, I never did anything 
like that again." 
</P>
<P>
Moon has made the most of his second chances since that day at the neighborhood 
store. 
</P>
<P>
He's also given plenty of second chances through his Cresent Moon charitable 
foundation, helping steer others away from the temptations of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to kind of take that extra step at every level just to show what I 
can do whether it be junior college or Canada before I got a chance to play in 
the NFL," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
Second chances. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was an all-city performer at Los Angeles Hamilton High and attended West 
Los Angeles Junior College to get a second chance to play big time college 
football at the University of Washington, where he was the 1978 most valuable 
player in the Rose Bowl and PAC-8 player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He played six seasons in the Canadian Football League after college before he 
got a second chance to play for the Houston Oilers, where this season he became 
the only pro quarterback to pass for 20,000 yards in both the Canadian Football 
League and the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told all my life that I couldn't play this position, that I didn't 
have what it took," Moon said. "There were people on the other side saying that 
I could but it was the people who told me I couldn't that kept me going. I have 
a lot of confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Moon's lack of acceptance as a quarterback centered around being black. 
Moon is proud of the part he's played, along with Philadelphia's Randall 
Cunningham and former Washington quarterback Doug Williams, in clearing the way 
for future NFL black quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Moon rates among the best of all NFL quarterbacks. He is second in 
the AFC and fifth overall with an 89.3 rating. Although he has been intercepted 
11 times -- only Boomer Esiason has thrown more among conference passers -- he 
also has thrown for 19 touchdowns, second only to Joe Montana. And his 2,830 
yards trails only Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Moon became a close friend last year with Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, now 
a rookie with the Detroit Lions. He rented a freeway billboard to congratulate 
the University of Houston star on his award. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug's achievements helped more than anybody else's because he got to the 
highest point of the pedestal," Moon said. "That put him in a class with the 
great ones and turned a lot of heads as far as some of the stereotypes and 
stigmas that were placed on black quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
The only stereotype Oilers offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride sees in Moon is 
that he is the perfect stereotype of a run-and-shoot quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"You pretty much describe Warren when you talk about the qualities you look for 
in a run-and-shoot quarterback," Gilbride said. "He's done a great job of 
putting us where we need to be. All we need are a few more Ws." 
</P>
<P>
The focus in the run-and-shoot is the quarterback, Gilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you run an I-formation, you'd better have a great tailback otherwise you're 
kidding yourself," Gilbride said. "If you're in the run-and-shoot, it's 
critical that the guy playing quarterback is of the same vintage. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask him to throw 40 to 60 passes a game and he's not performing very 
well, you don't have much offense." 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Ernest Givins is convinced Moon is the man and the run-and-shoot 
is the offense to lead the Oilers to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't ask for an better offense that fits the style of Warren," Givins 
said. "He rolls out better than anybody, he throws on the move better than 
anybody I've ever seen or throws back across the field. It just fits him." 
</P>
<P>
Moon is one of the wealthiest players in the game, he's at the top of his 
profession with the respect of his peers. All that remains is "the big one," 
getting to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I never look at it in terms that I'll never do it," Moon said. "It's something 
I want and it's something that burns inside me." 
</P>
<P>
He also realizes that at 33 he may be running out of second chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a lot of time left to do it, maybe two or three more years," Moon 
said. "This team is at the stage where in the next two years there's going to 
be major changes and start the wheel all over. I don't have time to go through 
a rebuilding situation." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Moon reaches the Super Bowl or not, he's already a hero to both young 
and old through his Cresent Moon Foundation. He was named the NFL Man of the 
Year for 1990 because of the varied programs his organization funds. 
</P>
<P>
Moon has special motivation for helping. He grew up with six sisters, a mother 
and no father. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for some of the organizations 
that I was involved with as a kid," Moon said. "It's not just the organizations 
but the people who took the time because they realized I didn't have a Dad 
around the house." 
</P>
<P>
Moon was seven when his father died needing a liver transplant that never came. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a strong mom who played both roles but I also had a lot of those people 
around that kept me focused," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's support group includes a kindly store manager who must now wish he'd 
gotten an autograph on the contraband headband.

NOTRE DAME'S ISMAIL HEADS HEISMAN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PRESTON, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whoosh!!! Hey, was that The Rocket running away with the Heisman Trophy? 
</P>
<P>
With slightly more than two weeks left before the announcement, Notre Dame's 
all-purpose player Raghib "Rocket" Ismail seems to be the front-running 
candidate for college football's big award. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't this all sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
Ismail starts out deep behind Brigham Young quarterback Ty Detmer and 
Michigan's Jon Vaughn, then runs into a pile of others, including running backs 
Eric Bieniemy of Colorado and Darren Lewis of Texas A&amp;M, then out-legs 
quarterbacks Shawn Moore of Virginia and David Klingler of Houston down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his to win," Mike Francesa, a CBS college football analyst, said. "He has 
two more games left, both on national television, and if he plays like he has 
thus far, it's a lock." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. How can a 5-foot-10, part-time wide receiver, part-time running 
back and full-time specialist win the Heisman with only six total touchdowns? 
The national television exposure most of the season certainly helped, but one 
doesn't win a Heisman on prime time alone. Ismail has handled the ball on 101 
plays, gaining 1,421 yards. His statistics are comparable to former Notre Dame 
star Tim Brown's. Brown handled the ball 111 times for 1,640 yards and seven 
touchdowns in his 1987 Heisman season. 
</P>
<P>
"Explosive, the ability to dominate or turn around a game so quickly," ABC 
commentator Dick Vermeil said about Ismail. "No player has such an impact. 
Personally, I would pick Shawn Moore, but, at this particular time, Ismail has 
to be the favorite and picking up steam." 
</P>
<P>
"He gives his team good field position without even touching the ball, because 
other teams kick away from him," Francesa said. "His ability to turn a game 
around in one play is not matched in college football." 
</P>
<P>
There are others, though, who say Moore was the most valuable player of any top 
10 team. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 6-foot-2, 213 pounds, runs the option, has a decent arm and operates an 
offense that averages 44.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Moore is a Tony Rice with an arm," Ivan Maisel of The Dallas Morning News 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the overall picture, no one has done and meant more to their 
team than Shawn Moore," ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr said. "If you took the Rocket 
or Jon Vaughn away from their respective teams, they would still have good 
teams. But if you took Shawn Moore away from Virginia, they would be average." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's chances for the Heisman, though, faded Nov. 3, when the then-No. 1 and 
unbeaten Cavaliers lost to Georgia Tech, 41-38, on national television. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Virginia had to go undefeated for him to win it," Francesa said. 
"Even though Virginia scored 41 points that day, and it wasn't his fault they 
lost, it put him behind Ismail." 
</P>
<P>
Moore has company in others who have taken a Heisman slide in one game. Brigham 
Young quarterback Ty Detmer may have lost his Heisman to a bunch of attacking 
Ducks, as in Oregon, which beat Brigham Young, 32-16. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer completed 33 of 57 passes for 442 yards against Oregon, but five of his 
passes were intercepted. He failed to revive the magic of three weeks before in 
a near-perfect, gutty performance and a 28-21 victory over then-top-ranked 
Miami, which made him the leading candidate for the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
"Who can vote for a guy who loses to a team called the Ducks?" one Heisman 
voter said. 
</P>
<P>
"He may have played his best game too early, and the school doesn't get a whole 
lot of exposure," Kiper said. "You know, it's one of those out-of-mind, 
out-of-voting things. Plus, their schedule just wasn't that tough." 
</P>
<P>
Miami quarterback Craig Erickson lost his luster in the race because the 
Hurricanes committed a cardinal sin this season. Miami lost two games. Goodbye, 
Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler, 6-3, 205, had an outside chance until Saturday night, when the 
Cougars (8-1) lost to Texas, 45-24, as Klingler completed only 22 of 52 passes 
for 299 yards and was intercepted four times. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler also has the odds against him. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Ware, the 1989 Heisman winner and former Houston quarterback, produced a 
number of 400-yard games last season, and such games no longer are a big deal 
in Houston's run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
And and only two schools, Yale (Larry Kelley and Clint Frank in 1936 and 1937) 
and Army (Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis in1945-46) turned out different Heisman 
winners in consecutive seasons. Ohio State also produced a Heisman winner two 
straight years, but he was the same player -- Archie Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tough time believing anybody judges a player on one game," said 
Detmer, 6-0, 175, referring to him and Klingler. "I'm not going to worry about 
it, because we're here to play for a whole season. And if by the end, I win the 
Heisman, that's fine. If not, well, that's fine, too." 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy, 5-6, 195, seems to be the top running back, but his troubles earlier 
in the season may cost him a few votes. Bieniemy was charged with interfering 
with firefighters while they tried to put out a fire at his parents' home. He 
was suspended for the team's season opener against Tennessee. In 1988, Bieniemy 
received a deferred sentence after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge 
of disorderly conduct stemming from a bar fight 
</P>
<P>
"I think people will still remember," Kiper said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an exciting back, but if you give (the Heisman) to Bieniemy, then you 
should have given it to (Washington State running back Steve) Broussard last 
year," said Joel Buchsbaum, draft analyst and associate editor of Pro Football 
Weekly. "Bieniemy is exciting, but I don't know if he's a great back." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn, 5-11, 200, started off the year well, averaging 244.5 yards, but has 
been only average the rest of the way, and Lewis, 6-0, 220, may have become a 
candidate too late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," Francesa said. "Moore loses the big game. Klingler and 
Detmer have similar stats which cancel each other. There are no super running 
backs, so that just leaves the Rocket, who is clearly above and ahead of the 
rest of the field."

OREGON WINS BATTLE OF FIELD GOALS

Gregg McCallum kicked two field goals and the Oregon defense made repeated big 
plays in the final quarter as the heavily favored Ducks struggled to a 6-3 
victory over Oregon State Saturday in the annual Civil War football game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon, whose offense sputtered in the absence of quarterback Bill Musgrave, 
finished the regular season at 4-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference and 8-3 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks' defense held Oregon State to 27 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks, who are headed for the Freedom Bowl, won eight games in the regular 
season for the first time since 1959. But the last one was anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers, whose 1-10 record was their worst since 1981, were 20 1/2-point 
underdogs. But they were tied 3-3 at halftime and missed two serious scoring 
threats in the second half. Oregon State was 1-6 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Bob Brothers took over for Musgrave at quarterback for Oregon.

ON ROAD, OLD BULLETS WERE ALL-TIME DUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They played their home games in an old roller-skating rink, on a floor of 
unvarnished wood. They changed their team colors three times during the 1953-54 
National Basketball Association season. They were a quarrelsome lot, their 
locker room split into factions. Their coach allegedly drank. Sometimes, 
particularly on the road, he didn't even show up for games. 
</P>
<P>
They were the Baltimore Bullets and they folded on Thanksgiving in 1954, but 
not before setting a league record by losing 32 straight games in opponents' 
gyms, a streak encompassing part of one season and all of another. They are 
back in the news these days because the New Jersey Nets have lost 31 in a row 
on the road, threatening the record, one of the NBA's oldest. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had a whole different set of problems than the Nets do now," Paul 
Hoffman was saying at his house in Glenarm, Md. An All-American at Purdue in 
the 1940s, he was one of the Bullets' best players in those years, and the only 
one who still lives in the area. Now 64, he works as a therapist at the 
Maryland Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
He paints an unseemly portrait of his Bullets. The NBA was still a fledgling 
operation then, low-paying and largely ignored, and the Bullets were 
particularly flimsy. Their coach and general manager was Clair Bee, one of the 
game's legends, a Hall of Famer who coached championship teams at Long Island 
University. He was out of his element in the NBA, though, and near the end of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Clair was anything but stable," Hoffman said. "He was drinking heavily. It's 
sad. He's a legend, but to us he was anything but a coach. I've never really 
said anything about it publicly. But he didn't coach, didn't manage, wasn't 
around the club at all. We were on our own, and we just got our butts beat." 
</P>
<P>
They were not completely without talent. Their best player, a big man named Ray 
Felix, scored almost 7,000 points in his pro career. Hoffman was among the 
league leaders in assists. Bob Houbregs, a forward, had been an All-American at 
Washington. The Bullets won almost 40 percent of their home games during the 
two seasons in which they built the losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
They still were the worst team in the league, though, and it started at the 
top. Instead of paying for a training camp before the 1954-55 season, Bee took 
the team to Japan on a USO-sponsored trip. He was often absent without 
explanation, and the team came back unprepared for the season. It was just as 
hard in those days to win on the road. The disorganized Bullets were an easy 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Clair's secretary would call me before a trip to tell me he would meet us on 
the road," Hoffman said. "I'd go by the office and get the plane tickets, and 
I'd take the club on the road. We'd go for three or four games, and maybe for 
the first three he wouldn't show up. I coached the team. We'd just get waxed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any cohesion at all. Bee had brought in three of his players 
from LIU. Al Roges, Rollie Hans and Hal Uplinger. They didn't have any damn 
business being in the league. They caused problems on the floor and off. If 
they wanted something, or if there was a dispute, they'd go to Clair and he'd 
listen to them. We had a lot of dissension." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the road losses mounted. (The streak did not include games played at 
neutral sites, of which there were many in those days.) The Bullets' last road 
victory came on Jan. 1, 1953, an 83-81 defeat of the Milwaukee Hawks, in 
overtime. They lost the rest of their road games that season, and every one in 
the 1953-54 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Toward the end of that year, we lost two in one night in Milwaukee," Hoffman 
said. "They'd gotten fogged out trying to come here for a game, and Clair said 
we'd just make it up the next time we went out there. Played a doubleheader. 
Lost both by almost the same damn score (65-54 and 64-54). We were tired. You 
try playing a doubleheader." 
</P>
<P>
By that point in the season, Bee had changed the team's uniforms three times. 
"We'd always used navy blue and mustard yellow on the road," Hoffman said, "but 
Bee didn't like that, so he went and bought us solid black road uniforms. But 
we lost so much he said, 'Shoot, you look worse in black than yellow and blue,' 
and went and bought cardinal red." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the color they wore, the Bullets would go into Minneapolis and 
lose to the Lakers and George Mikan, the NBA's elite in those days. They would 
lose in Boston to Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman and the Celtics; in Syracuse to Dolph 
Schayes and the Nationals; in Philadelphia to Neil Johnston and the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-team NBA was just beginning to gain fans and compete with the popular 
college game, and teams were beginning to think about moving into larger 
arenas. The Bullets had no chance. They played their home games at the 
Baltimore Coliseum, a little building with 3,900 seats in it. Tickets cost $2, 
and crowds were skimpy. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have roller skating one night and we'd play the next," Hoffman said. 
"The floor was just raw wood, no shellac on it. No one came to see us. We 
always looked like we were getting ready to disband." 
</P>
<P>
They finally did after playing 14 games in the 1954-55 season. They lost their 
first two road games that year, stretching their streak to 34 in a row, then 
broke it by beating the Knicks in New York. But all their games that season 
were wiped from the books when the team disbanded. The players learned they 
were folding after a 92-89 loss in Fort Wayne, Ind., to the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have enough money to get back to Baltimore," Hoffman said. "We'd run 
out of meal money, expense money, didn't even have enough to pay for the hotel. 
The hotel manager called and said, 'Don't leave until you pay.' I called the 
airport and told them to hold the plane, and we hired a limo that came around 
to the back of the hotel. We slid the bags out, jumped in and took off. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane was waiting for us when we got to the airport. We went through a 
side gate of the terminal, took the baggage right onto the plane, and they 
closed the door and took off. We made it back and I never paid for the limo or 
the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets' best players were picked up by other teams. One from the 1953-54 
season, James Luisi, got into acting and years later wound up playing James 
Garner's lieutenant on "The Rockford Files." Another, Hal Uplinger, got into 
television production and helped pioneer the use of instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman retired after the season -- "there was no money in it" -- and went back 
to Purdue, where he replaced a fraternity brother named Hank Stram as the 
baseball coach and assistant basketball coach. He came back to Baltimore and 
was the Bullets' general manager when they returned in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
He never again ran into Clair Bee. The life of the famous coach, who invented 
the 1-3-1 defense and later wrote a series of children's sports books, was at a 
low ebb during his years in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed away from him after that," Hoffman said. "I wasn't very happy with 
the way things turned out. It hurt my pro career. We just weren't a very good 
team. We lost a lot of games. But we never had much of a chance."

FULLERTON HITS BOTTOM AGAINST NEW MEXICO ST.; 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEST: TITANS ARE ROUTED, 43-9, BY AGGIES, WHO END THEIR 27-GAME LOSING 
STREAK.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton hit ground zero Saturday, losing to New Mexico State, 43-9, 
and snatching the title of "Worst Division I-A Team in America" from the 
Aggies' mantel. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State was ranked 106th out of 106 Division I-A teams by The 
National, an all-sports publication. The Aggies surely will vacate the bottom 
spot, and Fullerton, which entered at No. 105, has the U-Haul in the driveway 
and is ready to move in. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about as low as it gets," Titan defensive back Terry Tramble said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin: "It's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 19,227 in Aggie Memorial Stadium saw New Mexico State (1-10) score 
24 fourth-quarter points to break open a 19-9 game. Aggie quarterback David 
Chisum, a former Sunny Hills High and Fullerton College standout, completed his 
first 11 passes en route to a 19-for-31, 288-yard, two-touchdown performance. 
</P>
<P>
That helped New Mexico State snap a 27-game losing streak, which dated back to 
Oct. 1, 1988. It was the Aggies' first victory at home since Oct. 24, 1987, and 
their first Big West Conference victory since they beat Fullerton in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the second game of the 1983 season, when New Mexico 
State beat Louisiana Tech, 15-7, that the Aggies held an opponent under 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State entered with the nation's longest current Division I-A losing 
streak. The Titans, who have lost 11 in a row since a season-opening victory 
over Sonoma State, left with longest current Division I-A losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about it," Titan Coach Gene Murphy said. "I'm a competitive son 
of a . . . and as long as you're a player or coach, this better eat you up 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
First-year New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess may have felt more relieved than 
elated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous burden every time we read in the paper that we had the 
longest losing streak," Hess said. "It feels very good to pass that on to 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
After beating Fullerton in 1986, then-New Mexico State Coach Mike Knoll led the 
Aggies on a victory lap around the stadium. But that was tame compared to 
Saturday's postgame celebration. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State fans tore down both goal posts and carried them around the 
field. The Aggies' victory bell, which had been collecting dust for two years, 
rang loud and long afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't the only strange occurences in Aggie Memorial Stadium, though. In 
what had to be an unofficial school record, New Mexico State was penalized 
twice, for excessive celebrations in the end zone after fourth-quarter 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
And the Aggies' defense, which had six sacks in 10 previous games, made four 
appearances in the Titans' backfield, sacking Paul Schulte four times for a 
loss of 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State rolled up 514 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between being last in your conference and last in the 
country," said Fullerton offensive lineman Mike Simmons. "But that's the title 
we hold. It hurts, and it's a tough thing to deal with, but sometimes things 
happen like that."

His first season at Cal State Long Beach a success, Coach George Allen saluted 
a cheering crowd amid a swirl of confetti Saturday afternoon after the 49ers 
had defeated Nevada Las Vegas, 29-20, before 4,649 in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first winning season since 1986 for Long Beach, which finished 6-5 
overall and 4-3 in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 72, who last had a losing record in 1954 when he was at Whittier 
College, has now had 17 consecutive winning seasons as a head coach -- two with 
Whittier, five with the Rams, seven with the Washington Redskins, one each with 
USFL teams Chicago and Arizona, where he last coached in 1984, and one with 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There will never be another football season like this one," said Allen, whose 
team got off to an 0-3 start, including a 59-0 loss at Clemson in the opener. 
"In my whole coaching career, this is my most rewarding experience. We stuck 
together, worked hard and never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had to come from behind after Las Vegas (4-7, 3-4) had taken a 14-9 
lead on a 70-yard drive that ended with a five-yard touchdown run by Derek 
Black with 1:11 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
With nine seconds left in the half, 49er quarterback Todd Studer, with a 
defender grabbing his legs, threw a 23-yard scoring pass to tight end Joel 
Glick that gave Long Beach the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-yard field goal by Sean Cheevers extended the lead to 19-14, then Studer 
threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Exum on the first play of the fourth 
quarter. Cheevers made it 29-14 when he kicked a 39-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach defense, playing one of its best games, held the Rebels 
scoreless in the second half until Derek Stott hit Keenan McCardell with a 
nine-yard touchdown pass with 2:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
Studer completed 17 of 35 passes for 207 yards, but it was the 49ers' running 
that wore down Las Vegas. Of their 231 yards on the ground, Rickey Clark had 87 
yards and Herman Nash had 54. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who had lost four games in a row to Las Vegas, finished 6-0 at home 
for the first time.

FRESNO STATE BOWLED OVER BY SAN JOSE, 42-7; 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEST: SPARTANS TURN FOUR TURNOVERS INTO SCORES TO EARN CONFERENCE TITLE AND 
BERTH IN CALIFORNIA RAISIN BOWL.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When San Jose State went on the defensive, it had a profound effect on the 
Spartans' offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans converted three turnovers into touchdowns in the final 1:27 of the 
second quarter and San Jose broke away for a 42-7 victory over Fresno State 
Saturday to win the Big West Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense has gotten points in spurts all season, and much of the time it's 
been our defense that turned on the offense," said Terry Shea, who became San 
Jose's coach when Claude Gilbert was fired last spring. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the Big West title, San Jose State, 8-2-1 overall and 8-0 in the 
conference, earned a berth in the California Raisin Bowl on Dec. 8 at Fresno 
against Central Michigan, co-champion of the Mid-American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (8-2-1, 5-1-1) won the Big West title and the California Raisin 
Bowl titles the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Franklin started the Spartans' surge by intercepting Mark Barsotti's pass 
and returning it 52 yards to set up Leon Hawthorne's 10-yard touchdown run that 
broke a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
On the next series, Franklin intercepted another pass from Barsotti and 
returned in 24 yards for a touchdown to make it 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
Following the ensuing kickoff, San Jose's Anthony Washington recovered a fumble 
by Lorenzo Neal at the Fresno 33, setting up Hawthorne's three-yard touchdown 
run with two seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"The second quarter really shifted things in our favor," Shea said, "but the 
second quarter has been one of our most productive all season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the team we had to keep it going in the third quarter because (Fresno) 
had been really tough (in the third quarter all season) and we hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose had outscored opponents, 132-24, in the second quarter before 
Saturday, but in the third, they were outscored, 45-35. 
</P>
<P>
Shea was concerned because Fresno had outscored opponents, 91-37, in the third 
quarter, but he shouldn't have worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third quarter, the Spartans' Simon Vaoifi recovered Aaron Craver's 
fumble at the Bulldog six, and San Jose's Sheldon Canley, who rushed for 109 
yards, scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Bobby Blackmon ran 13 yards for a touchdown as San Jose to 
made it 42-7 with 5:29 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, San Jose State was a much better football team than they had been 
against all the others," Fresno Coach Jim Sweeney said. "They operated at high 
performance in all phases of the game. We just didn't respond today. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there was something I could do to get San Jose State ranked in the top 
20 because they deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State scored first on Barsotti's three-yard pass to Craver in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans got even later in the quarter on Ralph Martini's 23-yard pass to 
Gary Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense made this happen," Hawthorne said. "The turning point was when 
Franklin got those interceptions. I have to give all the credit to our 
defense."

NHL ROUNDUP;

CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS KEEP ON ROLLING

<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as last season, the Norris Division was considered the weakest 
division in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer true. In fact, two of the teams, Chicago and St. Louis, 
apparently are as good as any. Both are on winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thomas had a hat trick in the second period at Quebec Saturday night and 
the Blackhawks, leading the division, handed the Nordiques their 13th 
consecutive defeat, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago is on a 5-0-2 surge and leads the Blues, who have won six in a row, by 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks had a 1-0 lead before Thomas broke the game open with his three 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- A brilliant performance by goalie Curtis Joseph at 
Bloomington, Minn., compensated for the failure of Brett Hull to get a point. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, who has 19 goals, had an 11-game scoring streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph stopped 34 shots and the Blues had goals from Paul Cavallini and Bob 
Bassen less than two minutes apart in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Washington 2 -- Doug Crossman and Kevin Dineen scored 25 seconds 
apart in the first period at Hartford, Conn., to lead the Whalers to their 
fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the Capitals were flying high, but now they have lost five in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 1, Montreal 1 -- After being blanked by Andy Moog for 105 minutes this 
season, the Canadiens finally solved him and earned a tie at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Pederson's goal got Montreal even at 5:27 of the third period after John 
Carter scored for the Bruins in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Although Flyer goalie Pete Peeters protested, 
referee Kerry Fraser ruled that Bruce Driver's shot on a power play crossed the 
goal line for the winning score in the third period at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Toronto 4 -- Steve Yzerman had a hat trick in the first 12 minutes 
at Toronto, then assisted on two other goals to lead the Red Wings' romp. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Calgary 3 -- Mikko Makela scored with a little more than five 
minutes left in regulation at Calgary to get the Sabres the tie. DAN HAFNER

ARELLANO HELPS BELMONT SWEEP CITY CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprising victory by Belmont High's Rene Arellano in the City cross-country 
championships Saturday at Pierce College led to a not-too-surprising outcome in 
the race for the team title. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano won the three-mile race in 14 minutes 58 seconds, and Belmont placed 
five runners among the top 12 to easily win its eighth boys' team championship 
in the past nine seasons with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Woodland Hills Taft, which snapped Belmont's string of seven 
titles last season, was second with 115. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont also won its second consecutive girls' title, placing four runners 
among the top eight to win with 19 points. San Pedro was a distant second with 
108. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont became the first school to win girls' and boys' City titles in the same 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The top two teams qualified for the state meet next Saturday at Woodward Park 
in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
University's Robin Snowbeck powered past Granada Hills Kennedy's Jennie Armenta 
on the final downhill stretch of the race to win the girls' race in 18:40. 
Armenta was second in 18:47. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Section finals at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, the 
Newhall Hart boys' and Agoura girls' teams maintained their top rankings in the 
section by winning titles. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Keith Grossman finished seventh in 16 minutes to lead Hart to an 
89-95 victory over Saddleback in the boys' Division I race. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's Deena Drossin recorded the fastest time of the day -- a 17:23 mark -- 
in leading the Chargers to their fourth consecutive team title, 47-94, over 
Arroyo Grande in Division I. Three-time defending state Division I champion 
Palos Verdes finished third with 106 points. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Grande senior Louie Quintana clocked 14:43 in winning the boys' Division 
I title ahead of Canyon Country Canyon's Dave Hartman (15:07). 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's boys' team edged Marmonte League rival Camarillo, 77-83, for the 
Division II championship and Westlake's girls totaled 72 points in winning the 
girls' Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
The top four teams in each division qualified for state.

Leuzinger High of Lawndale rallied to score 14 unanswered points in the second

</P>
<P>
Crespi (8-3), which had outscored its opponents, 93-22, in the second half 
before being shut out by the Olympians, led 10-0 in the first quarter and 16-7 
at halftime.

PEOPLE: CHAPLAIN OF BELL SHELTER FOR HOMELESS OFFERS JOB HELP ALONG WITH HIS 
SERMONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Thursday night, the Rev. Bill Shaw preaches an old-fashioned, 
Bible-thumping sermon to the men and women at the Salvation Army homeless 
shelter in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a requirement, but most of the homeless at the 200-bed shelter attend 
the services out of respect for Shaw, according to shelter administrators and 
homeless people whose lives the Southern Baptist preacher has touched. 
</P>
<P>
"He cares for people and he works well with them," said Salvation Army Capt. 
Scott Ramsey, commander and administrator of the Bell shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey said Shaw has made a positive impact in the eight months that he has 
been chaplain and coordinator of programs at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw not only prays for the homeless, but he takes practical steps to try to 
help them improve their lives, said Reginald Gilbert, a homeless man who has 
been coming to the shelter for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said Shaw helped him receive training that led to a job as a 
check-processing clerk at the Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
Gilbert, 30, continues to sleep at the shelter while he saves enough money to 
rent an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw selected Gilbert and seven other homeless people to attend a four-month 
course at the Banking Institute, a private vocational school in Los Angeles 
that provides training to disadvantaged students for jobs in the banking 
industry. Tuitions were paid with federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the homeless participants dropped out, but Gilbert, John Wade and 
Charles Tennant recently graduated from the vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
Wade and Tennant are also living at the shelter while they search for work. 
They are currently being interviewed by various banks. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said Shaw "takes money from his own pocket to help us. He will give us 
money for things like lunch." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sending the students to the vocational school, Shaw tries to 
help find jobs for the homeless through the state Employment Development 
Department. At the end of his sermons, Shaw asks if anyone is interested in a 
specific job being offered through the employment department. He said he 
generally refers three or four people to contacts he has made through the 
employment department. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking his present job, Shaw had been a traveling evangelist. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about the job as soon as I came to Los Angeles more than eight months 
ago. Capt. Ramsey interviewed me and I got the job," said Shaw, 40, who had 
been living in Dallas. He now lives in Los Angeles with his son Ashley, 13. His 
wife, Nancy, and daughter, Audra, 15, are still in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he shared some of the same misconceptions others have about the 
homeless, believing "they are lazy and don't want to work." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has found many homeless people "do want to succeed but for various 
reasons have fallen on bad times. All they need is some help and they respond." 
</P>
<P>
As a tribute to Shaw, more than 100 of the homeless signed a letter recently 
that expressed their appreciation for the preacher. The letter was sent to 
Shaw's superiors at the Salvation Army. A copy was also sent to President Bush. 
</P>

Cal State Long Beach English professor Robert Bell has been granted knighthood 
in the Sovereign and Military Order of the Knights of Templar of Jerusalem of 
Edinburgh, Scotland. The order of knights was organized during the Christian 
Crusades in 1118 in an attempt to recover the Holy Land from the Moslems. The 
group is involved in charitable causes today. 
</P>
<P>
A scholar of the Middle Ages, Bell was one of 25 people from around the world 
to be honored during a ceremony in Edinburgh. Bell said the order was aware of 
his studies of the history of the Knights Templar and asked him to join. 
</P>
<P>
"The honor doesn't come with any land, but I get to call myself 'Sir,' " said 
Bell, who has taught at the university for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bell also received the order's white cape and golden cross necklace.

BEST BETS

Have you ever looked at a work of art and wondered what was going through the 
artist's mind when he created it? The works of Jorge Santos will keep you busy 
for a week. "Unknown Realities," his latest display, is featured at MRL Fine 
Art in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although he focused primarily on pencil drawings, Santos has recently begun to 
paint with oils and has made significant accomplishments in the field of 
lithography. His works are said to be very powerful and complex . . . 
comparable to the moods of Salvador Dali and M.C. Escher. Santos is bringing 
surrealism to life in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Santos was born in Lunada, Angola, in 1959. He was forced to leave Africa in 
1975 and fled to Lisbon, Portugal, to avoid violence in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It was through his passion for drawing that Santos dealt with the emotions 
stirred by the change. He traveled throughout Europe and northern Africa and 
returned to Portugal in 1979. Santos later settled in Los Angeles. His works 
were shown during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, at the 
International Art Exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"Unknown Realities" will be on exhibit through Dec. 15 at the MRL gallery, 4718 
E. 2nd St., Long Beach. MRL Fine Art is open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday 
through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Sunday. Admission is free. For more information, call MRL Fine Art at 439-2108. 
</P>
<P>
Car shoppers and car enthusiasts alike will gather at the Long Beach Convention 
Center for the sixth annual Long Beach International Auto Show. More than 500 
of the new 1991 models will be on display Wednesday through Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland's first showing of 1991 cars will feature more than 40 major 
lines, including the much-anticipated Saturn from General Motors. England's 
Lotus Elan convertible will make its West Coast debut. Acura will unveil its 
all-new 1991 Legend sedan. Volvo will present its new 940 series, which 
replaces the 760 models. Spectators can get behind the wheel of the Dodge 
Stealth and Mitsubishi 3000 GT. 
</P>
<P>
Special cars will make appearances at the auto show. The Chevrolet Lumina "Days 
of Thunder" movie race car will be displayed along with the Pontiac concept 
car, the Banshee. 
</P>
<P>
Lifestyles Promotions will hold a drawing for a new 1991 car. Cadillac will 
hold a drawing for the use of an Alante for two weeks. There will be an 
appearance by Hanna-Barbera's Flintstone characters and the Flintmobile. 
</P>
<P>
Doors will be open from noon to 10 p.m. Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday 
through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Nov. 25. The convention center is at 300 
E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. Admission is $5; children under 12 are free when 
accompanied by an adult. Visitors are welcome to bring cameras. For more 
information, call 436-3636. MIKE RAMOS

'VILLAGE' COVER-UP IS HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with incredulity of the $16-million Long Beach proposal to disguise oil 
derricks as redwood pillars, conceal shabby properties with wave-decorated 
walls, attempt to cover street noises with the "music" of a giant whale chime, 
and refer to a city of 500,000 as a "village" (Times, Nov. 4). The thought that 
kept running through my head was "Potemkin Village." 
</P>
<P>
Over 200 years ago, a powerful Russian leader, charged by Empress Catherine II 
with the task of colonizing the Ukrainian Steppes, undertook vast and expensive 
developments. As so often happens today, the cost far exceeded projections, 
forcing Grigori Potemkin to abandon his ambitious projects halfway to 
completion. Then came word that the Empress would be touring the area to view 
the wonders he had wrought. 'Twas said that he "disguised the weaknesses" in 
his program, giving rise to tales that he had erected artificial villages -- in 
truth, mere facades -- to impress the Empress as she swept through the region. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the definition of a Potemkin Village is: "any pretentious facade 
designed to cover up shabby or undesirable conditions." History does, indeed, 
repeat itself.

NEW COVER WON'T IMPROVE CONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your article in last week's Long Beach section in absolute disbelief and 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taking a look at external issues of "sprucing up Long Beach's tired 
image," why doesn't the city address some of the internal issues that will make 
Long Beach a more desirable and safe area to live? 
</P>
<P>
The city can't just sit back idly and wish the real internal problems to go 
away, especially when the statistics were on the following pages of the same 
paper, "Murders Up 25% in L.B. From Same Period in '89." 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, to simply put up a wall to "cover up ugly spots" and call it a 
"site enhancement" it will soon be a target of the graffiti kings. And how much 
money will be needed to budget and continuously repaint our site enhancements? 
</P>
<P>
I agree, it is essential to maintain a positive city image. One can always put 
a beautiful cover on a bad book, but it won't change the content. It will still 
be a bad book.

GOOD SPORTS SEND BASEBALL CARDS TO GULF; 
</P>
<P>
MORALE: LAWNDALE SHOP OWNER MOBILIZES COLLECTORS TO DONATE THOUSANDS OF CARDS 
TO BORED AMERICAN TROOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush gears up to send more armored divisions to the Persian Gulf, 
Dugout Baseball Cards owner Perry Dodd is planning to send a few big guns of 
his own -- former slugger Reggie Jackson, all-star pitcher Dennis (Oil Can) 
Boyd and superstar shortstop Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The players, of course, won't be boarding jets for the Middle East. But 
thousands of baseball cards bearing their pictures and those of other sports 
heroes will. 
</P>
<P>
Moved by newspaper accounts of the boredom of the men and women in uniform in 
Saudi Arabia, Dodd figured he was staring at thousands of examples of the 
perfect antidote. So last month, the 29-year-old baseball enthusiast started 
setting aside cards and soliciting donations from the regulars who frequent his 
shop in a mini-mall on Prairie Avenue in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
"Just hearing about how bored they are over there, I thought it would be an 
interesting thing (the troops) could do," Dodd said. "Baseball is the 
all-American pastime. I thought they would enjoy trading them, or just using 
them to break the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Draped with American flags and sports banners, Dodd's shop is also stocked with 
bubble gum and beef jerky shaped to resemble chewing tobacco. Visitors speak in 
low voices so as not to disturb customers who are absorbed in the sports trivia 
on the backs of cards. 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten sign over a table stacked with baseball cards at the back of the 
store declares: "Bring a 'peace' of America to the Middle East. We are sending 
sports cards. Goal -- 10,000. Any donations are appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
When Dodd penned the sign, he expected that it would take a while to meet his 
goal. But customers greeted the idea with so much enthusiasm that he now 
expects to be able to send twice that many -- more than $2,000 worth -- by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could send more," Dodd said. "There's so many guys over there, and 
I'm not going to be able to get cards to one-tenth" of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd isn't the only one in the sports card business hoping to send a piece of 
America to the troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A card shop in Illinois recently donated 800 cases of baseball cards to the 
Middle East, and Upper Deck, a major manufacturer of cards, expects to be 
sending baseball and other sports cards for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy Lt. Phillip Ishikawa of the Defense Logistics Agency said hobby items 
such as sports cards are one thing Operation Desert Shield's soldiers just 
can't get enough of. Such gifts do not go unnoticed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Department appreciates all the help people are sending," Ishikawa 
said last week. "It's very important psychologically (for the troops) because 
it lets them know the American people are behind them. The psychological edge 
of knowing that people haven't forgotten about you is important to your 
morale."

AFTER BLOODY WEEK, COLOMBIA POISED TO ATTACK REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN YARBRO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Colombian army is poised for a possible attack on the headquarters of the 
country's oldest and largest leftist guerrilla group after a week of fighting 
that killed about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian troops are digging into a southeastern stretch of jungle after an 
offensive last week in which 400 soldiers captured a main camp belonging to the 
Colombia Revolutionary Armed Forces, known by its Spanish acronym FARC. 
Officials have still not determined the battle's final death toll, but radio 
reports said two soldiers and at least 35 rebels were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive brought the army within 15 miles of the rebels' headquarters. 
Defense Minister Oscar Botero said Friday that the army might attack the 
headquarters despite the FARC's reiterated offer to open peace talks with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
President Cesar Gaviria tacitly approved the attack when he said troops could 
go after the guerrillas without first consulting him. The administration had 
previously restrained the army while it made efforts to draw the FARC, with its 
estimated 5,000 combatants, into negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Bombing of the headquarters' support camp by U.S.-provided A-37 jets began Nov. 
6. As army troops were overrunning the camp, the FARC and another rebel group, 
the National Liberation Army, or ELN, began a series of attacks that left 
scores dead throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the violence, Gaviria forswore negotiations with the FARC and 
the ELN until they "demonstrate their desire for peace through action, not 
words." 
</P>
<P>
The government demands that rebels declare a unilateral cease-fire as a 
condition for negotiations. The guerrillas maintain that the cease-fire should 
be bilateral. 
</P>
<P>
Three other guerrilla groups have suspended armed actions while they talk peace 
with officials. The largest of the organizations, the People's Liberation Army, 
plans to lay down its arms in December. 
</P>
<P>
Only one leftist guerrilla group has disarmed and transformed itself into a 
political party under the government's peace plan. The Gaviria administration 
has held up the group, the M-19, as proof that former rebels can participate in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
The M-19's leader, Antonio Navarro, won third place in August presidential 
elections and served as health minister under Gaviria. He resigned to run in 
December elections for a seat in an assembly to rewrite Colombia's 
constitution. Polls show the M-19 leading traditional parties, the Liberals and 
Conservatives, in the race for 70 assembly seats. 
</P>
<P>
But there were signs last week that the peace process with the M-19 was in 
trouble. Navarro said Friday that the M-19 had discovered a plot to assassinate 
him. His statement came after days of grumbling about the former guerrillas by 
army officials and traditional politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring up anger at the M-19 is a recent decision by the attorney general's 
office to punish an army general who fought the rebel group in November, 1985, 
when it took over the Palace of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven supreme court justices were among the 95 people killed when the army, 
under the command of Gen. Jesus Arias Cabrales, attacked the building. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office ordered the retired general's symbolic dismissal, 
ruling that he failed to protect hostages held by the M-19. 
</P>
<P>
Army officials and members of Colombia's Congress denounced the decision as 
grossly unfair. They said that a loyal general was being punished for the 
incident while the M-19, which instigated the bloodshed, was receiving 
political laurels.

EXPLODING BASEBALL BAT IN CHILE KILLS 1, HURTS AMERICAN

<P>
A bomb hidden inside a baseball bat exploded Saturday during a game between a 
university team and the Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce, killing a 
Canadian businessman and wounding a U.S. Embassy employee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The aluminum bat filled with explosives blew up during the game at Santiago's 
National Stadium, killing Canadian businessman James Thomas Johnson, police 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 36, who had arrived recently in Chile, worked for a seafood export 
company, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A man who said he represented the Palestine Liberation Organization called 
Radio Monumental and claimed responsibility for the blast. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a taste of what will happen to North American dictator Bush if he sets 
foot in Chile, a country we love and respect," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is scheduled to tour Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and 
Venezuela on Dec. 2-8. His itinerary includes stops in Santiago and Valparaiso 
on Dec. 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Collins, 28, a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, and 
Canadians Frank Joseph and Frank Arsenau were wounded in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Charles A. Gillespie Jr. visited Collins in a hospital and said 
later that he was out of danger. Aluminum splinters injured Collins' right eye, 
medical sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A PLO delegation is visiting Chile, and hundreds of demonstrators gathered 
Saturday outside the presidential palace in Santiago to demand recognition for 
the state of Palestine, proclaimed two years ago by the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's baseball program had also included a second game between two teams 
formed by members of the Marine detail at the U.S. Embassy, a spokesman for the 
military police said. Police sources said they suspected the bomb was intended 
to harm the military players.

DEMOCRACY IS THE BIGGEST LOSER IN MEXICO STATE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What if they gave an election and nobody came? Or what if they gave an election 
and nobody believed in it? To a degree, both of those things happened last 
Sunday, when only about 30% of registered voters cast ballots in the state of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The election for mayors and a legislature in the state of Mexico -- and another 
in the state of Hidalgo on the same day -- was to test the political 
modernization promised by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the 
credibility of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled 
Mexico for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI has claimed a landslide in Mexico state, apparently winning all but 
four of 121 mayoralties and the entire 34-seat legislature. Partial official 
returns issued Friday were confirming the PRI figures. Results in Hidalgo were 
equally lopsided. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties on the left and right charge that the PRI resorted to 
massive fraud. The conservative National Action Party and the leftist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party are calling for large portions of the vote to be 
annulled. In Mexico state, National Action has challenged results in 1,000 of 
4,293 polling places, while the Democratic Revolutionary Party has challenged 
4,000. 
</P>
<P>
But what may have been more significant than the alleged fraud in the outcome 
of Sunday's election is the fact that the vast majority of registered voters 
avoided the polls -- and most of those apparently belonged to the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI received only slightly more votes than it did in the 1988 presidential 
campaign, when leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won in the state of Mexico by 
a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly 1 million people who voted for Cardenas in 1988 did not vote this 
time, and National Action received at least 160,000 fewer votes. The ruling 
party did not win those people over -- they simply stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to non-voters interviewed on election day, was a lack of 
confidence in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter who you vote for, the PRI always wins," one typical non-voter said. 
"They'll never respect the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Many Cardenas supporters believe that he won the election nationwide and that 
the government stole the presidency for Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
PRI officials acknowledge a credibility problem but assert that their party won 
the Mexico state election fair and square with a vigorous campaign. Indeed, the 
ruling party did launch an elaborate campaign to identify its supporters block 
by block, woo its opposition in key areas and get out the vote on election day. 
</P>
<P>
But the PRI also was buoyed by unfair advantages that it enjoys as the 
government party. The government pumped $92 million into Mexico state through 
its Solidarity public works program, which was closely identified with the PRI. 
The Solidarity logo is red, white and green, the colors of the PRI and of the 
Mexican flag. 
</P>
<P>
PRI officials say they never used Solidarity as part of the campaign, but even 
at the party's closing rally in the municipality of Naucalpan, Solidarity was a 
prominently featured slogan. 
</P>
<P>
In another example, government and pro-government television ran frequent 
advertisements for the PRI, but no opposition ads were to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition charges that the PRI was more than advantaged. Among the 
charges: 
</P>
<P>
* That it issued multiple voting cards to PRI supporters, allowing them to vote 
more than once. 
</P>
<P>
* That its detailed analysis of voters in the 1988 election was used to "shave" 
opposition supporters from the registration rolls. 
</P>
<P>
* That election officials took registration cards away from opposition 
supporters during the two months before the vote and failed to issue them new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
* That they "intimidated" the opposition, threatening to withdraw tortilla and 
milk subsidies and other government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio admitted that there may have been 
"irregularities" in about 100 polling places in Mexico state on election day, 
but he said that was not enough to change the results of the election. 
</P>
<P>
"In the state of Mexico, we prepared conscientiously. We won with organization 
and work. . . . We learned our lesson in 1988," Colosio said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the PRI called itself the party of the majority. It often claimed 
election victories with 75% to 90% of the vote, and in 1976, PRI candidate Jose 
Lopez Portillo ran for president unopposed. Several times when National Action 
challenged the PRI at the state and local level, the government was accused of 
stealing the race. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling party was stunned by the 1988 presidential election, which Salinas 
officially won with 50.3% of the vote -- the lowest ever for a PRI candidate. 
When he took office, Salinas vowed to see Mexico into an era of truly 
competitive multi-party politics, what he called political modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the government acknowledged defeat to the National Action Party in 
the governor's race in Baja California, but elections in Michoacan, Guerrero 
and Coahuila states were fraught with charges of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Now, once again in Mexico, the PRI won the vote but failed to win the 
credibility it sought. The PRI won the state vote with about 17% of the 4.3 
million registered voters -- hardly a sweeping mandate. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, on the other hand, also suffered a devastating setback. Not 
only did their parties fail to achieve power, but they also failed to persuade 
their supporters to vote. In the end, public distrust hurt the opposition more 
than it hurt the PRI, which had the resources to get out its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, who ran on a coalition ticket in 1988, showed that he has not yet 
converted his Democratic Revolutionary Party into a force strong enough to 
mobilize its members. National Action, which is 50 years old, says fraud kept 
it from victory in Naucalpan, the state's wealthiest municipality where they 
had strong support. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the dispute over election results in the town of Chinconcuac led to 
a confrontation between PRI and Democratic Revolutionary Party supporters that 
left nine injured, six of them with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, political observers say, the biggest loser in the Mexico state 
election is not any single party, but the development of democracy in Mexico.

"My impression is that these were neither free nor fair elections," said 
attorney Jose Agustine Ortiz Pinquetti, who observed the Mexico state vote for 
a new watchdog group called Council for Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the fraud was on the border between legal and illegal. But what's 
clear is that there is no will on the part of the government to move toward a 
democracy. The will is to restore the old system," he said. "This is a blow not 
just for the opposition, but for democracy. If the opposition loses its base, 
the system will not tend to become more democratic."

Several thousand young people demanding the abolition of military service 
marched through Berlin on Saturday in a peaceful demonstration capping a week 
of violent rioting in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police cordoned off the route, questioning or frisking anyone 
wanting to join the march. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were protesting the reintroduction of conscription in western 
Berlin since German unification and the ending of the rights of the World War 
II allies. City residents had been exempt from military service under an 
agreement among the four major war victors -- the Soviet Union, the United 
States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, police fought fierce street battles with militant building 
squatters in eastern Berlin and evicted them.

The music has improved, but Iraq's propaganda pitch to American soldiers 
remains the same: You're risking your life and wasting your time in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In daily broadcasts on what is now called the Voice of Peace, Baghdad Radio's 
English-language programming contains warnings to GIs that they risk coming 
down with "craziness" from long spells in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Announcers, who include a woman dubbed Baghdad Betty by the troops, tell them 
that their Arab allies will turn their guns on U.S. soldiers instead of Iraqis. 
The messages also raise doubts about the U.S. role in the region. 
</P>
<P>
GIs say they listen to the music but tune out the commentary. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of Tokyo Rose during World War II and Hanoi Hannah in Vietnam, 
Iraq started its blend of music, news and propaganda when the U.S. military 
buildup began after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the hourlong programs interspersed Arabic music and Western 
big-band sounds with taunts. 
</P>
<P>
"To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert," a voice would say. "Would 
you like to be one of the cripples who are only lamented in the charity 
ceremonies?" 
</P>
<P>
Now, the programs are three hours long and the music is top-40 contemporary 
rock and oldies-but-goodies from the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The female announcer dubbed Baghdad Betty or a male colleague occasionally 
interrupts with comments. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, for instance, an announcer said: "One of your pals even killed 
himself a week ago, feeling terribly lonely. And two GIs quarreled with each 
other, and one of them shot his colleague after they used to be good friends. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only normal. For one who is not accustomed to live in the desert, and 
is forced to do so for so long a time, could easily be driven to craziness. 
Then, suicide is the only way out." 
</P>
<P>
The announcer apparently was referring to a U.S. soldier found dead in a shower 
on Nov. 8 and the shooting death of a Marine the next day. Military officials 
acknowledge the apparent suicide but say the shooting was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the radio is one of the few diversions available to the U.S. 
troops in Saudi Arabia. The Americans say they listen to Baghdad Betty and her 
band but are not unnerved by the propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Said Staff Sgt. Joseph Herald, 34, member of a field artillery unit from Ft. 
Lewis, Wash.: "As long as she plays good music, who cares what she has to say?"

BUSH CONFIDENT OF U.S. SWAY IN THE NEW EUROPE 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is approaching the 34-nation European summit in Paris on Monday 
confident that the United States will achieve its goals in shaping new 
institutions to help manage the evolution of Europe in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
As the three-day parley gets under way, the United States already has won 
assurances on its two biggest concerns: Washington will continue to have a 
voice in European affairs and the new institutions that Europe creates this 
week will not diminish the role of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphant as Bush may be in the short run, the Paris summit marks the symbolic 
beginning of the challenge of maintaining U.S. influence in the new European 
order that is emerging after more than 40 years of divisions between East and 
West. 
</P>
<P>
In a real sense, Paris will mark the end of superpower domination of the 
Continent, many American analysts believe. Unless Bush and his senior aides are 
vigilant during this week's sessions, the new order could still be fraught with 
long-term problems for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The changes overtaking European geopolitics are stunning. Instead of the Cold 
War Europe that was controlled from the periphery by Washington and Moscow, the 
Continent now will have a variety of power centers, not all of them congenial 
to U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bush Administration, the Paris summit has been largely an exercise in 
damage control -- making sure that the 33 other national leaders do not do 
anything that might diminish American influence, especially by weakening the 
primacy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Measured by that limited standard, Bush is certain to be successful. The summit 
meeting of the little-known institution called the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) will give only limited new powers to the 
organization. NATO's position as the primary guarantor of security in Europe is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
So far at least, the heads of the major European powers have shown no interest 
in edging the United States off the Continent. To the contrary, they have made 
clear a strong desire for continued U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some American analysts warn that Washington's welcome in Europe 
could gradually begin to erode, posing difficult long-term problems for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for difficulties may be increased, they warn, if easy victories 
on specific points, and the distraction of the Persian Gulf crisis, lead Bush 
and his senior aides to underestimate the importance of this summit. 
</P>
<P>
As the shock of cataclysmic events subsides, and Europe becomes more 
comfortable with the changes brought on by the rapid end of the Cold War, its 
leaders may assert their right to control their destiny without significant 
help from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the topic in Europe," said Rozanne Ridgway, former assistant secretary 
of state for European affairs. "There is a sense that Europe is coming into, at 
last, the management of its own affairs. Europe today is very introspective and 
looking at its own future. 
</P>
<P>
"The (West) European public will be watching Paris with a great sense of 
history taking place," Ridgway said. "And for East and Central Europeans, this 
is a coming-out party." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway and others recently back from Europe caution that the United States 
should not fail to appreciate the importance of the summit to Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
If Washington is careful in its approach to the CSCE, experts in foreign 
affairs say, the United States can use the CSCE process to dampen Europeans' 
isolationist tendencies and help to lock in a U.S. role in European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is understood that the United States and Canada (the only CSCE members 
located outside Europe) are regarded as European powers in CSCE," said Helmut 
Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and National Security Council analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"It is another way for the United States to act as and be perceived as a 
European power." 
</P>
<P>
The Paris summit is the first meeting of all CSCE national leaders since 1975, 
when they signed what is known as the Helsinki Final Act, a treaty that locked 
in the post-World War II boundaries of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki conference also adopted a list of human rights standards that, 
although largely overlooked at the time, set off a chain of events that 14 
years later fueled the grass-roots revolution that toppled communism in most of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the summit is expected to approve plans giving CSCE its first 
permanent bureaucracy: a small secretariat that will be headquartered in 
Prague, Czechoslovakia. The leaders also plan to create a crisis resolution 
center and an organization to observe elections. 
</P>
<P>
Some European leaders wanted to give the organization far more power than that, 
but they backed away in the face of U.S. opposition. The Bush Administration 
wanted to keep CSCE relatively weak to make sure it would not upstage NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to create the illusion that we're in the middle of a brave new 
world," a senior State Department official declared. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts outside the government believe the Bush Administration may have 
overdone it in keeping CSCE weak. 
</P>
<P>
"The most significant threat to peace and stability in Europe comes from the 
ethnic, religious and national rivalries in the liberated countries (of Eastern 
Europe)," said Robert Hunter, a former National Security Council expert on 
Europe. "The CSCE summit will set up a conflict resolution center, but it is 
nothing but a talking shop. It has no capacity for conciliation, mediation or 
arbitration. That is woefully inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said it is beyond CSCE's ability to resolve ethnic conflicts that, 
although suppressed by communism since World War II, have festered for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair to ask the CSCE to do that, but that is what many people will be 
using as the first judgment of whether or not CSCE is a worthwhile 
organization," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis center, officially to be known as the Center for the Prevention of 
Crises and located initially in Vienna, is intended to exchange information on 
the movement of military forces by member nations. 
</P>
<P>
A communications network will be set up to serve as a low-level hot line over 
which complaints about unusual or threatening military maneuvers can be 
immediately discussed. 
</P>
<P>
In time, the center may take on efforts to mediate political disputes, 
especially ethnic and national conflicts in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, CSCE will have a decided Eastern-looking focus. Western European 
leaders agreed to put the organization's headquarters in Prague as recognition 
of the democratization process in the formerly Communist nations of Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the West, CSCE is eclipsed by NATO and the European Community, both 
far stronger institutions. But CSCE is the only regional organization that has 
extended its membership to Eastern Europe. With the disintegration of the 
Warsaw Pact defense alliance, CSCE is about all the East Europeans have to hold 
on to. 
</P>
<P>
The planned election monitoring agency is aimed specifically at Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is really concerned about monitoring elections in France and Germany; 
it pertains to states that are emerging from their Communist and dictatorial 
past," Sonnenfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said that some Eastern European leaders are already referring to CSCE 
as a transitory organization, a way-station to a larger and more powerful 
Europe-wide organization. Under CSCE's rules, it is difficult to see how the 
institution could evolve in that direction as long as Washington objects. 
</P>
<P>
CSCE operates by consensus, meaning that all 34 nations must approve any 
action. Critics charge that the procedure -- which gives veto power to such 
politically insignificant states as San Marino, Malta and the Vatican -- will 
immobilize the organization, preventing it from taking on controversial 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE summit participants also must decide if the organization needs a 
legislative apparatus. Some European nations are proposing a new "Assembly of 
Europe" to include legislators from all 34 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The basis for this is the existing Council of Europe, a largely ceremonial 
gathering of representatives of 21 nations -- essentially the CSCE membership, 
with the exception of the United States, Canada, Finland, the six nations of 
the Warsaw Pact and the mini-states, such as Monaco and the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
A later meeting of lawmakers from all countries will decide the matter.

Barbara Bush on Saturday shared the secrets of a dog's life in the White House 
with Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel's wife, Olga, and schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
In a quick tour of Prague during President Bush's one-day visit to 
Czechoslovakia, Mrs. Bush and Olga Havlova visited pupils at an 
English-language school. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush read excerpts from a book written in the name of her dog, Millie, to 
the schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," Mrs. Bush said, displaying pictures of the President sprawling 
on a White house lawn with spaniel puppies. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine a President of the United States being that serious?" 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush told the class of wide-eyed 11-year-olds that her dog is allowed to 
roam the White House and regularly attends meetings of the National Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"So Millie knows more about the Persian Gulf and Czechoslovakia than I do," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, the first U.S. President to visit Czechoslovakia, arrived in Prague on 
Saturday morning to celebrate the first anniversary of Czechoslovakia's return 
to political freedom after four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush and Havel met in Prague's lavish Hradcany Castle, their wives visited 
mentally handicapped children in a gray, wind-swept suburb.

<P>
As Czechoslovakia celebrates the anniversary of its peaceful revolution, new 
monuments continue to be created in Prague. The latest, set up Thursday in the 
window of a clothing store on the city's main shopping street, consists of a 
blood-stained tan raincoat and an explanatory placard. 
</P>
<P>
In Czech and English, the placard explains that on the night of Nov. 17, 1989, 
when police attacked student demonstrators in downtown Prague, among their 
victims were American reporters covering the events. Paula Buterini, a 
correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, was beaten so badly that "she fell back 
and her head split open," later requiring 14 stitches, the placard says. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody coat, the placard explains, belonged to Times correspondent Tyler 
Marshall, who caught Buterini as she fell and later accompanied her to a city 
hospital for treatment.

MAIN POINTS OF THE SOVIET PLAN

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the main points of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to 
drastically change the Soviet governmental structure: 
</P>
<P>
 * Abolish the position of prime minister and downgrade the Council of 
Ministers, the main government organ, chaired by the prime minister. However, 
Gorbachev adviser Georgy Shakhnazarov said the council, or Cabinet, would 
continue to exist as a "working organ" to furnish technical and executive 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
* Overhaul the Federation Council, a consultative body of leaders of the 15 
Soviet republics plus Gorbachev, granting it a veto over actions of any 
republic that affect national interests. 
</P>
<P>
* Create a National Security Council, subordinate to Gorbachev, to include 
chiefs of KGB secret police and Interior Ministry. Its powers and functions 
were not immediately clear. Political scientist Fyodor M. Burlatsky, 
editor-in-chief of Literary Gazette, said the council would be the "real 
Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
* Form an elite law-enforcement agency, the Special Service, to fight organized 
crime, black-marketeering and other illegal acts "engulfing the country." Its 
officers could be on the streets in 10 days, Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
* Complete within 14 days a food-distribution plan to ensure that famine does 
not break out in the Soviet Union this winter. 
</P>
<P>
* Take "operational measures" to guarantee functioning of "life-support 
systems," including railroads and coal mines, that have frequently been closed 
by strikes or ethnic unrest.

Scientists have positively identified a skeleton exhumed from a New York 
cemetery as the remains of a Haitian slave who is a candidate to become 
America's first black saint, Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A team of archeologists, forensic scientists and anthropologists determined 
that a skeleton dug up earlier this month was that of Pierre Toussaint, the 
cardinal said. 
</P>
<P>
Toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to New York at age 21 by his French 
owners. Still enslaved, he became a leading hairdresser in the city and was 
allowed to keep some of his income. 
</P>
<P>
Freed in 1807, he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on charities, 
including an orphanage and the city's first school for black children. 
</P>
<P>
He is considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the needy 
for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed.

BENNETT TO SUCCEED ATWATER, SOURCES SAY 
</P>

<P>
President Bush has asked former drug czar William J. Bennett to take over Lee 
Atwater's job as chairman of the Republican Party in January and Bennett has 
accepted, GOP sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, a former secretary of education in Ronald Reagan's Cabinet, formally 
resigned Nov. 8 as head of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy. 
</P>
<P>
A GOP source said Atwater, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, will 
continue to play a major strategy role for the GOP, possibly with a title as 
the party's "general chairman." 
</P>
<P>
Such a structure would not be unique, the source said, citing Frank J. 
Fahrenkopf Jr.'s chairmanship of the Republican National Committee in the 1980s 
while then-Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) held the title as the party's general 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement will not be made until Bush returns from his eight-day 
trip to Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, Egypt and the Persian Gulf, said the 
source, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, 39, has been undergoing intensive treatment for cancer since a tumor 
was discovered on the right side of his brain last March. His two-year term as 
GOP chairman expires in January. 
</P>
<P>
B. J. Cooper, a Republican Party spokesman, said that Bennett "is on a short 
list of people being considered" to succeed Atwater "but there's been no formal 
announcement at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said Bush's choice for a new Republican chairman would have to be 
ratified by the party's national committee in January. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, meeting with his party's $100,000 
donors in Atlanta, said he welcomes Bennett's appointment as his chief 
adversary with "open arms." 
</P>
<P>
"If Bennett accomplishes as much for the Republican Party as he achieved at the 
Education Department and in ridding us of drugs and violence, Americans will 
have to begin worrying about the future of the two-party system," Brown 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater has been more of a tactician than an ideologue. After GOP candidates 
lost to abortion-rights Democrats in two high-profile governors races in 1989, 
he acted quickly to move the Republican Party away from its hard-line 
opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has what Democrats denounced as a "pit bull style of politics," 
citing his use of "Willie Horton" ads against Democratic presidential nominee 
Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Horton is a convicted murderer who raped a woman in Maryland during a furlough 
from a Massachusetts prison while Dukakis was the state's governor. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, 47, also has a reputation for confrontation and brashness. Two weeks 
ago when Bush accepted his resignation, Bennett called Rep. Charles B. Rangel 
(D-N.Y.), a frequent critic of his drug policies, "a gasbag."

OFF-DUTY FONTANA OFFICER SHOT IN STOMACH;

An off-duty Fontana police officer was shot in the stomach when he walked out 
of a local convenience store that may have been targeted for robbery, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old officer, whose name was withheld pending notification of 
relatives, was in fair condition at an area hospital, Fontana police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place shortly after 11 p.m. Friday at a Stop &amp; Go Market 
in the 16800 block of Slover Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer had just finished his shift and was not in uniform when he was shot 
"without warning" near his car in the store's parking lot, Detective Fred 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Although police said the assailant may have been with a group of men intending 
to rob the store, the officer did not appear to be intervening when he was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he knew what was happening," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Three men, including the gunman, fled the parking lot in a silver car, perhaps 
a new Toyota Celica, the wounded officer told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, a three-year veteran, returned fire as the assailants drove off, 
striking the driver's side of the car with bullets, police said. Further damage 
was done to the left side of the car when it struck a steel pole in the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Several people along the street and in the store witnessed the shooting, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the assailants, possibly the gunman, was described as 5 feet, 9 inches 
tall; weighing 160 pounds, and having a brown ponytail, Flores said. The man 
was wearing black overalls and a black sweat jacket. The men were described as 
in their late teens or early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Occupants of a second car seen fleeing the parking lot at the time of the 
shooting were being sought for questioning. Detectives described the car as a 
late-model, dark-colored two-door Chevrolet Impala.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said Saturday it has begun notifying some of its 
office workers that they will either be transferred or let go after New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
The affected employees are an undetermined number among the estimated 20,000 
people who work in areas including customer service, accounting and payroll in 
the 850 Sears stores across the nation, spokesman Gerald Buldak said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really too soon to tell" how many employees will be affected, but most 
work part time, Buldak said. He added that some staff functions will be merged 
at a hub office in some stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees displaced would have an opportunity to work elsewhere in a store, if 
a job existed, or would not have a job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the company began seeking ways to improve customer service and to 
cut costs, Buldak said. Using employee ideas, Sears tested pared-down 
procedures at 10 stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company began notifying workers late last week that they could be either 
transferred or lose their jobs through a nationwide cost-cutting effort, Buldak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Sears reported sharply lower net income for the third straight 
quarter, with overall earnings down 30%, but said that its retail unit had 
improved. The retail group accounts for more than half of all company revenues.

NEW BILL MAY PAVE PATH FOR IRISH ALIENS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: MANY OF THE LATEST ARRIVALS FIND OPPORTUNITIES SEVERELY LIMITED. 
GIVEN THEIR EDUCATION AND SKILLS, FRUSTRATION RUNS HIGH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-six-year-old Brendan had high hopes of success when he came here from 
his native Ireland as that country's economy turned sour in 1988. America is "a 
country where you can come and go-get-it," he says. "I want to work for myself. 
I want to move." 
</P>
<P>
But for the past 2 1/2 years, Brendan has been stymied. Although he has two 
years of college, he can't qualify for much more than a bartender's job. He 
worries about filling out medical forms. And he has had to live in fear of 
arrest -- by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan (he won't give his last name) is part of a new wave of Irish 
immigrants, some 100,000 or more who have landed on U.S. soil in recent years, 
many of them here in Boston, where a similar influx -- in the early 1900s -- 
settled, worked and eventually made good. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the earlier Irish immigrants, Brendan and most of his well-educated or 
highly skilled compatriots haven't been absorbed very readily. The job market 
is tight, and not having the proper immigration documents severely limits what 
they can do. 
</P>
<P>
Even more stultifying, increasingly restrictive U.S. immigration laws have 
virtually barred Irish subjects from becoming U.S. citizens unless they are 
relatives of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself stalled by my illegality," Brendan laments. "You only live 
three-score-and-10, you know. I feel my time, my best years are running out." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, there may be some relief. The new immigration bill that Congress 
recently passed provides preferential treatment for Irish immigrants that could 
offer Brendan and thousands of others already here new opportunities to become 
"legal." 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in legislation to increase legal immigration to 700,000 persons a year, 
from the current 500,000, are provisions for some 48,000 entry visas just for 
Irish immigrants -- more than double the number allotted to any other 
nationality. President Bush is expected to sign the bill into law. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say once the legislation becomes law it effectively will pave a new 
express lane from Ireland to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The reforms will have a beneficial impact on Irish people wanting to find a 
better life in America," says Declan Kelleher, an Irish government spokesman. 
"Many Irish are living in an out-of-status capacity. . . . This (law) should be 
able to get them proper credentials." 
</P>
<P>
But the transition won't be easy. Currently, few of the illegal Irish aliens 
fully understand the new bill, and many are distrustful of any government 
promises. And the U.S. economy is in a slump, dampening job prospects for all 
in America, even for those legal workers who hold "green cards." 
</P>
<P>
And while the new procedures give a slight advantage to the estimated 100,000 
Irish who are here illegally as opposed to applicants still living in Ireland, 
the process isn't automatic. Because visas will be issued on a first-come, 
first-served basis, many could go to applicants abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The task of spreading information about the new bill to worried Irish illegal 
aliens here -- and coaxing them to apply for their visas -- is expected to fall 
heavily upon an extensive network of relief agencies, Roman Catholic church 
officials and Irish rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
But here, too, there are obstacles to be surmounted. As more illegal immigrants 
have come to the United States, relations among some of these groups have 
become strained, with the newer organizations adopting tactics that older ones 
find offensive. In some cases, the new Irish immigrants are encountering 
friction with their predecessors of decades ago, many of whom resent the 
newcomers' radically different values. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the old immigrants came here in the past from poor and rural 
communities in Ireland, which colors the way they remember the place," explains 
Ken, a 41-year-old illegal immigrant who is living in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
"The young people coming here now are better educated, they come from the 
cities and many have traveled before settling here. They're not as religious as 
their parents or the older immigrants. They have a totally different view of 
Ireland, themselves and the world." 
</P>
<P>
The split has shown up most visibly in the efforts of the Irish Immigration 
Reform Movement, a New York-based organization that was instrumental in pushing 
the new, expanded immigration quotas for Irish aliens through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Formed out of splinter groups of illegal immigrants themselves, the group -- 
which has chapters in several large cities with sizable numbers of Irish aliens 
-- hired Washington lobbyists and enlisted the aid of lawmakers who are 
influential in setting immigration policy, such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), Reps. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) and Joe Moakley (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
Although the IIRM achieved its aims, it did so in a way that tended to make 
members of the old-line Irish-American community uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a sensational approach," gripes Bill McGowan, a Boston accountant 
and insurance broker who has been active in the Irish Working Committee, a 
coalition of relief and social service agencies that has been set up to help 
the city's immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The leaders in the Boston chapter (of IIRM) are a somewhat more radical group 
-- they like to attack the Establishment," McGowan says. 
</P>
<P>
But Donald O'Sullivan, president and chairman of IIRM's Boston chapter, brushes 
aside such criticisms as "90% envy and 10% objectivity" on the part of 
older-generation Irish-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The IIRM's tactics may have been aggressive, but there was nothing wrong with 
them, O'Sullivan says. "We were audacious, optimistic and confident," he 
concedes, but "We were very clear in what we wanted. We got down and dirty and 
did the work to change the law." 
</P>
<P>
Moira Maguire, a Boston native whose grandparents emigrated here in 1910, said 
she became active in IIRM lobbying because she remembered the stories that her 
grandmother told her of the difficult cultural transition that the earlier 
immigrants had encountered. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole generation of (Irish) people have become complacent," says Maguire, 
25, a college graduate who works as an administrative assistant in a Boston 
bank. "They have forgotten how difficult it was here before they became 
established in America." 
</P>
<P>
Ken, the 41-year-old illegal alien, believes the newcomers' higher education 
level and more aggressive posture is a plus, because they are coming here with 
a level of energy that the more impoverished Irish immigrants of the early 
1900s did not have. 
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of the IIRM have an opportunity, having set a precedent with the 
passage of the (immigration) legislation, to go into politics and to challenge 
the community's older and comfortable leaders in our community," Ken says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is important for us to bring in fresh ideas and perspectives 
to our community," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt the new bill will make life here a lot easier -- and 
potentially rewarding -- for thousands of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
For Joe, a 26-year-old bartender and construction worker who has been in Boston 
for about 18 months, qualifying for the new entry visa would end the 
frustrating hardships of having to live underground and provide the promise of 
an open life in America. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing three years of college, Joe left Ireland for a vacation here 
and never returned to his native country. About a month ago, he married an 
Irish woman who also has been living illegally in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, Joe says, the thought of being discovered crosses his mind 
-- "mostly when you hear that some Irish guy was caught. Then, you feel a 
little bit cautious." 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of a day when both he and his wife can "be just like any other 
American -- with an apartment, a bank account, credit cards and the works" -- 
overrides his fear of detection. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know too much about the details right now, but I intend to apply for 
it," he said of the new visa opportunity.

A pilot working as a spotter for a commercial fishing boat died after his 
single-engine plane slammed into the center of the island, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Bacon, 55, of San Pedro was flying solo when the Cessna 162 crashed 
on the island about 45 miles off the San Diego coast, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Dan 
Mincher said. Bacon took off from Torrance Municipal Airport to find schools of 
fish for the San Diego-based vessel Santa Maria, Mincher said. When the pilot 
did not return, his business partner reported him missing. A Coast Guard Falcon 
jet HU-25A spotted the wreckage.

<P>
A recall movement was started against a Merced County Superior Court judge 
because he allowed a convicted child molester to remain free pending an appeal 
of his case. 
</P>
<P>
Part-time high school teacher Ken Mackie said he is starting the recall against 
Judge Michael Hider to protect the children. If 10,000 signatures are 
collected, the recall will be placed on the ballot. A jury found Gary Parsons 
guilty Sept. 11 of molesting three boys. Hider sentenced him to 22 years, but 
ruled that Parsons could remain free in lieu of $300,000 bail, pending his 
appeal. Parsons failed to post the bail but has remained free.

<P>
It was not the kind of ending we have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, numbing in its repetition, a gang member in a car shoots someone 
on a street; shoots them dead. 
</P>
<P>
In time, a gang member is arrested. Looking either defiant or hangdog, he is 
delivered into the slow trammels of the trial courts. By the time he emerges 
from the other end, often convicted and sentenced, the crime has all but passed 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the ending was different. Swifter. More basic. It had 
something of the Old Testament about it: eye for eye, young life for young 
life, Ashley Johnson, killed at age 5, for Rance Benson, a suicide at age 18. 
The little drive-by shooting victim and the man police suspect of shooting her. 
Both dead. Both, it seems, by the same hand. 
</P>
<P>
Rance Benson, "Little Popeye," was on the Los Angeles Police Department's short 
list of two suspects in the killing of Ashley, the child shot in the back Nov. 
10 as she capered outside at a family birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect, a 17-year-old gang member whose name is being withheld, was 
already in custody. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, police went to an apartment in South-Central Los Angeles 
looking for the other one. As they were at the door, Benson shot himself in the 
head, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Which image, in the end, was with Benson when he pulled the trigger -- the 
thought of a little girl dead in her party clothes? Or of himself, locked down 
in a prison cell? 
</P>
<P>
Thedra Cullors lives upstairs from where Benson killed himself. She is as 
disgusted as anybody about what happened to Ashley. But she will give Benson 
this: "At least he did have a conscience. It did bother him. He couldn't rest 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Terrence Hall is 16 and Cullors' son. He had gotten into the habit of saying 
hello when he saw Benson coming and going from the apartment downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just seen him (Friday)," said Hall. "I said, 'What's up, man?' He put his 
head down and shook it and said, 'Man, I don't know.' He was depressed. He was 
like that all week." 
</P>
<P>
Why? Hall did not know -- until shortly after 10 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in there watching a movie, we heard a helicopter going by. I said 
nothing's happening, it's just flying over." 
</P>
<P>
It did not fly over, it stayed over. Hall looked out the back window and saw 
police. Then he looked out the front. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the police was just running up with guns and everything and telling us 
to get back in the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:04 p.m., an anonymous caller had told police where they could find Little 
Popeye. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers sent to Apartment 4 saw a woman sitting on a sofa and asked 
her to tell the man inside to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Popeye," she yelled, "the police want to talk to you!" 
</P>
<P>
It was her yelling that name that clued the officers in. They went inside 
Apartment 4, and Benson, surely knowing their mission, went in farther; into 
the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The police backed off and called for more officers. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's girlfriend was with him in the bedroom, Hall said, "and he pushed her 
out of the way and shot himself." From the bedroom, the police heard a woman 
call out, "He shot himself! Popeye shot himself!" 
</P>
<P>
Police found the suspect dead on the bedroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
In the wakeful hours, after police and the coroner had left, neighbors in the 
complex on South Avalon Boulevard stood restlessly in their doorways, talking 
about the dead child they had all heard about, and the dead man they all knew. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me he was just talking about killing himself earlier," said Cullors, 
"walking around talking about it all day." 
</P>
<P>
"They said he was sad about killing the girl," Hall said. "He was scared to go 
to jail, so he just took his own life. Some people said they wouldn't have 
killed themselves. But you really can't say what you'd do, if you'd killed a 
little girl and you were gonna go to jail and you don't know for how long." 
</P>
<P>
It was local gang members who first tipped them to Little Popeye's identity, 
police said. His death Friday night was what Southeast Division Sgt. Eric 
Coulter said is referred to as a "self solver." 
</P>
<P>
To the suicide downstairs, Cullors reacted like a mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope, I just wish some of these kids would think about it." 
</P>
<P>
In another upstairs apartment, through it all, Linda Cook and her five children 
stayed put. Their door remained shut. It usually does. Her children always come 
in at dusk, and stay in, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's incident convinced her she is right, Cook said. Saturday 
morning, 12 hours later, did not change her mind, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got gangbangers right now, out in front of the house," she said. "It's a 
tragic thing the boy killed himself. But it shows you it's not nothing, being 
in a gang. It's his conscience. How do you deal, day after day, with knowing 
you killed a child?" 
</P>
<P>
Cook said she moved to the apartment in July and feels ready to move again. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
JOURNALISM: OUTSIDE POST OFFICES, MARKETS AND BAKERIES A NUMBER OF 
SPANISH-LANGUAGE PAPERS ARE BATTLING FOR CIRCULATION.

In one hand, Norma Yanez carried a sack of groceries. In the other, she gripped 
four periodicos and a copy of "Teleguia." 
</P>
<P>
As she walked out of the North Hollywood supermarket with her food, newspapers 
and television guide, Yanez said she "takes as many papers as I can. I like to 
read the news, the stories -- especially news from Guatemala, my country." 
</P>
<P>
In heavily Latino neighborhoods in North Hollywood, Pacoima, Sun Valley and San 
Fernando; outside post offices, markets and bakeries called panaderias, a 
startling number of newspapers are battling for shelf space in what has become 
an increasingly competitive war of words -- words in Spanish, that is. 
</P>
<P>
With the debut last month of a free Spanish-language newspaper called El 
Universal, San Fernando Valley Latinos have two local twice-weekly 
publications. El Eco, which emphasizes local news in contrast to the 
international focus of El Universal, started three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The two are among a broad array of Spanish-language publications specializing 
in sports, entertainment or news that circulate in the Valley, reflecting the 
dramatic growth in the area's Latino population in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley up to this point has been devoid of a strong newspaper presence," 
said John Catalani, director of Burbank-based Hispanic Media Associates, the 
advertising sales firm for a consortium of 85 Spanish-language publications 
throughout the country. "Obviously, publishers have found there was a void and 
if there is a void you fill it." 
</P>
<P>
The dizzying selection of Spanish-language papers in heavily Latino 
neighborhoods mirrors the scene at newsstands in large Latin American cities, 
where people are accustomed to reading numerous news publications. 
</P>
<P>
"Immigrants come to this country with a background that is used to a high 
concentration of print media," said Henry E. Adams, executive vice president at 
Market Development Inc., a San Diego research firm that specializes in Latino 
marketing. "There is a thirst for newspapers if they can get them." 
</P>
<P>
Booming Latino communities such as Van Nuys, where the Latino population 
increased 76% from 1980 to 1987; Pacoima, where the Latino population rose 55%, 
and Sun Valley, with a 48% increase, constitute an attractive market for 
Spanish-language publications, according to demographic information provided by 
The Times' marketing research department and Market Statistics, which sells 
research material to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent to those of us in the publishing field that there are a 
substantial number of Latinos in the Valley who were not being spoken to as a 
community group," said Monica Lozano-Centanino, publisher of El Eco, which is 
owned by La Opinion. Half of La Opinion is owned by Times Mirror Co., parent 
company of the Los Angeles Times. "The market is large and it may be large 
enough for a number of publications." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the bundles of free papers on the floor, near the telephones and 
stacked high on a rack at Food Bag grocery store in North Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
In addition to El Eco and El Universal, there are four other free publications 
and three others that can be purchased. Those for sale are La Opinion and 
Noticias del Mundo, both Los Angeles metropolitan newspapers, and Diario Las 
Americas, a Miami-based daily newspaper of Latin American news. 
</P>
<P>
Those papers and others compete for a piece of the nation's most lucrative 
market for Spanish-language publications. Advertisers spent $16.2 million in 
1989 on print media in an area that includes San Bernardino, Orange, Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties, according to a study by Hispanic Business 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
For readers such as Vilda Herrera, 32, of North Hollywood, who left the store 
with three papers, the publications are the prime source of reading material 
for her large family. 
</P>
<P>
"Me, my husband, my four children, my in-laws, we all live together and every 
week we like to read all the papers we can," she said. "We think it's important 
to know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Galvez, 22, a busboy who came to North Hollywood from Mexico three years 
ago, said he has relied on the local newspapers for information on where to 
shop, find a doctor and go to school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the booming population and a seeming supply of eager readers, the 
competition was too much for three local Valley publications that folded in the 
past two years, including the venerable El Sol of San Fernando. El Dia and La 
Voz published only for two months in 1988.

THIS CITY RIVALRY USES BRAINS, NOT BRAWN; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMICS: UNIVERSITY HIGH WINS L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT 'SUPER QUIZ' IN A 
SQUEAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Perhaps the most intense and spirited competitive event locally Saturday was a 
true "squeaker," going right down to the wire. Those who witnessed it will be 
talking about it for months. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, those who watched it could probably have cared less about that other 
rivalry being decided across town between two large Los Angeles universities. 
</P>
<P>
That clash was just a matter of brawn. This one was all about brains. 
</P>
<P>
"The Super Quiz," one of the most competitive portions of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's Academic Decathlon, was staged Saturday in a gym at 
Occidental College in Eagle Rock before an overflow crowd of screaming parents, 
high school students and cheerleaders whose noisy enthusiasm often threatened 
to drown out the difficult questions being asked. 
</P>
<P>
The topic was space exploration. The students were thrown questions such as 
naming the rocket used to propel the Apollo missions off the earth's surface 
(Saturn 5) and knowing what MIR is (the current Soviet space station). 
</P>
<P>
In the end, University High School came out on top of the 55 schools battling 
it out -- um, thinking it out -- as the unofficial victor of the Super Quiz. 
They squeaked past the field by only one point. 
</P>
<P>
Four high schools tied for second place -- El Camino Real, Garfield, Taft and 
Pacific Palisades. Los Angeles High missed joining the group by a point. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's contest marked another showdown between archrivals Taft and El 
Camino Real, which won last year's quiz. 
</P>
<P>
The competition in this year's decathlon appears to be close among several 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really fabulous," said University decathlon coach John Reece after the 
quiz. "There were a number of really tough questions, but these kids came 
through. This was really important to them." 
</P>
<P>
University, a school on the Westside, came in eighth place in overall decathlon 
competition last year, and Reece said the team finished "way down" in the 
"Super Quiz" portion, which is one-tenth of the decathlon, an annual ritual for 
high schools all over the state. 
</P>
<P>
About 495 students competed in the all-day competition. The quiz is the only 
part of the decathlon held before an audience. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the decathlon will be formally announced at an awards banquet Nov. 
29 at the Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County high schools held their decathlon Saturday at Gahr High 
School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
For students who cheered their teams on Saturday, it seemed that they already 
felt their schools were the winners. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was more like a giant pep rally than an academic competition. 
Cheerleaders waved signs and parents waved video cameras. The uniforms of the 
quiz-takers ranged from T-shirts to more formal attire with ties. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the emcee, KTLA news anchor Larry McCormick, had to plead with the 
crowd to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
"Please calm down," he would say. "Every question may be the difference between 
winning and losing." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation for the quiz is fierce, school officials said. Students bone up 
during the summer and spring, go on field trips and study together as many as 
six days a week. They take special courses and use flash cards with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 1,000 points behind at this time last year, but we really worked hard, 
and now we're up there," said Don Walz, coach of the Palisades team. "It's 
important to the kids to work hard. Plus, it's nice to look good in public." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Mittoni, a University senior who was in the honors division of the team, 
said he got a perfect score on all 10 questions he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to do that well," he said. "And I only guessed on one."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PENN STATE DEFEATS TOP-RANKED IRISH, 24-21, WITH A 34-YARD 
FIELD GOAL IN FINAL SECONDS.

<P>
No. 1 Notre Dame's hopes for a national championship probably died in Craig 
Fayak's back yard in Belle Vernon, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Fayak kicked a 34-yard field goal with four seconds to play to give No. 18 Penn 
State a 24-21 victory Saturday over the Irish, handing them their second defeat 
as a top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've practiced that kick a thousand times in my back yard," Fayak said. "So I 
told my holder 'it's just like in my back yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Nittany Lions (8-2) tied the score, 21-21, when quarterback Tony Sacca, who 
threw for a career-high 277 yards, passed 14 yards to Al Golden with 7:15 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we thought we had nothing to lose," Sacca said. "We just played 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
Then defensive back Darren Perry intercepted Rick Mirer's pass over the middle 
for Shawn Davis and returned the ball to the Irish 19 with 59 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't going to settle for a tie," said Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, whose 
club is 8-2 and plays USC next Saturday in the Coliseum. "When you go over the 
middle, there is a 50-50 chance the safety is going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions moved the ball to the Notre Dame 17 in three plays, allowing the 
clock to run down before Fayak's attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been in this situation before in my life," Fayak said. "It probably 
won't sink in until I'm back home and I see it on tape." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's Walter Boyd returned a squib kick eight yards as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Two interceptions thrown by Mirer proved crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame played the second half without its leading offensive threat, Raghib 
(Rocket) Ismail, who left with a bruised thigh. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt we have built our offense around him, but you have to rise to the 
occasion," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer, who rushed for a touchdown and passed for 206 yards, had two passes 
intercepted in the second half, during which he completed only one pass for 21 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt at halftime we had too much respect for their receivers," Penn State 
Coach Joe Paterno said. "We gave them too much room." 
</P>
<P>
Sacca, replaced because of poor passing against Alabama and West Virginia, 
played the entire game and passed for touchdowns to Terry Smith, Rick Sayles 
and Golden. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame took control in the first quarter on touchdowns by Ricky Watters and 
Tony Brooks, and Mirer added a touchdown run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame scored on its first possession when Watters ran 22 yards for a 
touchdown in a 63-yard drive spurred by Mirer's 18-yard, third-down pass 
completion to Tony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish scored on the next possession when Brooks ran 12 yards after Mirer 
had hit Derek Brown for 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions held Notre Dame scoreless in the second half after trailing, 21-7, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's second touchdown was set up when linebacker Mark D'Onofrio 
intercepted Mirer's pass intended for Davis and returned the ball 38 yards to 
the Notre Dame 11. Sacca passed to Sayles, who bobbled the ball in the end zone 
and held on with 32 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I took my eye off the ball and juggled it, but I knew I'd make the catch," 
Sayles said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions scored when Sacca faked a reverse, then rolled to his right and 
completed a 32-yard pass play to Smith, who beat cornerback Todd Lyght to score 
Penn State's first touchdown at 4:29 of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer scored on a one-yard run to cap a 92-yard drive featuring completions of 
13 and 27 yards to Ismail and Ismail's six-yard run to the Penn State one.

CHARGERS-CHIEFS GAME WILL BE A TALE OF BIG BACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a Kansas City newspaper this week, Chief linebacker Dino Hackett suggested 
that Charger running back Marion Butts is a whole lot easier to tackle than 
Chief running back Christian Okoye. 
</P>
<P>
"Dino Hackett," Butts snorted. "Who is he? I don't even know him. Who is the 
guy? 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever he is, he's just shooting the wind -- a lot of people do that. It 
doesn't faze me. I had a pretty successful game against them last year. If 
anything, I think he should give me a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Butts ran for 176 yards against the Chiefs, but who remembers? Who 
noticed? 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Chargers versus the Chiefs was like the Patriots versus the 
Colts. Who cared? 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Chargers and Chiefs employed a forgettable cast of characters, 
and each team was going nowhere but home for the holidays. Ask 100 people back 
east last year what they knew about Butts, and you might have been slapped. 
</P>
<P>
But today the nation watches. The Chargers and Chiefs will play coast-to-coast 
on NBC-TV, and to the winner goes respect. And there also might be playoff 
implications to today's encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"All of sudden our team is getting a lot of attention," Chargers General 
Manager Bobby Beathard said. "Now it's the game of the week and all that kind 
of stuff. Everything points toward our playing well, but I don't know how this 
team handles pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't like all the attention. I wish we went unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight, however, has just begun to shine on the Chargers. ESPN's 
"GameDay" will focus on Butts today, as HBO did earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Simpson chats with Beathard, "the smartest man in the NFL," this morning 
on NBC's "NFL Live." Next Sunday night the Chargers and Seahawks will meet at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium in a nationally televised contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the way the league is, and the way the division is, we finally got 
ourselves in a position where each week it's the most important game," Beathard 
said. "For obvious reasons this is the most important game we've played this 
year. And if we win, next week will be the most important we play." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs played the "most important" game of their season two weeks ago in 
Kansas City against the Raiders and prevailed, 9-7. They stayed at home last 
week and, on the final play of the game, surrendered a 25-yard touchdown pass 
to Seattle that allowed the Seahawks to steal a 17-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
What might have looked like a walkover a month ago now becomes a matter of 
self-preservation for the Chiefs. They are 5-4, and after today, four of their 
final six games will be played on the road, including contests against the 
Raiders, Chicago Bears and Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent quite a bit of time looking over what is probably going to be the 
best team -- visiting team -- to come to Arrowhead Stadium," Kansas City Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have won four of their last five games and have allowed an average 
of 8.5 points a game in their four victories. They have the league's 
fifth-ranked defense, but in the last month only Miami has given up fewer 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
This is not good news for Kansas City quarterback Steve DeBerg. Even when the 
Chargers have been at their worst, they have saved their best for the man who 
tutored Joe Montana and John Elway. Against the Chargers, DeBerg is 0-4 as a 
starter, with five touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had good success against some guys and there are others who just tear us 
apart," Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "And we've played well 
against DeBerg. It almost becomes a mind-set where the guys think they can do 
well against a particular guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers intercepted seven of DeBerg's passes in two meetings last season. 
But check his pulse: DeBerg has not thrown an interception in his last 111 pass 
attempts. In eight of his nine games this season, he has failed to throw an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, DeBerg also has thrown 66 passes without recording a touchdown. The 
Chiefs have gone 10 quarters without locating the end zone, and they have 
averaged 10.6 points in their past three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' Billy Joe Tolliver, like DeBerg, has avoided the interception. He 
has thrown 121 passes without an interception and trails only Dan Fouts' 168 in 
team history for most attempts without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"For each of these quarterbacks it might be the biggest test each has had this 
year," Beathard said. "Both teams are going to try and run, but both teams have 
attacking defenses. So both quarterbacks will be under similar pressure. Now 
does that guy handle it better than this guy? That's what we're going to find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs will run at the Chargers with a 260-pound mountain, Okoye, and 
relieve him with 240-pound Barry Word. Okoye and Word, according to the Elias 
Sports Bureau, are the heaviest running back duo in NFL history -- 14 pounds 
heavier than the league's No. 3 all-time heavyweights, Butts and Rod Bernstine, 
who sustained a hamstring injury last week and is listed as questionable for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Butts and Bernstine have combined for 1,220 yards this season, leading all duos 
in the league, but right behind them are Okoye and Word with 1,063 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking in the mirror when you look at these teams," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will pass only when they have to or when they believe they have the 
opposition duped into thinking they will run. Both teams have big-play 
receivers in Anthony Miller and Stephone Paige. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have premier pass rushers. Linebacker Derrick Thomas, who set an NFL 
record last week with seven sacks, tops the league with 15. The Chargers 
counter with Burt Grossman (8 1/2), Leslie O'Neal (7 1/2) and Lee Williams (5 
1/2). 
</P>
<P>
And both teams are capable of crafting a victory via special teams. The Chiefs 
have blocked five punts this season; the Chargers have returned a punt for a 
touchdown, and rank No. 1 across the board on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"With this type of game, the steadier you play the better off you will be," 
Coach Dan Henning said. "The team that gets the big play, that will be the 
difference."

STANFORD GETS ITS REVENGE FOR THE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
It's known simply as The Play, Cal's five-lateral kickoff return for a 
touchdown through the Stanford band, which gave the Golden Bears a 25-20 
victory over Stanford in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
While Stanford's dramatic 27-25 win in Saturday's 93rd Big Game, which came on 
John Hopkins' 39-yard field goal as time expired, wasn't as bizarre, it was 
almost as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember The Play and I guess you could call this The Play II," said 
Stanford running back Glyn Milburn, who rushed for 196 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 25-18, Stanford drove 87 yards to a touchdown, with quarterback Jason 
Palumbis hitting split end Ed McCaffrey with a 19-yard touchdown pass with 12 
seconds remaining to cut the score to 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
Then it got strange. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal went for a two-point conversion to win the game, but defensive 
back John Hardy intercepted Palumbis' pass in the end zone and Cal's fans, 
thinking the game was over, engulfed the Memorial Stadium field. Hardy ran 
through the crowd, exchanging high-fives with rooters on his way to the tunnel 
that leads to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
But 12 seconds remained. 
</P>
<P>
After the crowd was cleared, Cal was assessed a 15-yard penalty for delay of 
game by referee Pat Flood, who had earlier threatened to award Stanford the 
two-point conversion unless the field was cleared of fans who had left the 
stands in anticipation of a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule states that if the team, which includes substitutes, band members and 
cheerleaders, come on the field, a penalty can be assessed," Flood said. "We 
can't penalize the crowd. Cal had quite a few players on the field and the 
coaches were trying to hold them back. Some of them were all the way over near 
the Stanford sideline. They thought the game was over for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
While it can be argued that The Play wouldn't have been possible without the 
Stanford band, which had spilled onto the field during the chaotic five-lateral 
kickoff return, Cal Coach Bruce Snyder refused to blame Cal's overzealous fans 
for contributing to the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what the crowd was going to do," Snyder said. "But I just want 
to go on record as saying that over the course of this year, fan support, 
particularly in the student section, has been outstanding. In a way, they get 
credit for the improvement of Cal's football team and I appreciate the hell out 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off from the 50, instead of the 35, Hopkins dribbled a kick along the 
right sideline. Although several Cal players had a chance to recover, Stanford 
defensive back Kevin Scott covered it at the Cal 37 with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Scott admitted later that he was out of bounds when he recovered the kick. 
</P>
<P>
"My feet were out of bounds, but my knees were in bounds," Scott said. "But 
it's too late to give it back. There's no instant replay in college football." 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis, who passed for 253 yards and one touchdown, threw an incomplete pass 
on first down, but Cal was penalized for roughing the passer when nose guard 
John Belli hit Palumbis after he had released the ball, giving Stanford a first 
down at the Cal 22 with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to tell right now until I look at the films," Belli said of the 
call. "I'm an aggressive player and it was an obvious passing down. I was just 
trying to get some heat on the quarterback. I didn't realize it was late when I 
hit him. I was going full steam. I didn't really hit him, I sort of ran through 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder thought it was a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a good call," Snyder said. "Whether legitimate or not, the officials 
determine that. The referee's job is to protect the quarterback and he made his 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis disagreed, saying, "The call came immediately, so I think it was a 
good call." 
</P>
<P>
The 15-yard penalty moved Stanford into field-goal range for Hopkins, who had 
made kicks of 26, 29, 47 and 22 yards earlier in the game. So instead of a 
53-yard field goal, Hopkins trotted onto the field and hit a 39-yarder to beat 
the Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was good right away, but it was a tough kick because it was into the 
wind," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green made sure that the Stanford band wouldn't determine 
the outcome of this game, sending extra security guards to police the band and 
ensure that the musicians wouldn't leave the stands until the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my No. 1 security guy make sure the band wasn't on the field, and I had 
my No. 2 security guy make sure no players were on the field because I wasn't 
sure if there was any time left on the clock," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Until it turned into a theater of the absurd, Cal tailbacks Russell White and 
Anthony Wallace dominated the game. 
</P>
<P>
White, who rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, finished the regular season 
with 1,000 yards. Wallace, who gained 99 yards, ended the regular season with 
1,002. 
</P>
<P>
White gave Cal a 25-18 lead when he scored his second touchdown on an 
eight-yard run with 6:03 left to cap an 88-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
After Cal forced Stanford to punt on the ensuing series, it appeared that the 
Golden Bears (6-4-1 4-3-1) would run out the final 4:16. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal was unable to kill the clock, punting to Stanford (5-6, 4-4) with two 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
After taking over at his 13, Palumbis made a brilliant play to keep the drive 
alive on fourth and six at the Stanford 35, hitting wide receiver Chris Walsh 
with a 17-yard pass over the middle with 56 seconds left. Six plays later, 
Palumbis connected with McCaffrey for the touchdown.

IT'S NO HOLIDAY FOR ARIZONA; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS' REJECTION OF KING DAY CAUSES MORE THAN JUST A LOT OF HOT AIR IN THE 
STATE

<P>
Is the caller there? 
</P>
<P>
The lines are jammed at KFYI, an all-talk radio station here. Callers from 
around the state are waiting in an electronic line to talk to show host Bob 
Mohan. And Mohan has no doubt as to today's topic. It's the same thing callers 
have been talking about since the election Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Dave from Glendale: "How dare anybody ask me, when I'm done voting, to justify 
my vote, to prove it. Let alone, have anybody tell me I have made a mistake and 
I might do better with another chance. I think King is a joke. I don't want any 
day, that I have anything to say about, associated with him." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy from Phoenix: "I'm sick and tired of talking about Martin Luther King. We 
voted and let's get on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
One woman calls to say there is no "prejudicism" in Arizona. A man calls 
demanding to know why sports and politics should be mixed. Another caller 
suggests a holiday for Sammy Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The talk-show host is working a crossword puzzle. The phone bank in front of 
him sparkles with red blinking lights, each light an Arizonan hopping mad. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis from Scottsdale: "In your face Tagliabue. Tuesday's vote was the state's 
finest hour. We would have never caved in to the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Mohan is nodding, nodding. He sighs and says, "And the rest of the country 
thinks we're a bunch of Neanderthal apes dragging our knuckles." 
</P>
<P>
It has been like this since Arizona voters failed to support a proposition that 
would have created a state paid holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. That the measure failed narrowly, 50.8% to 49.2%, is not 
the point. That Arizona already sets aside a day to commemorate King and the 
civil rights movement doesn't seem to be the point, either. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that Arizona has become the focus of the worst kind of national 
attention: the "60 Minutes," "Geraldo" kind of attention. The butt-of-jokes, 
Johnny Carson monologue kind. The point is, also, that Arizonans are angry, 
hurt and not at all ready to accept their title as a racist symbol of the 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of this, the NFL is considering relocating the 1993 Super Bowl 
from Phoenix, at Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's recommendation. The Fiesta Bowl 
will not be moved, but its organizers had to scramble for teams to play in it. 
College athletic recruiters are already rehearsing their anti-Arizona pitches 
to recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Conventions are avoiding the state, and other states, California in particular, 
are actively wooing Arizona's tourist business. Think of the state as a dying 
creature with its neighbors, like vultures, perched on its borders. 
</P>
<P>
To all this Arizonans are saying, via radio call-in shows, letters to the 
editor and bumper stickers, "Leave us alone! We are mad as hell and we are not 
going to take it anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a holiday to honor King has confounded the state legislature since 
debate began in 1975. The Arizona legislature has voted against a paid King 
holiday 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for a King holiday in Arizona has a long and often-misunderstood 
history. In recent years the controversy reached a boiling point in May of 
1986, when then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt proclaimed the third Monday in January a 
paid state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6, 1986, Gov.-elect Evan Mecham announced that he would rescind the 
paid holiday, saying the state attorney general had ruled Babbitt's 
proclamation unlawful. Upon taking office, Mecham declared an unpaid Sunday 
commemoration called the King/Civil Rights Day. 
</P>
<P>
That act set in motion events that at first bewildered and then angered 
Arizonans. Although Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana are the only three 
states that don't have a paid state holiday honoring King, people here are 
quick to point out that 21 cities in the state have some form of observance for 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Their protests, though, were not enough to blunt national condemnation and 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona legislature, aware of the state's deteriorating image, acted and on 
Sept. 21, 1989, approved a swap -- a paid state holiday for King and the 
elimination of a paid Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, didn't solve anything: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outraged Italian-Americans swung into action, calling for the restoration 
of the holiday honoring Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three days later, a Tempe architect, Julian Sanders, began a petition drive 
to put the King-Columbus matter on the ballot. The group obtained enough 
signatures and the King Day enacted by the legislature was put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In October, Sanders, a Mormon, sent a letter to a church official calling 
King a "Communist anti-Christ" who was "a liar, adulterer and thief." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In March, Phoenix was awarded the 1993 Super Bowl. Business leaders 
pressured legislators to pass some kind of King holiday. On May 16, the Arizona 
legislature agreed to a paid King holiday and restored the Columbus Day 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In August, Mecham spearheaded a successful referendum drive to put that 
legislative action on the ballot. The law was put on hold. Again. 
</P>
<P>
Many who voted against the King holiday said they did so for economic reasons. 
Arizona has 10 paid state holidays. The cost of adding another is estimated at 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
But to the chagrin of many, the failure of the King-day measure may cost the 
state millions more in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitor's Bureau, 
the fallout from the pre-election King controversy -- dating back to Mecham's 
rescinding of the holiday -- has been enormous. Since 1987, the Phoenix area 
has lost 58 conventions, representing 46,000 visitors and an estimated $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
To get an idea of the potential economic impact on Arizona, keep in mind that 
the figures represent losses in one city, in one segment of the economy, before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Arizona's No. 2 industry, behind manufacturing. And it is tourism 
that would be hardest hit by consumer boycotts and negative images of the 
state. Phoenix alone makes $3 billion a year on tourism and relies on a 
successful Fiesta Bowl for additional income. The New Year's Day game last year 
generated $30 million statewide. 
</P>
<P>
And although the Fiesta Bowl will be played, as scheduled, in neighboring 
Tempe, organizers have little doubt that revenues will be down. 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, the threat of state boycotts has snowballed. Among the 
possible boycotters: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL. The 1993 Super Bowl will likely be moved from Phoenix. Lost 
revenue is estimated at $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NBA. Phoenix is a candidate for the 1994 All-Star game but is not 
likely to get it under the current circumstances. In 1987, the NBA pulled its 
annual general meetings out of Phoenix because of the King-holiday controversy. 
NBA Commissioner David Stern said last week that he doubted the league would 
hold major events in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't seem to be a place that we would find particularly 
hospitable," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Harlem Globetrotters, who canceled two scheduled games in the state, 
with a potential loss of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some issues dollars can't measure," a team official said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Martin Stone, a businessman from Lake Placid, N.Y. Stone has given up his 5 
1/2-year attempt to get a major league baseball expansion team for Phoenix. He 
has spent $2 million on the effort but said, in light of the King vote, the 
National League would not belikely to put a team in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The entertainment industry. A widespread boycott is expected. The state has 
already been boycotted by such performers as Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Al 
Jarreau, Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder, who either canceled appearances or 
said they would not perform in Arizona until a paid King holiday was a fact. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups, such as U2, Kool and the Gang, and Peter, Paul and Mary performed 
but protested by donating some concert proceeds to the campaign to recall 
Mecham. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The National League of Cities. That group, whose convention is expected to 
bring $6.9 million to Phoenix, will decide next month whether to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of similarly-sized conventions are expected to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
By most measures, it was a tough election for Arizonans. Propositions 301 and 
302 were among a jumble of 13 measures on the ballot. Combinations of yes and 
no votes on the propositions presented to voters various possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approve both measures and the one with the most affirmative votes wins. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approve Proposition 301 and reject 302, creating a paid King Day and 
eliminating a paid Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approve Proposition 302 and reject 301, creating a paid King Day and 
preserving the paid Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reject both and retain the status quo, a paid Columbus Day and no paid King 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
(Arizona does not follow the federal model that combines Washington and Lincoln 
birthdays into Presidents Day, thus adding another holiday.) 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of no one, the results of a poll conducted a week after the 
election revealed that voters had been confused. 
</P>
<P>
Polling organizations are perhaps the one business group not considering 
pulling out of Arizona. To the contrary, their business is booming. 
</P>
<P>
One poll released last week to much attention was one that suggested that the 
NFL's threat to move the Super Bowl if the King measure failed had caused a 
large number of Arizonans to change their yes vote to a no. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide poll, conducted by Earl DeBerge, concluded that 60,000 voters 
shifted their vote on Proposition 302 after hearing Greg Gumbel's report on 
CBS-TV's "The NFL Today" on the Sunday before the election that the NFL was 
poised to pull the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
According to DeBerge, 63% of those polled who had changed their vote from yes 
to no said they had done so because they "Resented the National Football League 
threat to move the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Another pollster, Michael O'Neil, reached the same conclusion, reporting, "We 
believe that there can be no doubt that (without the) impact of the CBS sports 
report two days before the election that Proposition 302 would have passed." 
</P>
<P>
The perception of a last-minute threat from the NFL is one explanation for 
still other polls that showed the King Day measure passing with ease. One 
factor to consider -- people often lie to pollsters and give what they think 
will be the acceptable answer. 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Neil: "The recent examples of people not telling the truth in polls has 
been with racial issues." 
</P>
<P>
So many Arizona voters had no intention of voting for the holiday but told 
parades of pollsters they were planning to out of fear of being labeled 
racists? 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the rallying point of racism," said Lincoln Ragsdale, a Phoenix 
businessman and civil rights activist. Arizona's blacks make up only 3% of the 
state's population. "The NFL gave people the excuse they had been looking for 
to vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, a fellow goes out on a Saturday night packing a gun. He walks around, 
brushing up against people to start a fight. He wants to use the gun. Someone 
punches him and he finally has the excuse he needs to shoot someone. The NFL 
threat only gave people the reason they needed to vote no." 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, there is no doubt that outrage over Tagliabue's statements 
was widespread. A Mesa man sued the NFL and CBS Friday, accusing them of 
violating state laws prohibiting "changing the vote of an elector by corrupt 
means or inducement." 
</P>
<P>
Mecham said the CBS report was planted by the "power brokers" of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham, who held a news conference Thursday to announce the creation of the 
Preserve Our Vote Legal Defense Fund, railed against the NFL and professional 
sports in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to grovel at the feet of the NFL and the NBA and all the 
alphabet put together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham said Tagliabue was "guilty of extortion." 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl likes to bill itself as the bowl game that extends the warmest 
hospitality to its teams. That will be amplified this year, as Fiesta Bowl 
officials will no doubt lavish the teams with remarkable levels of kindness and 
Western hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
After a scramble -- and a rejection from Notre Dame and Virginia -- the Fiesta 
Bowl will pit No. 20 Louisville against the Southeastern Conference runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to offset King Day criticism, Fiesta officials plan a pregame ceremony 
honoring the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, a halftime presentation 
honoring King and the civil rights movement, the establishment of a $100,000 
Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship fund for each participating team, and the 
establishment of a scholarship fund to benefit local students in the name of 
King. 
</P>
<P>
A Fiesta Bowl official, asked if these steps had been taken to soothe national 
opinion, said, "There is no appeasement in the recipe whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Mecham, whose political lives seem endless, is at the center of the King Day 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A former car dealer, Mecham's political lives have seemed endless. He has run 
for governor six times. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, he frequently got in trouble for blurting out whatever came into 
his head. For instance, he defended the use of the word pickaninny to describe 
black children in a history book used in Arizona schools. He joked about 
Japanese becoming "round-eyed" with delight after seeing the state's golf 
courses. And he told a Jewish group that the United States is a Christian 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Among Mecham's 147 appointees were the governor's education adviser, who said 
that teachers have no right to contradict parents who tell their children the 
Earth is flat, and an elderly woman he appointed to the State Board of 
Education who lacks a college degree and considers the equal rights amendment a 
lesbian plot. 
</P>
<P>
Given his history, few state leaders are thrilled that Mecham has taken the 
lead in the anti-King-Day drive. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, damage control here has been problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Mofford, the current governor, said on national television that she felt 
Arizona was somewhat a racist state. A sports columnist in Tucson suggested 
that the NFL's Phoenix Cardinals offer a Klan Night promotion with the marching 
band at halftime honoring former Gov. Mecham by spelling out pickaninny. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Mofford called a special session of the legislature to organize a 
gubernatorial runoff election, she was saying she might ask lawmakers to put 
together a two-thirds-vote requirement to override the people's vote and 
install a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the day was out, a group had formed, held a news conference, and 
announced that it would circulate recall petitions against any legislator who 
voted for a King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Few can say just what the impact the controversy will have on the state, other 
than that the damage may be limitless. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale, the Phoenix civil rights activist, summed up the state's image this 
way: "Arizona is the South Africa of the United States, like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Mecham, ever the smiling optimist, saw the fallout in another light. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it the other way," he said. "There are just a lot of people across 
this country that say, 'Boy, there's a state for you. There's Arizona. They're 
not a racist state. They're a great state. And they have got guts enough to 
make up their own mind on something. I believe I'll go live in that state.' "

GUESSING GAME IS THE KEY; 
</P>
<P>
USC: BY ANTICIPATING WHAT MADDOX WOULD DO, TROJAN DEFENDERS COME UP WITH TWO 
TOUCHDOWNS ON INTERCEPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When USC sophomore safety Stephon Pace looks back to his first game against 
UCLA freshman quarterback Tommy Maddox, he will remember Saturday's showdown at 
the Rose Bowl as a guessing game filled with big plays. 
</P>
<P>
On nearly every offensive play for the Bruins, Maddox tried to outguess Pace 
and the Trojan secondary by audibilizing at the line of scrimmage after looking 
at USC's defensive coverage. He passed for 409 yards and three touchdowns, but 
two plays on which he guessed wrong cost the Bruins in USC's 45-42 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox's first mistake came on the game's second play from scrimmage when he 
attempted to throw a screen pass to tailback Brian Brown. Figuring that the 
Trojans were in their regular zone pass defense, Maddox did not see Pace, who 
stepped in front of his pass and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought that we were in a two-deep coverage or that we were in a blitz," 
said Pace, who calls signals for the USC secondary. "I was just standing right 
there when he dumped the ball off." 
</P>
<P>
On the play, Pace was in a special "robber" position and not in his normal free 
safety spot. It was a coverage USC had in its game plan to confuse Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that they would come into the game throwing," Pace said. "After their 
win against Washington last week, we knew that Maddox would be putting it up." 
</P>
<P>
After Pace's interception, Maddox would complete 18 of his next 25 passes for 
265 yards, including a 47-yard touchdown to Sean LaChapelle, in the next three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
However, on his first pass of the fourth quarter, Maddox made his second major 
mistake of the game, again at the hands of Pace. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bruins trailing, 24-21, Maddox audibilized an out pattern to split end 
Reggie Moore. Maddox saw USC freshman cornerback Jason Oliver in man-to-man 
coverage on Moore but did not notice Pace, who deflected the pass through the 
hands of Moore and into the arms of Oliver. He returned it 34 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"On the sidelines before the play, (Oliver) told me that if Maddox thinks that 
he is playing off, (Maddox) will throw an out pass," Pace said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I tried to do was disguise it and then run hard into the flat and I was 
able to get a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, who also returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown last week 
against Oregon State, said the Trojans were simply successful in outguessing 
Maddox on his touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though he was passing for a lot of yards," Oliver said, "we did not go 
out there depressed on every series. We were excited because we knew we had a 
chance to make a big play. We had fun in trying to outguess him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bobby April, USC's coach of defensive backs: "No coach ever wants to give 
up 409 yards passing, but I am really happy with how our secondary played. We 
did score 14 points on defense, and the bottom line is that we won the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for us was how we were able to disguise our coverages against Maddox. 
Pace played really well for us in making those big plays and calling our 
defenses. He has gotten better in his knowledge of the game throughout the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
USC used five defensive backs for most of the game in trying to stop receiver 
Scott Miller, who caught eight passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
USC cornerback Calvin Holmes said the Bruins' shotgun formation gave the 
Trojans problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we got the better of them, but (Maddox) picked us apart with us 
playing so much zone out of the shotgun," Holmes said. "What we tried to do was 
move into our real coverage after he made his audible, which helped us on our 
two interceptions."

Texas quarterback Peter Gardere tied a school record by passing for four 
touchdowns as the No. 7 Longhorns stayed on course for the Cotton Bowl with a 
38-10 Southwest Conference victory over Texas Christian Saturday at Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, 6-1 overall and 6-0 in the SWC, beat the Horned Frogs for the 23rd 
consecutive time. The Longhorns can clinch the conference championship and a 
trip to the Cotton Bowl by defeating Baylor at Waco, Tex., next Saturday. TCU 
(5-5, 3-4) lost its fourth consecutive game after a 5-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think they're one of the country's top five teams," TCU Coach Jim 
Wacker said of the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
Gardere completed 18 of 37 passes for 269 yards. He connected on touchdown pass 
plays of 43, seven, five and 55 yards to tie the school record held by Clyde 
Littlefield, Randy McEachern and Rick McIvor. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Gardere's scoring passes came in a span of 53 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Cash caught a five-yard touchdown pass -- his second of the game -- with 
12:42 left. And after Stanley Richard intercepted a pass by Matt Vogler, 
Gardere hooked up with Mike Davis on a 55-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler, who had an NCAA record 690 yards passing two weeks ago, played with a 
separated left shoulder, his nonthrowing shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor 17, Rice 16 -- The Bears (6-3-1, 5-1-1) kept alive their hopes for the 
Cotton Bowl with the narrow SWC victory over the Owls (5-6, 3-5) at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Rice wide receiver Nigel Codrington, the SWC high-jump champion, leaped above 
two Baylor defenders on a desperation fourth-down pass with 1:03 left and then 
struggled the final three yards into the end zone to complete a 34-yard scoring 
play that pulled the Owls to within one point. Rice then failed on a two-point 
conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Owls missed achieving their first winning season since 1963. They also lost 
starting quarterback Donald Hollas to a knee injury in the first quarter and 
struggled offensively for much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Strait scored on runs of two yards and one yard and Jeff Ireland added a 
field goal in the first half as Baylor built a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Strait's first touchdown, with 5:28 left in the first quarter, was set up by an 
interception by Michael McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech 62, SMU 7 -- Anthony Lynn rushed for two touchdowns and Rodney 
Blackshear caught two touchdown passes in an SWC game at Lubbock, Tex., as the 
Red Raiders (4-7, 3-5) handed Southern Methodist (1-9, 0-7) its ninth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Raiders moved the ball effortlessly, racking up 310 yards of offense 
and a 42-7 lead by halftime. Tech scored 35 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After losing a fumble on their first drive, the Red Raiders scored on their 
next nine possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Tech's defense stifled SMU's run-and-shoot offense, sacking quarterback Mike 
Romo six times, including two by Marcus Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Romo completed nine of 16 passes for 97 yards and caught a touchdown pass on a 
trick play. But he threw two costly interceptions, including a 38-yard return 
for a touchdown by Tech's Sammy Walker late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders held the Mustangs to six rushing yards in 23 carries through three 
quarters. Tech quarterbacks Jason Rattan and Robert Hall took turns guiding the 
Raiders on touchdown drives of 98, 58, 43, 92, 80 and 56 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M 20, Arkansas 16 -- The Aggies (7-2-1, 4-1-1) won an SWC game at 
Fayetteville, Ark., for the first time since 1976 and dealt the Razorbacks 
(2-8, 0-7) their seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The last Arkansas team to lose six consecutive games was former Coach Frank 
Broyles first team in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bucky Richardson scored on a 10-yard touchdown run in the third 
quarter to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa 20, Montana State 2 -- Mark Brus rushed for 143 yards and a touchdown and 
Chris Hughley scored two touchdowns as the Golden Hurricane defeated the 
Bobcats at Tulsa, Okla.

BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP;

<P>
MISSOURI RECEIVER HAULS IN THE RECORDS

<P>
Missouri wide receiver Linzy Collins had a record-breaking performance Saturday 
during the Tigers' 31-21 victory over Kansas in a Big Eight Conference game at 
Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, a senior, caught nine passes for a conference-record 229 yards and two 
touchdowns and also set several school records as Missouri finished 4-7 overall 
and 2-5 in the Big Eight. Kansas finished 3-6-1 and 2-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Collins set a Missouri season record with 56 catches, breaking the mark of 49 
set by Herbert Johnson in 1985. Collins' 229 yards erased the one-game school 
mark of 193 he set last year against Kansas, and broke the Big Eight standard 
of 222. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who last week became Missouri's career receiving leader, teamed with 
freshman quarterback Phil Johnson to score on pass plays of 50 and 10 yards. He 
also set up two other scores with gains of 71 and 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
His 71-yarder preceded Ronnell Kayhill's seven-yard touchdown run on the next 
play and gave the Tigers a 24-7 lead with 13:48 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
There was confusion among the game statisticians over whether to count Collins' 
last pass, which went for a two-yard loss. The catch was originally not counted 
because of a penalty on the play. But several hours later, media outlets were 
advised that the catch and the minus-two yards would count. 
</P>
<P>
The change shaved two yards off Collins' totals but gave him complete 
possession of the school mark for career receptions with 102. 
</P>
<P>
His Missouri career record stands at 1,760 yards, erasing the mark of 1,491 
held by Mel Gray. 
</P>
<P>
His season total of 957 yards also is a Missouri record. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State 25, Iowa State 17 -- Gerald Hudson rushed for a career-high 264 
yards and Cary Blanchard kicked a career-best four field goals to lead the 
Cowboys (4-7, 2-5) over the Cyclones (4-6-1, 2-4-1) in a Big Eight finale at 
Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson, a senior, carried 27 times and scored on touchdown runs of 18 yards and 
one yard in improving upon his previous best of 255 yards against Missouri 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard kicked field goals of 24, 23, 39, and 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson broke a 58-yard run to the Iowa State nine on the Cowboys' third play of 
the game. That set up Blanchard's 24-yard field goal and the Cowboys never 
trailed.

MCGWIRE PASSES FOR 530 YARDS IN VICTORY;

SAN DIEGO STATE: AZTECS BEAT NEW MEXICO, 40-34, AND KEEP THEIR SLIM BOWL HOPES 
FLICKERING.

<P>
San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire completed 33 passes for a career-high 
530 yards, six short of the school record set by Todd Santos against Stanford 
in 1987, and led the Aztecs to a 40-34 victory over New Mexico before 7,868 at 
University Stadium Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Miller, Aztec athletic director, said San Diego State, 5-4 overall and 4-2 
in the Western Athletic Conference, is still one of the teams under 
consideration for a berth in the Dec. 29 Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State is apparently in the running with North Carolina, Temple and 
Louisiana Tech for a berth against a Southwest Conference opponent, probably 
Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
Against New Mexico (2-10, 1-6), McGwire spread around his 49 pass attempts, 
with three Aztec receivers getting at least 100 yards. He threw two touchdown 
passes to Jimmy Raye, and Patrick Rowe caught six passes for 131 yards. Rowe 
tied a school record with seven consecutive games of 100 or more receiving 
yards. The NCAA record is eight, set by Tulsa's Howard Twilley in 1965 and tied 
by Fresno State's Henry Ellard in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe now has 1,129 yards this season, seventh on the Aztecs' all-time single 
season list. 
</P>
<P>
He also became the 10th receiver in SDSU history to surpass the 1,000-yard mark 
in a season with his first catch of the game, a 34-yard reception on the last 
play of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Arey caught eight passes for 150 yards, and Raye had eight receptions 
for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs rushed for 158 yards and finished with 688 total yards, 
third-highest in school history. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like it . . . we were so inconsistent," McGwire said. "We were 
inconsistent throughout the whole game. We had an off day. To overcome that and 
post a victory like this . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Aztecs' first road victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 10-7, the Aztecs scored touchdowns on three possessions in a row and 
led at the half, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos pulled to 31-28 when Marcus Goodloe passed 43 yards to Eric Morgan 
for a touchdown to cap a 67-yard, four-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs answered with a 23-yard field goal by Andy Trakas. With 11:08 to 
play, Tommy Booker capped a 67-yard, nine-play drive with a five-yard touchdown 
that put the Aztecs ahead, 40-28. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Morris intercepted McGwire's pass with 4:13 to play and returned it to the 
Aztec 35 and, three plays later, Goodloe passed 18 yards to Morgan for a 
touchdown. A two-point conversion attempt failed.

DOLPHINS REVIVED BY THEIR DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: ROOKIES, CASTOFFS MAKE MIAMI NO. 1 HEADING INTO MONDAY NIGHT'S GAME 
AGAINST L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You probably remember the No-Names and Killer B's, but in recent years the 
Miami Dolphin defense has pretty much been all fins when it came to tackling. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in 1990, comes an improbable turnaround: a defense that cracks and 
crunches. One that pounds. The Miami Pound Machine? If the nickname fits, use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins finished 24th overall on defense in 1989. Some perspective: A 
much-maligned Ram group, one that got Christmas cards from opposing 
quarterbacks near and far, finished three slots better at 21st. 
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of a triumphant return to "Monday Night Football" against the 
Raiders, Miami Coach Don Shula offers the nation not the flashiest sun-tanned 
quarterback, but rather the NFL's No. 1 defense. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup is overloaded with castoffs and overachievers who have somehow 
pulled together to complete a Dolphin jig-saw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been some things that have fit together for us," Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
So who are these "superstars?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, a ninth-round draft choice, Jeff Cross, leads the team in sacks with 10. 
Starting inside linebacker, Cliff Odom, was picked up as a Plan B free agent 
when Indianapolis left him unprotected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Starting left outside linebacker David Griggs is a free agent who spent most of 
1989 on the developmental squad after New Orleans had released him. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Oglesby, a rookie, is starting at nose tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The first pass rusher off the bench, linebacker E.J. Junior, was picked up on 
Plan B after his career was presumed over as a Phoenix Cardinal in 1988. Junior 
has five sacks, his highest total since a 9 1/2-sack season in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran outside linebacker Hugh Green, a Medicare project in 1985 after an 
injury-plagued career in Tampa Bay, has remained sound enough to display his 
considerable talent in his 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
There are two other important factors in the resurgence of the Dolphin defense: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim McKyer. In San Francisco, he was a talented, hotheaded cornerback who 
was deemed more trouble than he was worth. So, April 23 the 49ers traded him to 
the Dolphins for second- and 11th-round draft choices. McKyer has since 
solidified the team's cornerback position. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Offerdahl. The all-pro linebacker missed the first six games of 1989 
in a contract dispute and his absence hurt. This year, he is back, better than 
ever, and leads the team with 58 tackles. He is one of the league's best 
linebackers against the run and has the numbers to prove it. The Dolphins 
ranked 25th against the run in 1989. This season they're No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the defense, however, has been set by the hard-working Cross, a 
no-name defensive end from the University of Missouri who has taken average 
athletic ability to new heights. He currently ranks second in the AFC in sacks 
with 10, and has already equaled his sack total of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Shula said he would like to take credit for Cross, but you don't wait nine 
rounds for star players. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we known, we wouldn't have waited to take him where we took him in the 
draft," Shula said. "This guy is very, very serious. He's willing to give 
everything he has. Some athletes are that way; some athletes don't do more than 
they have to."

THE GLORY OF COWBOY GAME HAS FADED; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: EACH TEAM HAS ONLY THREE VICTORIES HEADING INTO TODAY'S MATCHUP AT 
ANAHEIM STADIUM.

<P>
Where do the Rams go from 3-6? 
</P>
<P>
They have to try to rev it up yet another weekend, try to persuade themselves 
another time that yes, they still have something to play for this season -- 
even if it may only be that old standby, pride, against a team that no longer 
makes you goose-pimply. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, it would have been the glamour matchup of the day: Rams vs. 
Cowboys. Winner vs. winner. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it is merely another game between teams with six victories combined 
and perhaps only the 1991 draft to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys (3-7), with 27th-rated offense in the league, haven't scored a 
touchdown in November and never really expected to reach the playoffs this 
season. The 3-6 Rams, the 26th-ranked defense, are holding onto their gaudy 
preseason playoff aspirations only by the grace of the NFC's rampant mediocrity 
and fading memories of their playoff run in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We know where we stand," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said. "There's not really 
much light at the end of that tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think right now we're trying to end this season the best way we can, and 
that's winning football games. We'd rather go out on a winning note. Say we 
ended the season winning. Then we'd go into next year as winners, not losers. I 
think that's important." 
</P>
<P>
At least last week the Rams had the adrenaline rush of playing a superior 
football team to push them. The Giants raise pulse levels (they also beat the 
Rams, 31-7), and next week's opponents, the San Francisco 49ers, are always 
good for winning Super Bowls and energizing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's quite the same focus (with Dallas) as there is with the 
Giants," Coach John Robinson said. "But I think we're practicing well. I think 
we want to get back playing. I don't see any retreat or any withdrawal from 
that at all. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) I've been unable to figure out some of our (ups and downs), so I say 
that with some trepidation." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams can try to adapt to the role of spoilers next week. This week, it is 
the Cowboys, and the only thing the Rams can possibly spoil is the lingering 
hope that they could suddenly rise up and jump back into the playoff hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't write the Rams off yet," quarterback Jim Everett said. "Granted, 
we've had a lot of things go against us. We haven't played our best football 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to realize that last year we had a lot of games that were very 
close that we did win. We've been very unfortunate this year, just not having 
those things go for us as much." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's game against Dallas was a case in point. The Rams went into Texas 
Stadium with an 8-4 record and barely beat the 1-11 Cowboys with a second-half 
rally, 35-31. Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman threw four touchdown passes, but 
was stopped in the final minutes inside the Ram 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
This year, although the Dallas defense has played better, Aikman has been 
openly critical about the direction of the offense, and was told at least once 
by offensive coordinator David Shula to temper both his on-field remarks to 
teammates and his off-field comments to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Four times already this season, the Cowboys have been held without a touchdown 
-- compared to five times during their 1-15 season last year -- and they are 
averaging only 12.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie tailback Emmitt Smith, who was used to carrying the ball 30 times a game 
in college, got it six times for 40 yards last week in Dallas' 24-6 loss to the 
49ers, and also raised some questions about the offensive scheme afterward. It 
figures that Smith, who has gained 468 yards in 123 carries this season, will 
see the ball a lot more this week. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such controversy among the Rams, but there are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hurting all of us because we all expected a lot for ourselves," Reed 
said. "It's like a hard swallow, but as you know, life goes on. For us to sit 
here and, whoa, be stunned about what's happened to us, well, Dallas is coming 
to town. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do that, then we've surrendered. We've surrendered and said, 'OK, you 
can have us.' I don't think this football team is a bunch of quitters. We're 
going to hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Everett, who has watched his own usually strong offense score two 
touchdowns in the last three weeks: "We're a very proud unit that wants to play 
this weekend, wants to get back to 4-6 and then we'll continue from there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reed: "I don't think we can take anybody lightly right now. We're not 
better than them at this point, as far as the record is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like last year we went to Dallas and Dallas was the underdog and we 
were highly favored and they made one heck of a game out of it. So just looking 
at it from that standpoint, we were playing a lot better then than we are now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson played down any suggestion that he and quarterback 
Troy Aikman were at odds over the team's offensive philosophy. Aikman told 
Dallas reporters recently that he had been told to keep calmer on the field, 
and it was reported that he and receiver Michael Irvin shouted at one another 
in the locker room last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy is a very competitive individual," Johnson said. "He puts a lot of 
presure on himself and at times gets upset when the offense is not having 
success. At times, he has to be more on an even keel. I think Troy has done 
some good things, especially when you consider that he is in his second year 
and he missed a big portion of last year. So much is dictated by his supporting 
cast, and I think that's true of any quarterback. We've got such an 
inexperienced supporting cast for Troy that things have been inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Ram receiver Henry Ellard is eight receptions away from passing Tom Fears' team 
record of 400.

CATCHING ON 
</P>
<P>
If not for the sure hands of wide receiver Tarrik Brock, Hawthorne might be a 
spectator today instead of a quarterfinalist in the CIF-Southern Section 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brock made two crucial catches Friday night to help the Cougars pull out a 
28-21 victory over Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks in a Division III playoff opener 
at Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Brock's only catches came on the Cougars' game-winning drive in the fourth 
quarter after Notre Dame had tied the score, 21-21. His sliding, 27-yard catch 
inside the left sideline on third-and-seven gave Hawthorne a first down at the 
Notre Dame 33. Six plays later, Brock put his team ahead by catching a 19-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Jamil Williams in the left corner of the end 
zone with 5:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told the quarterback all year, 'Just throw it up there and I'll do the 
rest,' " Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 160-pound senior made a marvelous effort on his first catch. 
Running a pattern toward the sideline, Brock had to come back for a slightly 
underthrown pass and caught the ball while falling on his back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blitz, and (Williams) just threw it up and gave me a chance," he 
said. "Luckily I recovered in time to come back and get the ball. I was almost 
down. It was a big moment." 
</P>
<P>
On the touchdown play, Brock beat double coverage on a corner pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought two guys up and that motivated me," he said. "I just went for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Brock, who plays center field on the Cougar baseball team, has 22 catches for 
nine touchdowns in a run-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTER SPACE 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas was happy to get a victory, but not pleased with 
the way the Cougars frittered away a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing that a lot this year," he said. "We get ahead, but then we 
lose our edge. That's something we're going to have to stop, because if we 
continue to do that we're going to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne had an especially difficult time defending Notre Dame's running game. 
The Knights were successful on misdirection or counter plays. Tailback Setefano 
Malieitulua led Notre Dame with 134 yards on 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work on that," Casillas said. "Our linebackers are quick. What they 
do is move out on the flow right away, and then the counter is open. Wide 
open." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
Four of five South Bay teams heading to the Southern Section Division VIII 
quarterfinals will have home games Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is home against top-seeded Cabrillo of Lompoc, Palos Verdes won a 
coin flip to earn the home site against Bloomington, West Torrance is home 
against third-seeded Temecula Valley and Torrance plays host to second-seeded 
Morningside for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance defeated the Monarchs, 13-12, in the second game of the year, but 
Morningside Coach Ron Tatum doesn't feel revenge will be much of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of felt we'd be playing Torrance in the playoffs," Tatum said. "We're 
just going to go into the game prepared and do what we normally do. Just 
because it's Torrance isn't going to make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, which doesn't have lights at its field, is tentatively scheduled 
to play Bloomington at North Torrance High. It will be the second trip to the 
South Bay for Bloomington, which shut out South Torrance, 17-0, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III, Hawthorne will travel to face Loara of Anaheim in a game 
tentatively scheduled at Glover Stadium in Anaheim. Interestingly, Loara was 
the designated away team in its first-round game against Villa Park, but wound 
up playing at home because Villa Park could not secure a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In Division VII, top-seeded Serra will play at La Mirada, which upset San 
Fernando League champion Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAD ENDING 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills tailback Robert Coulter, the South Bay's leading rusher the past 
two seasons, was forced to sit out most of the Titans' 39-28 loss to Temecula 
Valley on Thursday night because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Coulter, in his last high school game, was limited to nine yards on four 
carries in the Division VIII playoff opener. He came out of the game in the 
second quarter, but made his presence felt on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"He was screaming and yelling and encouraging our guys," Rolling Hills Coach 
Gary Kimbrell said. "If someone went down, he went out on the field and helped 
them. He had a super attitude. He wasn't feeling sorry for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, would have been easy to do. Coulter sprained his ankle Nov. 9 
in a 45-20 loss to rival Palos Verdes and aggravated the injury last Sunday in 
a tragic accident that claimed the life of Rolling Hills sophomore Brady 
Grasinger, 15, a passenger in Coulter's car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sad for (Coulter's high school career) to end like that, but he has a 
great career ahead of him," Kimbrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Coulter, who finished the season rushing for 1,478 yards, is being recruited by 
several major colleges, Kimbrell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
<P>
* Serra running back Jerald Henry became the first South Bay player to surpass 
300 yards rushing in a game this season, gaining 351 yards on 21 carries in a 
34-21 playoff victory over Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* Banning tailback Travis Davis ran for 147 yards on 16 carries in a 54-0 
victory over Narbonne to become the South Bay rushing leader with 1,500 yards 
on 184 carries. 
</P>
<P>
* Carson cornerback Shawn Parnell had two interceptions in a 56-12 victory over 
Washington to give him nine on the season, tops in the area. 
</P>
<P>
* Carson wide receiver Latario Rachal caught touchdown passes of 84 and 68 
yards against Washington to give him a school-record 16 TD receptions for the 
season. The previous record was 15, set last year by Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
* Palos Verdes quarterback Tim King completed 13 of 18 passes for 195 yards and 
four touchdowns in a 45-18 victory over Santa Paula, by far his best day. King 
entered the playoff game having thrown for 428 yards. 
</P>
<P>
* El Segundo was held to minus-two yards rushing in a 21-6 playoff loss to San 
Marino, which gained 254 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OPPOSITES ATTRACT 
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, Carson and Banning are on a collision course to meet in the L.A. 
City 4-A championship game Dec. 14, they are taking different paths. 
</P>
<P>
Banning completed the regular season Friday by rushing for 404 yards on 44 
carries in a 54-0 victory over Narbonne. The Pilots passed for 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, meanwhile, romped past Washington, 56-12, behind 397 yards passing by 
quarterback John Walsh. The Colts ran the ball only once for a yard, the lowest 
single-game rushing total in school history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
* Serra defeated Trabuco Hills, 34-21, to extend its winning streak to 23 games 
overall and five games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
* Narbonne fell to Banning, 54-0, extending its losing streak to 17 games. The 
Gauchos were outscored, 312-33, in 10 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
* Gardena captured its first league title in 16 years by beating Crenshaw, 
15-14, to clinch the Southern League championship. 
</P>
<P>
* Palos Verdes scored 45 points for the second consecutive game in a 45-18 
Division VIII playoff victory over Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, on the emotion of coaching his final game on 
Carson's field Friday: "To be honest, I never even thought about it until 
before the game. I told the players I wanted them to play well because it's the 
last team I'll ever coach on this field. I almost broke up right then. I had to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy, on his team's 45-18 playoff victory over Santa 
Paula: "We had hoped we'd be playing this way after four or five games, but it 
didn't work out... It all starts with the blocking. This was our third game in 
a row with the same offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, on winning the Southern League title with a 4-3 
record, 4-6 overall: "People will say we only won four games, but we chose the 
right four to win. When we were 0-3, some of the kids could have said, 'Hey, 
that's it.' But we stuck it out. It felt good to walk off the field as 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
* Carson outside linebacker Edgar Ta'ase missed his second game in a row with a 
strained knee but is expected back for the Colts' L.A. City 4-A playoff opener 
Nov. 30, Coach Gene Vollnogle said. 
</P>
<P>
* Morningside linebacker Danny Katoa returned to the lineup after missing one 
game with a sprained knee. He led the Monarchs in tackles and had one 
interception in a 20-13 playoff victory over Atascadero. ROB FERNAS AND DAVID 
RAATZ

Flanker Vini Bjazevich's 20-yard touchdown run on a reverse gave the Harbor 
College football team a 24-22 victory over Compton Saturday afternoon at 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Seahawks (5-5) finished with the school's first .500 mark 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We've improved a lot in two years," Harbor Coach Don Weems said. "We won five 
ballgames. Now we want to get to where we win eight or nine every year." 
</P>
<P>
An inspired Compton team was simply trying to finish the season with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (0-10) might have had it if not for two botched plays inside the Harbor 
15-yard line in the first quarter, a fourth-quarter fumble at the Harbor 25 and 
a 29-yard field goal attempt by Heuston Costello that sailed wide with 35 
seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Compton's gutsy effort impressed Weems. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to win," Weems said. "They showed a tremendous amount of courage 
by playing hard through a tough season. We needed them to miss that last field 
goal in order to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor quarterback Glenn Baham, who played with a sprained ankle, completed 
seven of 11 passes for 140 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Seahawk sophomore Bill Harris rushed 24 times for 145 yards, including a 
19-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Bjazevich did the rest. He scored on a 43-yard pass from Baham in the second 
quarter and kicked a 27-yard field goal in the third. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest 33, West L.A. 8 -- L.A. Southwest ended its season with a 
Western State Conference victory over West L.A. at Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars snapped a three-game losing streak and finished the year with a 4-6 
record and 3-6 in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Craig Manigo completed 10 of 17 passes for 132 yards and 
three touchdowns. Freshman wide receiver Mike Stephens caught three passes for 
68 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught a two-point conversion pass. 
</P>
<P>
George Sylvester and David Mack scored Southwest's other touchdowns. Mack 
returned a West L.A. punt 60 yards for his score. IRENE GARCIA

El Toro High School presented a different version of the two-minute offense 
Saturday at Tustin High, one that produced points in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger water polo team scored twice with less than two minutes remaining 
in first half, and J.P. Mathot scored the game-winning goal with 1:54 to play 
as El Toro (25-3) defeated Capistrano Valley, 3-2, in the Southern Section 4-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro will face Long Beach Wilson (22-6) in the final at 8:45 Wednesday night 
at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. Wilson beat Corona del Mar, 8-4, in the other 
semifinal. El Toro will be seeking its first 4-A championship after winning 
consecutive 3-A titles in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have an experience advantage over some teams," Mathot said, "because 
we aren't happy just to be in the finals, but we want to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (23-4) has dropped the past three meetings with El Toro, 
including last year's 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Mathot, who scored 31 goals in his previous five games, went scoreless for the 
first 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense for both teams today was unbelievable," El Toro Coach Ron Stoll 
said. "I thought J.P. was playing well, but he got frustrated because he tried 
to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played lousy today," Mathot said, "but I tried to focus myself to 
do at least one thing right on that last play." 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied, 2-2, and two minutes remaining, Mathot zeroed in when he 
received the ball in the hole. He turned Capistrano Valley defender Dan Hancock 
at the two-meter line, then fired his game-winner past goalie Nick Kittredge. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't crash down on Mathot on that play," Capistrano Valley Coach Don 
Cholodenko said, "but we lost the game because we didn't capitalize on our 
six-on-five advantages." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars went zero for three on the one-man advantages, but El Toro 
converted on two consecutive Capistrano Valley kick-outs, with Greg Craycraft 
and Jason Kneitel scoring, to erase a 2-0 deficit late in the first half.

La Habra High School found some strange new ways to celebrate its second 
consecutive Southern Section 3-A girls' volleyball championship Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
There was Zrinka Kristich, the Highlanders' 6-foot-5 outside hitter, lifting 
Principal Tom Triggs off his feet after he handed her the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Coach Sandy Blumenthal, who held the championship plaque aloft, 
only to let it slip through her fingers and cut her lip. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was another interesting day for the top-seeded Highlanders, who 
raced past third-seeded and previously unbeaten El Modena, 15-7, 15-1, 15-12, 
in the final at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Kristich had 18 kills and middle blocker Missy Clements added 16 as La Habra 
(19-0) extended its two-year winning streak to 41 matches. Middle blocker Marni 
Hichborn led El Modena (18-1) with 14 kills. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra, which needed five games to beat Agoura in last year's final, had 
reason to celebrate. The victory left the Highlanders as Orange County's only 
undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
"This one was just as sweet as last year,"said Blumenthal, who's in her 20th 
year coaching at the school. "Although it is a little more painful." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal really didn't mind the small cut above her lip. After all, she and 
the Highlanders advanced to the state tournament, where they will defend their 
Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the state tournament will provide some competition for La Habra, which 
has played only a few matches that lasted longer than three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in the past three years that El Modena has been swept in 
the 3-A final, having lost to Sunny Hills in the 1988 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena provided little more than target practice for La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Kristich had 10 kills and Clements had eight in the first game as La Habra 
built leads of 8-3 and 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said La Habra's tall front line of Zrinka Kristich, Clements (5-10) 
and Ana Kristich (6-1) caused El Modena problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a big advantage being so tall," Blumenthal said. "But this team also 
has been playing together so long that they work well together."

Long Beach Wilson 8, Corona del Mar 4 -- Three-time defending Division 4-A 
champion Corona del Mar (25-5) is out of the final for the first time since 
1986 after losing at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson will be playing for its first title since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive goals by Wilson in the first 3 minutes 25 seconds of the 
second quarter and the goaltending of Nick Fullerton ended the Sea Kings' 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Vinje, Corona del Mar's assistant coach, said: "We came into the game as 
ready as we were going to be, but our press and counterattack were not executed 
as well as we hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Axton, Ted Simpkins, Brent O'Brien and Austin Weir scored for Corona del 
Mar. BOB BORSUM

Julian Popov stole the ball from the goalie and scored with 1 minute 15 seconds 
left in overtime to help the Costa Mesa High School water polo team defeat Dos 
Pueblos, 14-13, in a Southern Section Division 2-A semifinal Saturday at 
Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot was blocked by the goalie (Brice Daly) and was floating (it) in his 
hands," Popov said. 
</P>
<P>
"I batted the ball out of his hands, and it just floated in for the goal. 
</P>
<P>
After Popov's goal, which gave the Mustangs a 14-12 lead, Dos Pueblos' Adam 
Estrabrook scored on a penalty shot at 1:09. Dos Pueblos (16-10) had possession 
in the final seconds but failed to score when the 35-second shot clock expired. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (18-9), the second-seeded team in Division 2-A, plays top-seeded 
South Pasadena, a 12-11 winner Saturday over Santa Maria, for the championship 
at 4 p.m. Wednesday at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With Costa Mesa trailing Dos Pueblos, 12-11, Corey Delahunt scored in the final 
six seconds of regulation play on a straight-in shot from the pool's midpoint 
to force a three-minute overtime.

Tony Fekete scored six goals for Corona del Mar. Delahunt and Matt Yamashita

TITANS HOLD OFF AUSSIES IN BASKETBALL OPENER

<P>
Cal State Fullerton took the wraps off the 1990-91 basketball season with an 
88-83 exhibition victory over the Illiwarra Hawks, an Australian club team, 
Saturday night at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the victory was a break from dire preseason predictions. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's media day, Big West Conference coaches picked Fullerton for last 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton survived a late run by Illiwarra, letting a 14-point lead midway 
through the second half dwindle to 82-80 with less than two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans didn't panic. Agee Ward made a 10-foot jumper for an 84-80 lead 
with 1:20 to play. Illiwarra's Norman Taylor dribbled off his foot at the other 
end. Wayne Williams made three free throws and Joe Small had one down the 
stretch for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
"What pleased me more than anything else was when someone makes a run at you, 
and you hold them," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "Winning builds 
confidence, helps morale and makes you believe in what you're doing out on the 
practice floor." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had trouble defending Taylor, the Hawks' 6-foot-6, 230-pound center, 
who had a game-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
He had eight points in the final six minutes and was setting up for a short 
jumper when he bounced the ball of his shoe and into Small's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Ward had 21 points off the bench to lead the Titans. Williams, a senior point 
guard who is Fullerton's only returning starter, had a steady opener with 20 
points and eight assists, including a behind-the-head flip to Ward for a dunk 
on a fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Small, from Bolsa Grande High School and College of the Sequoias, had 19 
points.

DAS NEVES' EDGE IS NO HELP ON THE HILL

Helix's Daniel Das Neves appears to have a built-in advantage over his 
cross-country competitors. He is a Brazilian exchange student whose American 
host happens to be Luis de Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
De Oliveira, also a native of Brazil, is considered the top middle-distance 
coach in the United States. He has trained Mary Slaney and currently works with 
Joaquim Cruz and Ocky Clark. 
</P>
<P>
At the Section cross-country championships Saturday, Das Neves maintained a 
step advantage over San Pasqual's Robert Walker during the Division II race as 
the two approached the Upas Street hill, upon which most Morley Field 
cross-country races are won. 
</P>
<P>
So guess who kicked and left the other nine seconds behind at the finish line? 
The guy without a professional coach. 
</P>
<P>
Walker raced past Das Neves on the hill, opened a 25-yard lead and maintained 
it for the final half-mile to finish the three-mile course in 15 minutes 27 
seconds, the fastest time of the day. Das Neves came in at 15:36. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty scared," Walker said afterward. "Because I had never raced (Das 
Neves) before and I didn't know what he can do. Nobody does." 
</P>
<P>
That's more accurate than Walker might have thought because Das Neves still 
isn't sure what he's capable of. In fact, he said, the best runner might not 
have won Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am (a better runner)," Das Neves said. "The only thing is, I'm not 
in shape yet. I was just running with one pace. I only have one speed, and 
today I couldn't shift gears." 
</P>
<P>
Das Neves is bothered by a sore left Achilles' tendon, but said the injury is 
improving. Das Neves expects to do some speed workouts this week, which will 
help his kick at the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm feeling real good," he said, "so I'll probably do better next week." 
</P>
<P>
The best time for girls also came in Division II. Fallbrook sophomore Milena 
Glusac finished the 2.5-mile course in 14:30, 42 seconds faster than what she 
turned in last year when she won as a freshman.

The Coronado water polo team wasn't quite sure if its coach, Randy Burgess, 
would make it in time to see the Islanders play Poway for the 3-A Section title 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado (28-4) claimed its fourth consecutive Section title by defeating 
Poway, 14-9, at the Jewish Community Center. And Burgess, who did arrive 30 
minutes before the game, praised his team's play even though the Islanders had 
to play catchup a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"They played us tough, but I felt our kids weren't really focused on the game," 
Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 3-3 first-quarter tie, Poway forced Coronado to play catchup in the 
second quarter. At halftime, the score was again tied, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Poway (23-1) took an 8-6 lead. But with three minutes 
remaining in the quarter, Coronado went on a scoring spree and led, 10-8, 
entering the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was 8-6 I thought we were in control of the game," Poway Coach Greg 
Ormsby said. "They just went on a rampage. They're a very balanced field and 
(they have) the best qoalie in the county (Jack Bowen)." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Valhalla defeated USDHS, 17-10, to win the 2-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A game, USDHS tried, but couldn't stop Mike Nalu, who scored nine 
goals for Valhalla. Eric Nielsen added four for the Norsemen. USDHS was led by 
Doug Munz, who scored six goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to try to have two people on Mike when he gets the ball," USDHS 
Coach Dan Crane said. "He's so quick that he turns and make things happen."

UC SAN DIEGO COMES BACK TO CAPTURE VOLLEYBALL TITLE

About one month ago, Washington University took over the top spot in the NCAA's 
Division III volleyball poll by defeating the UC San Diego to win the 
championship of the Washington University National Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, UC San Diego got its revenge. Playing in front of an Division 
III-record crowd of 3,417 at Washington University's Field House, the Tritons 
rallied from a one-game deficit to defeat the defending champion Bears 15-4, 
13-15, 9-15, 15-8, 15-6 to win the Division III national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The national title was the Tritons' sixth in the 10 years there has been a 
Division III playoff. But if the Tritons (37-8) hadn't been to Washington 
University (31-3) earlier in the year, there wouldn't have been a championship 
this season, UC San Diego Coach Doug Dannevik said.. 
</P>
<P>
"That made about 100 percent of the difference," said Dannevik, whose team beat 
St. Benedict in Friday's semifinal. "If we hadn't seen St. Benedict and Wash. 
U. earlier in the year, there's no way we would have won. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an entirely different team that Wash. U. is. We don't have the height to 
battle with them. Our strategy tonight was to use the whole court, and serve 
short from the first part of the game to counter their height." 
</P>
<P>
It looked early like the Tritons' strategy would pay off. After the Bears 
jumped to a 4-1 lead in the first game, UC San Diego responded with 14 
consecutive points -- most coming on front-line blocks by All-Americans 
Elizabeth Tan and Vikki Van Duyne -- to win 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego won the first four points of the second game as well before 
Washington University started to roll behind senior All-American outside hitter 
Kathy Bersett, the Division III's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of several kills by Bersett, Wash. U. climbed back into it but 
still trailed the 11-8 when the Bears' Dianne Stites went out briefly with a 
turned ankle. Her replacement, Christine Masel, responded with two kills to 
make it 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears won the last four points of the game for a 15-13 victory, then rolled 
to an 11-4 lead on the strong serving of freshman Leslie Catlin in the third 
game en route to a 15-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons didn't fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
"We just needed to go back to our fundamentals, and follow the game plan," said 
Tan, the team captain. "We went over it a million times before this match, and 
we knew by the way we had played in the first game that we could do it again." 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the second and first game, our mind set changed," said sophomore 
outside hitter Elizabeth Vesanovic, who made the all-tournament team along with 
Tan and Van Duyne. "In our minds, I think we said: 'We got it.' And that kind 
of thinking can get you in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Dannevik decided a change in strategy was necessary. "Kathy Bersett is a great 
player," he said. "We had to make adjustments in the block to take her away. We 
tried to serve so she couldn't get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of some substitutions, the Tritons surged to a 15-8 victory to 
take the match to the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
Then they poured it on. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give them credit," Stites said. "They played a lot better than the 
last time they were here. They were getting to everything."

CLARK SAYS NO THANKS TO PADRES' LATEST OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
First baseman Jack Clark rejected the Padres' latest contract offer Saturday, 
and unless there's a radical change in negotiations, it appears highly unlikely 
that Clark will return to the Padres for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, after being informed that Clark will be one of 16 players eligible 
for second-look free agency because of the Collusion III ruling, offered Clark 
a one-year guaranteed contract for $2.5 million if he agrees to waive his right 
to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, said he is awaiting a response from Clark 
and agent Tom Reich. But when reached Saturday night at his home in Danville, 
Calif., Clark said the offer won't even be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got no chance at all on that one," Clark said. "Why would I sign that? 
I wouldn't give up my right to free agency to sign a one-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Padres could still enhance their proposal, McIlvaine insisted 
Saturday that they will not offer Clark a multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
And Clark said that unless the Padres offer him at least a two-year contract, 
or considerably raise their one-year offer, he'll likely play elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not expecting every team to knock my door down," said Clark, who earned $2 
million in 1990, "but I'm sure I'll get my share of offers." 
</P>
<P>
This is the Padres' second offer to Clark since August. Previously, they 
offered him $2.5 million, but according to Clark, the contract was not fully 
guaranteed. The original offer, Clark said, was for $2.1 million in base salary 
and $400,000 in incentives for games played. 
</P>
<P>
"That one wasn't even an offer," said Clark, who batted .266, with 25 homers 
and 62 runs batted in last season. "At least this one showed me something. To 
me, this is really their first offer." 
</P>
<P>
When McIlvaine was asked why he wouldn't offer Clark, 35, a multi-year 
contract, he said: "After what happened with the team last year, I don't want 
to take that risk. I don't know whether he was part of the problem or not, but 
I'll survey the situation this year." 
</P>
<P>
If Clark does not return to the Padres, McIlvaine said Jerald Clark likely will 
inherit the first-base job. Clark, 27, batted .267 with five homers in 101 
at-bats, and went five for 12 with three homers and seven RBIs in the final 
three games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McIlvaine, who spent this week evaluating the Padres in their 
organizational meetings, said the club probably will not dip into the 
high-priced free-agent market. Instead, they will attempt to strengthen the 
team through trades and the development of their minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, in order of need, McIlvaine said, will attempt to acquire a 
right-handed bullpen stopper to complement lefty Craig Lefferts; find a fifth 
starter; rectify the left side of the infield, and come up with a center 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right-handed reliever: "There's really not a whole lot out there on the 
free agent market," McIlvaine said, "and I'm not going to pay a guy like Buddy 
Black $10 million for four years. We'll probably have to trade a lefty (a group 
which includes Derek Lilliquist, Atlee Hammaker and Rich Rodriguez) to get a 
veteran righty." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fifth starter: If the Padres do not acquire a fifth starter, the job will 
go to either Lilliquist, Hammaker, Schiraldi or possibly free agent Dennis 
Rasmussen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop and third base: McIlvaine has abandoned plans to move second 
baseman Roberto Alomar to shortstop. He is expected to trade for a shortstop, 
with candidates including the Mets' Kevin Elster and the Giants' Jose Uribe. 
Roberts likely could be the starter at third, but McIlvaine said Eddie Williams 
will be given another shot, and the Padres will continue to look outside for a 
possible trade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center field: The Padres have decided that Joe Carter will be moved 
permanently to left field, and Tony Gwynn will stay in right. McIlvaine said 
the Padres will choose a starting center fielder from among Shawn Abner, Darrin 
Jackson and Thomas Howard.

SOCKERS AVERT THIRD-QUARTER COLLAPSE, BUT STILL LOSE IN OVERTIME

<P>
The Sockers could break only one string Saturday night, but the big one, a home 
losing streak which now has reached four games, continued. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Wichita Wings clipped the Sockers, 6-5, in overtime. It was the 
third time this year the Sockers have lost in overtime at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Rowe got the game-winner about two minutes into the extra session when he 
pounced on a rebound five feet in front of the goal and put it high into the 
net. Wichita was on a power play at the time. Forty-four seconds before the 
game ended, Ben Collins was asked to sit two minutes for tripping. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was especially difficult for the Sockers, because for the first time 
this year, they did not self-destruct in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game, the Sockers had allowed nine third-quarter goals in three 
home games while scoring only two. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Sockers (3-7) didn't score any goals in the quarter, but they 
limited Wichita to one. 
</P>
<P>
That came with six minutes remaining in the quarter, when Dale Ervine got past 
a Collins slide tackle and went one-on-one with Sockers goalie Victor Nogueira. 
Ervine beat Nogueira to the right side to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked as if the Sockers would pull out a victory. They came 
out strong in the fourth quarter, overcoming a one-goal deficit and taking a 
one-goal lead with about four minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' lead came as a result of Wichita's Victor Moreland using his face 
to block a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Moreland had to sacrifice his head when Waad Hirmez sent in a shot on goal with 
his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Moreland was standing 10 feet in front of the line when Hirmez's shot banked 
off his face. The shot was so hard that the carom carried all the way to 
midfield where defender Alex Golovnia put in another shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was a soft shot and had no chance of getting by Kris Peat, Wichita's second 
goalie of the evening, until, that is, Michael Collins got a foot on it five 
feet in front of the nets and redirected it high into the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Sockers a 5-4 lead, but Wichita sent it into overtime when Brad 
Smith scored a sixth-attacker goal with 1 1/2 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jimmy McGeough scored the game's first goal one minute nine seconds into 
the game as he volleyed a crossing pass from Perry Van Der Beck past Nogueira 
from 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of two goals for McGeough in the first half. He also scored 
with about two minutes remaining in the second quarter when he tapped in a 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
But between McGeough's two goals, the Sockers scored three, one each from Paul 
Dougherty, Alex Golovnia and Hirmez. 
</P>
<P>
For Golovnia, a former Soviet national team player who is playing indoor soccer 
for the first time, it was his first goal in the Major Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez's goal moved him ahead of Kaz Deyna and Steve Zungul into fourth on the 
Sockers' all-time scorers list with 119 goals. The goal also extended Hirmez's 
point streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, most of which attended the game with discount tickets on American 
Youth Soccer Assn. night, was the largest of the year. . . . Wichita goalie Ron 
Fearon left the game in the second quarter when he sustained a sprained neck 
after a collision with a Socker player.

AZTEC NOTEBOOK;

POSSIBLE BID BOWLS OVER SDSU

<P>
And suddenly, there was bowl talk. 
</P>
<P>
It's still a longshot, but San Diego State Athletic Director Fred Miller said 
Saturday that the Aztecs are among a handful of teams under consideration for 
an Independence Bowl berth. Miller and SDSU Coach Al Luginbill talked to the 
players about it after Saturday's 40-34 victory at New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's there, we're more than happy to take it," quarterback Dan McGwire 
said. "We have an explosive offense and our defense is coming around. I think 
this team deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
Said receiver Dennis Arey: "(Luginbill) mentioned something about it. He says 
we're getting looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Arey brushed aside bowl talk, though, in favor of Saturday's game against Texas 
El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't get looked at if we don't win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After UTEP, the Aztecs finish the season against Miami, Fla., at home Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Independence Bowl is Dec. 15 in Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's top three receivers -- Arey, Patrick Rowe and Jimmy Raye -- all had big 
games against New Mexico despite what most Aztecs thought was an all-around 
inconsistent day. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who had 131 yards receiving, broke the 100-yard barrier for the seventh 
consecutive game, leaving him one short of tying the NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
He credits some of his success to Arey and Raye. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to defense three great receivers," Rowe said. "If a receiver from 
another team is great, with two average receivers, he might be average. With me 
and Dennis and Jimmy, it's like three great receivers.

Arey had 150 yards and Raye 110 and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The general consensus was that the offense was inconsistent because New Mexico 
changed its defense for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't blitz," Luginbill said. "They came a few times, but not like 
earlier in the year. They changed their thought process to make us earn it and 
not give us any big plays."

Aztec Notes

Sophomore free safety Damon Pieri left the game in the fourth quarter with a 
bruised hand. SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said he planned to have it X-rayed when 
he returned to San Diego. . . . Marlon Andrews had two interceptions Saturday. 
SDSU has now had five in its last three games after not getting any in its 
first six games. . . . SDSU has scored 30 or more points in each of its past 
eight games, and the Aztecs have scored 40 or more three times in a row and in 
five of their past six games. . . . Luginbill on SDSU's unbalanced offense: 
"It's insane to have (530) passing yards and (158) rushing. It doesn't make any 
sense. But right now, we're playing in spurts. I want to get us to where, 
toward the end of the year, we're at the same level of intensity for a whole 
game." He better hurry -- there are only two games left. . . . For the second 
time this year, SDSU lost the turnover battle. SDSU had three, New Mexico had 
two.

PERSONAL FINANCE: BEWARE DEBT, THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Christmas shopping season officially begins this week. For many consumers, 
that means trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Already overextended with credit card borrowing and other debt, too many 
consumers spend way beyond their means during the holidays. When January rolls 
around, they're left with a hangover of unpaid bills and unhappy creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas spending sprees "will often be the final straw that hits people" 
already in the debt doghouse, says Gary Stroth, executive director of the 
Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Los Angeles, a nonprofit agency that 
helps people with debt problems. The agency's busiest season for overextended 
consumers is January, February and March, "once all the Christmas bills 
arrive," Stroth says. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding a debt disaster is especially important now, as the economy flirts 
with a recession that could threaten your job, pay raise or investments. Here 
are some common-sense tips on avoiding post-holiday financial blues: 
</P>
<P>
* Make a budget and stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
Figure out how much you can reasonably afford to spend. One way is by listing 
your income from wages and investments, and then subtracting your regular 
minimum monthly expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, food, auto loan 
payments, insurance and utility bills. What's left is discretionary income that 
you could use for Christmas spending. 
</P>
<P>
Once you figure out how much you can afford, make a list of those you will give 
to and the amounts per person. Take the list with you when you go shopping. If 
you spend less on one person, you can spend more on another. 
</P>
<P>
Shop for bargains but resist the temptation to spend more than your total, so 
that you don't go broke "saving" money. 
</P>
<P>
"And don't go shopping at the last minute; that causes impulse buying," Stroth 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
* Recognize the warning signs of too much debt. 
</P>
<P>
You have no business increasing your borrowing at all if you fit any of the 
following conditions: your payments are always late and you are constantly 
receiving collection notices from creditors; you are constantly taking cash 
advances on your credit card; you are opening up more credit cards just to pay 
off debts on other cards; you are using savings to pay basic monthly bills such 
as rent or utilities; your savings total less than three months of after-tax 
earnings, or you use more than 20% of your take-home pay to pay monthly 
non-mortgage installment debts such as car payments and credit card bills. 
</P>
<P>
If you meet any of these conditions, it's time to cut back on your debts -- not 
add to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Reduce your credit card costs. 
</P>
<P>
If you tend to carry an account balance, use bank-issued credit cards such as 
Visa or MasterCard instead of retailer-issued cards. The average interest rate 
on bank cards is about 18.7%, compared to 20% and higher for many retailer 
cards, says Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer 
credit protection group. And by shopping around, you can find bank cards with 
rates that are lower than average. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you pay off your accounts in full, use a retail card, 
Holstein says. They generally don't charge annual fees. 
</P>
<P>
* Understand the costs of credit card promotions and gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
Many issuers, for example, offer "skip payment" options where you don't have to 
pay every other month. Sounds great. But finance charges will generally 
continue to accrue during the months you don't pay, Holstein says. The same is 
often true of deferred-payment offers where you don't have to pay for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider alternatives to borrowing and spending. 
</P>
<P>
Use cash. At least you can only spend what you have. Or go on a Christmas 
savings program. Figure out what you spend on Christmas and make it a point to 
save a twelfth of that amount each month during the year, Stroth suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the best gifts are not necessarily the most expensive -- or ones that you 
buy. Christmas presents that you make, like baked goods, show thoughtfulness 
and "can be just as appreciated as any you purchase," Stroth says. 
</P>
<P>
* Beware of credit scams. 
</P>
<P>
Holidays are heydays for credit scam artists, Holstein says. His suggestions: 
Offer your credit card for identification but refuse to allow merchants to 
write your card numbers down on checks; destroy carbons; check billing 
statements carefully for purchases you did not make or that were never 
delivered and write your card issuer immediately to dispute such charges; never 
give your card number over the phone unless you are certain that the company is 
reputable, and keep your card in view when you give it to sales clerks to 
prevent them from making extra imprints. 
</P>
<P>
* Know what to do if you get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Contact your creditors. They can often help you work out a more manageable 
repayment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, seek a reputable credit counselor. One of the best services 
nationwide is run by the nonprofit National Foundation for Consumer Credit. 
That is the umbrella organization for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of 
Los Angeles and similar groups throughout the nation. Among other things, they 
can help you set up a budget and work out a repayment plan with your creditors.

INSPECTOR NO. 6 KEEPS 'EM ON THEIR TOES;

THE SEAMSTRESSES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE MEETING SPECIFICATIONS.

"I will keep the tag as a charm 
</P>
<P>
 against all future irregulars 
</P>
<P>
 which may have been inspected 
</P>
<P>
 and sent away 
</P>
<P>
 without love . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Stone, 'Poem in Praise of Perfect Pants' 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 1,800 times on this typical day, Debbie Slade will check the seams, the 
snaps, the fabric and the measurements of baby pajamas before sticking on her 
signature: "Inspected by No. 6." 
</P>
<P>
But then, life is full of inspections. 
</P>
<P>
She's got exams to think about in her night classes. She's got to keep the 
pounds off, working out on the exercise bike her husband bought her. And in a 
year or two, she hopes to have the first granddaughter in her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pushing us to have that granddaughter. It's all boys," Inspector 
No. 6 says amid the clatter of sewing, cutting and fastening machines in the 
Gerber Childrenswear plant. A box of three dozen completed outfits has just 
been added to the never-finished pile next to her 4-by-6-foot work table. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they're hot-pink affairs, tiny "fashion sleepers." She'll get to 
that box next, visualizing the wearer. "You can just picture the little girl, 
with the little bows and everything," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector No. 6 laughs, but she doesn't pause. Hands tugging seams and probing 
terry-cloth toes, she works at what seems a double-time pace, like nearly 
everyone at the plant, where pay is usually by the piece. 
</P>
<P>
The infant clothes are created by dozens of seamstresses arrayed in rows in a 
room the size of a football field. Some wear stereo earphones to drown the 
sewing machines' whir and the snare-drum-like cracks as "gripper girls" pound 
metal snaps into place. Some talk over the noise. 
</P>
<P>
"Peggy, you feeling good today?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling all right." 
</P>
<P>
Some spend all day making nothing but collars, others nothing but sleeves or 
cuffs, to be passed along to the next seamstress, who with a quick arc of 
stitches attaches that part to the evolving garment. 
</P>
<P>
By the time all the pattern pieces finally come together as pajamas, they've 
reached 28-year-old Debbie Slade and the other "100% inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
Inside-out and unsnapped, the outfits quickly are reversed, snapped, checked 
and sent by the inspectors on their way, in one of three directions. 
</P>
<P>
Most go toward the packagers, to be placed in boxes marked "Crafted With Pride 
in the U.S.A." Others go back to sewing machines to have minor irregularities 
mended. Some, with faded fabric or a leg that's too wide, go to the seconds 
box. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, the outfits that pass inspection go to Frances Martin, the 
plant's quality assurance manager. Years ago, she was Inspector No. 10 at 
another plant. 
</P>
<P>
All day, she roves among the seamstresses, checking, occasionally turning a 
garment back to be resewn. "But Frances," Sandra Brake jokingly protests from 
behind her machine, "I crafted it with pride." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, there is some friction when a garment is rejected, acknowledges 
quality control executive David Sanders. That's because the piecework 
seamstress loses production time. "You can't make money doing repairs," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also inspects the inspectors, sending reports on to Sanders. She pulls a 
set percentage of outfits from the dozens they examine and gets out her ruler 
"to make sure they're meeting specifications." 
</P>
<P>
Sleeve: 10 1/4 inches long. Neck: 5 inches across. Another inspection for 
Inspector No. 6. On this day, her sheet in Martin's log shows a perfect score. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people, when they ask me, 'What do you do?' and I say, 'I'm an 
inspector,' they say, 'Do you inspect Hanes?' -- you know, the underwear 
inspector," No. 6 says, laughing again, recalling the television commercial of 
a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In it, a no-nonsense Inspector No. 12 tugs the elastic of briefs before 
growling into the camera: "They don't say Hanes until I say they say Hanes." 
</P>
<P>
Inspector No. 6 feels similarly proprietary. 
</P>
<P>
With sharp nippers that have left scars on her fingertips in five years at this 
job, she cuts extraneous threads while telling a story. 
</P>
<P>
A new mother wrote a letter complaining about an uncut string, an 
inconsequential matter until it gets wrapped around a baby's toe. The infant 
wasn't hurt, but Slade says the message registered. "It was a dangerous thing," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Plant managers pass such problems back to those assigned to catch them. Whose 
inspector label turned up isn't mentioned. "They just talk to all of us about 
it," No. 6 says, and she's not smiling now. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me if it's mine," she says. "I know I put labels in mine because I want 
to know."

FIRMS SEEK CUTS IN COSTS ARISING FROM BIRTHS;

BENEFITS: TO HELP WOMEN EMPLOYEES BEAR HEALTHY BABIES, EMPLOYERS ARE SPONSORING 
PRENATAL CLASSES AND ENCOURAGING EARLY DOCTOR VISITS.

Haggar Apparel Co. is using some new weapons in its fight against rising 
pregnancy-related medical costs, including work-place prenatal education, a 
change in the company insurance plan and free infant car seats. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, officials of the Dallas-based men's clothing manufacturer have 
sought to offset costs associated with premature births or births of unhealthy 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
Such expenses can be staggering. One Fortune 100 company in the New York area 
found in 1988 that the average hospital charge alone for a sick newborn of an 
employee was $21,000, compared to $700 for a healthy baby, according to the 
Conference Board, a New York-based business research organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Childbirth-related expenses are one of the largest single components in 
health-care costs," said Irene McKirgan, director of health promotion programs 
for the March of Dimes. "All you need is one unhealthy birth, and it can have a 
devastating effect on the company's bottom line. It's not uncommon for a 
company to have a million-dollar baby." 
</P>
<P>
One key to combating the problem is making sure that expectant mothers seek 
early medical care and are informed about such basic health precautions as 
refraining from drinking alcohol or smoking while pregnant. Haggar, which has a 
large female work force, opted not only to educate employees about the do's and 
don't's of pregnancy, but also to find ways to encourage women -- some of whom 
wait until the seventh month of pregnancy to make a first visit to a doctor -- 
to seek first-trimester medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Haggar introduced "Babies and You," prenatal-care classes 
that the March of Dimes offers at corporate work sites. As an incentive to 
attend classes, Haggar offered expectant mothers free baby car seats. 
</P>
<P>
The classes, in English and Spanish -- to accommodate a large Spanish-speaking 
segment of the work force -- came on the heels of another innovation. Last 
year, the company changed its insurance plan so mothers wouldn't have to wait 
until they delivered to be reimbursed for pregnancy-related medical expenses. 
Now, it makes up-front payments to the doctor for any woman who seeks medical 
care in the first three months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The result? A 22% decline in premature or unhealthy babies born to employees in 
the past year, said Mark Robinson, manager of Haggar's wellness program. 
</P>
<P>
Haggar joins a handful of companies that are also looking at financial 
incentives to get appropriate medical care for expectant mothers, according to 
McKirgan of the March of Dimes. Among them are First National Bank of Chicago. 
It waives the $225 deductible on health insurance expenses in the first year of 
a newborn's life if the baby's mother has gone through the "Babies and You" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
All told, about 270 corporations participate in the March of Dimes 
prenatal-classes program.

IT'S NO LONGER 'MUM'S THE WORD' ON CUTBACKS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC RELATIONS: TROUBLED COMPANIES ARE HIRING SPECIALISTS TO HEAD OFF FALSE 
RUMORS ABOUT THEIR FISCAL HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WARREN BROWN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<P>
Companies in trouble are dumping the notion that no news is good news, and that 
couldn't be better news for public relations firms and business consultants. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles to the District of Columbia, PR firms are honing a new 
specialty -- teaching clients hit hard by the economic downturn how best to 
disseminate information to their employees, suppliers, bankers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
A number of these self-described "crisis management" companies are new, such as 
Sitrick &amp; Co., formed nearly three years ago by people who had worked with 
corporate turnaround artist Sanford Sigoloff. Others are PR firms such as Kekst 
Inc. that once specialized in mergers and acquisitions but have since moved to 
what they consider a better opportunity for growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is increasing," said Jay M. Jaffe, president of the Washington-based 
PR firm Jaffe Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, local real estate firms were calling me to help them market 
their properties. Today, they are calling me to help them with bankruptcy 
filings. I'm getting at least one Chapter 11 call a week," said Jaffe, 
referring to the title under which many businesses seek to reorganize their 
affairs in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
Operating in teams of three to five people, trouble-shooting PR firms often 
arrive at the doorsteps of a beleaguered client on the eve of an appearance in 
bankruptcy court or as they are considering the possibility of seeking 
protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies offering crisis management advice say that they would prefer to 
become involved with a troubled company as early as possible, say four to six 
months before the firm winds up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the ideal," said Stephen H. Case, a bankruptcy lawyer in the Washington 
office of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell who reports that he has increasingly seen 
his clients turn to PR firms in times of trouble. "The fact of life is that 
these things usually are handled at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
Another fact is that five years ago most troubled companies, especially those 
faced with a bankruptcy court date, would not have bothered to call a public 
relations firm at all, Case said. 
</P>
<P>
But the increasing complexity of business reorganizations, reflecting the 
complexity of the companies involved in them, has changed the "mum's-the-word" 
approach to corporate fiscal crises. Instead, they are seeking what Jaffe likes 
to call "rumor control." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors often start when companies choose to squelch information, causing their 
employees, stockholders, suppliers and bankers to dig for their own answers to 
tough questions, said attorney Alan S. Gover, a bankruptcy lawyer in the 
Houston office of Weil, Gotschal and Manges. 
</P>
<P>
Erroneous information can cause employees to panic and abandon ship, and it can 
cause suppliers to stop shipping, customers to stop shopping and creditors to 
start suing -- all of which can hurt a company's chances for survival, Gover 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While their intentions may be good, the effectiveness and quality of these 
crisis management experts are difficult to measure, according to bankruptcy 
attorneys and others who have used their services. 
</P>
<P>
Some financially ailing companies say privately that their public relations 
consultants actually hurt them by giving the "wrong" advice -- telling them to 
forewarn employees of layoffs before the plans are firm, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for mistakes in business reorganizations," said Michael 
Sitrick, who is chairman and chief executive of the 17-member public relations 
firm specializing in such work. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not just talking about a financial workout. You're talking about 
people's lives. The wrong word at the wrong time can ruin everything and put a 
company under. It's a hell of a responsibility. Rather than fool around with a 
public relations firm that isn't going to handle it right, a company would be 
better off leaving everything up to the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Sitrick and Co., apparently fearing nothing from competitors, is publishing its 
crisis management techniques in an upcoming book. Among other things, the 
company advises troubled companies to: 
</P>
<P>
* Create a crisis management team to address communications issues. 
</P>
<P>
* Make the lawyers part of that team. 
</P>
<P>
* Restrict who can speak to the media. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure there are people specially trained to handle the calls of 
shareholders, bondholders and vendors. 
</P>
<P>
* Decide what you want the story to be; stress, for example, "the difference 
between laying off 3,000 people in a 31,000-employee company and " 'saving' 
28,000 jobs by restructuring," Sitrick said.

BAD SNAP GREASES CSUN SKID; 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION II PLAYOFFS: BOTCHED PUNT SENDS MATADORS TO THIRD CONSECUTIVE CLOSE 
LOSS, 14-7.

SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were the Fann factor and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's defense to consider. 
Or would Cal State Northridge turn to the pass? 
</P>
<P>
A number of elements can decide a game between football teams as evenly matched 
as Northridge and San Luis Obispo, co-champions of the Western Football 
Conference who met for the second time in 15 days Saturday in the first round 
of the NCAA Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the obvious ones applied as San Luis Obispo won, 14-7, in front of 
3,703 at Mustang Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it came down to an exchange that had been completed without a hitch 79 
previous times during the season. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied and 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining, CSUN punter Albert Razo 
stood near the Matadors' 12-yard-line and prepared to accept the hike from 
Homan Farahmand. 
</P>
<P>
The ball arrived way off target, skidding into the grass a yard in front of 
Razo's feet. Razo covered it at the 12, but San Luis Obispo took possession. 
Four plays later, tailback Joe Fragiadakis dived over right guard for the 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap came bad to me and I tried to do what I could do with it. . . . which 
was nothing," Razo said. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's offense could relate. The Matadors, even with a healthy Albert 
Fann carrying 31 times for 80 yards from the tailback position, gained only 132 
yards against the top-rated defense in Division II. San Luis Obispo could do 
little better, gaining 188 yards, but the Mustangs (10-1) did manage to advance 
to the quarterfinals against top-ranked North Dakota State (11-0) on Saturday 
in Fargo, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to who was going to make a mistake first and we made the one that 
got us beat," Matador Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (7-4) finished the season with three consecutive losses -- by a 
total of 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
In its first game against the Mustangs, to decide the WFC title, CSUN lost, 
6-3, when an interception at the Matador 12 set up San Luis Obispo's only 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Last week against Division I Cal State Long Beach, Northridge lost, 25-24, when 
a pass that was batted into the air landed in the arms of a 49er receiver for a 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the trifecta of unusual defeats was climaxed by the snap that 
didn't click. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a great job all year long. It just so happened that this one hit the 
ground," Burt said of Farahmand. "It should never have come down to that, 
anyway. . . . That touchdown means nothing if we score two other touchdowns 
early like we should have." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Northridge had its chances, courtesy of its secondary. Cornerback Eric 
Barnes had two interceptions and safety Eric Treibatch had another. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' second of the game set up Northridge's touchdown, a seven-yard pass 
from quarterback Sherdrick Bonner to Adam McKinney with 11:26 remaining that 
tied the score, 7-7. The Matadors' other interceptions -- both in Mustang 
territory -- were in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we would get a good play, they would come back with another play, 
which is what a good football team will do," said Fann, who closed the season 
with 998 rushing yards and his career with 7,156 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
Treibatch's second-quarter interception gave CSUN the ball at the San Luis 
Obispo 29, but the Matadors stalled there and Abo Velasco shanked a 47-yard 
field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It was the best scoring opportunity for either team in a scoreless first half. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge threatened again in the third quarter when Barnes picked off a David 
Lafferty pass at the Mustang 48 and returned the ball to the 37. 
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive runs by Fann brought Northridge to the 20, where, on second 
and seven, Bonner found wide receiver Billy Nealy open at the five-yard line. 
Nealy dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
After another incomplete pass, Velasco came on for a 37-yard field-goal attempt 
that he hit wide right. Velasco, a senior from Burbank, finished as the 
school's career leader in field goals (34). However, he missed 11 of his last 
14 tries. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hurt our own selves, just shot ourselves in the foot with penalties 
and other things happening to us," Bonner said. "We just couldn't sustain 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was penalized only five times for 30 yards -- but three infractions 
came when the Matadors were inside the San Luis Obispo 40. 
</P>
<P>
Fragiadakis scored on a nine-yard run with 4:16 left in the third quarter, 
carrying CSUN cornerback Baron Atkinson on his shoulders for the final five 
yards to give the Mustangs a 7-0 lead.

PLAYOFFS COME AND GO QUICKLY FOR MOST VENTURA COUNTY FOOTBALL TEAMS

<P>
Mistakes are costly at any time during a football game, but they can bankrupt a 
team come playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of nine Ventura County teams were testament to that Friday in the 
Southern Section playoffs. Only Camarillo (Division II) and Oak Park (Division 
XI) avoided those often-deadly miscues and advanced to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Thousand Oaks, which has the county's richest tradition of playing 
mistake-free football, fumbled six times and lost four during a 31-27 loss to 
Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Richards was still shaking his head Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a team do that," he said. "It's an absolute mystery to me." 
</P>
<P>
Marmonte League foes Westlake and Royal also were eliminated because, in no 
small part, of mistakes. Five Warrior interceptions and a fumble were turned 
into four Muir scores during a 52-13 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult enough to stop a team like Muir without giving them six more 
opportunities," Coach Jim Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal twice drove inside Downey's 10-yard line without scoring a touchdown and 
lost, 17-10. On one drive, an illegal-procedure penalty forced the Highlanders 
to settle for a field goal. On another, a holding call erased a touchdown and 
the drive ended on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, the Channel League champion, was not immune to blunders in a 59-30 
loss to Capistrano Valley. Ventura's first three drives resulted in two 
turnovers and a blocked punt, and, consequently, a 17-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And Rio Mesa quarterback Angel Lopez, who had thrown only three interceptions 
entering the game, tossed four in a 27-7 loss to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"The playoffs are a very strange time," Ventura Coach Harvey Kochel said. 
</P>
<P>
Parting shots: Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle, who is retiring at the end 
of this his 28th season at the school and 34th overall, criticized Reseda's 
program in The Daily Breeze, citing Reseda's longtime reluctance to move from 
the City Section 3-A Division to the 4-A level. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda enjoyed 11 years of success at the 3-A level until this season, when the 
Regents were elevated to 4-A. Reseda, which finished 5-4, even had an 
opportunity to win the North Valley League title until it lost to Kennedy on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Reseda cried and cried that they can't compete in the 4-A, they 
can't do this, and they can't do that," Vollnogle was quoted as saying in the 
newspaper's Thursday edition. "Well, they could end up winning their league 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It aggravates me that people don't try to upgrade their program to a higher 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer responded Saturday with accusations that Vollnogle 
has built a successful program at Carson because of illegal recruiting. 
Schaeffer cited the transfer of quarterback John Walsh from West Torrance to 
Carson before this season. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation this fall by the City Section office exonerated Carson but did 
not convince Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Walsh's transfer was highway robbery," Schaeffer said. "At least I don't have 
any skeletons in the closet like (Vollnogle) does. I respect him for being in 
the game as long as he has, but he has no right to throw daggers at anybody. 
Recruiting is a big part of his program, but it isn't any part of mine." 
</P>
<P>
A ticking bomb: Cleveland Coach Steve Landress watched too many Cavaliers 
hobble toward the sidelines Friday. His frustration peaked when he was ejected 
with 30 seconds remaining in a a 27-0 loss to San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Landress said he was upset because officials were slow in whistling a play 
dead. Landress said Cleveland running back Derrick Dumas was stopped by three 
San Fernando players and a fourth player was allowed to take a final blow 
before a whistle was blown. 
</P>
<P>
A few plays earlier, sophomore tailback Ibn Bilal (knee) had become Cleveland's 
fifth player to be forced from the game because of an injury. Quarterback David 
Erhardt (cracked rib), Palen Sorensen (ankle), Michael Wamsganz (knee) and 
Keyan Murphy (ankle) were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt the official should have blown his whistle in that situation," 
Landress said. "Why have the kid held up like a sponge when the game's clearly 
out of reach? They should be protecting the kids, and they weren't doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Landress was penalized twice for unsportsmanlike conduct, which resulted in his 
first ejection in 15 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, it was Landress' counterpart Friday, San Fernando Coach Tom 
Hernandez, who two weeks ago filed a complaint with the City Section office. 
</P>
<P>
"The officiating is extremely poor," Landress said. "It's the worst I've seen 
in my 15 years of coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Signings: Channel Islands center fielder Jacob Cruz, who hit .494 and was an 
All-Marmonte League selection, has signed an early letter of intent to attend 
Arizona State. Simi Valley's Tyler Nelson (Cal State Northridge) and 
Camarillo's Mike Muncy (Arizona State) also have signed letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Future signing: Rio Mesa's Dmitri Young, the state freshman, sophomore and 
junior baseball player of the year, is visiting the University of Miami this 
weekend. Young, a projected first-round pick in the amateur draft, is also 
planning visits to Auburn, Oklahoma State, Arizona State and Texas.

MIRA COSTA GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL TEAM IS DEFEATED BY CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>

<P>
The Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball championship plaque took a brief 
detour on the way to the Corona del Mar High trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
After Corona del Mar defeated Mira Costa, 15-12, 15-9, 15-8, Saturday night in 
the 5-A championship game at Cerritos College, the Sea King players presented 
the plaque to their former coach, Charlie Brande. 
</P>
<P>
Middle blocker Lara Carlsen had 18 kills and outside hitter Tracy Schriber 
added 13 as the top-seeded Sea Kings won their 22nd consecutive match. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a bright spot in a somewhat frustrating season for the Sea 
Kings. Brande resigned two weeks before the season began in the wake of an 
investigation by the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
The players practiced on their own for a week before interim Coach Dale 
Flickinger was hired. 
</P>
<P>
"We've dedicated the season to Charlie," Carlsen said. "He means a lot to all 
of us. This is the greatest feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Flickinger said Brande "was the guy who did all the work with this team. It's a 
shame he couldn't have been out here." 
</P>
<P>
Brande watched from the stands as Corona del Mar's avenged a three-game loss to 
Mira Costa in last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-A title was the first since 1978 for the Sea Kings. Corona del Mar (24-1) 
advances to the state Division I playoffs, which start this week. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy DeGarceau had 19 kills and Jennifer Smith 12 to lead Mira Costa (20-2). 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar trailed in the first game, 12-11, but three kills up the middle 
by Carlsen and a block by setter Prentice Perkins gave the Sea Kings the 
victory.

PRIDE CARRIES VALLEY BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH, 20-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Down to its last game and with no bowl to call its own, Valley College lined up 
against Santa Monica on Saturday and played for pride. 
</P>
<P>
And until Cuneyt Karacuha's 38-yard field-goal attempt sailed just wide left 
late in the fourth period, it looked like Valley might have something to be 
proud of. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, host Valley's 20-17 Western State Conference loss to bowl-bound 
Santa Monica was just another frustrating Saturday in a season filled with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of upsetting. That field goal missed by about an inch from tying the 
score," Valley quarterback Mark Mengoni said. "I was glad we could stay close 
to them, but we should have beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (3-7 overall, 3-6 in conference play) battled back from 7-0 and 14-7 
deficits to tie the score, 14-14, on Mengoni's 58-yard touchdown pass to Cliff 
Robinson and Karacuha's conversion kick late in the second period. The Monarchs 
took the lead on Karacuha's 36-yard third-quarter field goal and stopped Santa 
Monica on three consecutive possessions before Jeff Barrett engineered the 
game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett completed a 63-yard pass to Jason Lucky to put the ball at the Valley 
18, and four plays later Barrett scored on a nine-yard keeper. Chris Jackson's 
kick was wide, but Santa Monica (8-2, 7-2) led, 20-17, with 9 minutes 9 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Valley drove 31 yards in 11 plays to set up Karacuha's potential game-tying 
kick, but the ball sailed wide with 3:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, who completed eight of 28 for 228 yards and threw two interceptions, 
had a hand in all three Corsair touchdowns, scoring on a one-yard 
second-quarter sneak and tossing an 80-yard touchdown pass to Turhon O'Bannon 
on Santa Monica's first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Mengoni, who entered the game in the first period after starter Trendell 
Williams reaggravated a season-long rotator cuff injury, completed 10 of 20 for 
141 yards with one interception.

ARELLANO'S WIN PUTS BELMONT BACK ON TOP;

CHAMPIONSHIPS: UNLIKELY TRIUMPH SETS UP SENTINELS' EIGHTH TITLE IN NINE YEARS.

A surprising victory by Belmont High's Rene Arellano in the City Section 
cross-country championships at Pierce College on Saturday led to a 
not-too-surprising outcome in the race for the team title. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano won the three-mile race in 14 minutes 58 seconds and Belmont placed 
five runners among the top 12 to easily win its eighth championship in the past 
nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels totaled 32 points; defending champion Taft was second with 115, 
two points ahead of Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe (188) and Birmingham (196) were eighth and ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont won its second consecutive girls' title, placing four runners among the 
top eight to win with 19 points. San Pedro was a distant second with 108 and 
Narbonne was third with 134. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real tied with Garfield for fourth with 148 points but finished fifth 
on the basis of a slower sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (165), Birmingham (176), Chatsworth (258) and Grant (297) finished sixth, 
seventh, ninth and 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont, which also won the boys' sophomore and junior-varsity divisions, 
became the first school to win girls' and boys' City titles in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
The top two teams and the first five individuals not on the top two teams 
qualified for the state meet Nov. 24 at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
University's Robin Snowbeck powered past Kennedy's Jennie Armenta on the final 
downhill stretch of the race to win the girls' race in 18:40. Armenta was 
second in 18:47. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's Oshonda Posey led during the early stages before fading to 
third in 19:06. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real's Gina Zeno finished ninth, holding off Poly's Janet Bailon for 
the fifth individual qualifying berth. Both were timed in 20:06. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano ran in a pack that included pre-meet favorites Steve Gonzales 
(Carson), Brian Godsey (Taft) and Ben Mesfen (Venice) before breaking away with 
just under a mile remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself I was going to go out with them," said Arellano, who ran 15:33 
and finished 24 seconds behind Gonzales in the City preliminaries the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"They started slowing down and I was kind of afraid when I took the lead. It 
was a perfect race." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, third last year, finished second in 15:08. Godsey (15:29) edged 
Mesfen (15:30) for third. Monroe's Lorenzo Ortiz was ninth in 16:00. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," Belmont Coach Gordon Weisenberger said. "I thought we might 
have a shot at winning the team title, but there was no way that I thought 
(Arellano) would win the race. He just rose to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Taft did not. 
</P>
<P>
Godsey ran 14 seconds slower than in the preliminaries, and Taft's five scoring 
runners ran an average of 28 seconds slower than their best on the Pierce 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to hang back," said Godsey, who placed fifth last season. 
"(Gonzales) was making a lot of surges and that took out a lot out of 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Kipp Ortenburger (16:29) and Torino Carr (16:30) placed 20th and 21st. Chip 
English (17:16) and Caesar Rodriguez (17:23) finished 42nd and 46th to round 
out Taft's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," Taft Coach Mel Hein said. "We've done the 
training and we've done the sprints. We were prepared, but everybody was off. 
We were lucky to finish second."

O.C. JAIL PACKS 'EM IN, BUT EACH CASE IS UNIQUE 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One after another, 26 prisoners -- from nervous young thieves to surly, 
tattooed toughs -- stepped before Deputy Sheriff Joel Monroe on Friday night as 
he hurried to decide how best to keep them safe and alive. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever been arrested before? . . . Do you have any gang affiliations? . 
. . Have you ever attempted suicide? . . . Are you a homosexual?" 
</P>
<P>
From a few feet away, it's impossible for an observer to hear the answers that 
the inmates mumble through the thick glass, but those responses will weigh 
heavily on their time in jail. Based on that information and the way they 
behave, inmates will get a wristband -- white for minimum-security prisoners; 
yellow, orange, red or blue for the more hardened or at-risk ones. 
</P>
<P>
Lock up an 18-year-old thief next to a murderer, or leave members of rival 
gangs in the same cell, and it's not long before, as one sheriff's official put 
it: "We'll have blood and pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Because of an ever-booming number of arrests and overcrowding in the Orange 
County jail system -- a problem that has gone from bad to critical in recent 
years -- Monroe has to pick the right wristband dozens of times every night and 
juggle inmates throughout the system to keep it from choking. It's a 
high-stakes human shell game in which a mistake can put an inmate's life in 
serious danger. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, despite their quick and careful work, the efforts of Monroe and his 
colleagues can barely keep pace with the flow of humanity that builds nightly 
inside the 4,400-inmate county jail system -- a stark and frightening world 
unto itself rarely glimpsed by law-abiding people. 
</P>
<P>
As the hour slipped past midnight Friday into Saturday morning, dozens of male 
inmates who had arrived the previous afternoon were still slumped in their 
holding cells, squirming on the 18.5 inches of cement bench space allocated to 
each prisoner while he waits for a bed to open up. Beneath bright overhead 
lights, they lolled on the benches -- some in street clothes, others in jail 
overalls -- heads drooped wearily in open hands. Some slept while others paced, 
eyeing the deputies who eyed them back through thick glass. 
</P>
<P>
And that's on a slow night. 
</P>
<P>
A busy Friday evening shift, which runs from 3 to 11 p.m., typically brings 
more than 130 bookings through the Intake-Release Center, an 
antiseptic-smelling, surprisingly quiet entryway into the county jail system. 
When they come in that quickly, the backup often runs to more than 18 hours. 
</P>
<P>
During the night shift Friday, only 91 prisoners entered the facility -- from 
the frightened, uniformed postal worker dragged in on a drunk-driving arrest to 
the black-clad gang members who grin cockily throughout the process. And even 
though the incoming inmates sometimes backed up six or eight deep as they 
waited to be searched, jailers commented all evening long about how slow 
business was. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1978 federal court order, the Sheriff's Department is required to find 
a bed for every prisoner within 24 hours of arrival. That same order caps the 
number of inmates allowed on two floors of the Santa Ana Men's Jail, but does 
not limit the number who can be held at four other county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the other facilities are routinely overcrowded, exceeding their 
rated capacity by hundreds of inmates and making the struggle for bed space a 
constant feature of life inside the jail system. To address that problem, 
lawyers for county inmates last week filed a motion in U.S. District Court that 
would amend the 1978 order by extending the population caps to every county 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The exact effect of such a cap is disputed by American Civil Liberties Union 
lawyers, who represent the inmates, and Sheriff's Department officials. Both 
parties agree that it would dramatically reshape the county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
Already bursting at the seams, the population in the housing units would be 
even more restricted. That would test the deputies even further. But it also 
would mean far less crowded housing units and it would force the system to move 
inmates through more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, overcrowding can make that process an agonizingly slow one. 
</P>
<P>
Even on a "slow" evening such as Friday, the prisoners trickle into the county 
system constantly, some arriving from area police departments or California 
Highway Patrol units. Others are escorted in by sheriff's deputies on patrol. 
They come so fast that deputies simply refer to them as "bodies." 
</P>
<P>
As they arrive through the facility's heavy metal and glass double doors, a 
shadow falls across many of the prisoners' eyes. The door slams behind them, 
and many realize for the first time that they now are in jail. 
</P>
<P>
All are handcuffed, most are scared, some are defiant, more than half are drunk 
or under the influence of drugs. One young woman brought in by sheriff's 
deputies early Friday evening arrived barefoot, dressed in tight-fitting 
spandex, her face badly bruised. 
</P>
<P>
The woman sat on the cement bench awaiting her pre-booking talk with one of the 
jail's nurses. As she did, she hunched over, burying her face in her lap to 
keep those around her from seeing her face. 
</P>
<P>
For women, the booking process is relatively quick, and most are in a cell bed 
within a few hours. They are questioned about possible medical problems, which 
can run the gamut. Some poor women who are pregnant actually try to get 
arrested in their eighth month, deputies said, so that they can get a doctor to 
examine them. 
</P>
<P>
Once through so-called "medical triage," the women's pockets are emptied and 
they are patted down for hidden weapons and drugs by a deputy wearing white 
latex gloves to protect against AIDS. Their handcuffs are removed and they are 
told to take off their shoes and socks, which are also searched. Next, they are 
interviewed by a "classification deputy" like Monroe, who assigns them a 
color-coded wristband. They are then taken either to the main women's jail in 
Santa Ana, part of the same complex where they are booked, or to one of the 
branch facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In the overcrowded men's system, the process is identical but much more 
time-consuming. After medical triage, it took just a few minutes to uncuff, 
search, photograph and question many of the male inmates brought in Friday, but 
that only marked the beginning of their wait. By midnight, 101 men cooled their 
heels in the first-floor holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest to arrive had been escorted into the jail at 12:24 p.m. Friday. At 
12:05 a.m. on Saturday, he remained in a holding cell, still without a bed. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of a long hall known as "the booking loop," new prisoners 
continued to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Just before midnight, a uniformed Brea police officer accompanied a newly 
arrested suspect to the search area and joked as he handed paperwork to Deputy 
Roger Guevara, who was seated behind a window. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like a suite, please," the officer quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Even from the outside, the discomfort in those glassed-in rooms is obvious. 
Because the holding cells are closely supervised, men inside them are not 
separated by their crimes, so serious felons and petty misdemeanants sit side 
by side. 
</P>
<P>
One neatly dressed man in a wool sweater backed himself into a corner of 
holding cell H6. Arrested on suspicion of drunk driving -- a "deuce," in police 
parlance -- the man was merely in jail long enough to be issued a citation and 
sober up in a medical observation room. But joining him in the seven-man cell 
were a pair of young men whose bulging arms were covered in tattoos extending 
from above their shirt sleeves to their wrists. 
</P>
<P>
They sneered at the deputies across the way. The well-dressed man watched 
nervously. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people get pretty shaken up about being here," said Capt. William Miller, 
who oversees the Intake-Release Center. "They get to meet a whole new bunch of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Once past the booking area, inmates are taken to housing units, where they are 
separated according to their wristbands. In the Intake-Release Center's Mod N, 
192 maximum-security inmates on Friday night exchanged dirty prison clothes for 
clean ones. In his electronically sophisticated control booth, Deputy A. 
Barrera prowled back and forth, watching and summoning prisoners for church 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The cells, though clean, are crowded. Each one has two bunks. The jail is rated 
by the state for a capacity of 384 inmates, but it actually holds 835. 
</P>
<P>
With that many inmates already inside and more always arriving, the scramble 
for beds never stops. 
</P>
<P>
To make room in the jails for serious criminals, the Sheriff's Department has 
practiced a policy known as "cite and release" since 1986. Under that system, 
deputies release misdemeanor offenders with just a citation and instructions to 
appear in court on a certain day. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a system that pleases many of those who are part of it. Judges 
complain that it undercuts the administration of justice, some county officials 
worry about the possible threat to public safety -- though most of those 
inmates released are accused of relatively minor crimes. And sheriff's 
deputies, who are in the business of arresting criminals and getting them off 
the streets, don't like turning around and letting them go. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 91 people booked into the county jail system on the Friday night shift, 
13 were cited and released. Most were gone within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We've released people that we haven't wanted to release," Miller said. "But we 
just keep our fingers crossed that we don't release a violent person or a child 
molester or something." 
</P>
<P>
What it gets the department in return is bed space, which the deputies need to 
accommodate the next wave of prisoners hammering on the Intake-Release Center's 
"back door." For no sooner has one prisoner checked out of the system than 
another is waiting to fill his place. 
</P>
<P>
It's a constant and disheartening cycle, one that shows no signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a carpenter and you build a house, you stand back and see the 
house," Miller said. "The guys here, all they see is the 150 they booked on 
their shift. And tomorrow night it'll be another 150."

NURSE HOPES HER FIRING SUIT HELPS OTHER RESERVISTS 
</P>

Debra M. Simpson, the nurse and National Guard captain who was fired from her 
job at a private Santa Ana health clinic after a hitch of active duty, said 
Saturday that she is suing the clinic partly to protect other reservists who 
leave their civilian jobs during the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this happens more frequently than people realize," said Simpson, who 
was fired last month. "For those that don't have the support or the ability (to 
sue) -- that's why I'm doing this. . . . People who choose to be in a reserve 
unit, they have a right to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes occasionally welling tears, Simpson, 35, said she is suing the Care 
Visions Kangaroo Kids Center also to remove what she believes is a stain on her 
reputation, caused by the firing. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson had worked there for about seven months as a nurse and a health care 
administrator. Her lawsuit was filed last week in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the children's health center did not respond Saturday to 
telephone messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
The center issued a statement Friday, defending the firing of Simpson as the 
clinic's nurse administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern at all times," the statement said, "has been and is the well-being 
of the children in our care." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Simpson was fired because, in the view of management, 
"she was due back to work on Oct. 1 but did not show up or call." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson disagreed, saying that she had told the health clinic's chief executive 
officer twice orally and once in writing that she would not return to work 
until Oct. 3, a Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said she was unable to recover a copy of the written notification, 
because clinic officials told her that they could not find the document. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who lives in Tustin, said she was not aware of any tensions with the 
management of the health center or dissatisfaction with her performance before 
she was called up Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"There didn't seem to be any problems until I returned," Simpson said. "And 
then, an hour after I returned, on the third, I was fired. . . . They then said 
that I was fired for abandonment of position. As an administrator, that's very 
strong language." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said when she first discussed the matter with her bosses, on Aug. 1, 
she envisioned serving a "voluntary" period of active duty. But on Aug. 2, Iraq 
invaded Kuwait, quickly changing the lives of U.S. reservists. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6, Simpson said, her status changed and she was ordered to report. 
</P>
<P>
She said she served the next few weeks in a hospital emergency room in 
Nuremberg, Germany, replacing personnel who had been shifted to the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said she returned to California late on the night of Sept. 29 and did 
not consider it necessary to check in by phone with her clinic bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic officials, in their statement Friday, said they had tried to call 
Simpson and delivered, by courier, a letter to her. Simpson denied receiving a 
letter and said that if attempts were made to call her, they were not recorded 
by her telephone answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said she is receiving "a lot of support" from her National Guard 
colleagues who, like her, worry whether reservists will lose jobs as the United 
States masses troops in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"There are companies out there who are good about it," Simpson said. "But there 
are other companies where it is a struggle."

TRAIN KILLS WORKER AT PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE;

ACCIDENT: ENGINEER COULDN'T STOP IN TIME TO AVOID HITTING CHERRY PICKER 
CARRYING THE MAN, WHO WAS PREPARING TO PAINT OVERPASS IN BUENA PARK.

<P>
A man in a cherry picker working on a pedestrian bridge was fatally injured 
Saturday by an Amtrak train that clipped the construction lift, knocking him 30 
feet to the ground, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim's left leg was severed at the knee in the 8:47 a.m. 
accident, which occurred on the tracks outside Nutrilite Products Inc. The 
company owns the passenger bridge just east of the 5600 block of Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, 22, was taken by helicopter to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where 
he died about 11 a.m., officers said. 
</P>
<P>
His name was not released pending family notification, but police said he lived 
in Paramount and worked for Borbon Inc. Painting and Wall Covering Contractor 
in Buena Park. Company officials were en route to Tijuana, Mexico, to inform 
the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police Lt. Terry Branum said Nutrilite, a vitamin manufacturer, 
contracted with Borbon to paint its bridge, which is 30 to 40 feet high and 
links the company's buildings on either side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
When the accident occurred, Branum said, the victim was preparing the belly of 
the bridge for painting from a lift extending over the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The train was en route to Los Angeles from San Diego and traveling at about 70 
m.p.h. when police said the engineer spotted the workman about 200 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said the engineer blasted his horn and applied the brakes, but the train 
could not stop in time, nor could the man get out of the train's path. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the victim had been told to expect the train and when. 
</P>
<P>
Borbon officials could not be reached for comment, and Branum said there had 
been little or no contact with police. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think someone would be on the lookout so the picker would be 
retracted in time," Branum said. "There is not good visibility there because 
there is a bend (in the track) east of Beach Boulevard that would leave the 
engineer with only 10 or 15 seconds to react." 
</P>
<P>
An Amtrak security officer who asked not to be identified said the train did 
not appear to be traveling at an unusually high rate of speed. 
</P>
<P>
He said the train was delayed 67 minutes at the Buena Park crash site while 
police conducted their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The train arrived in Los Angeles about 10:20 a.m.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TRUE JOURNALIST LOVES TABLOID HOT HEADLINES! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the most respectable, responsible, serious and sober journalists I know 
have a secret appetite for the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
They're outlandish. They're naughty. They're irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
SOURCES REVEAL!!!! Most of my colleagues have at least one tab headline 
memorized. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I'll give you one of my favorites: 'Big Foot Stole My Wife,' " said a 
Times financial writer and sometime devotee of the Weekly World News. "It's a 
story that the big papers missed." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to read them in the checkout stand," said a sportswriter, who remembers 
lurid headlines like so many baseball stats. "My favorite recent one had a 
picture of a chunky bald-headed woman, and it said, 'Strange Disease Makes 
Women Look like Kojak.' 
</P>
<P>
"The best one is, how'd it go? . . . Oh yeah: 'Man With Two Tongues Speaks Two 
Languages at the Same Time." 
</P>
<P>
He picked up the phone and dialed a friend for a quick fact check. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Man's Eyes Stolen in Sleep.' Yup, that's a good one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even my editor is an addict. This is his current favorite: "HITLER CAPTURED! 
Nazi madman trapped on way to Iraq to help Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
EXCLUSIVE!!!!! Sometimes the tabs even print genuine news stories -- from their 
own inimitable angle. 
</P>
<P>
Murder, for example. It's usually gory and always in bad taste. But respectable 
newspapers are not supposed to make their readers gag at breakfast. Our tabloid 
antiheroes are under no such constraints. First prize goes to the New York 
Post: "Headless Body in Topless Bar." 
</P>
<P>
I never noticed the tabloids until I became a reporter. I got hooked in my very 
first newsroom. It was New York City, and after deadline, the reporters would 
sit around trying to predict the Post headline for the next day. We never came 
close. My favorite was when Mayor Ed Koch caught a mugger red-handed. The Post 
titled its picture of the gleeful mayor: "Kotcha!" 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, the tabloids cover a story with a zest and flair that more 
buttoned-down publications can only envy. An editorial page editor remembers 
New York City grinding to a halt the day a mountain climber scaled the World 
Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an incredible story. The whole city literally stopped," he said. "And 
the Daily News ran a huge picture on Page One with a huge headline, 'HUMAN 
FLY!' 
</P>
<P>
"It was really like right out of the Daily Planet." 
</P>
<P>
Serious newspapers are supposed to be objective. But the tabs can do political 
commentary on Page One -- as long as it's funny. Remember the headline when 
President Ford refused to help New York out of bankruptcy? "Ford to City: Drop 
Dead." 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed since then. This September, Air Force Gen. Michael J. 
Dugan was fired for telling reporters details of U.S. contingency plans for a 
surgical strike against Saddam Hussein. The Chicago Sun-Times weighed in with a 
headline that was, well, open to misinterpretation: "Air Head Fired." 
</P>
<P>
UNBELIEVABLE . . . BUT TRUE!!!! Some people deny ever plunking down a quarter 
for the junk food of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't read them. I truly don't read them. Honestly, I don't," said a 25-year 
hard-news veteran, who admits only to an occasional bout with People magazine. 
"But I do look at them while I'm standing in line." 
</P>
<P>
I have no shame. My favorite Sunday mornings are spent lazing over the New York 
Times, Los Angeles Times and Weekly World News for comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I like the tabs because some days the reality I write about is so 
depressing -- or so messy -- that I wish I could just make up a simpler 
version. As the sportswriter put it, the tabs are a primer in "how to condense 
and distort reality in 10 words or less." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the thrill of seeing wrongdoing go unpunished. I mean, how do they 
get away with it? 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it's nostalgia for the grubby romance of the old newspaper days, when 
hard-drinking men could stamp out their cigarettes on the newsroom floor. That 
was long before my time, and they didn't let women join the fun. Nowadays, we 
have carpeted newsrooms, drug testing and female bylines on Page One. But I 
imagine those tabloid reporters still get to wear fedoras. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people read them more than they admit to," said a Times copy editor. 
She is a meticulous person who hates sloppy grammar and half-baked facts. But 
she has a huge tabloid photo of a 167-pound baby taped up behind her computer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to tell people I bought the Enquirer, but sometimes you just have 
to."

SCR DIRECTOR SAYS ARTS IN COUNTY NEED UNIFIED VOICE 
</P>

Recent controversies in Costa Mesa over artistic freedom were aggravated by the 
lack of a countywide arts organization, David Emmes, producing-artistic 
director of Costa Mesa's Tony award-winning South Coast Repertory theater, said 
here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a countywide arts council, which would give a stronger, unified 
voice to the local arts community, contributed to "a lack of understanding" 
among Costa Mesa city officials last July when they approved hotly contested 
arts-grant restrictions, said Emmes, speaking on a panel at a meeting of arts 
leaders from throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, we must be very active in communicating on a local level about 
the importance of the arts and why we do what we do," Emmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's panel, titled "The Fight for Freedom of Expression," was held at the 
Biltmore Hotel as part of the annual convention of the California Confederation 
of the Arts, the state's largest arts advocacy organization. About 100 people 
attended the discussion, opened by choreographer Bella Lewitzky, head of the 
Los Angeles modern dance company that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle (for freedom of expression) is never won and one that may never 
rest," said Lewitzky, who has sued the National Endowment for the Arts over its 
requirement that recipients of 1990 grants pledge not to create or present 
obscene artworks. 
</P>
<P>
SCR, a recipient of Costa Mesa arts subsidies, was pushed into the nationwide 
furor over public arts funding when a Costa Mesa resident charged that the 
troupe had used city funds to distribute flyers urging support of the NEA, 
under fire by conservatives for funding allegedly obscene or sacrilegious 
works. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council found that no city money had been used to produce 
the flyers, but nonetheless imposed grant restrictions, forbidding the use of 
city money for obscene works, as well as for religious or political activity. 
Arts experts say they are unaware of any other city or county in the country 
that enacted similar restrictions as a result of the NEA debate. The national 
controversy over arts funding is expected to continue in light of recent 
legislation that bars NEA support of work that violates "general standards of 
decency." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to strengthen and centralize the local arts community, Orange County 
arts officials have been working to form a countywide arts council. They 
suffered a setback earlier this year after the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors virtually shut the door on any substantial funding for such an 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
A somewhat similar coalition in Long Beach, the 8-year-old Public Corporation 
for the Arts, has long been active in the sort of public awareness efforts that 
Emmes advocated through an Orange County arts council, said panelist Cynthia 
MacMullin, director of the FHP Hippodrome Gallery in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've solicited the support of the (Long Beach) City Council and it has been 
very supportive in the NEA battle," MacMullin said. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Bruce W. Davis said that the Arts Democratic Club in San Francisco has 
gained local politicians' support. In the last election, four out of five 
supervisors endorsed by the club were elected, said Davis, club vice president, 
as were all of the three school board members. In addition, "every single 
person up for judicial posts and the college board had to come for our 
endorsement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of the arts to move society, to move people, frightens politicians 
-- it scares them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Jane Sharp, a board member of the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse, admitted 
that playhouse officials had been "extremely naive" to stage the satiric play 
"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All To You" shortly after imposition of the 
Costa Mesa arts-grant restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Durang's caustic satire, labeled as "anti-Christian bigotry" by 
local residents, reignited the city's arts-funding flap and offered the first 
test of the new Costa Mesa grant policy. The playhouse, a community theater run 
mostly by volunteers, also receives city funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no pleasure to admit we were stupid enough not to know we'd cause such a 
ruckus," Sharp said after the meeting. She stressed that she spoke as an 
individual, not for the playhouse board which did not have enough time to 
prepare a statement because it had been invited only Tuesday to speak.

POLICE SEEKING SUSPECTS IN 2 SHOOTING DEATHS;

<P>
SLAYINGS: THE WEEKEND HOMICIDES IN ANAHEIM AND GARDEN GROVE WERE UNRELATED.

<P>
Police were searching for suspects in separate weekend shootings in Anaheim and 
Garden Grove that left two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 p.m. Friday, police found a 26-year-old Anaheim man on the floor of his 
bedroom in the 1200 block of Moraga Street. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Martin Joseph Berryman. He was pronounced dead at 
the scene from a gunshot wound in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that an unidentified man carrying a shotgun entered 
Berryman's home unannounced and walked to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief exchange, the suspect, described as in his mid-20s, fired one 
round and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said it was not known what prompted the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove, a 25-year-old man was shot at least twice in the chest about 6 
p.m. Friday. Police said the victim, identified as Dung Hoang Chau of Garden 
Grove, had just parked his car in the carport of an apartment complex with his 
girlfriend in the 9000 block of Biola Lane when two men in a white Nissan 
Maxima parked nearby called out to Chau. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Chau reportedly walked up to the car and was shot in the chest. The 
suspects then fled. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Woods said it was not known whether the suspects referred to Chau by 
name. Woods said Chau's girlfriend was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Chau was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange where he died at 11:45 p.m.

BATTLE OF BADS PROVES TITANS ARE THE WORST

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton hit ground zero Saturday, losing to New Mexico State, 43-9, 
and snatching the title of "Worst Division I-A Team in America" from the 
Aggies' mantel. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State was ranked 106th out of 106 Division I-A teams by The 
National, an all-sports publication. The Aggies will surely vacate the bottom 
spot and Fullerton, which entered at No. 105, has the U-Haul in the driveway 
and is ready to move in. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about as low as it gets," Titan defensive back Terry Tramble said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin: "It's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 19,227 in Aggie Memorial Stadium saw New Mexico State (1-10) score 
24 points in the fourth quarter to break open a 19-9 game. Aggie quarterback 
David Chisum, a former Sunny Hills High School and Fullerton College standout, 
completed his first 11 passes en route to a 19-for-31, 288-yard, two-touchdown 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
That helped New Mexico State stop a 27-game losing streak, which began in 
October, 1988. It was the Aggies' first victory at home since Oct. 24, 1987, 
and their first Big West Conference victory since they beat Fullerton in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the second game of the 1983 season, when New Mexico 
State beat Louisiana Tech, 15-7, that the Aggies held an opponent under 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State entered with the nation's longest Division I-A losing streak. 
The Titans, who have lost 11 straight since a season-opening victory over 
Sonoma State, left with longest Division I-A losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about it," Titan Coach Gene Murphy said. "I'm a competitive son 
of a . . . and as long as you're a player or coach, this better eat you up 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
First-year New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess might have felt more relieved than 
elated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous burden every time we read in the paper that we had the 
longest losing streak," Hess said. "It feels very good to pass that on to 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
After beating Fullerton in 1986, then-New Mexico State Coach Mike Knoll led the 
Aggies and their fans on a victory lap around the stadium to commemorate their 
first conference victory. But that was tame compared to Saturday's postgame 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State fans tore down both goal posts and carried them around the 
field. The Aggies' victory bell, which had been collecting dust for two years, 
rang long and loud. 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't the only strange occurrences in Aggie Memorial Stadium, though. 
In what had to be an unofficial school record, New Mexico State was penalized 
not once, but twice, for excessive celebrations in the end zone in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And the Aggies' defense, which had six sacks in 10 previous games, made several 
appearances in the Titans' backfield, sacking Paul Schulte four times for a 
loss of 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State rolled up 514 total yards, including 168 rushing by Jimmie 
Mitchell, compared to Fullerton's 257. The Aggies maintained possession for 
almost 10 minutes more than the Titans, 34:56-25:04. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans didn't look too good when they had the ball. Schulte, who missed 
last week's game because of a bruised kidney, overthrew many receivers, some 
passes were dropped, and Fullerton couldn't come up with any big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised they moved the ball and scored, but I'm surprised we 
didn't," Murphy said. "Our offense didn't execute like it's capable of. We 
didn't play with intensity and we didn't make things happen. Schulte didn't 
play with any flow, rhythm or continuity. He has played better." 
</P>
<P>
If this season left a sour taste in the mouths of Titan players and coaches, 
then the fourth quarter Saturday must have had them gagging. 
</P>
<P>
After Mitchell's second touchdown, a 13-yard run, gave New Mexico State a 26-9 
lead, Titan freshman Dwayne McAfee tried to field the ensuing kickoff near the 
sideline. He bobbled the ball and went out of bounds at the three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, the usually reliable Nevin shanked an 11-yard punt that went 
out of bounds at the Titan 19. Dat Ly then kicked a 32-yard field goal -- the 
40th of his career and a school record -- to give New Mexico State a 29-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Brian Carter intercepted a Schulte pass and returned it 
72 yards for a touchdown, and the Aggies closed scoring with Billy Borten's 
31-yard touchdown run with 2:29 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"That fourth quarter seemed like a week and a half if you ask me," Titan safety 
Bob Baiz said. "It's been a long season, and that's not the way we wanted it to 
end." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans didn't think it would end like this. Many players said they came out 
of a team meeting at their hotel Friday night feeling confident they would end 
the season on a high note. 
</P>
<P>
"We seemed to have our minds set on winning, but they (New Mexico State) just 
wanted it more than we did," Fullerton offensive tackle Mike Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Titans have to live with the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between being last in your conference and last in the 
country," Simmons said. "But that's the title we hold. It hurts, and it's a 
tough thing to deal with. But sometimes things happen like that." 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell how damaging this season is to the egos of returning players, 
but the Titans weren't feeling too good about themselves Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As Fullerton players were boarding the bus, a young boy asked freshman 
cornerback Terry Sullivan for his autograph, to which Sullivan replied, "Are 
you sure you want it?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old student from an area high school was injured in the post-game 
celebration when his left hand was caught between the crossbar and an upright 
as fans were bending the goal posts back and forth. New Mexico State campus 
police were told that the youth had severed a finger in the accident, and they 
spent some time searching the field for the finger. But according to Lee 
Golden, a nurse in the emergency ward at Memorial General Hospital in Las 
Cruces, the youth's finger, although broken, remained on the hand. The hospital 
later notified campus police, who called off the search. . . . New Mexico State 
quarterback David Chisum, the former Sunny Hills High School and Fullerton 
College standout, set a record for completions in a season Saturday. He 
finished with 187 completions, surpassing Joe Pisarcik's 182 in 1972. Chisum 
said he knew it would be the Aggies' day when they drove 87 yards for a 
touchdown on their first possession. "Right from the first drive, we were 
playing happy and loose," Chisum said. "This was the best we've executed all 
year." . . . Fullerton's points came on Phil Nevin's 47-yard field goal in the 
second quarter and Reggie Yarbrough's two-yard run in the third. Yarbrough, a 
junior, finished with 101 yards on 20 carries and closed the season with 1,014 
yards to become the fifth Titan to rush for 1,000 yards or more in a season. . 
. . Nevin, despite his 11-yard punt in the fourth quarter, finished with a 
40-yard average on eight punts.

MIKE PENNER: EARTH TO BIG WEST: BASKETBALL'S YOUR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Hapless Bowl '90 is over, and we have a loser. It wasn't even close -- Cal 
State Fullerton under New Mexico State, 9-43, snapping the Aggies' amazing 
streak of consecutive losses at 27 and leaving the Titans all alone atop the 
Division I-A football rankings, assuming you're looking at them standing on 
your head. 
</P>
<P>
They're No. 106. 
</P>
<P>
Out of deference to Gene Murphy, we'll cut the one-liners there. Murphy is a 
good coach who deserves much, much better. 
</P>
<P>
But a crossroads was reached Saturday in Las Cruces, and it raises a question 
that deserves immediate attention, along with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about Fullerton dropping football. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about the Big West Conference dropping its football fixation. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West has been flogging a dead horse for years, pretending to play 
grown-up football without the money, the resources, the players and the 
facilities necessary just to scrape together the dream. When Big West football 
is bad, it is as bad as it gets. No one in the Big West can be proud of 
Saturday's Fullerton-New Mexico State fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
But even when Big West football is good, no one takes it seriously. Saturday, 
the Big West also staged its championship game -- Fresno State vs. San Jose 
State for a trip to the California Raisin Bowl for the thrill and prestige of 
getting to face . . . Central Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Hurry, get those tickets today. 
</P>
<P>
You'd accuse the Big West of fooling itself, except it consigned itself to 
national obscurity by agreeing to the bowl tie-in with the Mid-American 
Conference in the first place. Today, that's how the rest of the country views 
Big West football -- the Toledos and the Ball States of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the sport braced for the dawning of the Age of the Super 
Conference, Big West football has hit a wall it is never going to ascend or 
obliterate. It is time the Big West faced facts, called off the sham, cut its 
losses and let San Jose State and Fresno State go free. 
</P>
<P>
It is time the Big West went the way of the Big East: 
</P>
<P>
Basketball first, second and third . . . and let the football programs fall 
where they may. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Big West has a first-in-a-lifetime opportunity to capitalize on 
an NCAA basketball championship, even if Nevada Las Vegas can't. Last April, 
after UNLV nuked Duke in Denver, the Big West grabbed the nation's attention at 
last. If it wants to keep it -- and the Big West has two more top 25-type 
programs at New Mexico State and Cal State Long Beach -- it had better do 
something about its football-and-chain. 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose and Fresno, the Big West has two viable, thriving, year-in and 
year-out legitimate Division I-A football programs. It used to have three, but 
San Diego State got smart and jumped to the WAC in 1978. San Jose and Fresno 
are making noises about testing the same waters, and the Big West would do best 
to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, without San Jose and Fresno, Big West football would have to be 
reclassified Division I-AA. So let it. There's nothing wrong with playing 
Division I-AA football. Some of Gene Murphy's best friends play Division I-AA 
football. Playing Division I-AA football doesn't make you a bad person. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton would have room to breathe and grow in Division I-AA. So would New 
Mexico State and Long Beach, which needed a PR gimmick as outlandish as George 
Allen to resuscitate its program. 
</P>
<P>
How could that be any less desirable than the current state of affairs, with 
five of the Big West's eight football-playing schools unable to crack the top 
90? Before Saturday, one national poll had the University of the Pacific at No. 
91, followed by Long Beach at 93, UNLV at 98 and the Fullerton-New Mexico 
anchor at 105 and 106. 
</P>
<P>
The conference clearly sought to emulate the Big East in 1988 when it changed 
its name from the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. The name has caught on, helping 
the Big West garner equal billing with the Big East and the Big 10 on ESPN's 
periodic "Big Monday" basketball triple-headers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it should take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
The Big East is a conference with its priorities in order. It exists for 
basketball, first and foremost, and is regarded as the heaviest of all college 
basketball heavyweights, depending on how one feels about the ACC at a given 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Big East schools also play football -- on three levels. Boston College, 
Pittsburgh and Syracuse are Division I-A independents. Connecticut and 
Villanova are members of the Division I-AA Yankee Conference. Georgetown and 
St. John's play Division III football. 
</P>
<P>
Break up the Big West the same way. Let San Jose and Fresno joust their 
big-time windmills as either football independents or part-time WAC tack-ons. 
If UNLV wants to follow, fine. Group the others under a Division I-AA heading, 
with maybe Cal State Northridge thrown in, so that the pigskin heads can keep 
their football while the conference can be called something other than the Big 
Drain. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of dollars will be saved. Imagine what that could mean to 
Big West basketball: Better recruiting. Better arenas. Better names on the home 
schedule. How about UCLA at Fullerton instead of, as always, the other way 
around? 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, someday, a Big East-Big West Challenge, with Georgetown-UC Irvine at 
the Bren Center. OK, OK, bad example. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, someday, a Big East-Big West Challenge, with Syracuse-Long Beach at 
the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
There. 
</P>
<P>
It could happen here. 
</P>
<P>
Big West basketball is closer to prime time than it has ever been before. The 
final leap isn't unfathomable. Unlike football, basketball programs can make 
major strides in a hurry, and with the exception of Irvine, every Big West 
school has been to the NCAA Tournament at least once since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing standing in the way of Big West basketball is Big West football. 
</P>
<P>
Sacrifice the Hapless Bowl for more trips to the Final Four.

ON THE PREP PATH: ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRANDE HAVE KEPT HIM FROM RIGHTFUL PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Brande should be too hoarse to speak this morning. His voice should be 
as gravelly as a dry riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
His vocal cords should be paying the price for all the ranting, raving, 
cheering and praising he should have been doing from the Corona del Mar bench 
Saturday night while the Sea Kings won the Southern Section 5-A girls' 
volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Brande was not on the bench. He was in the stands, passively -- helplessly 
-- watching the team that was taken away from him just a few days before the 
season began this fall. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 24, Brande was fired as Corona del Mar's girls' and boys' volleyball 
coach. Corona del Mar officials say it is because Brande, perhaps the most 
successful coach in Orange County youth volleyball history, is under 
investigation by the Southern Section for allegations relating to the club 
teams he coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Section rules prohibit coaches from working with players -- except during the 
summer and the regular high school season -- when those players have high 
school eligibility remaining. The allegations made against Brande contend he 
violated this rule. 
</P>
<P>
Brande, 43, has coached youth teams since the mid-1970s -- his Orange County 
Volleyball Club is one of the nation's best. He says what he is doing now is no 
different than what he'd done before -- coached high school and club volleyball 
while staying within the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to Brande -- along with his adversaries -- say Brande has his 
faults, but cheating is not one of them. Brande, they say, is one of the most 
hard-driving coaches in the sport -- in practice, he occasionally has driven 
players to tears -- and one who demands discipline and emotional control. The 
result is a long tradition of mentally tough teams. 
</P>
<P>
But unethical practices are not within Brande's nature. A Milli Vanilli he is 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Charlie for 10 to 12 years, he can be very intense and very 
demanding," said Steve George, who coaches the Santa Barbara Youth Volleyball 
Assn. "But he also has tremendous integrity. I don't think he would ever 
cheat." 
</P>
<P>
Brande is alleged to have coached players on his club team with remaining 
eligibility, but most say he goes to almost ridiculous lengths to avoid even 
the appearance of such a practice. In the Orange County Volleyball Club's 
organization, Brande coaches the seniors, while four assistant coaches work 
with the younger levels. 
</P>
<P>
One of the allegations, Brande said, was based on a newspaper photo showing him 
standing with the club's junior team, supposedly proving that he did, in fact, 
coach several of his players with remaining eligibility. But the photo was 
taken in July, a month when there are no restrictions on coaching players with 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Volleyball Club Coach Dale Flickinger, who took over the Corona del 
Mar team as interim coach at Brande's request, said that during a club 
tournament in Santa Barbara, Brande's senior team was scheduled to play one of 
the Orange Co. Volleyball Club's junior teams in a match. Brande cleared his 
participation ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie went up to the commissioner of the region and the tournament director 
before the match and said, 'I need your opinion. Do you think I'll be violating 
a CIF rule here if I coach this match?' " said Flickinger, who drives from his 
job in Torrance every day to coach the Sea Kings. "I'm sorry, but I don't think 
a lot of coaches would do that. That's why I drive 40 miles to support this 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Mohs, who has coached volleyball at Edison for 21 years and whose two 
daughters played for Brande at Corona del Mar, says he thinks Brande is being 
used as a political pawn. Mohs contends Corona del Mar Principal Tom Jacobson, 
the president of the Southern Section's council, might be using Brande's case 
as a way of building his reputation and proving he plays by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Jacobson is probably using this as a stepladder for himself," Mohs said. 
"Jacobson's made a big thing out of it. I really feel he just wants to get out 
of being a principal and get into a higher position in the CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, principal at Newport Harbor until the Newport-Mesa School District 
ordered him and Dennis Evans to switch schools several years ago, has 
repeatedly refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section scheduled a hearing for Brande, but it has been postponed 
four times. It's now scheduled Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"The season will be over by then anyway," Brande said. "It's a no-win 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
And for high school volleyball, losing Brande is a no-win situation as well.

A RASPBERRY SAUCE WELL WORTH SAVORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spooned over or under a dessert (and especially a low-fat one), raspberry sauce 
is an enormous enhancement. And since it freezes well, it's easy to keep on 
hand for use at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
Here are two quick sauce recipes. One version is made with fresh berries and no 
sugar. The other version can be made year-round with frozen raspberries in 
syrup. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH RASPBERRY-STRAWBERRY SAUCE: 
</P>
<P>
In food processor or blender, puree 1 pint hulled strawberries with 1/2 pint 
raspberries until all pulp is removed from seeds, about 1 minute. Press through 
fine sieve to remove seeds. Add 2 to 4 tablespoons raspberry fruit spread 
(sugarless) until sauce is sweetened and thickened to taste. Makes about 2 2/3 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
FROZEN RASPBERRY SAUCE: 
</P>
<P>
In food processor or blender, puree thawed 10-ounce package frozen raspberries 
in syrup (preferably light) until all pulp is removed from seeds, about 30 
seconds. Press through fine sieve to remove seeds. Add powdered sugar to taste 
and 1 tablespoon raspberry or blackberry liqueur, if desired. Makes about 1 1/4 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
FREEZING TIP: 
</P>
<P>
If using small amounts of sauce, freeze sauce in plastic ice cube trays. Once 
frozen, pop cubes out and freeze them, wrapped airtight in plastic bags. 
Individual servings of raspberry sauce will always be available. ABBY MANDEL

ITALIAN DESSERTS: BEYOND TIRAMISU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Malgieri didn't feel like a stranger even on his first visit to Italy in 
1973. "My grandmother had talked of so many places and people -- I already knew 
so much." He didn't anticipate, however, the reaction to some of the Italian 
expressions he used. "People cracked up because I was talking in a dialect of 
their grandparents -- one no longer even spoken." 
</P>
<P>
Malgieri's grandmother, Clotilde Lo Conte, grew up in the village of 
Grottaminarda. After moving to this country, she lived with the Malgieris; 
because she spoke so little English, her grandson became bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
Although basically a simple, rustic Southern Italian cook, Malgieri's 
mammanonna had learned baking from a retired Neapolitan pastry chef. Desserts 
were her greatest glory and influenced her grandson's decision to become a 
pastry chef. 
</P>
<P>
Since that first visit 17 years ago, Malgieri has returned to Italy many times. 
During his travels from Sicily to Milan he collected recipes -- many thus far 
unknown outside Italy -- from professional chefs and home cooks. He has 
compiled these pastries in "Great Italian Desserts" (Little, Brown &amp; Co., 
1990: $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
Malgieri's greatest wish "is to see the wonderful Italian baking tradition take 
its rightful place beside the French and Viennese schools as one of Europe's 
and the world's most refined." He hopes this will be a ground-breaking book, 
introducing Americans to this concept. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening, Malgieri makes the following comments about authenticity: 
"Italian cooking and baking have undergone waves of foreign influence over the 
course of centuries, so that elements of cuisines from France, England, North 
Africa, Yugoslavia, Austria and, most recently, the United States have all left 
their mark." 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Malgieri says, "to define an 'authentic' Italian recipe 
presents a few problems. Must it have originated in Italy, free of foreign 
influence? This would, of course, eliminate last week's adaptation of a cake 
from a French magazine, but it would also eliminate the Sicilian version of 
Moroccan couscous, Neapolitan Krapfen, derived from German and Austrian 
carnival fritters, and Milanese fruit tarts in the French style." 
</P>
<P>
In light of this, he has documented the recipes with names, places and 
background facts, but has adapted them to readily available American 
ingredients and created some desserts that are Italian in style, although he 
has not actually found them in his travels. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter on basic ingredients and recipes gives recommendations and 
substitutions, along with some recipes that are important foundations of 
authentic Italian desserts: Zuccata (homemade candied fruit), homemade ricotta, 
mascarpone (Italian cream cheese) and vino cotto (cooked wine). 
</P>
<P>
Remaining chapters are broken down by types of desserts, and each includes 
background material and hints for success. Many of the recipes have been used 
by Malgieri in cooking classes during the past 10 years, and his teaching 
experience is evident in the detailed directions and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one drawback to the book, it is the lack of photographs other than 
on the cover jacket. Illustrations by Christine Buhr, however, are helpful in 
demonstrating some of the more complicated techniques.

UNTRADITIONAL THANKSGIVING SWEETS

<P>
My family, knowing my taste for innovation, began querying me weeks ago to make 
sure I wasn't planning any Thanksgiving surprises. They will not be denied 
their yam and apple casserole, their creamed spinach, their chestnut dressing 
and celery root salad. What they want for Thanksgiving is culinary continuity. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to dessert, however, my family is a little more flexible. They 
usually let me repeat one favorite and then try out a few new recipes. 
</P>
<P>
I've found that the desserts that follow work well together, although each is 
also delicious on its own. The glazed Maple-Pecan-Apple Crisp With Cinnamon Ice 
Cream and Spiced Pumpkin Cake with Rich Caramel Sauce are homey, comfortable 
desserts. The Orange Sorbet With Saffron is brilliantly colored and remarkably 
refreshing, offering a satisfying light, low-fat option to those who prefer it. 
</P>
<P>
What these desserts share, luckily, is the ability to be prepared in advance. 
After all, what a cook needs on Thanksgiving Day is lots of time for tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 This is indeed a "crisp." A maple syrup butter sauce is drizzled over the top 
toward the end of baking, forming a lusciously thin crust. The apples are on 
the tart side, contrasting with the sweet crust. Serve it warm with Cinnamon 
Ice Cream. 
</P>
<P>
MAPLE-PECAN-APPLE CRISP WITH CINNAMON ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
7 large tart apples (about 3 pounds), peeled, thinly sliced (about 8 cups 
sliced) 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon maple flavoring 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 cup minus 1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
1 cup pecans, roughly chopped, toasted 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon unsalted butter or margarine, cut in small pieces 
</P>
<P>
Crumb Topping 
</P>
<P>
8 pecan halves 
</P>
<P>
Maple Syrup Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Ice Cream 
</P>
<P>
Toss apple slices with lemon juice and maple flavoring. Combine cinnamon, 
flour, brown sugar, salt, pecans and butter in small dish. Add to apples and 
toss well to combine. Mound apples in 6-cup deep-dish pie plate (they will 
deflate as they cook). 
</P>
<P>
Distribute Crumb Topping evenly over apples. Press gently into place with your 
hands. Place dish on baking sheet. Bake in center of oven at 350 degrees until 
deeply browned, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Remove apple crisp from oven. Place pecan halves in attractive pattern on top. 
Drizzle Maple Syrup Sauce evenly over pecans and surface of crisp. Bake 10 
minutes longer. Let cool on rack. 
</P>
<P>
Reheat in 350-degree oven, uncovered, until warmed through, about 15 minutes. 
Serve warm with Cinnamon Ice Cream. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To toast pecans, spread single layer on baking sheet and bake in 
350-degree oven until it becomes fragrant and color deepens, about 7 to 10 
minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Toasted pecans can be frozen several 
months, wrapped airtight. 
</P>
<P>
Crumb Topping 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, room temperature, cut into 6 pieces 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon maple flavoring 
</P>
<P>
Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, flour and salt in food processor or mixing bowl. 
Add butter and maple flavoring. Cut into flour with metal blade or pastry 
blender until mixture is crumbly. 
</P>
<P>
Maple Syrup Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Bring maple syrup to boil, uncovered, in small saucepan until slightly 
thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter until blended. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Ice Cream 
</P>
<P>
1 pint vanilla ice cream, slightly softened 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Dash allspice 
</P>
<P>
Put ice cream in mixing bowl. Use wooden spoon to mix until smooth but not 
runny. Add cinnamon and allspice. Combine well. Pack into airtight container 
and freeze. Let soften slightly before serving. Makes 1 pint. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm and mellow-flavored, this spiced pumpkin cake is a most delicious dessert 
sauced with the Butter-Rich Caramel Sauce, which is not overly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
WARM PUMPKIN SPICE CAKE WITH BUTTER-RICH CARAMEL SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 cups cake flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
3 large eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
1 1/3 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup unsalted butter or margarine, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons bourbon 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups canned solid-pack pumpkin 
</P>
<P>
Spiced Sugar 
</P>
<P>
Butter-Rich Caramel Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Sift together cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and 
allspice. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
With mixer or food processor, cream egg yolks, sugar and butter until light and 
fluffy. Add bourbon, buttermilk and pumpkin. Mix until smooth, scraping down 
sides. Add flour to mixer and mix until combined. If using food processor, 
transfer batter to a mixing bowl. Use wooden spoon to combine flour with batter 
until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Using mixer, Beat egg whites until soft peaks form but are still moist. Stir 
1/4 egg whites into batter. Fold in remaining whites. Transfer batter to 
greased and floured 12 to 14-cup bundt pan. Tap pan on counter several times to 
settle batter. Cut through batter with knife to remove remaining air bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
Bake in center of oven at 350 degrees about 55 minutes, or until lightly 
browned and wood pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan 5 
minutes, then gently invert onto cooling rack. Sieve Spiced Sugar over surface 
of cake. Serve warm with warm Butter-Rich Caramel Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Makes 1 large bundt cake. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Cake can be made day ahead and kept at room temperature, covered 
airtight. Can also be frozen as long as 3 months, wrapped airtight. To serve, 
replace cake in clean bundt pan. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees until 
warmed through, about 15 minutes. Or warm, uncovered, in microwave oven on 
microwaveable serving plate at MEDIUM (50% power) until just warm (not 
steamed), about 3 to 4 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Spiced Sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Combine powdered sugar with allspice and cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
Butter-Rich Caramel Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons dark corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, 1/2 cup whipping cream and salt in heavy 1 
1/2-quart saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Let boil, uncovered, 
until thickened (there will be large, deep bubbles) and deeper tan color, about 
11 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup whipping 
cream. Bring to boil, stirring until smooth, about 30 seconds. Serve warm. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Sauce can be made several days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat in double 
boiler or microwave oven.

 Chef Allen Sternweiler offers this extraordinary sorbet on the menu at 
Printer's Row Restaurant in Chicago. The saffron works two ways: It enhances 
the orange color while adding an interesting nuance of flavor. For a dessert 
buffet, serve the sorbet scooped into small hollowed out orange or lemon halves 
(which can be assembled and frozen in advance), garnished with a few saffron 
threads or fresh mint leaf at serving time. When served in glass goblets, 
garnish with fresh orange segments. A splash of Champagne is a most festive 
touch. 
</P>
<P>

AL TAYEBET'S WONDERFUL THINGS: SOUR CHERRIES AND SUJUK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Al-Tayebat Middle Eastern Grocery, 1217 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim, (714) 
520-4723. Open Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arabic, Al-Tayebat means wonderful things. It's a fitting name for a market 
with butchers who make lamb sausages studded with pine nuts and hand-cut shish 
kebabs to order from fresh sides of halal lamb. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't buy precut meat," says Al-Tayebat's owner, Sami Khouraki, who comes 
from a family of Syrian merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Tayebat carries the fresh seasonal herbs, fruits and vegetables used in 
Middle Eastern cooking: eggplants the size of your thumb, 2-foot-long 
pale-green English butter gourd and the tart, unripe grapes and sour red 
cherries used for flavoring Iranian meat dishes. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to cook Syrian, Lebanese or Iranian food to appreciate the 
store's conventional produce. I found Spanish saffron, shimmering green 
Lebanese extra-virgin olive oil and sour cherry preserves from a Belgian 
company, thick with whole fruit. And on the day I was there, five kinds of 
pears were displayed. One flaming scarlet variety was fully ripe and juicy -- a 
rare occurrence these days. There were also huge red grapes the size of walnuts 
and pencil-thin yellow wax beans. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning at 3:30, Khouraki, a former manager for the K mart Corp., drives 
downtown to the Los Angeles Central Produce Market, although his store is 
located in Anaheim. He prefers to select the produce himself rather than having 
it delivered sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
And he has the butchers in Al-Tayebat's modest meat department prepare kufta to 
each customer's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people like their kufta seasoned with hot pepper, others prefer sweet 
pepper or cinnamon," Khouraki says. "And though lamb is traditional, we also 
get calls to make it with beef." 
</P>
<P>
Culinarily speaking, the Middle East begins in the Balkans and extends right up 
to the edge of India, dipping down to Northern Africa. And though each country 
has its distinct cuisine, Al-Tayebat caters to them all. These countries use 
similar ingredients, and their tables have long been a product of cultural 
exchange prompted by the comings and goings of pilgrims, trade caravans and 
invaders. Certain staples are widespread, such as lamb, wheat, rice, eggplant 
and olives. 
</P>
<P>
So the plump, fresh walnut halves behind Al-Tayebat's counter might end up in 
Lebanese baklava or a Georgian satsivi (cold chicken with a spicy walnut 
sauce); the filo dough may wrap Greek tiropita or Yugoslavia's meat borek, and 
the small eggplants could be stuffed with walnuts and then pickled to make 
Syrian beitinjan makbus or sauteed for a Turkish rice pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
When you shop at Al-Tayebat, take a shopping basket rather than try to 
manipulate a cart through the store's narrow aisles -- although carts won't be 
a problem much longer. Khouraki has acquired the adjoining property, and the 
remodeled store will nearly double the space for Al-Tayebat's wonderful things. 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING LIST: 
</P>
<P>
 Halal lamb: The fine-quality lamb carried at Al-Tayebat is halal -- which 
means it has been butchered according to Islamic religious prescriptions. You 
can purchase whole or half lambs for roasting and perhaps to stuff in the 
traditional Greek or Armenian way. 
</P>
<P>
If you need less meat, the butcher will bone a leg of lamb with a pocket to 
hold stuffing. Each country has its own stuffing recipes. In Syria and Lebanon 
it's likely to be a simple combination of garlic and herbs or a more elaborate 
one of chopped figs, raisins and prunes (about 2 ounces each) with 1/2 teaspoon 
each of dried thyme and sage and sprinkled with a little melted butter. The 
stuffed pocket must be tied shut before the meat is roasted. 
</P>
<P>
Another specialty Al-Tayebat's customers might have the butchers prepare is 
meat for Chelo Kebab: lamb cut into wide strips, to be marinated in yogurt or 
lemon juice and olive oil. After a charcoal grilling, the meat may be served 
with rice that has been cooked so that it has a crisp crust at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb is also the main ingredient in many of the famous Iranian stews known as 
khoresh. The ingredients in a khoresh, which can include fruit and nuts or 
pomegranate juice, make a lush sauce. And the khoresh is always served over a 
huge mound of fragrant basmati-style rice to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
Ma'ani: These lamb sausages are made in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent (the 
pronunciation of the name varies from region to region -- in written Arabic 
it's naqaniq). Khouraki is justifiably proud of the shop's small, finger-length 
ma'ani scented with a seasoning that includes allspice, cloves and pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Sujuk: This is the Turkish- and Armenian-style cured beef sausage. Most 
Armenian-Middle Eastern delis sell commercially made sujuk. Al-Tayebat's 
butchers prepare their own, which is not cured as long. As a result, the 
sausage is pleasantly moist. Saute chunks of the sujuk and toss it with cut 
tomatoes for an appetizer, or use it in scrambled eggs and omelets. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIALTY PRODUCE: 
</P>
<P>
Before the days of hydroponic gardening and international fruit imports, the 
seasons dictated what was put on the table. This seasonality still rules 
Al-Tayebat's produce department. Items come and go according to their growing 
time. Off-season, just as in the Middle East, you'll find some fruits and 
vegetables dried. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh dates: If you've eaten only dried dates, the subtle perfume-like flavor 
of the fresh ones will surprise you. Fresh dates come to market in September 
for only about 10 days, and Al-Tayebat sells them in bunches just as they come 
from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Green almonds: These are picked while the outer shell is still green and before 
the nut has ripened. The immature almond is a faintly flavored jelly. Green 
almonds are available in June. 
</P>
<P>
Young fava beans: The mature and dry fava beans so often called for in Middle 
Eastern recipes need to be shelled and then have the skin of each bean removed. 
But in the fall, when young favas are in season, cooks rejoice for they can 
serve the tender beans unpeeled either raw as mezzeh (appetizers), or lightly 
cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Molukhia: This exotic green leafy vegetable gives its name to an Egyptian soup. 
"Similar to spinach," is how some describe molukhia, but its properties are 
quite different. The leaves release a viscous liquid as they cook, rather like 
okra, which thickens soups and stews. Fresh molukhia is only available in the 
summer, but it is always dried for winter cooking. In Egypt the molukhia soup, 
which some families eat every day, is served sprinkled with ta'leya, a paste of 
crushed garlic and coriander fried in clarified butter. The soup is always 
consumed with lots of rice on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Quinces: Golden in color and shaped like lumpy, slightly elongated apples, 
quinces are a mainstay in Middle Eastern confectionary and a popular ingredient 
in Iranian meat stews. Because they yield abundant pectin, the fruit can easily 
be cooked up into the conserves, fruit leather and the jellied confections so 
popular there. The fruit isn't sweet enough to eat raw, but when cooked slowly, 
as in a Moroccan tajine, it develops a delectable fruity taste. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh sour cherries: Also known as alubalu, these are another fruit often 
cooked with meat. Until recently, they've only been available dried or as a 
preserve, but now Al-Tayebat carries this particular type of cherry fresh 
during the summer. Iranians stew them with lamb and lentils or use them in 
their famous alubalu polo, a cherry-studded rice dish cooked with chicken. The 
cherries make a superlative jam that is served with thick cream for dessert. It 
also makes a delicious drink mixed with ice water; you eat the cherries from 
the bottom of the glass when you've finished drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Unripe grapes: The sour liquid pressed from unripe grapes is available all 
year long in bottled form, but for a few weeks in the late summer, the unripe 
grapes themselves are available at Al-Tayebat. The taste of their juice is much 
sharper and more astringent than lemon or lime juice. It adds sparkle to rich 
meat and cooked fruit dishes such as an Iranian khoresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Karg: In her book "The Cuisine of Armenia," Sonia Uvezian observes, "the 
Armenian enthusiasm for stuffing foods reaches its zenith with vegetables and 
fruits that can be hollowed out." The long, narrow karg, also known as opo or 
English butter gourd, is a perfect vehicle for those famous Armenian stuffings. 
These are elegantly seasoned mixtures of ground meats with rice or bulgur and 
sometimes nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional cooks simmer the stuffed vegetables in broth with lemon juice and a 
little olive oil, but you can also microwave them in a lightly covered glass 
dish. The broth, when poured into the cooking implement should reach about 
three-quarters of the way up the side of the squash. 
</P>
<P>
Butter gourd is also delicious simply steamed and buttered or mixed into stewed 
dishes or soups. 
</P>
<P>
Kusa: Another squash good for stuffing or just eating plain. It resembles a 
pudgy green and white pin-striped zucchini with wavy stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern cucumbers: These are so good that they are often eaten like 
fruit. They inevitably turn up in the ever-present bowl of salad vegetables 
that is placed unadorned on the Middle Eastern mealtime table; everyone simply 
slices off pieces to munch. 
</P>
<P>
When you taste the pale green moqti (the cucumber with raised lengthwise ridges 
also known as Armenian cucumber or ghoota), you'll understand the appeal of 
this custom. Moqti is one of the most delicate and fruit-like cucumbers I have 
ever tasted. Another delicious cucumber sold at Al-Tayebat is the midget, dark 
green khiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh herbs: Al-Tayebat has wonderful bushy bunches of fresh tarragon, various 
mints, dill, tarragon, cilantro, chives and the garlic greens known as garlic 
chives. 
</P>
<P>
STAPLES: 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern olives: The importance of olives in the Middle East is summed up 
with the Lebanese saying, "Wheat and oil are pillars of the house and olives 
are the sultan of the table." The Syrians, who grow an astounding variety of 
olives, cure them at all stages of ripeness to produce an even larger variety. 
Unfortunately, most are only sold domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Tayebat, however, carries Aleppo and Kura olives, two seldom-seen varieties 
from the region. The black, dry-cured Aleppos seem mostly pit but their intense 
flavor is habit-forming. They resemble somewhat the wrinkly dry-cured Moroccan 
olives which the store also carries. A popular way to serve Aleppos, Khouraki 
says, is to marinate them in lemon juice with a little olive oil, a hint of 
Middle Eastern cumin and Aleppo pepper. The Aleppo olives are in the dairy 
cooler case sealed in plastic, not with the other olives in the butcher's case. 
</P>
<P>
The green, cracked Kura olives look almost identical to Greek nafplion olives, 
but have a crisp, slightly bitter taste, different from the tart lemony flavor 
of the Greek olives. Al-Tayebat also carries Greek kalamata olives. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that when a dish calls for cooking with olives, it's best to add them 
at the end of the cooking time so they will just warm through. 
</P>
<P>
Pickles: Even in the modern Middle East, torshi (all kinds of pickles) are made 
and sold in old-fashioned specialty shops. These places are full of color and 
you can always smell the aroma of curing turnips, eggplants and other 
vegetables amid the lively banter of bargaining in process. At Al-Tayebat there 
is a long, well-stocked pickle shelf. There are the ridged moqti cucumbers, hot 
red pickled peppers, leeks, whole baby eggplants and even Italian giardinera. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomegranate molasses: This unsweetened concentrate of pomegranate juice is 
used when a dish needs the flavor of the fruit, but not too much liquid. 
Muhammara, a spicy dip for mezzeh, is an example. Many recipes call for 
pomegranate juice instead, however, which is also available bottled. 
</P>
<P>
Jibna Khadra: The name of this fresh, bland cheese literally means green (that 
is, uncured) cheese. It isn't an eating cheese but rather a basic ingredient in 
dessert pastry fillings and savory pies. Jibna khadra can also be made into 
string cheese by heating and kneading it -- the longer the kneading, the 
stringier the cheese. For Aleppo-style cheese it is kneaded with black caraway 
seeds and mahleb, the fragrant kernels of cherry pits, and then formed into 
patties and stored in brine. Al-Tayebet also sells Aleppo-style cheese ready 
made. You'll find it in jars in the cooler case. 
</P>
<P>
Licorice ramzy: This dried licorice plant is made into a popular iced tea-like 
drink. You simply let it steep, strain it and chill the infusion. 
</P>
<P>
Baba ghannouj: Anyone who has ever prepared this creamy puree of roasted 
eggplant pulp knows what a tedious chore roasting and peeling the charred 
eggplants can be. At Al-Tayebat I came across a brand of canned baba ghannouj 
imported from Lebanon. Al-Wadi baba ghannouj has a nice smoky flavor that many 
commercially prepared brands lack. When you add fresh garlic and olive oil to 
this puree, as the label suggests, your baba ghannouj will taste almost 
homemade. 
</P>
<P>
Sumac: This staple in all Middle Eastern cooking is made from dried, crushed 
sumac berries. You often see in shakers on the tables in Middle Eastern 
restaurants, where it is used to add a tart flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern cumin: Basically the same variety that we see in supermarkets, 
this has a stronger flavor. It comes ground and packaged in plastic bags in 
Al-Tayebat's spice section. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hummus and baba ghannouj, this spicy mixture is designed to be eaten with 
plenty of pita bread and many other small appetizers of the mezzeh table. 
</P>
<P>
 For hot red pepper paste Khouraki uses Indo-European brand, for sweet red 
pepper paste use Adriatic brand.

15-YEAR MORTGAGE NOT A GOOD IDEA

QUESTION: I bought my first home in November, 1988, and received an FHA 8.75%, 
30-year loan. This is a small condominium unit. I am 45 years old, and will 
need to work at least 15 more years in order to be eligible for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if I should consider getting a 15-year mortgage, as I do not want to 
be burdened with a mortgage in addition to condominium fees. I would appreciate 
your advice on the advantages and disadvantages of the 15-year versus the 
30-year mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You have asked two very important questions. One deals with the 30-year 
versus 15-year mortgage, but the second goes to the question of when and 
whether to refinance. 
</P>
<P>
Let's take the refinance question first. In order to switch to either a 15- or 
30-year new loan you will have to refinance. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you want to take a one-year adjustable rate, I seriously doubt that you 
will find a 30-year loan -- or even a 15-year loan -- for the same rate that 
you are currently paying. And do not forget that you will have to pay points 
and other closing costs for your new mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Each point is 1% of the loan amount, and if you were to refinance for $100,000, 
I suspect that you would probably pay somewhere between two and three points -- 
or in other words $2,000 to$3,000 for the privilege of refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, under current market conditions, I do not believe that you should even 
consider refinancing. The general rule of thumb is that until rates come down 
at least two full percentage points below your current mortgage, it does not 
make sense to refinance. 
</P>
<P>
However, you asked about the advantages and disadvantages of a 15-year loan as 
compared to a 30-year loan. 
</P>
<P>
I am biased against the 15-year loan. While there have been many commentators 
who have praised what they perceived to be the benefits of a 15-year mortgage, 
in my opinion, such a mortgage rarely makes sense for the average homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at some examples. You want to compare a $100,000 loan to be 
amortized on a 30-year basis as compared to a 15-year basis. While there are 
lenders who may give you a slightly lower interest rate if you take a 15-year 
loan rather than the 30-year, for comparison purposes, let us assume that both 
loans will cost 10 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
To amortize the loan over 15 years, your monthly payment of principal and 
interest (P&amp;I) is $1,105.40. On a 30-year basis, the P&amp;I is $914.74. 
There is a $190.66 cash savings per month on a 30-year loan. On a yearly basis, 
this is a savings to you of $2,287.92. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the interest deductions for tax purposes will, by and large, 
be the same for the first few years, but as your principal balance goes down 
faster with the 15-year amortization, accordingly your interest payments will 
also be smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the major benefit of the 15-year loan is that you will save a lot of 
interest over the life of your mortgage. On the other hand, you are also 
putting up, in our example, over $2,200 a year toward your principal, thereby 
reducing your mortgage balance and building up your equity. 
</P>
<P>
Equity is the difference between the market value of your house and the 
mortgage or mortgages which you owe. In good real estate market conditions, 
property values increase on a yearly basis as much as 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Even in bad times, we all hope that property values will at least keep up with 
inflation, although, obviously, there will be dips and decreases in market 
values on a periodic basis. 
</P>
<P>
But assuming that we anticipate growth over the next decade, the equity in your 
house will grow regardless of the amount of your mortgage. This equity is "dead 
equity" and in my opinion, you might as well be taking that extra $2,287 and 
burying it in your back yard. In effect, that is my analogy for the 15-year 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
I would rather take the extra $2,000 a year and invest it in a conservative, 
long-term investment for the next 15 years. Even without any computation for 
interest, this will grow to over $34,000 in the next 15 years. That will be the 
start of this important nest egg for the rainy day. 
</P>
<P>
However, the advice I give is obviously general. You are advised to discuss 
your specific needs, plans and tax considerations with your own advisers.

The instructions that come with the various drip or low-flow irrigation kits 
tell you how to install the system -- how many emitters, how much porous piping 
or how many mini-sprinklers are required to water certain plants or a given 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you figure out how long to water with these systems that are so 
unlike sprinklers? Looking at the ground probably won't help because true drip 
systems wet very little surface area though several feet may be soaked 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
You can, of course, simply follow the recommendations that come with the 
particular kit you've installed, and this is a good idea at first. But you are 
working with someone's best estimate and not with figures precise enough to 
save you substantial amounts of water -- and savings of as much as 70% are 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, look in the instruction book that comes with Raindrip systems and 
you'll find a simple little chart that suggests how often and how long to water 
a variety of plants during three kinds of weather -- cool, warm and hot. 
</P>
<P>
During warm weather, it says to turn on the drip system every two days for five 
hours if you are watering shrubs 4 to 5 feet tall. Most kits include this kind 
of general guideline. 
</P>
<P>
Much more precise irrigation is possible because of some recently compiled 
figures called ET ("evapotranspiration") rates. ET tells us how much water a 
standard field of pasture grass loses to the atmosphere in a day. It measures 
both evaporation from the soil and plant surfaces and transpiration from the 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, varies from day to day -- plants obviously losing more in 
summer or during Santa Ana winds, less in winter or on overcast days -- so to 
simplify things we work with averages. 
</P>
<P>
ET rates also vary with location: The farther inland you live, the higher the 
rate -- the greater the water loss -- especially in summer. These figures are 
presented in Table A. 
</P>
<P>
Note that these ET figures represent inches of water lost per day not for the 
whole month. And that they are based on a standard plant -- pasture grass -- so 
we need another table to work from, one that converts that ET figure for 
pasture grass into a figure that works for other kinds of plants. Table B gives 
us these "plant factors." Note that most are fractions of the ET because most 
plants use less water than pasture grass. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with these figures, we are ready to plug them into a formula that looks 
like this (and you thought you would never have any use for that algebra): 
</P>
<P>
THE FORMULA 
</P>
<P>
Gallons of water per plant, per day = ET x Plant factor x Plant area* x .623 
</P>
<P>
divided by 
</P>
<P>
Drip irrigation efficiency factor 
</P>
<P>
"Plant area" is easy to figure. Simply multiply the diameter of the plant by 
itself (d x d), then by .785 (d x d x .785). Get out the tape measure and 
calculator and give it a try. A rose measures 3 feet across, so 3 x 3 x .785 = 
about 7 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
One plant down and 200 to go you think? Well, you should figure out a few fruit 
trees and other large plants, but then you can come up with a few standard 
sizes for everything else, which will simplify things greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Find the ET in Table A and the Plant Factor in Table B. Now do the math. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have done all the multiplication in the formula, you divide the whole 
thing by a "drip efficiency factor." In warm to hot, dry climates, this would 
be .85; in mild dry climates (near the coast), it is .90. 
</P>
<P>
Totally lost? Let's try an example. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in West Los Angeles and want to know how many gallons of water a 
rose needs every day in July, here's the math: .17 (the ET) x 1 (the plant 
factor -- roses are thirsty plants) x 7 (the plant area) x .623 = .75. Now, 
divide that by .90 and you get about .8 gallons per day. How about that? You 
now know exactly how much water that rose needs on any given day during July. 
</P>
<P>
If one emitter is taking care of this rose, and it is rated as delivering 1 
gallon of water every hour (1 gph), it would have to be on for about 48 minutes 
each day to provide the water lost during that warm July day. 
</P>
<P>
To figure this out, divide the gallons required by the plant, by the flow rate 
of the emitters (.8 gallons divided by 1 gallon per hour = .8 hours), then 
multiply that by 60 to get minutes (.8 x 60 = 48 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
The formula here is: 
</P>
<P>
Total gallons required divided by total flow of emitters = hours of irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
You can water every day, but more likely you will be watering every few days so 
you will have to multiply this daily amount by the interval between 
irrigations. If you water the rose every three days, the water must be on for 
about 2 hours and 24 minutes (3 days x 48 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
How often should you irrigate? Here are some guidelines on how often to turn on 
a drip system: For small shrubs and flowers, every 2 to 3 days; for large 
shrubs and small trees, every 3 to 4 days, and for medium to large trees, every 
5 to 6 days. You can irrigate less often, but these suggested intervals 
maintain a fairly constant supply of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours and 15 minutes is a long time, and that points up the big difference 
between sprinklers and drip systems. Sprinklers put a lot of water on real 
fast. Some of this water puddles and soaks in unevenly, or runs off. Drip 
systems put water on slowly but it all soaks in, right where it's needed. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to automate, you should note that special timers are required for 
drip systems because many timers will not keep valves open for two hours. 
Special timers suitable for drip irrigation systems are coming onto the market. 
</P>
<P>
While it is easiest to figure out how long to water with individual drip 
emitters, you can use the formula and tables to calculate how long to water 
with other systems. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if you are using mini-sprinklers to water a 5-by-16 foot bed of 
flowers that includes roses, figure out how much water the entire bed needs 
based on the needs of the biggest water user there (the roses). 
</P>
<P>
Let's do it for the month of November: .08 (November ET) x 80 square feet (area 
of flower bed) x 1 (plant factor for roses) x .623 = 3.98. Divide by .90 
(efficiency factor) and you get 4.4 gallons used by the entire bed each day. 
</P>
<P>
Now figure out how much water the mini-sprinklers are delivering to the entire 
bed. The particular brand we are using requires four mini-sprinklers that 
deliver 6 gallons an hour and two that deliver 12 gph, so all together they 
deliver 48 gallons an hour (4 x 6 gph + 2 x 12 gph) -- this you learn from the 
kit instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's figure how long to leave the mini-sprinklers on: total gallons 
required by the whole bed divided by the flow rate of the entire system (4.4 
divided by 48 = .09 hours) and convert that to minutes (.09 x 60 = 5.4 
minutes). If we water every three days we must let the system run for about 16 
minutes (3 x 5.4 minutes = 16.2 minutes). We've done it again! 
</P>
<P>
You can figure out other kinds of systems in the same fashion. 
</P>
<P>
If you are building your own system from scratch this information can be found 
in the "Landscape Drip Irrigation Design Manual" booklet D-38829, available 
from Rain Bird Sales, Attention: Laura, 145 N. Grand Ave., Glendora, Calif., 
91704. The cost is $5.) 
</P>
<P>
It may take a little while for all this to soak in, if you will pardon the pun, 
but you can learn how to irrigate very accurately. 
</P>
<P>
Begin with the instructions that come with a kit and then try being more 
precise as you become acquainted with how it all works.

Wrong math -- At the bottom of the chart on "How Long To Water" on Page K13 in 
the Nov. 18 Real Estate section, the formula should have read, "Total gallons 
required divided by total flow of emitters equals hours of irrigation." This 
formula was correctly stated in the story, but not in the chart.

REMODELER'S DIARY: PAINT, SHELVING AND IMAGINATION TRANSFORM RENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA JOHNSON, Johnson is a waitress and would-be writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is hardly a saga to compete with tales of walls torn down, kitchens gutted 
or cottages turned into castles. When you're renting, there are limits to the 
changes you can make. 
</P>
<P>
But we had lived here for almost 10 years; I couldn't see us moving soon and I 
was tired of the same old walls. So I painted them, tore out the old bookcases 
and rearranged the book shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Simple enough, you say, but now my home has a warm peach glow and looks open 
and airy throughout; small changes, but what a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The project started with a pair of dark bookcases made long ago for another 
house. The bookcases were fine when we first moved in, but 10 years later they 
looked old and they crowded an already small living room. 
</P>
<P>
My heart cried out for the illusion of space, so one night I pulled the first 
bookcase down. I still hadn't admitted to myself how much work I was going to 
do. I just knew that the bookcases had to go. 
</P>
<P>
Dismantling the bookcases gave me the lumber for the bedroom shelves, recut and 
routered and painted dove gray. These replaced the cherry-stained pine shelves, 
which I recut and put up on brackets in the living room. But fresh new shelves 
can't be put up on drab walls, so off I went to the paint store. 
</P>
<P>
Premixed paint colors were pale and neuter; I wanted a warm, vibrant peach. I 
figured three gallons would do two bedrooms, the living room and hall. 
</P>
<P>
With the first brush strokes on the bedroom wall I wondered whether my peach 
was perhaps a touch bold. Throwing caution to the winds, I completed the room, 
hung the dove-gray shelves, then painted the doors and windows the same gray 
with darker accents. The color of the walls receded to a livable degree. 
</P>
<P>
I thought the bright peach might be too sharp for the living room, so I 
splashed some swatches on the walls in sunlight and shadow areas and meditated 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
By the time my next day off came it was clear that I wanted a softer peach in 
the living room. I bought a gallon of cream paint and mixed a large dollop into 
the remaining two gallons of peach. My living room and hall were transformed -- 
softer but still vibrant with color and deliciously fresh. 
</P>
<P>
With only half a gallon of peach paint left to cover four walls, the ceiling 
and closet of my daughter's former room, my paint was running low, so I 
lightened the peach again and ended up with about a gallon of "peaches 'n 
cream." I ran out before I could finish the closet, so I finished that off with 
the last of the cream. 
</P>
<P>
Once the bookcases were torn down I needed a cabinet to fit below the window 
and between the new book shelves to hold the television and VCR as well as a 
multitude of tapes. After many unsuccessful shopping trips to furniture stores, 
I decided upon a simple design I could make myself. 
</P>
<P>
My biggest financial outlay was the price of the 18-inch-wide boards that make 
up the frame of the cabinet and the three tape storage units that are 
incorporated into it. To facilitate electronic hook-ups and make it easier to 
move, I added heavy-duty casters. Few decisions I made were as good as that 
one. 
</P>
<P>
With the walls freshly painted and bookcases bracketing the window and TV/VCR 
cabinet, the living room slipped together like a comfortable new shoe. 
</P>
<P>
I used light- and dark-gray for the window frames and doors, and although it 
was a thoroughly nasty job, I don't regret stripping the metal windows and 
doing a from-the- bottom-up refinishing job. Not only are the windows sharp and 
clean, free of rust and mold, but these 35-year-old windows close completely 
for the first time as if they were new. 
</P>
<P>
I think my biggest mistake was in not admitting to myself that I was actually 
going to do the whole lot. Except for the initial plunge for the peach paint I 
bought a little here and there, ending up with repeated and unnecessary trips 
to various stores. Hindsight is great,but I think I could have planned that 
better. 
</P>
<P>
A few helpful hints: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The extension arm for the paint roller keeps you off ladders and makes it 
easier to move about the room. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put all of the furniture into the middle and cover it with drop cloths. 
Paint from a roller spatters in tiny little dots. Careful preparation means a 
lot less cleanup later. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I used thin plastic gloves when I painted. Strip them off and your hands 
are perfectly clean. A little baby powder shaken inside makes them reusable and 
easier to put on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you have to leave your painting for a few hours, put your paint roller 
into a plastic bag and twist-tie it around the handle. This will keep the paint 
from drying and you can pick up where you left off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The water-base paints available are wonderfully fast to clean up with water 
when still wet or a swab of alcohol if dried. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you plan to do it yourself, give yourself plenty of time. Goals are 
fine, but you want a finished job that you can take pride in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make lists for your project to show the order your job will follow, then 
one for little things you don't want to forget, such as touch-ups you notice 
while doing somethingelse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And don't forget to follow your instincts. Although I made changes, 
sometimes taking a few days to decide, all of my decisions proved right in the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
I did my redecoration while working five days a week, along with the usual 
housework. It took longer than it would have with help or an infusion of money, 
but it was a kick to watch as a dozen small projects began to come together. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the job is finished I'm proud of the way my duplex looks, but seeing 
the metamorphosis as the days rolled by was as much fun. Not to be discounted 
is the feeling of pride and satisfaction that comes from doing it myself, 
proving I could, and loving the result.

DENTISTS VOLUNTEER AT COSTA MESA CLINIC TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT PAY FOR 
TREATMENT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been more than five years since Debbie Victor sat in a dentist's chair, 
but she wasn't as nervous as she expected to be. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Anaheim woman fidgeted a bit but joked with Steven Wu as he 
fitted her for a new set of dentures. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure hope they fit because the last pair of dentures I had were a 
nightmare," Victor said. "They didn't fit and I couldn't even talk. I had to 
stop wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
For Victor, who spent much of last year homeless, the new dentures were not 
just a matter of vanity. If she didn't get some teeth soon, she said, she would 
lose her job as a waitress at a coffee shop in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"They have already taken me off of the weekend shift because they say that's 
when a lot of families come in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So Victor turned to the Share Our Selves Dental Clinic in Costa Mesa, a last 
resort for those who desperately need dental care but have no money to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The two-room clinic is part of the Rea Community Center at 661 Hamilton St. 
Despite its worn-out brown carpeting, peeling paint and cramped quarters, the 
clinic is still a welcome sight for its patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't help everyone, but we try to get people out of a lot of pain," said 
Wu, one of 22 dentists with private practices elsewhere who donate time each 
month to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, staffed by volunteers, opened in 1987 and treats an average of 180 
people each month. It costs about $40,000 a year to run the clinic, which is 
funded entirely by donations. 
</P>
<P>
Potential patients are screened first and must have no other options for dental 
care, said Elizabeth Curran, clinic director. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, the amount of patients we have exceeds the number of volunteers, so 
we can't accept as many cases as we would like," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic offers free services including fillings, root canals, extractions, 
teeth cleanings and denture repairs, for free. The clinic also provides a 
limited amount of lab service. 
</P>
<P>
Wu, who describes himself as a "typical yuppie," said volunteering at the 
clinic has helped him to keep his priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in that yuppie group, but you have to stop and think about how that's not 
all there is to life. Your biggest concern should not be about your new Beemer 
(BMW)," said Wu, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Wu said he tries to establish the same kind of relationship with his patients 
at the clinic as he has with patients at his own practice. He has requested 
that he be able to see the same patients whenever possible to provide some 
continuity of care. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel a great deal of satisfaction because you feel like you are really 
appreciated," Wu said. "At your own practice, people have higher expectations 
because they are paying you. Here, you are serving a basic need and people are 
very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
One of those grateful patients was Manzar Assadi, 33, who came to the clinic 
with the pain of a toothache she had endured for more than five months because 
the cost of treatment was prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, her tooth had deteriorated until she needed a root canal. Her three 
visits to the clinic, which included the root canal, would have cost her about 
$1,200 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
After being treated by Wu, Assadi walked into the clinic's waiting room and 
broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a relief," she said, as she dabbed her eyes with a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just so grateful because I had been in such pain. They helped me to relax 
and treated me very good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Luthi, 23, of Costa Mesa developed a toothache in her upper molars 
recently and panicked because she was without a job and health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering for three weeks, she contacted the Orange County Health 
Department and was referred to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm here to have my entire mouth filled," Luthi said. "I'll be here 
quite a few more times. I really don't mind, but the worst part is sitting in 
that chair waiting for that drill to come." 
</P>
<P>
Soloman Moses, 38, arrived in Orange County more than a month ago after 
spending most of his life in Hawaii. He was jobless, homeless and in need of a 
root canal. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine told me about this place," Moses said as he waited to see the 
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"Dental work is pretty expensive these days, so a place like this is really 
great. Everyone here is really friendly and treats you like a paying customer," 
Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
Patient Blanca Bueno, a 39-year-old Mexican immigrant with four children, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They have compassion for people here. I was going to have to have my tooth 
pulled out because I had a lot of problems with cavities," Bueno said. "I feel 
very confident here that I will be taken care of. The people are volunteers -- 
and they care." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic also accepts a limited number of patients who need dentures or 
"flippers," which are partial dentures that give the impression of teeth. Both 
the dentures and partial dentures are made by Curran's students at Riverside 
Community College's dental technology department. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very selective about who we do dentures for because they are so 
expensive," Curran said. "Cosmetic work is important because Californians are 
so teeth conscious. It's a matter of self-esteem and employability." 
</P>
<P>
Victor was chosen as one of two denture cases the clinic accepts each month 
because her job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really appreciate what they're doing for me," Victor said. "Once I get on my 
feet, I want to send them some money. That way I can help someone else out. 
What goes around, comes around."

As night falls on this city of 11 million, the electronic billboards flicker 
into life, illuminating Day-Glo flying saucers and cups that scroll across 
giant screens, advertising a host of Japanese products. It is rush hour, and 
the subway disgorges waves of businessmen headed for bouts of ritual-like 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
But the youths milling in front of the Cay Club seem oblivious to their 
Blade-Runner-like surroundings. Wearing happi coats, ponytails and leather 
sandals, they are too intent on getting through the club doors to see Shang 
Shang Typhoon, a band that is igniting a modest cultural revolution here by 
mixing a campy, self-consciously Asian singing style with updated folk songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Today in Japan we have many rock and roll, punk, heavy metal and reggae bands, 
but this is original Japanese music with a message," says 32-year-old Yoshida 
Tabo, voicing an enthusiasm shared by many in the crowd. "I feel their Japanese 
spirit. We've been waiting for this music for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
After two generations of copying the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Rotten 
and Guns N' Roses, young Japanese are for the first time delving into their own 
cultural roots for popular musical inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
The last year has seen the emergence of a handful of bands that temper rock 'n' 
roll with traditional Japanese melodies and instruments such as the 
three-string, banjo-like shamisen and the shakuhachi bamboo flute. Some also 
resurrect the high-pitched Minyo singing style and Enka, the twangy Japanese 
country ballads from Okinawa. The result is a music that is as rootsy to the 
Japanese as Little Feat and the Grateful Dead are to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are also putting their own stamp on rap music, that uniquely 
American phenomenon of the inner city, using it to explore issues relevant to 
their island nation. In Tokyo, such musicians as Tycoon Tosh and MC Kan are 
redefining rap, singing in mixed English and Japanese while sampling Japanese 
pop songs, Japanese TV jingles and Japanese movie sound tracks. 
</P>
<P>
This rap movement, which Japanese record companies say is growing steadily, is 
spearheaded by Major Force, an independent hip-hop label started by five 
musicians, including a former Kodo drummer and an ex-punk rocker. 
</P>
<P>
In roots music, the resurgence is led by bands like Tama, Shang Shang Typhoon, 
the Bo-Gumbos, Okinawan favorite Shoukichi Kina and Champluse, the Rinken Band 
and Qujila. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the sounds of the Japanese language," reflects 33-year-old Yasuo 
Sugibayashi, the lead singer and co-founder of Qujila (a play on the Japanese 
word for whale), a band that alternates between a swirling, romantic lyricism 
and a syncopated beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Many bands sing in Japanese-English," he said, referring to a trend in which 
English words are pronounced with Japanese flourishes, "and that doesn't sound 
good for me, I want to sing in real Japanese. Maybe the lines of nations will 
disappear someday, but language is eternal. I want to preserve our language." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese record executives, who still place the bulk of their promotional yen 
behind Japanese power pop and Western-imitation rock bands, have been caught 
off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Shang Shang Typhoon is taking off so quickly that even their management isn't 
sure how to market them," says Bobbie Sato, a marketing coordinator at 
Epic/Sony Records. The band, whose two female vocalists wear gauzy veils, 
balloon pants and lots of bracelets, dance delicately with fans and bow deeply 
to the crowd after each song. Their music blends strains of Okinawan, Chinese 
classical, Thai dance and Japanese pop music, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
An album released in late July, which includes several tracks mixed in Paris by 
world music producer Martin Messonier, has already sold 50,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
While that is a pittance compared to Japanese "idol" stars whose spun-sugar 
cute looks and bubble-gum pop records sell millions of copies, Shang Shang 
Typhoon's new traditionalism mirrors the change in sensibilities among small 
but influential groups of Japanese young people who are rejecting the West and 
turning East in their search for cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Western culture has been very strong until now, but it is fading away and we 
feel a new energy coming from the East," says Reiko Yukawa, a Japanese rock 
journalist and music promoter in Tokyo. "There is a very strong energy from 
Asia in these groups. We're not sure what it is but we're like a centipede, 
inching toward it."

</P>
<P>
It's Hip Hop night at Gold, a cavernous, three-story club that is the hottest 
club in Tokyo this fall, and Major Force mix-master MC Kan is moving smoothly 
from the Jungle Brothers to MC Hammer to Intelligent Hoodlum. When he lays on 
"The Power" by Snap, the floor goes wild. 
</P>
<P>
Hip Japanese kids have hopped all over hip-hop culture, which they learn about 
from music videos and films like "Wild Style" and "Colors." At Yoyogi Park each 
Sunday, the enlightened set up shop with a generator, stereo equipment and 
their U.S. import records, dancing and scratching to the same sounds you'd hear 
at any L.A. club. And soon it won't be make-believe: The Los Angeles-based 
hip-hop club United Nations is expected to open a branch in Tokyo this fall. 
</P>
<P>
At Yoyogi Park and Japanese clubs, it's not unusual to see Afrika medallions, 
L.A. Raiders caps worn backward, bold striped shirts, overalls with one strap 
hanging off the shoulder, dreadlocks and hair carving. For good measure, a 
hip-hopper flashes a gang sign at a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
But rap and its concerns seem utterly divorced from its original context in 
homogenous, high-tech and low-crime Tokyo. What do the Japanese know about the 
bleak reality of America's ghettoes? Or families that sleep in their bathtubs 
to avoid stray bullets from feuding gangs? What do they think about the racist 
comment made recently by their justice minister, who likened prostitutes to 
blacks, saying that both groups ruin a neighborhood when they move in? 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. says Public Enemy is big so it became big here in Japan," says Isaac 
Sakanishi, who produces a music video show for Japanese TV. "But if you ask 
Japanese if they understand the lyrics, they don't. The things that Public 
Enemy is singing about are so outside their experience." 
</P>
<P>
More progressive labels like Major Force are moving beyond American rap to 
forge a uniquely Japanese style. And Major Force rappers are beginning to rap 
about Japanese issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan as No. 1 GNP is getting higher," sings Tycoon Tosh. "Really means 
nothing just rich and poor/ Drink sake after 5 throwing up everywhere / Kam 
</P>
<P>
pai ("here's to") the Big Business." 
</P>
<P>
While these lyrics may never dislodge MC Hammer from the top of the rap charts, 
it does show that the Japanese are trying to establish their own identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, we were just copying you. Now we're becoming very original," 
says Tosh, whose Major Force logo bears the motto "Strong Force From the 
Orient. May the Force Be With You." 
</P>
<P>
Tosh is a one-man music phenomenon. In 1977, he founded the Plastics, one of 
Japan's only punk bands ever to find fame abroad. In the late '70s and early 
'80s, the quirky Plastics, who he says "mixed punk with Kraftwerk," toured 
England and the United States with the Talking Heads and the B-52s. In the mid- 
and late '80s, Tosh explored world music, house and dance mixes at his own 
Tokyo club, Pithecanthropus erectus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Major Force posse includes MC Kan and his crew Tiny Panx ("Punk 
Inc."), a female rap duo called the Orchids, Tycoon Tosh and his Terminator 
Troops, ragamuffin artist Chappie (who played Harlem's Apollo Theater in New 
York last year) and Sexy TKO, billed as "after hours homeboys homegirls 
lovemaking sexy music." For the last two years, the posse has headed to the New 
Music Seminar in New York to debut its newest sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo sound machine has its work cut out for it at home. Tosh says it's 
hard to rap in Japanese -- there aren't many rhyming words. And while Major 
Force artists have achieved a small cult following among some London DJs, Tosh 
says most Japanese kids today still prefer American rap to Tokyo home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, predicts one cynical Major Force aficionado, Japanese kids who 
follow London and U.S. alternative music scenes almost fanatically will hear 
about Major Force artists from the West. At that point, Japanese-generated 
hip-hop will find a larger audience at home. 
</P>
<P>
For now though, the Major Force label is saying it loud: I'm Japanese and I'm 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
"We gotta have a label that can out-put our contribution toward the new music 
movements," Tosh says, "and not simply consume Western in-put." 
</P>

"Japanese are treated by their school system and their superiors in the way a 
landscape gardener treats a hedge; protruding bits of the personality are 
regularly snipped off." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Karel van Wolferen in 
</P>
<P>
"The Enigma of Japanese Power" 
</P>
<P>
Despite its outward social harmony, Japan can be an oppressive and alienating 
place for those who don't fit in. Deep undercurrents of anger and frustration 
pulse below the surface and explode occasionally. Last month, for instance, 
disenfranchised youths and day laborers in a seedy district of Osaka staged 
several days of rioting that led to burning, looting, 55 arrests and 186 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Those who follow youth culture say a backlash is growing against the conformist 
Japanese culture and its 15-hour workdays. While it's unclear how large their 
ranks are, young people are beginning to drop out of their over-programmed 
society, working odd jobs for spare cash, tripling up in tiny apartments and 
spending their free time making music and hanging out. The Japanese call them 
"freeters." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have many, many freeters over 25 and 30 years of age," says Yukawa, who 
has chronicled the music scene in Japan for more than 30 years. "They don't 
want to work hard and join a good company." 
</P>
<P>
While many freeters will probably live out their fantasies for a few years, 
then swap their tinted locks and rebel gear for short hair and a business suit, 
new ones take their place. The freeter phenomenon fuels the estimated 10,000 
bands that play at hundreds of "Live Houses" throughout Tokyo each night. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pervasive sense, when talking to young, self-aware Japanese today, 
that they are held in check by society as surely as young Eastern Europeans and 
Soviets until recently were denied self-expression by their governments. While 
the punk movement certainly isn't new to Japan, the wistful search for identity 
has introduced a new dimension, one that roots bands such as Shang Shang 
Typhoon may be able to tap into: Despite their embrace of Western trends and 
musical styles, freeters seem to be searching for something that Western music 
can't provide. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese young people today have too much cultural information, too much 
money," says Sakanishi, who hires freeters as extras for his music videos. "We 
have nothing happening here. We're too satisfied. And satisfaction makes people 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Many creative people believe the antidote lies in rediscovering their Japanese 
heritage. "We've got to keep looking for our roots," Tycoon Tosh says. "I think 
young bands should be more like Shang Shang Typhoon or Tama. It's better than 
copying the Rolling Stones." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned Japanese say it's time for Japan to pay better attention to world 
issues. And one topic that resonates loudly in this nation that reveres homes 
and items made of wood is the destruction of the Amazon rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
In the song "Greenhouse Effect," Tycoon Tosh examines his culpability as a 
Japanese consumer: 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the noodle shop 
</P>
<P>
 I use disposable chopsticks, stick, tick 
</P>
<P>
 Wondering where it came from 
</P>
<P>
 You know, it came from New Guinea, it came from the Amazon 
</P>
<P>
 Oh no, red zone, the rain forest is dying, crying, cuz somebody's buying 
</P>
<P>
 Economic animal in the rain forest." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is looking east for its inspiration, to Asia. Japan is tired of copying 
the West. One hears that over and over again today when talking to artists, 
designers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to remind people that there is a traditional culture," says Shang 
Shang Typhoon guitarist Kohryu, which means "Red Dragon." "We're trying to 
raise Japanese consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Or consider Elephant Kashimashi, whose 22-year-old lead singer wails in an 
anguished, post-punk style. Kashimashi writes in a style of poetic, old 
Japanese that dates back 400 years and isn't even spoken any longer: 
</P>
<P>
 The wind of this world is so heavy 
</P>
<P>
 But I go on fighting 
</P>
<P>
 The lonely wind of this ephemeral world 
</P>
<P>
 Begins telling on me 
</P>
<P>
 It begins penetrating my skin 
</P>
<P>
 And it's hard for me to look so composed 
</P>
<P>
 But we should be free men. Right? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
With Japan's militaristic history, the resurgence of strong cultural awareness 
brings up specters of nationalism. When asked about this however, most of the 
rap and roots artists working today say their goal is just the opposite: They 
want internationalism and a reckoning with Japan's role in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In education here, we never teach the kids what we did to other Asian people 
during the war, and that's a big problem," says Motoharu Sano, a 33-year-old 
rock star with a social conscience whose records sell 300,000 copies each. "If 
you pretend not to notice what is happening in the world, there will be new 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Sano, who has written a song for a record he hopes to make with Sean and Yoko 
Ono next year called "Asian Flowers," alludes to his conflicting feelings about 
Japan's aggressive military actions during World War II in a song called 
"Shame": 
</P>
<P>
 "Coercion 
</P>
<P>
 Plunder 
</P>
<P>
 Ouster 
</P>
<P>
 Malice 
</P>
<P>
 Domination 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame 
</P>
<P>
 It is wrong 
</P>
<P>
 Or it's not wrong 
</P>
<P>
 Don't wanna hurt anybody 
</P>
<P>
 Don't wanna be hurt by anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year musical evolution of the band Qujila also mirrors this 
soul-searching. A decade ago, the band played Western-style rock. Then they 
moved to acoustic and Japanese folk music. Later they got into funk and reggae. 
Now their music is a pastiche of them all. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been suffering a lack of identity in our music so we started playing 
old Japanese-style folk songs and pre-World War II Japanese popular songs," 
says Qujila bassist Kioto Tanahashi, 33. "It was exotic for us. We called it 
'rehabilly' music." 
</P>
<P>
Qujila guitarist and lead singer Sugibayashi says their inspiration came from 
childhood lullabies and Japanese mythology. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see spirits in our city," he says. "I want to use TV and video to 
create a new folklore. Old but new spirits live in our cities and our TVs and 
of course in our music." 
</P>
<P>
Sugibayashi sits, with almost preternatural calm, sipping green tea in a 
recording studio. He wears a purple and black striped shirt, baggy red pants 
that tie at the ankles and shamrock green topsiders. Shyly, he smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were younger, we wanted to be like Americans and we fought against our 
spiritual heritage," Sugibayashi says. "At that time, it was a big deal to take 
a trip to a foreign country. Now it's very easy to take a trip abroad but it's 
much more difficult to take a spiritual trip, a trip inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been given many presents from Western culture," he says quietly. "Now 
it's our turn to give something back."

BUT FOR MOST FANS, WESTERN POP RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about the Rolling Stones and Madonna -- The best-selling Western music 
today in Japan is something the Japanese call buraku-con. 
</P>
<P>
What, you might ask, is buraku-con? 
</P>
<P>
"It's black contemporary music, and it's extremely popular in Japan," says Matt 
Kaufman, a Billboard Magazine spokesman who follows Japanese music trends. 
</P>
<P>
Buraku-con includes artists such as Bobby Brown, Janet Jackson and Bell Biv 
Devoe. Earlier this month on J-Wave, a popular Tokyo music station, Prince's 
"Thieves in the Temple" was the No. 1 single; "Praying for Time" by George 
Michael stood at No. 2. "Manatsu No Kajitsu" by the Southern All Stars, a 
Japanese band that blends elements of Billy Joel and the Beatles, was No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the second-largest music market in the world after the United States, 
generating music sales of $3.9 billion last year, according to the Japan 
Phonograph Record Assn. Kaufman says it is also the glittering land of Oz to 
many Western performers, including Madonna, who launch tours there and rake 
money to finance the rest of their trips. 
</P>
<P>
British as well as American stars capitalize on their popularity by releasing 
special records in Japan or adding extra tracks that aren't available in the 
West. The Japanese version of Duran Duran's newest album includes three songs 
not available on the U.S. version, Kaufman says. 
</P>
<P>
But while the fascination with all things Western continues, the Japanese are 
turning more and more to their own artists. In the 1960s, 50% of all music 
sales were foreign recordings. Today, that figure has dropped to 25%, as 
Japanese bands mushroom and consumers switch to indigenous rock by bands like 
the Blue Hearts and female vocalists like Yumi (Yumming) Matsutoya and Seiko 
Matsuda. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, pop-rock artist Senri Oe's new album "Apollo" is No. 1 on the 
Japanese charts. Don't be deceived by the Elvis Costello-like pose on the 
cover; there's nothing wry, manic or angry about this music. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the "idols," cute teen-age girls and boys whose images and 
careers are carefully controlled by record companies. Even the record companies 
themselves admit that the "idols" can't sing, but they look photogenic on TV 
and sell millions of records each year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular such bands today is the gimmicky Hikari Genji, whose 
music was described by one Western industry observer as "New Kids on the Block 
meets Menudo, on roller skates." Yes, they really do perform on skates. 
</P>
<P>
All these bands benefit from the increasing affluence of young Japanese, who 
often live at home until marriage because they can't afford the astronomical 
real estate prices. This leaves them lots of disposable income to spend on 
clothes and entertainment. LaToya Jackson concert tickets recently went for $80 
each, and that was the over-the-counter price, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the ability of America to export various members of the Jackson Family and 
other top musical acts to Japan is not reciprocal. 
</P>
<P>
We may drive Toyotas and pop our CDs into Sony decks, but not since the late 
Kyu Sakamoto scored with "Sukiyaki," a campy hit released in 1963, has a 
Japanese pop song been hummed en-masse by American throats. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, New Age-inspired Kitaro, the Yellow Magic Orchestra and Ryuichi Sakamoto 
have found followings in the United States, but those are instrumentalists, not 
mainstream rock artists. 
</P>
<P>
Easy-listening Japanese pop and teen idols simply don't go over well here. Take 
Seiko Matsuda, a best-selling female vocalist in Japan who has released more 
than a dozen No. 1 albums in Japan and sold millions of records. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Sony, which owns CBS Records, put Matsuda in the studio for 
six months with Miami Sound Machine producer Emilio Estefan and fine-tuned her 
looks in anticipation of her U.S. debut, "Seiko." 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan she has this really cutesy image, like a Barbie doll, but the A&amp;R 
people in New York said, 'You've got to lose that image and start wearing 
leather jackets," says Jeff Murray, a Los Angeles-based consultant for 
Epic/Sony Records. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda was then teamed up on a duet with Donnie Wahlberg, one of the New Kids 
on the Block, in a move that Sony hoped would crack open the U.S. market. But 
the single, "The Right Combination," stalled at 74 on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
"They put a lot of money into it and I don't think anyone took it seriously, it 
was a rip-off on Madonna," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan however, the album went to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese rock-punk band, the Blue Hearts, sells out Budokan, one of the 
country's largest stadium, but played to a crowd of 50 people recently at New 
York's China Club. DENISE HAMILTON

<P>
JOHN FLECK'S RADICAL SHTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, Jan Breslauer is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The orange gargoyles on the porch overhang of John Fleck's Echo Park cottage 
smirk as a visitor passes beneath their gaze. 
</P>
<P>
"Come in," booms an unseen voice resonant with operatic timbre, the sound 
emanating from the inner sanctum, through the portal of the heavy wooden door 
set artfully ajar. "I've been expecting you." 
</P>
<P>
Strewn in Garbo-like repose across a couch in a murky corner of the living 
room, the performance artist-actor vamps. A plaster cherub, perched high above 
the gothic candelabra on the fireplace mantle, surveys the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck meets the press dressed in striped bermudas over royal blue long 
underwear. He has, after all, become mildly well known as one of the four 
infamous performance artists denied fellowships earlier this year by the 
National Endowment for the Arts. He has since gotten the hang of the "media 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I hope to exert more confidence than last time we talked," says 
Fleck, seated at his kitchen table, munching almonds because he's "trying to be 
a vegetarian." Outside the kitchen on the back porch, a miniature U.S. flag 
rises out of the pot of an unsuspecting succulent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more experience," he continues candidly. "For awhile there, I felt 
like Liz Taylor, like this media celebrity. I kind of felt, 'Oh, I never have 
to do anything, they just keep writing about me.' They were talking about all 
this old stuff that happened years ago. Lotsa press. Yeow! 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that day when the whole NEA thing happened," Fleck 
continues. "I'd just finished a show at an AIDS hospice. I was burned out. I 
get home and there were 25 messages from this newspaper, that newspaper. I 
hadn't even heard the news. A day later, we were all Federal Expressed our 
rejection letters." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of newspaper articles followed. Vanity Fair did a page on Fleck and his 
fellow forbidden artists -- Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller. "At 
first it was a lot of fun," he recalls. "I was very naive. I just started 
gabbing." Then CNN called in August. Then Oprah. Then the hostility from people 
Fleck had never even met came streaming in. 
</P>
<P>
Now the dust has begun to settle. And while the NEA uproar has caused Fleck a 
lot of grief and certainly hasn't made him famous, there is a bit of a silver 
lining. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a few more out-of-town bookings and mildly heightened interest in his 
mainstream stage and screen career, the Los Angeles Theatre Center has just 
commissioned Fleck and Miller to create new works. They have each received 
$5,000 to make new hourlong performances to be presented as companion pieces at 
LATC in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the commissions, according to LATC artistic director Bill 
Bushnell is to make up for NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer's unwillingness to 
finance Fleck and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fearless and he's outrageous," says Bushnell, who first cast Fleck in a 
production he directed in 1978. "This (experience) is going a long way toward 
politicizing an artist that didn't think of himself as political. He thought of 
himself as a clown. He didn't realize some of the great social critics have 
been clowns." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his stage work, the 39-year-old Fleck has played in low- and 
medium-budget films from "Hard Rock Zombies" to "Howard the Duck" to "Pink 
Cadillac." He's does enough commercials to keep the residuals flowing, and he's 
landed some plum television roles, such as spots on series such as "Cheers" and 
a part in "Sweet Bird of Youth" with Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
On the stage he really shines -- whether it's as a crazed 90-year-old woman in 
Robert Cossa's "The Granny" at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego earlier this 
year, or as the buff stud Matamore in "The Illusion," an adaptation of the 
17th-Century work seen last spring at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
But Fleck's notoriety, and painful lessons, have come from his work as a 
performance artist. Because of the NEA experience, he's suffered the slings and 
arrows of misrepresentation in the press, hate mail, menacing phone calls, and, 
of course, emotional drain. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, it has forced Fleck to rethink why he does what he does. Some 
people seek an activist mindset, others have it thrust upon them. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck's most notorious performance piece -- partly thanks to U.S. Sen. Jesse 
Helms' indignation -- is "Blessed Are All the Little Fishes." It's the same 
work -- as he half-jokingly admits in a self-referential monologue that makes 
up the final segment of the performance -- that he's been doing in one version 
or another for nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Fleck journeys through incarnations as a drunken human, a glamorous if 
forlorn merman in a bathtub, and a crazed evangelist who has to preach in order 
to urinate. 
</P>
<P>
Lavish to the point of rococo, the performance includes a gaggle of 
Vegas-worthy chorus boys and an episode in which Fleck nearly smothers an 
innocent goldfish that is the object of his affection. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of "Fishes" sees Fleck return for what many presume to be the 
curtain call, only to launch into a sardonic monologue about the work just 
seen, his life and sundry other 1990s topics. 
</P>
<P>
Although popular with the critics and a cadre of loyal followers, Fleck isn't 
everybody's cup of java. 
</P>
<P>
"It got tedious when he went into this long monologue about what it meant to be 
gay and his boyfriends," says critic-director Charles Marowitz of "Blessed Are 
All the Little Fishes." "As a series of confessional gallery (vignettes), it 
was unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's part of a gay tradition that has constantly thrown up extravagant 
performers. The problem with it is, it tends to be circumscribed within gay 
experience. In that show, when it was the show proper, it worked on an 
aesthetic level. When it reverted to his personal screeds and diary, it lost 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have lost other people who were not identifying with the gay 
obsessions he was," says Marowitz, former artistic director of the Open Space 
Theatre in London and one of the key players in the rise of Joe Orton and 
others. "What's more interesting is to get a gay artist who is able to 
extrapolate outward, than somebody who was imploding into gay concerns. It's 
not only the prevailing disease, it's become the prevailing cliche." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, Fleck's fellow LATC grantee, disagrees. "I think John is one of the 
most amazingly talented thinkers and performers I've seen in this racket. The 
sex stuff in his work is just more generally confusing than about gay identity. 
</P>
<P>
"John's work is exploring his complex identity, part of which is as a gay 
person and part of which is as this androgyne that he is, which is larger than 
a particular gay person's experience," continues Miller, who is co-director of 
Highways performance space in Santa Monica. "I've seen very diverse audiences 
be totally drawn in by John." 
</P>
<P>
Adds High Performance magazine editor Steve Durland: "What's misidentified 
about Fleck is that he's been lumped in with Tim, Holly and Karen -- all of 
whom are extremely outspoken and extremely political. Anybody who's familiar 
with the other people knows that John's just there because they all got their 
grants taken away. 
</P>
<P>
"The (canceling of NEA funds) has forced him to talk about his work in a way 
that he normally avoids, the way any artist when challenged will have to speak 
about their personal political convictions." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck was first forced to take a stand by the television coverage. "Oprah was 
the peak," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"She introduced me as 'an artist who deals with homosexual issues and (who) in 
his last show urinated onstage and, as he was reading from a Bible, mimed 
vomiting into a toilet. In another show, he made love to himself dressed as a 
man and a woman in his underwear.' My mouth was just dropping. 'Thanks for the 
intro, Oprah, you sow.' It was a freak show. I thought they would treat me like 
an important artist. You live and you learn." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck's gripes about Oprah notwithstanding, there were worse consequences of 
the sudden celebrity. Fleck says he got up to 150 phone calls a day from 
neo-Nazis during a five-day period, with over 200 calls on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous callers began phoning at around 8 a.m. and kept it up until 2 
a.m., Fleck recalls, playing a punk song that went "We're fascist, fag-bashing 
skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
"It was driving us crazy," he says, referring to himself and painter-dancer 
Ryan Hill, with whom he lives. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I guess a lot of people are afraid of this material. I must be doing 
something right to get this kind of response. I feel that if I've got a voice, 
I've got to use it all the more." 
</P>
<P>
One of the lightning rods that has drawn so much fire -- from those who've 
never even seen Fleck's work -- is the religious symbolism. If those Catholic 
icons seem at home in this baroque milieu, though, it's because Fleck comes by 
them honestly. 
</P>
<P>
The product of a Cleveland Roman Catholic upbringing -- in a family with six 
kids and an alcoholic father -- Fleck moved around every six months or so for 
the first 10 years of his life. "My father just always had to have a different 
job," he recalls. "He'd build a house and we'd move, he'd build another and 
we'd move." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck makes no bones about where the dysfunctional family references in his 
work come from. "(My parents) fought like cats and dogs. He was an alcoholic, a 
real man's man. She had a baby every couple of years to keep the family 
together. She had seven -- one died. It wasn't all that bad, but they would 
have been better off if they'd gotten divorced, but they didn't do that back in 
those days. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a good escape into Catholicism," says Fleck. "My biggest prayers were, 
'Oh please God' -- I said this in all earnestness -- 'let my father die.' For a 
long time I used to pray, 'Oh please let me be a beautiful woman.' I used to 
have this fantasy of being Constance Kennedy, John Kennedy's adopted daughter. 
Then David Bowie came along and I got out of all this stuff and just dyed my 
hair orange and wore my platforms and didn't have to pray anymore. I was 
beeeyouteeful." 
</P>
<P>
Fleck came to California in 1973 to attend acting school, although he'd never 
acted prior to that. He was a member of the first graduating class of the 
Pasadena branch of the East Coast-based American Academy of Dramatic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Really, though, he came to get away from his family, most of whom still live 
near Cleveland. Since that entry into the West Coast whirl, Fleck has done the 
California thing with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a lot of different therapies," he understates. "Gestalt, 
psychotherapy, transactional analysis, est, Adult Children of Alcoholics, The 
Forum, A Course in Miracles. Neuro-linguistic programming was kind of 
interesting, but I couldn't get into. I've done 'em all. Right now I'm reading 
'The Drama of the Gifted Child.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago -- about the time his father died -- Fleck started making 
performance art, taking the trek from club to club as he developed his acts. 
He's created dozens of shows, from 5-minute quickies to full-length, often 
employing his operatic singing voice and a peculiar sense of irony and the 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
In "I Got the He-Be-She-Be's" (1986), Fleck sang jazz and pop tunes while his 
male and female halves battled each other for domination of his body. 
</P>
<P>
In "Psycho-Opera" (1987), a futuristic bank of TV monitors provided the 
backdrop for the tale of Leyland, who talks to characters on the monitors, 
demonstrating the lethal -- and funny -- influence of media on the American 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck manages to keep his two careers going, even with all the hullabaloo of 
the past year. "Certainly Hollywood didn't come knocking," he says. "Most 
casting people were reading about it and I think I got a lot of calls out of 
curiosity, to see who I was. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I felt a little odd on an audition for some producers and directors. 
They said, 'Oh, now don't go peeing on the floor.' You laugh, but they went on 
a little too much about it. 
</P>
<P>
"(The NEA controversy) sure didn't get me any work, but I don't think it's 
necessarily been bad for me either. I was always hoping my performance artwork 
would generate more interest in TV and film, but it isn't the case 
necessarily." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fleck has yet to land that one breakthrough role, on the boards or the 
big or small screen. "He's not going to have a career unless Nicolas Cage 
dies," says Durland. "They're both such distinctive people that there probably 
isn't room for both having major careers at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
"I made my mind up to let it go," says Fleck of a recent spate of call-backs, 
but no big jobs. "At least I have some power and control in my own work. I did 
do an episode of 'WIOU' recently -- as a homeless person who thinks he's a dog 
and barks a lot. It was another freak role, but, hey, it was a week's work. I 
can always kvetch about where I think I should be, but I'm doing OK. 
</P>
<P>
"This schedule thing -- wondering if I'm far enough along -- that's what 
happens when you're about to turn 40." 
</P>
<P>
That midlife milestone, in fact, will be the subject of his new work for LATC. 
Combining motifs from American folk mythology, Fleck plans to tackle both his 
own personal changes and the changes he sees America going through. 
</P>
<P>
"I love America," says Fleck. "But, hey, we've got a few problems. You have to 
look at the wounds. That's the only way they'll heal. America's in a big state 
of denial now about a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Strong words perhaps, from someone who never thought of himself as an activist, 
let alone a gay political performance artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't only deal with homosexual behavior," says Fleck, now much more 
articulate about his own intentions and beliefs than he was before the NEA 
controversy. "I deal with dysfunctional issues like alcoholism and cultural 
issues like homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the big deal, me urinating into a toilet onstage? I think we should be 
worrying about the 70,000 (homeless) people in the city that I live in, trying 
to find a pot for these folks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thrust in the political limelight, into this 'gay political artist' 
stand. Now that's part of my work and I have to deal with it. But up until 
(recently), I'd never really thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hate these extremes: you're good or you're bad, you're gay or you're 
straight, you're Democrat or Republican. There's 360 other colors in-between. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking to an iconoclast whose mission in his work is to turn 
conventions upside down. I hate stereotypes. They limit people in their life 
experience," he adds, seemingly aware he might be sounding uncharacteristically 
strident. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a humanist that believes in the full range of human sexual expression. I 
call myself a trisexual. There's hetero, there's homo. There's bi. Now there's 
tri. I say try it, you might like it. But don't forget to use a rubber." 
</P>
<P>
That's the serious, but not-so-serious, Fleck talking -- constantly 
undercutting himself. Likewise, there's a moment in "Blessed Are All the Little 
Fishes" -- and in several Fleck works, for that matter -- when the rational 
Fleck gets the better of the goofy Fleck, a kind of psychological cruise 
control that overrides his admittedly inspired theatrical hijinks. 
</P>
<P>
Like Fleck the performer, Fleck the man is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde routine, 
with the Apollonian and the Dionysian constantly duking it out for top billing 
just as Fleck's male and female halves do in "I Got The He-Be-She-Be's." That's 
what the notorious second act monologue in "Fishes" is really all about. 
</P>
<P>
It's also what Fleck the unwitting activist is about. Forced into a political 
identity he never intended, he's still uncomfortable with the part, as though 
he could lapse into a feather-boa aria at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"After it all happened, I said I never want to apply for a . . . grant again," 
Fleck says, clearly less than nostalgic for his trial-by-fire introduction to 
the national public eye. "Regardless of whether I get money or not, I'll do 
what I have to do, even though having a money base certainly helps you to 
produce and focus. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'll apply," announces Fleck, suddenly bold and maybe even a bit 
surprised at his own ability to assume a rebel persona. "And I'll always be a 
little footnote in NEA history."

THE LURE OF THE AMAZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Amazon has been one of those fascinating locations that Hollywood has often 
gone to, without going there. In the old days, jungle sets were created on 
sound stages. 
</P>
<P>
But today's more sophisticated viewers expect the real thing and they got a 
pretty good look at the forests around Belem in John Boorman's 1985 "The 
Emerald Forest." 
</P>
<P>
With world attention focused on the South American rain forest, filmmakers are 
more anxious than ever to load up on inoculations and head for the jungle. 
Besides "At Play in the Fields of the Lord," the Amazon is being visited for 
these film projects: 
</P>
<P>
Amazon: an action-adventure story about a Finnish man who ends up in Brazil 
after pulling the plug on his comatose wife at home. Stars Finnish actor Kari 
Vaananen and Americans Robert Davi and Rae Dawn Chong. Finland's Mika 
Kaurismaki directs and co-produces. The film premieres in Finland next month; 
no American distributor has been set. 
</P>
<P>
The Stand: a love story from screenwriter Tom Schulman, reuniting director John 
McTiernan with his "Hunt for Red October" star Sean Connery. The film is 
scheduled to go into production in the Amazon in January. 
</P>
<P>
Rain Forest: a fictional story involving a Chico Mendes-like environmentalist, 
being written by Lewis John Carlino for producer Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
The Chico Mendes Story: No title has been determined for the Warner Bros. film 
that will be produced by David Puttnam from a script by William Mastrosimone. 
The script is based, in part, on former Times reporter Andrew Revkin's "The 
Burning Season," a current nonfiction account of the Mendes legend. JACK

THE GUARNERI'S 'HIGH FIDELITY'; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMY AWARD WINNER ALLAN MILLER EXPLORES ON FILM THE 26-YEAR-OLD RELATIONSHIP 
OF THE SUCCESSFUL STRING QUARTET 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How have four top musicians managed to perform, tour and negotiate constantly 
with one another for 26 consecutive years without sacrificing their 
individuality or their ensemble? 
</P>
<P>
So asks Allan Miller's film, "High Fidelity -- The Adventures of the Guarneri 
String Quartet," opening at Laemmle's Monica on Wednesday for two weeks. The 
85-minute documentary, which unfolds to music of Haydn, Schubert, Mozart and 
others, has as much to say about relationships as it does about music. 
</P>
<P>
From the film's opening moments on, violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John 
Dalley, violist Michael Tree and cellist David Soyer show their personalities 
as well as their musical prowess. In rehearsals as well as at rest, their 
interaction lets the audience know both how much they respect one another and 
how often they are exasperated by one another; what they don't say is often as 
interesting as what they do say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are innumerable relationships in a quartet -- each person with each 
other person, two against two, three against one -- and they all switch all the 
time," says Miller, an Oscar-winning filmmaker who is co-artistic director of 
Symphony Space theater here. "The '60s motto was 'Let it all hang out,' and you 
can't let it all hang out in the string quartet. There are certain boundaries 
as to what you dare say to the other person if you want to preserve the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it has a musical setting, this film is about people whose 
relationships are familiar to all of us. Husbands and wives, lovers, business 
partners or teammates always have to be careful that they're not totally open 
with each other. We're all looking for closeness, but sometimes that closeness 
contains ingredients that might merely provoke distance." 
</P>
<P>
Those sorts of issues intrigue Miller, who had been analyzing the musical 
process on film as far back as "The Bolero," his Oscar-winning 1974 short 
subject about Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic preparing to perform 
Ravel's "Bolero." His films highlight the human side of his subjects, and his 
ideal audience is clearly one packed with both proven and potential music 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't hurt that among the hundreds of chamber groups around the country, 
few are so film-worthy as the New York-based Guarneri. Not only is it the 
oldest quartet around with the same personnel throughout its history, but its 
members are both articulate and engaging. The quartet has been the subject of 
three books and several radio and TV shows; it has even been referred to in the 
Wall Street Journal as "the Grateful Dead of the classical music world." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 57, had wanted to do a film about a string quartet for many years when, 
in 1986, his longtime producer Walter Scheuer indicated that funding for such a 
film would be available. The Guarneri agreed -- Scheuer says the negotiations 
lasted maybe 12 minutes -- and Miller's camera crew started trailing the 
quartet on stage and off, into the recording studio and to receptions, on 
planes and at the breakfast table. 
</P>
<P>
Shot during the Guarneri's 1987-88 season, "High Fidelity" tracks the musicians 
getting into cabs, receiving medals and tending their gardens. The film begins 
in Baden-Baden, Germany -- where we even get to listen in as they read a 
contract aloud -- and stops everywhere from a lawn party in Tampa, Fla., to an 
autograph session in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
There are some very candid moments in the film, particularly a sequence shot on 
an airplane where violist Tree almost pleads with violinist Steinhardt for more 
chances to play violin. Tree concedes that such segments later felt "slightly 
embarrassing" but says he and his colleagues found nothing objectionable in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, continued negotiation is fairly routine for chamber groups. A few 
years ago, Chamber Music America published a monograph called "Can This 
Marriage Be Saved?" Its authors, Janice Papolos and Howard Herring, surveyed 
chamber groups and found, among other things, an "extremely high attrition 
rate" even for very successful groups. The reason: "Most groups founder and 
fall apart simply because the members can no longer live with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The Guarneri musicians are clearly an exception. Three of the four men met as 
students at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and even lived in the 
</P>
<P>
same boarding house for a while. Cellist David Soyer, who was already 
performing professionally, caught up with them at the 1962 Marlboro Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, the four men formed the Guarneri Quartet. Each still teaches, performs 
and records without his Guarneri colleagues, and all have successful individual 
careers as well. 
</P>
<P>
"High Fidelity" opens here more than a year after its New York debut, and 
Miller says only that the delay "had to do with negotiations for the right 
location." After New York, where it received very good reviews, the film played 
30 to 35 other cities around the country, including Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The film reunites the directing and producing team of "From Mao to Mozart: 
Isaac Stern in China," which won an Oscar in 1981. Although he did not receive 
director credit, Miller reviewed footage shot in China and worked with editor 
Tom Haneke for almost a year condensing more than 200,000 feet of film into 
"Mao to Mozart's" 84 minutes. Haneke also edited "High Fidelity." 
</P>
<P>
Neither film has made any money for its producers, says arts patron Scheuer, a 
businessman whose family's Four Oaks Foundation funded these and several other 
film projects. But 11 years after "Mao to Mozart" was made, Scheuer says, 
"hardly a week goes by that it isn't playing somewhere in France or 
Switzerland, or at a benefit." Scheuer says the film has made "in excess of 
$150,000" for Carnegie Hall, its predetermined profit recipient, and "another 
$100,000" at fund-raisers for music conservatories in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Guarneri manager Harry Beall says "High Fidelity" hasn't led to a booking 
bonanza -- he says the quartet limits itself to 100 dates worldwide each year 
anyway -- but that film too has been shown at conservatories and music schools 
since its debut in summer, 1989. And Tree says one New York public relations 
firm even showed it to key executives to illustrate effective group dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
The Guarneri project also sparked a new and unrelated film on last year's 
Czechoslovakian revolution. Writer Marie Winn, who has translated Vaclav 
Havel's plays into English, is also Miller's wife and accompanied him and the 
Guarneri to Prague in 1987. There she had a secret interview with Havel, Miller 
says, adding that the tape of the interview was smuggled out in an instrument 
case marked "Guarneri rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, Winn and Scheuer went back to Prague in December, 1989, a month after 
the November revolution, "when things were already fairly well settled, but 
still fluid" and started filming. They have made several trips since then, 
filming both in Prague and around the country, as well as acquiring material 
from Czech TV and underground film sources. Miller expects the film to be 
finished this spring, but says events keep changing the total picture so 
quickly, "the film will probably end with a question mark rather than with any 
conclusive point of view." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting film, which may be destined for either theaters or TV, will be a 
personal study of five or six university students who participated in the 
revolution, weaving in their pre-revolutionary lives. Tentatively titled 
"Children of the Revolution," it also reflects Miller's continuing interest "in 
the personal relationships of people who are working together as part of an 
important group or are involved in important events together. Those are the 
things which are universal -- they cross national and generational boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
Still to come is a film about a conductor. Miller, who has an M.A. in music 
from Harvard, studied conducting with Hermann Scherchen in Europe and has 
worked as a free-lance conductor. He's now co-writing a screenplay for a 
feature film about a conductor, he says, and has long wanted "to explore the 
conductor's psychic motivation, leadership, need and total unchallenged ability 
to govern, manipulate and manage so many forces." 
</P>
<P>
Such European countries as England, France and Germany have long produced more 
programs for TV about the musical process and musicians, says Miller, who has 
made many documentaries for public television. "We don't do that very much in 
this country. We're interested in talk shows, where we get to meet stars of 
various fields in their rather stagy moments of friendliness with the 
interviewer, plugging a book or a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But we in this country have very little contact with performers in their 
'day-to-day' lives, and in their professional struggles. Most of that is 
private, but some of it is not. And the part that is not offers a marvelous 
avenue into not only their lives but their art."

THIS YEAR'S POP FRESHMEN MIX AND MATCH TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ice Cube is the first record artist to make a second appearance in Calendar's 
annual salute to pop's 10 most promising new arrivals of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial Los Angeles rapper was on last year's list as a member of 
N.W.A, whose "Straight Outta Compton" album both ignited and defined the West 
Coast gangsta-rap movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on his own, Ice Cube, who contributed many of the key images and raps to 
the "Compton" collection, delivered a solo album -- "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted" 
-- that was even more ambitious and provocative, though nothing in it prompted 
an FBI official to write a formal letter of protest, as an N.W.A song did. 
</P>
<P>
 The following U.S. major-label debuts reflect the diversity of a pop scene 
that is struggling to redefine itself during a period when rock's creativity 
and impact are being challenged by rap and techno-pop. At least half of the 10 
artists, significantly, are experimenting with the pop form by mixing hip-hop 
or metal with traditional pop, rock or R&amp;B styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In drafting the list, the emphasis was on artistic potential and vision, not 
on sales. Mariah Carey, whose debut album has outsold all but one of the 
artists cited here, may have a great voice and she may someday develop a strong 
musical point of view. The same thing, however, was said about Whitney Houston 
in 1985, and we're still waiting for a personal stamp to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 These 10 artists offered a glimmer of a pop vision in their 1990 debut works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell Biv Devoe 
</P>
<P>
Bell Biv Devoe's "Poison" (MCA) -- "Our music is mentally hip-hop, smoothed out 
on the R&amp;B tip with a pop feel appeal to it," this talented New Edition 
spinoff trio declares on its album cover, underscoring the growing willingness 
of key artists to step beyond the artificial pop boundaries that have been 
erected in recent years by conservative radio programmers. The encouraging 
thing about Bell Biv Devoe isn't just that other musicians might be inspired by 
their blend of traditional R&amp;B and contemporary hip-hop, but that record 
companies -- noting the album's 2 million sales -- will begin encouraging 
artists to become more innovative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Black Crowes 
</P>
<P>
The Black Crowes' "Shake Your Money Maker" (Def American) -- Chris Robinson, 
the lead singer of this Georgia band, and Rich Robinson, his guitar-playing 
brother, offer lively, accessible music that is a cross between the good-time, 
R&amp;B-accented rock of the Faces and the rawer, Dixie-fried stylings of 
Lynyrd Skynyrd -- a combination that may sound too dated to compete for our 
attention in 1990. But the brothers, who also write the songs, swagger through 
their engaging debut album with an authority that has made the Crowes one of 
the quiet but welcome success stories of the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Digital Underground 
</P>
<P>
Digital Underground's "Sex Packets" (Tommy Boy) -- Ice Cube and Public Enemy 
gave us the most compelling rap albums of the year, but the Underground 
delivered the most entertaining. Another group that isn't shy about fusing and 
rearranging traditional pop forms, thiscrew combine the freshness of De La Soul 
with the comic persona of Tone Loc in such inviting novelties as "Humpty Dance" 
and "Doowutchyalike." Just when you think the novelty of "Sex Packets" has worn 
off, another playing makes you a fan all over again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
808 State 
</P>
<P>
808 State's "90" (Tommy Boy) -- Part of Manchester's high-energy dance-rock 
contingent, this techno-conscious outfit deals in such a streamlined version of 
post-Kraftwerk synthesizer grooves that it can easily be mistaken for a 
seamless, new-age band if the album is played too softly. But pump up the 
volume in a club or on your own system and the music -- with clever world-beat 
samples, frequent wit and silky allure -- becomes as stylish and engulfing as 
the best of Soul II Soul, one of last year's freshman class members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Gear Daddies 
</P>
<P>
Gear Daddies' "Billy's Live Bait" (PolyGram) -- One tendency of ambitious and 
talented young songwriters is to reach for big, central issues in hopes of 
hitting on purposeful anthems. But writers -- from Dylan to Springsteen -- 
often tell us far more about the human condition by concentrating on life's 
everyday moments. Thelonious Monster's Bob Forrest and the Replacements' Paul 
Westerberg have been especially effective in recent years at relating on this 
personal level. That's also the strength of Martin Zellar, whose 
Minneapolis-area quartet combines the basic, bare-bones rock style of the 
Replacements with a touch of the country color of the early BoDeans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John Wesley Harding 
</P>
<P>
John Wesley Harding's "Here Comes the Groom" (Sire/Reprise) -- Harding, a brash 
former Cambridge student who throws words around with the dazzle and bite of 
Elvis Costello, may be a true find or just this year's model. He has a great 
sense of rock tradition, but isn't awed by it, frequently playing off classic 
rock reference points in the songs. The question is whether he'll focus his 
rich imagination and craft, or let his apparent obsession for racing on to new 
ideas keep him from adequately polishing his work. If he finds the discipline, 
he could be a major contender in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ice Cube 
</P>
<P>
Ice Cube's "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted" (Priority) -- Ice Cube leads us here on a 
rap tour of the projects that is so ugly and combative that the Village Voice 
has now taken three cracks at trying to come to grips with it. Is it OK to use 
offensive language to convey the degree of a brother's frustration and rage? If 
we can draw a lesson from literature and film, the answer is clear: There is no 
obligation to be polite or to have a moral attached. Beneath Ice Cube's rage, 
there is the sense of an artist struggling to understand himself and his 
community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jesus Jones 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Jones' "Liquidizer" (SBK) -- This snarling, sometimes cynical band from 
England mixes a bit of the melodic, psychedelic currents of '60s rock with 
post-punk guitar assault and sampled hip-hop rhythms -- it's only natural that 
they cite influences as varied as the Byrds, Sonic Youth, Public Enemy and 
Faith No More in the liner notes. Besides its cocky, kick-down-the-door 
insistence, the band doesn't tell us much about its future direction in the 
album, but there is enough commentary in the lyrics and tunefulness in the 
melodies to suggest considerable talent and range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mazzy Star 
</P>
<P>
Mazzy Star's "She Hangs Brightly" (Rough Trade) -- Don't take the inevitable 
Cowboy Junkies comparisons too seriously, because they undercut the originality 
of this Los Angeles band and play into the hands of those who are writing off 
the Junkies after a somewhat disappointing second album. Still, anyone who 
appreciates the Junkies' quiet, soulful country and blues seasoning should find 
much to admire in singer Hope Sandoval and guitarist David Roback's graceful, 
bluesy blend of urban anxiety and country-accented innocence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Dance Squad 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dance Squad's "Mental Floss for the Globe" (Arista) -- Here's another 
rock group, from Holland this time, interested in stretching pop boundaries. 
The liner-note thank-yous give an indication of the various Caribbean and 
hip-hop influences at work: Prince Buster Campbell and the Beatles to James 
Brown and Public Enemy. But the racially integrated Dance Squad is equally 
aggressive thematically, striking out at racism, stereotypes and apathy. The 
direction isn't any more defined than that of Jesus Jones, but the band asserts 
an independence and authority that bear monitoring.

Here's how The Times' Freshman Class of '89 fared during the past 12 months: 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry: Dubbed "the Joni Mitchell of hip-hop," the young Londoner capped 
1989 with a Grammy nomination for best new artist. But Cherry was quiet during 
1990 except for a radical version of "I Got You Under My Skin" on "Red, Hot and 
Blue," the new Cole Porter anthology album. She is now working on a new album, 
due next spring. 
</P>
<P>
De La Soul: The flower-power rap trio's "3 Feet High and Rising" album finished 
first in both the Village Voice and New Musical Express critics' polls in 1989 
and earned the group a Grammy nomination for best rap album. A new album, "De 
La Soul Is Dead," is scheduled for release in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Kravitz: The New Yorker became an MTV favorite with "Let Love Rule" and 
was the opening act on tours with Tom Petty and David Bowie. He wrote and 
produced Madonna's new single, "Justify My Love," contributed to the "Return of 
Superfly" score and is finishing a second album, featuring collaborations with 
Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash. 
</P>
<P>
Mary's Danish: Picked by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the five new acts to 
watch, the energetic Los Angeles-based alternative-rock band fronted by singers 
Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager has just released a live EP and video, and 
will release its second album early next year. 
</P>
<P>
N.W.A: The rap group that put Compton on the musical map drew national 
attention as the target of a letter from an FBI official accusing its stark, 
urban "documentaries" and fantasies of encouraging violence against law 
enforcement officers. Chief lyricist Ice Cube went solo, but the recent N.W.A 
EP "100 Miles and Runnin' " shows the remaining four quite capable of raising 
issues and eyebrows. An new album is due in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul: Jazzie B's musical "family" became the most honored new soul 
group during 1990. It won two Grammys, virtually swept the Soul Train Awards 
and garnered more American Music Awards nominations than any other act for the 
debut album "Keep On Movin'." A second album, "Vol. II -- 1990 -- A New 
Decade," got mixed reviews, but has sold nearly a million copies in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Stone Roses: The leading act of the heady, "neo-psychedelic" scene in 
Manchester, England (as featured in major stories in Calendar and Rolling 
Stone) continues to be the sensation of the British pop world and a hit on 
college/alternative radio in the U.S. But its long-awaited U.S. tour was 
cancelled in favor of working on the crucial second album, which is promised 
for spring. 
</P>
<P>
Soundgarden: The most prominent act of the dark-hued new-metal/alternative-rock 
Seattle sound received a heavy-metal Grammy nomination, while singer Chris 
Cornell earned kudos from no less a wailer than Axl Rose. The band's at home in 
the studio now preparing its second major-label album. 
</P>
<P>
Texas: From the Scottish Highlands but influenced by the wide open spaces of 
its namesake state, the young group proved even more stirring in concert than 
on its atmospheric, enticing debut album. A second album is due in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Tone Loc: The long-awaited follow-up to the 2-million-selling debut album 
"Loc-ed After Dark" is still a ways off, but Tone (who was nominated for a best 
new artist Grammy last year) been busy contributing songs to film scores 
(including "Marked for Death" and "The Return of Superfly") and making cameo 
acting appearances (the "Ferris Bueller" TV series and the film "The Adventures 
of Ford Fairlane").
