Residents watching the cutting of a 90-foot spruce selected as the U.S. 
Capitol's Christmas tree went scurrying for cover when the falling tree twisted 
out of control and crashed across a road. 
</P>
<P>
The giant spruce toppled onto a truck-mounted crane that was waiting to haul 
the tree away Saturday. Ten feet broke off the top of the tree when volunteers 
tried to move it at the Kootenai National Forest in northwestern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, woodcutters felled a nearby tree deemed acceptable by the Capitol's 
landscape architect when he visited the forest in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to say it went perfect the first time, but it didn't," said Bill 
Crismore of Libby, who had been given the honor of cutting the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 61 feet of the tree can be shipped to Washington because that is the 
length of the enclosed rail car that will carry it. The 41-year-old spruce will 
be erected on the west front lawn of the Capitol.

SUIT TO CHARGE THAT KEATING HIDES MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holders of American Continental Corp. debt securities are expected to sue 
Charles H. Keating Jr. this week to freeze what they allege is more than $100 
million that he has put into foreign investments and bank accounts -- money 
gleaned through transactions involving Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, a 
lawyer for the debt holders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate aim of the class-action suit is to gain access to 
Keating-controlled money in Switzerland, the Bahamas and Panama, said Joseph W. 
Cotchett Jr. of Burlingame, one of the lawyers for the holders. The suit, a 
copy of which was obtained by The Times, will restate the racketeering and 
fraud allegations that debt holders have made in another lawsuit that is also 
pending. The latest suit will be filed today or Tuesday in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles, Cotchett said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Keating and his family unlawfully converted debt holder 
funds over two years to their own use by transferring money out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Keating denied that Keating or any of his executives had 
engaged in any fraudulent activities involving overseas accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contains details of alleged transactions that federal S&amp;L 
regulators apparently did not know before they seized Lincoln on April 14, a 
day after its parent company, American Continental of Phoenix, filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations in the suit are claims that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keating's son set up a foreign currency trading company in Zurich, 
Switzerland, and Dusseldorf, West Germany, and paid it $20 million for "unknown 
reasons." The suit claims that the payment was designed to cover up a transfer 
of money for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keating caused Lincoln to pay $25.5 million to DIA Holdings Overseas, a 
Netherlands company, for reasons that "have never been explained."

A STEADY RISE FOR THE BROWN REPUBLICAN; 
</P>
<P>
LATINOS: MAINSTREAM ORGANIZATIONS LIKE LULAC ARE OPENING THEIR DOORS AND 
COMPROMISING THEIR IDEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

State Northridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when U.S. Mexicans were born Catholics and born Democrats. 
Republicans were considered los cocos, the bogymen. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, this mindset began to change. Taking their cue from 
President Richard Nixon's strategy of enlarging the GOP share of Latino 
middle-class voters, brown Republicans bored from within major Latino 
organizations, founding local chapters that were used as stepping stones to 
national policy-making positions. Since many of them were businesspeople and 
professionals with flexible calendars and money to travel, they acquired 
visibility and power beyond their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The success of these brown Republicans was facilitated by the left's 
abandonment of mainstream Latino organizations; by the popularization of the 
"Hispanic" label, which, by embracing Cuban-Americans, encouraged greater 
tolerance for conservative ideas, and by two decades of almost uninterrupted 
GOP occupation of the White House, which gave brown Republicans the keys to the 
Latino political kingdom -- access to government. Soon los cocos were vying 
with liberals for the political endorsements of -- and policy-making jobs 
within -- Latino organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The most flagrant and successful example of brown Republican infiltration of a 
major Latino organization has occurred in the 140,000-member League of United 
Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The apparent marriage of never-say-die 
Republicans, Democrats-turned-Republicans and conservative Democrats has given 
birth to an environment within LULAC that welcomes the likes of the Coors 
Brewing Co. and GOP elected officials. Twenty years ago, such a development 
would have been unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, LULAC's conversion to toleration, no matter how damaging to 
the Latino community's interests, prompted six national Latino associations to 
call off the historic Chicano Coors Boycott five years ago, after Coors 
promised affirmative action in hiring and money for Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Coors has flaunted its presence at LULAC functions, according to 
its critics. They have accused the brewery of being the campaign treasury for 
brown Republicans seeking LULAC executive positions. So potent was the GOP 
threat at the 1988 LULAC convention in Dallas that Democratic factions put 
aside deep differences to close ranks and defeat Republican Rafael Acosta's bid 
for the organization's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the fight-back campaign had begun a year earlier, when some members 
discovered a memo written by LULAC's then-vice president, Oscar Moran, urging 
the U.S. Senate to confirm Edwin Meese as attorney general. Officially, LULAC 
had opposed Meese because of his weak civil-rights record. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last month, the infighting has intensified. Liberals and moderates 
on LULAC's national executive board voted 14-10 to suspend its charitable 
foundation's board of directors. Many of the ousted directors were Republicans, 
according to sources on the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Republicans comprise a small minority within LULAC. But they have 
adroitly used the organization's local councils to popularize their causes and 
ingratiate themselves with the GOP's movers -- like Bill Coors. He was guest of 
honor at last month's scholarship fund-raiser put on by LULAC's Orange County 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Coors is hardly a friend of the Latino community, having fought passage of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act. And the Coors foundation and family routinely contribute 
to right-wing groups that militantly oppose expansion of civil and human rights 
in the United States. LULAC's decision to honor Coors represents a clear break 
with its founding ideals. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of los cocos within LULAC and other Latino organizations should not, 
however, set off a Latino stampede toward the Democratic Party. After all, 
Democrats helped prepare the ground for GOP advances in the Latino community by 
failing to provide a competitive vision. 
</P>
<P>
But the turn-thy-cheek mentality of Latino organizations like LULAC comes at a 
high price: They are losing their moral authority to speak for low- and 
moderate-income Latinos. The Latino community thus could face a time when it 
might have no national forums to voice its needs and grievances.

SAUDIS SECRET STAKE IN MARINA

<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, a deal is a deal, right? Wrong. All five county supervisors have received 
money (contributions) from Abraham Lurie, and let him violate the terms and 
conditions of his lease, our lease. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking major land in Marina del Rey that was shored up with county money 
and then co-ventured out into private enterprise so that the land could be 
developed and we, the county, would receive the rent and have the taxes paid. 
</P>
<P>
Now this guy Lurie doesn't pay his taxes, fails to develop a major parcel, goes 
into default (foreclosure) on loans, and slides in some Middle Eastern arms 
brokers as unnamed "secret" partners; all in clear violation of his land lease 
with us, the citizens and land owners of this county land. 
</P>
<P>
Our guys say they didn't know about the defaults on loans and tax liens, but 
maybe they didn't want to know. The county recorder's office and private 
services notify immediately of these types of delinquencies. And, the 
violations they did know about, well, they just let them slide by without any 
enforcement of the conditions of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
I think the articles showed the tip of the iceberg and I encourage your 
reporting team to dig further into the hand-holding that's going on. We don't 
need this guy Lurie; anybody can do business poorly. Let's call his leases and 
get someone in who can really develop these parcels and manage them correctly.

Saudi Arabia's embassy in the United States has great respect for the accuracy 
and responsibility of The Times but would like to clarify a reference in the 
article of Nov. 12, regarding a report that two Saudi businessmen had made an 
investment in Southern California for a younger son of the king. The young man 
is 16 years old and still in school. Neither he nor anyone else has authorized 
any Saudi, American nor other business person to handle any financial matter on 
the young man's behalf in this situation nor any other one. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to another part of the article, the embassy also wants to reiterate 
its government's firm position that no agent, whether Saudi or foreign, is 
allowed in connection with any Saudi defense purchase. 
</P>
<P>
As to the rest of the article, the embassy does not comment on the business 
activities of Saudi firms or individuals or of Americans doing business in 
Saudi Arabia so long as those activities do not violate our laws or those of 
the host country.

(State Supt. of Public Instruction) Bill Honig is to be commended for his 
change of position regarding the teaching of evolution. I also agree that we 
should not withhold scientific facts from our children, but let's be sure we 
teach all sides of the issue -- those things that are proven facts along with 
those that remain theories. To say that evolution in total is a fact is just 
not a true statement.

DRIFTNET FISHING ISSUE STILL TANGLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has taken the controversy over large-scale ocean driftnet 
fishing to the United Nations -- where it belongs -- but Japan is not making it 
easy to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
American officials want to set a deadline for imposing limits on the use of the 
nets because of growing evidence of the massive and indiscriminate killing of 
mammals, birds and other sea life caught incidentally in the treacherous nets. 
That enormous kill already is threatening environmental devastation in some 
areas of the Pacific Ocean, which is why the United States is pressing for 
prompt action. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, apparently responding to international criticism of the practice, has 
offered a rival resolution to the U.N. General Assembly calling for further 
scientific study and "other regulatory measures, including a moratorium on 
driftnet fishing, if available scientific data confirm the need for such 
measures." That could effectively postpone action for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is highly sensitive politically in Japan, Taiwan and Korea, whose 
fleets do most of the large-scale drift net fishing in international waters. It 
is also a sensitive issue among American fishermen because many of them use 
small-scale driftnets. Some 35% of the American salmon catch in Alaska waters 
is with driftnets, according to a State Department official, and driftnet 
fishing in other coastal waters, including those of California, has drawn 
criticism because of the numbers of marine mammals killed incidentally in the 
operations. But American scientists argue that the incidental kills with the 
small-scale driftnets is small by comparison with the loss of life in the 
30-mile-long nets used by the Asian fishermen and do not have the same 
environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much time has passed for the United Nations to restrict its action to the 
study of scientific data, which we believe already demonstrates the devastating 
effect on the environment of this indiscriminate and wasteful fishing 
technique," Ambassador Jonathan Moore, alternate U.S. representative to the 
U.N. General Assembly, said when introducing the American resolution on Nov. 6. 
He is right. And his call for action at this session of the Assembly is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. resolution would impose a moratorium on all high-seas driftnet fishing 
by June 30, 1992, unless there has been agreement that the unacceptable impact 
of the practice can be prevented and that the practice does not interfere with 
the conservation of ocean resources. In effect, that places the burden of proof 
on the driftnet fishermen, where it belongs. It is encouraging that the 
American resolution already has attracted support from such nations as 
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and some of the Pacific island nations.

TEACHING EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How appropriate it is that you should have printed on the front page one 
article on the unraveling of the human genome ("Genetic Detectives on a Roll") 
adjacent to another on the still plastic guidelines on the teaching of 
evolution in public schools ("Panel Agrees to Alter Evolution Guide on Texts," 
Nov. 9). If evolution were not a reality, how could these detectives be on a 
roll? If the creationists gain control will they stop all work in this field 
since it supports an evolutionist's viewpoint? 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 16th Century in Italy, the greatest astronomer of his 
day (Galileo) supported the "theory" that the earth revolved around the sun, 
contrary to ecclesiastical opinion. We now see in our country a similar burying 
of one's head in the sand by many who should know better with regard to the 
"theory" of evolution. Galileo was afraid that if the church "won" all future 
advances in mathematics and physics would occur outside Italy. After his death, 
future events proved how right he was on this point. Will we follow a similar 
path?

SAUDIS SECRET STAKE IN MARINA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Saudis secretly obtaining large interests in Marina leases with the 
blind approval of the Board of Supervisors offends me, it most certainly does 
not surprise me. With possibly one exception, this board almost invariably 
represents interests of big money -- not the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
It angers me that the citizens of the county continue to tolerate the board's 
cozy relationship with land developers (desecraters is a more descriptive term) 
merely because they, and other fat-cat moneyed interests contribute much more 
to campaign funds than can the average voter. 
</P>
<P>
It is high time the voters of Los Angeles County demand a return in the 
governance of the county. Such reform should begin with increasing board 
membership to at least nine members. Such a size increase would insure more 
equitable representation. 
</P>
<P>
A second step should be a separation of powers. Five men should not have total 
control over all county functions and decisions. At the very least, legislative 
and executive powers should be separate. Some authority, directly responsible 
to the people, i.e., elected, should have veto powers over the continuing 
exploitation of this county's land and people by five, money-hungry 
politicians.

PEN and the sword: More than 700 writers from the U.S. branch of the 
international PEN literary club -- including Arthur Miller, Ray Bradbury, Noam 
Chomsky and Philip Roth -- have urged Argentine President Carlos Menem not to 
pardon military officers found guilty of human-rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
PEN petitioned Menem after 80 congressmen protested the possible pardon of 
seven senior military officials, including two former presidents, serving 
prison sentences for directing the systematic kidnapping, torture and murder of 
an estimated 20,000 civilians. The suppression occurred during Argentina's 
1976-83 "Dirty War" against suspected leftists. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling: An Atlanta judge has ruled that civil-rights pioneer Julian Bond must 
undergo blood tests to settle a paternity dispute. The magistrate told Bond and 
Deborah Kay Moore that they had 30 days to decide on a laboratory to test their 
blood and that of Moore's 1-year-old daughter. Moore says the child is the 
result of her relationship with Bond, who recently divorced his wife of 28 
years. 
</P>

Ouch! Frank Gifford had this to say of Howard Cosell in Gentleman's Quarterly 
magazine: "At this point in his life, Howard should be a revered elder 
statesman instead of an angry old man. I don't understand the bitterness that 
came out of this guy against everyone who supported him and protected him -- 
and I mean protected him -- on every given Monday night."

Tongue-tied: President George Bush continues adding to his reputation for slips 
of the tongue. Speaking at the AFL-CIO convention in Washington last week, he 
called the labor organization the "AFL-CIA." "That was a Freudian slip," the 
embarrassed President said. Bush is a former director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency.

WINE AUCTION GARNERS BOUQUETS

<TEXT>
<P>
When wine collectors get together they tend to say things like, "The level on 
this is perfect -- 2 inches!" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a whole roomful of them gathered Saturday night at the Four Seasons 
Hotel, uttering phrases only they can make sense of. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the first International Rare Wine Auction benefiting the 
American Institute of Wine and Food, a nonprofit group dedicated to stimulating 
research into areas such as health, ecology, food labeling and food supplies, 
as well as promoting scholarly interest in gastronomy. 
</P>
<P>
As Julia Child, who co-founded the group, put it: "If art and theater and dance 
are fine arts, gastronomy should be, too, because it's more important than any 
of them. None of them could survive without gastronomy, could they?' 
</P>
<P>
Because many collectors contend that Los Angeles has become a major 
wine-collecting capital, the institute plans to conduct its auction annually 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the great wine collectors live in Los Angeles," said Richard Graff, 
chairman of the event and chairman of Chalone Inc. 
</P>
<P>
John Strobel, the co-owner of the three Angeli restaurants and whose wife, 
Carla, coordinated the night, observed: "I have a 150-case collection myself 
and that's small compared to other people in this town." 
</P>
<P>
What's happened in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"Money," explained screenwriter James Orr ("Three Men and a Baby"). "For years, 
people thought San Francisco was the West Coast center for wine, but when 
there's disposable income, people start to wonder how to enhance their lives, 
and wine enhances your life. I don't do sports. I don't collect art. I make 
movies and collect wine, and that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
Other wine enthusiasts in the crowd included AIWF honorary co-chairman Robert 
Mondavi; Steve Wallace, owner of Wally's liquor stores; vintners Molly 
Chappellet and Robert M. Sinskey, there with Loraine Sloan; Citrus' Marvin and 
July Zeidler; producer Tom and Patti Skouros; and Dorothy Cann, president of 
the French Culinary Institute in New York. 
</P>
<P>
As for the auction, several hundred bottles, magnums, double-magnums, 
jeroboams, salmanazars and nebuchadnezzars (the largest bottle size, which 
serves 80 people two glasses apiece) were on the block, including several 
hand-painted by artists such as Chuck Arnoldi, Joe Goode and Ed Moses. 
</P>
<P>
For those who didn't know any better, auctioneer Dennis Foley of Butterfield 
&amp; Butterfield provided pertinent information such as, "This port is 
drinking absolutely beautifully now." 
</P>
<P>
But it was "Dinner with Julia" -- a meal for six, prepared by Child, with wines 
provided by Graff -- that brought the night's highest bid of $5,500, a write-in 
by Roy Smith of Juno, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Shanken -- editor and publisher of the Wine Spectator, sponsor of the 
event and AIWF honorary chairman -- offered the second highest successful bid: 
$4,100 for a case of Chateau Petrus, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ford, who arrived from Ripley, Tenn., for the event, not only donated a 
$1,000 nebuchadnezzar of Schramsberg Napa Valley Brut, 1986 ("You'd have to 
chill it in a bathtub!" giggled Child), he also bought it back for $1,500. Why? 
"I went to so much trouble getting it made, I'd like to keep it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the auction, Ford and the other guests continued their discussions about 
wines, including their levels, which refers to how much wine has evaporated 
through the cork from a bottle over time; a good level means not too much wine 
has evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
The guests also grazed on food prepared by a dozen of Los Angeles's finest 
restaurants, including silver-dollar-sized lamb sandwiches from Palette; tuna 
pastrami from Trump's, and shrimp chipotle from Rebecca's. 
</P>
<P>
"Interesting!" declared Child as she bit into a brownie.

CITY OF HOPE REAPS A BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $3 million was raised for the City of Hope when the Food Industries 
Circle, a group of retailers, broker organizations, distributors and 
manufacturers, staged its 14th annual Harvest Ball at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in the words of Circle president Al Marasca, a time to "transcend the 
rivalries of the game of business." 
</P>
<P>
The $3.1 million raised in 1989 -- chiefly through the group's Coupons of Hope 
program and dinner ticket sales -- was a new record. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the Friday event was "An Evening on the Orient Express." A 
pre-dinner cocktail reception featured foods from the countries served by that 
famous train, each dispensed from a booth decorated in European style. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the ballroom, guests listened to Big Band tunes from Horace Heidt Jr. 
and his orchestra, while thumbing through the souvenir program -- a hefty 
volume the size of a phone book filled with advertisements from food companies, 
retailers, and, strangely enough for a medical center benefit, ads for Marlboro 
and Newport cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests on hand were Dr. Sanford M. Shapero, president and CEO of the 
City of Hope; Richard S. Ziman, chairman of its board of directors; dinner 
chairman Maurice Charlat; Harland Polk, chairman of the Coupons of Hope 
program; and 1,800 other guests. 
</P>
<P>
After an invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance, guests dined on steak, 
broccoli, potatoes and fresh berries while the Modernaires sang and video 
screens set up around the ballroom flashed images of the City of Hope and past 
Harvest Balls. 
</P>
<P>
Charlat made the after-dinner speech, thanking past presidents of the Food 
Industry Circle, and presenting Marasca with a commendation from the city of 
Los Angeles for his work with the Circle. 
</P>
<P>
But the special guests of the evening were three people who had been directly 
helped by the City of Hope; the video screens displayed brief retrospectives of 
their lives before they were brought out in person. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Stephen Wayne Miller received treatment at the City of Hope for 
cancer. Now a senior at West Covina High School, Miller was there, along with 
Marilyn Gaffney, who had had treatment for leukemia at the City of Hope several 
years ago and had gone on, with her husband, to adopt several 
difficult-to-place children. 
</P>
<P>
The guests seemed to respond most to young Tuhk Potter, an Oregon boy who was 
diagnosed at the age 4 as needing a bone marrow transplant. Potter, an amateur 
singer, was seen on video performing for his siblings; they all came on stage 
at the program's end with Gaffney and Miller to sing a song thanking City of 
Hope for its help in their medical recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
The program concluded with each guest taking a penlight favor from the table 
and illuminating the room with 1,800 points of light, symbolizing both the 
medical center and the assistance provided by the Food Industries Circle.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: MENTAL ILLNESS AND CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 24-year-old son who is a brilliant student of music and a 
talented composer became very depressed recently because a cousin of mine told 
him that his aunt, my sister, had been institutionalized for manic-depression. 
I knew he was unusually sensitive and I'd prefer that he hadn't been told this; 
however, I'm going not to lie about this now. How can I help him not to be so 
disturbed by this news? -- H.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR H.S.: There's nothing to be ashamed of about mental illness, and the fact 
that your sister is suffering from this disease certainly doesn't mean that 
your son will be a victim. While manic-depression seems to be a genetically 
inherited characteristic, it can skip generations within a family. It's an 
illness that can be treated -- often successfully -- with medication. 
</P>
<P>
You son might be interested in knowing that recent research suggests a link 
between manic-depression and creativity. The relatives of those who are 
mentally ill, or those who exhibit only mild signs of mental illness, often are 
unusually creative. Experts theorize that there may be a genetic or biological 
predisposition for creativity, so that a person who is susceptible to mental 
illness may also be predisposed to creativity. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband and I are truly shocked that my younger brother 
and his wife could go on with their plans to take an extended European 
vacation, even though our 80-year-old father passed away last week. This seems 
so insensitive to me, and we interpret it as a strong indication that he didn't 
really love his father as much as he claimed. -- B.T.V. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.T.V.: You and your husband are being needlessly harsh on your brother. 
How a person treats someone when he or she is alive is a much stronger proof of 
love than how he behaves at the funeral or after their death. The fact that 
your brother is continuing with his vacation plans is absolutely no indication 
that he didn't love his father. 
</P>
<P>
People express grief in different ways. This is especially true when elderly 
people die. Their death is usually anticipated and may even come as a relief to 
family members. This doesn't mean they don't love the aged person, but it may 
mean that they don't wish to see him suffer, or they wish to spare him some of 
the indignities that so often come with aging in our society. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Camille Wortman, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, points out 
that it isn't inevitable that severe distress or depression must follow a loss. 
People don't realize how common it is for grief to be borne lightly, nor is 
there any evidence that, when it is, the people are denying the loss or didn't 
truly love the person.

Biggest Box-Office Bombs: "Inchon," the disastrous war epic produced by the 
Rev. Sung Myung Moon's Unification Church, has been selected as the biggest 
box-office fiasco of the 1980s. In a ranking of box-office disasters of the 
'80s by their losses, 1982's "Inchon," with Laurence Olivier and Jacqueline 
Bisset, was said to have a net loss of $44.1 million. The rest of the Top 10 
most spectacular failures, in order, were "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" 
(net loss $43 million), "Ishtar" ($37.3 million), "Heaven's Gate" ($34.5 
million), "The Cotton Club" ($31 million), "Pirates" ($30.3 million), "Rambo 
III" ($30 million), "Santa Claus" ($29 million), "Lion of the Desert" ($28.5 
million), "Empire of the Sun" ($27.5 million), and "Once Upon a Time in 
America" ($27.5 million). The list was compiled by Baseline, an L.A.-based 
entertainment research firm. Shauna Snow

POP AND JAZZ CAPSULES : INNOCENCE MISSION: DREAMY DAY AT THE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poetry -- real poetry -- is a rarity in pop music lyrics. But Karen Peris, of 
the young Pennsylvania quartet the Innocence Mission, writes with economical 
grace and romance harking back sometimes to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. And 
Peris has a stunning voice (halfway between Kate Bush and Natalie Merchant) and 
melodies to match. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that was lost in an echoey mix at Cafe Largo, where the band opened a 
three-night engagement on Saturday, but the music, centering on Peris' gauzy 
keyboards and her husband Don's guitar, took on more dynamics than on the 
band's new debut album: a sound track for a dreamy day at the fair. The set was 
stingy (just 45 minutes) and perhaps a tad too low-key, but then it was just 
the band's first show of its first-ever tour. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Himmelman -- last seen doing "Hava Nagila" on the recent Chabad telethon 
with his father-in-law Bob Dylan and Harry Dean Stanton -- proved more seasoned 
as a solo acoustic opening act, reporting, in his best songs, on his search for 
eternal truths in a transitory world and imparting simple wisdoms between songs 
with an effectively offhand, jocular manner. 
</P>
<P>
The fine pairing concludes its Largo stint tonight, while the Innocence Mission 
is scheduled to perform live on KCRW-FM's "SNAP" program Wednesday evening.

POP AND JAZZ CAPSULES : THE ENCHANTED 'JOURNEY' OF LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's appropriate that Ladysmith Black Mambazo's next album is titled "Journey 
of Dreams." It's hard to imagine a more fanciful trip into international pop 
celebrity than that taken by the 10-man a cappella Zulu group from Durban, 
South Africa, which appeared at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium on Friday. But 
even if Paul Simon had not spotlighted the group on "Graceland," it's likely 
Ladysmith would have still gained attention. In each elemental rush of breath, 
the group's rich, haunting harmonies resonate with the innocence of free play 
and the profundity of spiritual values. 
</P>
<P>
Whether singing in Zulu or carrying the simplest of English love lyrics, these 
voices suggest another kind of phantasmagoric journey, from ancient war chants 
to hymnals to American field hollers to street-corner doo-wop, finally brought 
home and reinterpreted at the source. Because of the culturally specific 
format, Ladysmith's show tends to become repetitive, especially since almost 
all of the material is in the same key. And the more politically acute listener 
might wish for some reference to apartheid. But that doesn't mean there's any 
lack of spirit here; Ladysmith Black Mambazo's elegant, hypnotic sound is 
testimony enough to how truly visionary art can rise above a state of 
oppression. CRAIG LEE

Acting for AIDS Funds: Actors and theater companies across the nation have 
scheduled special events this week to raise funds for members of Actors Equity 
who have AIDS. The annual Actors Equity Fights AIDS Week, today through Sunday, 
will see the theater community involved with bake sales, flea markets, craft 
fairs, raffles, car washes, memorabilia and poster sales. Cabaret performances 
will also raise awareness and funds. Some companies will make audience appeals 
for donations at performance intermissions. Since setting up its Equity Fights 
AIDS fund-raising organization in 1987, the actors' union has raised $600,000, 
which has been distributed directly to more than 500 Equity members to offset 
medical and other expenses. Shauna Snow

MESTER LEADS PASADENA SYMPHONY AT CIVIC AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geography and a flair for orchestration were the ties that bound Saturday 
evening at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Jorge Mester's second program for the 
Pasadena Symphony was a hyper-familiar French affair. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece was a dry, sparkling account of the Ravel Piano Concerto in G 
by Jean-Efflam Bavouzet in his local debut. The 26-year-old Frenchman played 
with poise, grace and clarity and projected a keen sense of architecture and 
understated drama. 
</P>
<P>
Mester and his Pasadenans accompanied tidily enough. Their sound was light but 
not fluffy, supporting Bavouzet's cool approach with balanced, accommodating 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the concerto were two program-music classics. Mester began with a 
raucous, occasionally effortful, vigorously chuffing reading of Honegger's 
"Pacific 231." He respected the inventiveness and brashness of the score, 
downplaying the pictorial elements. 
</P>
<P>
Mester and Co. delivered all the sentimental, fevered visions of Berlioz's 
"Symphonie fantastique," however, in a performance torn between fastidious, 
chamber-music detail and sheer sonic bravura and athleticism. The orchestra 
produced abundant, sometimes edgy and ill-tuned, sound, and solo playing of 
great character and skill, on behalf of Mester's indulgent, vivid, 
schizophrenic interpretation.JOHN HENKEN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'SOPHIE'S PLACE' DELIGHTFUL BUT DEMANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Jordan's delightful, confounding and highly demanding 90-minute animated 
"Sophie's Place," which Filmforum presents tonight at 8, takes its title from 
Istanbul's vast and ancient St. Sophia's Cathedral, now a museum. Jordan states 
that the Greek word philosophia means to love wisdom, and the film seems to 
express Jordan's pursuit of it. In production for five years, "Sophie's Place" 
is a collage of brightly hued cutouts from Victorian prints, and it has the 
charm of an old Valentine. Yet its imagery is actually tantalizingly complex, 
and the film unfolds like a Dali-esque dream with continually mutating and 
repeated motifs of many things, in particular: butterflies; a sad, androgynous 
face painted on a quaint balloon, and all manner of phenomena emerging from tea 
cups. The entire film is said to be spontaneous, unplanned and unedited. Jordan 
will appear in person. Information: (213) 276-7452, (714) 923-2441.

"Carrie," William Wyler's 1952 film of Theodore Dreiser's "Sister Carrie," 
screens Saturday at 8 p.m. at LACMA's Bing Theater as part of a tribute series 
to the late Laurence Olivier. Unjustly neglected among Wyler's fine literary 
adaptations, it emerges as a sweeping, period-perfect, ill-fated romance in 
which Olivier's successful middle-aged Chicago restaurateur throws his life 
away for Jennifer Jones' naive but ambitious country girl. Daringly, Dreiser 
suggested that life in a sweatshop could be a worse fate for an unskilled young 
girl than being a "fallen woman." Information: (213) 857-6010. 
</P>
<P>
Among the weekend offerings in the UCLA Film Archive's "Cinecitta: Fifty 
Years") are Bernardo Bertolucci's 1982 "Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man," which 
screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater, and Giuseppe Bertolucci's 
1985 "Secrets, Secrets," screening Sunday after the 7:30 p.m. presentation of 
Nanni Moretti's "The Mass Is Over" (1985). 
</P>
<P>
For its first 90 minutes, the two-hour "Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man" seems like 
a conventional TV movie, in which the son of a self-made Parma cheese magnate 
(Ugo Tognazzi) and his elegant French wife (Anouk Aimee) is kidnaped. Then, 
suddenly, everything falls into place, making clear that what has concerned 
Bernardo Bertolucci uppermost is not politics and plot but psychology and human 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Bertolucci's superb, enigmatic "Secrets, Secrets" features seven of 
Italy's most vibrant and beautiful actresses from three different generations. 
It is at once an observation of mother-daughter relationships and of 
camaraderie between very different women. Although warm and expansive in the 
Italian tradition, it traces the tragic domino effect of one act of political 
terrorism. Bertolucci does not judge the film's terrorists or even seem at all 
interested in their motives, but instead presents terrorism as a fact of life 
in contemporary Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The film's central figure is the rich, aristocratic Laura (Lina Sastri, who 
resembles the young Irene Papas), who not only assassinates a judge in a 
deserted Venetian square, but also coolly guns down one of her own followers, 
perceiving him a weak link in her gang. We discover the impact of his death 
upon his gorgeous, devoted half-sister Rosa (Giulia Boschi) and her mother 
(played by an ever-radiant Rosanna Podesta, who once played Helen of Troy). 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to reconcile Laura, the cold-blooded killer, with the charming, 
considerate woman she is with her own mother (Lea Massari), with whom she 
shares a spacious flat. She is even patient with her mother's self-absorbed 
friend (Stefania Sandrelli), who is recovering from a suicide attempt. Only 
Laura's childhood nanny (a majestic Alida Valli) senses that Laura is not what 
she seems. Yet another mother-daughter combination is that of a judge 
(Mariangela Melato) and her small child. 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Bertolucci, whose direction of actresses is as masterful as that of 
George Cukor, seems as gifted as his older brother Bernardo (with whom he wrote 
"1900" and "Luna"). "Secrets, Secrets" may be a commentary upon the effects of 
public acts upon private lives, but it is first of all a gallery of luminous 
portraits of women. Information: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.

other people. The ones that tell us about ourselves -- our pain, struggles, 
contradictions, our secret dreams. Sometimes through other people. 
</P>
<P>
That is surely the case with Noel Harrison's "Adieu, Jacques . . . !," a 
melancholy salute to Jacques Brel, an old friend of the heart. The standard 
Brel show in America is "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living Paris," a 
bouncy, forward-looking encomium that acquaints the theatergoer with a 
repertoire of striking, playful and emotional French songs written by a 
venerated Belgian songwriter and sung in English. It is cabaret revue stuff, to 
be delivered at top energy by a quartet of performers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, starting with the almost audible sigh in its title, listen to Harrison's 
moody "Adieu, Jacques . . . !," playing at Theatre/Theater and sung entirely 
(and articulately) in the original French. Rather than a triumphant affirmation 
of the man, it examines Brel through a glass darkly, catching his complex 
reflection in Harrison's own tortured soul. 
</P>
<P>
The singer-songwriter who died of cancer at 49 was an unshackled optimist who 
refused to go gentle into his good night. Harrison, who met Brel once, admits 
he envies and admires such defiance and decisiveness, "completely committed to 
the fierce, implacable victory of the heart," which he feels he can never 
attain. Thus, "Adieu, Jacques . . . !" informs us about both men -- their 
differences harmonically joined at the psyche in what turns out to be a raw and 
disarmingly naked evening. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison gives us a couple of the stunning Brel standards ("Marieke" and 
"J'Arrive"), but mostly talks to us about the man and delivers a passel of 
splendid songs new to American ears: the laconic "Next to Gauguin," "Vesoul" 
(word-play about familiar marital spats), "Rosa" (a schoolboy's inclination to 
love in Latin declinations), the humorous "Comment Tuer L'Amant de Sa Femme" 
("How to Kill Your Wife's Lover"), "La Chanson Des Vieux Amants" ("The Old 
Lovers' Song") and the nostalgic "Mon Pere Disait" ("My Father Used to Say"). 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't make it all good news, however. Harrison's interpretation of the 
Brel is low energy communion and catharsis. Often too low. And the device he 
has chosen for speaking and singing to us is at the very least cumbersome: 
memories triggered by receipt of a packet of letters written to a deceased 
friend and returned by another. 
</P>
<P>
This opens the floodgates of reminiscence, yes, but also requires too much 
moving to the small desk in the dark, disheveled room, folding and unfolding of 
letters, putting on and taking off spectacles, which mostly interrupts the 
stream of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The set, lights and direction go uncredited, suggesting that Harrison did them 
all himself. At some loss. Because as penetrating as the piece can be, it also 
feels a bit scruffy and untended. It is one thing to wander through another 
artist's soul, illuminating both the explorer and the explored, and it is 
another to give the journey coherence (as opposed to slickness). A better grip 
on what's there would produce louder reverberations. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Thursdays and Fridays, 8 p.m. until Dec. 22. 
Tickets: $13; (213) 871-0210.

Late-Night Pipeline Series -- Neuroses With a Grin 
</P>
<P>
"Two Heads" at the Saxon Lee Gallery is another in the Pipeline company's 
late-night series that can accommodate short, offbeat performance fragments for 
a dedicated crowd. In "The Night Driver," Scott Kelman serves up a 
dramatization of a delicious Italo Calvino treatise on the neuroses of love, as 
a man races along the autostrada towards the woman he wants to leave but isn't 
quite ready to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hilarious exploration of the complex permutations of the event, subtly 
paralleled by the hostile automotive environment and humorously underscored by 
Jay Green's music and sound effects. The whole affair is beautifully suited to 
performance, but Kelman will have to shed his New Yorkish colloquialisms for us 
to accept him as an urbane, complicated and terminally self-tortured Italian. 
</P>
<P>
There is no lack of self-torture in "Help Me Out of This Head With Peter 
Bergman," which constitutes the second half of this bill. Bergman is a 
certifiable zany, erstwhile with the sorely missed Firesign Theatre, and his 
Woody Allenish lament on the fate of the Earth and its inhabitants, especially 
one Peter Bergman, is not new but enduringly funny and perpetually updated. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7525 Beverly Blvd., Saturdays, 10:30 p.m., until Dec. 16 (No performance 
Nov. 25). Tickets: $12; (213) 933-5282 or 629-2205.

'TURN BACK THE CLOCK': SECOND SHOT AT DESTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The week's prize weeper is NBC's "Turn Back the Clock" tonight at 9 on Channels 
4, 36 and 39. Lovely Connie Sellecca turns on the waterworks nonstop in this 
maudlin remake of a '40s melodrama about a betrayed woman who shoots her 
husband on New Year's Eve, then gets to relive the year and perhaps change 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
Sellecca plays successful actress Sheila Powers, married to philandering 
director Barney (David Dukes), whose career is taking a nose dive. Overwrought, 
she kills him when he has an affair with scheming writer Tracy (Wendy Kilbourne 
of NBC's "Midnight Caller"), then wishes she could undo the deed. 
</P>
<P>
Magically, she's given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
It's fascinating and daunting to think of living a year over again. Would you 
try to prevent tragedies? Cash in on foreknowledge? In the blinkered script by 
Lee Hutson and Lindsay Harrison, martyr Sheila wants only to keep Barney -- a 
puzzling goal, because he's such an obvious creep. 
</P>
<P>
She does try to warn her best friend, a burntout young poet named William (Jere 
Burns, the smarmy playboy in "Dear John"), against getting tied up with Maureen 
(Dina Merrill). Maureen, another obvious nasty, will drive poor William to 
violence and a mental breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
But alas, it seems fate won't be denied, no matter how hard Sheila tries and 
tries, and cries and cries. 
</P>
<P>
Or will it? 
</P>
<P>
Burns' performance as a sneering, yet vulnerable cynic almost makes watching 
worthwhile, and Emmy Award-winning director Larry Elikann makes it all quite 
stylish. But he and the cast, including Gene Barry and Franc Luz, are better 
than this.

DRUG LEGALIZATION: INTEREST RISES IN PRESTIGIOUS CIRCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours before the Stanford-Notre Dame football game Oct. 7, a relaxed and candid 
George P. Shultz, wearing a Stanford-red polo shirt, outlined some of his 
philosophical ideas to a group of alumni of the Stanford Business School at 
Memorial Auditorium in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I am out of government I can say this," the former secretary of state 
began, speaking thoughtfully. Then, in a suggestion that would astound and 
infuriate former colleagues in the government, he told the alumni: "We need at 
least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very difficult to say that," Shultz said. "Sometimes at a reception 
or a cocktail party I advance these views and people head for somebody else. 
They don't even want to talk to you." He screwed up his face in mock imitation 
of the shock he has caused, drawing a roar of laughter from the alumni. 
</P>
<P>
But no one ever associated wild and wooly ideas with the cautious and 
conservative Shultz when he served more than six years as secretary of state in 
the Ronald Reagan Administration and two years as secretary of the Treasury in 
the Richard M. Nixon Administration. 
</P>
<P>
And Shultz's current position on drugs does not put him in deepest left field. 
Interest is mounting in academic and scientific circles in the idea of 
legalizing drugs, and the number of those willing to be counted is increasing 
markedly. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Shultz, the list of those advocating at least a study of some form 
of controlled legalization now includes Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton 
Friedman, conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. 
Schmoke, former New York Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, astronomer Carl 
Sagan, Executive Director Ira Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union and 
a significant number of psychiatrists, doctors and political scientists. 
</P>
<P>
To them, making drugs illegal merely fosters crime and violence while failing 
utterly to stop drug use, just as Prohibition of alcohol failed in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Exists 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, however, regards the arguments for legalizing drugs as 
anathema. "There is even a question (among Administration officials) that the 
discussion in itself is a little risky," said Peter Reuter, co-director of the 
RAND Corp.'s drug policy research center. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy and education secretary in the Reagan Cabinet, branded Shultz's ideas as 
"really stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been nice to have known at the time. . . ," Bennett told 
reporters. "This might explain why we weren't putting as much pressure as we 
should have on some of those (drug-producing) nations." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater tried to put Shultz down with 
ridicule. "Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast too long, hasn't he?" 
Fitzwater said. "The guy slips into retirement and right away he starts saying 
things that are strange." 
</P>
<P>
As Shultz himself acknowledged in his talk: "No politician wants to say what I 
just said, not for a minute." Shultz never discussed drug legalization at State 
Department staff meetings, according to department veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I am shouting into the breeze here as far as what we're doing 
now," Shultz told the Stanford alumni. "But I feel that if somebody doesn't get 
up and start talking about this now, the next time around, when we have the 
next iteration of these (anti-drug) programs, it will still be true that 
everyone is scared to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Interest Mounts 
</P>
<P>
Outside the government, however, interest in the idea is mounting in academic 
and scientific circles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enormous closet elite interest in legalization," said RAND's 
Reuter, who describes himself as an "agnostic" on the question. "I address a 
lot of groups of the educated elite around the country and -- even when I am 
talking about something quite unrelated to legalization -- this is the central 
question that they want to discuss." 
</P>
<P>
Few, however, are willing to stand up and be counted on the side of 
legalization. It is not an easy commitment to make, as Baltimore Mayor Schmoke 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Five months after his election in 1987, Schmoke, a former federal prosecutor, 
shocked the U.S. Conference of Mayors by calling for a public debate on drug 
legalization. Schmoke now has no doubt that "someone will run against me 
primarily on this issue" in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction was pretty negative," Schmoke told the Baltimore Sun after his 
speech to the mayors. "My kids had it rough. My son called me from the basement 
of his school. He said: 'What did you say? What did you say?' My daughter, 
Kathy, came home and said: 'The children say you're for drugs and I told them 
you're not for drugs.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schmoke's views closed doors in Washington. Bennett's office -- in preparing 
the Administration's report to Congress on drug strategy -- consulted each of 
the mayors of America's dozen largest cities, except Schmoke. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, which went to Congress in September, Bennett excoriated the idea 
of legalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Legalizing drugs would be an unqualified national disaster," he wrote. "In 
fact, any significant relaxation of drug enforcement -- for whatever reason, 
however well-intentioned -- would promise more use, more crime and more trouble 
for desperately needed treatment and education efforts." 
</P>
<P>
A growing body of opinion holds otherwise. Shultz recommended that the Stanford 
alumni study what he called a "bold and informative article" in a recent issue 
of Science magazine by Ethan Nadelman, an assistant professor of politics at 
Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said that the article helped convince him that "we're not really going 
to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and 
the incentives for criminality out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Nadelman, who has written a large number of articles on legalization in 
prestigious American publications in the last year, has become the de facto 
spokesman for advocates of legalization. He and other legalization advocates, 
including Dr. Lester Grinspoon of the Harvard Medical School, offer this 
reasoning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The current policy -- the war on drugs -- has failed. Neither drug 
interdiction at the borders nor police enforcement within the United States has 
decreased the demand for drugs. Despite all the law enforcement, anyone who 
wants to use crack can buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The drug laws themselves cause most drug-related crime. It is precisely 
because drugs are illegal that they sell for exorbitant prices and those prices 
in turn breed violence by both users and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug users resort to robbery, burglary, prostitution, numbers running and 
drug pushing to earn enough money to feed their habits. As for the sellers, the 
potential profits are so desirable that they frequently murder each other to 
get them. 
</P>
<P>
Breeds Violence 
</P>
<P>
"Illegal markets tend to breed violence, both because they attract criminally 
violent individuals and because participants in the market have no resort to 
legal institutions to resolve their disputes," Nadelman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Legalizing drugs would have the salutary effect of driving their price down, 
Nadelman argued. Taxes might then push the price part of the way back up, but 
because dealers would not benefit, they would not gain the same incentive to 
violence that they now have. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Enforcing the drug laws succeeds only in driving prices up and thus 
aggravating the violence bred by the heavy profits earned by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the marijuana, cocaine and heroin markets were legal, state and federal 
governments would collect billions of dollars annually in tax revenues," 
Nadelman said. "Instead, they expend billions in what amounts to a subsidy of 
organized criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The government has no moral right to treat drugs differently from alcohol 
and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
"Enforcement of drug laws makes a mockery of an essential principle of a free 
society, that those who do no harm to others should not be harmed by others and 
particularly not by the state," Nadelman wrote. "Most of the 40 million 
Americans who illegally consume drugs each year do no direct harm to anyone 
else; indeed, most do relatively little harm even to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Crack Hysteria 
</P>
<P>
None of today's illegal drugs, the critics insist, is as addicting as nicotine 
or as harmful as alcohol. Crack's terrible hold on the inner cities, they say, 
stems not from the power of the drug itself but from the desperation of the 
people smoking it. "Crack is today's hysteria just the way heroin was 15 years 
ago," Grinspoon said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although legalization might encourage some increase in drug use, this could 
be offset by government campaigns to discourage use, heavy penalties for 
driving while using drugs, bans on advertising, taxes that boost prices, 
federal education and treatment programs, prohibitions of sales to minors and 
restrictions on the place and time of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the Draconian laws that stopped the spread of heroin," Grinspoon 
said. "Kids saw what was happening to their older brothers." 
</P>
<P>
These arguments may have convinced Shultz and some other academics of all 
ideological stripes. But they have to overcome 75 years of laws prohibiting 
drugs and all the accompanying images of dope fiends and drug busts and 
heartless murder and filthy needles. To most Americans, the idea of allowing 
the sale of evil drugs without sanction remains abhorrent. 
</P>
<P>
Crack deepens the abhorrence. Government drug officials insist that crack is 
special -- that addicts can rarely break their habit, need ever-increasing 
doses and fall prey to a paranoia that makes them violent. The officials simply 
do not accept the relatively restrained assessment of crack by the advocates of 
legalization. Most news accounts of crack make it seem to be one of the most 
terrifying of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
To the vast majority, drug legalization seems likely to increase drug use. Even 
if legalization would end most drug crime -- an argument not accepted by many 
officials, who insist that a black market in untaxed drugs would spring up -- 
that would still not justify a policy that allowed more people to use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The war on drugs is not about facts. . . , it's not about evidence," said 
Steven Wisotsky of the Nova University Law Center in Florida. "It's about 
symbols of life and death."

BUSH VETOES AID BILL; ABORTION FUNDING CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
President Bush on Sunday vetoed a $14.6-billion foreign aid bill that included 
emergency economic aid for Poland and Hungary because the legislation provides 
$15 million for a United Nations family planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
The President contends that the agency finances compulsory abortions in China. 
</P>
<P>
The President's action marked the third time that he has vetoed a major bill 
containing funding for abortions. Neither the House nor Senate is expected to 
have the votes to override the veto and Congress thus may be forced to strip 
the provision from the bill and send it to the President again. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would provide foreign aid for the 1990 fiscal year, including $532 
million to help the troubled economies of Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
A new bill to replace the one that was vetoed was scheduled to come before the 
House today. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign aid legislation "would clearly place the United States in the 
position of supporting a program that in turn supports coercive abortions, a 
program that is inconsistent with American values," Bush said. The veto drew 
quick responses from both sides of the abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, 
said that Bush's veto tells population control agencies that "if you trample on 
human rights by supporting compulsory abortion programs, you'll get no help 
from the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, criticized the President. 
</P>
<P>
"He's selling out poor women throughout the world for his domestic political 
advantage, a dubious political advantage," said Fornos. "Certainly the rest of 
America is not marching with him in this insensitive, callous action." Bush's 
major objection is $15 million earmarked in the bill for the U.N. fund that 
provides money to China's population control activity. The Chinese have been 
accused of requiring sterilization and forced abortions in efforts to limit 
families to one child. 
</P>
<P>
The President also opposes a section in the bill that prohibits using foreign 
aid to encourage other countries to carry out military activities in violation 
of U.S. law. This section was prompted by the Iran-Contra scandal, in which 
American officials solicited other nations to provide funds for the Contras in 
Nicaragua. The Congress previously had cut off U.S. aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that the legislation would improperly restrict 
the President's ability to conduct foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiaries of foreign aid in the bill would be Israel, which 
would receive $3 billion, and Egypt, which would get $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the foreign aid bill last week, despite the White House veto 
threat. The House originally had bowed to presidential pressure and decided to 
effectively block funding for the U.N. agency. However, on Thursday, the House 
reversed itself and passed the measure in the same form as had the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In other abortion vetoes, the President on Oct. 21 vetoed a bill providing 
funds for two Cabinet agencies, the Department of Labor and the Department of 
Health and Human Services. The funding bill, for the first time since 1981, 
would have permitted federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and 
incest. The House tried to override the veto, but fell 51 votes short of the 
two-thirds majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
A new bill was prepared, allowing federal funding of abortions only when the 
life of the mother "would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term." 
This single exception for permissible abortions has been contained in the 
Labor-HHS spending bills for the last eight years and presumably is acceptable 
to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The President also vetoed an appropriations bill for the District of Columbia, 
because it would have permitted the district government to use locally raised 
funds to pay for abortions.

HOUSE SUPPORTS CHINA STUDENTS ON 403-0 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House on Sunday night voted unanimously to allow more than 30,000 Chinese 
students to stay in the United States indefinitely, despite the strong 
opposition of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to approve similar legislation this week. The 403-0 vote 
in the House could deter President Bush from vetoing the legislation, since it 
reflected a more lopsided sentiment than the two-thirds majority required to 
override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the overwhelming majority of the Chinese students in the United 
States are required to return home for two years after they finish their 
studies here. The legislation, originally sponsored by California Rep. Nancy 
Pelosi (D-San Francisco), is aimed at protecting students Congress fears might 
be punished by the Chinese regime for their support of the pro-democracy 
movement in China. The students also point out that their political activities 
here would be curtailed if students face a forced return to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students actively participated in pro-democracy demonstrations in 
this country, both before and after the army's massacre of unarmed protesters 
in the center of Beijing last June 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Students are in great danger if they go back (to China) at this time," 
California Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, however, appears to be reluctant to antagonize the 
Chinese regime. Administration officials argue that it is in the U.S. interest 
to have Chinese students return to China, thus providing a core of future 
leaders who understand this country. They also contend that if the Pelosi bill 
becomes law, China will retaliate by cutting off future educational exchange 
programs with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to jeopardize the aspirations of tens of thousands of other 
scholars now in China to experience the American academic environment, or the 
desire of thousands of Americans to work and study in the People's Republic of 
China," said the State Department in a memo submitted to Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
China has reacted with harsh rhetoric to any moves that indicate criticism of 
the bloody crackdown against supporters of democratic reform. On Sunday, China 
expressed "utmost indignation" over U.S. sanctions approved last week by the 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador James R. Lilley was summoned to the Chinese Foreign Ministry to 
receive the protest from Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, U.S. diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Chinese government put down the counterrevolutionary rebellion . . . 
the U.S. Congress has meddled in China's internal affairs and stirred up an 
anti-China wave by adopting one resolution after another on this matter, which 
is purely the internal affairs of China," Liu was quoted as saying in state-run 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions approved by Congress represent "another escalation of action to 
further poison" relations between the United States and China, Liu said.

<P>
The congressional sanctions include bans on arms sales, police equipment and 
export of U.S.-made satellites for launch by Chinese rockets. The measures also 
would suspend nuclear cooperation, liberalization of high-technology exports 
and a U.S. investment insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which ordered a cutoff of most high-level official 
contact and suspended military sales to China just after the violent crackdown, 
originally opposed further sanctions. But it accepted the congressional 
sanctions after Congress added a clause that permits the President to lift the 
sanctions whenever he believes it is "in the national interest." 
</P>
<P>
Liu warned Sunday that if the sanctions bill is not killed, "only the U.S. 
government . . . will be held responsible for all the serious consequences 
arising therefrom." 
</P>
<P>
The bill to allow Chinese students to stay in the United States has also 
antagonized the Chinese. The bill would apply to all Chinese students who are 
classified by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for visa purposes 
as having come to this country with the official sponsorship of the Chinese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the 40,000 Chinese students in this country are classified by the 
INS as government-sponsored. This group includes some Chinese students who 
obtain tuition and financial help from universities or other private sources 
rather than the Chinese government, but who have been classified for visa 
purposes as government-sponsored.

BUCK HELM: 90 HOURS IN FREEWAY WRECKAGE CREATED QUAKE HERO; 
</P>
<P>

INTERSTATE IN OAKLAND. RESPIRATORY FAILURE IS BLAMED.

<P>
Buck Alvin Helm, the gritty longshoreman who had become the symbol of survival 
from the massive Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake, died unexpectedly Saturday 
without being able to publicly tell his amazing story. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral will be held Tuesday afternoon in his home of Weaverville. Helm, 58, 
died at 7:30 p.m. Saturday of "respiratory failure" after his condition 
abruptly worsened, a spokesman for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, his death came only a day after doctors optimistically announced 
plans to wean him from a respirator that he had been on since being 
hospitalized in serious but stable condition under intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
"His physicians had been encouraged by his rate of progress but emphasized that 
he remained in very serious condition," said hospital spokesman Ron Treleven. 
"It was still too soon to determine how soon he would recover." 
</P>
<P>
Treleven said that at the request of Helm's family, he could not disclose other 
details of Helm's death or treatment. An autopsy has been scheduled by the 
Alameda County coroner's office and physicians will hold a press conference 
this morning to discuss the death of the man who survived 90 hours in the 
rubble of the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Vasilios B. Choulos of San Francisco, an attorney retained by the family, said 
of Helm's death: "I had every reason to be optimistic, even though he was not 
completely out of danger. Everyone hoped Buck would be off of the respirator in 
a few days and then be able to communicate -- and perhaps be discharged in two 
or three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Choulos said that Helm's former wife, Lorene, who had been constantly at his 
bedside recently, had temporarily left the hospital Saturday evening but 
returned to find a sudden change in the atmosphere at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
She had a "sense of doom" when she saw the looks on the faces of the hospital 
staff, Choulos said. "She knew at that point, in her heart of hearts, what had 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Helm's death was the 67th fatality attributed to the massive quake that rocked 
Northern California, injuring nearly 3,000 people and causing an estimated $7 
billion in damage. Forty-two died in the collapse of a one-mile section of the 
Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that trapped Helm and other motorists beneath tons of 
concrete at 5:04 on a warm, hazy Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The hardy, 240-pound Helm, who commuted weekly from his home in Weaverville, 
250 miles north, to his job on the Oakland docks, had been driving his 
Chevrolet Sprint along the freeway when the temblor struck with a magnitude of 
7.1. 
</P>
<P>
On the following Saturday at 6 a.m., after weary rescue workers had abandoned 
any realistic hopes of saving any more trapped motorists, Helm's moving hand 
was seen in the debris. 
</P>
<P>
Jubilant workers immediately began the painstaking four-hour task of shoring up 
the freeway structure, cutting through the door of the car and pulling him out. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Stone, a rescuer from Tuolumne County, asked Helm, "How's it going?" 
</P>
<P>
"What the (expletive) is going on?" answered the dazed man. 
</P>
<P>
Charles A. Nicola, an Orange County fire battalion chief and one of the scores 
of rescuers who responded to the disaster, asked Helm his name. 
</P>
<P>
"Buck," came the faint reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you hurt?" asked Nicola. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt all over," Helm replied. 
</P>
<P>
Helm was taken first to Highland Hospital in Oakland. He had injuries from head 
to foot, and was diagnosed as having a fractured skull, three broken ribs, 
bruised lungs, kidney failure and a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the startling word of his survival was circulated around the world. It 
was a moment of joy in a grim event marked by death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Helm's colorful nature quickly emerged. The burly man, described by 
friends as strong-willed and "ornery," slept week nights near the docks at the 
Port of Oakland in a yellow custom van emblazoned with the words, "The 
Weaverville Flash." Inside the van he kept small photographs of his four 
children to whom he was devoted: Greg, 35; Marc, 22; Jeff, 16, and Desiree, 12. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers said that they thumped on the van door to rouse the longshoreman for 
his job as a clerk for Stevedoring Services of America. 
</P>
<P>
Lorene Helm, with whom associates said he remained friendly, was flown from 
Weaverville to Oakland to be at his side. The family was nearly overwhelmed 
with requests for news interviews. Producers and agents came forward with 
proposals for movies and television shows. 
</P>
<P>
The family hired a public relations firm to sift through the offers along with 
Choulos, who has been retained by the family and has filed a liability claim 
against Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after the quake, residents of Weaverville, a small community in the 
Trinity Mountains, held a rousing celebration to mark his survival, stringing 
dozens of banners and posters along streets and over shop windows. "Our 
Thoughts Are With You Buck and the Bay Area" proclaimed one sign. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Helm remained in an intensive care unit, first at Highland 
Hospital and later at Kaiser Permanente, visited only by friends and family 
members. All interviews were refused. Choulos said at a press conference Nov. 2 
that although Helm was "a tough bird," he was still under heavy medication and 
had tubes in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the attorney said he would press the claim against the state on 
behalf of Helm's survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Under a bill signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian, victims of the freeway 
collapse may receive up to $200,000 per family without an admission by the 
state of liability. Claimants may reject the offer and file suit in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good case," Choulos said. The freeway section that collapsed 
was built in the 1950s under standards that applied at the time, but since then 
there had been "actual notice of dangerous conditions," an element that could 
render the state liable, he said. The lawyer added that he believed the state's 
cash offer was "probably not" adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Choulos said that the proposals for movies or other entertainment productions 
based on Helm's rescue were now "on hold." He said no agreements had been made 
by Helm and that he had no idea how the longshoreman would have reacted to the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Buck, when he got up, would have done damn well what he wanted to do," 
he said. "Now he's gone, and we all have a common sense of loss."

SHAMIR CALLS DIFFERENCES WITH U.S. 'NORMAL'; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: HIS COMMENT UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT THE TWO NATIONS STILL HAVE NOT 
AGREED ON THE NEXT STEP TOWARD MIDEAST PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of a trying visit to America, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of 
Israel said Sunday that the drum-rolls of discontent in the United States over 
Israeli peace efforts in the Mideast are merely the sound of "normal 
differences" between good friends. 
</P>
<P>
"There were always differences about some issues between the United States and 
Israel," Shamir said. "I think it would be not normal if it was otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Just the fact that the prime minister had to voice what might otherwise pass 
without saying between old allies underscored bilateral disappointment: The two 
countries still have not reached agreement on the next difficult and crucial 
step toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians in Israeli-occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
It also reflected the sharp U.S. complaints that Shamir heard on this trip 
about Israel's military cooperation with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a long way to make together," he said of the United States and 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting with the editor and other journalists of The Times, 
Shamir marveled at the lightning velocity of political change in Eastern 
Europe, as old enemies break down the walls that separate them and where 
democracy is spreading at a gallop. But in the Mideast, he cautioned, lasting 
solutions between embittered foes "will take years." 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, at this moment in the Arab world, democracy doesn't have any 
meaning," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
In expressions of optimism, however, Shamir said Israel's relations with East 
Bloc countries are improving. Full diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union "I 
think will come soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He described as "a miracle" Israel's newly restored diplomatic relations with 
Ethiopia, which has opened the door for 18,000 Ethiopian Jews to emigrate to 
Israel. This will reunite many families who were separated in 1985 when Israel 
secretly airlifted 12,000 Ethiopian Jews out of Sudan in a storied move called 
Operation Moses. 
</P>
<P>
As Israel improves relations with other countries and brings on new waves of 
immigration, however, its economy is put under great strain, Shamir said, but 
Israel will cope. "I am sure we will solve it. We have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
But not alone, he added. "We are looking for the help of all our friends all 
over the world to help us in building housing and, what is more difficult, to 
prepare jobs," he said. "I think in the next few years, this will be the main 
subject on our agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir wrapped up this U.S. visit with a three-day stop in Los Angeles, where 
he spoke to the World Affairs Council on Friday and was the featured guest 
Sunday night at a dinner benefiting the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust 
Studies. En route to the West, he spoke to the General Assembly of the Council 
of Jewish Federations meeting in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
He met Wednesday with President Bush -- a meeting that in planning, execution 
and aftermath seemed designed by U.S. officials to emphasize the Bush 
Administration's impatience over the lack of progress toward Israel's stated 
goal of conducting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a five-point plan to try to 
draw Israel into its first-ever direct negotiations with Palestinians. But both 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization have attached conflicting 
conditions to acceptance of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said that his "differences" with the Bush Administration were not unlike 
those that Israel has had with Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that in the press appear various assessments and descriptions," 
Shamir said to Times journalists at the breakfast Sunday, "but this doesn't 
change the facts. And the facts, the meaning of the facts, are that close and 
friendly relations between the two countries, Israel and the United States, 
including strategic cooperation, continue without any obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "in the Congress it is a different story." 
</P>
<P>
He referred specifically to a closed-door meeting with a select group of 
Congress members who had complained sharply about Israeli-South Africa military 
ties. Bush has also raised the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir picked his words carefully: "The spirit of these discussions was 
friendly -- enough." 
</P>
<P>
As for a solution: "We have tried to analyze it and to understand the concerns 
about it. . . . We decided to have further opportunities to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir told the President that Israel decided two years ago to sever its 
military cooperation with South Africa but would honor contracts "until they 
expire." 
</P>
<P>
During past visits, Shamir has said the policies of Israel enjoy nearly 
unanimous support from American Jews. This time, though, Shamir was faced with 
important notices of dissent from the U.S. Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost was a public letter signed last Thursday by 41 American Jewish leaders 
who told Shamir that "most American Jews" disagree with his steadfast 
reluctance to consider giving up occupied lands in exchange for guaranteed 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy officially seeks such an exchange. But it was considered an 
important milestone when prominent members of the mainstream U.S. Jewish 
community publicly disagreed with the basic peace policy of an Israeli prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Shamir said, "Well, you know, in any democratic society you rarely 
see unanimous support for anything. The problem is: Where is the majority?" 
</P>
<P>
He answered his own question, saying he believes "the great majority of 
American Jewry supports the policy of the national unity government in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Norman Kempster, in Washington, contributed to this story.

BATTLE OF GANDHIS HEATS UP IN HEARTLAND; 
</P>
<P>
INDIA: THEY SHARE THE SAME LAST NAME AND A LEGACY AS GRANDSONS OF NATIONAL 
HEROES. BUT RAJIV AND RAJMOHAN SHARE LITTLE ELSE ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

AMETHI, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not far from the billion-dollar fertilizer factory and the hi-tech jet 
simulators at the Indira Gandhi Flying Academy -- indeed, just a few miles off 
the paved roads that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has lavished on his celebrated 
electoral district -- Rajmohan Gandhi stood in a clearing near the broken-down 
village well, surrounded by the poorest of India's poor. 
</P>
<P>
This was the other India, the wide-eyed farmers and shepherds were told by 
Rajmohan's campaign workers, the real India that the prime minister's largess 
has left behind. 
</P>
<P>
And this rumpled and quixotic candidate wearing a simple garland of marigolds 
and white cloth, they were told, was the other Gandhi -- the real Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
When at last he spoke through a crude, battery-powered megaphone, Rajmohan 
Gandhi, grandson of India's legendary champion of freedom, Mohandas K. Gandhi, 
made it clear why the Indian nation had dubbed this crucial race, "Gandhi vs. 
Gandhi: The battle of the grandsons." 
</P>
<P>
"The values that Mahatma Gandhi stood for have been flouted," he told the 
dirt-poor villagers. "The values that Jawaharlal Nehru stood for also have been 
flouted. And it is Nehru's own grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, who has done this to us. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are to attain these ideals, Rajiv Gandhi must go. He has hurt the honor 
of the nation by his involvement in corruption. He has hurt the democratic 
institutions. He has gathered power in his own hands," he added. "I do not 
compare myself to my grandfather. He was a saint and a revolutionary, and I am 
just an ordinary man. But I have chosen to walk his road." 
</P>
<P>
The course Rajmohan Gandhi has chosen is no less than a frontal assault on 
India's beleaguered prime minister right in his own citadel, Rajiv Gandhi's 
parliamentary constituency. The prime minister must win this parliamentary seat 
during three days of national voting that begins next week if he is to hope to 
continue governing what is widely hailed as the largest democracy on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And for most of the Indian nation, the battle for this 100-square-mile slice of 
the Indian heartland called Amethi has become symbolic of the key issues in the 
nation's most hotly contested general election ever -- Rajiv Gandhi's five-year 
record versus the opposition's charge that the government he inherited from his 
murdered mother in a 1984 wave of sympathy is now corrupt, inept and 
far-removed from the realities of today's grass-roots India. 
</P>
<P>
For Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Rajiv Gandhi's former defense minister who now 
heads the increasingly popular National Front coalition of opposition parties, 
the race in Amethi is an allegory, a staged confrontation between the 
old-fashioned Gandhian morality of the Mahatma and the big-money, hi-tech power 
of India's long-ruling Nehru dynasty. The Nehru dynasty is unrelated to the 
Mahatma and acquired the Gandhi surname only after Nehru's daughter, Indira, 
married an obscure politician named Firoze Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the real Gandhi versus the fake Gandhi," Singh said. "Rajmohan is the 
best symbol of our struggle to restore the values of dignity to the country, 
values which have gotten eroded under this government." 
</P>
<P>
Independent analysts have gone a step further. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying the Amethi election is symbolic of the entire struggle for 
democracy," said Rajni Kothari, a prominent Indian political analyst who, like 
most of India's intellectuals, believes the time has come to end the rule of 
one of the modern world's longest-lived family dynasties. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have Rajmohan Gandhi, a dedicated human-rights worker, going up 
against a prime minister with a foreign wife and an alien government, which is 
running a campaign of money power under a cloud of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the analysts, India's prestigious English-language daily newspapers 
also have turned against Gandhi and his ruling Congress-I party, most of them 
giving wide coverage to charges that the prime minister personally profited 
from tens of millions of dollars in commissions paid in a $1.3-billion arms 
deal with the Swedish armaments firm, Bofors. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Amethi race, the prestigious national daily, the Times of 
India, ran a front-page cartoon recently depicting the ghosts of Mahatma Gandhi 
and former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru sitting on two clouds in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear my grandson is fighting to save the country," the Mahatma tells Nehru. 
"And yours?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just fighting," Nehru replies. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Rajiv Gandhi and his ruling Congress-I party are fighting for their 
political lives in what already is the most sophisticated and costly election 
campaign in Indian history. By any account, Gandhi's party is spending tens of 
millions of dollars on its nationwide fight to win a majority of India's 545 
parliamentary seats. 
</P>
<P>
And nowhere is that largess more visible than in Amethi, where Rajiv Gandhi 
buttons, posters, flags, calendars and other slick paraphernalia are being 
doled out by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, scores of factory-new jeeps, all fluttering the green, saffron and 
white of the Congress-I flag, zip around the roads and dusty tracks of the 
sprawling district, blaring Rajiv campaign slogans through state-of-the-art 
audio systems. 
</P>
<P>
To woo the vote, the ruling party has given away hundreds of campaign 
videocassettes and, the opposition charges, even free television sets. 
</P>
<P>
Such gifts are not new to Amethi, which has received more government 
pork-barrel projects than any other district in the nation since 1981, when 
Rajiv Gandhi won the seat that had been held by his brother Sanjay before his 
death in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
There is the $1-billion fertilizer plant, which provides 6,000 jobs. There are 
now 15 large and 1,231 small-to-medium factories, and there's the Indira Gandhi 
Flying Academy, India's only world-standard civilian facility for 
commercial-pilot training, which is located inexplicably amid villages that 
lack basic electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"How can Amethi possibly vote against Rajiv Gandhi after all he has given 
them?" asked retired Indian Airlines pilot Capt. Satish Sharma, a close friend 
of Rajiv, himself a former pilot, and the man Gandhi has selected to run his 
Amethi campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not just all this development," Sharma added. "It's the rapport that 
Rajiv has built up with these villagers. You know, in these remote villages, 
they call him Rajiv Bhaiya -- elder brother Rajiv. 
</P>
<P>
"And don't believe all this bad press about Sonia Gandhi, either. Here they 
treat his wife as part of the family, also." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is Gandhi's Italian wife, Sonia, and their 17-year-old daughter, 
Priyanka, who have shouldered the bulk of the village-to-village campaigning in 
Amethi for the prime minister, who has been far too busy with a dizzying 
schedule of helicopter, jet and limousine campaign tours for his party's 
candidates around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Sharma's boastful confidence, it remains unclear just how effective he 
and the Gandhi women have been as campaigners. And, in spite of analysts' 
consistent predictions that Rajmohan's austere campaign will never overcome 
Rajiv's massive largess, Amethi's peasants themselves are questioning just how 
secure the prime minister actually is in his own constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Bahadu Sarooj is a typical example. He is the sarpanch, or village head 
man, of Digha, a hamlet of mud-and-straw huts 10 miles from any semblance of a 
road and home to about 900 peasant farmers. 
</P>
<P>
It is in such remote villages that most of Amethi's 900,000 voters live. And it 
is here that Rajiv Gandhi's campaign manager, Sharma, said one must look "to 
see what Amethi really thinks of Rajiv." 
</P>
<P>
But Sarooj, a member of Hinduism's long-oppressed Untouchable caste that is a 
traditional Congress-I vote bank, didn't really think much at all about Rajiv. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know him here," Sarooj said through a translator. "Sonia Gandhi came 
here yesterday. She spoke some few words to us. She gave us these calendars and 
campaign buttons. Then she left." 
</P>
<P>
On the morning after, though, the First Lady's gifts appeared as alien to 
Amethi as the sophisticated Indira Gandhi Flying Academy. Several Rajiv 
calendars were hanging upside down on mud walls and mothers had used the slick 
campaign buttons to close rips in their children's ragged shirts. 
</P>
<P>
It was just down the road from Digha that Rajmohan Gandhi was touring that day. 
In fact some of the children at his small, public meetings were wearing the 
buttons that Sonia Gandhi had doled out the day before -- most of them upside 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"In the times of the British, when the colonial powers got their foothold, they 
used mirrors and beads to dazzle us into following them blindly," Mahatma 
Gandhi's grandson shouted through his jerry-built sound system. "Today, these 
glossy posters and fancy buttons are the mirrors and beads of this day and age 
-- the trinkets Rajiv is using to gain his foothold here." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview beside the broken village well after his speech ended, the 
"other" Gandhi insisted he does have a chance against Rajiv and Congress-I's 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferdinand Marcos also lavished largess on his followers, but in the end Marcos 
failed," he said, referring to the late Philippine leader who was ousted in 
1986. "Largess only succeeds for some time. And the Marcos example is very much 
valid here. You see all these buttons and posters, but there isn't a single 
high school for 15 miles around this place." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Digha, outside sarpanch Sarooj's hut, there was independent evidence 
that Rajmohan may well be right. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the prime minister has done for Digha, which has no power, no 
schools, no paved roads and, in short, resembles most of rural Amethi, the 
sarpanch smiled and said: "You can see what is the condition of my village. And 
it has always looked this way."

Now-disgraced East German leaders built luxury villas of Canadian pine with 
Italian mosaic floors and expensive West German bathroom fittings, the East 
German Berliner Zeitung said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the headline, "Secret Dwellings Behind Thick Hedges," the newspaper 
quoted a former member of the special state company that built the houses as 
saying he understood the villas were for the children, fathers, uncles and 
grandfathers of prominent East German politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said former Economics Minister Guenther Mittag had one of the villas 
and another belonged to the now-dismissed president of the East German 
Parliament, Horst Sindemann. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said it is giving all the material it had researched for the article 
to a special parliamentary commission charged with investigating corruption 
among the fallen East German politicians.

BERLIN'S WALL IS BEING CUT AWAY -- CHIP BY CHIP;

EUROPE: A FEW GERMANS ARE SELLING SMALL CHUNKS OF THE WALL AS SOUVENIRS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All day Sunday, the cold, clear air along the Berlin Wall rang with the clang 
of hammer on chisel and the crunch of rock against concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, the Berlin Wall, for 28 years a symbol of Europe's division, 
is being whittled away. 
</P>
<P>
As a million or more East Germans headed for the shopping districts of West 
Berlin over the weekend, thousands of others promenaded along the 
graffiti-decorated western face of the wall -- and watched hundreds, perhaps 
thousands taking their turn at chipping away at that symbol. 
</P>
<P>
For while the Berlin Wall has been dramatically outdated by free passage 
through new checkpoints, it still stands as the detested barrier between East 
and West. 
</P>
<P>
A few West Berliners were selling small chunks of the wall as souvenirs; others 
wanted to knock a hole in it to look through; and some said they wished to be 
part of history by helping the wall crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I just want to help a little to remove the wall," said Dan Epstein, 23, 
of Berkeley, Calif., a student in London. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty exciting thing for the world," he said. "I think a lot of 
people are here swinging away just to make a statement about the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein carried a large chisel. His friend, Aaron Singer, 22, of Colorado 
Springs, wielded the hammer. They came to Berlin by train last Monday and have 
been watching events at the wall ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Nov. 9 was my birthday," said Singer. "I heard the wall was opened and decided 
to come over. This is the biggest historical event in Berlin since World War 
II." 
</P>
<P>
"The wall is not easy to chip away," added Epstein. "It has got to be the 
sturdiest piece of construction in all of East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
The two Americans said they had been watching the various techniques used for 
breaching the wall. Many of the amateur demolition workers have hammers and 
chisels but some simply pick up rocks to flail away at the structure. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people pick a particular spot and keep plugging away at it," said Singer. 
"We have a pretty good place but it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Singer and Epstein were working at a stretch of the wall that runs south and 
then east from the Brandenburg Gate to Checkpoint Charlie. It is fashioned of 
concrete with reinforced steel rods, 12 to 15 feet high and formed of 
one-meter-wide panels. 
</P>
<P>
So for about every three feet along the wall there are joints sealed with 
mortar, and it is at these connection points that the hammers and chisels are 
levered to best advantage. Right now there are hundreds of small openings bored 
through the wall but no major breach -- except those made by the East Germans 
for the new border-crossing posts. 
</P>
<P>
Other wall-breakers concentrate on the circular rim of the wall, installed to 
prevent escapees from gaining a firm hold on the top of the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
The West Berlin police seem to take a casual attitude toward most of the 
amateurs trying to knock through the west side of the wall, but they quickly 
turn away anyone with professional equipment like power drills. 
</P>
<P>
As evening approached, however, West German police at some locations began 
confiscating hammers and other tools being used to chip at the barrier. Someone 
asked a policeman if he was embarrassed about taking away wall-breaching 
implements, and he replied, "Yes, but this is East German property." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday strollers stopped to watch energetic wall-breachers, many of whom gave 
away the small pieces or sold chunks for a mark or two. 
</P>
<P>
From Hamburg came reports of a much more ambitious commercial scheme. Ten tons 
of freight, described in official documents as "Pieces of the Berlin Wall," 
were put on an American Airlines flight for Chicago via New York, according to 
United Press International. UPI said reporters who saw inside the 19 
rectangular, plain wooden cases strung with nylon netting said they contained 
brownish-black pieces of stone covered with sand and plant roots. The shipment 
was brought to Hamburg airport Saturday on a truck, and sources there told UPI 
that the shipper was a "private citizen in West Berlin." American Airlines said 
it knew nothing about shipper or consignee. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Berlin, the most prized bits of wall are those surface pieces with 
graffiti paint, rather than simply a colorless lump of interior concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with the wall!" called out one youth in English as he slammed a large 
hammer against the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a lively business has sprung up with vendors selling gluehwein -- 
spiced, mulled red wine. 
</P>
<P>
For those peeking through the holes in the wall, there is not much to see -- 
just the barren cleared ground and a few gray barracks-style buildings in East 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance is the second, inner wall, where East German armed guards still 
patrol. For now, that is an unattainable target for the amateur demolitionists 
of West Berlin.

An American working for a leftist rights organization here says she was beaten, 
kicked and "sexually harassed" during 53 hours of detention last week by 
Salvadoran military police. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials said Sunday that they were stunned by the charges, made 
to reporters by Brenda Hubbard of Los Angeles, because they contradicted what 
she told them after her release Friday. But they said they would investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, 41, was one of seven Americans arrested here last week during a 
government crackdown on leftists, foreigners and religious workers thought to 
be sympathetic with guerrillas waging a major military offensive in the 
capital. U.S. Embassy officials said Friday that all have been released and 
that none were physically mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
But Hubbard and Eugene Terril, an American who was arrested with her, told a 
press conference Saturday that they had been kicked and beaten with rifle butts 
at the headquarters of the Treasury Police, a branch of the Salvadoran armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, who gave the more detailed account, said police officers also lifted 
her shirt and thrust their hands into the pajama bottoms that she wore at the 
time of her arrest and throughout her detention. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hubbard and Terril were seized Wednesday morning at the headquarters of 
Comadres, a group that compiles information on leftists and suspected 
guerrillas arrested or killed by the security forces. Seven Salvadoran 
activists were arrested with them. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the group have employed American volunteers on the assumption that 
this would afford them greater protection. Hubbard had worked for the 
organization since moving here in August. Terril, 42, of Eatonville, Wash., 
arrived Nov. 8 to work in a Salvadoran orphanage. Both lived at Comadres 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
They said that police ransacked the Comadres office and forced their nine 
captives to pose for a photograph with a flag of the FMLN, the guerrilla 
alliance. Each was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to police headquarters, 
where Hubbard said she was repeatedly interrogated on the whereabouts of a 
Salvadoran labor activist. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard said the beatings started as the group was forced to stand all day 
Wednesday and intensified that night amid the sounds of heavy combat near the 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when they started beating on us a lot," she said. "That night they 
didn't let me sleep. They kept coming into my cell and kicking me." 
</P>
<P>
Terril said he got the same abuse but that "they treated us like fine china as 
compared with what they did to the Salvadorans. That was probably the hardest 
part. When they hit you, it was easier to take than hearing the Salvadorans 
scream." 
</P>
<P>
The two said the seven Salvadorans arrested with them are apparently still in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Walker on Friday compared the arrests of Americans, 
including four Lutheran church relief workers, during the guerrilla offensive 
to the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a situation here in which the government and armed forces have reason 
to believe foreigners are helping the FMLN wreak its violence on the country," 
he said. "I'm not condoning it. I have not seen hard evidence . . . that 
foreigners are in the trenches with the FMLN." 
</P>
<P>
But embassy officials cast doubt on the two Americans' torture stories. 
</P>
<P>
"They were interviewed by male and female consular officers, then brought to 
the embassy to meet with the consul general," said Robert Dance, an embassy 
spokesman. "At no time did any of them allege physical torture. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stunned," he added. "If they had made this accusation to us, we could 
have jumped on it at the time and made a stronger case (with the Salvadorans.) 
But nothing was said."

SOCIALIST CAPTURES SPOT IN BRAZIL RUNOFF; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: LUIS DA SILVA WILL FACE FERNANDO COLLOR IN FINAL PRESIDENTIAL 
VOTING DEC. 27.

<P>
Luis Inacio da Silva, a former automobile worker representing an alliance of 
Marxists and other leftists, has advanced to a December runoff in Brazil's 
presidential elections, according to official voting returns announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva, known as Lula, will face Fernando Collor de Mello, who portrays 
himself as a centrist reformer, in the runoff Dec. 27. If Lula wins, Latin 
America's largest country will have a socialist president after 26 years of 
conservative government, including 21 years of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
In early returns from the first round of voting Wednesday, Collor seized first 
place by a wide margin. But the outcome of a close race for second place, and 
for the other position in the runoff, remained unclear until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With 98% of the votes tabulated, Lula finally emerged with a definitive lead 
over left-leaning populist Leonel Brizola. 
</P>
<P>
The official count gave Lula 11,391,908 votes, or 16.7%, to Brizola's 
11,120,672 votes, or 15.7%. Collor remained far ahead with 20 million votes, or 
28% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic candidate Mario Covas finished in fourth place with 7.7 
million votes, and conservative Paulo Maluf came in fifth with 5.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lula, 44, is a gruff-voiced man with a stocky build and a black beard. His rise 
to the heights of Brazilian presidential politics is remarkable not only 
because of his leftist ideological position but also because of his 
working-class background and his low level of formal education. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an impoverished single mother, he did not learn to read until he was 
10 and never went beyond grade school. He began working in an automotive shop 
when he was 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
After working his way up to a skilled job as a lathe operator, he won election 
in 1975 as the president of an automotive metalworkers' union in a Sao Paulo 
industrial suburb. In 1979, he attained national prominence by leading a strike 
in defiance of the military regime that then ruled Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The strike movement spread rapidly to become a symbol of popular discontent 
with the military government, which banned Lula from union leadership. He was 
imprisoned in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As the regime eased its restrictions on political activity, Lula helped found 
the leftist Workers' Party, uniting Marxists, Trotskyites, Roman Catholic 
leftists and others who advocate a socialist economic and political system. The 
party's symbol is a red star. 
</P>
<P>
As the party's leader, Lula won election to the lower house of the national 
Congress in 1986, the year after the armed forces turned the government over to 
transitional President Jose Sarney, a conservative civilian. 
</P>
<P>
For the current campaign, Lula's party joined the Brazilian Socialist Party and 
the Communist Party in what they call the Brazil Front. 
</P>
<P>
Lula has promised to work with the private sector and welcome private foreign 
investment in Brazil. But he also has called for suspension of foreign debt 
payments, socialized medicine, agrarian reform and the nationalization of 
public transportation and private banks. 
</P>
<P>
Collor, 40, was a member of the conservative party that supported the military 
government when he was elected to the Congress in 1982. But he switched to the 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which long opposed the military regime, 
before winning election in 1986 as governor of Alagoas, a small state in 
Brazil's impoverished northeast. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, he won national fame by campaigning against overpaid public 
servants called "maharajas." As the presidential candidate of his newly formed 
National Reconstruction Party, Collor drew strong support from Brazil's 
underpaid lower classes, which form the overwhelming majority of the country's 
145-million population. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign strategists have begun presenting him as a progressive social 
democrat in an appeal for votes from the center-left.

BUDGET: THE NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE OUTLINE THEIR CONTINGENCY PLANS. CHENEY 
CALLS PROSPECTS FOR SHARP REDUCTIONS 'A REALISTIC EXPECTATION.'

<P>
The U.S. Navy would have to mothball its fleet of four World War II-era 
battleships, the Army would be forced to cut as many as six divisions and the 
Air Force would need to revamp its proposed production of 132 B-2 bombers, if 
the services are ordered to cut $180 billion out of the defense budget for 
1992-1994, defense sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering these 
proposals and others in the wake of the services' responses to a "worst-case" 
budget exercise ordered by Pentagon Comptroller Sean O'Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed Sunday on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Cheney called the 
prospects for deep budget cuts "a realistic expectation" and warned that 
"there'll be great consternation on Capitol Hill because some of the things 
that will be cut, members of Congress are very fond of." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he had made no decisions on the services' proposals of how to 
absorb the cuts if they are ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Congress had repeatedly warned Cheney that a five-year budget plan he had 
presented earlier this year was unrealistic. Cheney had resisted the calls for 
a new plan. But last week he asked each branch of the military for contingency 
plans, citing the growing federal deficit and what he called a diminishing 
Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that reductions in the Pentagon's five-year budget blueprint would 
require troop cuts, the closure of military bases and the termination of weapon 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
One defense official added that the budget review will reopen questions about 
the need for the Air Force to develop and deploy two new mobile missile systems 
-- the rail-garrison basing scheme for the MX missile and a smaller, 
single-warhead missile widely known as the Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you do the Midgetman if these deficit-reduction targets kick 
in," one Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
In early rounds of debate within the Bush Administration, Cheney argued against 
the development of the $18-billion Midgetman, favoring the cheaper alternative 
of placing existing, land-based MX missiles on rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Cheney said that "we need to add the element of mobility to the 
force." Noting that Congress this year approved funds for the rail-based MX 
system, Cheney said: "I expect that program will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also confirmed that the Pentagon may be forced to scale back its planned 
purchase of B-2 bombers, which he called "still clearly very important." 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly how many we buy and at what rate we buy them I think is an open 
question." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, meanwhile, told Pentagon leaders that it would have neither the men 
nor the budgets to continue operating the fleet's four battleships, two of 
which are based in Long Beach. The battleships require a crew of 1,500 -- a 
substantial manpower drain on a Navy that has warned that it may have to reduce 
its rolls by 76,500 next year alone. 
</P>
<P>
"People were trying to figure out how to use them," one Navy official said of 
the ships that were recommissioned in the mid-1980s at a cost of $1.7 billion. 
While the ships carry 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking land 
targets, the Navy has been wary of using the battleships in such a role. 
</P>
<P>
While some Navy ships would be transferred to the Naval Reserves in a bid to 
save money, the Navy argued that the battleships are too unique to entrust to 
forces that do not train full time. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also said that it would have to discontinue some of its efforts to 
disperse ships to new home ports, a program that already has been scaled back 
by base closures ordered by a special commission at the end of the last 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Army told defense officials Friday that it would have to cut two divisions 
in addition to the four divisions that it has said it would need to cut under 
automatic budget cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Congress and the White House avert the automatic cuts with an 
eleventh-hour compromise on the 1990 budget, the Army believes that it will 
have to cut all six divisions, including one based in Europe, by 1994. The cuts 
would reduce the Army's current force of 768,000 active-duty soldiers and 1.06 
million reservists by about 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six divisions would be mechanized units that depend heavily on M-1 
tanks for mobility and firepower. The Army would likely scrub its plans to 
continue producing the current generation of those tanks, a Pentagon official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said that the Air Force proposed scaling back its purchases of 
F-16 fighter jets and retiring Minuteman 2 missiles early. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently exempt from the Pentagon's latest budget-cutting plans is the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star Wars." Pentagon officials 
said that last Monday's memo directing the budget cuts did not go to the office 
that oversees "Star Wars" programs. 
</P>
<P>
Until notified otherwise, officials from the SDI Office said that they will 
continue to operate according to a presidential order, issued earlier this 
year, directing them to spend $33 billion between 1990 and 1994 to research 
"Star Wars" technologies.

The Supreme Court decision last June that sharply restricted the reach of a 
major civil rights law has resulted in the dismissal of 96 race discrimination 
claims, nearly one every business day since the opinion was issued, a study 
released Sunday by a civil rights group says. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reviewed court actions between 
June 15, the date of the Supreme Court's decision in Patterson vs. McLean 
Credit Union, and Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Judges, acting on their own or at the request of those being sued, dismissed 96 
discrimination claims in 50 cases as a result of the Patterson decision, the 
study by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People found. 
</P>
<P>
In Patterson, the court said an 1866 civil rights law that prohibits race 
discrimination in the making of a contract -- known as section 1981 -- "extends 
only to the formation of a contract but not to problems that may arise later."

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1969, the year man took his first steps on the moon, a young Kiowa poet 
named N. Scott Momaday stunned the literary world when he was awarded the 
Pulitzer Prize for a novel called "House Made of Dawn." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday, then an English professor at UC Santa Barbara, was so shocked he 
thought someone was playing a joke on him. His own publisher couldn't recall 
the obscure book. 
</P>
<P>
But some American Indians weren't too surprised. They knew the poet was 
destined for glory. His last name in the Kiowa language, Mammedate, means 
Skywalker, or One Who Walks Above. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, Momaday has written a second novel, "The Ancient Child" 
(published Oct. 25 by Doubleday), about the spiritual journey of an American 
Indian artist exploring his heritage and the mythology of his people. 
</P>
<P>
The early reviews have praised the book as a dazzling new work. And demand for 
the literary novel has been surprisingly high, considering the author has been 
out of the national spotlight. "The Ancient Child" is already in its third 
printing with more than 20,000 copies published. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the sales -- we can't go back to the printer fast 
enough," said Lisa Eskow, publicist for Doubleday. "We expect the book to 
continue selling quite strongly." 
</P>
<P>
Why has the 55-year-old Momaday, an important voice in American letters, been 
silent for so long? "I don't think of myself as a novelist. I'm a poet," said 
Momaday, relaxing in the living room of his large adobe house during a break in 
his book promotional tour. "It's been 20 years since I wrote 'House Made of 
Dawn,' and I think of it as an aberration. I still feel poetry is the highest 
form of literature." 
</P>
<P>
After his dazzling debut, Momaday wrote two books of poetry and two memoirs. 
None won the same widespread praise nor attention as "House Made of Dawn." 
Momaday admitted he struggled to match the artistic power of his first work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a state of disbelief when I heard about the Pulitzer," said Momaday. 
"It also put extra pressure on me. I had a hard time getting on with the next 
book. What could I have possibly done that would have topped it?" 
</P>
<P>
Most critics wrote highly of "House Made of Dawn." Although he thought the 
novel's narrative was flawed, Baine Kerr in the Southwest Review called it "a 
brave book" in which Momaday "mythicized Indian consciousness into a modern 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
Others condescended to it, suggesting that the fiery politics of the '60s 
swayed the Pulitzer Prize judges to select a nonwhite author. In the New York 
Times Book Review, John Leonard wrote that Momaday's book was honored because 
it was a "safe" choice, "a pet instead of a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's friends scoff at the criticism his early work received. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott was obviously a person of great capacity and promise," said novelist 
Wallace Stegner, who taught Momaday in the 1960s when the poet was a 
creative-writing fellow at Stanford University. "It was clear he could more 
than hold his own among any writers -- minority or non-minority." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday believes the poor reviews and doubts about his novel's artistry arose 
from an ignorance of his American Indian background, a mystical culture of 
animal spirits, gourd dances and creation rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the reviews were perceptive and responsible; some were not," said 
Momaday. " 'House Made of Dawn' must have been very difficult to understand for 
writers from a more privileged experience. The Indian world is one of which 
most people know nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Like authors from James Joyce to Ralph Ellison, Momaday wrestles with questions 
of language, identity and racial ancestry in a civilization that seems to 
destroy cultural tradition rather than preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
His themes from old Indian tales and his haunting lyrical style reflect the 
cadences of Kiowa and Navajo prayers and chants. His dreamy stories and 
characters jump back and forth across time. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel Momaday's strongest writing is not in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 
novel, but in his memoirs, "The Way to Rainy Mountain" (1969) and "The Names" 
(1976). In those meditative works, Momaday makes a pilgrimage to the Devil's 
Tower rock in Wyoming, a great landmark in Kiowa myth. 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's new novel continues his journey across a magical landscape. Its hero, 
an Indian artist named Set, discovers he is the reincarnation of a Kiowa child 
of legend who turns into a bear. The bear chases seven sisters and a brother up 
Devil's Tower, but the siblings escape into the sky, forming the stars of the 
Big Dipper. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's an unusual novel -- much different from 'House Made of Dawn,' " said 
Momaday. "It's a love story, a mythic tale. . . . It even has dime novel 
elements. And it has the old, old idea of a man searching for his identity." 
</P>
<P>
"The Ancient Child" is a largely autobiographical novel. Like Set, his 
character, Momaday is a painter who has had shows in several galleries in the 
Southwest ("I didn't make Set a brain surgeon for a reason," said Momaday, 
laughing). Like Set, Momaday believes that dreams and visions are pathways to 
one's blood ancestry and racial memory. And like Set, Momaday believes the 
violent power of the "bear spirit" dwells inside him. 
</P>
<P>
"With certain animals in the Indian cosmology, you can acquire power and 
benefit from knowing them," said Momaday. "But the bear is hostile, a 
confrontation that can only be expressed as a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Usually the bear is dormant, said Momaday. But it often surfaces in bursts of 
anger and destructiveness, he said. Or it may flood him with a new artistic 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Animal spirits aside, Momaday and his publisher are pushing "The Ancient Child" 
as a quintessential American work. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine it being written in any other country," he said. "No other 
country has Indians, Wild West legends, Western landscapes . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's red adobe home is pure Americana. It squats amid sagebrush and cacti 
in a gently rolling desert area of Tucson, a short drive from the University of 
Arizona where Momaday teaches classes in literature and oral tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His cream-colored Airedale, Sabadotarde (Saturday afternoon) gallops across the 
tiled floor to greet visitors. Momaday is a tall man with slow, graceful 
movements. He wears jeans and a black shirt like Marlon Brando to hide his 
large belly. 
</P>
<P>
"Make me look a lot lighter," he said, joking with a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
The living room and den resemble a private gallery of Indian and Western 
artifacts and Momaday's own etchings and paintings. On one wall hangs an old 
Apache shield made of dried horsehide, human hair and a yellowed bear tooth. It 
looks dull and faded. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are full of power," said Momaday. "I think of them as personal 
flags, coats of armor belonging to one man, representing one man, and he must 
be true to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I hold onto these things because I'm a writer, and the imagination 
and the culture are so important to me," he said. "Somehow, I manage to keep 
one foot in those worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's facial features are clearly American Indian. But his deep, resonant 
voice -- sounding theatrical and Anglo upper-crust -- clashes with his 
appearance. He and his German wife, Regina Heitzer, have a 9-year-old daughter, 
Lore. 
</P>
<P>
"This bicultural identity came naturally to me," he said, sipping a soda water. 
"I was born into two cultures and brought up in two. I learned to exist in both 
worlds fairly early. Even though, at times, I was the only Indian in school, I 
was proud of my identity. And I got into a lot of fights with kids because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
His father, a full-blooded Kiowa, and his mother, part-Cherokee, were 
educators, artists and writers who taught their son about the gifts of language 
and culture -- white and Indian. The family lived on and off Navajo and Kiowa 
reservations in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Momaday attended reservation 
and Catholic schools and then college at the now-defunct Augusta Military 
Academy in Virginia. The student Momaday was well-prepared when he arrived at 
Stanford in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
People soon noticed the young writer from New Mexico. The late critic and poet 
Yvor Winters took Momaday under his wing. Francis McCullough, a classmate and 
editor of the school's literary journal, The Sequoia, would later publish 
Momaday's first novel as an editor of Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Momaday's supporters believe his writing and celebration of the Indian 
oral tradition is a beacon to Anglo writers and readers lost in a soulless 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with most Americans is we don't speak from within a tradition; we 
all speak from outside and try to trample tradition," said novelist Stegner, 
who lives in the Los Altos Hills near Stanford. "Scott has managed to find a 
mythological foundation for his writing, and it's served him well." 
</P>
<P>
In the world according to Momaday, his life reflects his art over and over, 
like the seasons. Each summer, he tries to make it to Oklahoma City to join the 
few living Kiowa for the gourd dance, the tribe's celebration of creation and 
mythology. 
</P>
<P>
"When the drums start rolling and the eagle-feather fan is in my hand, it's as 
if I'm going back 200, 300 years, and my father and grandfather and 
great-grandfather are dancing next to me," said Momaday. "It takes hold of you. 
It's intense and mystical, a kind of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense I am where I ought to be, and where I have always been."

4TH SALUTE TO BLACK FAMILIES ACCENTS POSITIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PARENTING: TWO FAMILIES THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED UNITY AND MOTIVATION WIN ANNUAL 
AWARD. 
</P>

<P>
Between the candy-coated cheerfulness of TV's Huxtables and the negative 
stereotype of drug-obsessed youths and apathetic parents lies the truth of the 
black family, Lucille Boswell believes, and she likes to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth year in a row, she has. As the manager of consumer affairs for 
the Los Angeles office of Coca-Cola, Boswell once again has produced 
Coca-Cola's Salute to the Black Family. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at the Sheraton Grande Hotel members of the business community 
gathered at a cocktail reception honoring one single- and one dual-parent 
family that demonstrated unity and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Today you hear many things about our families being in trouble, and you hear a 
great deal about dope and gangs in the black family, but you don't hear about 
the positive side as much as you should," Boswell said. "What affects one 
family affects all families. If any of us don't keep our families together, 
whether we be black, white, yellow or brown, then our country cannot survive." 
</P>
<P>
Amid enthusiastic applause from the audience, Boswell added, "I wasn't doing 
that for any applause, gang. I was just talking the truth!" 
</P>
<P>
An 11-member selection committee, co-chaired by Dan Austin and Eugenia Scott, 
had selected the two families based on criteria which included stability, 
religious affiliation, accomplishments of the children, extending encouragement 
and direction to their children and to others, education, work history, 
community involvement, the ability to overcome odds and strong family values. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Reinhold and her children Angela, 16, and Kurt, 11, from Los Angeles, were 
honored as the outstanding single-parent family. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the midst of tragedy things can go on and you can still strive and 
make it," said Judy Reinhold, a medical technician, who lost her husband to 
cancer six years ago. "Being 100% behind your kids and motivating them is all 
you can ask. My main concern is keeping them right on track, and do what their 
father would have pushed them to do had he been there. And I attribute all the 
positives in my life to to love of the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting this award was the furthest thing from my mind. I go about my life not 
thinking anyone is cluing in to what I'm doing, that it's of no importance to 
anyone else. But something like this comes along and you say, 'I must really be 
doing OK. It's working.' We have to work as a chain and stick together. We have 
our ups and downs, but this is definitely an up." 
</P>
<P>
Daughter Angela, a junior at Immaculate Heart High School, said, "It's an honor 
for this to happen to us, and the work that we've done has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Added son Kurt, a student at Notre Dame Academy, "Sometimes we have bad times, 
but we get together afterwards and we're friends." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond and Maple Cornwell of Inglewood and their children Eric, 31; Mark, 28; 
and Craig, 22, were honored as the dual-parent family. (Eric, a surgeon, was 
not able to make it for the ceremony). 
</P>
<P>
Each had his own explanation for the family's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that education would probably be the backbone of the whole family," 
said Mark, a Los Angeles-based territory manager with American Express. "There 
was a lot of determination in regards to our endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
"I concur with Mark," said his mother, a public school district supervisor, 
"but I also think our foundation comes from the knowledge and love of God. I 
think another strong point is our extended families. Our parents were very 
strong people, and we just continue the process. And also there is 
adaptability, being able to adjust to different situations. Without that we 
would not have made it after the fire." 
</P>
<P>
She was referring to a fire 13 years ago that destroyed their home (it was 
rebuilt eight months later). "We actually had to start as if we were just 
married," she added, "but with three children." 
</P>
<P>
"Our way of life has to do with strong faith," said Raymond Cornwell, pastor at 
Faith Chapel Baptist Church. "Faith in God, in ourselves, in one another. That 
has been one of the main things that has kept us going. We've demonstrated it 
as a way of life, not just words. And no negative thoughts -- always positive." 
</P>
<P>
Added son Craig, a procedures analyst with McDonnell-Douglas, "I always knew my 
parents were there for me to fall back on. I always try to be independent, but 
I've seen friends of mine try to do some things that I've done (but) without 
parental love and support, and I see how hard it is." 
</P>
<P>
Both families spoke of the need for positive family role models. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all families have to be (depicted) as being in the ghetto and being in 
deep trouble," said Judy Reinhold. "I know of other families in similar 
situations to ours. You hear about all the negative things about black 
families, rather than the positive." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maple Cornwell, "It's not a mystery that we've made it, the mystery is 
that (few are aware) that it's happened to so many others. I feel we stand in 
for those folks who work hard."

'BACK TO THE FUTURE' -- FILMING IN DOUBLE TIME; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: TWO SEQUELS TO THE MEGAHIT THAT TOOK IN $358 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE 
ARE COMING TO THE PRESENT. THE FIRST OPENS THIS WEEK; THE SECOND IS SCHEDULED 
FOR SUMMER.

"Synchronize your watches," proclaims the massive billboard hovering over the 
Sunset Strip, keeping a vigil on the number of hours, minutes and seconds 
remaining until the release of "Back to the Future Part II," a follow-up to the 
top-grossing film of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Similar billboards have been counting down in Universal City and in New York 
City's Times Square. There is no name identification. Just the familiar image 
of Michael J. Fox, who, as the adolescent time traveler Marty McFly, helped 
sell $358 million worth of tickets worldwide for Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
A payoff like that begs for a sequel, and now, after a 4-year wait, Universal 
has not one but two sequels, shot back to back and scheduled for release within 
six months of each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the Future Part II," which takes Marty, his girlfriend Jennifer 
(Elisabeth Shue) and wild-eyed Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to the year 2015, 
opens Wednesday; "Back to the Future Part III," set mostly in the Old West, is 
set to surface at the beginning of next summer. The studio has yet to determine 
plans for the release of the sequels' videos. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for the two is about $80 million, which director Robert Zemeckis 
acknowledges is $10 million to $15 million less than if they'd been shot 
separately, but still more than twice the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing both at the same time was quite a risk," said Tom Pollock, president of 
Universal Pictures. "It was much more expensive initially . . . like laying out 
the money for four films at once." 
</P>
<P>
Zemeckis and co-producer/screenwriter Bob Gale, faced with a "floodgate of 
ideas," pitched the two-sequel idea to the studio last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed an audacious, insane proposal on the face of it," said Gale, "but it 
made sense economically and creatively. No sets had to be reassembled, no 
schedules coordinated three years down the line. And since Michael had to play 
a high school kid, waiting the few years it usually takes for a studio to mount 
a big special-effects movie would have been pushing the outside of the 
envelope." 
</P>
<P>
"Part II" begins where the original left off. "It's your kids, Marty. 
Something's gotta be done about your kids," warned Doc Brown -- and Marty and 
Jennifer, zooming off in the DeLorean time capsule, take his words to heart. 
What they encounter is neither Orwellian nor Lucas-like, but rather a 
humorously depressing picture of their middle-aged selves . . . and, later on, 
the specter of an "alternate 1985" in which greed and environmental neglect 
have run amok. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided there was no way we could predict the future accurately," Gale 
noted, "so we decided to have some fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
What surfaced was a true modern-day fantasy, a world in which the Cubs win the 
pennant and the justice system (devoid of lawyers) works well. Sight gags and 
inside jokes abound. "Surf Vietnam," reads one travel poster. Playing at the 
local theater is " 'Jaws 19,' directed by Max Spielberg." 
</P>
<P>
A trailer with highlights of "Part III" is tacked onto the end. "Depending on 
what happens with this one, it's either the world's most brilliant marketing 
ploy or the most audacious affront," said Fox, talking by phone from the 
Northern California set where "Part III" is still in production. "It could be 
perceived as presumptuous, but the last thing Bob Zemeckis wants is for people 
to think he phoned this one in. He's a great 'You ain't seen nothing yet' kind 
of guy." 
</P>
<P>
The two Bobs have collaborated ever since their days at USC Film School, 
sharing screenplay credit on three Zemeckis films -- "Used Cars," "I Wanna Hold 
Your Hand" and "Back to the Future" -- as well as on Steven Spielberg's "1941." 
"Bob G. is the thinker, the strategist," Fox explained. "Bob Z. is the doer, 
the one who takes the seeds that have been planted and reads even more into 
them than originally intended." 
</P>
<P>
Zemeckis said that doing a sequel was the furthest thing from his mind when he 
and Gale knocked out the first "Back to the Future" draft in 1981. The project, 
originally developed at Columbia, had been turned down by every major studio, 
and prospects for getting it to the big screen were dim. 
</P>
<P>
"It was before 'E.T.,' " said Gale, "and no one was sure there was a market for 
a 'sweet' film. Everyone told us to take it to Disney, which, in the 
pre-Eisner-and-Katzenberg days, wasn't up for a film about a romance between 
this kid and his mother." 
</P>
<P>
A month after his "Romancing the Stone" took off at the box office in 1984, 
Zemeckis' time-warp comedy got the green light from Universal. When the studio 
asked him to do the sequel, however, the director had second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I wanted to re-enter Back-to-the-Futureland," said Zemeckis, 
from the Jamestown, Calif., location. "But it became clear that the train was 
going to leave the station whether I was on it or not. Better to have some 
control and be faithful to the original, I figured, than to turn my back and 
walk away." 
</P>
<P>
But the train wouldn't go anywhere, he insisted, until he squeezed in at least 
one other project. That project turned out to be "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," the 
No. 1 film of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There was no master plan or grand design for the trilogy, he said, just a 
determination not to clone the original. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw this as a saga, along the lines of 'Godfather II' and the 'Star Wars' 
films," Zemeckis said. "The same characters, the same town seen through 
different times. The thought of going back into the first movie and shooting 
the same scenes from a different perspective excited us. My challenge as a film 
maker was to redefine this thing they call sequel." 
</P>
<P>
Zemeckis calls "Back to the Future II" his toughest shoot yet. The script calls 
for the actors to play several characters in the same shot, necessitating 
elaborate and precise camerawork. (In one scene, Fox plays three roles at once: 
Marty at 47 and his teen-age children -- one boy and one remarkably attractive 
girl). 
</P>
<P>
Shooting one film while in post-production on another also doubled the 
director's workload. In between shots of "Part III," he'd head for his mobile 
editing room to work on "Part II." During a recent stretch, Zemeckis shot one 
movie from 6 a.m. until sundown, then caught a plane to Burbank, where he did 
post-production work on the other until late into the night. He then checked 
into the Sheraton Universal, got up at 5 a.m and took the 50-minute flight back 
north. 
</P>
<P>
Though admitting to fatigue, he downplayed the commute: "Only 10 minutes longer 
than it takes me to get from Santa Monica to Burbank at rush hour. And I got to 
sleep on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Fox too had his hands full. For six weeks, while filming of "Future" II 
overlapped the taping of the final season of TV's "Family Ties," he worked days 
at Paramount playing Alex Keaton and nights (until 2 a.m.) at Universal playing 
Marty McFly. The birth of his son, Sam, in May compounded the intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the martyr I was five years ago when I juggled the two," he said. 
"Though I'm not known for throwing my weight around, when I'd get exhausted, 
I'd say, 'Go fire me.' If I'd tried that last time, I'd have lost both jobs. . 
. . The horrible thing is that we'll still be shooting when this one opens. If 
it bombs, I'll be there in Monument Valley, Utah, putting my hand to my head . 
. . 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts, for the most part, don't think he has much to worry about. 
"The film has a built-in audience, the concept is easily transferable to a 
sequel, and some of the competition has been pushed back," said Jeffrey 
Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. "People are keyed up and 
ready to go. It's the most anticipated film of the Christmas season." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, say Zemeckis and Universal executives, there will be no 
"Back to the Future Part IV." Entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom of Bloom, Dekom 
&amp; Hergott, has heard that one before. "They say they'll close with this 
script . . . but that's only until they need revenues. They know it and so does 
everyone else."

IS IT MIDNIGHT FOR DAWN STEEL AT COLUMBIA?; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIOS: MANY INDUSTRY INSIDERS ARE BETTING THAT COLUMBIA'S PRESIDENT WON'T 
REMAIN NOW THAT PETER GUBER AND JON PETERS ARE FINALLY IN CHARGE.

<P>
After two months of haggling with Warner Bros. over their exclusive production 
contract with that studio, producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters are finally 
free to take over Sony's newly purchased Columbia Pictures. And they're hitting 
the ground running. 
</P>
<P>
Already they've talked about the corporate jets they will order. Plans are in 
the works to build a gym and day-care center and to spruce up the executive 
offices at Columbia Pictures' new home at the former MGM lot in Culver City. 
Even before Warner officially released them from their contract last Thursday 
-- in a settlement that could eventually cost Sony as much as $500 million -- 
Guber and Peters had met with Columbia's production staff to review the 
studio's slate of movie projects. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the first orders of business remains on the table: staffing the 
studio's executive suites. Still to be determined is the fate of Columbia 
Pictures president Dawn Steel, who has been weighing her options since Sony 
first announced plans to purchase the studio for $3.4 billion in September. A 
decision is expected in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry insiders are betting that Steel won't remain at the studio, 
despite reports that Guber and Peters have invited her to stay. In an interview 
last week, Guber and Peters ducked the question of whether they wanted Steel to 
stay on as president of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been friends with Dawn Steel a long time," said Guber. "We would like 
to do whatever is the appropriate thing." Steel declined comment on her future 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Steel, as well as to Guber and Peters, say there has been 
discussion about the terms of her possible departure from Columbia. Steel still 
has about a year left on her employment agreement, so if she were asked to 
leave, her contract would have to be bought out. If she were to quit, Columbia 
wouldn't be obligated to pay her anything. If Steel does leave, informed 
sources expect her to do so with a financial settlement in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Steel has had a number of offers elsewhere in the industry, principally an 
independent production contract at Disney. There also have been rumors that 
Steel may take an independent production deal at Fox, where she is close to 
company chairman Barry Diller, or that she may make movies with her husband, 
producer Charles Roven ("Heart Like a Wheel"). Other rumors have Steel taking 
on executive positions at other studios. 
</P>
<P>
There still is no official word on which industry figures Guber and Peters will 
bring into the company. As Guber put it last week: "We've spent the last month 
and a half consumed with litigation" over the Warner contract. 
</P>
<P>
But industry sources point to Alan Levine, their longtime attorney at 
Armstrong, Hirsch &amp; Levine, as the principal candidate for chief operating 
officer. One source close to Levine said his move to Columbia "was a done 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
Levine's firm is an influential one in the entertainment industry and has close 
ties to Creative Artists Agency, which handles some of the biggest directors 
and stars in the business. If Levine does join Columbia, it is expected that he 
also will oversee much of the studio's TV production, since he is one of the 
most prominent legal names in television. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential candidate for a senior post at Columbia is Alan Rich, an 
executive at Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., which Sony bought for $200 million 
in order to obtain the services of its two co-chairmen. Guber told Daily 
Variety last week that their former company would remain as a standing entity 
inside Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
However the impending management changes at Columbia turn out, they will cut 
short Steel's two-year tenure at the helm of the studio, making it difficult to 
assess her success. She spent much of her energy during that time finishing up 
the 33 movies left behind by her iconoclastic predecessor, David Puttnam. 
</P>
<P>
While one of those, "The Last Emperor," walked away with a best-picture Academy 
Award, and a few Puttnam films did respectable business at the box office, most 
of them came and went without much audience or critical attention. Industry 
observers attribute some of that failure to the limited theatrical release 
Columbia gave many of these films, as well as their quality. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the Puttnam films, "Time of the Gypsies," which earned a best 
director award for Emir Kusturica at the Cannes Film Festival last spring, will 
be released in February. Filmed in a Gypsy language called Romany, this is 
believed to be the first film in history to require subtitles in every theater 
it plays around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Steel's efforts also were set back by the five-month-long writers' strike last 
year. But some of her critics say that, despite these obstacles, Steel should 
have moved faster to put films into production. Some industry sources speculate 
that she was hemmed in by the budget-conscious managers above her -- former 
chief executive Victor Kaufman and chief operating officer Lewis Korman -- who 
were eyeing a potential sale of the studio. (Both executives resigned after the 
Sony purchase.) 
</P>
<P>
Steel's first major films appeared this past summer -- "Ghostbusters II" and 
"Karate Kid III." "Ghostbusters" did an impressive $110 million in ticket sales 
but was considered a disappointment for the studio, which had hoped for grosses 
closer to the $220 million that the first film did four years earlier. "Karate 
III's" box-office performance, while a respectable $39 million, was also 
considered disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both films helped re-establish Columbia's presence with 
exhibitors and helped boost the company's market share to 15.9% so far this 
year from about 9% at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That market share also has been helped by the surprise success of a Tri-Star 
release, "Look Who's Talking," the baby-talk comedy produced by MCEG 
Productions that so far has grossed more than $75 million. (Tri-Star was folded 
into Columbia Pictures earlier this year, and Steel wasn't involved in the 
development of its current releases.) 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's market position also was aided by the recent box-office success of 
"When Harry Met Sally," which the studio released under its distribution 
agreement with Castle Rock Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
One of Steel's pet projects at Columbia was "Casualties of War," a big-budget 
Vietnam drama starring Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox that the studio released in 
August. Although the film drew some impressive reviews, its $17 million in 
ticket sales fell far short of its $22.5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
The studio continues to hold high hopes for at least four other films 
spearheaded by Steel -- "Revenge," a Ray Stark production starring Kevin 
Costner; "Postcards From the Edge," based on Carrie Fisher's novel and directed 
by Mike Nichols, with Meryl Streep starring; "Flatliners," a drama about 
Harvard medical students starring Kiefer Sutherland and Julia Roberts, and 
"Awakenings," a Penny Marshall-directed drama starring Robert De Niro and Robin 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Guber and Peters will inherit these projects, as well as about 16 Tri-Star 
films already scheduled for or in release, including "Steel Magnolias," 
"Glory," "Family Business," "Music Box," "Mountains of the Moon," "Blind Fury" 
and "Loose Cannons." 
</P>
<P>
They also will inherit an exclusive production agreement with Michael Douglas, 
as well as non-exclusive deals with a dozen artists and film makers that Steel 
brought onto the Columbia lot, including actors Sally Field, Cher, Madonna, 
Glenn Close and Jane Fonda.

96 RACE BIAS CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED SINCE COURT'S JUNE RULING ON RIGHTS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court decision last June that sharply restricted the reach of a 
major civil rights law has resulted in the dismissal of 96 race discrimination 
claims, nearly one every business day since the opinion was issued, a study 
released Sunday by a civil rights group says. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reviewed court actions between 
June 15, the date of the Supreme Court's decision in Patterson vs. McLean 
Credit Union, and Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Judges, acting on their own or at the request of those being sued, dismissed 96 
discrimination claims in 50 cases as a result of the Patterson decision, the 
study by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People found. 
</P>
<P>
In Patterson, the court said an 1866 civil rights law that prohibits race 
discrimination in the making of a contract -- known as section 1981 -- "extends 
only to the formation of a contract but not to problems that may arise later 
from the conditions of continuing employment." 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Defense Fund study found that 31 claims of racial discrimination in 
firing were dismissed as a result of the decision and 22 claims of racial 
harassment were thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, judges cited Patterson in dismissing 16 claims alleging that 
promotions or transfers were denied on the basis of race, eight retaliation 
claims and six demotion claims. 
</P>
<P>
Seven complaints that did not involve employment discrimination were dismissed 
along with six miscellaneous complaints involving the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The study pointed to a case involving an industrial nurse whose supervisor 
repeatedly made explicit racial and sexual remarks to her, and on two occasions 
showed her pictures of interracial sexual acts and told her she had been hired 
to perform them. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's claim alleging that the harassment violated section 1981 was thrown 
out by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, which concluded that 
her claim did not relate to "conduct which impairs the right to enforce 
contract obligations" and therefore had to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the court majority in Patterson said section 1981 had to be narrowly 
interpreted to avoid overlapping with Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 
the study found that a "significant number" of claims dismissed in light of 
Patterson could not be brought under Title VII because they did not involve job 
discrimination, which is all that Title VII covers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he could not comment 
specifically on the report because a copy had not been provided to the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that "a conclusion that these (cases) somehow show some 
diminishment of equal opportunity or commitment to civil rights could be 
misleading" since many cases would be covered under Title VII and others could 
be "resolved at state and local human relations commissions or in other laws 
which bar discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Justice Department also has been monitoring cases to determine the 
effect of the Supreme Court decision. "The review to date in general terms . . 
. indicates that there is nothing that has occurred in the lower courts which 
would lead the department to see a need for any major rewriting of the 
country's civil rights law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Schnapper, the author of the NAACP study, said: "If the Justice Department 
said they've been reviewing a lot of decisions and they found no evidence that 
Patterson has any impact, I don't question the veracity of that comment. It 
seems to confirm our concern that the Justice Department isn't reading American 
court decisions any more but may be reading decisions from the Transvaal."

A dispute over the existence of an official South African death squad gathered 
momentum when a third policeman alleged that the squad killed anti-apartheid 
leaders between 1980 and 1982. The Johannesburg Sunday Times said former police 
constable David Tshikalange, a black man, admitted in an interview that he 
helped kill black civil rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981. Tshikalange's 
claims supported charges by former police Capt. Johannes Coetzee, who left the 
country after telling the liberal Afrikaans-language weekly Vrye Weekblad that 
he headed an official police death squad.

For every 100 births in the Soviet Union, there are 106 abortions, a medical 
newspaper said. Soviet abortions in 1988 totaled nearly 7 million, 
Meditsinskaya Gazeta reported. "These monstrous statistics are difficult to 
believe," it said, adding that illegal abortions performed outside hospitals 
are not even counted in that total. The weekly Moscow News reported in January 
that 90% of all first pregnancies in the Soviet Union end in abortion and that 
hundreds of women die each year as a result.

A ballot proposal to establish an autonomous Muslim region with limited 
self-rule in the southern Philippines appeared headed for defeat. Early results 
in 13 provinces and nine cities indicated a strong rejection of the referendum. 
Full results are not expected for several days. A low voter turnout was 
reported, prompting a claim of victory by the Muslim separatist Moro National 
Liberation Front, which had urged a boycott of the balloting. Defeat would mark 
the first election setback for Corazon Aquino's government since it came to 
power in 1986. It would dim chances of settling a Muslim separatist revolt that 
has long divided the south, where more than 5 million Christians form a 
majority over 3.5 million Muslims.

Holding paper crosses bearing the names of six Jesuit priests murdered this 
week in San Salvador, about 700 people marched to MacArthur Park for a rally to 
protest the U.S. government's financial involvement in El Salvador's escalating 
civil war. The high turnout for the mile-long march was fueled by concern after 
a week of intense guerrilla warfare in El Salvador culminated in the murders of 
the priests in the capital city, said organizers who have frequently held 
rallies that have drawn fewer people. "I haven't come out for a long time to 
protest," said painter Antonio Bernal. "But things have gotten so bad that we 
have to do as much as we can to stop the killings."

LAPD ASKS UNION TALKS ON RANDOM DRUG TESTING; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: LEAGUE MEMBERS TO BE POLLED BEFORE MANDATORY POLICY THAT WOULD 
INCLUDE TOP BRASS IS ACCEPTED. PRESIDENT DOESN'T OPPOSE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department may soon get what its chief has been seeking 
for the last several years -- mandatory random drug testing for all sworn 
police officers, including top brass. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest bid to implement such a policy, the department has submitted a 
formal proposal to begin discussions on the issue with the city's largest 
police union, whose leader said this week that he does not oppose such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. George Aliano, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said, 
however, that he wants any testing policy to be negotiated between the 
department and the union to ensure adequate controls. The union, he said, must 
first poll its 7,800 members to see if they would oppose opening negotiations 
on their contract with the city, more than two years before it expires. If the 
policy is immediately implemented, officials said, the LAPD will be the first 
major California police department and one of only a handful in the nation to 
have mandatory random testing of all officers. 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said he suspects that Los Angeles police officers will support the 
testing in the union poll, which he expects to be conducted over the next six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to show that they are drug-free just like everybody else," he said. 
But "if my members felt strongly against reopening the contract, then I would 
resist" the immediate implementation of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how the LAPD will proceed if resistance is mounted. But Cmdr. 
William Booth, a department spokesman, said it "would not change" the goal of 
Chief Daryl F. Gates and other police officials to put the policy in place. He 
said, however, that the department wants to comply with state labor laws that 
require police management to "meet and confer" in good faith with the union 
before making significant changes in its members' work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials became more confident that their proposed policy could 
withstand legal challenge after the U.S. Supreme Court last Monday declined to 
hear a union challenge to the Boston Police Department's 3-year-old mandatory 
random testing program. 
</P>
<P>
"We said hallelujah" after hearing the news of the Supreme Court's action on 
Monday, Booth said, "but our program and meet-and-confer action have been 
moving in that direction for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said he received the department's latest proposal two weeks ago. Chief 
Gates, however, has been pushing for mandatory drug testing for at least three 
years. He has spoken out on the issue in editorials, speeches and in trade 
magazines, arguing that citizens should have the assurance that the people who 
respond to them in emergencies are drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Booth said, 10 LAPD officers, including two new hires who were still 
on probation, either were fired or resigned because of drug-connected 
administrative actions leveled against them. Aliano said his union has been 
hesitant to endorse a random drug-testing policy in Los Angeles in the past 
because the legality of such a policy had not been resolved by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Detta Roberts, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
said the Supreme Court ruling will prompt a review of that department's policy, 
which presently does not require random drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the new developments," Roberts said, "we are giving the issue new 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Although some officials believe that the Supreme Court's ruling in the Boston 
case has resolved the issue, others noted that the justices did not comment 
directly on the program's constitutionality and could agree to hear a challenge 
in a future case. Under existing policy, the only LAPD officers who can be 
forced to undergo random testing are new hires during their first 18 months of 
employment. Officers who are strongly suspected of drug use can be required to 
take a test. If they refuse, they can be administratively charged with 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Such policies as well as voluntary testing programs are typical of law 
enforcement agencies in California and throughout the nation, observers say, 
but that might change significantly in light of the Boston case. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McDermott, legal counsel for the Boston Police Department said last 
Thursday that since the Supreme Court's action, queries about the Boston 
program have poured in to him from departments around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Al Cooper, a lobbyist for the Sacramento-based California Peace Officers Assn., 
said random drug testing for police officers has recently been gaining support 
among the general public and in the courts and may be the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see quite a bit of it because the officers themselves want to 
show people that they are drug-free," Cooper said.

Sizzling 90-degree heat caused by a Santa Ana condition was at least partly to 
blame for a 15-acre brush fire in Sylmar that started from spontaneous 
combustion, when an 8-foot-deep compost heap erupted in flames. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 200 acres of brushland were blackened in San Dimas and the 
adjacent Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Inspector John Lenihan said four 12-year-old boys 
"playing army and throwing smoke bombs" accidentally started the San Dimas 
fire, which was contained late Sunday by 150 firefighters from 15 engine 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Near Riverside, about 100 firefighters battled a blaze that had blackened more 
than 300 acres in the Pedley area, forcing evacuation of a wildlife reserve 
Sunday night, said Mike Wilson, a state Department of Forestry spokesman. The 
fire was reported about 10:30 a.m. at Bain Street and Limonite Avenue and 
spread along the Santa Ana River bottom in tall trees and thick brush, Wilson 
said. There was no estimate of when the blaze would be contained. 
</P>
<P>
Calm seas and balmy weather created perfect scuba diving conditions, 
authorities said, but one diver narrowly escaped death Sunday after his 
seemingly lifeless body was pulled from the Pacific by fellow divers near Santa 
Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Peter Troedsson said the victim was revived by an Air 
Force surgeon and Coast Guard flight mechanic using cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, or CPR. The victim, 48, whose name was not released, was 
airlifted to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, where he 
underwent recompression treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those mishaps, the crystal-clear skies -- seemingly absent of most smog 
-- drew rave reviews and even inspired a bit of the poet in some. 
</P>
<P>
"We can almost see the mist rising from Mauna Kea. . . . That's the volcano on 
the big island of Hawaii," said Lew Kuykendall, operations coordinator at Los 
Angeles International Airport. "This is the kind of perfect day when 
photographers come out to take the pictures for post cards. I'm thinking about 
taking the rest of the day off sick." 
</P>
<P>
"There's unlimited visibility, no wind at all. You can see Catalina Island 
perfectly and it's almost completely glassy out here," said Bill Powers, senior 
lifeguard at Santa Monica Pier. "We have an awful lot of folks at the beach and 
in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, said a high pressure area was creating an offshore flow, forcing 
warm air from Nevada and the deserts into the Southland and out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
That, combined with another high pressure system in the upper atmosphere, 
helped drive the Civic Center temperature to 90 degrees. Dittmann said the 
record for the date is 92, set in 1895. 
</P>
<P>
It was warmer elsewhere, with Montebello and San Gabriel recording highs of 92; 
Santa Ana reached 91. 
</P>
<P>
With a forecast of more perfect weather today -- and only slightly cooler 
temperatures -- Los Angeles was preparing to offer up a pleasant week for 
out-of-town visitors arriving for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"This weather will make everybody who doesn't live here feel pretty bad," said 
county Lifeguard Lt. Wally Millican at Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the forecast also prompted warnings from fire officials, who said that hot 
temperatures, dry ground and parched brush made firefighting difficult Sunday 
and may spell even more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Capt. Jack Rumfola said brushy areas throughout the county "are 
substantially drier this year than they have been in the past" -- and that 
campers and vacationers heading into outlying areas for the long holiday 
weekend should exercise special caution.

A QUASAR OUT ON THE EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have discovered the most distant object seen so far in the universe, 
a quasar that is about 14 billion light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
Using the Palomar Observatory in northern San Diego County, scientists from 
Caltech, Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton 
detected the quasar in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major just below 
the bowl of the Big Dipper. 
</P>
<P>
Quasars are the most luminous objects in the universe, shining with a 
brilliance greater than a thousand galaxies, but the recently discovered quasar 
is so far away it is 400,000 times too faint to be seen by the unaided eye. The 
discovery, announced in the December issue of the Astronomical Journal, was 
made by Donald P. Schneider of the Institute for Advanced Study, Maarten 
Schmidt of Caltech and James E. Gunn of Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Quasars are "quasi-stellar objects" and most astronomers believe they are 
powered by a "black hole," an object so dense and its gravity is so powerful 
that even light cannot escape. As the black hole gobbles up matter within its 
gravitational reach, the material emits brilliant light just before 
disappearing into the black hole, according to the prevailing theory. 
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered quasar is so far away that it must have been created when 
the universe itself was quite young -- possibly only a billion years after the 
Big Bang.

'HUMOR THERAPY' FAILS TO LIVE UP TO ITS BILLING IN TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB STEINBD Stein is a science writer for United Press International.

<P>
If you laugh, the whole world may laugh with you -- but it probably won't do 
much for your health, a study released recently suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who laughed at an old Jack Benny routine felt no better than those who 
listened to soothing ocean sounds during their operations, researchers 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Some anecdotal reports and laboratory studies with healthy populations suggest 
humor may be of therapeutic benefit to hospitalized patients," wrote Joseph 
Neumann, a psychologist at the Quillen-Dishner College of Medicine in Johnson 
City, Tenn. "The present report suggests the helpful effects of humor in 
hospitalized patients may be less than previously indicated." 
</P>
<P>
The study, published as a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
involved eight men who underwent prostate surgery and 16 men who underwent a 
procedure to test arteries in their legs. 
</P>
<P>
Half the patients listened to a one-hour tape of "an old Jack Benny radio 
show," while the other half listened to a one-hour tape of ocean sounds while 
undergoing their procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five per cent of those who listened to the Jack Benny tape "described 
the tape as humorous," Neumann said. 
</P>
<P>
Neumann compared the two groups of patients using a variety of variables, 
including heart rates and anxiety and pain levels before, during and after the 
surgery. He found "no statistically significant group differences." 
</P>
<P>
"Caution is urged in advocating extensive resources for 'humor therapy.' While 
the therapy probably does not hurt, this as well as other controlled studies 
cast doubt on the efficacy of humor or music tape approaches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Further controlled research is needed to find out if humor therapy works and, 
if it does, with what patients and under what conditions," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was titled, "Humor Therapy: The Good News -- No One Died; The Bad 
News -- Jack Benny Did." 
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying letter, Beth and Philip Henneman of the UCLA Medical Center 
described a study aimed at demonstrating that "a smile is contagious." 
</P>
<P>
Of 300 hospital workers in the study, 87% of those who the researchers smiled 
at, smiled back, the Hennemans said. Only 8% of those who received eye contact 
without smiles smiled back, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly, 60% of the subjects in the experimental group (those who were 
smiled at) offered a 'hi' or other salutation in addition to smiling," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This research supports the theory that a smile begets a smile. Implementation 
of this technique has the potential to increase socialization and decrease 
stress in large, impersonal medical centers," they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly recommended that this study be replicated at other institutions, 
not only with staff, but with patients and families as well," they said.

POT-BELLIED SMOKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smokers appear to be prone to pot bellies. A new study shows that while men and 
women who smoke tend to weigh less than nonsmokers, they are more likely to 
carry their weight in unsightly places -- around their abdomens. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people, especially women, smoke, in part, to stay thin. This suggests 
that smokers may be thin, yes, but gorgeous? Maybe not," said Dr. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Connor of the UC San Diego School of Medicine, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one more piece of information about the notion that smoking is bad 
for you," Barrett-Connor said. "Most people don't want pot bellies." 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies showed smokers tend to be thinner than nonsmokers and that 
smokers tend to gain weight when they quit. Surveys show that many smokers 
avoid quitting for fear of gaining weight. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found smokers are more 
likely than nonsmokers to accumulate fat as "abdominal paunchiness" and the 
tendency appeared to increase with the number of cigarettes smoked for both 
sexes, Barrett-Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers are not sure why smoking would influence body fat 
distribution, studies suggest smoking may affect hormones that can influence 
body shape, she said.

TWO EDITORS SEE THEIR NEWSLETTER AS JUST THE TICKET FOR TIME TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Hicks wants to travel back in time and get to know the father who deserted 
him when he was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Darrow Baker has a longer journey in mind -- back 4 billion years to 
the Precambrian Age, before life on Earth began. 
</P>
<P>
While many believe time travel is out of this world, neither Hicks nor Baker 
are waiting passively for scientists to come up with a device capable of 
bursting through the time barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two San Fernando Valley residents are doing their part by 
publishing a slick, bimonthly newsletter called Travels in Time in hopes that 
it will spur a major breakthrough in time travel. Although they also have hope 
that the publication will eventually make a profit, both men acknowledge that 
they are unlikely to see a return on their $10,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a labor of love -- this magazine is for the hundreds and thousands of 
people who think of time travel not as fiction, but as a real possibility," 
said Hicks, 42, a computer systems manager at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone on the East Coast -- New York for instance, could read something we 
print that someone on the West Coast has thought of, and the whole puzzle of 
time travel could be solved," said Baker, 30, who worked as a technical writer 
before establishing his own barter company. 
</P>
<P>
But even science fiction buffs, many of whom believe in the power of dreams to 
foster technological advances, are skeptical about the prospects of time 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule it out entirely, but let's just say I'm not ready to buy my 
ticket," said Lydia Marano, who owns Dangerous Visions, a science fiction and 
fantasy bookshop in Sherman Oaks. Marano is one of several bookstore owners in 
Los Angeles who are carrying free promotional copies of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Hicks are not fazed by such skepticism. They say they are on a quest 
to unravel the mystery of time, and to prove it, they have spent about $10,000 
so far to publish their newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Time travel is the most important topic around," Hicks maintains. "Just look 
at all the movies and TV shows and books written about it." 
</P>
<P>
But since the first issue was published in August, only about 200 people have 
bought subscriptions, which sell for $17.50 and include a T-shirt imprinted 
"Time Traveler" and a plastic membership card identifying the holder as willing 
to hop on a time machine, should one be invented in their lifetime. Astronomer 
Carl Sagan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and TV personality, is a 
subscriber, but Hicks and Baker are sending him the newsletter for free. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Pelz, a librarian at UCLA's engineering library and a science fiction 
historian, said "Travels in Time" is one of about 350 "fanzines" published 
monthly in the United States. He describes fanzines as magazines published by 
one who is fanatical about some aspect of science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
But Pelz said Hicks and Baker's fanzine is unusual because they pay to have it 
printed, rather than typing it up on a home computer or typewriter and then 
photocopying it. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, the younger and more effusive of the two, said he was fascinated by time 
travel even as a small boy. Sitting in a trendy restaurant near Universal 
Studios, Baker broke into song upon request, dredging up from memory ditties 
from defunct TV shows such as "It's About Time." Patrons looked up from their 
pizzas when Baker trilled, "It's about time, it's about space, it's about 
people from a different place. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yet both men say their venture generally has been greeted with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Oh, how original,' but I think they mean it tongue in cheek," Hicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, on a day Baker and Hicks hope will be entered in the annals of time 
travel history, they were jogging in Griffith Park. They were talking about 
their favorite subject -- the possibility of traveling backward or forward in 
time -- when Baker proposed putting out a newsletter on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
Time has whirled by since, as the two novices set out to master the art of 
publishing, including how to send things at bulk mail rates. (All you need do 
is send 100 identical pieces to qualify, Baker said.) 
</P>
<P>
The six-page newsletter is printed on glossy paper sprinkled with time motifs 
such as drawings of clocks and hourglasses. There are articles on the physics 
of time travel, short stories, editorials and reviews of movies and TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he may run a classified ad in mainstream newspapers in hopes of 
finding people who have been in comas for long periods of time. He believes 
they would make interesting subjects to interview for the newsletter because 
"they are time travelers who have stepped out of the normal flow of time." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the ultimate time traveler would be someone who was frozen and awoke 
in the future, Baker and Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Then why are they personally more interested in traveling back, rather than 
forward, in time? 
</P>
<P>
"It's human nature to think, 'what if I had done that differently' -- to erase 
your regrets," Hicks said.

Carolyn Cunningham takes charge of the new Antelope Valley Child Abuse Center 
amid indications of the severity of the child abuse problem in the Antelope 
Valley: 
</P>
<P>
* A Lake Los Angeles man was charged with murder last week in the beating death 
of his 4-year-old stepdaughter, whose mother was charged with child abuse for 
allegedly leaving the girl in his care despite the girl's pleas that her mother 
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services has approved the 
addition of seven sorely needed positions to bring its overworked Lancaster 
staff up to 39 workers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
* And a play about incest titled "Shattered Secrets" ran in Lancaster last 
weekend to educate residents and child welfare professionals about the grim 
legacy that sexually abused children carry into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a 38-year-old clinical psychologist and former director of the 
child sexual abuse program of the Glendale Family Service Agency, says the 
privately funded center will represent a dramatic step forward in treatment and 
prevention of child abuse. She will begin hiring staff soon in hopes of opening 
to the public in December. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful opportunity," she said. "I'm impressed by the concept. 
Ideally, we will be focusing on the whole family. . . . The idea in the long 
range is not just to treat kids who have been abused but to prevent abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was selected from about 20 applicants by the center's board, a group 
of doctors, business people and local leaders who raised $300,000 over the last 
year to start the center. 
</P>
<P>
The group reacted to statistics from the county, law enforcement agencies and 
schools showing child abuse is proportionately higher in the valley than in 
many urban, more densely populated communities. Experts attribute those numbers 
to the isolation of the high desert, the pressures on its many young 
working-class families and a willingness to report suspected abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"People who abuse tend to isolate themselves," Cunningham said. "But abuse is 
more obvious in isolated communities." 
</P>
<P>
The board chose Cunningham because of her well-rounded background, said 
Palmdale psychiatrist John Beck, head of the selection committee. Cunningham 
has written two books on the subject and is a former Conejo Valley teacher and 
supervisor of a program for child offenders at Children's Institute 
International in Los Angeles. She lives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's initial task will be to provide a setting in which the people who 
deal with child abuse -- prosecutors, child-welfare workers, sheriff's deputies 
and doctors -- can combine efforts. That will benefit the victims because they 
can be interviewed and examined in one place at one time, Cunningham said, 
citing similar programs at the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center in Palm 
Springs and the Stewart House in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Jean McAndless, who supervises the county Children's Services office in 
Lancaster, said: "It will be a resource for us. . . . It's so much trauma for 
the child. All the different agencies will be able to make use of it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the shutdown of a small child abuse program at Antelope Valley Hospital 
Medical Center this summer, McAndless said, county workers have had to take 
some victims to hospitals as far as Harbor City for physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
The center will provide parenting classes, therapy for victims and their 
families, and education about the legal system, Cunningham said. She also plans 
to set up a hot line for families experiencing stress. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's field is inherently tragic and unpleasant, but she said there are 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"Adult offenders are victims who start abusing at 8, 9, 10 years old," she 
said. "If you can stop them at that age, you can stop them. . . . When you work 
with little kids, you can see a lot of progress. You see good results."

U.S. COMPLIES WITH CALL FOR IMPACT STUDIES ON ARTS PARK; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE SIERRA CLUB SUED TO BLOCK THE CULTURAL CENTER PROJECT LAST 
YEAR. IT IS URGING ALTERNATIVE SITES OUTSIDE THE SEPULVEDA BASIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sierra Club and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have taken a significant 
step toward settling their legal struggle over Arts Park L.A., a proposed 
cultural center that could be built in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club filed suit in federal court last year seeking to block Arts 
Park, claiming that the project was proceeding without required environmental 
impact reports. According to the Corps of Engineers, those studies are under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps owns the basin and has agreed in principle to let a private group -- 
the Cultural Foundation -- build Arts Park on a 60-acre plot there. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and community groups have argued that the basin is the 
Valley's last substantial patch of greenery and a habitat for migrating Canada 
geese. They want Arts Park's theater, museum and other structures built outside 
the basin, along Ventura Boulevard or in a similar urban setting. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact reports requested by the Sierra Club are of particular 
importance to Arts Park opponents because they would identify and evaluate 
alternative sites for the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The key issue in the lawsuit is that we believe the Cultural Foundation must 
do an environmental impact report," said Barry Fisher, the Sierra Club's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are actually going to do that, then they have acceded to our request," 
Fisher said. "It's a shame it took a lawsuit to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
Arts Park, as it is envisioned, could lure world-class symphony orchestras and 
ballet troupes to the Valley, say the car dealers, bankers and civic leaders 
who make up the Cultural Foundation and who have been working at their quest 
for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
The complex would include a wing-shaped museum and clusters of colorful 
workshops set among rolling hills. At the center of the Arts Park would be a 
theater, partially subterranean but jutting above ground in a splay of grids, 
fins and elevated walkways. 
</P>
<P>
These plans could change as a result of the government studies -- a state 
environmental impact report and federal environmental impact statement -- that 
analyze everything from the biological effects of construction to the resulting 
traffic increases in surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"As they go through the environmental process," said Sheila Murphy, a Corps of 
Engineers project manager, "they might find that certain aspects of certain 
facilities will be unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the impact reports could require that particular structures, or all 
of the complex, be built elsewhere in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state law allows some leeway as to when such reports for a project 
must be submitted, as long as they are submitted before approval for 
construction. The Sierra Club wanted the reports done years ago. The foundation 
said it could not begin an environmental impact report (EIR) until completion 
of its recent design competition, which produced architectural models of each 
of Arts Park's structures. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do an EIR until you know what you're going to put on it," said Linda 
Kinnee, the foundation's executive director. "It was frustrating for us because 
they didn't have to sue anybody to get this report done." 
</P>
<P>
The final reports should be issued within two years and the U.S. attorney's 
office, which is representing the Corps of Engineers, is confident the Sierra 
Club suit will be settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
However, another legal issue may prolong the case. It involves the manner in 
which environmental documents are prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers is responsible for studying the impact of any 
construction on its land. But by common practice it asks the developer to 
handle the research for its report. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in this case, the Cultural Foundation has hired an Orange County firm 
that specializes in preparing environmental reports and statements. This firm, 
the Chambers Group, will study Arts Park's environmental impact and present its 
findings to the Corps of Engineers, which uses the information to fashion a 
final draft of the impact report. 
</P>
<P>
This partnership between government and developer is considered standard 
practice. Fisher and the Sierra Club say they consider it a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal agency has an obligation to do an independent analysis," Fisher 
said. "One has to question how balanced and deep the analysis will be when it 
is the very proponent of a particular site and a particular design that has 
been delegated the responsibility of doing that analysis." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chambers Group argued that impact statements have to be 
balanced because much of the report process is open to the public. Hearings are 
called to allow the community to voice concerns and suggestions. First drafts 
of the documents are later presented for public comment and revision. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that this report is so intensively reviewed by the 
government and by the people that we have to be sure it's an impartial 
analysis," said John Westermeier, a vice president of the Chambers Group. 
</P>
<P>
The first public hearing could be held as early as January, Westermeier said. 
Others would follow in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the Sierra Club, having won its request for evaluation 
of alternative sites, will drop its case against Arts Park or will use the suit 
to challenge the government-developer relationship in the impact report 
process. And, should the complex eventually be approved for construction in the 
basin, the Sierra Club might seek other avenues to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
The next hearing in the case will be held in U.S. District Court on Jan. 8.

VACCINE SEEN SUREST WAY TO AVOID MISERY OF FLU SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
INFLUENZA: OLDER AMERICANS CAN ESCAPE THE ILLNESS AND ITS SOMETIMES DEADLY 
COMPLICATIONS WITH A SIMPLE PREVENTIVE MEASURE. AND NOVEMBER IS THE BEST TIME 
TO GET THE SHOT.

<P>
The old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" holds true for 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Each winter millions of Americans suffer the fever, aches and pains of 
influenza. Most recover from the effects in a week or so, but for many older 
people the flu and its complications are extremely serious. 
</P>
<P>
While the body's immune system is busy fighting the flu, a person is less able 
to resist pneumonia, another life-threatening infection. Older people and those 
with chronic diseases such as heart disease, emphysema, asthma and diabetes 
have the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
And older people are more likely to require hospitalization. Flu and pneumonia 
combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and 80% to 
90% of the deaths are in people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be prevented by 
vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks before the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Flu 
travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded indoor places like malls, 
grocery stores, theaters and hospitals. When someone with the flu coughs or 
sneezes, droplets containing particles of the virus spread to others. 
</P>
<P>
After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days; the disease 
continues to be contagious for another three to four days. 
</P>
<P>
Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a variety of 
well-known complaints, including chills and fever, headache, runny nose, sore 
throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness and muscle aches and pains often last 
for several days. If the virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing homes and 
other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also, health professionals, 
nursing home workers and family members who live with someone older than 65 
should get a flu shot to avoid spreading the disease to those at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time. Because 
different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each season, a new vaccine is 
prepared every year. It contains strains of the flu virus recently circulating 
worldwide and believed likely to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such 
as the "Spanish flu" and "Hong Kong flu" refer to places where large outbreaks 
of new flu strains have first appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses. Because the flu shot 
does not contain infectious viruses, it does not cause the flu. The most common 
side effect is a sore arm, which occurs in less than one-third of those 
vaccinated and usually lasts only a day or so. A few people also may develop a 
brief low-grade fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12 
hours after vaccination and can persist for one or two days. 
</P>
<P>
If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses (such as one 
tablet every three to four hours) usually will relieve these symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after influenza 
vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to grow the virus for the 
vaccine, should not receive the vaccine, as some egg protein may be present. 
</P>
<P>
Because the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time to be 
vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available against the most common 
types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. The flu shot can be given at the same 
time as the pneumonia vaccine without increasing the side effects. The flu shot 
must be given every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug -- amantadine -- can prevent 
infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for people who have not had 
the vaccine or as extra protection for those who have been immunized. 
</P>
<P>
When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine reduces the duration 
of fever and other symptoms. It also can prevent infection if taken during the 
entire four- to six-week course of a flu epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to the virus again. 
It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping, impaired concentration and 
dizziness, and has been associated with falls in older people. As with all 
medication, patients should take it only with a doctor's recommendation.

L.A. WATER RATE HIKE DECISION DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in recent memory, the Los Angeles City Council has balked at 
a water rate increase requested by the Department of Water and Power, delaying 
a decision on the politically touchy matter until January. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, the council members find themselves in the uncomfortable 
predicament of having to choose between the apparently intractable positions of 
warring city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of the controversy is an unusual public squabble between the 
powerful DWP, which says a 6.5% revenue increase is essential, and the more 
obscure city administrative office, whose financial analysts insist that the 
DWP is actually operating at a huge surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pleadings of some council members who want the agencies to work 
things out quietly -- as they always have in the past -- the sides, at least 
for the moment, refuse to budge." 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen such open one-upmanship between two offices," said 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. "Somehow a feud developed that stopped 
conversation between the two." 
</P>
<P>
For the council members, half of whom face reelection in 1991, the situation 
could develop into a political disaster. Without unassailable evidence that a 
rate hike is necessary, few council members want to vote for it. But they have 
been warned by DWP that, if they turn down the increase now, they may find 
themselves voting for a double-digit rate hike next year, precariously close to 
election time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in voting for a double-digit rate increase," said 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who faces reelection in 1991. "It makes more sense 
to do it now when the amount is smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre called the controversy a "turf fight" and said, "Until now they've at 
least agreed on what the increase would be." 
</P>
<P>
The administrative office "thinks Water and Power is sitting fat," Alatorre 
said, adding that he thinks DWP has performed "fairly well" over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say they are not sure precisely why the issue erupted now after 
years of peace. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the administrative office say the process got off to a bad 
start this summer when the DWP failed to send its rate-increase request to the 
mayor's office in time for the administrative office to analyze it. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the agencies come to an agreement before a proposal is sent to the 
Water and Power Commission. Instead, the proposal went to the commission with 
no input from the administrative office. Lacking any other information, the 
commission approved the DWP request. 
</P>
<P>
But, by the time the matter got to the City Council in October, Keith Comrie, 
the city's chief administrative officer, had taken a hard look at the data 
offered by DWP and came up with a dramatically different conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We just did our normal analysis," Comrie said. "They finished last year with a 
$47-million excess cash balance. . . . We were not in a position to recommend 
an increase." 
</P>
<P>
The initial report from Comrie's office predicted a $30-million surplus by the 
end of the current fiscal year. That figure has since been increased to nearly 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the DWP proposal, water rates would increase an average of 6.5% for the 
rest of the fiscal year. The monthly bill for the average homeowner, who uses 
1,800 cubic feet of water, would increase from $21.26 to $22.51, a 5.9% jump. 
Other customers, such as publicly owned grounds, municipally sponsored 
agriculture and street and drainage facilities, would face higher increases, 
bringing the average to 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
If the increase had taken effect in October, it would have brought the DWP an 
additional $19 million in revenue.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESTAURANT FIRE CAUSES $40,000 DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that started in a deep-fat fryer forced the evacuation of a Thousand 
Oaks restaurant and caused $40,000 in damage, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County fire dispatcher Vicki Crabtree said the blaze, which did not 
cause any injuries, was reported about 7:30 p.m. Saturday in the kitchen of the 
El Torito restaurant at 449 N. Moorpark Road. It was brought under control 
about half an hour later by 36 firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic fire extinguisher in a heat hood over the fryer was activated but 
was unable to put out the blaze, which spread to the rest of the kitchen, 
Crabtree said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 61 ARRESTED IN PACOIMA PROSTITUTION STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-one men were arrested during a weekend sweep for allegedly soliciting 
prostitutes in Pacoima, Los Angeles police reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The men were taken into custody after approaching three female officers posing 
as prostitutes on San Fernando Road between Van Nuys Boulevard and Osborne 
Street from noon to midnight Saturday, said Sgt. Ken Dionne. 
</P>
<P>
The men were either jailed at the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Division or cited and released pending a court appearance, Dionne said. He said 
the sweep was launched after vice officers noticed an increase in prostitution 
in the area. Forty prostitutes have been arrested on San Fernando Road in the 
past three weeks, police said.

KILLEA TACTIC CAN ONLY HURT THE CHURCH IN THE LONG RUN; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: PUBLIC OFFICIALS TAKE AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, NOT THE 
VATICAN. THEY SHOULD REPRESENT ALL VOTERS, NOT JUST CATHOLICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA HILLS and CAROL SOBEL, Linda Hills is executive director of the 
American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties. Carol Sobel 
is a staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church will hold the feet of Catholic politicians to the 
fire, warned a congregation of some 300 bishops meeting in Baltimore earlier 
this month. If those elected officials fail to vote against abortion in any 
form, many of the bishops said, they may risk excommunication. 
</P>
<P>
Now Lucy Killea, a Catholic legislator and an openly pro-choice candidate for 
state Senate, has been barred by Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego from 
receiving Communion until she recants her position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The church will probably be unsuccessful in its efforts to force Killea or most 
other Catholic elected officials to vote the church doctrine on abortion. But 
even if the church is able to dictate the blind allegiance of some legislators 
with these tactics, in the long run it can only lose. 
</P>
<P>
Every public opinion poll taken on the question of abortion shows that a 
majority of Catholics support the right of a woman to choose a safe, legal 
abortion. In 1972, just a year before the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision 
in Roe vs. Wade, a Gallup Poll showed that 57% of Catholics favored legal 
abortion. By 1980, Gallup reported that this number had increased to nearly 77% 
of American Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Polls continue to show overwhelming Catholic support for this fundamental 
right, despite increased public opposition of the church. And this is not 
simply a theoretical expression of American pluralistic values. Those same 
polls show that, when faced with this decision in their own lives, a majority 
of Catholic women chose abortion to end an unwanted pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the church is still not the state and it can decide who its members 
will be and what they must avow publicly to remain in good standing. The bishop 
of San Diego and other members of the Catholic hierarchy are entitled to their 
deeply held faith and the vigorous expression of their moral stance on 
abortion. They are not automatically excluded from the public debate on this 
issue simply by virtue of their position in the church. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they cannot compel their orthodox religious view of abortion 
to be adopted by the politicians, who then may exert the power of their office 
to impose the church's view on everyone else. If others are to accept the 
Catholic view in making their personal decisions on abortion, it must be by 
force of reason, not force of law. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the bishop seems to have forgotten the lesson of our Constitution and 
the lesson of history. Every public official takes an oath to uphold the 
Constitution, not the Vatican. They are elected to represent all of the voters 
in their districts, not just the Catholic voters. 
</P>
<P>
This demand by the church hierarchy for undivided loyalty can only return us to 
a dark age of religious intolerance when many individuals were denied the 
opportunities to be full members of our society because of their faiths. 
</P>
<P>
At the formation of our nation, Virginia still prohibited "papists" from 
holding public office. Georgia's Constitution of 1777 limited participation in 
its legislature to Protestants. New York effectively prohibited Catholics from 
elected office by requiring naturalized citizens to "abjure foreign allegiance 
and subjection in all matters ecclesiastical and civil." 
</P>
<P>
During the summer of 1787, as the nation struggled to write a Constitution, 
Charles Pinckney, a Constitutional Convention delegate from South Carolina, 
proposed the radical concept that no person be barred from holding public 
office on account of his religion. The North Carolina delegates expressed 
vehement opposition to the notion of eliminating religion as the litmus test 
for public office. They, like others, were afraid that atheists, pagans and 
even Roman Catholics might assume power. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these arguments, delegate James Iredell, who was later appointed 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, asked how men of any faith could be excluded from 
our political life without destroying the very principle of religious liberty 
for which our nation stood. 
</P>
<P>
The voice of reason prevailed, and the delegates adopted Article VI, barring 
any religious test for public office. In its place we now require that 
government officials "shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the spoken fear has remained for centuries that the doctrinaire views of 
Catholicism would make a member of this faith follow the dictates of the church 
and not the Constitution. A Catholic politician's allegiance would be with 
Rome, not Washington, breeding more religious strife. 
</P>
<P>
In large part because of these fears, no Roman Catholic was ever elected 
President until 1960, and few were even seriously considered before that time. 
It was not so long ago that many in this nation wondered aloud if John F. 
Kennedy would follow the Constitution or the Vatican in matters of state. 
</P>
<P>
We are a nation conceived in a struggle for liberty of conscience. Many of us 
trace our ancestors to movements seeking sanctuary from the religious 
intolerance suffered by minority faiths throughout history. Recognizing the 
tyranny inherent in a religious state, we made the solemn promise, through our 
Constitution and Bill of Rights, that each of us would be free to decide 
matters of faith for ourselves without government compulsion or impediments. 
</P>
<P>
Now we face the most serious national division along religious lines in 
decades. The action of Bishop Maher raises the question once again of who 
governs in a democracy: the people or the church. The Roman Catholic Church has 
told its members that on the issue of abortion they must choose between faith 
and public obligations at the risk of moral peril. That choice can only take us 
back to a time of religious intolerance and distrust that betrays the American 
spirit.

RAMS NO LAMBS IN VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSE HAS FIVE SACKS, FOUR INTERCEPTIONS IN 37-14 WIN OVER THE 
CARDINALS.

Two weeks removed from pro football's rock pile, the Rams have wiped away the 
effects of four lost weekends and taken on the league with open scowls and 
dropped gloves. They cleaned out Phoenix, 37-14, on Sunday with little regard 
for the Cardinals' overall physical condition, which remains code blue. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, a team held together by adhesive tape and a Health Maintenance 
Organization, weren't up for a fight at Anaheim Stadium, but the Rams weren't 
buying sad stories. They have so many of their own to share. 
</P>
<P>
This game was as no-nonsense as the Rams get. They pinned the Cardinals down 
early on Michael Stewart's 41-yard interception return for a touchdown less 
than two minutes into the game and never let up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a clean strike, efficient and bloodless. Quarterback Jim Everett 
completed 15 passes for 308 yards and two touchdowns, an average of 20.5 yards 
per completion. Two went to Henry Ellard, who had touchdown receptions of 49 
yards in the first quarter and 42 yards in the fourth and 163 yards in five 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback-tailback Robert Delpino continued his headfirst drive to notoriety, 
scoring his first rushing touchdown on a 32-yard sprawl-and-dive over the 
end-zone pylon in the second quarter and accounting for 134 all-purpose yards 
(rushing-receiving-kick returns). 
</P>
<P>
Delpino is close to making the Rams think he was the only running back they 
drafted in 1988, although Gaston Green did suit up Sunday to gain nine mop-up 
yards in three mop-up carries. 
</P>
<P>
And suddenly the Ram defense doesn't look so bad, sacking three Phoenix 
quarterbacks five times and intercepting them four times. The secondary had 
just six interceptions in 10 previous games. 
</P>
<P>
They Rams have nine sacks in their past two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were so tired of their recent fate that common sense sometimes escaped 
them, most notably when Everett -- nicknamed "Blade" for his slight build -- 
gave Cardinals' defensive end Freddie Joe Nunn (6-4, 260, forearms that 
resemble anvils) a stern in-your-face lecture late in the third quarter after 
Nunn rode Everett out of bounds on a scramble. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing was that Nunn just stood there and took it, explaining later 
that he didn't need a manslaughter charge on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no match," Nunn said. "Why waste my time? I might get a penalty. 
Actually, I kind of enjoyed it. It pumped me up. I was hoping the refs would 
pull a flag on him. But it's real hard to take from a quarterback. Real hard. 
What surprised me was that I took it." 
</P>
<P>
Everett was relieved that Nunn had more control over his emotions than he did 
in the situation. You know how easy it is to break a quarterback in two? 
</P>
<P>
"I carried it as far as I ever want to carry it," Everett said. "You might call 
me a third-degree idiot." 
</P>
<P>
Everett thought he was out of bounds when Nunn struck, although it didn't 
appear that close on the replay and no penalty was called. Everett was 
determined to get his point across, though, whatever risks to life and limb. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him what a nice, cheap hit that was and how much I liked him at 
that particular time of my life," Everett said. "It's heated out there, you're 
going 100 m.p.h.. I don't particularly like it, but it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, realizing later the logic of his outburst, apologized to Nunn after 
the game, but he refused to apologize for his style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to do anything to endanger the team," he said. "But I will 
offer my opinion if I think it's wrong. . .I put myself in a position where the 
guy wants to kill me the rest of the game. That's probably not a good deal. But 
he wants to kill me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In one cathartic, throat-clearing outburst, the Rams' quarterback unloaded a 
few things from his chest, screaming on behalf of his team, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Rams coach John Robinson could only stand back and admire his team's leader in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"If they'd have gone to blows, he'd have been swinging," Robinson said. "I love 
that about him. I like the attitude." 
</P>
<P>
What's not to like? The Rams were leading, 27-7, at the time, and his starting 
quarterback was fighting for every yard. Robinson's defense, an eye-sore 
through a four-game losing spell, first swallowed up Cardinals' starting 
quarterback, Gary Hogeboom, who tossed two interceptions, and then dug into his 
replacement, Tom Tupa, who was intercepted once and sacked three times, twice 
on successive plays in the fourth quarter by linebacker Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's left cornerback, Jerry Gray, had his best game in recent memory with 
two interceptions, setting up a touchdown and field goal. More important, he 
soothed some painful memories of earlier drops against Buffalo and Minnesota, 
picks that might have prevented two crippling, last-minute losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I felt I let the team down," Gray said. "I think I was feeling it 
the most, because I had the chance to make some plays and I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's wide receiver, Ellard, continued his assault on opposing secondaries 
and the Ram record book, moving past Tom Fears into third place on the team's 
all-time yardage list. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard, on ability alone, turned two medium range passes into long touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He made those touchdowns," Everett said. "Both of them." 
</P>
<P>
After the second, a 42-yarder in the fourth quarter to put the Rams up 37-7, 
Ellard re-introduced his dangerous, end-zone celebrating front-somersault, the 
same one that put him in hot water with the head coach last season. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Robinson was only critical of the landing, which he said was flawed, 
in one judge's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"And that gets you down from a 9.5 to an 8.6," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what to do with this Delpino, the fifth-rounder who's crowding two-first 
rounders, Green and Cleveland Gary, out of the picture? 
</P>
<P>
On Delpino's 32-yard scoring run, he burst out of the backfield like a bullet, 
cutting off right tackle Jackie Slater's block before blowing full speed down 
the sidelines, the run ending a face-first dive to the flag. The moment was 
only dulled by instant replay, which served to delay, then uphold, what seemed 
a certain score. 
</P>
<P>
"That really made me mad," said Delpino, who had rehearsed his spike and 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino finished with 68 yards, averaging 6.18 yards per carry. This is his 
third season as a running back, having been converted from receiver as a senior 
at Missouri, proving it with three catches and 46 yards on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino wonders how good he'll be once he learns the position. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys have been runners all their lives," he said. "I do have a lot to 
learn about the position." 
</P>
<P>
The salary structure, for one. But the Rams' $90,000 man continues to put 
serious heat on a backfield loaded with millionaires, one from UCLA in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will put more pressure on him (Robinson) to run me more with the 
ball," Delpino said. 
</P>
<P>
As quick as a Delpino run, the Rams find themselves back in a divisional race. 
The Rams, ever mindful of their rivals, San Francisco, had the luxury of 
scoreboard watching in the fourth-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, relieved from duty by Mark Herrmann, monitored the Packers' slim 
fourth-quarter lead from the sideline, and prepared himself for another heroic 
Joe Montana comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers' win was finally made official by the Rams' public address 
announcer with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"With him," Everett said of Montana, "You wait for the announcer." 
</P>
<P>
Two games back with five to go. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron Brown caught his first pass of the season with 12:37 remaining Sunday, a 
12-yarder from quarterback Jim Everett. Brown had another 20-yard reception 
with 10:43 left. . .Rams' defensive end Doug Reed sprained his left ankle in 
the first half and did not return. It probably will force Reed out of next 
week's game in New Orleans . . . Linebacker George Bethune suffered a 
concussion. There were no other serious Ram injuries . . . Mike Lansford kicked 
three more field goals Sunday and has now made 17 of 20 attempts for the season 
. . .

RAIDERS HUMBLED AS THEY STUMBLE THEIR WAY TO 5-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders drew a line in the dirt and staked their future on it, starting 
their gimpy No. 1 quarterback, making a bodyguard of their fullback and giving 
the ball solely to their Bo to see what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't quite live up to their hopes. 
</P>
<P>
They were on AstroTurf, in the House of Pain. The Oilers rolled a convoy over 
their line that seemed to take all Sunday afternoon to pass, 419 yards of 
offense against a once-proud defense, and squashed the Raiders, 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing really to say," said Howie Long, disconsolately and succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got our butts kicked." 
</P>
<P>
All the way to 5-6. They're two games behind the 7-4 wild-card contenders 
Houston and Miami, one behind 6-5 Cincinnati. Color them endangered. 
</P>
<P>
And, to add injury to insult, Bo Jackson left in the third period with a twinge 
in his left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the same type of twinge last year when we played the Saints in New 
Orleans," he said. "And then the next play, I tore my hamstring. So we just 
played it safe." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
How badly do the Raiders thirst for the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise, they started Steve Beuerlein, who has suggested recently he 
might be the bright, young quarterback they've searched half a decade for. 
Beuerlein has a partially torn ligament in his right knee. The game was on 
unforgiving artificial turf, against an unforgiving defense. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Beuerlein went back into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Did Art Shell think they were running any risk? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Shell said. "You run a risk any time you play anyone out there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beuerlein: "I don't want any focus on that at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there was concern coming in. The decision wasn't made until late in 
the week. It was something people weren't sure about. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not why we lost the ball game. That's not why I didn't get the ball 
in the end zone. Bottom line is, we just got out-played. I felt like I could 
get it done out there and I didn't do my job very well. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea (what percent he was). I really have no idea. The knee is not 
where it needs to be. It's not anywhere near 100%. But the bottom line is, I 
was out there playing. If I'm going to play, I've got to get the job done. With 
or without the bad knee." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein was neither savior nor goat. He had the Raiders within 10-7, in good 
field position (Raider 41) in the closing seconds of the first half, when he 
threw one over the middle to Mervyn Fernandez. Fernandez got both hands on it, 
but tipped it into the air behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Tracey Eaton caught it, ran 13 yards and lateraled to Jeff Donaldson, 
who went another 14 to the Raider 36. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Warren Moon found Leonard Harris when the Raider defense 
couldn't. He was all alone in the end zone and Moon threw him an 11-yard 
touchdown pass to make it 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' Timmy Ware then fumbled the second half kickoff. Before you could 
say, "Wait 'til next year," Tony Zendejas had kicked a 20-yard field goal and 
it was 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
Down 20-7, the Raiders had to start throwing. Jackson, who had rushed for 36 
yards in the first quarter, and 50 by halftime, got only two more carries and 
four more yards and finished with his low of the season -- 54 yards, a 4.9 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"He averaged five yards a crack -- sub-par for Bo," said ex-Raider Sean Jones, 
ironically, while the Houston press tried to get him to say how they'd stopped 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in averaging 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo ran with authority. They say he's not tough. The only people who talk that 
. . . don't play. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time he ran the ball, for 13 yards? I counted 59,000 people staring. 
I never saw a guy like that. Every time he touched the ball, people go, 'Ahhhh 
. . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
"How did we do it? Our offense. 
</P>
<P>
"You hand the ball to your offense and they hold the ball seven minutes. They 
score. Now it's goodby Ground Bo, they've got to go to Air Beuerlein." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders never got inside the Houston 40 after that, not that they had that 
many chances. The Oilers had the ball for 9:32 in the third period, for 11:32 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Houston had the ball 39:48 to the Raiders' 20:12. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers out-gained them, 419-243. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, before the Oilers started running under wraps, it was 
250-96. 
</P>
<P>
In his first five weeks, Shell continually praised his team for working hard, 
adding in difficult moments at Philadelphia and San Diego that it could hold 
its head up. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he dispensed with all that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally out-played by a real good football team," Shell said. "We 
didn't do anything offensively, we didn't do anything defensively, or on 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They just totally out-classed us." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the TV lights went off and Shell climbed down from the podium. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother said there'd be days like this," he murmured. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gordon McCarter's officiating crew made their point by ejecting Oiler bomb 
squadder Eugene Seale when a fight broke out on the opening kickoff, and the 
game between these two famed intimidators was relatively clean. . . . The 
Oilers took only eight penalties for 49 yards. The Raiders were called for 12 
for 119, including two more holds on Rory Graves. . . . Bo Jackson's low total 
before Sunday's 54 was 79 yards, at Philadelphia. His low average was also 
against the Eagles -- 4.4. . . . Raider fullback Steve Smith was kept back to 
protect Steve Beuerlein, and didn't carry the ball until the last two minutes 
of the third period. It was his only one. . . . Raider punter Jeff Gossett, cut 
by the Oilers last season, had a big day in his return to the Astrodome: a 42.3 
average, with no return yardage for a 42.3 net average. . . . Vince Evans, who 
hadn't played since the 1987 strike games, went the last series, which started 
at the Raider 4 with 1:52 left. Evans stumbled running onto the field, but on 
his first play, threw a 40-yard completion to Willie Gault. Feel good to be 
back? "Yes sir, buddy," said Evans, smiling. "It looked the same. The guys were 
still out there growling, talking jive.". . . Raider nose tackle Bob Golic was 
knocked woozy, although he returned. "They say I wasn't unconscious," he said, 
"but I don't remember coming off the field."

CALIGIURI'S GOAL PROPELS U.S. TO WORLD CUP, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it seemed as if the United States had to beat an entire island Sunday, that 
was not the case. It had to beat two islands, Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
But against a better than decent T&amp;T soccer team, and in front of more than 
35,000 fans, all dressed in red, who had the National Stadium bulging at its 
seams, the United States scored an unlikely victory. The fact that it scored at 
all was unlikely enough. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had been shut out in its last two games, but midfielder Paul 
Caligiuri, a former UCLA captain from Diamond Bar, broke the team's 238-minute 
scoring drought in the 30th minute of a tense 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
This game was an example of what international soccer is all about, if not at 
its best then at least at its most thrilling. The victory assures that the 
United States will be exposed to more of it next summer, when it goes to Italy 
to play alongside the national teams from 23 other countries in its first World 
Cup finals since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to determine all of the implications for soccer in the United 
States, but it at least should help to generate interest in the World Cup that 
will be held there for the first time in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a dream any more," said goalkeeper Tony Meola, who became the starter 
four games ago and has had shutouts in all of them. "We're in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
The dream is truly over for Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean islands that, 
with a population of 1.2 million, would have become the smallest country ever 
to qualify for the World Cup finals if it had just played to a draw. 
</P>
<P>
"We Goin'," signs throughout the capital city of Port of Spain predicted. So 
confident were the islanders that there were advertisements on the scoreboard 
during the game for bargain travel packages to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The government announced last week that, win, lose or draw, today would be a 
national holiday. If the activity throughout the city Sunday night is any 
indication, it will not be a day of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
The game was televised live on both islands and was shown on Diamond Division 
screens at three locations on Trinidad. But there was still a rush on the 
stadium Sunday morning, although all 30,000 tickets had been sold within two 
hours when they went on sale two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
When the gates opened at 10 a.m., the ticket takers were not able to handle all 
of the fans, some of whom had been at the stadium since 4 a.m. Some people 
without tickets were able to squeeze through undetected, which resulted in a 
crowd that overflowed into the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) 
declared this a high-risk game because of all that was on the line and demanded 
extra security, there were no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. goal, the crowd was subdued for the remaining 60 minutes. When 
the final whistle blew, the fans remained in their seats, stunned into almost 
total silence. But when the U.S. players gathered at the sideline to 
acknowledge their supporters, about 130, the entire crowd applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, someone in the crowd shouted, "We want the Strike Squad," using 
the nickname for the T&amp;T team, which had already retired to the dressing 
room. Soon, everyone joined in the chant. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, thousands of people were still dancing in the streets to calypso 
music. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it appears as if the T&amp;T team, which has no more experience 
than the United States at playing important international soccer games, 
succumbed to the pressure of all the pregame hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were with them in the tunnel before the game, they were scared," said 
U.S. sweeper Mike Windischmann. "You could tell by looking at their eyes. They 
didn't want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Although T&amp;T had only to tie to advance, it didn't have the type players to 
go into a defensive shell and hope for a draw. The United States planned to 
play tight defense early, hope that T&amp;T would be too overeager on offense 
and make a mistake that would leave its backside open to a counter-attack. 
</P>
<P>
But all of that changed in the 30th minute, when Caligiuri scored from 30 yards 
out. He was about to shoot with his right foot but flicked the ball over to his 
left when a defender closed on him. He then volleyed the ball, curving it 
deftly into a upper right-hand corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
That is the kind of skill that allowed Caligiuri to play three years in West 
Germany. But because he has not always been available due to his commitments 
there and because of a fractured bone in his now-famous left foot when he did 
return to the United States this year, he has not been a regular with the 
national team. He started for the first time in a World Cup qualifying game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that he had at least one left-footed shot still in him," said U.S. 
Coach Bob Gansler, who has been taking the heat because of his team's inability 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
With a 1-0 lead, the United States was able to do what it does best, play 
defense. In eight World Cup qualifying matches this year, it scored only six 
goals. But it was able to advance out of the Central and North American region 
(CONCACAF) because it allowed only four. 
</P>
<P>
The United States finished the five-nation round-robin tournament with a 4-1-3 
record. T&amp;T was 3-2-3. Costa Rica also advanced with a 5-2-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the second half was played in the U.S. end as T&amp;T mounted 
charge after charge, but it had only three real scoring chances against a 
physical, swarming defense. 
</P>
<P>
There was not a modern scoreboard clock to give the exact time remaining, which 
added to the tension. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the second half lasted two hours," defender Brian Bliss said. 
"At one point, I was thinking there was only about 10 minutes left. When 
someone on the bench called out 23 minutes, I couldn't believe it. I thought it 
was never going to end." 
</P>
<P>
But when it did, it was the United States, not T&amp;T, that was checking into 
those travel packages to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost, the sun would have risen tomorrow," Gansler said. "But now it 
will shine a lot brighter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

The first thing to establish about Bo Jackson is, there really is one. And only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
He's a real person and not a character made up by Burt L. Standish or Ralph 
Henry Barbour or even Horatio Alger. He's not a person out of a dime novel like 
Frank Merriwell or Tom Swift or one of the Rover Boys. He's not out of the 
comic books. He doesn't wear a mask or a block S. Still, you're surprised he 
needs a plane. You expect, from what you hear and read, he will just come 
leaping over tall buildings. It's a bird, it's a man -- it's Super Bo! 
</P>
<P>
He's the second coming of Jim Thorpe, the world's greatest athlete. At least. 
</P>
<P>
There he is, hitting these tremendous Ruthian home runs in All-Star games, 
running 90 or so yards in a football games. 
</P>
<P>
When's he going to win the heavyweight championship of the world? Give him a 
racquet, will he win Wimbledon? 
</P>
<P>
He transcends his sport, the way nobody ever did. Thorpe? Couldn't hit the 
curve ball. Jackie Robinson? Well, a case could be made. 
</P>
<P>
Football isn't even his main interest. Just something to do while waiting for 
spring training. He's football's Galloping Guest, a legend before his own time. 
</P>
<P>
The team is just kind of an afterthought when Bo Jackson comes to town. Bo and 
the Ten Dwarfs. The hotel lobbies are jammed with people hoping not to see the 
Los Angeles Raiders but to get a glimpse of Bo Jackson. The hero of the 
elevators is the kid who got Bo on his Polaroid camera. He'll probably frame it 
and put a light on it. He probably thinks it should hang in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
It's like a John Wayne movie, a Caruso opera. The rest of the cast is 
unimportant. You would have thought this week Bo Jackson was playing the 
Houston Oilers. He was bringing his own band with him. 
</P>
<P>
The Astrodome was festooned with banners saluting the appearance of the artist, 
Bo Jackson. "Bo Knows" signs were hanging off every level. "Show Bo What Bad 
Boys Know," they would read. "Bo Now Knows Pain." You felt like saying, "Who 
are those guys in the funny helmets with you, Bo?" You felt you should add, "If 
you know." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders coming to Houston is a game. Bo coming to Houston is an event. As 
the team bus rolled through the streets on the way to the field, the crowds 
shouted for Bo. No one knew who the supporting cast was. I mean, who played 
center field with Babe Ruth? Did Bernhardt have a co-star? 
</P>
<P>
The local papers were full of Bo stories. And photos. Bo hitting a home run in 
the All-Star game. Will Bo be baseball's MVP? Will he gain a thousand yards 
against Houston? 
</P>
<P>
How about 54? How about fewer yards than the uncelebrated Houston halfback, 
Mike Rozier? How about a couple of runs where he didn't get back to the line of 
scrimmage? What kind of an afternoon is this for a guy who's supposed to be the 
whole Four Horsemen by himself? A guy who's in more commercials than a dancing 
beer can? 
</P>
<P>
They gave the ball to Bo only twice in the second half. He netted two yards. 
Hang that in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they couldn't hand the ball to him much. They didn't have it much. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bo needs the football. He got it 11 times in the Astrodome Sunday -- 9 in 
the first half. He got it back to the line of scrimmage most of the time. But 
not always. Before the game, Houston's defensive end Sean Jones allowed, "What 
you have to do with Bo is make sure he doesn't go 80 yards on third-and-one." 
</P>
<P>
Sean needn't have worried. Bo went 14 on third-and-one once. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bo wasn't the only Heisman trophy winner on the field. Rozier picked 
one up, too, in 1983. There wasn't a single banner devoted to Rozier but he 
picked up five more net yards than Super Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the game belonged to a guy no one ever accused of being the world's 
greatest athlete. Or even the world's greatest quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Warren Moon was so little thought of when he played in high school in 
L.A., he had to go clear to Seattle to get in a college backfield. Then he had 
to go clear to Edmonton to get a job in the pros. That's OK if you're a moose. 
But a quarterback would rather be closer to the TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Warren completed 20 out of 30 passes Sunday for two touchdowns and 249 yards. 
The Moon shots were far more damaging and decisive than any of Bo's arrows. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. Bo is a star. The crowds lined up to jeer him as he left the 
field. The press was crowded around his cubicle as he dashed into the sanctuary 
of the trainer's room after the game. He finally came to rest after a half-hour 
or so attending to his bath, his toothbrush and a little attention to what he 
identified as a twinge in his quad (quadricep muscle in the left leg). It was 
reassuring to know Bo bleeds and feels pain like ordinary mortals. 
</P>
<P>
His press conference was typically terse and muted. Bo is as hard to hear as he 
is to tackle. Were the Houston Oilers "keying" on him, someone wanted to know? 
("Keying" is a football term denoting a rival player assigned to follow your 
every move, trail you wherever you go, whatever you do, to be sure you don't 
get to do much.) 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't think so. He thought Houston just played good sound defensive 
football. "Houston didn't allow me to do some of the things other teams do." Bo 
was not surprised to find himself the center of attention. Like the gunfighter 
in the old West who comes into town with the big reputation, you have to expect 
a certain amount of pot shots. 
</P>
<P>
Was it his lowest total effective yardage in years? Bo didn't know about that. 
Bo just looks for holes, not records. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were glad Houston won but you sensed a disappointment. It's rather 
like the time Thorpe played in a game against Knute Rockne and Rockne kept 
tackling him at the line of scrimmage. And Thorpe kept saying, "Son, these 
folks came to see old Jim run." Finally, he took dead aim on Rockne and knocked 
him into unconsciousness and ran the length of the field to score. He came 
back, helped Rockne to his feet and said, "Now, that's better. You let old Jim 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Bo may have to teach the league a lesson, too. They keep spoiling his road 
appearances. I mean, who wants Caruso drowned out by the lousy chorus?

NEW ORLEANS: PINT-SIZED BACK SHOWS GALLONS OF TALENT, GETS 158 YARDS AND A

Dalton Hilliard's size isn't the only thing deceptive about him. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask his teammate, New Orleans quarterback Bobby Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
"'He's not little, he's short," Hebert said. "Our nickname for him is 'Little 
Rock' because he's solid as a rock. He's just short in stature, not in playing 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard, a 5-foot-8, 204-pound running back, ran for a career-high 158 yards 
and one touchdown in 29 carries as the New Orleans Saints overcame four 
turnovers and beat the Atlanta Falcons, 26-17, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Buford Jordan's fourth-quarter touchdowns on runs of two and one yards erased a 
17-12 deficit and gave the Saints (6-5) their fifth victory in six games and 
their sixth consecutive win over Atlanta (3-8). 
</P>
<P>
"Hilliard is a tremendous running back," Falcon linebacker Tim Green said. "He 
cuts it back as good as anyone in the league. "It was discouraging to see him 
keep chalking up yards on you. It wears down your defense when they can run 
that successfully." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, trailed, 10-3, at halftime but went to their running game in the 
second half. Hilliard made the strategy work, gaining 71 yards in eight carries 
on a 75-yard drive that ended with his 22-yard touchdown run to tie the score, 
10-10, early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He always does great against us," Atlanta Coach Marion Campbell said of 
Hilliard, who had 127 yards against the Falcons last season, his previous 
career best. 
</P>
<P>
"He was darting and weaving in there and we just couldn't get him down," 
Campbell said. "He carried the load for them today." 
</P>
<P>
Not three minutes after Hilliard's touchdown, the Saints broke the tie, taking 
a 12-10 lead when Brian Forde broke through the middle and blocked Scott 
Fulhage's punt out of the end zone for a safety.

</P>
<P>
PITTSBURGH: A 91-YARD TOUCHDOWN DRIVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER HELPS END SAN 
DIEGO'S TWO-GAME WINNING STREAK, 20-17.

<P>
The San Diego Chargers were just getting pretty good at this business of 
winning as underdogs -- at least until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They knew, as did their last two opponents -- Philadelphia and the Raiders -- 
that their talent was inferior, but they used it as incentive to score two 
consecutive upsets. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers finally found a team they knew they could beat on Sunday, even 
though the Pittsburgh Steelers were slight favorites at Three Rivers Stadium. 
The Steelers' offense was the worst in the league and the Charger defense had 
played as well as any in the NFL the last eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of celebrating their third consecutive win, the Chargers were left 
wondering just what went wrong in a 20-17 loss. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Chargers had 20 first downs to Pittsburgh's 14 and outgained the 
Steelers, 359 yards to 151. 
</P>
<P>
They lost because they gave the ball away twice on botched punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
And they lost because quarterback Jim McMahon, who completed 19 of 36 passes 
for 226 yards, threw an interception right into the hands of Pittsburgh 
linebacker David Little in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by three and driving for what the Chargers figured would be the 
winning touchdown, McMahon called an audible. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers countered, and Charger Coach Dan Henning said McMahon probably 
never saw Little at the Steeler 36-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (4-7) also lost because they allowed Rod Woodson to race 84 yards 
for a touchdown on a kickoff return that gave Pittsburgh (5-6) a 13-10 lead 
midway through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also may have lost in part because of the scathing remarks Charger 
rookie defensive end Burt Grossman directed at almost everybody ever connected 
with the Steeler organization before to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it fired this team up," said Steeler tackle Tom Ricketts, a former 
college teammate of Grossman's at Pitt. "I know the team took it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
But loss can be directly attributed to the Steelers' 91-yard touchdown drive on 
12 plays in the middle of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With the Steelers trailing, 17-13, quarterback Bubby Brister completed a 
19-yard pass to Louis Lipps. Running back Merril Hoge broke loose up the middle 
for 31 yards, the longest run of his three-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
Then Brister, who finished with 12 completions in 27 attempts for 142 yards, 
threw to tight end Mike Mularkey for a 22-yard gain . 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Pittsburgh had first-and-10 at the Charger 12. Six more plays and one 
first down later the Steelers were staring at a fourth-and-one. They called 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned to the field they inserted wide receiver Rodney Carter and 
lined up in a split back set. Their aim was to make the Chargers believe 
Brister would roll out. 
</P>
<P>
And they succeeded. Hoge scored easily on a one-yard trap play and the Chargers 
had lost to a team they could have beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took a 17-13 lead late in the third quarter when McMahon threw 19 
yards to Anthony Miller for a score.

LOWERY, CHIEFS FIT TO BE TIED, 10-10

Nick Lowery rarely misses, but he doesn't often kick on the sloppy turf in 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, one of the most accurate kickers in history, missed two long field 
goals in the final four seconds of regulation and another with three seconds 
left in overtime Sunday as the Kansas City Chiefs and the Cleveland Browns 
played to a 10-10 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough stadium to kick in," Lowery said. "The last kick in overtime 
was like trying to kick out of a sand trap." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Stadium has a grass field that take nearly a year-round beating from 
football and baseball, so the footing is rarely good. 
</P>
<P>
Any moisture makes it a mess. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sandy in places and muddy in other places," said Cleveland's Matt Bahr, 
who made a 40-yarder in the first half. "You've even got turf seams. You never 
know what you're going to get when you go out there. Other kickers have empathy 
for me, that I have to kick on this field all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who began the year as the NFL's second-most accurate kicker behind New 
Orleans' Morten Andersen, tied the game with a line-drive, 41-yard field goal 
with 3:48 left in regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
He was wide right on a 45-yarder with four seconds left in regulation, but an 
offside call against Cleveland (7-3-1) gave him a second chance from 39 yards. 
That one was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's 47-yard try with three seconds left in overtime was short. 
</P>
<P>
The game lived up to its billing as a grudge match between the Browns and their 
former coach, Marty Schottenheimer, head coach of the Chiefs (4-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland put Kansas City quarterback Steve Pelluer out of the game with a 
sprained knee in the first quarter. The Browns held Christian Okoye, the NFL's 
leading rusher, to 40 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Metcalf scored on a one-yard run to give Cleveland a 10-7 lead in the 
third quarter after Chiefs scored on the second play of the second half when 
Neil Smith ran Mike Oliphant's fumble three yards to score.

PATRIOTS: NEW ENGLAND SCORES 20 POINTS IN LAST EIGHT MINUTES OF 33-24 VICTORY.

<P>
The New England Patriots have had plenty of practice coming from behind. For 
once, they got it right. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie cornerback Maurice Hurst put the Patriots ahead to stay on a 16-yard 
interception return with 2:49 left as New England scored 20 points in the last 
eight minutes Sunday to beat the Buffalo Bills, 33-24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably our largest play of the year," Hurst said. "I thought first 
about catching it and then when I saw the end zone I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots turned two mistakes by Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly into the 
decisive points. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's touchdown on a pass by Kelly gave the Patriots (4-7) a 30-24 lead and 
Jason Staurovsky added a clinching 38-yard field goal after New England 
recovered a fumble by Kelly at the Patriot 31. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo (7-4) fell into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Patriots overcame a 24-12 fourth-quarter deficit to take a 
26-24 lead over the New York Jets, only to lose, 27-26, on Pat Leahy's 
final-play field goal. A week ago, they nearly erased a 28-10 deficit with two 
touchdowns in the last four minutes but lost to New Orleans, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We know any time we play them we're in a fight," Kelly said. "We know they can 
come back. We know what kind of a quarterback Steve Grogan is." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly completed 21 of 41 passes for 356 yards, one touchdown and two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After Buffalo took a 24-13 lead on Larry Kinnebrew's one-yard touchdown run and 
Thurman Thomas' 25-yard scoring pass from Kelly, Grogan began the comeback with 
a 14-yard touchdown pass to Hart Lee Dykes with 7:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Staurovsky's 34-yard field goal made it 24-23 with 3:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
New England snapped a two-game losing streak with a season-best 192-yard ground 
attack, led by John Stephens' 126 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots erased a 10-6 halftime deficit on a 15-yard scoring run by rookie 
Patrick Egu on his first NFL carry. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo took a 7-0 lead on its first series of the game on Thomas' three-yard 
run. Staurovsky kicked field goals of 34 and 24 yards, cutting the lead to 7-6 
with 7:04 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' Scott Norwood kicked a 31-yard field goal with 35 seconds left in 
the first half.

L.A. SECONDARY ANSWERS THE CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: DEFENSIVE BACKS ARE IMPRESSIVE AGAINST THE CARDINALS' TRIO OF 
QUARTERBACKS, PICKING OFF FOUR PASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so the Phoenix quarterbacks were a less-than-illustrious trio: the 
journeyman, the punter and the rookie. 
</P>
<P>
So Gary Hogeboom has thrown just 45 touchdown passes and 55 interceptions in 
his 10 1/2 pro seasons. Sure, Tom Tupa was better known as the nation's best 
punter than for his quarterbacking skills as a senior at Ohio State in 1987. 
And, yeah, rookie Timm Rosenbach had never thrown a pass in the National 
Football League before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But don't ask the Ram secondary to throw back any of the four passes they 
intercepted Sunday during their 37-14 victory over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Hogeboom's high lob that cornerback Jerry Gray collected when Hogeboom 
and receiver Ernie Jones got their signals crossed early in the second quarter. 
Jones went one way and the ball came down to Gray, who was the only one within 
15 yards of the ball. You almost thought he was going to call a fair catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him if he was going to donate that one to charity," LeRoy Irvin said, 
smiling. "He said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
You can excuse the Rams' defensive backfield if it isn't feeling all that 
charitable these days. It has taken so much heat for the Rams' defensive woes 
of late, Sunday's game was like a cool breeze. Forget the Santa Ana winds and 
the 90-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams rank 27th in the league in pass defense, bouncing out of dead last to 
pass the New York Jets last week. And even when the defense shined in a 31-10 
victory over the Giants last week, Ram Coach John Robinson said he was 
"disturbed" by the play of his secondary. 
</P>
<P>
But this Sunday, Robinson found himself praising his much-maligned defensive 
backfield . . . for a few seconds, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing more aggressive ball in the secondary," Robinson allowed. "We're 
finishing plays better. But it's a week-to-week thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been bloodied and we're not pretending that we don't have some big 
wounds and black eyes. And a lot of interceptions are erratically thrown 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Big Four Sunday pretty much fell into that category: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hogeboom overthrew Jones on the third play of the game and hit safety 
Michael Stewart right in the numbers. Stewart sprinted down the sidelines into 
the end zone and the Rams grabbed a quick 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Early in the second quarter, the Rams blitzed, Jones didn't react as 
Hogeboom predicted and the Phoenix quarterback sent up the flare that Gray 
settled under before returning it 10 yards. Two plays later, Bobby Delpino went 
32 yards to put the Rams up, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gray intercepted his second pass late in the third quarter when Tupa hit 
Roy Green in the hands but the ball popped up and into Gray's arms. The Rams 
drove to the Cardinal 23-yard line and Mike Lansford kicked a 40-yard field 
goal that gave the Rams a 30-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And even Clifford Hicks, who was replacing the injured Irvin at right 
cornerback, got into the act when he stepped in front of Don Holmes to pick off 
a Rosenbach pass in the end zone with less than two minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Tupa, Hogeboom, Rosenbach, yeah, but, you know what? They were the 
quarterbacks," linebacker Mel Owens said. "I don't care who they put out there, 
that's who you've got to play. You can't get Johnny Unitas every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are grateful for that. In the past month or so, they have helped 
elevate a few quarterbacks to Hall-of-Fame performances . . . for one game, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody felt more responsible for the secondary's problems than Gray. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped two possible interceptions during the heartbreaking loss in Buffalo. 
One he felt he should have returned for a touchdown. The other miss came late 
in the fourth quarter and would have saved the Rams from the embarrassment of 
wilting in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in Minnesota two weeks ago, he dropped another easy interception that 
appeared to be a sure touchdown and the Rams lost, 23-21. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, they came my way and I made the plays," Gray said. "In Buffalo, I had 
two chances and didn't make the plays. In Minnesota, I should've had that one 
and I didn't. During that slump, it just seemed like we were one step away from 
making the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one of the best games I've ever played as a Ram. We were 
dominating today. And all these interceptions are kind of contagious, too." 
</P>
<P>
Gray also was quick to point out that the Rams' pass rush played a big role. 
Phoenix quarterbacks were sacked four times and chased out of the pocket all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Pass coverage and pass rush go hand in hand," he said. "If you make the 
quarterback run, he's gonna throw the ball out of desperation." 
</P>
<P>
The Ram defensive backs can relate to that feeling. The secondary was supposed 
to be a strength in the preseason and soon they had become designated whipping 
boys. Coming into Sunday's game, Phoenix safety Tim McDonald had as many 
interceptions as all the Ram defensive backs combined. 
</P>
<P>
So they picked off some dying quails Sunday. It's better than going hunting and 
coming home with an empty bag again.

GLANVILLE ENJOYS KEEPING THEM LOOSE;

OILERS: COACH MARCHES TO BEAT OF HIS OWN DRUMMER, BUT HE GETS RESULTS AND HIS 
PLAYERS LIKE PLAYING FOR HIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
A study in black, Coach Jerry Glanville of the Houston Oilers prowls the 
sideline at the Astrodome, which is called the House of Pain by Oiler players. 
</P>
<P>
The Oiler colors are powder blue and red, but Glanville doesn't wear either. 
His ensemble for Sunday's game against the Raiders consisted of custom-made 
black cowboy boots, black pants with a silver belt buckle almost as big as the 
Lombardi Trophy, a black shirt with the Oiler logo on the chest and a rat 
stitched on the sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he wear black? 
</P>
<P>
"So people can spot me on the sidelines," Glanville said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he minded if Glanville wears black, Oiler owner Bud Adams said that 
the coach could wear black underwear, too. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Oilers try to intimidate opponents like the Raiders of old, 
Glanville insists that Oilers aren't the new Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the new Oilers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sport where coaches roll off an assembly line that removes any 
individuality, Glanville is eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
"You're only here for a hiccup and you might as well have some fun," Glanville 
said in a Texas drawl. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville has loads of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"You never think he's serious, but deep down he's serious," said Drew Hill, the 
Oilers' injured wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville serious? Be serious! 
</P>
<P>
The stories of Glanville leaving tickets for dead celebrities like Elvis 
Presley and James Dean are legend. 
</P>
<P>
Although Glanville has stopped leaving the tickets at the request of Adams, he 
hasn't lost his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis was here today. I saw him in the south end zone," Glanville said with a 
laugh. But Glanville wasn't laughing after the Oilers got off to a 2-3 start 
this season. There were whispers that his job was on the line because the team 
was playing so poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Did Glanville believe he was under fire? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I don't think there's many guys in this league who have worked 
on an assembly line and carried 100-pound flower bags. People tell me I've got 
a tough job, but this job is a lot easier than where I used to work." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if Glanville's critics had their way, he would have been back on the 
assembly line after the Oilers' slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a great deal of pressure on myself," he said. "Nobody within the 
organization has ever put pressure on me. But every good football coach, 
whether he's a head coach or an assistant coach, puts pressure on himself." 
</P>
<P>
But Glanville has managed to stay ahead of the lynch mob. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers have climbed back into title contention in the AFC Central by 
winning five of their last six and three straight, including Sunday's 23-7 
victory over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three-game winning streak is the longest in Glanville's four-year 
tenure as head coach, he isn't overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have time to enjoy it much," Glanville said. "We won't sleep 
tonight. We never allow anyone to go to sleep if we win. You've got to stay up 
all night." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers like Glanville's loose style. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a different bird," said Oiler guard Bruce Matthews. "He's not afraid to 
be himself. We all have our quirks, but his are more obvious. He likes to do 
his own thing. And if we keep winning like we are now it's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
What's it like to play for Glanville? 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," quarterback Warren Moon said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Moon and Glanville clashed after Glanville replaced Hugh Campbell as the Oiler 
head coach with two games remaining in the 1985 season. Moon thought that he 
had no place in Glanville's conservative, run-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
They've settled their differences and Moon is allowed to pass at will. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, who completed 20 of 30 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns against 
the Raiders, has passed for over 200 yards in nine of his last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a great quarterback," said wide receiver Curtis Duncan, who 
caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Moon. "He's having another Pro Bowl year." 
</P>
<P>
The only mistake Moon made was throwing an interception to kill a first-quarter 
drive. While scrambling, he double-pumped and tried to force a pass that was 
intercepted by Mike Harden. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon more than made up for throwing the interception. He even threw a block 
to spring running back Mike Rozier. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do whatever it takes to win," Moon said. "I'm going to be smart, but I 
realized that I wasn't going to get hurt by trying to cut somebody. The worst 
thing that can happen to me is that somebody might fall on me."

BIG WEST PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
MORRISON HAPPY, EVEN THOUGH HE RETURNS AT THE BOTTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oct. 15 was a happy day for Stan Morrison, which besides being his birthday is 
the day college basketball teams are allowed to begin practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I blew the whistle for the first time Oct. 15, I really got chills and 
goosebumps like the first time when I was a high school coach," Morrison said. 
"Only people who have been in coaching and then out of it can understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who had once been a successful coach at Pacific, spent the past three 
years at UC Santa Barbara, working as the athletic director after he resigned 
at USC. He left coaching behind in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But he yearned to get back on the court, and now he has, taking over at San 
Jose State for Bill Berry, who was fired after a season in which 10 players 
walked out in a dispute with Berry. The Spartans finished with a 5-23 record, 
1-17 in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The talent on his team this season might be more similar to a high school team 
than Morrison would like. He has two returning starters in guards Tom Desiano 
and Dwain Daniels, but both were reserves before the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Four players who walked out talked with Morrison about returning. Morrison 
considered it for about 10 days, but he decided not to allow it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of coaches were waiting to see if I would give license to that method of 
solving problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won't, but he said he is helping the players transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison calls Ken Young, a 6-7 forward who sat out last season to concentrate 
on academics, "easily our best player." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Cannon, a freshman from Crenshaw High School, is likely to start at point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on Morrison's roster, talent is somewhat lacking. Numbers, however, 
are not. Morrison is carrying 19 players and says the bench will be two rows 
deep at home games. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the new faces, the Spartans have a new arena on campus, the 
4,600-seat, $36-million Recreation and Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
But it will take some time before Morrison can reconstruct the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easily the most inexperienced team I've ever been around," Morrison said. 
"It's also one of the most enjoyable. There are no egos -- there are no reasons 
to have egos." 
</P>
<P>
A look at the rest of the conference: 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE FULLERTON 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 16-13, 10-8 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie) 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos has been regarded as one of the country's best little-known 
players so often by now that he may cease to qualify for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-7, extremely athletic forward, Ceballos led the conference in scoring 
last season with a 21-point average and was second in rebounding, averaging 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
Three other starters -- sophomore point guard Wayne Williams, senior shooting 
guard Mark Hill and senior center John Sykes also return to a team that last 
season was picked to finish ninth in the conference, but surprised almost 
everyone -- including Nevada Las Vegas, upsetting the Rebels. Their performance 
under acting Coach John Sneed helped hand Sneed a three-year contract at 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE LONG BEACH 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 13-15, 10-8 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie) 
</P>
<P>
This is the mystery team of the conference, although the talented newcomers are 
no secret to the coaches who competed for them. Nine of 14 players will be 
playing for Long Beach for the first time, and five didn't play anywhere last 
year, some of them coming off redshirt years because of injuries, transfers or 
academics. The standouts inside are Kevin Cutler, a 6-7, 220-pound junior 
forward who sat out last season when he became academically ineligible after 
transferring from a community college, and Frankie Edwards, a sophomore out of 
Millikan High who was ineligible last season under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Mitchell, a senior guard, is the only returning player who will start. 
Troy Joseph, Kenny Jarvis and Lucious Harris are also battling for starting 
spotd. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking about Long Beach State and our improvement," Coach Joe 
Harrington said. "The truth is, we will be improved and I'm excited about this 
year. We ought to be improved. We spent three years recruiting our butts off to 
improve and we ought to get there." 
</P>
<P>
FRESNO STATE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 15-14, 9-9 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Seventh 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron Adams began his preseason comments to the media with a greeting: 
"It's good to be here," he said. There was an extra note of sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' teams won only nine games in each of his first two seasons, and he was 
considered on shaky ground until his team pulled out a winning record last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbert Hooker, a guard who averaged 11 points a game as a freshman, is back, 
as are senior point guard Bijou Baly and part-time starting forward Pat 
Riddlesprigger, a sophomore. The performance of new players will be critical, 
particularly swingman Tod Bernard, a sophomore who was academically ineligible 
last season, and junior forward Chris Henderson, a transfer from DePaul who 
should become eligible in December. 
</P>
<P>
NEVADA LAS VEGAS 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 29-8, 16-2 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: First 
</P>
<P>
Even Jerry Tarkanian, usually loathe to admit his team's excellence, concedes 
that this team is special. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming center David Butler and forward Moses Scurry can regain their academic 
eligibility by December as expected, the only key player lost from the team 
that upset Arizona in making it to the final eight of the NCAA tournament last 
season is forward George Ackles, out with a broken wrist. And added to the mix 
is forward Larry Johnson, the 6-foot-7 Odessa (Tex.) College transfer who has, 
for the time being, relegated forward Stacey Augmon, the Big West player of the 
year last season, to second billing on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has better talent than our Final Four team," Tarkanian said, 
referring to the Rebels' 1987 team. "But our Final Four team had perfect 
chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, with Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt in the backcourt, are the 
preseason No. 1 team by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we should be No. 1," Tarkanian said. "I think that after Dec. 
17 (when Butler and Scurry should become eligible), we are right there with the 
best teams, like Syracuse, Georgetown and LSU." 
</P>
<P>
NEW MEXICO STATE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 21-11, 12-6 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Second 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies are still smarting over being left out of the NCAA tournament last 
season despite finishing second to UNLV and winning 21 games. A nonconference 
schedule that was perceived to be weak probably was the reason. 
</P>
<P>
This season, with very little experience, the Aggies shouldn't be expected to 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forwards James Anderson and Keith Hill are the only starters back. Guard 
William Benjamin should also contribute. Otherwise, Coach Neil McCarthy is 
counting on starters to emerge from among a group of community college 
transfers -- guard Randy Brown, forwards Michael New and Rick Fluckey, center 
Jason Trask and swingman Reggie Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 7-21, 3-15 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Ninth 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers made progress last season in Coach Bob Thomason's first year, but 
still are just a notch ahead of San Jose State in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be a much improved team this season, but we need to develop our team 
confidence and you can only do that by winning games," Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific has five starters back, but newcomers may replace some of them. Key 
players are junior center Don Lyttle, sophomore guard Dell Demps and community 
college transfer Anthony Woods, a point guard. Rich Ressa, another community 
college transfer, is likely to start at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 12-17, 8-10 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Eighth 
</P>
<P>
As always, Coach Bill Mulligan gets to the point. "Our biggest problem last 
year was that we averaged 82 points per game and our opponents averaged 86, 
plus shot 51% from the floor," he said. "We are going to have to straighten 
that out." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan abandoned the Anteaters' impersonation of Loyola Marymount last 
season, and says that this year Irvine will try to become better defensively. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan says Ricky Butler, the 6-7, 255-pound center, is much improved, and 
that Irvine will go to him more. Other returning starters are senior guard Rod 
Palmer and junior forward Jeff Herdman, who led the nation in three-point 
percentage last year before a late slump. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan says he is committed this year to playing shooting guard Justin 
Anderson, instead of pulling him when he starts cold. Rob Doktorczyk, a senior 
forward, is the likely other starter, with senior Mike Labat as sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 21-9, 11-7 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Third 
</P>
<P>
Guard Carrick DeHart is finally a senior after starting 87 of 89 games his 
first three seasons, and forward Eric McArthur, who led the conference in 
rebounding and blocked shots although he is just 6-6, is also back. Paul 
Johnson and Mike Elliott are the other likely starters in the backcourt, with 
Gary Gray joining McArthur inside. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos lost inside player Mike Doyle, who shared the scoring lead with 
DeHart with a 16-point average, when he decided to leave school last spring. 
Coach Jerry Pimm's preseason concern has been finding a point guard. DeHart may 
move over to the position, and Elliott is another of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
UTAH STATE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Records: 12-16, 10-8 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie) 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies were the last conference team other than UNLV to play in the NCAA 
tournament, making it in 1988 after winning the Big West tournament. After a 
disappointing season last year, Coach Kohn Smith is starting over. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one senior on the roster, and 70% of last season's scoring is 
gone, including Reid Newey, who was second in the conference. Kendal 
Youngblood, a guard who was the Big West freshman of the year last season, is 
the top returner. Also back: forward Darrel White, the only senior. Guard 
Albert Chappell, who had become a freshman starter late in the season before 
injuring his knee, returned to practice only last week.

</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FORMER JUNIOR COLLEGE PLAYER OF THE YEAR HAS OPPONENTS 
STRETCHING FOR SUPERLATIVES AND REBELS' ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT ENTHRALLED BECAUSE 
OF LOW-KEY APPROACH TO SUCCESS.

<P>
This is a town where order of billing means something, and Jerry Tarkanian 
follows protocol when he talks about his team. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Augmon, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Augmon was only the premier player on a team that upset Arizona in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament last season, then fell one 
victory short of the Final Four. He is only an Olympian, and was only the 
player of the year in the Big West Conference last season as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is only an opening act. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson is not the college player of the year yet, though there are those 
who insist that it is a formality, picking him over Louisiana State's Chris 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
A transfer from Odessa Junior College in Texas where he was the national junior 
college player of the year the past two seasons, Johnson has played two games 
of Division I ball, scoring in the 20s in both. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and professional scouts say that if he comes out after this season, 
which Johnson admits is a possibility, he is a near-certain lottery pick in the 
National Basketball Assn. draft, possibly in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
He is a power forward with finesse and agility to play outside. 
</P>
<P>
He is a dominating rebounder, averaging 17 a game last season, along with 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
He can run -- if not at the pace of Loyola Marymount, which left him huffing in 
last Wednesday night's game, then at least with California, as he did last 
Friday night, finishing off the Rebels' break. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to get in a little better shape to run with us thinner guys," said 
Augmon, his close friend. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson can shoot, making 63% of his shots from the field last season. And he 
can shoot free throws -- at least in comparison to the Rebels, who struggle at 
the line. Johnson hit 75% last season. UNLV shot 63%. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Johnson looks like Karl Malone. Tarkanian compares him to Armon 
Gilliam. Purdue's Gene Keady, who coached Johnson in the World University Games 
this summer, has called him the best player he has coached since Sidney 
Moncrief, when Keady was an assistant at Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
But before the NBA gets its next Johnson, there is at least one season to be 
played. Tarkanian says this UNLV team, ranked No. 1 by the Associated Press, 
has better players than the 1987 team that made it to the Final Four, although 
he holds that the 1987 team had "perfect chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the team that made it to the final eight last season is back, although 
center David Butler is academically ineligible until the semester break and 
forward Moses Scurry has yet to complete course work to become eligible. The 
Rebels are without forward George Ackles, who broke his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Hunt and Greg Anthony are back at the guard spots, and of course there 
is Augmon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for now, expectations are heaped upon Johnson, a 20-year-old whose build 
is part tight end, part Mike Tyson -- 6-foot-7, 250 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hardly seems to notice. In fact, the only thing that seems to be as 
universally agreed upon as his prospects for success is that a lot of people 
would like to see him do well. 
</P>
<P>
Said Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs, who finished second in a recruiting battle for 
Johnson that wasn't very close: "He's not only a great player, but you're going 
to be for him unless you're playing against him." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma will play UNLV Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
People in the athletic department at UNLV like Johnson because he is open and 
friendly, confident but not haughty. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will walk into an office, and tap his finger at a photo of himself and 
Augmon with admiration: "That's a pretty good poster." 
</P>
<P>
He has arrived in Las Vegas from a rough neighborhood in South Dallas by way of 
Odessa and proclaims his life unchanged. "They have McDonald's here just like 
back in Texas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much to do in Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
"Rent some movies, grab something to eat," Johnson said. "I don't like to party 
much." 
</P>
<P>
In Las Vegas, there is plenty to do. Johnson says he still prefers renting a 
John Wayne movie or hanging out at a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been among the best players in the country the past two seasons, 
but he has been in Odessa, stashed away from television audiences. But for a 
question over the validity of his Scholastic Aptitude Test scores out of high 
school, he would have begun his career at Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Johnson played at Odessa, and in the second recruiting battle, UNLV 
won, although not without a mini-scandal when Tarkanian was photographed with 
Johnson at summer league game, implying that the two spoke in a breech of NCAA 
rules. As it turned out, the photograph was a routine camp photograph, and the 
two have said there was no illegal contact. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV got Johnson thanks largely to a recruiting effort by Augmon, who met him 
on a junior international team coached by Larry Brown after the players 
finished high school. The two became close at the 1988 Olympic trials, where 
Johnson was the only junior college player invited. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around him and I know his capabilities," Augmon said. "He's 
unstoppable. He's so strong and agile, he can do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson chose UNLV in spite of the acknowledged possibility of NCAA probation.

"I made my choice to come to Vegas," Johnson said. "If I went somewhere else, 
no telling what I might miss. I never heard anyone say Vegas will go on 
probation. I heard people say they might. That's been going on for years. I 
made my commitment." 
</P>
<P>
The first recruiting battle for Johnson was not close, either. A first-team 
McDonald's All-American at Skyline High School in Dallas, he signed with 
Southern Methodist, then coached by Dave Bliss, who is now at New Mexico. 
Johnson had taken the Scholastic Aptitude Test as a high school junior, but had 
failed to score 700, the requirement for freshman eligibility under Proposition 
48. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson took the test again and says he scored 800. But the testing service 
questioned the score because of the dramatic improvement, and asked him to take 
the test a third time. Johnson said no, and SMU told him he would have to sit 
out his freshman season on the basis of the first score. Johnson enrolled at 
Odessa instead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the dramatic improvement in his score was the result of two 
preparatory courses he took, and that he decided not to retake the test partly 
because of the influence of his high school coach, J.D. Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, it was no big deal to me, but my high school coach said they are 
talking about your honesty," Johnson said. "I didn't have to take it over. I 
know I took my test (and not a stand-in for him)." 
</P>
<P>
He chose Odessa to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I was peaking as far as basketball," Johnson said. "I didn't want to sit out . 
. . The route I took, basically I think I'm doing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson seemed likely to join Brown at Kansas before Brown left for the NBA. 
After that, the choices narrowed to Oklahoma and UNLV, and Johnson settled on 
UNLV last September. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson began his athletic career as a boxer in the Police Athletic League of 
South Dallas. "I'm from the baddest part of town you ever saw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was well-known by police, who picked him up three times for such offenses as 
stealing fruit and bicycles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Athletic League program was designed to keep youngsters out of 
trouble through sports. Johnson was a boxer, then a quarterback who outgrew his 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Then came basketball, and Johnson said he's been on the straight and narrow 
since. He said he neither drinks nor does drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"When I discovered sports, it wasn't hard at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By high school, his mind was on basketball. His senior year, he averaged 28 
points a game and 18 rebounds. Junior college was no harder to master. Now, 
with more eyes watching than ever, it's time to try the big-time.

Almost before most people knew the overtime was under way Sunday night at 
Edmonton, Mark Messier scored to give the Oilers a 5-4 victory over the Chicago 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight seconds had elapsed when Messier took a breakaway pass from Kevin 
Lowe and slid the puck underneath Chicago goalie Alain Chevrier. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 13th goal for Messier, who earlier assisted on three goals to help 
Edmonton build a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago tied it with goals by Doug Wilson and Steve Larmer just 91 seconds 
apart in the middle of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
With their second win in a row, the Oilers jumped from last place in the Smythe 
Division to a tie for second with the Kings and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 2, Buffalo 2 -- Soviet player Igor Larionov scored on a power play 
early in the third period at Vancouver to help give the Canucks a tie.

SEASON IS BRIGHTENING FOR CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weekend weather report in Cleveland, where Ron Harper spent three-plus 
seasons as a professional basketball player, called for very cold temperatures, 
and suddenly he comes to Los Angeles to bask in temperatures in the high 80s. 
</P>
<P>
But that's nothing. With the Clippers, the outlook usually is bleak. Now, the 
outlook is very bright. Harper, the long-coveted shooting guard, and Benoit 
Benjamin, the recently-signed center, were in the fold. 
</P>
<P>
Both took part in their first Clipper practice of the season Sunday, a 
fast-paced two-hour workout at the Sports Arena. No suprising developments -- 
Harper looked every bit the standout open-court player who was acquired from 
the Cavaliers in the trade for Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry, 
while Benjamin appeared to weigh about 275 pounds -- but a day the Clippers had 
long looked forward to had finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say this is one of the best days in the past eights weeks," said 
Benjamin, clearly excited to rejoin teammates after a holdout that kept him out 
of training camp and the first seven games. "I'm back on the floor doing what I 
enjoy doing best, playing in front of the fans in L.A. They critique me, but I 
still love 'em." 
</P>
<P>
According to agent Henry Holmes, Benjamin's contract, depending on the 
incentives attained, could be worth $3.85 million over two seasons, the 
Clippers holding the option on the second. Holmes declined to discuss specific 
numbers of the five-part bonus package for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
The weight clause, the fifth incentive, is 265 pounds, but with some 
flexibility in enforcement. Benjamin could go over and be fined, but then have 
the money returned by bettering the 265 in a future weigh-in. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, declining to say how much he weighs, said he will be ready for 
Wednesday's game against New Jersey at the Sports Arena, but will need a week 
to 10 days to reach top form. Joe Wolf, a natural forward who has pleased 
coaches with his play, will again start at center against the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Casey said he will wait before deciding if Tom Garrick, a backup 
point guard who has made 18 of 27 shots over three games, or Harper will open 
at shooting guard. It depends how quick the former Cleveland Cavalier learns 
the Clipper system. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper is in the final season of a four-year contract, which makes him a 
restricted free agent at the end of 1989-90. Although no meetings have been 
set, the Clippers and agent Mark Termini plan to talk in the future, and the 
Clippers have no plans to lose Harper, even if it means matching an offer sheet 
next summer. . . .The state of new jerseys: Danny Manning will wear uniform No. 
5 upon his return. David Rivers will take No. 44, giving up his No. 4 to 
Harper. . . . Manning continues to practice and is drawing rave reviews, but no 
date has been set for him being activated.

GOLF AT SHERWOOD CC; 
</P>
<P>
STRANGE-O'MEARA TEAM WINS BY 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You know you're having a good day on the golf course when you slash at a ball 
from waist-level off the side of a mountain while wedged between two giant 
boulders, and you still par the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the fortune of Curtis Strange and Mark O'Meara on Sunday as they 
teamed to complete a wire-to-wire run with a 10-under-par 62, giving them a 
six-stroke victory in the $1-million Ronald McDonald Children's Charities 
Invitational in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
And you also know you're not involved in medal-play golf when you do shoot a 62 
but are beaten in the round by four strokes. Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus 
combined for a 58 on the tough, Sherwood Country Club course that Jack built. 
They were playing a scramble format, a common game among amateurs in which both 
players hit, then select the best ball for the second shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling Mark that I wanted to win by 10 strokes," said Strange. "I 
didn't mean it to sound cocky, but with this wild format, I honestly didn't 
know what it was going to take and I didn't want either of us to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Their only tough moment came on the 16th hole, when each hit tee shots into a 
steep embankment above a stream. Strange bailed the team out with an awkward, 
baseball-type swipe at the ball, sending it far down the fairway on the par-5 
hole, which they parred. 
</P>
<P>
Strange and O'Meara each earned $125,000 for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Langer and John Mahaffey tied with Tom Weiskopf and Lanny Wadkins for 
second place. The Norman-Nicklaus team was another stroke back, tied with Ray 
Floyd and Chip Beck. 
</P>
<P>
Norman chipped in from 60 feet on the 18th hole for one of his team's nine 
birdies. They also carded three eagles and a bogey in the round and Norman was 
rewarded on the 18th hole with a roar from spectators and a leaping high-five 
from Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament raised nearly $1.5 million for charities, including the Ronald 
McDonald House, a support program for children with cancer.

SELIG UNDAUNTED AFTER SELLING HIS SEATTLE SKYSCRAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DIETRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When maverick Seattle skyscraper developer Martin Selig fell behind on his 
light bill last winter, his competitors figured that he might be in trouble. 
And when nearly $1 million in mortgage checks on five of his buildings bounced 
this summer, they were pretty well convinced. 
</P>
<P>
But by mid-October, Selig was back in the black, although he was no longer 
literally on top of this city's hot commercial real estate market. He solved 
his cash problems by agreeing to sell Seattle's tallest building, the 76-story 
Columbia Seafirst Center, for $354 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was the latest twist in the unlikely saga of a controversial 
52-year-old businessman who started with nothing and who remains, even after 
the deal, Seattle's biggest property holder. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the skyscraper to tenant Seafirst Corp., a subsidiary of 
BankAmerica Corp., was the biggest real estate sale in Washington state 
history. The 986-foot building was the tallest on the West Coast when it was 
completed in 1985, although the First Interstate Tower in Los Angeles later 
topped it by 73 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Selig's practiced positivism was in full bloom after the sale. "The sale of 
this building is not a setback, it is a phenomenal victory," he proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he reasoned, the sale price is $102 million more than the mortgage 
he holds. Just starting construction of the 1.5-million-square foot building in 
a city Seattle's size was "a significant risk," Selig said, and now it must be 
viewed as a winning gamble. 
</P>
<P>
But the necessity of selling, caused by depressed rents from a temporary glut 
of new skyscrapers, has to hurt. Selig once called the 10-year process to plan, 
build and fill the tower "an Olympian feat." 
</P>
<P>
"The Space Needle told people where Seattle was," he once remarked. "Columbia 
Center tells people Seattle has arrived." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is another building of this size in the world owned by an 
individual," Selig boasted when the tower was completed. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of new buildings from competitors forced Selig to keep his rents down 
at Columbia Center and at his other buildings, and postpone his bills. At one 
point he owed $640,000 to Seattle City Light for electricity, since paid. 
</P>
<P>
Both Selig and his skyscraper remain controversial. Critics have charged that 
the black-glass, curved edifice is out of scale with Seattle and that several 
other Selig buildings are too derivative of Houston-style architecture. The 
tower and the swank private club that Selig installed at the top was a project 
driven by ego instead of civic need, they sniped. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen activists who preferred the days when the horizon was dominated by 
Mount Rainier launched a campaign that resulted in new city zoning that makes 
it impossible to build a skyscraper as high as Columbia Center again. This 
year, voters also approved a lid on future downtown office construction. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasts, however, think that the spire nicely punctuates a newly cocky 
skyline in a city trying to cash in on Pacific Rim trade. 
</P>
<P>
Selig, an avid collector of modern art, said of his buildings: "You have to 
look at them as sculptures." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity," Selig said of the building code in force in the late 
1970s. "I wanted to build the maximum building I could build at that time." 
</P>
<P>
The present cap, he said, could make existing buildings more valuable but may 
hurt future downtown growth. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the skyscraper has also provoked controversy. It was assessed for 
tax purposes at only $195 million. The big price tag in Seattle's hot real 
estate market has prompted county officials to propose recalculating 
assessments of all commercial and residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
Turmoil is nothing new to Selig. He and his parents emigrated to the United 
States in 1940 as Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, when he was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
His drive was apparent early. Shortly before the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, he 
gave construction workers some Space Needle sweat shirts that he was hawking in 
return for a ride to the top of the new landmark. And he bought his first 
commercial property while a student at the University of Washington. He 
borrowed part of the down payment and sold the property a year later for a good 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
With aggressive borrowing, attention to construction details and personal 
service to tenants, he has averaged about one new building per year since the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a local empire of big office buildings that he puts in "the high 
20s" with an assessed value of more than half a billion dollars. Observers 
believe that the true market value of his holdings is at least 50% higher. 
</P>
<P>
But while immensely successful, Selig has remained somewhat aloof from 
Seattle's clubby establishment. He keeps a low profile on most civic issues, 
will not discuss his personal life with the media (he is married with two 
children) and is reluctant to talk about what makes him tick. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he concentrates on making Seattle's profile higher with buildings. "I 
love Seattle and am pleased to be able to play such an active role in its 
evolution," he said in a statement issued with the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for additional Selig buildings of 10, 19 and 36 stories. 
"We absolutely are still here," he said.

JAPAN EXPO COMING INTO ITS OWN IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: LAUNCHED IN LATE 1980, THE EVENT HAS ATTRACTED EVER-WIDENING INTEREST IN 
JAPANESE CULTURE AND PRODUCTS. AND FOUNDER NAGAO MASUDA, WHO MADE IT A SUCCESS, 
IS EXPANDING HIS SMALL EMPIRE BY PRODUCING OTHER PROMOTIONAL SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Nagao Masuda sought support for a Japanese trade and cultural exhibit in 
Los Angeles in 1980, officials of the Japan External Trade Organization tried 
to talk him out of the idea for fear that the event would exacerbate the 
already chilly trade relations between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But Masuda, a Japanese banker's son and one-time TV cameraman who has a 
reputation as a creative promoter, pursued his project with stunning results. 
Launched just after the September, 1980, airing of the NBC-TV mini-series 
"Shogun" fueled wider interest in Japanese culture, Japan Expo became a huge 
event that drew Japanese TV coverage as well as appearances from dignitaries 
such as Mayor Tom Bradley. During its Nov. 24-26 run this year at the downtown 
Los Angeles Convention Center, the exhibit of Japanese consumer goods, food and 
artists is expected to draw about 90,000 visitors, employ 55 people and gross 
about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was lucky to think of the idea," said Masuda, 47, who in true 
promoter's spirit, recalled that he donned a Samurai warrior's suit of armor to 
greet visitors at the first expo in 1980. "It was a big hit. I was in the right 
place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
As interest in Japan has grown in the wake of the country's increased economic 
clout, many have tried to capitalize on Americans' curiosity about the nation 
as well as cater to the cultural needs of the growing Japanese-American 
community in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. festivals centering on Japan have become popular. In September, 
for example, Beverly Hills paid tribute to Japan in connection with the city's 
75th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
But Masuda, who emigrated to the United States from Japan 18 years ago, has 
become something of a Los Angeles institution in trying to bridge the cultural 
gap between the two countries. And although his maverick style bucks Japanese 
business tradition and draws criticism from some colleagues who call him 
boastful, Masuda has found a lucrative niche promoting his homeland to tens of 
thousands of Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem of the Japanese is that they are so misunderstood," said 
Holmes Stoner, head of the Los Angeles firm Artesa Inc., which specializes in 
advertising to Latinos and Asian-Americans. "Nagao has become a conduit for 
greater understanding. He tries to join Japan to the U.S. in so many ways. . . 
. Japan needs more like him." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Masuda's business ethics appear unseemly to one acquaintance, who used the 
Japanese term applied to the nightclub or entertainment world -- mizu shobai, 
or literally "water trade," to describe the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Masuda is very creative," said the associate, who declined to be 
identified. "But he exaggerates a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Water does seem to leak from some of Masuda's claims. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Expo promotional literature boasts that the event has drawn as many as 
93,000 people. But many observers put the total much lower. Convention 
spokeswoman Kris Morita, who predicts that Japan Expo could draw about 90,000 
people this year because organizers are using two exhibition halls for the 
first time, estimated that attendance since the mid-1980s -- although growing 
-- has not topped 75,000 for all three days. 
</P>
<P>
Masuda also tells media outlets that Japan Expo is "produced by" the Japan 
America Friendship Foundation Inc. The foundation, also housed in Masuda's 
Gardena offices, describes itself in brochures as a "nonprofit cultural and 
educational organization." As a result, Masuda often secures lower, 
non-commercial ad rates and other financial breaks to promote Japan Expo, a 
colleague said. However, Masuda -- who is chairman of both Japan Expo and the 
nonprofit foundation -- said in an interview that the Japan Expo event is a 
profit-seeking venture. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the discrepancies, Masuda would say only, "We don't really 
care about the money. . . . We just want to bring Japanese culture to the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a "trade and cultural exhibition," Japan Expo resembles a car show, 
consumer electronics exhibit, food fair and arts festival -- all rolled into 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The expo -- which lost money during its first four years -- is now bigger than 
any other ethnic festival held at the convention center, including past events 
pegged to the Soviet Union, Mexico and China, said convention spokeswoman 
Morita. Although Japan Expo draws about half as many people as the center's 
largest annual event -- the auto show -- it has "good strong promotion and 
marketing," said Morita. 
</P>
<P>
For U.S. companies, Japan Expo offers a chance to introduce their products and 
services to the Japanese-American community. At past shows, for instance, 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has offered event-goers three minutes of 
free long-distance calls to Japan from its booth at the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many Japanese companies use the event to conduct market research. 
Most of the leading Japanese auto makers, including Nissan and Honda, will have 
new and prototype cars on hand. Consumer electronics firms, such as JVC, will 
display their latest wares, and an assortment of Japanese food companies and 
local restaurants will serve their latest creations. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the commerce, there are a host of cultural exhibitions highlighting 
traditional Japanese arts, ranging from doll makers to wood block printers. All 
told, about 60 different artists will fly in from Japan, Masuda says. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter reprinted in promotional material sent to Japanese companies this 
year, Mayor Bradley wrote of the event organizers: "I fully support your 
wholehearted efforts in bringing such a beautiful and colorful Japanese 
culture, entertainment and enterprises to the people of the U.S.A. This is 
truly a wonderful way to promote friendship." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 firms are expected to pay $1,000 or more to rent booths at the event. 
A 148-page exhibition guide, which last year featured 43 advertisers in a 
112-page issue, will generate $1,500 for each full-page black-and-white ad and 
$2,400 for each full-page color advertisement sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Expo officials estimate that the event will gross $750,000, although 
observers close to the company put the figure nearer to $500,000. Masuda won't 
say how profitable Japan Expo is. But the event earns enough to keep a 
five-member Japan Expo staff working year-round crisscrossing the Pacific -- as 
well as enough to enable Masuda to buy a house in Torrance and drive a 
Mercedes-Benz.

<P>
Masuda -- who has turned over the daily management of Japan Expo to his brother 
Norio Masuda, 45 -- has parlayed the success of Japan Expo into a mushrooming 
number of other promotional enterprises operated out of his Gardena offices. 
</P>
<P>
The ventures include a real estate development firm and at least four other 
exhibitions modeled after Japan Expo. Among them: the Asian Expo, the Japan 
Regional Food Products Fair as well as the World Gem &amp; Jewelry Show held in 
Japan and an upcoming USA Expo to be held in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
With all the activity, some wonder if Masuda is not spreading himself too thin. 
And a critic who once helped Masuda stage Japan Expo complained that Masuda's 
business style is "sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
The critic, who did not want to be identified, added: "People from Japan expect 
a more sophisticated show." But they forgive Masuda and Japan Expo keeps 
growing, the critic said, because "Mr. Masuda is a likable person with a very 
charming personality." 
</P>
<P>
Sporting near-shoulder length hair, designer jewelry and silk suits, Masuda's 
style is more akin to a Hollywood mogul than a Japanese-American businessman. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't look like the son of a banker, does he?" joked John K. Marumoto, 
vice president of Japan Expo, when Masuda recently greeted a visitor in his 
office. Masuda doesn't act the role of conservative businessman either. 
</P>
<P>
Masuda is one of the few local Japanese-American entrepreneurs who does not 
belong to the establishment Japanese Business Assn. of Los Angeles. And the 
association's director, Takashi Kawahito, is not expansive on the subject of 
Masuda. He declined to discuss the promoter or Japan Expo. Instead, he cited 
other Japanese cultural events in Los Angeles that, he said, "are popular, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
But endorsements of Japan Expo come in from as far away as the desk of former 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and that of California Gov. George 
Deukmejian, who last year extended written best wishes to event organizers. 
Likewise, Masuda's list of Japanese business associates is so extensive that 
his long-distance telephone bills often run dozens of pages. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Masuda is quite a successful businessman," said the promoter's old boss, 
Nobu Katagiri, who worked with Masuda at a Japanese TV station. "He left (TV) 
and established his own independent publishing company and then started Japan 
Expo. It was a very good idea," said Katagiri, who is now vice president of 
Asahi Homecast Co. of San Gabriel, which produces Japanese-language television 
programming for Channel 18. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Japan External Trade Organization, which once spurned Masuda, has 
changed its tune. As a Japanese government-supported agency it cannot 
financially back Japan Expo. Nevertheless, JETRO has offered behind-the-scenes 
support, according to Ted Hayashi, JETRO's director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become quite a big event for the Japanese community," Hayashi said of 
Japan Expo. "A lot of Japanese manufacturers and local (Japanese) governments 
participate. But this fair is for the public. It brings cultural things like 
traditional Japanese arts" to a wider American audience.

NEKOOSA TO WEIGH NEW $3.8-BILLION GEORGIA-PACIFIC BID; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: THE PAPER PRODUCTS FIRM EARLIER REJECTED A $58-PER-SHARE OFFER. NOW 
IT WILL DISCUSS A SWEETENED DEAL.

<P>
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has agreed to hold a special meeting of its 
directors to discuss Sunday's offer by Georgia-Pacific Corp. to increase its 
unwanted bid to buy the paper company. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Pacific raised its cash offer for Great Northern's outstanding shares 
from $58 a share, or a total of about $3.1 billion, to $63, or a total of $3.8 
billion. Great Northern has consistently rejected the takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The new bid was contained in a letter from Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall 
Hahn Jr. that was delivered Sunday to Great Northern Chairman William R. 
Laidig. The offer represents a 63% premium above Great Northern's share price 
prior to Georgia-Pacific's original buyout offer of Oct. 31, Georgia-Pacific 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern shares closed Friday at $61, down 12.5 cents in consolidated New 
York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern, a paper products company based in Norwalk, Conn., had said the 
original offer was too low, possibly illegal and could create a disastrous debt 
load on the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn also demanded a special meeting of Great Northern shareholders and urged 
Laidig to meet with him personally to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if you come to the 
negotiating table early and demonstrate to our satisfaction that greater value 
exists," he wrote in the letter, which was disclosed by Georgia-Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern officials issued a statement later Sunday saying they would hold 
a special meeting of the company's directors Tuesday to "consider and review 
the terms of the revised Georgia-Pacific offer." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reading from a statement, said the 
giant, Atlanta-based forest products company was "pleased that they're acting 
so expeditiously. We are hopeful they will exercise their fiduciary 
responsibility and respond positively to our very attractive offer." 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Georgia-Pacific extended the Nov. 29 expiration deadline for its 
offer to midnight Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said in his letter that Great Northern's contention that the takeover 
would subject the company to excessive debt was groundless. He said the $3.8 
billion in incremental debt required to finance the offer could be handled by 
the combined company without a restructuring or loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the combined company will be stronger and better able to meet the 
challenges of our industry, provide jobs and compete in the global marketplace 
than our two companies continuing on a stand-alone basis," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Pacific had revenue of $9.5 billion last year from sales of paper, 
other forest products and building materials. Great Northern, with 1988 sales 
of $3.6 billion, makes paper, cardboard and envelopes.

Westinghouse Electric Corp. is proposing big increases in the fees that it 
receives from the U.S. Department of Energy for managing nuclear weapons 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse officials said they want two to three times more for managing 
three nuclear weapons facilities and three other DOE nuclear units. The weapons 
facilities are Savannah River in South Carolina, Fernald near Cincinnati and 
the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh-based company earned $39 million in award fees this year, which 
are based on the company's performance in operating the plants. It estimates 
that it will earn up to $50 million in fiscal 1990 under existing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Jacobi, vice president in charge of Westinghouse's governmental 
business operations, said the company seeks the higher fees because of "risks 
we're seeing now that we didn't see before."

Kaiser Steel Receives Title to California Acreage: Kaiser Steel Resources Inc., 
in proceedings Wednesday before Judge Charles Matheson of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Denver, reached a settlement that will give the company title to 213 
acres adjacent to the former Kaiser steel mill near Fontana. The mill was shut 
down in the early 1980s when the company filed for bankruptcy court protection. 
Kaiser Steel Resources, the successor company to Kaiser Steel Co., will develop 
an industrial park on the 1,100-acre former steel mill property. (Filed Feb. 6, 
1987, Case No. 87E135)

CalMat Settles Greenmail Suit: The Los Angeles-based company settled a 
class-action suit Tuesday in which shareholders charged the company with paying 
greenmail to fend off the takeover advances of New Zealand financier Sir Ronald 
Brierley. In the settlement, CalMat agreed to repurchase 1 million shares of 
its stock, pay a special dividend of 10 cents a share and sell real estate for 
the benefit of shareholders. An attorney for shareholders estimated the value 
of the settlement at $60 million. The action against the company by a group of 
CalMat shareholders had been filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. (Filed

15-Year Home-Stake Case Ends: A federal judge in Tulsa, Okla., ordered five 
former officers of Home-Stake Production Co. to pay more than $127 million in 
damages to 1,600 people -- including several celebrities -- who were bilked. 
The case was initiated when the oil drilling tax shelter went sour in 1974, and 
the judgment brought down the curtain on prosecution of one of the largest 
Ponzi scheme cases ever. There were originally 39 defendants in the case, but 
some settled in 1982 and 1984.

MARKET BEAT: 2 LASER FIRMS COULD LOSE LUSTER, SHORT-SELLERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERB GREENBERG, HERB GREENBERG is a financial columnist for the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Has the laser industry gotten ahead of itself? That's what some analysts 
believe. While laser is still considered on the cutting edge of medical 
technology, with a number of companies showing great promise, it hasn't been 
proven effective or safe for all applications. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the mere mention of the word laser is enough to get stocks rolling. Witness 
the swift rise of Malvern, Pa.-based Surgical Laser Technologies, whose stock 
has been selling at a fat premium to its initial offering price since going 
public last month. But some short-sellers believe that the company could soon 
face scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration and shareholders. That's 
because at least one person has died from complications related to the use of 
the company's laser, a fact that wasn't disclosed at the time of the offering. 
Although the company doesn't deny the death, it says it was caused by doctor 
error and was an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the shorts circuit: Minneapolis-based GV Medical, whose laser catheter 
is used to pierce plaque in coronary arteries. The shorts have raised questions 
about the product's safety and effectiveness compared to other clot-busting 
methods. President James Grabek downplays both issues but acknowledges that 
sales have already started to slow. The company recently announced layoffs 
because of high inventories. Its stock is now near its 52-week low of $6. 
</P>
<P>
While on the subject of shorting: Another company that is attracting the bears 
is Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith Electronics. Robert Holmes, president of Gilford 
Securities in Chicago, believes that Zenith shares could fall by half in coming 
months, "by eighths and quarters," if its strategy as a television manufacturer 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes thinks that it will. He cites possible cash problems and hurdles related 
to capitalizing on high-definition TV. The Bush Administration has indicated 
that it plans to cut funds earmarked for HDTV development. Holmes started 
shorting the stock when it was $17.50 one month ago, after the company put its 
profitable computer business up for sale. The stock closed Friday at $12.375. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' firm was one of the first to advocate shorting Baldwin-United in the 
early '80s, long before the company filed for bankruptcy and its stock 
collapsed. More recently, he was shorting Texas Air as it rose into the high 
teens. It closed Friday at $12.25, and he's still short. 
</P>
<P>
As for Zenith, the most bullish scenario, he says, would be for the company to 
be acquired. But last year the company hired an investment banker to search for 
possible buyers, he points out, and couldn't find any. 
</P>
<P>
Gold diggers: Like most gold stocks, Newmont Mining has been rocketing higher 
during the past month. But unlike the rest, it has also been the subject of 
takeover speculation. Several analysts reject that possibility. "Unfeasible" is 
the way one put it, in part because of a standstill agreement that prevents 
Hanson Trust's Consolidated Gold Fields unit from selling its 49% stake in 
Newmont to someone else. Not only that, says Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette 
analyst John Tumazos, but Newmont is trading at 30 times its most recent 
12-month earnings, and "no mining company in the world can afford to pay" what 
it would take to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
His guess? He thinks that Hanson will skirt the standstill agreement by copying 
what Carl C. Icahn did with his chunk of Texaco stock: He sold it as a block 
trade through a dozen brokers at prices below Texaco's market price at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
What are some of the Big Board's worst stocks right now? According to Joe 
Barthel, a technical analyst at Hopper Soliday &amp; Co. in Great Neck, N.Y., 
potentially serious losers include Hexcel Corp., Fleetwood Enterprises, Rohr 
Industries, TransTechnology Corp., Morgan Products, Hitachi Ltd. and Zenith. 
Barthel bases his opinion on a variety of technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
His "short-sale ideas," as he calls them, performed poorly during the market's 
two-year rally, and his forecast is for stock prices in general to go lower. 
"If they were weak in a strong environment, they'll be weaker in a weak 
environment," he says.

CHINA'S OUTPUT TAKES FIRST DROP IN YEARS; FURTHER UNREST FEARED

China's industrial output plunged in October in what was possibly the first 
fall in 10 years, and Western analysts say the government is risking further 
unrest with its economic austerity program. 
</P>
<P>
From traditional heavy industries in the northeast to some normally prosperous 
coastal regions, production has fallen because of shortages of money, energy 
and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures released last week show that industrial output last month fell 
2.1% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts said the fall was possibly the first monthly drop since China 
launched economic reforms in the late 1970s, and an official of the state 
statistical bureau said it was the first drop since at least 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial output between January and October was 7.7% higher than a year 
earlier. This compared to an industrial growth rate of 20.7% for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be optimistic," said one Western economist. "On production it's 
catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that a Communist Party plenum last week did not mention the looming 
industrial crisis in its final report. "It's difficult to understand how 
industry can fall so much in such a short period. The economy is so volatile," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has forced some factories to cut wages. A Western industrialist 
said the government must be weighing the consequences, knowing that workers 
were major participants in demonstrations that swept Chinese cities only six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, I don't think workers will do more than complain. They saw 
what happened in June," he added, referring to the army's crushing of 
pro-democracy protests in Beijing. "But passive sabotage is very effective. 
Efficiency will plummet. It's a kind of sabotage and will continue to 
escalate." 
</P>
<P>
China's economic plight has been worsened by the West's suspension of loans in 
reaction to the June crackdown and the subsequent drop in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese workers recently said many factories in Beijing had stopped 
paying bonuses because they had run out of money. Rumors were sweeping the city 
that all workplaces would stop bonuses, which in some cases account for more 
than half of workers' income. 
</P>
<P>
Officials recently warned that urban unemployment was set to double this year 
to 4% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
The Western industrialist said workers are aware of the events sweeping Eastern 
Europe and this is putting pressure on the authorities. "You can take away 
their buying power for consumer products. Now you are getting into their food 
money -- that is when people start getting unhappy."

VAN TO VAN COMBAT; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S CHAOS, SOMETIMES, AT LAX AS MORE THAN 30 FIRMS VIE FOR PASSENGERS.

It was smooth going in front of the Los Angeles International Airport one 
recent Wednesday as two Department of Airport officers policed the movement of 
airport shuttle vans in and out of Terminal 1. But once the officers left, the 
usual chaos resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, 12 airport shuttle vans from five different companies descended 
on the passenger island. About half of the drivers jumped out and began trying 
to solicit passengers to share a $10 van ride downtown or pay up to $50 each to 
go to such faraway destinations as Newport Beach. Inevitably, arguments broke 
out as fully loaded vans pinned to the curb battled empty vans still seeking 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure hell out there," said John Taylor, who has been driving vans for 
Supershuttle since 1986. "If you are not fighting other vans, you are fighting 
the (rental car) buses, the hotel buses and passenger cars." 
</P>
<P>
With thousands of passengers arriving each hour at Los Angeles International 
Airport and the relatively low cost of acquiring a vehicle, van shuttles may 
look like an easy, no-risk business. But the proliferating number of airport 
shuttle van companies has produced cutthroat competition, airport congestion 
and almost daily confrontations between drivers at the world's third-busiest 
airport, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Some 30 privately operated van companies with 650 vehicles now serve the 
airport, compared to just two companies in 1971, according to airport 
officials. Competition has increased so much that Airlink, a Southern 
California commercial bus operator, cited the skyrocketing growth of vans when 
it shut down its 19-mile-long airport-to-downtown bus service last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even industry leader Supershuttle, with about 200 vans and estimated annual 
revenue last year of nearly $50 million, is feeling the pinch. Last year, it 
took out a $14,000 newspaper advertisement to tell Department of Airport 
officials that Supershuttle and its customers had " . . . the most to lose from 
chaos and irresponsible practices at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
"We are all having problems with the number of shuttle van companies serving 
the airport," said Rod Ramsey, chairman of the Shuttle Van Assn. of Southern 
California and president of City Shuttle in Van Nuys. "We are a young industry, 
and the potential for growth is tremendous. (But) we have a few bad apples we 
need to weed out." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the complaints, the Department of Airports imposed a moratorium 
in September on new van operators and is considering new rules that would limit 
the time that drivers could solicit passengers during each stop and even force 
van operators to install devices that would electronically track how many trips 
the vans made to and from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much wheeling and dealing going on on the curbs," said Tom 
Drischler, transportation coordinator for the Department of Airports' unit that 
oversees ground transportation. "Drivers spend more time on the ground hustling 
up business than they do driving their vans." 
</P>
<P>
Almost unheard of a decade ago, shuttle vans now carry tens of thousands of 
passengers who used to drive to the airport or relied on taxis and buses to 
transport them. Profit margins for operators are razor thin, typically less 
than 2%, several shuttle van companies say. But transportation experts say vans 
have become popular because they offer a compromise between a taxi, which is 
faster but costs more, and a bus, which is less expensive but slower. 
</P>
<P>
On the airport-to-downtown route abandoned by Airlink, for example, cab fare is 
a flat $26.50 and van service is $9 to $11, compared to the $6.50 that Airlink 
had charged last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you have got economics accounting for the growing popularity of 
vans," said Martin Markovich, transportation planner for the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. "But you also have demographic changes as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Markovich noted that there is a greater percentage of single households or 
dual-income families in which husband and wife hold jobs and, therefore, don't 
have time to transport household members or guests to and from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Another demographic change," Markovich said, "is that most people don't go 
downtown anymore." With urban sprawl, he said, more passengers arriving at LAX 
are going to a wider variety of destinations -- stretching from Orange County 
to the San Fernando Valley. As a result, he said, large commercial carriers 
such as Airlink have trouble filling up a 50-passenger bus that goes to a 
single destination. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, vans operate in a much more flexible manner: They pick up 
passengers by appointment at their homes or businesses (very much as taxis do), 
but unlike taxis, vans may make one or more stops to pick up additional 
passengers along the way. Travelers can hail vans, just as they do taxis, at 
designated points outside airline terminals. 
</P>
<P>
It is this last aspect of van service, however, that has made van competition 
especially fierce in California, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In many states, door-to-door airport vans may only pick up passengers who have 
arranged for the service in advance -- normally by at least a day. But 
California regulators operate under "a very loose interpretation" of what 
constitutes advance notice, said Ray A. Mundy, a transportation professor at 
the University of Tennessee who is executive director of the Airport Ground 
Transportation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
If a customer calls from the airport or hails a van from the curb in 
California, that constitutes advance notice, Mundy said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the short-notice rule can be convenient for those seeking 
transportation on the spur of the moment, it can be frustrating for passengers 
who want to be delivered to their destination in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Stack, a customer service representative supervisor for Los Angeles-based 
TTMC Co., which helps manage van shuttle passenger relations, tells of 
passengers who have been driven around the airport for 20 minutes or longer 
while the driver seeks more customers to fill up his van. 
</P>
<P>
And the Department of Airport's Drischler said his unit recently discovered 
that some van drivers were trading away passengers like chattel to other fully 
loaded vans headed for the same destination because the drivers didn't deem it 
financially worthwhile to make a trip with fewer than three customers. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we found out about it was that one of the passengers left his 
luggage in the van he was forced out of," Drischler said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, such incidents have generated few complaints to regulatory 
authorities, said Ebi Esule, a transportation engineer with the state Public 
Utilities Commission, which regulates van and bus service within California. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that the public feels they (vans) fill a very vital public 
need," said Esule. 
</P>
<P>
The van explosion began in 1981, when the PUC opened up a market then dominated 
by cabs and buses. According to a Department of Airports' study completed two 
years ago, vans shuttled less than 3% of airport passengers, versus 54% using 
private cars and 16% using taxis. (Buses, rental cars and other forms of 
transportation also had slices of the market.) 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, most observers believe that vans have increased their share of 
the estimated 44 million travelers who use LAX each year. 
</P>
<P>
They have been aided in their expansion by the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1981, the PUC granted few licenses to new airport bus or van companies. 
"If there was a bus line that already served the area, the commission would say 
no," said PUC spokeswoman Carole Kretzer. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission changed its philosophy as federal officials continued 
deregulating transportation among the states in the early 1980s. The watershed 
year, experts say, came in 1981 when the commission allowed the Trailways Bus 
Co. to operate along Greyhound routes. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's very open," said Kretzer. "We encourage more competition because, 
theoretically, it leads to better service and lower prices." 
</P>
<P>
Van companies now serve virtually every neighborhood in Southern California. 
One company -- Seoul Shuttle -- specializes in serving Koreatown. Passenger 
rates have barely risen among shuttle operators in the past five years, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But the free granting of licenses to new van operators has upset Department of 
Airport officials and industry leaders, who banded together earlier this year 
and formed the shuttle van association to help lobby for stricter van operating 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
"If they throw this thing open to anyone," groused Mitchell Rouse, president of 
Supershuttle, "they are going to get the lowest common denominator of van 
operator, who doesn't have the burden of having to provide a system to get 
customers to the airport . . . (but) only flags them down at the curb in front 
of the terminals."

SOME RULES OF THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airport officials and some shuttle van operators have called for a tightening 
of the rules governing commercial passenger vehicles to improve passenger 
service and alleviate confusion and congestion at the airport. Here are a few 
of the most frequently abused rules of the Los Angeles Department of Airports 
as well as some solutions that the department has proposed: 
</P>
<P>
* Van operators are allowed to announce their destination twice and then 
actively load passengers. 
</P>
<P>
* No more than three vans from the same operator may stop at one time at a red 
curb traffic island. 
</P>
<P>
* Vans may make a maximum of two consecutive circuits around the airport's 
lower level roadway then must depart the airport and not return within 20 
minutes even if the van is transporting only one passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Airports is considering the following rule changes: 
</P>
<P>
* Drivers would be prohibited from stopping longer than 45 seconds to solicit 
business, unless actively engaged in loading passengers. 
</P>
<P>
* Van companies would be required to display a large destination sign atop the 
vehicle -- not inside the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
* Van companies would be required to install $50 transponders that would 
electronically track the number of times a van circuits the airport. The van 
would be charged a fee for each time that it completes the route, thus giving 
van operators an incentive to leave the airport more quickly.

RECORD HEAT SEARS COAST; FIRE DANGER IS 'EXPLOSIVE'; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO'S 95 IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. COOLING TO 70S 
IS EXPECTED FOR THANKSGIVING.

<P>
Record temperatures prompted thousands of Orange County residents to brush 
aside holiday preparations and dash outdoors Sunday as bone-dry desert winds 
whipped up visions of summer rather than sugar plums, shopping or snow skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures soared into the 90s for the second straight day as county 
firefighters remained on alert, wary of what one fire official called 
"explosive fire conditions" in the tinder-dry hills and mountains on the 
county's perimeter. Winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. swept skies blue but elevated 
the fire danger, already considered critical after three years of below-average 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
A brush fire that broke out at 10:30 a.m. near Riverside had charred more than 
300 acres by 9 p.m. and had inched into the Corona-Norco area. A Riverside 
County Fire Department spokesman said some homes were threatened, but no 
evacuations had been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk, quick work by county firefighters prevented a brush fire near rural 
Black Starr Canyon from consuming more than an acre before it was extinguished. 
But more than 150 acres of brushland were blackened in San Dimas and the 
adjacent Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County, and firefighters were 
concerned that winds might kick up Sunday evening and fan the flames. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight day, San Juan Capistrano was the hottest spot in the 
nation. The mercury on Sunday in the mission city was 95, shattering the 
previous Nov. 19 record high for Orange County of 87, set in Santa Ana in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
The average Orange County temperature for mid-November is 73 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler temperatures are expected to return beginning today, with highs inland 
in the low to mid 80s. Temperatures should be in the mid 70s on Thanksgiving 
day with patchy low clouds and coastal fog followed by afternoon sunshine, 
according to WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But few people were talking turkey on Sunday. The weather was the hot topic, 
and San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Lawrence F. Buchheim even took a 
measure of civic pride in his city's record reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I didn't know San Juan had made it as the hottest spot in the nation, 
but I'm glad to hear it," said Buchheim, wryly adding that Sunday's weather 
rivaled the heat often generated at council meetings. "San Juan Capistrano is 
always a special place, and here we've made it again." 
</P>
<P>
The hot weather proved a bonanza at one of the city's most colorful watering 
holes. Bartender Pito Olivares at the Swallows Inn said patrons were "asking 
for doubles. . . . It's hot." 
</P>
<P>
Many sought relief at the beach -- a strange concept for much of the nation, 
caught in the midst of pre-Thanksgiving chill and ice. But the calendar didn't 
stop Tracy Wilburn from "beaching it" Sunday at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous on the sand," said Wilburn, a freshman at Orange Coast College 
in Costa Mesa. "I talked to my best friend at college in Chicago today and 
she's been wearing sweaters since early October. I haven't been out of shorts 
yet this fall." 
</P>
<P>
The turnout on San Clemente's main beach was typical of the assault along the 
county's 42-mile coastline, which afforded crystal-clear views of Catalina 
Island. Marine safety officer Steve Lashbrook said a typical weekend crowd in 
November is about 3,500 people, but Sunday more than 8,000 flocked to the sand 
where temperatures at the water's edge were near 80. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, the mercury hit 91 in Santa Ana, 89 in Anaheim and 88 
in El Toro. Overnight lows have generally been in the upper 50s. 
</P>
<P>
A strong stationary ridge of high pressure over the Nevada-Utah border is 
keeping any threat of rain well to the north of California as the jet stream 
that carries storms and cold air from the Gulf of Alaska has been pushed into 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The high pressure also generated the strong offshore flow, sending warm desert 
air through the mountain passes into Southern California. As the air descends 
in elevation, it heats up, so it is actually as warm or warmer at the coast 
than inland. For example, it was 89 in Newport Beach, while Death Valley was 
just 82, and the high in the desert resort town of Palm Springs was 90. 
</P>
<P>
The heat did little to jump-start holiday gift buying, reported disappointed 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
One South Coast Plaza clothing store owner, whose shop is decorated for 
Christmas, said it was so warm inside he turned on the store's ceiling fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly the type of cozy holiday weather to send people rushing to shop," 
bemoaned Ron Werner, a menswear merchant. "I've got snowflakes on my windows 
and it's baking outside. It's like summer." 
</P>
<P>
Werner wasn't the only merchant steaming Sunday. The lack of snow in the local 
mountains and the Sierra has meant a slow start of the ski season for 
retailers.

BEACH ACCESS BATTLE PITS STATE AGAINST CITY OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH PIERSIDE VILLAGE PLAN PROMPTS LEGAL ACTION BY 
STATE OFFICIALS WHO SAY IT WILL LIMIT PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO SHORELINE.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a case with potentially far-reaching consequences for California beach 
communities, the city of Huntington Beach is locked in a legal battle with the 
state over plans to redevelop the area near the city's historic pier. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is Huntington Beach's long-proposed Pierside Village redevelopment 
plan. Pierside Village envisions a landscaped plaza of restaurants -- some 
formal and some outdoor and casual -- on the beach between Main and Lake 
streets, just south of the municipal pier. The proposal is a keystone in the 
city's multimillion-dollar effort to redevelop downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But unexpectedly, the state, fearing that increased development will interfere 
with public access to the beach, has moved to block building of any new 
restaurants, leaving the fate of Pierside Village in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"The state's action caught us flat-footed," said Huntington Beach Mayor Wes 
Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
State officials see the legal battle now under way as one of major significance 
in their attempts to preserve California beach areas. If no out-of-court 
settlement can be reached, the case is scheduled to be heard next March in 
Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important case," said Curtis Fossum, senior staff counsel for the 
State Lands Commission. "The sandy beaches of California are a limited 
resource. . . . We want to make sure that the public has access to those 
beaches and that development does not supplant recreational use." 
</P>
<P>
Fossum said construction of more restaurants on the ocean side of Pacific Coast 
Highway would hinder people from being able to walk to the shore. He said the 
case has significance to other coastal cities that also may be tempted to 
convert public land. 
</P>
<P>
"There is development pressure on whoever owns the (beach) property, but we 
believe that if the land has public rights attached to it, those public rights 
must be protected," Fossum said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Huntington Beach Councilman Don MacAllister said he cannot understand 
the state's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think this (Pierside Village area) is open beach, but it 
isn't," MacAllister said last week at a City Council meeting. MacAllister noted 
that the entire beach area under question already has some form of development, 
ranging from Maxwell's Restaurant, next to the pier, to several adjoining 
parking lots extending southward to Lake Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierside Village proposal calls for several new restaurants on paved land 
now used as parking for beach-goers. Maxwell's would remain; its existence is 
not threatened by the state's action. 
</P>
<P>
But according to city officials, the Pierside Village concept falls apart if 
new restaurants are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income for the City 
</P>
<P>
Gail C. Hutton, city attorney for Huntington Beach said: "All of this is 
necessary to fund the pier improvements and to develop the new lifeguard 
headquarters. The purpose of this new development is to provide the city with 
income to support the improvements." 
</P>
<P>
She referred to public buildings planned near the pier. One structure would be 
a plaza and surfing museum at the base of the proposed new pier. The 
deteriorating old pier, which has been closed since July, 1988, is scheduled to 
be replaced. The pier funding, however, does not rely on the 
restaurant-construction proposal. A combination of public grants and private 
fund raising is planned to pay for the new pier. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton leads the city's legal defense of Pierside Village. Ironically, it was 
her office's routine legal action in 1986 to try to clear title to the beach 
land that triggered the state's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The land in question once was privately owned by the Huntington Beach Co., with 
part ownership by Standard Oil and the old Pacific Electric Railroad Co. The 
city successfully sued in 1932 to gain public easement rights. 
</P>
<P>
But the easement did not give the city full ownership. Instead, it granted 
right-of-access to the land "for public, recreational, park and playground 
purposes and other uses appurtenant or incident thereto." 
</P>
<P>
To gain full title to the land so it could be redeveloped, Hutton's office 
filed a condemnation action, while also negotiating with the owners. Hutton 
said the Huntington Beach Co. and Chevron (the successor to Standard Oil) "are 
public-spirited companies and they agreed to give up their rights." The 
Southern Railway Co., which succeeded the Pacific Electric Railroad Co., has so 
far not agreed, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
One other interest-holder in the land also balked: the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We included the state in our litigation because the title company was of the 
opinion that the state might have some public interest in the land," Hutton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the State Lands Commission notified Huntington Beach that it 
opposes the proposed change in the beach land arrangement. The Lands Commission 
is a little-known but powerful agency that controls all of California's 
submerged lands and its shore lands to the high-tide mark. The Huntington Beach 
land in question, however, is not directly governed by the Lands Commission 
because it is several hundred yards north of the high-tide mark. 
</P>
<P>
But commission lawyer Fossum said the Lands Commission is involved because it 
believes that the public's access to the shore is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"The water area of a beach is state-owned, and if a city attempts to limit 
public access to our public lands, obviously we have an interest," Fossum said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Gray Holt, a deputy state attorney general who is handling the state's 
legal opposition to the redevelopment, said the state also opposes the proposed 
redevelopment because the California Constitution dedicates beaches to public 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is taking the position that this area should be maintained as a 
public beach recreational area," Holt said. "Our belief is that the city's 
easement is inappropriate for private commercial purposes such as valet-parking 
restaurants. Now that doesn't mean the city can't have hamburger stands or 
little breakfast places -- things that serve the beach-going public -- in that 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chodos, the West Los Angeles-based developer of Pierside Village, said 
last week that the building plans include a mixture of small, outdoor eating 
places and two larger, indoor restaurants, including Maxwell's. 
</P>
<P>
"Public access to the beach wouldn't be limited; instead it would be enhanced," 
Chodos said. "Our revised plan calls for a mixture of eating experiences, 
including some cantina-like outdoor restaurants and patios. The plan is very 
much like the public riverfront concept in San Antonio (Tex)." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials, including Councilman John Erskine, have questioned why the 
State Lands Commission objects to the plan, which won the blessing of the 
state's Coastal Commission in December, 1986. The Coastal Commission is the 
watchdog agency over lands extending beyond the high-tide mark. 
</P>
<P>
Holt, of the attorney general's office, said: "For one thing, the Coastal 
Commission didn't know at the time that the city only had an easement to that 
land and that the easement was dedicated to the public. And for another thing, 
the Coastal Commission's permit (for the proposed redevelopment) has now 
expired, and the city will have to seek it again." 
</P>
<P>
Holt doubts that the Coastal Commission will approve a permit the second time 
around. "I think that the commission takes a strong stand on public-dedication 
easements," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A new residents' group in Huntington Beach, called Save Our Parks, opposes the 
restaurant construction. In a fiery speech to the City Council on Nov. 13, Save 
Our Parks member Larry Geisse said the organization strongly supports the state 
in its effort to oderail Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cheering State On' 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, chairwoman of Save Our Parks, said later in the week: "We're 
cheering the state on. This (beach) land is supposed to be used by the people." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members last week said the land will continue to be used by the 
public if it is redeveloped. The only difference, they said, would be a better 
atmosphere and more dining spots. 
</P>
<P>
But Fossum, of the Lands Commission, said that paradoxically, Huntington Beach 
is now trying to privatize some valuable land it won for public access back in 
1932. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach would not be the beautiful community it is today if its 
leaders had not had the foresight to get public access to that beach land back 
in 1932," Fossum said. "If they had done nothing, that land could be full of 
condos and commercial buildings today. Instead, it's public access land. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people of California should be thankful to Huntington Beach for what 
it did back in 1932, when it was not popular to do that kind of thing to help 
public access to the beaches. The city took on an important responsibility when 
it got that public easement. We just want to make sure that the city fulfills 
that responsibility."

4 DIE IN SANTA ANA AFTER CAR SLAMS INTO POLE DURING DRAG RACE

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least four people died instantly in a ball of flame Sunday night when their 
car smashed into a telephone pole in Santa Ana and the gas tank exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Sgt. Doyle Smith said the driver of the car, a light blue Ford 
Maverick, had been drag-racing north on Bristol Street and lost control near 
Park Lane. The Maverick, containing at least four people, burst into flames 
when the gas ignited, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The other car in the drag race left the scene. Police said they are looking for 
the driver of a black Corvette. Police station Supervisor Richard Coberly said 
that according to witnesses, the driver of the Corvette "stopped and watched 
the car burning a litle bit and then split." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10:45 p.m. Police did not yet know the names of the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
All lanes of Bristol Street from Memory Lane to 17th Street were expected to be 
closed to traffic for at least four hours.

PLAN TO ADD PARKING TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider a possible addition to public parking 
areas at Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Under discussion will be a proposal to option about seven-tenths of an acre of 
land at Lake and Yorktown streets, just south of Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow the city to use the land for a parking lot for one 
year, during which time the city would also have the option to buy the site or 
swap land for it. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has need of (an additional) parking lot for public parking and the 
vehicles of the city, its employees and guests," City Administrator Paul Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The landowner, the Huntington Beach Co., would pave, light and landscape the 
site for about $250,000, Cook said.

<TEXT>
<P>
An Appreciation Day has been scheduled Tuesday to honor an Irvine principal who 
received the national award for distinguished service from the Freedom 
Foundation of Valley Forge. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Bedley of El Camino Real Elementary School received the George Washington 
Honor Medal Thursday at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Foundation presents its awards to recognize words and deeds that 
support U.S social and political systems. Local chapter awards also were 
presented to Olympic gold medalist Janet Evans for individual achievement and 
to Los Angeles educator Jaime Escalante for distinguished teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante's work with inner-city youth has earned him a number of awards and 
was the basis for the film "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Bedley, who was the 1985 PTA National Educator of the Year, was named the 
national winner for his belief that "qualified education must focus on core 
issues of honesty, human worth, consideration of others, good citizenship and 
patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
An appreciation breakfast will be hosted by the El Camino staff, followed by a 
general assembly. STEVE BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES IMMIGRATION; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM LAW WAS DOOMED, DENOUNCED FROM THE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County, we care a great deal whether the Immigration Reform Act of 
1986 succeeds or fails. It affects us to the core no matter which side of the 
fence we're on. Those of us who feel privileged to be Anglo gentry also feel 
overrun by people who don't speak our language, don't understand our ways, 
subvert our welfare system, crowd us out of neighborhoods and force our 
children into private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Or we feel the Latino and Asian presence enriches our culture, furnishes needed 
labor at bargain prices, and that the Lamp of Liberty still shines in all 
directions. These motives, high-flown or low-flown, make us care deeply whether 
immigrants coming from their current directions are let in or kept out. What we 
forget is that there are 170 million other Americans who don't care at all. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the Immigration Reform Act was badly drawn and carelessly passed. 
It only affects five states to any serious degree: California, Texas, Florida, 
New York and Illinois. Only portions of those states at that: Southern 
California, coastal Texas, Miami, New York City and Chicago. Other states are 
affected, but their populations are minor. Other localities may feel set upon, 
but they are often places where the sight of any foreigner occasions gossip. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress passes a law 45 states don't care about and applies it to all 50, 
you may reasonably expect the law to have crippling defects. The way the 
Immigration Reform Act was put together guaranteed this. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the bill was assembled by a congressman from Kentucky, which has 
practically no immigration experience, and by a senator from Wyoming, which has 
even less. Both landed on immigration subcommittees because they were junior at 
the time and not very well thought of. (Remoteness from the problem seems to be 
a qualification for architects of immigration law; the McCarran Act was named 
for a senator from Nevada.) The Simpson-Mazzoli bill failed to pass several 
sessions, then was smoothed over for final acceptance by Rep. Peter Rodino of 
New York. He merely put icing on a moldy cake. 
</P>
<P>
The act opened an amnesty window to aliens who had successfully avoided 
deportation for at least six years. Any applicant who had been legal any part 
of that time was disqualified. In penalizing legality and rewarding illegality, 
the act became a novelty in the annals of law. 
</P>
<P>
The act blandly ordered every employer in the United States to monitor his 
workers' nationalities and to open his books to the government to prove that he 
had. This made it the most intrusive legislation since the income tax enabling 
act. It would have caused a march on Washington if it affected employers 
nationally, which it doesn't, or if it were evenly enforced, which it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Congress assured destruction of the act by dropping it in he lap of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS is good at defending the act 
but has neither the capacity nor training to administer it. INS was given two 
months to create regulations governing amnesty, to be applied in six months. 
They weren't ready in two months, or six months, were being revised through all 
of the amnesty year -- either by INS or the courts -- and they are still being 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
So the million-odd amnesty applicants have not been treated equally, and the 
million-odd aliens who didn't apply can hardly be blamed for distrusting an 
agency that had always been their sworn enemy. Nor was the system fair to INS; 
it made no sense to ask a bunch of border cops to run the Welcome Wagon for a 
year and slam it shut again. 
</P>
<P>
More ridiculous was to expect INS to superintend the schooling of immigrants in 
the second stage of the amnesty process, forcing it to devise standards in 
history, language and civics, and to conduct final examinations that affect the 
life and liberty of the taker. 
</P>
<P>
What "outreach" efforts took place, either by INS or community assistance 
groups, missed the Asian population almost entirely. The importance of this to 
Orange County could only be missed by someone who drives along Bolsa Avenue 
with his eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
People with eyes open may perceive that the 1986 act, known formally as the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act, satisfies no one in favor of reform or 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned with civil rights point to the splitting of immigrant families, 
the gathering of Central American refugees into concentration camps along the 
border, foreign-looking job seekers being discriminated against or cheated of 
wages, and a shadow population of Orange County workers forbidden to work who 
must skirt the law or starve. 
</P>
<P>
Those who hoped the act would cause unwanted neighbors to vanish are 
disappointed worst of all. That the act has discouraged the inflow of aliens is 
a matter of serious doubt. The tens of thousands of aliens denied amnesty in 
the county have not gone back where they came from; they were afraid to, or 
couldn't afford to, or have set down roots and have borne children who are now 
American citizens. The persistence of day laborers has led such places as 
Orange and Costa Mesa to adopt cattle-prodding immigration policies of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster, which conceived itself as an English cathedral town, is now a 
prosperous Asian city. So is much of Garden Grove, and as the nations of the 
Pacific Rim loosen their emigration policies, the 1st Supervisorial District is 
already magnetizing a fresh wave of newcomers, mostly illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Even if counting is spotty, the 1990 Census will show Santa Ana with a 
population that is 54% Latino, and the city still being governed like a prairie 
town now has a population-density equal to that of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
So controllers have no more reason than reformers to be pleased with the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act. Is no one happy with it? Oh, yeah, the 
little man who sells counterfeit green cards outside the Bristol Street post 
office.

THEY DECK THE CARDS, BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Lomax hasn't played all season and he may never play again, but he still 
sets the tone for the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
He limps. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Lomax hobble down the press box staircase Sunday, laboring to make his 
way from the Cardinal coaches' booth to the halftime food spread, was almost as 
painful as watching his teammates try to carry on without him. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Phoenix visited Anaheim Stadium, Lomax strapped a brace around 
his aching left knee and dragged his arthritic left hip through four quarters 
against the Rams and passed for 342 yards. That amounted to only a chunk of the 
517 yards in total offense the Cardinals amassed en route to a 41-27 triumph, 
the Rams' first loss of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the arthritis has gained on Lomax and hip replacement surgery looks to 
be a more likely prospect than another NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
So the Cardinals, still groping blindly for a Lomax replacement, go through 
three quarterbacks in their return engagement with the Rams and stumble around 
long enough to lose in a big way, 37-14. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ram company line, this was a tremendous victory, a great leap 
forward in the NFC West race, a return to the 5-0 form of September and early 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
If we can get real for a second, the Rams' seventh victory of the season 
amounts to nothing more than a fixed fight. Phoenix has a disabled list that 
might contend for a wild-card berth, but the Cardinals currently left standing 
comprise the world's largest taxi squad. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Phoenix starters -- Lomax included -- have missed at least one week 
because of injury this year. Eleven were missing Sunday. That's half a team, 
which is precisely what the Cardinals resembled as they flailed haplessly away 
at the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ram Coach John Robinson was moved to empathy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me who's the NFC coach of the year," Robinson said, "my vote goes 
to Gene Stallings. He's done a magnificent job, just in terms of handling all 
the circumstances over there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They're keeping things together when it would be pretty easy just to go into 
the tank." 
</P>
<P>
If 24-0 at halftime isn't going into the tank. 
</P>
<P>
How bad was this blowout? 
</P>
<P>
Ron Brown caught a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green received a handoff. 
</P>
<P>
Timm Rosenbach, the Cardinals' well-preserved quarterback for the '90s, made 
his NFL debut and played nearly an entire quarter, much to the delight of the 
Phoenix press corps. 
</P>
<P>
Ten weeks of Gary Hogeboom and Touchdown Tom Tupa can be tough on a writer's 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Hogeboom started for the Cardinals and, by the start of the second 
quarter, went Hogebust. His second pass of the game was intercepted by Michael 
Stewart and returned 41 yards for a touchdown. His 10th pass was also 
intercepted, by Jerry Gray, and by the time he returned to the sideline, 
Hogeboom was informed by Stallings that he wouldn't be attempting an 11th. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I do?" Hogeboom wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Tupa, the former Ohio State punting champion, replaced Hogeboom and lasted two 
quarters. His 114 passing yards were deceiving -- 77 of them came on one 
completion to Don Holmes -- but his three sacks and one interception weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach went next, taking over with 9:40 remaining, and acquitted himself 
fairly well against the Rams' second defense. The rookie from Washington State 
completed seven of 14 passes for 81 yards and drove the Cardinals to their 
second touchdown, which made the final score a bit more palatable for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But a mismatch is a mismatch is a mismatch, and any Ram attempt at 
rationalization rang coldly hollow. Beating the Cardinals, the team in the Red 
Cross colors, should be construed as no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
The big deal comes next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Rams take their wild-card credentials to wild New Orleans for this 
season's second meeting with the Saints. The first was a blue and gold 
disaster, a 40-21 trouncing that marked the midpoint in the Rams' four-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Rams have won two in a row and have climbed back to 7-4, tying them 
with Philadelphia atop the NFC wild-card standings. But just a notch back, at 
6-5, is New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
And we know what the Rams historically tend to do in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"A crucial, crucial game," Robinson said. "At this time of year, coming to the 
end of the season, everyone's looking over their shoulder. I think the Saints 
are very strong contenders for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
"They kicked the heck out of us last time. We played our poorest game of the 
year against them. I'm looking forward to playing them again." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as wide receiver Henry Ellard says it, "We'd like to go down there and 
return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
And, two weeks after that, the Rams get San Francisco at home on a Monday night 
. . . and, hey, the 49ers lost Sunday . . . and now the Rams are back to within 
two games . . . and if they can just close the gap to one game by Dec. 10 . . . 
</P>
<P>
There, there. Can we get a grip, please? 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix today does not translate into NFC West title tomorrow. It's easy to get 
carried away if one forgets that the Cardinals' best players were carried off 
the field long before the Rams got to them. 
</P>
<P>
Before considering the Super Bowl ramifications, the Rams should first consider 
the competition. Beat a whole team, then pop off.

LOWLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia kicker Steve DeLine missed field goal attempts from 45 yards, 32 
yards and 45 yards against the Minnesota Vikings. Things got so bad that in the 
second half, with fourth and 15 on the 31, Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan decided to 
keep DeLine on the sideline and go for it. The Eagles, who eventually won, 
10-9, turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't much better for Minnesota, which had 10 penalties for 74 yards 
and turned the ball over four times. 
</P>
<P>
With four seconds remaining in regulation, Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery 
missed two field goal attempts, first from 45 yards and then from 39 after a 
penalty, to leave the Chiefs and Cleveland Browns tied, 10-10. He then was 
short on a 47-yarder with three seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns limited the Chiefs' Christian Okoye, the NFL's leading rusher, to 40 
yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
For the offensive-minded fan, the Cleveland and Kansas City offenses had little 
to offer. The Browns lost four fumbles, had one pass intercepted and punted 12 
times, matching a team record set in 1950. The Chiefs had three passes 
intercepted and punted 11 times. The game appropriately ended in a 10-10 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Lions, who led the league with 34 turnovers entering the game, 
ushered Cincinnati to four second-quarter touchdowns by losing two fumbles and 
having a punt blocked into the end zone in a 42-7 defeat. The Lions lost three 
of six fumbles, had two interceptions and gave up 450 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers lost the ball four times on turnovers in a 21-17 loss 
to the Green Bay Packers. The 49ers also were were called for three penalties 
totaling 35 yards in Green Bay's game-winning drive, including an offside 
penalty against defensive end Daniel Stubbs that wiped out a 96-yard 
interception return by Chet Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien was sacked four times and threw two 
interceptions in a 27-10 loss to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers ended a five-game losing streak with their 32-31, 
last-second victory over the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Steve Largent extended his streak of catching at least one pass to 
173 consecutive games. He had four receptions for 39 yards in a 15-3 loss to 
the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons had won three games in a row at home and were trying to make it 
four in a row for the first time since 1980. They lost to the Saints, 26-17. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers' streak of six victories ended with a 21-17 loss to 
Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski threw for a touchdown for the 13th 
consecutive game with a four-yard completion to Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Scott Norwood has kicked 114 consecutive extra points and has scored 
in a club-record 57 consecutive games. He had three extra points and a field 
goal in 33-24 loss to New England. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's Nick Lowery, who had one field goal and an extra point in the 
10-10 tie against Cleveland, has kicked 193 consecutive extra points, longest 
active streak in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana ran his club-record string of passes 
without being intercepted to 149 before Chuck Cecil made an interception in the 
second quarter of Green Bay's victory. 
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City quarterback Steve Pelluer was knocked out of the game in the first 
quarter when he suffered a sprained knee on a sack by the Cleveland Browns' 
Anthony Blaylock. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit quarterback Rodney Peete, after completing five of eight first-half 
passes for 83 yards, left the game against the Bengals with a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati center Bruce Kozerski left the game against the Lions in the first 
half with a cracked vertebra, but Coach Sam Wyche said he may not miss a lot of 
time because it was just a chipped bone. Bengal defensive end Jim Skow suffered 
a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Houston wide receiver Ernest Givins sustained an ankle injury, center George 
Yarno went out with a bruised knee and linebacker Robert Lyles suffered a knee 
sprain. 
</P>
<P>
Raider nose tackle Bob Golic was sidelined with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
MILESTONES 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Kevin Butler kicked a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter to tie 
the NFL record of 23 consecutive field goals set by the Washington Redskins' 
Mark Moseley in 1981-82. It was Butler's 13th field goal of the season. The 
Bears lost to Tampa Bay, 32-31. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Dan Marino moved into ninth place on the NFL's all-time touchdown pass 
list with 213, ahead of Terry Bradshaw and Y.A. Tittle. 
</P>
<P>
In the Saints' 26-17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans' Dalton 
Hilliard scored on a 22-yard run in the third quarter for his 14th touchdown of 
the season, breaking the Saints' single-season record of 13 set by George 
Rogers in 1981.

run his season total to a club-record 13 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Tim McGee caught 11 passes for a regular-season Bengal record in a 
42-7 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham rushed for 18 yards against the Vikings to 
give him 2,269 yards for his career. That moved him ahead of Terry Bradshaw and 
Roger Staubach into sixth place on the all-time rushing list for quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A ROOKIE MISTAKE? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Burt Grossman had fun insulting the Pittsburgh Steelers all week, 
but the Steelers had the last laugh after a 20-17 victory over the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, a rookie defensive end from the University of Pittsburgh, took verbal 
shots at several Steelers during a conference call with reporters last week. He 
made fun of ex-Pitt teammates Jerry Olsavsky and Tom Ricketts and expressed his 
dislike for running back Tim Worley, the Steelers' first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat their butts so now he looks like the stupid one or whatever he called 
me," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman was selected in the draft after Worley and says Worley should have 
signed for more money. Grossman said during the week: "I don't like Worley and 
I never really did. He screwed me up on my contract thing. Watching him on 
films, he hasn't done much." 
</P>
<P>
PROMISES, PROMISES 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota-Philadelphia game showed early promise of becoming one of those 
games really worth watching when Herschel Walker returned the opening kickoff 
93 yards for a touchdown. Turns out it was worth watching, but only after the 
teams bumbled their way to an exciting finish. Viking kicker Rich Karlis gave 
an indication of how things were about to change when he missed the extra-point 
attempt after Walker's return. Karlis, who was battling the flu, also missed on 
a 37-yard field goal attempt in the third quarter. Eagle kicker Steve DeLine, 
signed three weeks ago, managed to kick a 34-yard field goal but missed three 
other attempts. Neither team, particularly the Vikings, seemed capable of 
winning this one. Rick Fenney's fumble deep in Eagle territory in the fourth 
quarter ended a drive that could have put the game away for the Vikings. Walker 
later dropped the ball when he was simply trying to switch hands, to end 
another threat. Minnesota had 10 penalties for 74 yards. Finally, Randall 
Cunningham threw three yards for a touchdown to Cris Carter with 2:32 left to 
tie the score, 9-9. And DeLine barely made the extra point, the line-drive kick 
narrowly getting over the crossbar. The touchdown, the first by the 
Philadelphia offense in eight quarters, was set up by Walker's fumble. 
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys on Dan Marino of the Miami 
Dolphins: "Marino is a great player and believe me I took some mental notes, 
particularly on those 'Hail Mary' throws. He's in a class by himself." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Boomer Esiason of the Cincinnati Bengals, who completed 30 of 39 
passes for 399 yards: "I was 30 for 39, but I felt it could have been 35 for 
39. It could have been worse than it was for them. They played a lot of zone. 
They didn't want to match up with us (man-for-man)." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Lion Coach Wayne Fontes, after the 42-7 loss to the Bengals: "We got 
beat ugly. They didn't just beat us, they embarrassed us." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans Saint quarterback Bobby Hebert on Dalton Hilliard, who ran for 158 
yards and a touchdown against Atlanta: "He's not little, he's short. Our 
nickname for him is 'Little Rock' because he's solid as a rock. He's just short 
in stature, not in playing ability." 
</P>
<P>
Saint linebacker Pat Swilling on Atlanta rookie Deion Sanders, who was 
penalized with a personal foul for shoving running back Hilliard out of bounds 
after a touchdown: "I think that fired us up. Dalton got a little upset and you 
don't often see Dalton upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan, on the Eagles' excruciating, 10-9 victory over 
the Vikings: "I thought somehow we'd pull it out. I just didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia kicker Steve DeLine, who missed three field goal attempts and 
narrowly made the extra point kick that gave the Eagles their 10-9 victory: 
"The extra point was line-drive shaky. Everything was shaky today. It was just 
a bad day. Thank God it went over." 
</P>
<P>
Bengal receiver Tim McGee, who caught 11 passes for 194 yards against the 
Lions, on the Detroit secondary: "They gave me a lot of room off the ball. We 
hit 'em short, hit 'em medium, and hit 'em long once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle quarterback Kelly Stouffer, on the New York Giants' defense that held 
the Seahawks to a field goal in a 15-3 loss: "They played basic defense, but 
the people they have playing it aren't basic people. I felt good, but there 
were times I just wasn't able to do the things I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak came off the bench and threw three touchdown passes in the last 
4:27 to give the Chicago Bears a 31-29 lead over Tampa Bay. He threw to Ron 
Morris on a 58-yard touchdown play and connected with Wendell Davis on scoring 
plays of 26 and 58 yards. Tomczak completed six of seven passes for 156 yards. 
But Donald Igwebuike's fourth field goal, of 28 yards, as time expired gave the 
Buccaneers a 32-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Dan Marino threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Andre Brown, who 
out-jumped five defenders, at the end of the first half to cut the Dolphins' 
deficit against the Dallas Cowboys to 14-10. The Cowboys went on to win, 17-14, 
and moved into a share of first place with Buffalo in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie cornerback Maurice Hurst intercepted a pass by Jim Kelly and returned it 
16 yards for a touchdown with 2:49 left as the New England Patriots erased a 
24-13 deficit with 20 points in the last eight minutes and beat the Buffalo 
Bills, 33-24. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stewart had a 41-yard interception return for a touchdown on the third 
play from scrimmage and Jerry Gray had two interceptions and Cliff Hicks added 
one for the Rams, who routed Phoenix 37-14. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot rookie Patrick Egu ran 15 yards for a touchdown on his first NFL rush. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis' Eric Dickerson became the first runner this season to gain more

bothered most of the season by a sore hamstring, rushed for 131 yards and one 
touchdown in 31 carries.

TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
Denver at Washington, 6 p.m., PST -- It's being billed as a rematch of the 1988 
Super Bowl, but the Redskins and Broncos have undergone wholesale changes since 
that game at San Diego nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Williams, Timmy Smith, Dexter Manley and the majority of the Redskin 
defense will be watching from the sideline or on national television when the 
teams meet at RFK Stadium for the first time since the Redskins broke 19 Super 
Bowl records and tied 10 in a 42-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who threw for four touchdowns and 340 yards and was selected the 
game's most valuable player, has been sidelined because of a bad back. Smith, 
who set a Super Bowl record with 204 rushing yards, is out of the league, and 
Jeff Bostic is the only player still starting on an offensive line that blew 
away the Broncos with a 35-point second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Manley had 1 1/2 sacks as the Redskins frustrated Denver quarterback John Elway 
into a 14-for-38 game. But Manley no longer is a factor, having sacked himself. 
He was banned from the NFL for life after violating the league's 
substance-abuse policy for a third time. He will be replaced by Markus Koch. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Barry Wilburn, who intercepted two Elway passes, has been 
suspended for cocaine use. Darrell Green is injured, so the Redskins will start 
two rookies cornerbacks, Anthony Johnson and Martin Mayhew. The Redskins have 
struggled to a 5-5 record. Denver is 8-2.

ELLARD DISPLAYS HIS FORWARD-FLIP FORM, EXECUTES A PERFECT '10'

<P>
Sure, Henry Ellard has caught 61 passes for 1,176 yards and eight touchdowns, 
but until Sunday's game against the Phoenix Cardinals, there was a void in his 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And then, late in the fourth quarter, Ellard caught a Jim Everett pass across 
the middle and ran in for a 42-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And Ellard kept running, and running . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Man, what are you doing?' " receiver Ron Brown said. "He said, 'I'm 
going to flip.' So I backed off and said, 'Be my guest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ellard accepted the invitation, and executed an impressive forward flip, a 
signature move that had been lacking from his repertoire this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it was a 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0," Ellard said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone quipped that the East German judge was probably to blame for the 8.5 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, however, was much more generous. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a 10, definitely," he said. "He had a nice tuck, good height on the 
jump and a good landing. I was impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, known more for his kickoff returns, got his first and second receptions 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got so many good receivers on this team that you've kind of got to wait 
your turn," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could flip if he scored, Brown said, yes, but, "that's Henry's 
thing, I wouldn't want to cut in." 
</P>
<P>
Proving once again to be one of the most misleading statistics in football, the 
Rams throttled Phoenix, 37-14, but beat the Cardinals in time of possession by 
less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had the ball for 30:26; the Cardinals 29:34. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Timm Rosenbach, a rookie picked by the Cardinals in the 
supplemental draft from Washington State, made his first appearance in an NFL 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was either going to happen in a game that we were blowing someone 
out, or in one that we were getting blown out," Rosenbach said. "It's 
unfortunate it had to happen under these circumstances, but I was glad to get 
the experience." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach said he was nervous before taking his first snap early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shaking like crazy, I'm still shaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach was so pumped for the chance, that on his first pass attempt, he 
overthrew receiver Ernie Jones by about 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit with a pretty good lick on that play," Rosenbach said. "It was like, 
'Welcome to the NFL.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach settled down enough to have a pretty good quarter. He completed seven 
of 14 passes for 81 yards and guided the Cardinals on a 51-yard touchdown 
drive. He completed three passes for 50 yards, was sacked once for a loss of 
11, and ran once for eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just running around like a chicken with his head cut off," Rosenbach 
said. "I was trying to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach's poultry performance did rank him with running back Tony Jordan as 
the Cardinals leading rusher in the game. Each had 18 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix starting quarterback Gary Hogeboom was pulled by Coach Gene Stallings 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom, who entered the game with a pass-completion percentage of 57%, but 
had thrown more interceptions (13) than touchdowns (10), asked Stallings, "What 
did I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom completed six of 10 passes for 48 yards, but threw two interceptions, 
including one to Michael Stewart, who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
There was Tony Dorsett, who decided after a trip to Paris between his junior 
and senior seasons at the University of Pittsburgh that his name would not be 
pronounced DOR-sit, but dor-SET. 
</P>
<P>
There was Joe Theismann, who went from THEES-men, to THIGHS-men (rhymes with 
Heisman, as in trophy). 
</P>
<P>
And now there is Ram running back Robert (call me Bobby) Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino, who has been called Robert all of his life, said he might as well 
become Bobby since that's what coaches and teammates insist on calling him. 
</P>
<P>
And as someone pointed out, Bobby is a much more appropriate for someone who 
makes his living butting heads.

Q&amp;A: ALAN BERNSTEIN;

<P>
THE PROFESSIONALS' SALESMAN; 
</P>
<P>
HIS PITCH: TEACHING DOCTORS AND LAWYERS THEIR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leslie Berkman, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While doctors, lawyers and other professionals are highly educated, most are 
greenhorns when it comes to knowing how to promote their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 There was once a time when professionals didn't need to know the fine arts of 
marketing and advertising. State laws and the rules of professional 
associations prohibited many from selling themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But that all changed in 1977 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that neither 
states nor professional associations may legally prevent professionals from 
advertising. A new, more competitive era had dawned, and Costa Mesa businessman 
Alan Bernstein stepped in to help. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979 he left his position as director of marketing for the American Heart 
Assn. in Los Angeles to co-found the Practice Builder. With Paul Brosche, 
former vice president of marketing for Bekins, he launched a pioneering effort 
to teach marketing strategy to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's firm includes an advertising agency with a client list of 400 
practices and a monthly newsletter with 10,000 subscribers, who also receive 
free marketing advice over a telephone hot line. The company, which employs 30 
people, also conducts about 22 marketing workshops a year for professionals 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times Staff Writer Leslie Berkman, Bernstein said 
professionals should carefully choose where they open new practices and advised 
that they set goals for the growth of their practices and allocate marketing 
budgets sufficient to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. How did you get into the business of teaching doctors, lawyers and other 
professionals how to sell their services? 
</P>
<P>
A. While I was director of marketing for the American Heart Assn. in Los 
Angeles, a friend of mine who taught in the business school at Pepperdine came 
to me and said he had a Long Beach dentist in his management class who kept 
asking questions about marketing. He said perhaps I could sit down and talk 
with him. So I did and one thing led to another and I took him on as an 
after-hours client. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What did you advise him to do? 
</P>
<P>
A. I didn't suggest that he do anything fancy. Just some basic things like 
asking patients to refer other people to him if they felt good about his 
treatment. And he started communicating regularly with his patients through 
direct mail to remind them about checkups and to tell them about new 
developments in dentistry. He also started advertising in the newspaper and 
using coupon advertising through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
In 18 months we took his practice from a $250,000-a-year business to an 
$850,000-a-year business. This was easy and I thought if I could do it for one 
dentist, I could probably do it for 50. So I left the heart association and 
opened a consulting group in Newport Beach. And we must have been doing 
something right, because within six months we had over 100 clients. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is direct mail to clients and patients an important marketing tool for 
professionals? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. We call it internal prospecting. We generally advise that four times a 
year professionals should send mailings to existing clients and patients to 
encourage repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the content of the mailings? 
</P>
<P>
A. In the case of a dentist, he could talk about new developments in cosmetic 
dentistry such as new whitening agents for teeth. You might want patients to 
know that you are introducing orthodontics into a practice, which is something 
that a lot of general dentists are doing. And there is a new emphasis on 
prevention of gum disease. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the purpose to let patients know that their dentist is up to date? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's one of the very specific purposes. And secondly to tell people why he 
is doing these things. To convey the message that he is caring. Also, it gives 
the professional another opportunity to ask for more referrals. 
</P>
<P>
We also have a strategy to prod patients who haven't come in a long time for 
checkups. We use direct mail, followed 30 days later by a telephone call if 
there is no response. Some people don't go to the dentist or optometrist 
regularly simply because nothing hurts. So we tell people the consequences. For 
instance, that if you are over 40 and don't have an eye exam on a yearly basis 
you could develop glaucoma, which is asymptomatic and basically irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Beyond the relaxing of restrictions on advertising, are there other reasons 
why today's professionals need marketing skills more than they did 10 or 15 
years ago? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. The competitive pressures are greater today than ever before for a 
professional. More graduates are coming out of professional schools and 
practitioners are practicing longer. Basically, supply is out of kilter with 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the competition greater in Southern California than elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
A. My dad who is a retired dentist likes to say that the plate upon which the 
continental United States sits has shifted and the East Coast rose and the West 
Coast dipped and all the professionals rolled to within a mile of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But recently the continental plate rose again on the West Coast and a bunch of 
professionals rolled back to the Midwest. So now you can go to the wheat fields 
of Kansas and find an overabundance of practitioners. Graduates of professional 
schools are beginning to spread out and so it is not uncommon now to find a lot 
of competition these days even in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
We tell clients to look for markets that are less competitive because they can 
be more lucrative. For example, a young orthopedic surgeon decided that the 
Fresno market was too crowded so he went to practice among agricultural workers 
in the Central Valley. After three years, he has nine offices and grosses $3.3 
million a year. I'd say he's doing fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why do professionals continue to open practices where the competition is 
stiffest? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oftentimes location decisions are not made with any kind of business 
analysis. When someone decides to open a practice, really what he should do is 
get a feel of the professional-to-population ratio for the area to see if it 
can support his practice. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It seems that professionals usually want to open offices in wealthy places 
like Newport Beach and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A. They tend to go to wealthier areas because it reflects who they are. They 
tend to be upper middle class in their values and they tend to like to 
associate with other people who are upper middle class in values. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you talk to practitioners who are located in blue-collar areas, 
they tend to report greater levels of satisfaction with their practices. 
Patients and clients in blue-collar areas are easier to deal with. Receivables 
are less of a problem because you have more prompt payment and fewer bounced 
checks. Also, professionals are not challenged as much about what they 
prescribe in working-class communities. They are put up on a pedestal more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you ever suggest that professionals compete on the basis of price? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not normally. The reason is if you are going to be a bare-bones operation 
with lower prices overall, you have to be an extremely good manager because you 
are dealing with high volume and very thin profit margins. Poor service to one 
patient or client can erode a profit margin on a dozen patients or clients. So 
it doesn't make sense for most practitioners who have no background in good 
management to try to compete in that arena. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should professionals occasionally advertise discounts of their services? 
</P>
<P>
A. What we have found is that if you simply promote a discount, you do yourself 
a disservice. Over time the only thing the public tends to know about you is 
you're the deal guy. The allure of it is that it does produce immediate cash 
flow. But it harms your image in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
It makes a lot more sense to promote the non-monetary reasons to come to a 
practitioner. To talk about whether he or she has extended hours or has special 
expertise in a particular kind of technique or caters more to families or 
business people or has in-house financing. But you can also give the reader or 
viewer of the advertising a low-risk way to try a bite-size piece of service. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you mean a free evaluation or consultation for first-time patients or 
clients? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. For instance, psychotherapists and marriage and child counselors often 
will not charge during the first visit, because you want to get to know each 
other to see if the chemistry is right. They don't often promote this, although 
I'd say the vast majority offer this kind of option. All you have to do is ask 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much money should the average doctor spend on advertising and promotion? 
</P>
<P>
A. They've got very poor rules of thumb, which are often set by their 
accountants. Accountants will tell them to spend anywhere from 2% to 4% of 
their gross collections on promotion. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a very poor guideline. The amount spent on promotion should depend 
on the goal for growth that the doctor has set for his practice. Also we want 
to know what his current trend line is -- "is business increasing or 
decreasing?" Then we tell him the budget needed to get to that goal. The people 
we are working with spend up to 20% of their gross on promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I guess that promotion is not as accepted by professionals as it is by the 
retail industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not nearly. But the promotion budgets of the professionals we deal with have 
been growing quite dramatically over the years. The key is that we track 
everything we do so that our clients know what works and what doesn't. Like any 
smart people, they want to go ahead and grow more. And they have developed 
trust in us, so their budgets increase. 
</P>
<P>
It is a lot nicer and a lot safer in many respects for a professional to invest 
in his own business than to invest in something he can't control, like the 
stock market for instance. They are plowing back profits into their businesses 
and borrowing, sometimes taking second mortgages on their houses, to promote 
their practices. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If the public responds to an ad, what will assure repeat business? Doesn't 
it depend a lot on how the professional treats his patients or clients? 
</P>
<P>
A. We can't teach them that. People are intrinsically nice or they're not. They 
are intrinsically happy or not. There are all kinds of small personality 
variables which make people likeable or not. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But isn't personality important to the success of a professional? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's almost everything. People cannot differentiate the quality of a 
practitioner. They read the bedside or chair-side manner as quality. We can 
bring people into an office; we can't keep them there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the toughest market for professionals to promote themselves? 
</P>
<P>
A. The toughest market tends to be right in the middle of big cities. The 
reason is that if you are looking for greater expansion and you have to 
advertise externally there are really very few affordable media alternatives. 
Television and newspaper advertising is too expensive and covers too much 
territory. So you go to direct mail. But direct mail is oftentimes also a very 
expensive kind of medium. Generally you can't do it for less than 40 cents a 
household. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in Midland or Odessa, Tex., you could buy the whole radio market 
for less than one ad in the L.A. Times. We bought inexpensive television 
advertising there for a dental client and, bam, his practice went from zero to 
a million bucks in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Physicians complain that the reimbursements from Medi-Cal are insufficient. 
So do you have physicians coming to you to ask how they can attract more 
private paying patients to their practices? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What can you do for them? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you want to change to a suit-and-tie clientele from a Medi-Cal type of 
practice, you are probably going to have to open up a whole new office. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you mean that in some cases the doctors have actually had to close an 
office and open someplace else to change their image? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, usually what happens is they don't close the office. They open a 
second one in a higher-rent district where they are able to draw a more 
affluent clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can a doctor or dentist attract a better-heeled clientele by refurbishing 
his waiting room? 
</P>
<P>
A. Sometimes. But you have to be careful. I know a dentist near Leisure World 
in Laguna Hills who put a lot of expensive-looking antiques in his waiting 
room. He thought his patients would enjoy it. But he found a lot of people 
started going to other dentists. They thought the place looked too expensive 
and that he must be charging too much. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what did he do? Take all the antiques out? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. You really have to be in tune with your primary market. You have to 
think the way they think. You have to understand their feelings and the way 
they look at the world. If you do that, you will always be successful, at least 
from a marketing point of view.

JOE STRUMMER TO APPEAR AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Strummer may have a reputation for being a flinty sort of fellow, but he is 
willing to take a pat on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, being honored for having put out the best album of the 1980s is more 
like a luxuriant massage than a pat. The editors of Rolling Stone magazine 
recently cited "London Calling," the 1980 double album by Strummer's old band, 
the Clash, as the decade's finest. 
</P>
<P>
Strummer, who plays at the Coach House tonight on his first U.S. solo tour, 
wasn't about to feign cool indifference as he spoke over the phone last week 
from a hotel in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians are really like children, y'know. Of course I would have been upset" 
if the Clash hadn't finished high in Rolling Stone's decade-end album rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor to be in the thing anyway, whatever number," said Strummer, who 
fronted the Clash along with his songwriting partner Mick Jones. 
</P>
<P>
After albums like "London Calling" and "Combat Rock," it seemed as if the Clash 
was poised in the early '80s to become the first band from the British punk 
explosion to reach for the brass ring of big-time stardom. Instead, the band 
fell off the merry-go-round -- the key setback being the falling out between 
its songwriting partners that resulted in Jones being drummed out of the band 
in 1983. Two years and one album later, the Clash was finished. 
</P>
<P>
"Some groups should stay and some groups should go," said Strummer, who 
reconciled with Jones after the Clash had disbanded. "We couldn't really handle 
the mega success, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Strummer didn't exactly plunge back into the quest for 
</P>
<P>
stardom after the Clash broke up. Instead of doing the usual thing -- moving 
quickly to establish a solo career so as to capitalize fully on his successes 
-- he dabbled with sound track scores and a bit of acting, touring the U.S. 
only as a sideman filling in for an ailing member of the Pogues. 
</P>
<P>
Now Strummer is back with his first solo album, "Earthquake Weather," and 
stardom is clearly on his mind: two of the album's songs, "Leopardskin 
Limousines" and "Slant Six," are about the quest for pop fame. It's a quest, 
though, that Strummer is not about to leap into with enthusiasm. Both songs are 
cautionary tales in which stardom is seen as a 
gain-the-world-but-lose-your-soul proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was partly autobiographical," Strummer said of the songs' concerns, "but I 
was thinking of the whole process from beginning to end. The process of fame or 
what you exchange for fame." 
</P>
<P>
In "Slant Six," Strummer portrays a superstar whose inspiration is being 
siphoned by his wealth and fame, and asks sardonically, "What are you gonna do 
for an encore? C'mon baby, after an act like that, people are gonna scream for 
more." 
</P>
<P>
In a "morbid" mood, Strummer said, he might imagine himself in that trapped 
rocker's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really a true situation" drawn from his Clash experience, he said. 
"But it can get like that. I know Jimi Hendrix felt very trapped by the 
audience demands" when he tried to take his music in new directions. "They just 
wanted to hear what they knew. That's human nature." 
</P>
<P>
Strummer isn't trying to buck human nature in his tour with a backing trio made 
up of Los Angeles rockers Zander Schloss (formerly guitarist of the Circle 
Jerks and Thelonious Monster), Jack Irons (an ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer) 
and bassist Lonnie Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"When we play live, we try to mix it up a lot, going back and forth" with songs 
from the Clash repertoire, some cover tunes, and material from "Earthquake 
Weather" and Strummer's film work. "We're still going to play 'London Calling.' 
It's our 'Purple Haze,' you might say." 
</P>
<P>
"Earthquake Weather" takes a musically varied trip through a landscape far 
removed from stardom's more chic precincts. The shifting topography takes in 
slums, back alleys, jazz dives, and remote roadsides where cars idle aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Strummer often adds to that sense of restless wandering with a dense, frenetic 
rush of words and images that recalls Bob Dylan or Elvis Costello. The album 
slows down for a few pretty but dejected ballads and a bouncy but wistful 
reggae song lamenting lost innocence and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
The music has its bright passages (Strummer said that brightness is a quality 
he enjoys in music, naming Paul Simon's "Graceland" as his own best-of-the-'80s 
pick because "I like the way the sun shines in it"). But the overall mood of 
"Earthquake Weather" is as foreboding as the title, with scenes of frustration, 
languor and decay predominating. 
</P>
<P>
A world in trouble is no new theme for Strummer, who sang of Armageddon around 
the corner in the song "London Calling." But he said the title of "Earthquake 
Weather" doesn't come with any apocalyptic connotations intended. Instead, 
Strummer said, it comes from the fact that he experienced four earthquakes 
while recording the album in Hollywood late last year and early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Zander had to drop a guitar quite quickly to get out of the place" during the 
most severe of the tremors, Strummer said. "One of them was really, really 
scary. I just stood there with my mouth open." 
</P>
<P>
Strummer, who has a deep and gravelly speaking voice to match the gruff braying 
of his singing, didn't offer any particular reason for taking almost five years 
before putting out his first album apart from the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984 I stuck my hands together with super glue, and it took five years to 
get 'em apart" he quipped. "I was just taking time out." 
</P>
<P>
He did keep up his credentials as a politicized rocker with a 1988 tour of 
England that was dubbed "Rock Against the Rich." The tour, he said, began as a 
benefit for a British organization called Class War that was fighting a wave of 
gentrification in London that had sent housing prices soaring while displacing 
poor and working-class people. 
</P>
<P>
"What they really meant was Rock Against the Greedy," Strummer said. "Things 
were going mad at that point. The house prices were going through the ceiling. 
The developers had gone amok. There were hundreds of real-estate agents on each 
street corner, and people were really depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Some thought it an anomaly for a presumably well-off rocker to play under such 
a strident banner as "Rock Against the Rich." But Strummer said he hardly is 
leading the life style of the rich and famous that he scorns on his new album. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been very clever about money," he said. "I spent most of my money 
on that (benefit) tour, and my place (a house in London that he says he bought 
with a mortgage when prices were cheap) is the same as any plumber would have." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Strummer plays tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano. Tickets cost $19.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

IRVINE CAMERATA OPENS 2ND SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the religious calendar, Nov. 22 is the official celebration of Cecilia, 
patron saint of music and musicians. Saturday night at St. Andrew's 
Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, the Irvine Camerata opened its second 
season with "A Festive Program of Music for St. Cecilia's Day" and performed in 
a manner to gladden the heart of any saint. 
</P>
<P>
Two major works -- Alessandro Scarlatti's "Saint Cecilia" Mass (1720) and 
Handel's "Ode for Saint Cecilia's Day" (1739) were preceded by Scarlatti's 
ingenious "Mottetto per ogni Santo o Santa" (Little Motet for Any Saint), into 
which is inserted the name of the saint of choice, thus assuring three paeans 
to Cecilia on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hickok conducted with conspicuous attention to detail and perfect 
clarity of beat, maintaining taut but flexible control of his forces. The lack 
of ambiguity in his uneffusive indications granted observers as well as 
musicians the rare pleasure of instant understanding of what was being asked. 
</P>
<P>
Scarlatti's little Motet -- a hymn of praise built on repeated patterns of 
melismas and counterpoint decked out in happy fioritura -- sped by. Not so his 
ebullient Mass, which diligently perks on a bit too long for interest to be 
sustained by its less-than-inspired level of invention. The very appealing, 
slow, quiet "Agnus Dei" that concludes it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
The performance itself, shrewdly paced and judiciously shaped, never dragged or 
sagged. Just two of the five soloists, soprano Sandra Walker and mezzo Karen 
Anacker, possessed anything like vocal strength, but all were refined and 
accurate musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus reveled in the long phrases and contrapuntal chases of Handel's 
great "Ode," and the orchestra did a collective virtuoso turn, with superb 
solos by flutist Lawrence Duckles and trumpeter Alfred Lang. Soprano Laura 
Fries and tenor Bruce Johnson offered style, musicianship and tentative, 
cloudy-toned vocalism in the demanding arias. Handel's requirements of easy 
high notes, clean, clear sound and frequent, articulate trills went largely 
unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Continuo players Malcolm Hamilton (harpsichord), Ronald Huntington (organ) and 
Ian McKinnell (cello) lent the best kind of support: rock solid and 
unobtrusive. McKinnell's solo before "What passion cannot music raise and 
quell!" in the Handel, for sheer warmth and eloquence, was the evening's 
artistic highlight.

REGAN CALLS NANCY'S BOOK 'INADVERTENT CONFESSION' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Donald T. Regan got in his licks today in his feud with Nancy Reagan, reviewing 
the book by his former boss's wife and declaring it to be "a classic of 
inadvertent confession." 
</P>
<P>
In what may or may not be the last word in their ink-splattered battle over 
which one of them hurt President Ronald Reagan more, the former White House 
chief of staff said Mrs. Reagan "seems incapable of understanding how her words 
and deeds might seem selfish, hypocritical and, indeed, even frightening to 
those on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
She and her ghostwriter, William Novak, "have produced a classic of inadvertent 
confession," Regan wrote in a Washingtonian magazine review of "My Turn," Mrs. 
Reagan's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"Very sadly, and most of all, this book gives aid and comfort to those who 
still believe that Ronald Reagan never should have been elected President in 
the first place," Regan said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, Regan, having been fired 13 months earlier, published his 
memoirs. They pictured Mrs. Reagan as a scheming, "shadowy, distaff presidency" 
and disclosed her use of astrologer Joan Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
Last month in "My Turn," Mrs. Reagan got even. She wrote that Regan had often 
"acted as if he were President" and deserved to be fired because the 
Iran-Contra affair occurred "on his watch." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged turning to Quigley for advice, but she accused Regan of having 
"betrayed" a confidential relationship with the astrologer. 
</P>
<P>
Taking his turn, Regan said astrology played a bigger role than Mrs. Reagan was 
willing to admit. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote about astrology because it was an essential truth about the way the 
Reagans operated," Regan wrote. "It was a daily, sometimes hourly, factor in 
every decision affecting the President's schedule. . . . He -- or in this case 
she -- who controls the President's schedule controls the workings of the 
presidency." 
</P>
<P>
As for the larger question, Regan asserted that Mrs. Reagan -- in acidly 
criticizing many of Ronald Reagan's closest advisers, including Edwin Meese 
III, James A. Baker III, David Stockman, Alexander M. Haig, William P. Clark 
and William J. Casey -- "damages her husband and his presidency," Regan said. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," he wrote, "these were Ronald Reagan's choices, made after close 
consultation with his financial and political supporters and friends in 
California; he must have thought that they met his own standards."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200,000 angry demonstrators marched through downtown Prague today in 
the largest protest ever against their hard-line Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in decades major protests involving tens of thousands of 
citizens also broke out in other cities, according to state-run Czechoslovak 
television. The demonstrations were peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters met in central Wenceslas Square, then set out across town for 
Hradcany Castle, the residence of President Gustav Husak, in a noisy, triumphal 
procession for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the end, Milos!" and "Jakes out!" the protesters cried, referring to 
Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. They also called for free elections and 
loudly supported a general strike called by students and artists for Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The march was the fourth major protest in Prague in as many days and indicated 
severe trouble for the Communist government, which until recently had faced 
only small demonstrations. Leaders have rejected reforms that have swept 
through neighboring Communist countries in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not stop the march, but they blocked bridges across the Vltava River 
leading to the castle. Many demonstrators changed course and continued on to a 
major plaza, Old Town Square, chanting "We are the people." Later, they 
dispersed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
The small police presence today contrasted sharply with last Friday, when 
security forces severely beat demonstrators, prompting widespread outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"The bell tolls for you!" the crowd chanted. Some carried banners reading, 
"Democracy for all" and "Red murderers to court." 
</P>
<P>
The marchers jeered as they passed the offices of the Communist trade union 
daily, Prace, crying "Are you Czechs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Here it happened!" they yelled, as they passed the site where police beat 
demonstrators on Friday. Several candles marked the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley cars rang their bells as the protesters passed, and bystanders jingled 
their keys, adding to the noise. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the state-run news agency CTK reported the demonstration 
quickly and in objective language. It noted that protesters "express strong 
disagreement at the action taken by riot police" on Friday. Czech television 
reported 200,000 people along the path of the march. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, students began a sit-in strike at Prague universities to protest 
police attacks on demonstrators, and a Communist leader for the first time 
condemned the bloody crackdown Friday. 
</P>
<P>
East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz postponed a visit to Prague that 
had been scheduled for Tuesday. And Britain summoned the Czechoslovak 
ambassador to protest the police beatings of two British journalists. It called 
the weekend violence "disgraceful and gratuitous." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington today, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said of the 
events Friday: "By attacking peaceful demonstrators, Czechoslovakian 
authorities further damaged their credibility at home and abroad."

The publisher of The People newspaper said today that he has fired its editor 
for publishing photographs of Princes William and Harry that were deemed to be 
"not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Henry, who was appointed six months ago by publisher Robert Maxwell to 
edit the Sunday tabloid newspaper, had no comment on her dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The front-page photos showed 7-year-old William in a pose captioned: "Willie's 
sly pee in park," and a series of pictures of 5-year-old Harry in a tussle with 
schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
Their parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, issued a statement deploring 
them as an intrusion into the boys' privacy and a security concern. 
</P>
<P>
The photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the school the 
boys attend.

A Los Angeles-bound American Airlines flight carrying 165 people returned to 
Logan International Airport for an emergency landing this morning when smoke 
was detected in a rear cargo bin, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers and crew used emergency ramps to leave the aircraft after it 
returned without incident about five minutes after takeoff, said spokesman 
Maynard Scarborough of Massport, which operates the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Four people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation and were taken to 
hospitals, Scarborough said. The 156 passengers included four infants; nine 
crew members were also aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke was detected just after the plane left Logan, and it immediately 
returned, landing at 9:23 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said she didn't know what might 
have gone wrong after the Airbus A-300 took off. "This is a very reliable 
aircraft . . . and is less than 2 years old," she said.

SANTA ANA POLICE IDENTIFY 4 MEN KILLED IN CRASH DURING DRAG RACE

<P>
Police identified four young men today who were killed in a fiery crash when 
their car went out of control during a drag race. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Nunez Gambino, 19, was driving the car with passengers Sergio Padilla 
Orejel, 24; Pedro Carasco Martinez, 23, and Antonio Pulido Arteaga, 25, 
according to Santa Ana police. All were residents of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
All died when Gambino crashed the car into a street light pole and a fire 
ignited the gas tank, engulfing the car in fire. 
</P>
<P>
Gambino apparently lost control of the 1973 Ford Maverick during a drag race 
about 10:45 p.m. Sunday along Bristol Street near Santa Clara Avenue (Story, 
B1). The four men were trapped in the wreckage when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the engine and quickly engulfed the passenger compartment. 
The four victims were burned so badly that coroner's officials made 
identifications by the victims' jewelry, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for the driver of the other car, which was described only 
as a black Chevrolet Corvette. The driver paused momentarily at the crash 
scene, then sped off, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the victims said that they had been playing poker and that Gambino 
had consumed three or four beers before deciding to drive to a nearby party. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the drag race apparently lasted only a short distance -- about a 
block or two.

BUSH BOOSTS 2 PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT, SPEAKING IN ILLINOIS AND RHODE ISLAND, MAKES A PITCH 
FOR CUTTING THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND IGNORES THE ABORTION ISSUE.

<P>
President Bush, with an early eye on the 1990 elections, went campaigning today 
in Illinois and Rhode Island for two Republican congresswomen who disagree with 
him on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The trip occurred one day after Bush cast his third abortion-related veto this 
fall, knocking back a $14.6-billion foreign operations bill because it included 
$15 million in aid for a U.N. population control agency that Bush blames for 
supporting forced abortions in China. 
</P>
<P>
The President made no mention of abortion in remarks at a fund-raising lunch 
here for Rep. Lynn Martin, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul 
Simon in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he made a pitch for cutting the capital gains tax and passing his 
anti-crime and clean air initiatives -- all of which have been held up in the 
Democratic-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke at the $250-a-person Republican fund-raiser, he was heckled by 
members of the audience who shouted criticism of U.S. policy in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman accused the Administration of killing priests, Bush replied: "We 
are not. You be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
He then sought to explain why the United States is supporting El Salvador. With 
that, a man jumped up and shouted, "Stop the repression in El Salvador!" The 
two demonstrators and a third person were led out by security forces, and the 
crowd applauded. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, who's next?" the President joked. "I'm here to talk about Lynn. This is 
not a town meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush went to Providence, R.I., to raise funds for Rep. Claudine 
Schneider, expected to mount a challenge next year to Sen. Claiborne Pell, a 
Democratic veteran of 29 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
He also was helping raise money for Gov. Edward DiPrete, who is seeking a 
fourth two-year term in 1990 as Rhode Island's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, Schneider and two other pro-choice GOP congresswomen, Olympia Snowe of 
Maine and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, met with Bush last Tuesday to urge him 
to modify his hard-line stance against abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Martin has been in his corner on the fight for a lower tax on capital 
gains, which are the profits on the sales of such investments as real estate 
and securities. 
</P>
<P>
"The capital gains battle may be over for this year, but the fact is this: 
We've seen the votes -- a majority in both the Senate and the House are on 
record in favor of cutting the capital gains rate," he said.

3 KILLED IN FRAZIER PARK CRASH

<P>
Two men and a pregnant woman died today when the car in which they were riding 
smashed into the back of a truck parked by the side of the Golden State Freeway 
south of Frazier Park, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, whose names were not released pending notification of their 
relatives, were driving south on the Golden State Freeway at about 55 m.p.h. 
shortly after midnight when their car swerved to the right and rammed into the 
back of an 18-wheeler parked on the shoulder, said CHP Officer Mark Ehly. 
</P>
<P>

Leading Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel said today he had been offered a 
passport to travel to Sweden to accept an award but had declined because of the 
situation in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, an internationally known playwright, told a news conference in Prague: 
"I will not make use of the passport because the situation at home is becoming 
dramatic. I do not want to serve as a front for this regime, which would claim 
they let a leading dissident travel abroad, and thus try to mask the drastic 
repressions we are witnessing."

The shuttle Discovery has only a "50-50 shot" at getting off the ground on 
schedule Wednesday night to kick off a secret military flight because of work 
to complete a booster repair job, a top NASA official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real tight," astronaut Brewster Shaw, the new deputy manager of the 
shuttle program at Kennedy Space Center, said while engineers worked around the 
clock to make up lost time, in addition to conducting normal countdown tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the backlog of unfinished work, Discovery's countdown began on time 
Sunday for a Thanksgiving-eve launch to put what is believed to be a military 
spy satellite in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
As with all military shuttle missions, the exact launch time is classified -- 
NASA will only say liftoff is planned for between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. -- 
but sources have said Discovery's takeoff is scheduled for around 7:30 p.m. 
(4:30 p.m. PST).

Communist leader Egon Krenz today met with an envoy from Bonn in talks expected 
to focus on a West German offer to bail out its Communist neighbor's economy in 
return for moves toward a free market system. 
</P>
<P>
A Communist daily said extremists have urged their countrymen to sabotage East 
Germany's electrical system as a form of protest. And a West German poll found 
that if free elections were held now, the Communists would be in third place. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany has told the European Community that it wants a broad trade and 
economic cooperation accord and wants to start talks on European security 
matters. But it rejected talk of a German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, came to East Berlin 
and met with Prime Minister Hans Modrow to prepare next month's summit between 
Kohl and Krenz, which will be the first ever between leaders of the two states 
to take place in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters met later with Krenz, and it was not immediately revealed what the two 
discussed. East German television said a main question from the East German 
standpoint would be whether Bonn is ready for bilateral ties "on a measurably 
higher level without unacceptable conditions." 
</P>
<P>
East German officials have rejected what they see as West German attempts to 
lure the state from its socialist principles by linking aid to the introduction 
of a free market economy.

<P>
To the applause of the faithful, President Nicolae Ceausescu today rejected the 
democratic reforms sweeping most of the rest of the East Bloc in a five-hour 
speech to a congress of the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling out of the capitalist system . . . is the leading requirement for 
the creation of a just society," the orthodox leader told more than 3,000 
delegates packing downtown Palace Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Many Western ambassadors boycotted the gathering to protest human rights 
violations under Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian leader has also become increasingly isolated in the East Bloc as 
one-party rule unravels in one Warsaw Pact country after another under the 
pressure of popular unrest. Only Albania also remains staunchly Marxist. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu showed no sign today of changing course. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the 3.8 million party members -- about 15% of Romania's population -- 
to maintain the principles of "scientific socialism," instituted in 1965, the 
year he took over. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates, in a clearly rehearsed show of affection, rose frequently to clap 
and chant "Romania -- communism" and "Ceausescu -- heroism." 
</P>
<P>
They were silenced after about 30 seconds by a peremptory wave from Ceausescu, 
who peered out from a huge dais decorated with the hammer and sickle. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers had said 115 delegations from 82 countries were expected, but all 
NATO countries except Turkey stayed away. Reform-minded Communist or Socialist 
parties from Hungary, Italy and Finland also refused to attend in protest over 
the country's poor human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu has encouraged the creation of a personality cult unmatched anywhere 
in the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates leaped to their feet every few minutes today during the speech. They 
clapped rhythmically and chanted other slogans such as "Ceausescu and the 
people," or "Ceausescu -- the Romanian Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's wife, Elena, and their son, Nicu, both of whom are ranking party 
officials along with several of their relatives, gazed impassively from the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance was draped with a banner proclaiming: "Long Live the Romanian 
Communist Party headed by its Secretary-General, Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu."

Just three weeks after a Japanese real estate company bought control of fabled 
Rockefeller Center, another budding New York City landmark, Manhattan's tallest 
hotel, has been snapped up by Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
Osaka-based Royal Hotel announced today it has agreed to pay $230 million for a 
towering luxury hotel under construction in mid-town Manhattan. The price 
includes the land and management rights. The seller is Albemarle 54th Street 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-story hotel, which will have 505 rooms, is scheduled to open next June. 
All of the rooms will be suites, separated into living rooms and bedrooms, 
Royal Hotel said. 
</P>
<P>
Most hotel employees will be hired locally, except for a few Japanese managers, 
the announcement said. United Press International

'80S MISHAPS: MONDALE, COKE AND MINISKIRTS

<P>
Walter F. Mondale, new Coke, Michael S. Dukakis, home banking, miniskirts and 
the Knoxville World's Fair were among the worst marketing mishaps of the 1980s, 
a business magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
"During a decade when knowing the customer became increasingly important, many 
companies -- and even whole industries -- failed to understand their markets," 
American Demographics magazine says in its December edition. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the magazine, published by Dow Jones &amp; Co., combined to select 
the "10 blunders of the 1980s," ranging from "new" Coke to the decade's 
Democratic presidential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Waldrop, research editor for the magazine, said she started the project 
a couple of years ago after hearing a discussion about the influence of 
marketing research versus business instincts in product decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Coke was the first thing that came to mind," she said of the 1985 decision by 
the Coca-Cola Co. to abandon its traditional soft drink flavor in favor of a 
new formula. "But Coke forgot about the giant generation that controls much of 
American business -- the baby boom," the magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
Another blunder was the 1987 effort by designers to sell miniskirts to women. 
"I thought this was ridiculous," said Waldrop. "I just don't want to look like 
this in the job situation." 
</P>
<P>
The decade's Democratic presidential contenders, meanwhile, "based their 
campaigns on the traditional New Deal coalition of blacks, organized labor and 
middle-class liberals," the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
While such Democrats as Jimmy Carter, Mondale and Dukakis continued to appeal 
to the coalitions of the past, Republicans styled themselves as the party of 
opportunity and won election after election, the report observed. 
</P>
<P>
Other business bungles on the list included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Motown sticking with its traditional soul and blues artists and missing the 
rapid growth of rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Knoxville World's Fair. A century ago world's fairs drew millions by 
showing off products and cultures that were unavailable elsewhere. Today 
technologically sophisticated Americans are awed by little. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. lost a major segment of its market share to K mart 
and Wal-Mart during the decade by concentrating on middle-class America while 
the middle-class family was declining. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coleco Industries made millions on the popular Cabbage Patch dolls in the 
middle of the decade but got stuck on that product. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Home banking was an idea that was ready technologically but not in 
consumers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grandparents magazine, a quality product that failed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burger King's "Herb the Nerd" campaign.

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is cutting stockbrokers' commissions for the first 
time in 15 years, the investment company confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
The portion of the commission that a broker gets for selling investment 
products, called the payout rate, will be trimmed by 1 to 2 percentage points 
in 1990, Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson, the country's second-biggest securities firm after Merrill Lynch 
&amp; Co., has been contemplating trimming the payout rate by 4 to 5 percentage 
points over the next four to five years, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
The average Shearson retail broker brought in commissions of $228,000 this 
year, and Shearson paid out 46.5% of the total back to brokers and their 
supervisors in direct payments, employee benefits and deferred payments. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the payout rate is intended to increase revenue at Shearson, 
which is facing a threat from Moody's Investors Service Inc. to lower the 
investment rating on its commercial paper.

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said today it is boosting by more than $800 
million its bid for shares of LIN Broadcasting Corp., which has resisted its 
advances by agreeing to merge with BellSouth Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest offer, McCaw, the country's largest cellular communications 
company, said it is now seeking 22.5 million LIN shares at $150 each, up from 
22 million at $125 each. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said the new offer hikes the value of the nation's No. 7 cellular company 
to about $7.5 billion from its previous bid, which valued all of New York-based 
LIN at about $6.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
LIN is coveted for its valuable cellular franchises in such lucrative markets 
as Los Angeles, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said that as soon as possible after completion of the offer, it would 
cause LIN to buy $425 million of McCaw Class A common stock and distribute it 
as a dividend in which non-McCaw shareholders would receive $16.17 of the stock 
for each LIN share retained. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said it has pledged to pay 12% annual interest to tendering LIN 
shareholders should its tender close after March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said it requested an opportunity to respond to any 
improved offer from BellSouth before LIN enters into any revision of its deal 
with BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw now owns 5,089,500 LIN shares, and the shares it is offering to acquire 
represent about 46% of the fully diluted LIN shares not already owned by McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
A successful offer would give McCaw slightly over 50% of LIN on a fully diluted 
basis, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said if BellSouth should respond to the new offer by sweetening its bid, 
it would ask LIN to put both offers up for a vote at the Jan. 12 shareholders' 
meeting called to consider the present BellSouth transaction and remove 
defensive measures. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said if LIN were to agree to a vote on its offer and a removal of 
defenses, McCaw would agree to extend its tender to the date of the meeting and 
abide by the shareholder vote. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of such action, we intend to take our case directly to the LIN 
stockholders through a consent solicitation relating to the replacement of a 
majority of the LIN board," McCaw said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said its amended offer assumes that LIN will continue with its plan to 
buy the 46% interest in New York City cellular telephone operations now held by 
Metromedia Inc. for $1.9 billion.

C-SPAN CROSSES THE OCEAN TO BRING LIVE BROADCASTS FROM HOUSE OF COMMONS

Cable television's C-SPAN, which has shown live proceedings of the U.S. House 
of Representatives since 1979, on Tuesday will do likewise from a somewhat 
older place -- Britain's House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, which starts with an address by Queen Elizabeth II to the new 
session of Parliament that C-SPAN will carry live at 2:30 a.m. PST, the 
occasionally raucous Commons will open its proceedings to television. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment will last until at least next July, after which the legislators 
in the 650-seat Commons will vote on whether to make TV permanent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that they won't continue it unless there's a major row," C-SPAN 
Chairman Brian Lamb predicted in a phone interview from London, where he's 
overseeing a series of live telecasts slated for this week. 
</P>
<P>
C-SPAN last week dispatched a staff to London for a week of preliminary 
interviews, including call-ins from American viewers. Among those fielding 
questions is John Grist, who oversees the Commons' eight-camera TV system. 
</P>
<P>
For C-SPAN, a nonprofit industry-supported cooperative that says it is seen in 
46.8 million homes and offices, Tuesday may prove a legislative tale of two 
cities, one that enables viewers to see differences in at least the oratory of 
lawmakers in London and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If the American House still is in session Tuesday, a C-SPAN spokesman says, "we 
will go live to the U.S. House and air that in its entirety, then pick up the 
British House in progress. Then, that evening, we'll air the British House 
(proceedings) in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
No video bundle from Britain is scheduled for Wednesday. But on Thanksgiving, 
at 6:30 a.m. PST, C-SPAN will air, live, another Commons session in its 
entirety. 
</P>
<P>
"It might go eight or 10 hours," Lamb says. "It's a good chance for people who 
are busy on Tuesday to just tune in, just look at it." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, C-SPAN will show taped highlights of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The real action -- C-SPAN hopes to show it live -- will come Nov. 28 at 7:15 
a.m. PST, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faces opposition Labor leader 
Neil Kinnock for a 15-minute "question time" session. 
</P>
<P>
Such sessions, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, are rarely sedate and usually rife 
with riposte. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the comparatively tame give and take of the U.S. House, question time in 
the Commons "is meant to be confrontational," Lamb notes.

American rock band Bon Jovi played to the smallest crowd in years at the 
Western Springs Stadium Saturday, just a week after Irish band U2 wowed a total 
of 80,000 fans in two shows. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters blamed the poor turnout on the juxtaposition of the two acts and the 
$25.87 tickets -- an amount beyond the reach of most of Bon Jovi's youthful 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear there was an Irish band here last week that played to 60,000 people. 
Well, we're going to make just as much noise with 15,000," lead singer Jon Bon 
Jovi told the audience.

Zsa Zsa Gabor's age has been a topic of debate ever since she was arrested in 
June for slapping a policeman in Beverly Hills. Her driver's license said she 
was 61, but not everyone was buying that figure. During her trial last month, 
the media listed her as 62 or 66. Now People magazine has found a former Gabor 
schoolmate, Elizabeth Nussbaum of Seattle, who has some documentation from 
their days at Madame Subilia's School for Young Ladies in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. The birth date under Zsa Zsa's picture is Feb. 6, 1917, which 
means she's 72.

MURPHY'S 'HARLEM NIGHTS' TOPS RECORD BOX OFFICE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" led a blockbuster weekend in the box office that 
broke all fall and winter non-holiday weekend records, according to 
Entertainment Data, Inc. Early estimates for the Top 10 pictures are $50 
million, up 43% for the same weekend last year. Despite soft reviews, 
Paramount's "Harlem Nights" grossed $16 million on 2,180 screens -- the second 
highest Thanksgiving / Christmas film debut behind the $19.9 million opening of 
"Rocky 4" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After four weeks in the No. 1 slot, Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking" slipped a 
notch with a weekend take of $8.5 million. Disney's animated instant-classic 
"The Little Mermaid" opened strongly at $6 million, followed by Tri-Star's 
ensemble drama "Steel Magnolias," which grossed $5.6 million on 480 screens for 
a strong $11,303 per screen. Don Bluth's "All Dogs Go To Heaven" (MGM/UA) 
finished No. 5 with $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
In limited release, Orion's "Valmont" -- director Milos Forman's version of 
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" -- opened quietly on seven screens and grossed an 
estimated $100,000 for a per-screen average of $14,285. In comparison, last 
year's "Dangerous Liaisons" by director Stephen Frears averaged $28,150 on 
three screens over the four-day holiday weekend of Dec. 23.

FYI, CHARACTER ON 'MURPHY BROWN' IS NO TED BAXTER CLONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN N. GOUDAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Murphy Brown" has been compared to the old and great "Mary Tyler Moore Show" 
by the critics and viewers. Some have taken the comparison further, comparing 
Joe Regalbuto's character of Frank to Gavin MacLeod's Murray and labeling 
Charles Kimbrough's Jim Dial as the series Ted Baxter, which was played by Ted 
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see Charles Kimbrough get a rise, make this comparison to his 
face. He is thoroughly justified in his annoyance. Ted Baxter was a buffoon, 
even as brilliantly played as he was by Ted Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dial, on the other hand, is a veteran newsman and anchor on "FYI" who has 
probably worked with some of the heavyweights in the field. In fact tonight's 
episode (which airs at 9 p.m. on CBS and guest stars Walter Cronkite) shows 
Dial being roasted for his 25 years with the network. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough's own description of his character is probably the best and the most 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Dial is full of surprises. He is a professional who does the job and does 
it fully. Mythically speaking, Jim sees himself as a laconic Hemingway hero. 
He's buttoned up but highly emotional inside. He thinks he is secure in his 
armor-clad business suit, but he's wary of those closing in on him. He has an 
actor's vanity." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough admitted "Murphy Brown" came into his life at a time when he needed 
it most. Not that he wasn't working. In fact, he was working all the time but 
mostly on the Broadway stage. Gradually, he found that he was playing 
variations on the same role. "Luckily for me 'Murphy Brown' came my way and I 
thought this might do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough recalls the night the cast gathered at exec-producer/creator Diane 
English's house to read the script. The chemistry was there right from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew at that point we had a chance of making it work. Candice was the big 
surprise. The critics fell all over themselves with praise. Candice thirsted 
for comedy. She craved to play a character who was funny and this was her first 
big opportunity."

Masters champion Nick Faldo of England has resigned his PGA Tour membership, 
the Associated Press learned today. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo's resignation came after Masters champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany 
said Sunday in Thousand Oaks that he is resigning his tour membership because 
of the PGA's requirement that members enter 15 tour events each year. (See Mike 
Downey column, C3.) 
</P>
<P>
A tour source, who asked his name not be used, confirmed that the two had 
informed tour headquarters of their decisions and will play a restricted 
American schedule in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Both players applied for non-member status for next year, which will allow them 
to compete in the Masters, U.S. Open, PGA, as many as five other American 
tournaments and the World Series of Golf, if eligible. 
</P>
<P>
They will not be eligible for reinstatement on the American tour for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, a former British Open champion and winner of four European titles this 
year, played in 16 American tour events this season. Langer played in 14.

The troubles facing the Dallas Cowboys have spread from the playing field into 
the National Football League team's business affairs, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have the worst record in the NFL this season. And in recent months, 
the club has fallen behind in paying routine bills and making mortgage 
payments, team owner Jerry Jones told the Dallas Times Herald. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported the team held rookie quarterback Troy Aikman's 
$1.5-million paycheck until after banking hours and is negotiating with a group 
of doctors to sell the Cowboys Valley Ranch headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who paid $130 million for the team last February, told the Times Herald 
that some of the club's bills have gone unpaid for up to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the Dallas Cowboys lost money last year," Jones said. "The Dallas 
Cowboys were not a moneymaker. That didn't discourage me, and I feel very 
strongly that it's a sound business. 
</P>
<P>
"So when the Cowboys need any money for their cash flow, a part of what I do is 
provide that money for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys did not sign Aikman's lump-sum paycheck until after banking hours 
Nov. 1 because there would not have been enough money in team accounts to cover 
the check, sources said. A TV payment was received and deposited the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also confirmed that the team is trying to sell its 80,000-square-foot 
headquarters building and surrounding 28 acres. 
</P>
<P>
William Pestinger, who operates a chiropractic clinic near Valley Ranch, said 
he and his colleagues are close to finalizing a deal.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: LADY ROSE KNEW WHEN TO STOP WAGERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many years ago while researching betting systems, I came across Lady Rose, a 
habitual race track devotee. Lady Rose, who enjoyed wagering on the nags, was a 
delightful, lovable 75-year-old grandmother, a widow who was a happy-go-lucky 
sort with lots of children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who met Lady Rose at the track loved her good humor and pleasant 
personality and eagerly discussed their betting selections with her, arguing 
the pros and cons of each horse, condition of the track, jockeys, post position 
and all the other factors that go into picking a winning pony. 
</P>
<P>
Her race track cronies said that she didn't lose very often. In fact, they 
claimed that she was one of the few bettors who actually made a profit year 
after year. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much, about $10,000 to $15,000 annually, but it came in handy on 
holidays, birthdays and special events when she would deluge her family members 
with beautiful and expensive presents. Sometimes she even had enough money left 
over so that she could take a trip. Cruising was her favorite form of travel. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Lady Rose had been winning with a system that many of today's 
professional bettors are probably still using. It combined money management and 
the ability to come up with one winner a day. But if you think that picking one 
winner a day is easy to do, guess again. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I wouldn't want to rely on my own handicapping abilities to 
consistently come up with a winner every single day. I go to the track for 
entertainment on weekends, holidays and vacations. If I win, it's that much 
more enjoyable. If I lose, it's no big deal. I don't invest a lot of money, 
certainly not more than I can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the easiest way for the average bettor to find a winner is to use the 
selections made by handicappers in local newspapers or in the Racing Form. 
</P>
<P>
Professional newspaper handicappers are paid to come up with winners. They 
follow the horses because that's how they make a living. They receive 
up-to-date information on the horses every day from trainers, owners, grooms, 
exercise riders, jockeys and race track public relations people. 
</P>
<P>
There are very few days when they don't pick a winner. Lots of times they win 
in streaks. For instance, a handicapper on a New York City paper reportedly had 
at least one winner 64 days in a row. Statistically, newspaper handicappers 
across the nation come up with about 22% winners. So you can see that they 
would be the logical choices to follow. 
</P>
<P>
If you're the type of person who wants to have a good time and make some money 
without expending much energy in figuring the horses from the past performance 
charts in the Racing Form, let the handicappers work for you. And if you do 
like to study the Racing Form and make your own selections, then consider 
skipping some races. 
</P>
<P>
Maiden races, for example, are tough to figure. These are the races for horses 
who have not yet won. Not only can you go broke wagering on these neophytes, 
but your coffee bills should increase proportionately as you stay awake nights 
trying to figure out ways to get even. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly 2-year-olds. As the professionals know, they are new to the game 
and are terribly nervous. They'll jump at the slightest sound, they'll run from 
people and they'll even skip over track shadows and flying bits of paper. No 
matter where these "babies" may be -- on the track, in the stable area or in 
the paddock -- they can't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a good idea to also skip the cheap claiming races inasmuch as the 
horses entered in those races are inconsistent, they are not good athletes, so 
to speak, they don't have much heart for racing and are probably not in the 
best physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Lady Rose did it: She relied on the handicappers in her local 
newspapers. Naturally she developed a following for one who gave her the most 
winners. Generally she set a limit of $50 a day. Other players, however, may 
decide they need more money, and others may make do with less. The amount is up 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
She always started betting on the first race. She figured the odds and wagered 
just enough to win the limit she set, plus the amount of money she bet. If Lady 
Rose didn't win the first race, she bet the second, again figuring the odds so 
that she got back the total of her limit, her previous losing bet and the 
amount of her new bet. She did the same on the third and the races thereafter. 
Once she won, she stopped betting. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were days when she ended up a loser. However, over the years, 
her winnings more than made up for her losses. 
</P>
<P>
What the system requires is your daily limit on winnings and the will power to 
quit when that limit is reached. And all that's needed is one winner during the 
nine-race card. 
</P>
<P>
The big question, of course, is which handicapper to follow or which horse to 
bet if you're doing your picks -- a nagging problem for all horseplayers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the new consensus box that appears in this newspaper on all racing 
days and start with the handicapper's choice in the first race. If you had 
chosen to follow Curtis Crayon, one of the three handicappers, on Nov. 3 at Oak 
Tree, you would have had only to bet the first race. 
</P>
<P>
Crayon's selection, Encroach, running in a 6 1/2-furlong sprint, started fifth 
in a seven-horse race from the No. 2 post position. The horse ran third 
entering the stretch, made its move with a rush on the outside, passed up the 
fading Bravest Star and Rayal Prima Donna and won by two lengths. Encroach paid 
$11.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
If your limit for the day was $50, all you would have had to bet was $11. The 
return would have been $64.90, and you would have had a profit of $53.90. Then 
you would have gone home, inasmuch as additional betting that day would have 
risked your winnings. 
</P>
<P>
And if Crayon had lost the first race, he would have made up for it in the 
second, when Esteem Belief won and paid $9. He won again in the fourth with 
Haughty Dancer, which paid $4.40, and finished off the day with his fourth win, 
Radar Alert, which paid $12.20. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Ray, another Times handicapper, won the first race on Nov. 10. Inasmuch as 
Ray's selection, Ono Gummo, was a $9.80 winner, it would have taken a $13 bet 
to win the $50 limit. The total return would have been $63.70, for a $50.70 
profit.

Bob Mieszerski, The Times' featured handicapper, may have caused some adrenalin 
to flow when he won the fourth race on Nov. 12 for his first winner of the day. 
Land Rush, an odds-on favorite, took the lead at the three-quarter pole and 
went on to win the 1 1/16th-mile race by four lengths, paying $3.40 to win. 
System players would have had to bet $150 to win in order to come up with a $50 
profit and to make up the $45 already lost on the day's first three races. The 
total return would have been $255, however, to end the day's betting.

In the first race, Mieszerski picked Native Conquest, which went off almost 
4-1, and finished eighth. It required a $10 bet. The second race found Madonna 
Blue, about 7-1, ending sixth. The bet was $9, for a total loss of $21 on the 
two races. Hollywood Hays, 3-1, ran fourth in the third race. The $24 bet added 
to the $21 made it $45 in losses on three races.

Actually, the faint of heart could have skipped Mieszerski's fourth selection, 
since the race was a maiden run and could have gone on to the fifth race. 
Mieszerski won his second of the day with Super Ready, which paid $5.80 to win. 
And to top off the card, his Ki Nobre won the ninth race for a $6.40 payoff.

Admittedly, a day without one winner would be a disaster. If so, like Lady 
Rose, most bettors might want to put a stop-loss on their daily action. That's 
the key. Just like winning, once they have lost their limit, they quit for the 
day and start over the next day on the theory that it wouldn't take many wins 
to make up the losses. Obviously, Lady Rose did!
