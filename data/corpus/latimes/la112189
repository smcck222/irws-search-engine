MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN LASORDA GETS ROASTED, EVERYONE JUST WANTS TO DIG IN

Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda was roasted during a Las Vegas benefit Saturday 
night for the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the zingers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Sinatra: "(Lasorda) donated one of his old uniforms to the homeless. 
They made it into a tent and it sleeps a family of 12." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Rich Little, mimicking President Bush, said Vice President Dan Quayle 
had been told to fly out on Air Force One to represent Bush at the roast, "but 
when he got to the airport he couldn't remember the number of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Layden, president of the Utah Jazz, on Lasorda: "He's been an inspiration 
to the youth of America because they know if he can make it, anyone can." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Oklahoma and Texas football teams play for the Golden Hat. 
Which teams play for the Golden Egg? 
</P>
<P>
Always a new experience: Earl Weaver's senior baseball love affair with umpire 
Barry Shulman continues. 
</P>
<P>
Shulman ejected Weaver for the second time in 12 Senior Association games last 
week after the former Baltimore Oriole manager criticized Shulman from the 
dugout before the start of the fourth inning of Gold Coast's game against 
Orlando. Shulman went over to the dugout and said, "I'm not going to listen to 
you all night." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver then came out of the the dugout with his cap turned. When Shulman turned 
his own cap, Weaver grabbed it, drop-kicked it, picked it up, twisted it and 
threw it into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-six times I was thrown out in the majors," Weaver said. "Never grabbed 
an umpire's hat. Each time is impromptu." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver's Gold Coast team won, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Get your head in the game: With four seconds left in the Houston 
Oiler-Cincinnati Bengal game Nov. 6, Oiler quarterback Warren Moon tried to 
call a timeout to set up a game-winning field goal. Referee Dick Hantack 
ignored him. Finally, with two seconds left, Hantack called the timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you want a timeout?" Hantack asked Moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, we're trying to kick a field goal to win this game," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hantack told Moon he thought the Oilers had the lead and were killing 
the clock. The Oilers won despite Hantack, 26-24. 
</P>
<P>
Merely a warmup: Michigan State Coach George Perles, on why running back Blake 
Ezor carried 41 times during the Spartans' 76-14 victory over Northwestern: "I 
wanted to keep him in there while he was hot. I wanted to run him and make sure 
that he gets ready for the final game (against Wisconsin) next week." 
</P>
<P>
Ezor gained 228 yards and scored a Big Ten-record six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Child's play: Peter May of the Hartford Courant on Dallas' Roy Tarpley: "The 
Mavericks have gone out of their way to pamper and care for the outrageously 
talented Tarpley, who is Example A of 'body by Fisher, mind by Fisher-Price.' " 
</P>
<P>
Take one giant strep: After Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts fumbled 
three times and lost two against the Buffalo Bills Nov. 12, he refused to talk 
to the press. A Buffalo columnist wrote: "Maybe his throat was sore from 
coughing up the football.' 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mississippi and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
Like a toothache: Brad Lohaus of the Minnesota Timberwolves, on playing for 
Coach Bill Musselman: "He's very intense and it shows. He wants to motivate. I 
played for a guy like him in college, George Raveling. You just have to get 
used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling, now at USC, coached Lohaus at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Alamo: Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka on the performance of 
starting quarterback Jim Harbaugh, who completed 12 of 24 passes for 126 yards 
and threw three interceptions in a 32-31 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
Sunday: "Harbaugh played with courage, commitment and zeal. John Wayne would 
have been proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
Strapped for words: Kansas linebacker Dan Newbrough on the pronunciation of his 
name: "It's New-bra. Like a woman's Cross-Your-Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Sacramento Coach Jerry Reynolds, after watching his Kings outscore 
Indiana, 16-5, in the final four minutes Saturday and beat the Pacers, 107-102: 
"On any team, the talent is so good in the NBA that 10 up doesn't mean 
anything, nor does 10 down mean anything." GARR KLUENDER

ELWAY SICK, BUT ALL'S WELL FOR BRONCOS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: KUBIAK STEPS IN AT QUARTERBACK AND LEADS DENVER TO A 14-10 
VICTORY OVER THE REDSKINS AT WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hyped as a rematch of Super Bowl XXII in which Washington defeated 
Denver, 42-10, scoring 35 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no John Elway or Doug Williams or Dexter Manley when the Redskins 
met the Broncos on a blustery Monday night at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And there was little offense as the Broncos downed the Redskins, 14-10, behind 
backup quarterback Gary Kubiak before 55,692 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as excited as I've been in a long time, because coming into the game 
everything was against us," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
Elway was sick to his stomach. The Bronco quarterback came down with a stomach 
virus before the game. 
</P>
<P>
While Elway rested in the locker room, Kubiak passed for 123 yards and two 
touchdowns. After the game, someone taped the words "Prime Time" on Kubiak's 
stall in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak didn't discover he was starting until late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"John came back from breakfast and said he wasn't feeling well, but I didn't 
think anything of it," Kubiak said. "But about 2 o'clock he started throwing up 
and I knew something was wrong. But I didn't find out I was going to start 
until 5 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak had thrown only two passes this season, and his first two attempts 
Monday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
After overthrowing a receiver on his first pass, Kubiak fumbled as he cocked 
his arm to throw his second when he was hit by Fred Stokes, who was playing in 
place of Manley. Stokes recovered Kubiak's fumble at the Denver eight. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins scored on the next play on Jamie Morris' run up the middle to give 
Washington a 7-0 lead just 1:07 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Without Elway, the Bronco defense needed to make big plays to keep Denver in 
the game, and safety Dennis Smith came up with two of them, forcing fumbles by 
Morris to set up one Denver touchdown and prevent one by the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost Elway, but we didn't lose a step," Smith said. "That's what great 
teams do. We couldn't make excuses because Elway didn't play." 
</P>
<P>
Smith set up the Broncos' first touchdown when he stripped the ball from 
Morris. Cornerback Tyrone Braxton recovered and returned it 35 yards to the 
Redskin five. 
</P>
<P>
After Bobby Humphrey gained four yards, Kubiak threw a one-yard touchdown pass 
to Melvin Bratton to tie it, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak engineered a brilliant 79-yard, 18-play drive, hitting Ricky Nattiel 
with a five-yard touchdown pass with 9:27 remaining in the first half to give 
Denver a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak's best plays after that were two quick kicks that pinned Washington deep 
in its own end. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins had a chance to tie it, driving to the Denver 13 on the first 
series of the second half, but Smith stripped Morris of the ball, and 
linebacker Michael Brooks recovered to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
When the Broncos review the films, maybe Kubiak's two touchdown passes will 
make them forget the one Kubiak threw into the arms of Redskin cornerback A.J. 
Johnson to set up a 42-yard field goal by Chip Lohmiller with 6:57 remaining in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lohmiller's kick cut it to 14-10, but Washington didn't get close again. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Broncos (9-2) have the best record in the AFC, Reeves complained 
that they don't get any respect. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have any more respect after winning than when we had came into the 
game," Reeves said. "But that's fine with me. I can understand it. We haven't 
blown anyone away." 
</P>
<P>
It was a turbulent week for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, Washington's All-Pro defensive end, was banned for life from the NFL 
after he tested positive for cocaine, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced 
Saturday. Manley can petition for reinstatement after one year. 
</P>
<P>
Markus Koch, a veteran reserve, started in place of Manley at right end but 
limped off with a sprained knee in the third quarter. The Redskins used Stokes 
on pass-rushing situations. Manley was the Redskins' all-time leader in sacks, 
with 96 1/2 over the last nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Koch wasn't the only reserve who moved into Washington's starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rypien started in place of Williams at quarterback. Williams threw four 
touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXII. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien opened the season as the starter in place of Williams, who underwent 
back surgery last August. Rypien was benched after he threw five interceptions 
and was sacked five times in a 37-24 loss to the Raiders last month. He had 
fumbled 11 times in 12 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Williams returned, leading the Redskins to a 1-1 mark before he reinjured his 
back last week. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Rypien to face the Broncos, who have the third best defense in the in the 
AFC. Rypien got a standing ovation for not fumbling on his first carry, but he 
didn't make anyone forget Williams.

<TEXT>
<P>
Do you suppose Jerry Buss is happy that he listened to Jerry West and didn't 
make the trade that would have sent James Worthy to the Dallas Mavericks for 
Mark Aguirre and the right to draft Roy Tarpley in 1986? West threatened to 
quit as Laker general manager if the deal were completed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley's lifetime suspension most likely will last a year or two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence that the Rams have allowed only 24 points in the two games 
since inside linebackers Fred Strickland and Larry Kelm were reunited in the 
lineup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson may be fragile, but so are most thoroughbreds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don Shula is back. His Miami Dolphins are tied for first with Buffalo in the 
AFC East and don't have to play a team that has a winning record the rest of 
the regular season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For coaching this Phoenix Cardinal team to a 5-6 record, the fired Gene 
Stallings deserved at least a thank-you note. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Junior Seau isn't the only underclassman thinking about applying for the NFL 
draft early. Others include USC teammate Mark Carrier, Major Harris of West 
Virginia and Emmitt Smith of Florida. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're a UCLA fan, you must wish college football used instant replay. Gary 
Wellman's touchdown catch in the first quarter Saturday probably would have 
been overruled. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only in the Senior Professional Baseball Assn. could Ken Landreaux be traded 
for four players. It happened last week when the Orlando Juice dealt the former 
Dodger outfielder to the St. Petersburg Pelicans for Jerry Martin, Bake 
McBride, Mark Corey and Gerry Pirtle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker, long a household name, will blow out only 22 candles tomorrow. . 
. . The PGA Tour needs Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle and Nick 
Faldo a lot more than it needs Deane Beman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is enjoying the best college basketball recruiting year of any 
school in the nation. It will be interesting to see what Dean Smith can do when 
he finally has some talent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The preseason NIT puts the postseason NIT to shame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most basketball announcers give you everything but the score. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Prized, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf, will take aim at the Strub Series 
and the Santa Anita Handicap now that Sunday Silence has been sidelined. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Six jockeys -- Pat Day, Jose Santos, Angel Cordero, Eddie Delahoussaye, Laffit 
Pincay and Chris McCarron -- already have won more than $1 million apiece in 
purse money this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Every time he works, unbeaten World Boxing Council super-lightweight champion 
Julio Cesar Chavez conducts a clinic in the fine art of delivering a punch. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
It's all relative: Actress Kirstie Alley and golfer Bruce Lietzke are first 
cousins. Unbeaten heavyweight Tommy Morrison is the grandnephew of the late 
John Wayne. Martin Keino, a student at Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia 
who will run the prep mile at the Sunkist meet Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena, is 
the son of the legendary Kip. Members of the Atlantic Coast Conference 
co-champion Virginia football team include the sons of Jesse Jackson, Bob 
Griese, Vince Dooley and Calvin Peete. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nobody in college football has done a better coaching job this season than the 
oft-maligned Bill Curry of Alabama. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Give me one good reason why Maury Wills shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hockey interest in Edmonton has dwindled so badly that the Oilers couldn't even 
sell out the Northlands Coliseum for the last visit of Wayne Gretzky and the 
Kings. . . . Pat Riley has been named one of the 10 best-dressed men in the 
nation by the Tailors Council of America. Among those not receiving votes was 
Doug Moe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Don Chaney, who hasn't had much nice to say about the Clippers 
since being fired by them, called their trade with Cleveland "almost a genius 
move." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Team handball, a truly exciting sport, needs a name change. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among the most interesting postseason balloting will be that for All-Western 
Athletic Conference quarterback. Is it BYU's Ty Detmer or Air Force's Dee 
Dowis? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope success doesn't spoil Don Majkowski, the young Green Bay quarterback 
who handles himself so well on and off the field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I have no beef with the choice of Robin Yount as American League MVP. Nor would 
I if Ruben Sierra, Cal Ripken Jr., or George Bell had been chosen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek on doing volunteer work at the child-care

MISS MANNERS: YOUNG HOSTS HAVE DUTIES TO GUESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN, Judith Martin is author of the new book Miss Manners' Guide 
for the Turn-of-the-Millennium (Pharos Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- At some of our family holiday functions, there are 
children -- including those of the host and hostess -- whose ages are similar 
to my children's. Would you care to comment on the role that should be played 
by these junior hosts and hostesses? 
</P>
<P>
Is it reasonable of me to expect them to play a part in entertaining the other 
junior guests? Is it appropriate for the children of the host and hostess to 
leave the party, leaving the junior guests to stare at the wall while they go 
off with friends they brought to what was supposed to be strictly a family 
gathering, or sequester themselves in their rooms with stereos blaring while 
the cousins make small talk with Aunt Bess and Uncle Homer? 
</P>
<P>
Also, could you clarify the rules for seating arrangements at large family 
dinners, where there is more than one table -- the second being used for the 
dreaded dinner in the kitchen. Who is to be seated at the main table? Certainly 
the patriarch and matriarch of the family. Host and hostess? Their offspring? 
The oldest of each family, until capacity is reached, and then the rest seated 
at the alternate site? The guests, even if it means seating their oldest son, 
who is of voting age, with children in highchairs? This situation always brings 
arguments and complaints. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Indeed, young people do have responsibilities as junior hosts 
for guests of their age in their homes -- regardless of whether they invited 
these people or even like them. They may offer activities as a 
sub-entertainment while the adults are talking, or include these guests with 
their own friends, but they cannot leave them to their own devices. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners believes that your relatives are doing their children a sad 
disservice by not using the occasions to train them in the ways of 
consideration and hospitality. They will be anxious to know these techniques 
when they are old enough to engage in business entertaining, Miss Manners 
promises you. At that point, it will be harder for them to learn how to be 
gracious to people they don't have much in common with. 
</P>
<P>
For the very reason that the younger generation is supposed to play host to its 
peers, the usual table division -- and precedence, when it comes to the dining 
room over the kitchen -- is by age. (This may or may not correspond to 
generations in the family.) Babies are excepted; it is well known that babies 
who have trouble aiming their food into their mouths want to be near a 
napkin-wielding parent. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am enclosing a newspaper clipping in which the parents 
of debutantes are listed as "John and Mary Doe," although the information was 
sent in with the names as "Mr. and Mrs. John Doe." The columnist claimed that 
her editor would not let her publish it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Engagements, weddings and debutante presentations are about as formal as you 
can get, and I have never seen such informal usage. Am I wrong? Has this become 
the acceptable format? 
</P>
<P>
If not, any suggestions as to how to correct this attitude would be most 
appreciated, as it seems to be getting progressively worse. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Newspapers are as much caught as the rest of the society in 
the turmoil resulting from the lack of standard usage for names. Miss Manners, 
for one, can hardly wait until everybody settles down to one system of 
nomenclature, whatever it is, so she can devote her attention to something more 
challenging, such as rocking on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
In the interests of standardizing at least their own usage, many papers have 
made arbitrary decisions that are bound to offend at least some of their 
readers. They would do well, in this period of transition, to follow Miss 
Manners' rule of allowing people to call themselves what they like -- within 
reason, of course. 
</P>
<P>
An argument can be made that giving the parents' full names more nearly 
fulfills the newspaper's job of providing full identities to their readers. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners, who agrees with you that traditional social usage is best for 
traditional formal occasions, would rather solve the problem by arguing that 
such events, however delightful, are not really news and that one need not seek 
or allow publicity to attend them. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am angry at my sister-in-law because, when my mother 
died, she did not extend condolences to me. 
</P>
<P>
We are invited to her home for Thanksgiving. Since my family will be there with 
me and possibly other guests, I am concerned about my behavior. If I act 
naturally, which will be hostilely, I will appear to be cold and rude. I don't 
want to remain at home, as that will upset my young son. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Ah, the opening of the holiday season. Miss Manners is always 
so glad to hear that the spirit of the occasion moves people to anticipate 
reunions with their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
She suggests that you act better than naturally, which is to say, politely. 
This is a good occasion to cancel the year's grudges and give everyone a fresh 
start.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: REMARRYING? ONLY FOR RIGHT REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My first wife, a woman I was married to 10 years ago, and I 
are thinking of marching down the aisle again. Are we crazy? We've both tried 
living with other people -- in and out of marriage -- and it didn't work. We 
finally decided there's no one else we like as much as each other. Will we have 
a better chance at happiness next time? -- K.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR K.F.: It depends upon how honest you've been with each other and with 
yourselves about your past mistakes. If you're both the kind of people who can 
change and learn from error, if you're flexible enough to be able to try doing 
things in a different way, if you're able to take responsibility for your share 
of what went wrong in your earlier marriage and if you both have a lot of 
common interests and want to get back together again, then I'd say your chances 
for success are pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you take stock of personal inventories or if you're both just bored and 
disappointed with your lives at the moment, you will be apt to make the same 
mistakes in the future and the same problems will reappear. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage takes hard work. This is especially true of remarriage because there 
are bound to be old wounds and old resentments that must be explored in order 
to be resolved. Both partners need to be able to forgive and admit guilt. 
Before you remarry, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, not 
because of convenience, finances or to please children. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My daughter-in-law and son constantly encourage my little 
6-year-old granddaughter to flirt with men who visit. They also think it's 
"cute" to parade her around the living room naked after her bath because she's 
so pretty. One night they put her up on the piano and posed her nude while 
friends and neighbors looked on. Is this healthy? Something in me disapproves. 
-- G.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.W.: There's a rather fine line between enjoying, loving and taking 
delight in the innocence and beauty of a child and exploiting that child. I'm 
afraid this falls rather heavily in the direction of exploitation. Children are 
extremely sensitive and catch on quickly to what will win approval from adults. 
I suspect your son and daughter-in-law would be both surprised and disappointed 
if this little girl became pregnant or was sexually promiscuous at 13 or 14. 
However, they are actually training her to be sexually precocious and to use 
her body to tantalize and to manipulate others. 
</P>
<P>
Children need time to be children. Perhaps without knowing it, or even 
intending to do so, these parents are turning their daughter into a sexual 
object.

YOUR BODY: DIETITIANS URGE HOLIDAY DINERS TO STUFF BIRD, NOT THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure you feel stuffed after Thanksgiving. But have you ever dared compute the 
total number of calories you've consumed? 
</P>
<P>
Dietitians have, and it's not a pretty total. The average Thanksgiving dinner 
eats a whopping 7,625 calories. That's about four to five times what most of us 
need to consume in a day. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: You can cut calories by more than half without feeling deprived. 
</P>
<P>
If calorie-counting ruins your holiday, dietitians suggest these simple 
cut-down rules instead: 
</P>
<P>
"Cook the dressing outside the turkey and it's automatically lowers the fat 
because there are no turkey fat drippings," suggests Jody Lander Spector, a 
dietitian at St. Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. "Use broth-based dressing 
instead of cream- or butter-based," adds Bonnie Modugno, a Marina del Rey 
dietitian. "You cut the fat and it still tastes good. Broth-based dressing can 
be as low as 10% fat; typical dressing is 35% or 40% fat." 
</P>
<P>
Don't skip dessert, Spector tells her overweight clients. "Just select them 
wisely. A piece of pecan pie has 700 calories; a piece of pumpkin has 300." 
Choosing alcoholic drinks wisely is another calorie-reduction tactic. A 
six-ounce eggnog with liquor can have 450 calories. But a six-ounce glass of 
white wine has 120 calories. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't set yourself up to overeat," Modugno adds. "Skipping breakfast on 
Thanksgiving isn't a good idea. You'll be starving when you sit down to 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Many Are Ill, but Real Flu Hasn't Hit Yet 
</P>
<P>
It only seems like everyone you know has been down with the flu. "To date, 
there has been no true influenza in Los Angeles County," says Dr. Laurene 
Mascola of the county's acute communicable disease control unit. What's been 
going around? "Other types of viral infections, resulting in brief, minor 
flu-like or cold-like symptoms but often no accompanying high fever." 
</P>
<P>
People at high risk -- along with anyone else who'd like to keep the flu away 
-- should get a flu shot before December, recommends Frank Sorvillo, a county 
epidemiologist. "The best time to get the shot is before the flu season," he 
says. "In L.A. County, that's usually December. It takes about two weeks for 
the vaccine to generate immunity." 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Health Services began its free flu shot program in 
late October for residents above age 55 and others at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
People not at high risk might also consider the shot, Mascola says, especially 
if they often visit elderly parents.

A Baby Beast: CBS' "Beauty and the Beast," which returns to the network Dec. 12 
in a special two-hour episode, will feature the birth of a baby beast to 
formerly-chaste lovers Catherine and Vincent. It is expected viewers will 
understand that the child was conceived during a certain cave encounter between 
Cathy and Vincent in last season's final episode. Linda Hamilton, who plays 
Catherine to Ron Perlman's Beast, is being written out of the show so she can 
spend more time with her own baby; no word yet on whether the on-screen 
beastlet will be a boy or a girl. CLAUDIA PUIG

Soviet Film Makers Coming to U.S.: Eight Soviet film makers have received entry 
visas to the United States to co-produce a documentary in the Northwest about 
aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky, who developed the P-47 Thunderbolt and an early 
helicopter. The project will be co-produced by Oregon Public Broadcasting and 
some of the filming will take place at Boeing Co. facilities in the Seattle 
area. The Soviet film makers are expected to arrive in the Northwest before the 
end of the year. CLAUDIA PUIG

A TRADITIONAL 'BUTTERFLY' IN SAN FRANCISCO

Supertitles can be cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday evening, the translation projected above the proscenium at the 
War Memorial Opera House described the heroine of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" 
as a "delicate flower." A few moments later, Cio-Cio-San fluttered in, and 
looked like the whole greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
To those who insist on visual credibility, Nikki Li Hartliep was at an obvious 
disadvantage. Physically, she simply could not convey the conventional image of 
the instantly irresistible, tragically vulnerable child-bride. 
</P>
<P>
But she did convey that image vocally. Unlike many a sylph before her, she 
floated rapturously to the optional D-flat that crests the entrance aria. She 
caressed and shaded the line sensitively. She suggested sweetness, purity and 
fragility by musical means. 
</P>
<P>
She managed to make "Un bel di" a poignant affirmation of deluded hope, not a 
showy aria. She sang the little lullaby to her child in the last act with 
arching tenderness. In the emotionally precarious suicide scene, she never 
crossed the line that separates pathos and bathos. 
</P>
<P>
Hartliep's voice is not huge. She could not make a mighty exultant impact, for 
instance, at the climactic sighting of Pinkerton's ship. She is too intelligent 
and too resourceful, however, to resort to forcing for effect. 
</P>
<P>
She scored her points tellingly, on her own expressive scale. This was a brave, 
enlightened performance. 
</P>
<P>
The soprano found a sympathetic ally in John Fiore, the young American 
conductor who led this revival in place of the ailing John Pritchard. Fiore 
accompanied the singers carefully, never losing propulsion or climactic stress 
in the process. He conveyed Puccini's passions without bombast, his sentiment 
without goo. It was a considerable accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the protagonist, the cast proved solidly routine. Vyacheslav 
Polozov, the former Bolshoi tenor, turned out to be a blustery Pinkerton with a 
tendency to sing sharp. Gaetan Laperriere, the Canadian baritone, repeated the 
well-mannered, well-manicured Sharpless he introduced to Seattle last season. 
</P>
<P>
Robynne Redmon served as a robustly attentive Suzuki whose voice blended 
beautifully with Hartliep's in the Flower Duet. Douglas Perry was properly sly 
as Goro, Philip Skinner properly menacing as the Bonze, LeRoy Villanueva 
properly dejected and strikingly mellifluous as Yamadori. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, this was pretty much a business-as-usual "Butterfly." At least it 
was a pretty "Butterfly." Toni Businger's decors offer no dramatic 
illumination, but they also offer no distortion. Matthew Farruggio's stage 
direction savors tradition without pausing to think about theatrical comment. 
</P>
<P>
The production, now 23 years old, has served its purpose honorably. It is time, 
however, for some probing reassessment.

NOVELTY BY 'BLACK CHOREOGRAPHERS' AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Icons of refinement began each half of the Saturday program in the "Black 
Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century" festival at the Wadsworth 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
First came San Francisco Ballet principal Christopher Boatwright, dancing 
Alonzo King's "Prayer" (music by Al Koran Alkarin) with his customary nobility 
and a superb mastery of all the solo's surprising inversions and enhancements 
of classical style. 
</P>
<P>
Later on, L. Martina Young appeared in "Oath: State of Recurrent Intimacies" 
(an unaccompanied solo excerpt from her "America Flats"), shaping every mobile 
balance-in-extension, every statement of technical prowess into a triumphant 
victory over gravity, time and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright made his virtuosity look natural and easy, Young forced you to 
consider dancing, moment-by-moment, as a metaphysical miracle. Both helped the 
festival deconstruct limited notions of black choreography in a program 
dominated by pure-dance issues. 
</P>
<P>
Each featuring nine dancers, King's "Untitled" (for the Bay Area-based Lines 
Dance Company) and Donald Byrd's "Rend" (for The Group, from New York City) 
sought to update ballet rhetoric and technique -- King from the inside, Byrd 
from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
As in his solo for Boatwright, King experimented with torso fluidity, with 
conventional classical steps executed from unconventional positions, with 
movement patterns in which control suddenly yielded to raw impulse. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly danced (especially by Marina Hotchkiss), this was highly arbitrary and 
self-conscious choreography -- but spectacularly promising too. 
</P>
<P>
A neo-Armitage essay in Fascist control, "Rend" framed manic solos by Tricia 
Toliver with semaphoric group assaults -- all very difficult and nasty, but as 
much a commentary as a showpiece. Byrd has always tested his audience as much 
as himself and some of his best works have been double-edged. 
</P>
<P>
Lula Washington's "Initiations" (for L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre) began 
like the cell scene in "Petrushka" (a dancer flung through a doorway), 
developed into a "No Exit"-style triangle and used a lot of obvious mime plus a 
little flamboyant dancing to suggest the way deprivation fuels rage, and the 
price that society exacts for acceptance. Washington has a genuine talent for 
characterization and movement expression; none of it was evident here. 
</P>
<P>
Intense, inventive scores by Donald Fontowitz, Mio Morales and Robert Dale 
enhanced the King, Byrd and Washington pieces. LEWIS SEGAL

President Corazon Aquino said she will not be bullied into negotiating with 
Mindanao separatist rebels of the Moro National Liberation Front after Muslims 
and Christians sharply rejected her government's autonomy offer. In a 
plebiscite Sunday, at least nine provinces in the country's battle-scarred 
southern region voted "no" to autonomy, handing Aquino's government its first 
electoral setback since it was swept to power in 1986.

The Justice Department asked a federal judge to grant a two-week delay before 
compelling former President Ronald Reagan to turn over diaries and other 
personal records that his former national security adviser says he needs to 
defend himself against charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. U.S. District Judge 
Harold H. Greene has taken no action on the request. Reagan had been subpoenaed 
by John M. Poindexter's attorneys to produce the records by Wednesday. The 
department's request was filed on behalf of the national archivist. Theodore B. 
Olson, a Washington attorney retained by Reagan, filed the same request.

DEAD ELEPHANT FETUS TAKEN BY CESAREAN

<TEXT>

Veterinarians at the San Diego Wild Animal Park performed the first-ever 
Cesarean section on an elephant, removing a dead fetus from an Asian pachyderm 
that had been pregnant for more than two years. Surgeons spent 5 1/2 hours on 
the procedure on Jean, a 19-year-old, 7,000-pound Asian elephant that was 
believed to have been pregnant for more than 730 days. The normal gestation 
period is between 618 and 648 days. The Cesarean section was performed as a 
last resort after Jean was unable to deliver the 300-pound calf and her system 
did not abort the fetus. "To our knowledge, this has never been tried before," 
said Dr. Jim Oosterhuis, the park's director of veterinary services. "It was 
very stressful. . . . There's a good possibility that she will not be able to 
breed again and even if she were able to, we might not want to try to breed her 
to avoid problems that could occur from this procedure."

Tony Melendez, a man born without arms who touched Pope John Paul II in 1987 by 
singing and playing the guitar with his toes, joined a weekend anti-abortion 
march in Riverside attended by thousands. "Life is so precious. Because of a 
drug, I was denied arms, but I still feel in my heart that my mother would have 
had me even if she had known," Melendez said. Melendez, 27, of Chino, was a 
thalidomide baby. He joined an estimated 6,000 people who lined the streets 
near a mall in a protest organized by the Inland Empire Pro-Life Coalition. A 
smaller group of pro-choice advocates waved banners nearby.

The Sacramento AIDS Foundation is reducing direct services to patients in 
neighboring counties, saying other communities must provide more AIDS care. Sam 
Schuchat, deputy director of the foundation, said the organization will 
continue to provide training and technical expertise in AIDS prevention and 
treatment to health and mental health workers in Yolo, Placer, Ed Dorado and 
Nevada counties. But the foundation's new strategic plan calls for it to save 
its care-management services, counseling, home-health care and one-on-one 
support services for Sacramento County's AIDS patients. The number of 
Sacramento-area people with symptoms of the fatal disease has risen from two in 
1982 to the more than 800 cases the foundation expects to handle this fiscal 
year.

RAMS RETURN TO NFC WEST TITLE CHASE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER EASY WIN OVER PHOENIX, ROBINSON IS TALKING ABOUT CATCHING 
SAN FRANCISCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams threw a welcome-back party for themselves Monday after returning from 
a four-game losing streak to the thick of the race in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Coach John Robinson was outlining his team's chances in 
complicated terms of wild-card playoff spots, all but conceding the division to 
San Francisco. He wasn't exactly limb-stepping then, considering the 49ers were 
cruising along at a Super Bowl clip while Robinson's Rams were praying they'd 
never see another Hail Mary pass thrown their way again. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing the 49ers by two games with five left and the Rams are in the thick of 
the race? OK, maybe it's a thinner race than that, but it certainly beats their 
view from the Minnesota locker room a few weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have already beaten the 49ers once. Of their remaining five games, 
classify two as tossups: this week's battle in New Orleans and the Dec. 11 
rematch with the 49ers at Anaheim Stadium. If you don't think you can win the 
other three -- Dallas, New York Jets and New England, kindly remove your team 
from the playoffs and this discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have four tough games remaining: the New York Giants, Rams, Chicago 
and Buffalo. Throw in one freebie, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are in reasonable shape if they can stay at least two games behind the 
leaders until their December rematch. If the Rams beat San Francisco again and 
sweep the season series, they'd win any first-place ties with the 49ers, who 
close out the season against Chicago and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams finish with the Jets and Patriots. Naturally, coaches never look 
beyond next week's game, but Robinson's outlook has changed from the days of 
defeat and dirges. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be realistic," Robinson said. "To win the division, we've got to 
win the rest of the games. Maybe you could get away with losing one. But I 
think we have to beat San Francisco to win the division. I could see us 
conceivably tying them. Then, if we beat them twice, we would be the 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't he getting a little ahead of himself here? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be led into these things about prophecying the future," 
Robinson said. "I just want to try and beat New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
And that is an imposing task in itself. Not only are the Saints just a game 
behind the Rams at 6-5, they've already beaten the Rams once, meaning a slipup 
in New Orleans could wipe the Rams off the playoff map altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The roads are diverse and unsettled: division champs or home for the holidays. 
What's it going to be? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing realistic for us is just not worry about it," Robinson said. 
"And I'm like everyone else. I go home at night and I make out all these 
charts, and then I lose them and can't find them the next morning, so I have to 
make out a new chart." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gray's great day against Phoenix -- two interceptions, eight tackles, 
four passes defended -- has convinced Robinson to switch the cornerback to his 
natural position, free safety, next season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has talked about it before, but this time he's serious. Gray has made 
three consecutive Pro Bowls at left cornerback, but the Rams think they're only 
scratching the surface with his open-field talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I should take Jerry Gray and say 'you're a safety, even if I've got to hire 
you on the right corner and me on the left corner,' " Robinson said. "Last year 
we kind of wanted to do it and chickened out." 
</P>
<P>
With LeRoy Irvin's skills slipping with age, Robinson was afraid to make the 
move this year and be left with two inexperienced corners, Cliff Hicks and 
rookie Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
But Hicks has recovered from a rocky start to challenge Irvin for the starting 
position, and it might already be Hicks'. Irvin hasn't started the last two 
games because of a foot injury, and getting his job now will take some work. 
Gray was an All-American safety at the University of Texas, and has always 
preferred safety over cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Gray plays free safety in the Rams' pass-defense package, but next year the 
switch will be complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jerry (age 26) could play well into his 30s at that position and be 
very successful," Robinson said. "And I think he will be an All-Pro at that 
position. I think Jerry's a '9' as a safety. At corner, he's not a '9'." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson said Doug Reed's left ankle sprain would probably put him out for 
two weeks, although Reed was more optimistic on Monday. "I think I could 
probably come back pretty quick," he said. . . . Cleveland Gary got six carries 
in the Rams' win over Phoenix on Sunday, but Robinson said it's not his fault. 
"We didn't get the ball early, and I was getting (upset)," Robinson said. "We 
got it and we scored. I know Cleveland Gary is a player. I thought he was 
before, now I know. . . . Henry Ellard now has 5,537 career receiving yards, 
good for third place on the team's all-time list. He's five catches shy of 
moving ahead of Jack Snow into third place on the all-time reception list 
behind Tom Fears and Elroy Hirsch. "Until I'm No. 1, I can't think too much of 
it," Ellard said of his accomplishments.

PLAYOFF SITUATION LOOKS SILVER AND BLEAK; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: ART SHELL SAYS "GREAT TALENT" IS THERE, BUT TWO STRAIGHT LOSSES MAKE 
WILD-CARD POSSIBILITIES A LONGSHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The honeymoon is over, the Raiders are a playoff longshot, whether they admit 
it or not, and a new realism is beginning to pervade silver and blackdom. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his team was whipped in Houston, Coach Art Shell, talked of the 
"great talent" around him, but under questioning, added this qualifier: 
</P>
<P>
"When I say great talent, don't get me wrong. We have great talent in a lot of 
areas. We understand our shortcomings in other areas. But we have enough 
talent, I feel, to overcome the shortcomings, enough talent to win with. We 
don't have great talent at every position, by no means. 
</P>
<P>
"When I say talent -- you've got Willie Gault out there, you've got Mervyn 
Fernandez out there. That's great talent. You've got Howie Long and Greg 
Townsend. That's great talent. Jerry Robinson, great talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying the whole team is great talent, no. We're good enough football 
players to back up that great talent in order to win." 
</P>
<P>
What's gone wrong since they were 5-4? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Beuerlein got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Real bad break for the Raiders, who had to go back to slumping Jay Schroeder, 
providing a window of vulnerability the San Diego Chargers charged through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The defense sagged. 
</P>
<P>
Far more important. It didn't matter how well Beuerlein and Bo Jackson did, 
they weren't going to win anything important if the defense wasn't on its way 
back to form. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three games, the Cincinnati Bengals, Chargers and Oilers have 
amassed rushing totals of 145, 136 and 170 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers ran out the last 4:21 of a 14-12 win on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers held the ball for 39:48 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders say it has come in passing situations and from cutbacks, but it's 
no longer a problem here and there. It's a pattern again. 
</P>
<P>
Are they suffering the after-effects of Jerry Robinson's concussion three weeks 
ago? Robinson rejoined the lineup Sunday and took another hit that shook him 
up. Linden King waved to the sideline for a replacement but Robinson stayed in. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, it's more than one man. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider official says this team is about four quality players away. Figure one 
or two on offense (starting at left tackle for Rory Graves?), and two or three 
on defense, where the outside linebackers figure to get a look, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
Shell says the Raiders' playoff chances are "just as good as anybody else's," 
but he's obliged to strike a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
Two wild-card contenders, Houston and Miami, are two games ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
Houston has won the head-up meeting, so the Raiders would have to finish ahead 
of the Oilers to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins have a soft schedule, with no .500 teams left on it. 
</P>
<P>
If Miami wins the AFC East, the Raiders might have to catch Buffalo (7-4), 
which is also two games ahead, and has a 6-4 conference record to the Raiders' 
4-5. 
</P>
<P>
If Houston wins the AFC Central, the Raiders might have to catch Cleveland 
(7-3-1), which has a 2 1/2-game lead and a better conference record, 5-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are also a game behind Cincinnati (6-5), although the Raiders would 
win a tie here because they beat the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Colts (5-6) have a 4-4 conference record, so the Raiders would 
have to overtake them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The injury report: 
</P>
<P>
Steve Beuerlein says he's fine. Shell says Beuerlein will start Sunday against 
the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Shell says Bo Jackson's twingy left thigh muscle is fine, and he fully expects 
Bo to go. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen, who tore a ligament in his right knee, is eligible to practice. 
But Shell says Allen won't play this week. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' next three games are at home, against the New England Patriots, 
Denver Broncos and Phoenix Cardinals. "We need this right about now," Art Shell 
said. . . . Bob Golic, on going back in after getting knocked woozy: "I lined 
up in my usual spot across from center. Then I looked up and saw Bruce Matthews 
staring me in the face. I thought, 'This concussion must really be bad, I'm 
lining up in the wrong spot.' " Matthews, a guard, shifted to center when the 
starter was hurt.

WELLMAN STILL BELIEVES HE TOED LINE FOR USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked minutes after the game about his controversial touchdown catch in 
Saturday's 10-10 tie between UCLA and USC, Trojan receiver Gary Wellman said he 
thought his leg was in bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Asked again Monday after watching the tape, Wellman was down to his toe. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had no clue when I caught it," he said. "I thought I was in, but I 
didn't realize how close it was. I thought I got my toe in before rest of my 
leg went out and that's what counts. It doesn't matter what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the end zone was painted made it really confusing." 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum end zones were painted red and white for Saturday's game, the red 
part being fair territory, the white part out of bounds. Bruin Coach Terry 
Donahue thinks that may have been the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that may have confused the official," Donahue said. "If it didn't, 
then he just made a bad call. It's real close, but his knee hit out of bounds 
and then his leg hit in bounds. Most neutral observers would say it was out of 
bounds. I guess it doesn't matter now." 
</P>
<P>
It did Saturday. On the opening drive of the game, the Trojans moved down to 
the UCLA 13-yard line, where quarterback Todd Marinovich, spotting a streaking 
Wellman barely ahead of defender Carlton Gray, threw a high spiral just beyond 
Wellman's fingertips. The receiver left his feet, arms outstretched, caught up 
to the ball and crashed down at the right edge of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
In or out? USC Coach Larry Smith, after viewing the game film, says he still 
isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"From our angle," he said, "you can't see his feet. You can't tell at all." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Trojans didn't score another touchdown, the decision was crucial. 
</P>
<P>
So were several others Donahue made in the closing minute of the game, 
decisions that caused some to resurrect the old charges that he coaches too 
conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the situation: The Bruins recovered the ball on a Leroy Holt fumble 
deep in their own territory. On the first play, quarterback Bret Johnson hit 
Scott Miller with a 52-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
That set UCLA up at the USC 36. Three running plays netted the Bruins minus one 
yard, forcing kicker Alfredo Velasco to attempt a field goal from 54 yards. The 
ball hit the crossbar and bounced back into the end zone on the final play of 
the game, leaving the score tied. 
</P>
<P>
"We did call a pass on the second play," Donahue said, "and anybody who says we 
didn't doesn't know what they are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
"The first play (a pitchout to Shawn Wills) got us a yard. The second play was 
designed to hit Mel Farr on a pass, but Bret felt like the strong safety got 
underneath and so he decided to scramble." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson gained one yard. 
</P>
<P>
"So anybody who claims we didn't try to pass was not very informed," Donahue 
said. "SC did a good job of being there on the play. It looked like Bret had a 
chance of getting the ball in there, but the quarterback is the only one who 
can make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
On third down, Wills tried to go around the right side and was thrown for a 
three-yard loss by Cleveland Colter, taking Velasco just out of range, as it 
turned out. 
</P>
<P>
"The play was designed to go inside," Donahue said. "It was never designed to 
go anywhere close to where it wound up. But Shawn saw the defender and thought 
he could outrun him." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue also doesn't buy the argument of those who say the tie was a moral 
victory for the 3-7-1 Bruins against the 8-2-1 Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure there are any moral victories in athletics," Donahue said. "You 
play to win, and either you win or you don't. Being in a situation where you 
have a shot to win and then not being able to make it just leaves you 
disappointed. I'm not into moral victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure wish it hadn't gotten away. One more revolution of ball and we'd have 
won. But still, it was a monumental effort by a team that played really hard 
and competed although we were probably overmatched."

AFTER LOOK IN MIRROR, BRUIN BAD BOY WILSON TRIES TO CHANGE IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rhythmic, taunting chant begins almost as soon as Trevor Wilson steps onto 
the basketball court. It grows louder each time the UCLA forward commits a 
foul, stares down an opponent, fires off a missive at an official. 
</P>
<P>
Treeeeeh-vor. Treeeeeh-vor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson views it as a badge of honor, verifying his status as the most vilified 
player on what may still be the most vilified team in the Pacific 10 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," he said. "It's a sign of respect because they're picking 
you out, keying on you because they think if they can get you off your game, 
they have a better chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, it didn't take much to distract Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
He was a powder keg, waiting to explode, and the slightest provocation threw 
him into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
His mood swings, in fact, were so pronounced that Coach Jim Harrick, who 
arrived in Westwood in the spring of 1988, suggested strongly that Wilson meet 
with a sports psychologist, Dr. William Parham, who works regularly with 
several UCLA athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, in fact, made it a weekly requirement for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Trevor had a lot of energy that he sometimes was using in the wrong 
direction," Harrick said. "He's very highly spirited, which I like, but it's 
got to be channeled in a proper direction." 
</P>
<P>
Except for a flare-up at the end of a game against USC, when Trojan Calvin 
Banks found himself embraced in a headlock by the Bruin forward, Wilson was on 
his best behavior last season, funneling his efforts into his play, which at 
times was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
In earning all-conference recognition for the second consecutive season, he 
averaged 18.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, scoring a career-high 32 points against 
Boston University and equaling a career-best by pulling down 15 rebounds 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, agile and strong -- former teammate Pooh Richardson called him Rock 
because of his chiseled physique -- the 6-foot-8, 211-pound Wilson was as 
tenacious in pursuing excellence as he once was in chasing down officials. 
</P>
<P>
An unsavory image is hard to shake, but Wilson, believing he owed it to 
himself, gave it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"After my sophomore year, I just wasn't happy with my image on the court," said 
Wilson, who is expected to provide senior leadership this season for a young 
but talented Bruin team that is made up primarily of freshmen and sophomores. 
"And then when Coach Harrick came in, he talked to me about improving it." 
</P>
<P>
His image, Wilson believed, was that of a villain. 
</P>
<P>
It was cemented in the minds of some during a summer league game at Cal State 
Los Angeles in 1988, when Wilson raged out of control and refused to leave the 
gym after being ejected. 
</P>
<P>
When an official called a forfeit, Wilson reportedly followed him outside, 
where he continued to berate him and, according to a police report of the 
incident, left two scratches on his car. 
</P>
<P>
It was speculated last season that the incident made Wilson realize that his 
fuse was short and that he might not be able to control his temper without 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, though, said that he suspected long before then that he needed to 
control his temper. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gradual realization," he said. "There were times when I'd pull up and 
say, ' . . . I've got to stop doing this.' (But) a few months later, I'd do it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like it was an everyday thing, but it happened often enough that it 
got to the point where I had to make a conscious effort to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Of his time with Parham, Wilson said: "It gives you someone to talk to. You can 
say whatever you want about anybody you want. 
</P>
<P>
"He deals with how to improve you as a player. Part of that is working on your 
confidence, working on your self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
The sessions, Wilson said, have helped him to mature. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about myself now and, to me, that's the only thing that really 
matters," he said. "If I feel good about myself, I know that I'm doing 
something right. Beforehand, I knew deep down that what I was doing was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson regrets tangling with Banks last season. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one's perfect," he said. "And by no means do I consider myself perfect. 
I do consider last season successful in terms of controlling my emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"That one incident was one too many, but basketball is a game of emotions and 
sometimes you can't control them." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson showed that this month when he fought with Kevin Johnson of the 
Phoenix Suns, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not certain that a leader isn't going to lose his poise every once in a 
while," the coach added. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership is among the many attributes Harrick expects this season from 
Wilson, whose potential is such that Harrick told him last summer: "I've never 
had a guy so gifted who needed to work on so many things." 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among them is Wilson's concentration, which tends to lapse, Harrick 
said, when he's playing defense. 
</P>
<P>
"When he puts his mind to it, our guys really have a hard time scoring against 
him in practice," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson believes that he'll be a more dangerous scorer this season, but that it 
might not be reflected in his statistics because the Bruins are deeper and more 
talented with the addition of a highly regarded group of freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's goals are to provide the Bruins with more assists and steals and to be 
more aggressive on defense "on a consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
Expecting a challenge from freshmen Tracy Murray and Zan Mason, Wilson embarked 
on the season with a more positive attitude and has been the Bruins' most 
diligent worker, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest worker we've had every day, no question," Harrick said. "He's been 
hammered and pushed around and he's taken the challenge to try to stop Murray 
from scoring and he's taken the challenge to fight off Mason, who's kind of a 
bulldog." 
</P>
<P>
And he's done it without a lot of fuss, his teammates say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot more mellow," said Kevin Walker, a senior who has clashed with 
Wilson in other seasons. "He doesn't get upset as easily. He doesn't let little 
things affect him. He's basically just going out and playing and not letting 
anything bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, he'd get upset and you'd lose him for a few minutes before he cooled 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick has been a major influence, said sophomore Don MacLean, who has known 
Wilson for almost 10 years and considers him a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Harrick's not going to put up with Trevor throwing the ball up into the 
bleachers during practice, or cussing everybody out," MacLean said. "I think 
Trevor realized that if he wanted to be part of the team, he'd better shape up 
or he'd have to ship out." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, of course, is aware that one false move could greatly affect his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows a lot of money is on the line," MacLean said. "People are coming to 
practice -- a lot of pro scouts -- and I think he realized that he's got to 
keep a level head so these guys can see that he's really mellowed out." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson believes strongly that he'll be a first-round NBA draft choice "as long 
as I keep myself under control mentally and just show my talent and show what 
I'm capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Game films, he said, have helped him hone his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best way to critique yourself," he said. "You may think you're 
doing something correct, but seeing yourself on film is the only way to (detect 
flaws)." 
</P>
<P>
Watching film also persuaded Wilson to clean up his act. 
</P>
<P>
"I would look at tapes where I would blow up and (see) how I looked in other 
people's eyes, and I didn't like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who watch Wilson this season will like what they see, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see a new Trevor Wilson -- one who's really dedicated to making himself 
a complete player, a shut-down defender, a guy who will play hard all the time 
and let his play do the talking." 
</P>
<P>
And will let opposing fans do the taunting and woofing.

CAL STATE LONG BEACH WOMEN'S PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS ARE FAVORED TO WIN THE BIG WEST AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
She has only one returning starter and seven new players, but Coach Joan 
Bonvicini of the Cal State Long Beach women's basketball team is confident that 
the 49ers will have another outstanding year. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot from graduation, there's no doubt about that," said Bonvicini, 
in her 11th year as coach. "But each year that happens and we come back and do 
even better. . . . We just seem to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers advanced to the Final Four in 1987 and 1988 and finished last season 
at 30-5 after losing to Tennessee in the NCAA East Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
The team is heavily favored to finish atop the Big West Conference -- in which 
it finished 18-0 the previous two seasons -- for the fifth straight year, 
although steady Nevada Las Vegas, with the Jordan sisters, Pauline and 
Geannine, is always a threat. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, Bonvicini's teams have won at least 24 games each season. 
The 49ers have had the nation's top offense -- they averaged 89.3 points last 
season -- for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Having finished ranked seventh nationally last season, the 49ers are ranked 
anywhere from fifth to 14th in the various polls this season, despite the loss 
of guards Traci Waites and Penny Toler, two of the team's top scorers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have Waites and Toler you're guaranteed so many points a game," 
Bonvicini said, adding that this year's lineup will be quicker, taller and more 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Notable off-season acquisitions include sophomore guard Trise Jackson, who was 
academically ineligible last year; and 6-2 forward-center Kari Parriott, who 
transferred from Oregon State, where she averaged 14.4 points and 8.3 rebounds 
in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Angelique Lee, 6-4 and the lone senior, will be the captain and play center. 
Lee averaged 8.6 points and 7.2 rebounds last season and will be counted on to 
improve those numbers with the absence of Waites and Toler. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Penny Moore, who averaged 6.8 points last season, and junior 
guard Dana Wilkerson, who shot 52% from the field while averaging 9.7 points, 
are expected to get more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Three junior newcomers with fairly impressive credentials are forwards Renae 
Duffie and Vjera Kaludjerovich, an international recruit who played on the 
Yugoslavia national team, and guard Serina Strange. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Tesia Green, Marsheela Harriston and Sherri Thormahlen -- all termed 
excellent athletes by Bonvicini -- will add to the team's depth and overall 
speed. PETE THOMAS

RAVELING BELIEVES HE'S SEEN LAST OF LAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So, George Raveling, are you worried that you'll be fired if USC's basketball 
team finishes last in the Pacific 10 for the fifth consecutive season? 
</P>
<P>
"No," the Trojan coach replied. "I'm too far along in my career to worry if I'm 
going to get fired. If I was a young guy just starting out, I'd probably be 
worried. But at this juncture in my career, experience has taught me not to 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of you might say, 'Damn it, you ought to be worried.' But sometimes 
people succeed because they're stubborn and foolish and they think they can 
make something out of nothing. I just happen to be one of those guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the kind of guy who wishes he didn't have reverse in his car. I don't ever 
like to go back and look back. If I could have reverse taken out of my car I'd 
have it taken out tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling hopes that the Trojans will go forward this season, which opens Monday 
with a game against Prairie View A&amp;M at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Raveling has assembled a soft early nonconference schedule, 
including games against St. Francis (Pa.) and Central Connecticut State. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, 10-22 overall and 2-16 in the Pac-10 last season, begin their 
conference schedule at Washington State on Nov. 30, then play at Washington on 
Dec. 2. They don't resume conference play until Jan. 3, when they meet UCLA at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling thinks it's ill-advised to play conference games so early, but Pac-10 
officials said they had to move up the schedule to accommodate the 
season-ending conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the 1989-90 Trojans: 
</P>
<P>
BACKCOURT 
</P>
<P>
The ranks of USC's guards have been somewhat depleted by injuries and academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Cooper, who started 19 games at point guard last season, is expected to 
miss most of the season because of a broken right foot. And Anthony Pendleton, 
who started at shooting guard, left school last summer after he was declared 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, however, still have a strong group of guards, and Raveling has 
even considered starting three guards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the three-guard offense is the wave of the future," he said. "I think 
we're going through an evolution in college basketball. It was a game dominated 
by big men and now it's a game dominated by guards." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner, a highly regarded 6-foot-5 freshman from Inglewood High School, 
is expected to start at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
Miner averaged 29.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and four assists a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling thinks Miner has extraordinary potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like one of those underwater explorers," Raveling said. "They know the 
ship is down there with gold on it; they just have to find it and get it to 
shore." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pack, a 6-2 junior college All-American at Tyler (Tex.) College, is 
expected to start at point guard. Pack averaged 18 points and nine assists last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll bring a dimension to the point-guard position we haven't had 
since I've been here," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who will play in the backcourt are Rodney Chatman, a 6-3 freshman from 
New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; Cordell Robinson, a 6-5 freshman from Detroit; Phil 
Glenn, a 6-1 freshman from Winston-Salem, N.C.; Thurman Brown, a 6-0 junior, 
and Tyrone Fuller, a 6-2 senior. 
</P>
<P>
FRONT COURT 
</P>
<P>
USC led the conference in rebounding last season, but Raveling doesn't expect 
that this season because of the loss of Chris Moore, Andy Olivarez and Alan 
Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have two starters back in the front court -- Ronnie Coleman, a 6-6 
junior power forward, and Chris Munk, a 6-9 senior center. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' small forwards this season include Calvin Banks, a 6-6 junior; 
Keith Greeley, a 6-8 freshman from Riverside, and Sean Zone, a 6-8 freshman 
from Houston.

NEW FACES AND DEPTH TO BENEFIT THE BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grace period is over for UCLA basketball coach Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick begins his second season at UCLA with a team ranked among almost 
everyone's top 20 and expected to remain there for as long as he blows his 
whistle in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
That shouldn't be too difficult, at least through this season. 
</P>
<P>
Four starters return from last season's 21-10 team, including the top forward 
tandem in the Pacific 10 Conference, and Harrick and his staff have recruited a 
freshman class ranked among the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
But standing in the Bruins' way will be Arizona, conference champions three of 
the last four seasons. And the Bruins are young -- eight of their 12 players 
are freshmen or sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
But their schedule, featuring 15 of 27 games at Pauley Pavilion and trips to 
Notre Dame and Louisville, shouldn't be too taxing, and the talent and depth 
are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Bruin starters played against walk-ons in practice. This 
season, they're facing former high school All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day, it's like a game situation," said Trevor Wilson, a senior forward 
who led the Pac-10 in rebounding the last two seasons. "Last year, we didn't 
have anyone to practice against and it was hard to stay focused mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said he didn't think the Bruins could unseat Arizona as the conference 
champion last season. 
</P>
<P>
And this year? 
</P>
<P>
"We have a realistic chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the Bruins: 
</P>
<P>
FORWARDS 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, the Bruins' greatest strength. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some fierce battles at the position, probably as intense as I've 
ever seen," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Don MacLean, last season's Pac-10 freshman of the year and the 
Bruins' leading scorer and No. 2 rebounder, will be challenged for playing time 
by freshmen Tracy Murray and Zan Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Murray ended his career at Glendora High School as the state's all-time leading 
scorer, averaging 44.3 points last season. Mason is an aggressive rebounder and 
defender from Westchester High School. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrick of the freshmen: "They're far enough along that they could 
probably start in our program." 
</P>
<P>
But not this season. 
</P>
<P>
CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
Returning starter Kevin Walker, the Bruins' all-time three-point shooter, has 
improved his inside game, Harrick said, but the most pleasant surprise has been 
the development of Keith Owens. 
</P>
<P>
"There are days when he's the best player on the floor," Harrick said of the 
former walk-on from Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a 6-foot-10 senior, will start, but he will share the position with 
Owens, a 6-7 junior and a superior defender, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to play them equally, but I probably won't," Harrick said. "I 
tend toward the starter a little more, but they're both our starter." 
</P>
<P>
GUARDS 
</P>
<P>
Darrick Martin, who started 22 games last season with playmaker and all-time 
Bruin assist leader Pooh Richardson, is expected to blossom as he returns to 
his natural position of point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He's young and he's got a lot to learn yet," Harrick said of the 5-11 1/2 
sophomore. "But he has a court presence that I really like." 
</P>
<P>
The other guard will be sophomore Gerald Madkins, who sat out last season after 
breaking his pelvis in a traffic accident 16 months ago, or freshman Mitchell 
Butler from Oakwood School in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins has recovered, but the equally gifted Butler has pushed him in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"His experience is the only thing that gives him an edge," Harrick said of 
Madkins, who would have started last season if he hadn't been injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams, who started before giving way to Martin a month into the 
season, is back for his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks better at times than Madkins and Butler," Harrick said.

ETHICS PANEL PROPOSES SWEEPING CITY REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a six-month study, Los Angeles' commission on ethics in government 
proposed a package of sweeping reforms on Monday that would outlaw some of the 
very practices that ignited Mayor Tom Bradley's conflict-of-interest scandal 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, appointed by Bradley the day after his narrow election to an 
unprecedented fifth term in office, set a February deadline for City Council 
adoption of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
If the council does not act, the ethics commission will take its case directly 
to the voters of Los Angeles through a ballot initiative, said commission 
Chairman Geoffrey Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners have formed a "watch committee" of prominent civic, business 
and labor leaders to ensure that the reforms -- touted as the "the cleanest, 
clearest and toughest ethics law in the country" -- are enacted even if the 
City Council remains bogged down in its own effort to write and adopt a new 
code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, still facing a federal grand jury investigation of his financial 
dealings, said at an impromptu press conference that he would do "everything 
within my power" to secure passage of the commission's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations made by the Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for 
Los Angeles City Government is a procedure to appoint a special prosecutor for 
politically sensitive cases, such as the Bradley investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Other reforms include establishment of an independent ethics agency similar to 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission, a ban on outside employment, 
gifts and honorariums for elected officials, a toughening of financial 
disclosure regulations, a cap on campaign spending and partial public financing 
of city political campaigns. In addition, the commission proposed that former 
city officials wait at least a year before returning to City Hall as lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties would range from criminal misdemeanor charges to civil fines of up to 
three times the amount of the financial value of the transgression. If the city 
attorney balks at filing actions against elected officials suspected of 
unethical behavior, the proposed code allows citizens to file lawsuits as 
"private attorneys general." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed code, contained in a 70-page report, won unanimous approval from 
Bradley's seven-member commission: Cowan, Rabbi Allen Freehling, Archbishop 
Roger Mahony, Los Angeles County Bar Assn. President Margaret Morrow, retired 
Superior Court Judge Delbert Wong and attorneys Gilbert Ray and Antonia 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect this report to collect dust," said Ray. "We expect action" by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 19 members of the "watch committee" formed to lobby for adoption of 
the ethics proposals are Warren Christopher, chairman of the law firm of 
O'Melveny &amp; Myers; Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc.; Bill Robertson, 
chief of the Los Angeles County AFL-CIO, and John Mack, president of the Urban 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, however, appears stalled in its own six-month effort to 
legislate ethics at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the council's ad hoc committee on ethics are at odds over key 
ethical questions, such as limits on lobbying by city officials upon their 
return to private life. The City Council committee has also completely avoided 
the issue of campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Employment 
</P>
<P>
The council also appears reluctant to ban outside employment for elected 
officials -- the very practice that touched off the cry for a new ethics code 
earlier this year when it was revealed that Bradley served as a paid adviser to 
Far East National Bank while the institution did business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the City Council committee, said he is 
confident that an ethics reform package will be adopted by February -- but it 
may not be exactly what the mayor's commission has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said she is concerned that the commission's proposal 
is so insulting to ethical people that they would avoid government service. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to make government ethical is to attract the good people," Galanter 
said. "Anybody who would be ethical in office would be dissuaded from running 
because it's insulting. . . . There's a presumption that you must be 
dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cowan, former chairman of California Common Cause, argued: "The best 
way to attract good people to government is to assure them that the government 
will be highly ethical, that they will be working for an institution that is 
worthy of public respect." 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro said he favors a cautious approach to accepting 
the commission's proposals. "The very thoroughness of the (commission's) report 
and recommendations requires the same depth of consideration by the mayor and 
the council." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he supports a tough new set of laws and, on 
a first reading, likes what he sees in the commission's proposals. Yaroslavsky 
said he favors the commission's all-out ban on outside employment, rather than 
a watered-down version being contemplated by the council's ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a stench coming out of City Hall that is choking public confidence. . 
. . It's the decomposition of ethical standards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the commission report is the only complete proposal yet put on 
the table, and he predicted that any other "will be dead on arrival." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he expects the council to tinker with the panel's proposals, "but 
the essence of it ought to remain." 
</P>
<P>
"Taking it piecemeal . . . would be the biggest mistake of all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Freehling said, "It is our strong and unanimous recommendation that these 
proposals be adopted in their entirety. If certain suggestions of ours fail to 
(be adopted), then Los Angeles voters will have the responsibility of codifying 
them by means of a ballot initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Though Bradley had earlier vowed to live by the letter of the commission's 
findings -- and fired off a letter to council members on Monday urging them to 
adopt the commission's proposals -- the mayor demurred when asked if he would 
voluntarily abide by the panel's suggested restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want those reports to be considered by the full council and to have all of 
us act in concert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley bridled when asked whether his controversial financial dealings, which 
spawned calls for ethics reform in the city, would have been prohibited had the 
report's findings been enacted years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not talk about history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor pointed out that "there were no such standards, no such provisions" 
when he accepted money from Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. as a 
director and from Far East National Bank as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
After a phone call from Bradley in March, City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg 
reinstated a $1-million city deposit with Far East and added $1 million more. 
Bradley and Rittenberg have said that the mayor exerted no pressure. In 1988, 
Bradley was paid $18,000 by Far East -- money that he later returned. 
</P>
<P>
In a report in September, City Atty. James K. Hahn said he found insufficient 
evidence to prosecute Bradley for criminal conflict of interest, but he 
criticized the mayor's ethical conduct and sued him for failure to disclose 
some of his personal financial investments. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury is currently investigating Bradley and his relationship 
with several financial institutions, including Far East.

PROPOSED ETHICS REFORMS 
</P>
<P>
Expanded financial disclosure requirements for elected officials and other 
senior city officials, including information about their home financing. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on outside employment, honorariums and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
A one-year ban on lobbying by former elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Limits on campaign spending and partial public funding for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
An independent ethics commission modeled after the State Fair Political 
Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory training courses on ethics for all city employees, lobbyists and 
candidates for office. 
</P>
<P>
Expanded enforcement powers for the city attorney and a process for appointing 
special prosecutors in cases involving elected officials.

SCHOOLS ARE FRUSTRATED BY BILINGUAL CLASS DEMANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Pacific Palisades Elementary School, Principal Terry Arnold has only two 
bilingual teachers and six aides to educate 120 Spanish-speaking students who 
are bused to her school each day. 
</P>
<P>
At Cowan Elementary School in Westchester, teacher Susan Blackwell-Brown hands 
out puzzles to occupy the half-dozen third graders in her class whose language 
she cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
At Wilbur Elementary School in Tarzana, neighborhood parents complain that 
their children's education is suffering as teachers struggle to cope with new 
students who speak no English. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Los Angeles Unified School District, students, teachers, parents and 
administrators are frustrated with a situation in which large numbers of 
elementary school students who cannot speak English are forced to fend for 
themselves in classes where no one speaks their language. 
</P>
<P>
A record 20,000 students -- 7,000 more than last year and most of whom speak 
little English -- are being bused from their overcrowded neighborhoods this 
year to schools ill-equipped to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a struggle," said Blackwell-Brown. "You have no material, you don't speak 
their language . . . sometimes you know they're not getting anything, but 
there's nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
The district's bilingual education plan calls for the use of bilingual teachers 
or aides whenever a school has more than 10 students who speak the same foreign 
language on any grade level. About 90% of foreign students speak Spanish, and 
most who speak other languages are scattered throughout the district and often 
get special instruction. 
</P>
<P>
But there are nowhere near enough bilingual teachers and aides to go around, 
forcing school principals to scrap traditional teaching plans and adopt 
approaches such as team teaching and cooperative learning, which may have 
students as young as first grade changing classrooms and teachers several times 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, all limited-English-proficient kids should be in classrooms 
where someone speaks their language," said Michael Ginsik, an adviser in the 
district's bilingual program. "Realistically, they probably are not." 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual education -- the notion that children should learn in their native 
language before they tackle subjects in English -- has been passionately 
debated nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Steadfast Policy 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district -- with about 170,000 of its nearly 600,000 students 
speaking little or no English -- has remained steadfast in its support for 
bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
But a burgeoning population of students who do not speak English, and a lack of 
teachers and classrooms, threatens to accomplish what bilingual education's 
opponents have not been able to do -- force students to learn in English-only 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the district's bilingual teachers are assigned to schools in South and 
East Los Angeles, where most Spanish-speaking children reside. But because 
schools in those areas are overcrowded, the district has "capped" many of them 
and buses the overflow to schools on the Westside and in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had predicted that a large proportion of the district's enrollment 
growth this year would be among non-English-speaking students as immigrants 
continue to flock to the central city. But the problem has been finding 
classroom space for the new students, while maintaining racial balance and 
minimizing travel time on buses in the sprawling 500-school district. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope a new $5,000 annual pay bonus will attract more bilingual 
teachers. But for now, many schools are forced to rely largely on bilingual 
aides -- primarily college students who work three hours each day with groups 
of non-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
Schools which receive bused-in students are given money by the district to hire 
one aide for every 30 students they receive, but finding the aides has proved 
to be a challenge for some schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're at a school like this, where there's no resident Spanish-speaking 
population and it's far away from any college with (an education) program, it's 
hard to attract aides," said Pacific Palisades Principal Arnold, who has six 
aides for 10 bilingual classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wants to travel way out here and back for a three hour-a-day job?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with the shortage, many principals move their aides around to cover 
more than one classroom -- but that still leaves many Spanish-speaking children 
alone in classes with English-speaking teachers for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the 40 minutes each day that Blackwell-Brown has a bilingual aide in 
her classroom, she tries to make do with the smattering of "street Spanish" she 
picked up teaching in East Los Angeles years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the kids just sit there . . . you know they're not getting anything. 
You feel so guilty, but your back is against the wall. What can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Some overburdened schools try to maximize use of teachers and aides with 
concepts spelled out in the district's master plan for bilingual education. But 
those non-traditional approaches have spawned some opposition from teachers and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got teachers who've been here for years and done a wonderful job and 
suddenly they've got these children they can't reach," said Charlotte McKinney, 
head of a district task force dealing with bilingual education. "It's very 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it used to be -- the self-contained classroom with one teacher where 
the kids get to know each other and stay together -- that's a wonderful model, 
but it doesn't work in this district anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The district is sponsoring training sessions to teach principals and teachers 
concepts such as team teaching -- where two or three bilingual classrooms are 
combined, with a bilingual teacher and a teacher who only speaks English -- and 
cooperative learning groups, where children work with other children, in effect 
tutoring their peers. 
</P>
<P>
Those approaches have incensed some English-speaking parents who feel that 
their children are being shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Students as Tutors 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in an area where there are a lot of housekeepers, so some of our 
kids have picked up a little Spanish," said the mother of a Wilbur student, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my daughter's time is spent tutoring the Spanish-speaking kids because the 
attitude of the teachers is they can't help the kids. They don't speak their 
language, so they're ignoring them, they're leaving them behind." 
</P>
<P>
Parents have also complained about sheltered English, the teaching method many 
monolingual teachers must employ in classrooms that include Spanish-speaking 
youngsters, using a slower pace, simple words, more visuals and more acting 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher winds up having to teach at the lowest common denominator," said 
Elaine Parlen, whose daughter is in the fourth grade at Wilbur. "That's not 
fair to our kids who are trying to learn and to stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the situation is the fact that many Spanish-speaking students did 
not reach their new schools until several weeks into the school year -- and 
some are still coming -- forcing principals to dismantle carefully-conceived 
plans and switch teachers and students around to try to accommodate the 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"We got far more youngsters than we anticipated," said Wilbur Principal Frank 
Specchierla, whose San Fernando Valley school received about 200 
Spanish-speaking students from inner-city schools this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real challenge for everyone," he said. He and the teachers have 
been so preoccupied with the logistics of accommodating the new students, "we 
haven't really had a chance to worry about things like what reading groups (the 
Spanish-speakers) should be in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meant changes for a lot of our kids, but some schools had it worse," he 
said. "I know some principals who had to reorganize four or five times."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 200,000 protesters marched through central Prague on Monday in an 
emotional groundswell of anti-government defiance that almost certainly 
signaled the end of Stalinism in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations against the hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes also 
spread for the first time to large provincial cities, including Bratislava, 
Brno and Pilsen. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters moved through the capital shouting "Freedom, freedom!" as bastions 
of the hard-line Communist state began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly on Monday evening, both Prague Radio and the state television began 
carrying reports that aired sharp criticism of the government, while heads of 
the capital's two largest universities expressed solidarity with a weeklong 
anti-government student strike. 
</P>
<P>
There also were signs of a split within the Communist Party hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Prague Radio reported that the capital's party boss, Miroslav Stepan, 
complained that many in the party were taking what he called "a neutral stand" 
on the present turmoil and spoke of "certain symptoms of a power struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the country's leading dissident, Vaclev Havel, said he had received 
what he called "feelers" from s enior figures within the regime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are watching the end of Jakes," one veteran Western diplomat here declared. 
"He has nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
In a further blow to Jakes, East German leader Egon Krenz canceled plans to 
visit Prague today. The move underscored the growing isolation of the 
Czechoslovak regime, even among its Warsaw Pact allies. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow went public with its disapproval of the regime last week, a move that 
many analysts at the time believed sealed its fate. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak television on Monday read a government appeal for calm. It was 
issued after an emergency plenary meeting of the national government, as well 
as the Czech and Slovak regional governments. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal noted that the government was in favor of dialogue to resolve the 
country's problems, but said answers "could not be sought in an atmosphere of 
emotions, passions and anti-socialist actions such as have occurred over the 
past few days in Prague." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal concluded by defending the brutal police action last Friday in 
breaking up a student protest in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
"No government in a legal state can suffer the violation of its constitution 
and the laws of its country," it said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the statement is expected to have little impact on the wave of 
anti-government feeling rolling through Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has denounced the Friday crackdown, and on Monday it canceled 
a proposed visit to Washington of party ideological chief Jan Fojtik. A State 
Department statement said the visit would be inappropriate "because of the 
violent police actions this past weekend during which scores of peaceful 
demonstrators and U.S. and other international media representatives were 
brutally beaten . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Among the banners and the sea of red, white and blue Czech flags carried by 
marchers Monday, there was no longer fear, only the powerful scent of victory. 
</P>
<P>
As they rallied first in the city's main Wenceslas Square, and later, as they 
marched through adjoining streets, demonstrators shouted a slow, taunting, 
"Jakes, Jakes" followed by a more direct chant of "Jakes out!" and "We want a 
new government!" 
</P>
<P>
One banner read, "We Want a Government With a Higher I.Q." 
</P>
<P>
Riot police prevented marchers from approaching Prague Castle, residence of the 
country's President Gustav Husak, a leading figure among the hard-liners who 
took power in 1968. But there were no reported incidents of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and office workers along the route waved, applauded and hung their 
own national flags from windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I thought it would take weeks for the government to resign. Today I 
think it will be days," a 33-year-old research engineer in the crowd said. 
</P>
<P>
Added an elderly woman in a voice heavy with emotion: "God help us all -- we've 
waited 21 years for this." 
</P>
<P>
It was 21 years ago that the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact forces invaded 
Czechoslovakia to overthrow the liberal government of Alexander Dubcek and 
place the present hard-liners in power. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the demonstration and the dramatic change in content of the 
state-controlled media surprised even the most seasoned diplomatic observers, 
who admitted the pace of opposition to the country's hard-line leadership was 
accelerating far faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly newscasts on official Prague Radio swung wildly, with the 4 p.m. news 
summary carrying only bland official statements, while a similar summary one 
hour later aired unprecedented direct and open criticism of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovaks sitting down to the main evening television news were stunned to 
hear the government's loyal mouthpiece report that 200,000 of their fellow 
citizens were in the streets of Prague expressing a lack of confidence in the 
politicians, in the Communist Party and in the government of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The newscast reported that both the dean of the Technical University and the 
rector of Charles University, the country's largest, had decided to support 
anti-government student strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Czech television also reported that students and teachers in 29 Prague 
secondary schools had agreed spontaneously to strike, but that students would 
attend class "to hold a dialogue with teachers about subjects that could not 
previously be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, small, hand-typed signs appeared in subway stations and 
store windows, announcing a two-hour general strike for next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Theaters, universities and secondary schools in the capital closed for a week 
in protest against what is being referred to now as the "police massacre" of 
students last Friday, and students' emissaries departed for regional cities in 
the country to press for support. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper of the previously docile Socialist Party printed accounts of last 
Friday's police attack on students and called for a "fundamental change in the 
political climate." Newspapers in the capital were sold out virtually before 
dawn Monday, and clusters of Czechoslovaks gathered to read copies of the 
Socialist Party paper that were posted in public places. 
</P>
<P>
There also were reports that coal miners in northern Bohemia had agreed to join 
next Monday's general strike. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no longer dissidents in the secret little ghettos," said dissident 
leader Havel, referring to the small, isolated band of intellectuals that has 
resisted the Communist leadership for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now in a time where there are the beginnings of a real opposition in our 
country," he said. "It's the most important time in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Havel announced the creation of a new opposition grouping called the Civic 
Forum as a coalition of public interests prepared to negotiate with the 
government about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Forum came into existence last night, but I can't predict its future," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said any individual or group "that finds the need" could be part of it. 
"It's open to all people who want democracy in this country," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The new group issued an initial list of four demands, including the resignation 
of those connected with the 1968 invasion of the country -- a list that would 
include Jakes and Husak. 
</P>
<P>
He said the organization could develop along the lines of East Germany's 
opposition New Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also said a representative from miners in northern Bohemia had telephoned 
him Sunday and said an appeal had been issued for all miners in the region to 
join next Monday's strike. If the miners do join the protest, it would be 
another ominous signal for the regime. 
</P>
<P>
The bedrock of the government's support has long been an unspoken social 
contract that workers would remain quiet as long as they were provided material 
goods and a decent standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Czech economists privately claimed that Jakes has mortgaged the country's 
future to keep Czechoslovak stores full. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said he believed recent contacts he and other opposition leaders had 
received from senior figures in the regime were a sign that the struggle within 
the Communist Party for a successor to Jakes was now under way. 
</P>
<P>
"Various power groups intending to go for the leadership are putting cards up 
their sleeves, so that at the right time they can take them out to trump 
others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the common characteristic of all the contacts was that opposition 
interests "would be taken into account when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no facts, no specifics," he added. "There are even the moments when 
they seem to be trying to emulate each other so they can say they were the 
first to contact us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The rise of a national crisis invariably draws Czechs to the heart of Prague, a 
place dominated by an equestrian statue of St. Vaclav, a 10th-Century Bohemian 
ruler who personifies the Czech nation. He is better known in the West through 
the traditional Christmas carol as "Good King Wenceslas." The statue is 
situated at the upper end of a gently sloping broad boulevard called Wenceslas 
Square. It was there in 1968 that thousands gathered to voice support for the 
"Prague Spring" reform movement that was crushed by Soviet tanks. A year later, 
it served as the setting for one of the East Bloc's most dramatic protests 
against Soviet domination, the self-immolation of university student Jan 
Pallach. Now it is again the magnet for protests, this time for tens of 
thousands demanding democratic reforms.

<P>
When Ralph Moore went to the bank a few weeks ago he took along a pink and 
yellow miniature rose plant. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped by the desk of Mary Hill, the assistant vice president. "What a 
gorgeous rose," Hill said. "It's my favorite color, pink." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my newest flower," Moore explained. "I want to name it after a friend, 
but I need her permission first." 
</P>
<P>
"What a lucky person. She will just love it," the banker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you give me your permission?" Moore asked. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that moment, Hill, longtime banker for Moore, told how she was 
"flabbergasted. Imagine having a rose named after you. It immortalizes you." 
</P>
<P>
"Especially miniature roses created by Ralph Moore. They go all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 82, is one of the world's best-known rose breeders. He has developed and 
named more than 300 varieties of flowers and plants over the last 68 years, 90% 
of them miniature roses. 
</P>
<P>
A plant breeder since 1921, he has been naming flowers he creates after people, 
places, events and many other things since he was a 14-year-old sophomore at 
Visalia High School. 
</P>
<P>
Miniature roses he created are growing in every state, in Canada, and all over 
Europe, the Mideast, Africa, the Far East, Mexico, South America, Australia and 
New Zealand. Many are named for people who live in this San Joaquin Valley 
town. 
</P>
<P>
"The first rose I originated I named after Shelby Wallace, one of my best 
friends in high school. He died when we were both sophomores," Moore recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Charles, a coral-red-on-yellow miniature rose, is named after a good 
friend who sings in his church's choir. Rose Gilardi, a slender 
mossy-red-and-pink-striped rose, is named after a woman he knows who raises 
roses in San Francisco and runs a beauty shop there. 
</P>
<P>
Little Mike is a rose he named after a grandson who was a baby at the time and 
is now teaching sixth grade in Exeter. The popular Ann Moore, a bright orange 
rose, is named after his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Bit O' Sunshine was named years ago by a little girl in a Sunday school class 
that Moore taught. "I brought in this new flower and she piped up: 'Mr. Moore, 
that looks just like a bit of sunshine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walking through one of the many greenhouses at his six-acre Sequoia Nursery, 
Moore observed that some plants name themselves. He pointed out a bed of roses 
called Ring of Fire, glowing yellow blooms etched with red that look like a 
ring of fire, and another variety called Magic Carousel, white roses with red 
edges that resemble a merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
He named a miniature rose Over the Rainbow because the colors made him think of 
the song from "The Wizard of Oz." He came up with a striped, red and yellow 
miniature rose at the time of the Coalinga earthquake. The rose is called 
Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
When the Armenian community in Yettem, a small town near Visalia, celebrated 
its 75th anniversary, Moore named a miniature purple rose St. Mary in honor of 
its church. 
</P>
<P>
"Yettem means Garden of Eden in Armenian. The community put on a big banquet 
for their 75th anniversary, and my wife and I were special guests," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was enjoying Dorothy Hamill skating on television one night and decided I 
would name a rose after her. I wrote her agent for permission to do so and he 
wrote back saying he wasn't interested," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dorothy Hamill probably never saw the letter. It's too bad. That rose, now 
called Rise 'n Shine, is considered the best yellow miniature in the world 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 of Moore's flowers are patented. Moore, who receives 8% of the 
retail price for 17 years, derives a large part of his income from these 
royalties. He has 10 employees at his nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago when his daughter, Eleanore Bergthold, now a teacher in Roseville, 
attended Westmont College in Santa Barbara, Moore named a shrub that he 
developed the Westmont Arborvite. He has donated all royalties from the plant 
-- $35,000 to date -- to the school's student loan fund. 
</P>
<P>
Moore lives next to his nursery and can be found seven days a week breeding and 
developing new miniature roses in his greenhouse when he is not on the road. 
</P>
<P>
He attends rose shows and conventions and delivers papers and programs about 
miniature roses throughout this country and overseas. He has won numerous 
awards and is one of three Americans presented the prestigious Dean Hole Medal 
by the Royal National Rose Society of England. He has authored three books 
about miniature roses. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has never named a miniature rose after himself, but another breeder did 
name a test variety that Moore's nursery had developed. He called it Ralph's 
Creeper and the name stuck. Its blooms are bright red with large yellow eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Moore travels he sees his creations. While attending a World Rose 
meeting in Israel in 1981, for example, he visited the nation's biggest 
kibbutz. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I had a thrill. At the entrance to the kibbutz there was a large 
bed full of miniature roses. They were Mona Ruths, a rose I developed and named 
after our daughter, Mona Ruth Sorenson."

ON CALIFORNIA: NOW IS THE NON-WINTER OF DISCONTENT

For weeks now the rains have been due. And for weeks the Santa Ana winds have 
come in their place, and then come again. In the mornings I walk out on my 
patio, just to check. It's always the same. The sky still calm and blue, the 
air so dry it feels peppery against my skin. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend I looked down at the pansies running along the fence. They 
were drooping again, their faces turned down into the dirt. Poor pansies, they 
weren't ready for this. I gave them a splash from the hose, but I knew, and the 
pansies knew, that something was wrong. Our winters seem to have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
I use the term "winter" advisedly, of course, this being Southern California. 
What I mean is that change in the air that comes in mid-autumn, a switch from 
the light, dusty air of summer to something heavy and marine. The air of winter 
rolls off the Pacific in deep currents and fills the L.A. Basin with coolness 
and bite. This air has heft, and its arrival says the rains are coming. 
</P>
<P>
Except that it hasn't happened, not for the past three years. The real marine 
air hasn't showed, and without it the winters have resembled pale versions of 
summer, with the same dry air and thin sunlight. Now, two days before 
Thanksgiving, it seems to be happening again. No rain. 
</P>
<P>
I have a friend who keeps checking, like I do. She says every two or three 
weeks she gets fooled. She will walk out her front door in the morning and 
sense that the winter change is about to take place. The air will be colder and 
damp, and she will say to herself, this must be it. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not. The next day the Santa Ana's will be back and the temperatures 
will push toward the 90s. It leaves her feeling teased, she says, because she 
loves the rains and looks forward to them each fall. When the Santa Ana's hang 
on and on, her skin peels and goes itchy. She pictures herself molting in the 
dry non-winter. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain just what has happened to our winters. Some climate experts 
believe Southern California may be experiencing a first dose of the greenhouse 
effect. Last summer I talked to one scientist in San Bernardino who subscribes 
to this notion and says that, ironically, the deserts may be the first victims. 
The drought already has cut dramatically into the variety of plant life in the 
Mojave, he says, and full recovery would require three straight years of 
above-average rainfall. He's not sure the Mojave will get it. 
</P>
<P>
Others regard this explanation as alarmist. The current stretch of rainless 
winters is likely part of a cycle, they say, a cycle that is governed by 
surface ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific. When the temperature goes 
down out there, rainfall drops here. 
</P>
<P>
If that is true, the most recent readings from the Pacific should be good news. 
It seems that temperatures have risen off the South American coast. The 
weathermen who favor this theory say the coming winter could still bring a 
heavy dose of rain. We'll see. Weathermen make a lot of promises they don't 
keep. 
</P>
<P>
In writing this lament about our missing winters, I realize it leaves me in 
something of a minority. At the end of the past weekend I watched the local 
news, and the second story recounted the day's Santa Ana weather. There was no 
gloom in this report. 
</P>
<P>
A young man was interviewed at Zuma. He had just gone for a run in the hills 
and "could see Catalina." Now he was rewarding himself with a few hours at the 
beach. Here it was November and temps were pushing the mid-80s. Too much, he 
said. This is what L.A. is all about. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, for the most part. It's been that way for a hundred years. In the 
first decades of the century, Los Angeles newspapers regularly denied that it 
ever rained here. They referred to wet episodes as "heavy mists." This was 
about the same time a prominent land developer analyzed his success this way: 
"We sold them the climate and threw the land in." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad that old geezer can't be reconstituted for the new, modern L.A. He'd 
love our non-winters. He could sell climate from October to April, and never 
have to worry about a heavy mist clouding his pitch.

THE BATTLE OF SANTA ROSA PLATEAU; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A DEVELOPER AND CONSERVATIONISTS WILL FACE OFF BEFORE THE 
RIVERSIDE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OVER GRASSLAND THAT IS CONSIDERED AN ECOLOGICAL 
JEWEL.

MURRIETA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Rosa Plateau is an ecological jewel, an oasis in the sprawl of 
subdivisions carpeting southwestern Riverside County. Perched in the Santa Ana 
Mountains above Murrieta, the plateau is a remnant of old California -- acres 
of rolling, native grassland dotted with dense groves of rare Engelmann oak 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy was so taken with the site that it purchased 3,100 acres 
and created a preserve there in 1984. More recently, UNESCO recognized the 
plateau's extraordinary wealth of flora and fauna by including it in a 
"biosphere reserve," a distinction enjoyed by only three other regions in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a neat place; it is an extremely special place with 
ecological value that extends far beyond the Riverside County line," said Jon 
Keeley, a botany professor at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Won Sang Yoo shares Keeley's enthusiasm for the site, but for entirely 
different reasons. The Temecula developer owns 3,855 acres of the 15,000-acre 
plateau and believes -- to the horror of Keeley and other preservationists -- 
it is the perfect setting for thousands of homes and condominiums, a community 
he plans to call Santa Rosa Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the opportunity here to create a state-of-the-art project where people 
live as part of the natural environment," said David Dillon, director of land 
development for Yoo's firm, Ranpac Communities. 
</P>
<P>
A week from today the Riverside County Board of Supervisors will step into the 
fray and determine which vision of the Santa Rosa Plateau will triumph. At a 
hearing on a blueprint for land use in the county's southwestern corner, the 
supervisors will decide whether to increase building densities on the plateau 
to a level where it would be profitable for Ranpac to develop it. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will cap a mushrooming battle that veteran environmentalists say is 
as vitriolic as any they have seen in years. Two citizens groups have formed to 
circulate petitions, raise money and lobby for preservation of the plateau 
while the developer has spent thousands of dollars on consultants charged with 
softening the project's impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists have produced letters from nationally recognized experts as 
testimony to the plateau's uniqueness while Yoo has brought in public relations 
help and released a poll suggesting that more of the region's residents support 
his project than oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
While the confrontation mirrors battles waged time and again throughout 
Southern California, many warriors describe this one as a symbolic last stand 
of sorts in rapidly growing Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of activity suggests a feeling that if we don't set aside some of 
these large tracts as permanent open space soon, there will simply be nothing 
left to protect around here," said Bill Havert, a parks consultant who has 
championed numerous environmental causes in the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes this place worth fighting over? 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the development say the plateau's stellar lineup of animal and 
plant life make it too valuable an ecological treasure to sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Among its botanical highlights are the Engelmann oaks -- majestic, olive green 
trees that differ from live oaks in color and shape. Engelmanns were once 
common from the Mexican border to the Santa Monica Mountains. Today, only the 
plateau is said to host dense woodlands of any significance. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also say Ranpac's project would wipe out 4,000 acres of native 
California prairie containing the largest intact parcel of the purple needle 
grass, bluegrass and other native grasses remaining anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all of California's native grassland has been destroyed by the 
introduction of foreign species," said Gary Bell, manager of the Nature 
Conservancy preserve at the plateau. "What we have here is a large stretch in 
better condition than any I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
That grassland doubles as hunting grounds for much of the wildlife found on the 
plateau, which is home to numerous threatened or endangered species. Mammals 
like badgers and mountain lions are common. An estimated 132 species of birds 
-- including two pairs of nesting golden eagles and the vanishing burrowing owl 
-- also inhabit the plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Ranpac officials say they have gone to great lengths to create a project that 
respects the plateau's natural features, from minor moves like painting homes 
in earth tones to more important measures designed to ease the shock to 
wildlife. Developers note that 2,000 acres of their land will be left as 
passive open space -- most of it sloping, chapparal-covered terrain -- while 
another 400 acres will be parks and a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
All but 10 of the 2,400 oak trees on the plateau will be preserved, with 
development snaking around them. The builders have also monitored the habits of 
wildlife to determine their routes of travel to feeding grounds and water. To 
preserve one heavily traveled canyon slated to be crossed by a new road to the 
project, developers have pledged to construct a $2.1-million bridge rather than 
simply fill in and pave over the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
As for other corridors that will inescapably be blocked by houses, Dillon said 
the golf course will serve as a natural walkway for mountain lion, deer and 
other creatures: "People say, 'What? A golf course as a wildlife corridor?' 
You'd be surprised how well it works," Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, he said, "we've taken extraordinary measures by today's standards 
to be environmentally sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists, however, say that even the best intentions can do little to 
minimize the sheer mass of the project, which includes commercial centers, 
schools and new roads and will change the plateau's character forever. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were building down in the valley, or anywhere else, I wouldn't care," 
said Beverly Burns, 36, of Lake Elsinore, who leads schoolchildren on nature 
walks at the scenic spot. "But to build here, to ruin this, is just criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Silver, a Los Angeles physician who frequently drives to the plateau to 
enjoy the Engelmann oaks, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a big deal about saving these oak trees, but that isn't the point," 
Silver said. "Unless you have groves of reproducing trees and a beautiful 
setting surrounding them, then you really have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents are pushing the county to buy the plateau and create a 
regional park. Dillon said Ranpac will entertain offers for the land but will 
not put plans on hold while conservationists search for money. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Walt Abraham, whose district includes the plateau, declined to say 
how he will vote on the zoning change, although he said the idea of a county 
park at the site -- which he calls "probably the most sensitive in the county" 
-- is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "I come from a world of reality, and we're not made of money. 
At this point, I don't know what the answer is."

TERROR THREAT PROMPTS ALERT AT U.S. BASES;

PANAMA: DANGER COMES FROM DRUG CARTELS. EXTRA SECURITY CAUSES MASSIVE TIE-UPS, 
DELAYS FOR PERSONNEL.

<P>
Security has been tightened at all U.S. military installations in Panama 
because unidentified terrorists linked to the Latin American drug cartels have 
threatened to attack American targets there, Administration sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington said that the threat, received a week ago, is 
being taken "very seriously." They declined to be more specific, citing 
security concerns. The source and exact nature of the threat are "very heavily 
classified," a senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official said the threat originally targeted three U.S. military 
bases on the Pacific end of the Panama canal -- Albrook Air Force Station, 
Howard Air Base and Ft. Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, the alert was broadened to include all military 
installations in Panama, where 12,000 U.S. personnel are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of weekend meetings in Washington, including one at the White 
House, officials decided to continue the high state of readiness, citing an 
"ongoing" threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Although no explosions have occurred, heightened security remains in effect at 
all U.S. defense sites," a Defense Department official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There is an "extremely serious evaluation of the threat being conducted by 
several U.S. agencies," a federal source said. 
</P>
<P>
Increased security measures led to massive congestion in Panama, where one 
military officer reported that it took him three hours to commute to work, 
normally a 20-minute trip. 
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers operating from Colombia have waged a long campaign of terror 
against police, prosecutors and public officials there. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the current threats against U.S. installations are not 
linked to Panama's military chief and ruler, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. He is 
under indictment by grand juries in Tampa, Fla., and Miami on drug-trafficking 
charges and narrowly escaped a coup attempt in early October. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama, oversees American military 
operations in Central and South America. Its commander, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, 
called for an all-out war on the drug cartels when he was sworn in Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We must fight drug traffickers who threaten our families and our peoples," 
Thurman said at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman was in Washington on Monday to testify before a closed session of the 
House Armed Services Committee on the subject of the U.S. presence in Panama 
and possible American participation in future coup attempts there. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and congressional oversight committees recently approved a new 
effort to overthrow Noriega, designating $3 million for a CIA-led effort to 
recruit Panamanian dissidents to topple the dictator.

DEFENSE SPENDING MAY HINGE ON SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: EVENTS IN BOTH EUROPE AND WASHINGTON ARE PUSHING THE ISSUE OF U.S. 
AND SOVIET TROOP REDUCTIONS EVER HIGHER ON THE AGENDA.

Next month's summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev will play a key role in determining the size of the 
Administration's next defense spending proposal, White House officials said 
Monday, linking the summit and the budget publicly for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"The President hasn't made a decision" yet on spending levels, State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. But with U.S. troops in Europe one of the 
Pentagon's major budget items, he "might well make his decision in light of 
what he learns and from what he discusses with Mr. Gorbachev in Malta." 
</P>
<P>
When the summit first was announced earlier this month, Administration 
officials tried to discourage the idea that U.S. troop strength in Europe would 
be a major issue there. But events in both Europe and Washington are combining 
to push the issue of U.S. and Soviet troop cuts ever higher on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, recognizing that fact, slowly has begun to raise its own 
public expectations for the Dec. 2 and 3 encounter, which Administration 
officials resolutely refer to as a "meeting," rather than a "summit." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance in the next couple of years to really enhance the peace," 
Bush said Monday at a fund-raising reception in Warwick, R.I., for Republican 
Gov. Ed DiPrete. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting off Malta is "going to be historic," he added. "Who could possibly 
have predicted the dynamic change that is taking place in Eastern Europe? We 
are living in exciting times. We are living in times where the potential for 
peace . . . has never been better." 
</P>
<P>
Those unexpected changes in Eastern Europe have undermined the traditional 
rationale for a heavy U.S. presence in Europe, Administration officials admit. 
Since World War II, allied planners have feared that the Soviets would use the 
Soviet army and forces of its Warsaw Pact allies to stage a surprise attack 
into the West European heartland. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) was created, and that's 
why we've maintained the forces we have in Europe over the years," Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney noted in a recent television interview. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, such an attack "is very unlikely," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the stalemate over the federal budget deficit has increased pressure in 
Washington for cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some big problems" in Congress on defense spending, an 
Administration official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The capital is awash with ideas for new federal programs -- Bush himself has 
proposed plans for a space mission to Mars, a tax credit for child care, 
expanded spending for early childhood education, increased federal support for 
low-income housing and a major "war on drugs." But the money is not available 
unless something else is cut or taxes are raised. 
</P>
<P>
As Administration officials and congressional leaders look for ways to fund new 
programs, or simply to reduce the red ink, the Pentagon's $300-billion budget 
is an increasingly attractive target. 
</P>
<P>
And when Pentagon planners begin to look at ways to scale back their forces, 
"you just can't get there from here without taking a chunk out of Europe," as 
one Army official put it. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials already are considering contingency plans for cutting up to 
$180 billion from defense spending in the years from 1992 through 1994, a 
three-year period during which the Pentagon had been planning to spend more 
than $1 trillion.

SENATE OKS BILL TO ALLOW CHINA STUDENTS TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ignoring a veto warning, the Senate on Monday gave final congressional approval 
to a bill that would allow an estimated 30,000 Chinese students to remain in 
the United States indefinitely rather than risk punishment for pro-democracy 
views if they return home. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action by voice vote followed a unanimous 403-0 vote by the House 
in favor of the legislation. The Bush Administration opposes the bill on 
grounds that its enactment would end educational exchanges with the Beijing 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the President will veto this bill," said the Senate's No. 2 
Republican, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. If he rejects the measure after 
Congress departs later this week as planned for the rest of the year, there 
would be no chance for the Senate or House to attempt an override until 
Congress reconvenes next year. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said Bush responded quickly to protect Chinese students in this country 
after the Chinese army massacred unarmed protesters in Tian An Men Square and 
smashed pro-democracy demonstrations last June 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
The President directed Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to defer the departure of 
these students, many of whom had taken part in pro-democracy protests in the 
United States before and after the Tian An Men events, until it was safe for 
them to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Visas issued to about 30,000 of the 40,000 Chinese students in this country on 
cultural or educational programs require them to return home for two years 
after their studies here end. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the State Department's recommendation that Bush veto the legislation, 
the unanimous vote in the House might deter him. "Students are in great danger 
if they go back at this time," California Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been reluctant to antagonize the Beijing regime any 
further, and the President has seemed eager to improve relations despite the 
global outcry against repression of the demonstrators last June. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Administration accepted sanctions voted last week by the House and 
Senate that would ban sales of arms and police equipment and export of 
American-made satellites for launch in China. The sanctions would also suspend 
cooperation on nuclear issues, bar further liberalization of high-tech exports 
and suspend a U.S. investment insurance plan.

The sanctions, in addition to the cutoff of military sales and high-level 
official contacts ordered by Bush immediately after the Tian An Men crackdown, 
brought strong protests from China. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), author of the original House 
measure, said she doubts that Bush will veto it because such action would 
indicate that he is "weak on China."

Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said he retired because he might say crazy 
things as he ages, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to senior officials, Deng said his retirement was designed to end 
the practice of lifetime tenure among top officials. 
</P>
<P>
"My last function is to take the lead to abolish lifetime employment," Wen Wei 
Po quoted Deng as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"When a man grows old, he tends to become stubborn and lose energy; this cannot 
be changed by subjective will. I am old now, my brain still works, but I may 
say crazy things in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The speech was made Sept. 4, two months before Deng, 85, officially resigned 
from his last Communist Party post.

PROTESTING PRIESTS SAY U.S. AID IS HELPING DESTROY EL SALVADOR

American aid to El Salvador is emboldening the government's military and 
destroying the country, Roman Catholic priests said Monday as they protested 
U.S. policy and prayed for six slain Jesuit priests. 
</P>
<P>
At a demonstration by more than 600 protesters, federal officials arrested 110 
demonstrators -- some of them priests -- for sitting down and blocking the 
doors of the Federal Building. San Francisco police arrested 26 other 
demonstrators for blocking the sidewalk. Virtually all were cited and released. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 Jesuits were among the protesters who prayed, chanted and carried 
signs to commemorate the slaying of the Jesuits at Central American University 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become very clear over this decade that United States aid, which is up 
to $1.4 million every day, is that which is destroying the people of El 
Salvador," said Father William J. Wood, executive director of the California 
Catholic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush declared Monday that he cannot abandon "a fragile democracy" and 
said any congressional aid cutoff to El Salvador would be an unacceptable 
response to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the Salvadoran government is under control of the ARENA party, "which 
has proved itself as bad as Hitler ever was in its commitment to work only for 
the welfare of those who they consider to be the pure."

CANDIDATES GET SIMILAR ECONOMIC ADVICE; 
</P>
<P>
BRAZIL: BOTH THE SOCIALIST AND THE CENTRIST ARE URGED TO INCREASE SALARIES OF 
LOW-PAID WORKERS AND EXPAND SERVICES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economic advisers to both candidates in Brazil's presidential runoff election 
propose salary increases for low-paid workers, expanded government social 
services, tougher tax-collection policies and reduction of foreign debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Luis Inacio da Silva, 44, says he is a socialist; his opponent, 
Fernando Collor de Mello, 40, calls himself a centrist. Yet despite that 
ideological gap, economists formulating plans for their would-be 
administrations are not always at odds. Interviews published Monday with two 
advisers to Da Silva and one to Collor highlight similarities as well as 
differences between the two camps competing to run Latin America's largest 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Aloisio Mercadante, a top adviser to Da Silva and a member of his 
Workers' Party, said businessmen need not fear a government headed by Da Silva, 
known as Lula. 
</P>
<P>
"Some businessmen, not all, fear our proposal for government because it 
advocates a redistribution of income that hurts the consolidated interests of 
large economic groups, of a privileged elite that dominates the politics and 
economics of Brazil," Mercadante said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, our proposal is very clear: Those business sectors ready to 
invest their resources in production will have plenty of room in the government 
that Lula intends to carry out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A government headed by Lula would attempt to stimulate production by raising 
salaries and consumer demand, he said, adding, "The priority will be to make 
industry produce more food, shoes, clothing -- because if not, the salary 
increases will turn into inflation and lines." 
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum monthly salary, currently about $50, would rise to $200 
over five years under Lula. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lula would increase Brazilian imports and try to attract private 
foreign investment, Mercadante said. 
</P>
<P>
"Another point is a new fiscal policy, whose first moment is fighting tax 
evasion," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Paul Singer, another adviser to Lula, said wealthier Brazilians will 
have to bear the burden of increased government spending. "To invest more in 
public spending, we are going to charge higher taxes to the richer ones," 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Workers' Party platform calls for nationalizing health care, public 
transportation, education and the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my proposals is to nationalize the financial system -- not only the 
banks, but the whole system," Singer said. "If you have opposition from the 
private financial system, it destabilizes the entire economy." 
</P>
<P>
Singer also emphasized the Workers' Party plan to suspend payments on Brazil's 
$112-billion foreign debt while the country decides what part of the debt is 
"illegitimate." 
</P>
<P>
"Our forecast is that 40% of the debt is illegitimate, because it is from the 
period of 1979 to 1984, when the United States raised international interest 
rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Collor's chief economic adviser, did not call for 
suspension of payments but said Collor's policy will be to "decentralize" 
foreign debt negotiations so that each Brazilian state, municipality, private 
company and government-controlled enterprise that owes money abroad would seek 
agreement with its creditors on payment schedules. 
</P>
<P>
De Mello said the policy would save the government $11.5 billion in debt 
payments over five years. She said that fiscal reform, including a crackdown on 
tax evasion, would increase government revenues from $35 billion in 1989 to $52 
billion in 1994. And she said a "profound process of privatization" of 
government-run enterprises would bring in $31.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Government investment would concentrate on social programs such as health care, 
education, transportation and housing, De Mello said. A Collor government would 
spend $18 billion on subsidized housing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She pledged that the minimum monthly salary would be increased to $369 over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lula's and Collor's advisers say that efforts to control inflation, now 
racing at nearly 40% a month, will be their top priority. But both Singer and 
De Mello emphasized their opposition to freezing prices and wages. They agreed 
that prices and wages should be controlled by negotiated agreements among 
government, the private sector and labor representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential runoff vote is scheduled for Dec. 17, and the new president 
will take office March 15. After the first round of elections Wednesday, Collor 
took a wide lead in early vote tabulations, but Lula's second-place finish was 
not confirmed until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With 99.3% of the votes officially tabulated Monday, Collor had 28.4%, Lula 
16.1%, left-leaning populist Leonel Brizola 15.5%, Social Democrat Mario Covas 
10.8% and conservative Paulo Maluf 8.3%. Remaining votes were shared by 16 
other candidates.

3 EX-POLICEMEN BLOW WHISTLE ON ALLEGED SOUTH AFRICA DEATH SQUAD; 
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: FORMER OFFICERS CLAIM THEY WERE PART OF A TEAM INVOLVED IN KILLING 
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. POLICE DENY SUCH SQUADS EXISTED -- BUT IF THEY DID,

PRETORIA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't until the months of waiting on Death Row had dwindled to hours that 
former policeman Almond Nofomela began to panic. His former superiors had 
promised to win him a reprieve. But there he sat in Pretoria Central Prison, 
only a day away from the gallows -- and a dirty secret about the police was 
about to die with him. 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela felt the chill of betrayal when two police officers visited and 
"informed me that I should take the pain." 
</P>
<P>
That's when Nofomela began to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Now the desperate allegations of that condemned man have begun to pull back the 
curtain on a mysterious and sordid part of South Africa's past, implicating for 
the first time a top-secret police unit in some of the dozens of unsolved 
murders of anti-apartheid activists. 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela, who is black, a second black ex-policeman and their white captain 
have admitted being part of a formal political hit squad, operating under the 
command of generals in the South African police, that assassinated government 
opponents both here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Among the squad's alleged victims were white activist Ruth First, killed by a 
parcel bomb in neighboring Mozambique in 1982, and black civil rights lawyer 
Griffiths Mxenge, abducted and stabbed to death in Durban in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela's detailed affidavits describe several brutal assassinations, by 
knives, poison and silencer-equipped pistols, from 1981 until 1986. All victims 
were men and women the police suspected of being members of the outlawed 
African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Nofomela's account was corroborated last week by the published 
statements of his former superior officer, Capt. Dirk Johannes Coetzee, who 
left the force in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"My men and I killed and eliminated political enemies of the government," 
Coetzee, 44, told Vrye Weekblad (Free Weekly), a respected Afrikaans-language 
newspaper, last week after fleeing the country for the island of Mauritius and 
then Europe. "I never hesitated to carry out an order. I thought, 'There are 
people who want to take this land, and they must be killed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coetzee, saying he now is troubled by his conscience, has identified a dozen 
ranking officers of the police force, including a current police general, who 
knew about or participated in the squad's missions. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, a senior police spokesman, denies the existence of 
any official hit squads in the national police force. If such squads existed, 
he said, they were rogue units, operating on their own, and any police officer 
who has "taken the law into his own hands . . . will have to be punished." 
</P>
<P>
But anti-apartheid leaders, long suspicious of the lack of arrests made by 
police in attacks on government opponents and their property, say the 
allegations by Nofomela and Coetzee, as well as other new evidence, point to 
high-level police involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"This was done in an organized way, and it goes all the way to the top (of the 
police force)," said a member of a panel of anti-apartheid leaders who is 
familiar with the growing body of evidence gathered by human rights lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The group, formed to investigate increasing attacks on political activists, has 
collected Nofomela's affidavits and evidence from the inmate's home, including 
false passports, photographs of alleged hit squad victims and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
The police have launched their own investigation, directed by the chief public 
prosecutor in the Orange Free State and police Lt. Gen. Alwyn Conradie. But 
Coetzee claims officers have been destroying evidence at police headquarters, 
including internal log books, and he says officers in the unit have been told 
to deny everything. 
</P>
<P>
Many community leaders have demanded an independent inquiry into the charges. 
Even the Citizen, a pro-government daily newspaper, called Monday for a 
judicial probe "to put the public's mind at rest." 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela, 32, sentenced to death for murdering a white farmer while on a 
month's leave from the force in 1987, has won a temporary stay of execution 
while the investigation continues. A second black member of the unit, David 
Tshikalange, confirmed Nofomela's account before leaving the country. Capt. 
Coetzee is in hiding in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 anti-government activists have been murdered in the past 15 
years, about half of them inside South Africa, according to human rights 
groups. In only one case has anyone been charged. Dozens of other activists 
have disappeared, many after being taken into custody by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The government usually attributes the killings of ANC operatives to internal 
ANC power struggles. Incidents inside the country are often blamed on shadowy 
groups of white supremacists. Coetzee, in his interview with Vrye Weekblad, 
admitted that he directed a team of black policemen, known as "Askaris" or the 
"A-team," who worked from a secret headquarters at Vlakplaas, a farm near 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
They abducted ANC operatives inside and outside South Africa and, during hours 
of interrogation, attempted to "turn" them into anti-terrorist police officers. 
Those they couldn't "turn," Coetzee said, were often killed, their bodies 
burned. On occasion, he said, he and his men received orders from senior 
officers in Pretoria to carry out assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
Police have acknowledged the existence of the anti-terrorism unit at Vlakplaas, 
but they deny it was ever used to assassinate government opponents. Stadler, 
the police spokesman, said Vlakplaas is home base for former ANC guerrillas who 
are now "proud South African policemen." He added police were "perturbed" that 
Coetzee had put the lives of those officers in jeopardy by identifying the 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
The most damning allegations made by Coetzee and Nofomela concern the death 
eight years ago of Griffiths Mxenge, a prominent civil rights lawyer who was 
stabbed 45 times and had his throat cut. 
</P>
<P>
Mxenge's wife, Victoria, also a lawyer, vowed to bring the killers to justice. 
But in 1985 she was shot in front of her home by four black men who chased her 
to the front door and finished the job with an ax. No one was arrested in 
either case, although a witness later testified in an unrelated court case that 
Mrs. Mxenge's assailants included a police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
In his affidavits, Nofomela says Brig. Willem Schoon and Capt. Coetzee ordered 
him and three other black policemen in 1981 to "eliminate" Mxenge, whom the 
police suspected of handling the financial affairs for the outlawed ANC. 
Coetzee "instructed us specifically not to shoot Mxenge, but to kill him with a 
knife." 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela and his three colleagues parked their truck in the middle of a road 
near Mxenge's home and put the hood up. Mxenge, driving a white Audi, pulled up 
behind the men and "asked whether he could help us," Nofomela said. "I 
approached the car and said, 'Yes, please.' He then switched off his ignition 
and I produced my firearm." 
</P>
<P>
The men drove Mxenge to an empty stadium and ordered him out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
"We started assaulting him with kicks and punches, until he fell to the ground. 
We then all stabbed him several times. He immediately died, and we carried on 
butchering his body," Nofomela said. Obeying Coetzee's instructions, they 
removed Mxenge's watch and billfold "to simulate a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
The radio-tape player was removed from Mxenge's car, which was driven to the 
Swaziland border and burned in a field. The radio was later installed in Brig. 
Schoon's police vehicle, according to Nofomela's statement. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Coetzee handed each of the four men 1,000 rand, about $400, which 
he said was from Schoon "for successfully eliminating Mxenge." (Schoon retired 
from the police force three weeks ago at age 55.) 
</P>
<P>
Nofomela said he participated in eight other assassinations, including killings 
in neighboring Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, and many kidnapings during his 
stint in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
In his interview with Vrye Weekblad, Coetzee admitted ordering Nofomela and his 
colleagues to murder Mxenge and make it look like a robbery. He also 
acknowledged paying them each a 1,000-rand bonus "for their good work." 
</P>
<P>
Coetzee also claimed that: 
</P>
<P>
His unit broke into the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 
Mbabane, Swaziland, and stole files, telexes and a variety of envelopes bearing 
the commission emblem. One of those envelopes was later used to hide the parcel 
bomb that was mailed to Maputo, Mozambique, and killed activists Ruth First, 
wife of South African Communist Party General Secretary Joe Slovo, a senior 
member of the ANC in exile. (First's life with her daughter was the subject of 
the film, "A World Apart.") 
</P>
<P>
He and other officers used a sleeping potion developed by the police forensics 
lab to drug two suspected ANC members and then shot them in the head with a 
9-millimeter Makarov pistol equipped with a silencer, burned the bodies and 
tossed the ashes into a river. 
</P>
<P>
A bomb used to blow up the ANC offices in London in 1982 was smuggled into 
Britain in the South African Embassy's diplomatic pouch. 
</P>
<P>
Police Maj. Gen. Stadler has portrayed the claims as the "wild and untested 
allegations" of a Death Row inmate trying to save his life and a disgruntled 
white police officer who was suspended from the force. 
</P>
<P>
Coetzee, who suffers from diabetes, was allowed to retire early and keep his 
rank after his conviction at a departmental hearing on charges of sending a 
telephone-tapping report to political opponents of the government and asking a 
fellow officer to help him bring $150,000 illegally into the country. 
</P>
<P>
Coetzee told Vrye Weekblad that he decided to leave the country and admit his 
role in the police hit squad because "I have no future in South Africa. I owe 
it to my wife and children to begin a new life." 
</P>
<P>
For his role in the assassinations and bombings, he said, "I think of myself 
with contempt."

A congressional report released Monday recommends that the Justice Department 
investigate a former federal housing official alleged to have violated ethics 
laws by using government contacts to benefit her private business. 
</P>
<P>
The report, endorsed by the House Government Operations Committee, concludes 
that June Koch, a former Department of Housing and Urban Development official, 
appears to have broken the law by using her HUD contacts to promote a 
consulting firm she founded to advise U.S. companies doing business with the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Koch became HUD assistant secretary for policy development in 1984. Her duties 
included arranging HUD participation in a number of trade issues involving the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutors expect a grand jury to return an indictment today 
against a woman dubbed "Robin HUD" who admitted taking more than $5 million 
from the government, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
HUD sources and the Justice Department said prosecutors had presented evidence 
to the panel in Baltimore allegedly showing that Marilyn Louise Harrell, who 
told Congress she took $5.5 million from HUD, had misused government funds on 
several occasions. Harrell said she spent part of the $5.5 million to help the 
needy.

A federal prison inmate suffering from AIDS was on his way to a private 
hospital Monday after a judge ruled that the U.S. Bureau of Prisons lacks 
adequate facilities to treat the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case of Leonardo Botero Gomez, 43, said Monday that this is the 
first time a sentenced federal prisoner has been freed on bond for medical 
treatment and they are preparing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all 
federal prisoners with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bureau of Prisons spokesman Greg Bogdan said the agency was 
conferring with its counsel and seeking more information before responding 
publicly to the ruling. He initially said there is not a large number of 
federal inmates with AIDS, but later said the agency would not comment on that 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, sentenced May 5 to a minimum of 10 years for cocaine trafficking, is in 
the most advanced stage of AIDS and has a life expectancy of 24 months or less, 
one of his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman ordered Gomez freed Friday on $250,000 bond 
pending a full civil trial, scheduled for January. The inmate was released 
later in the day after Spellman's order was upheld by the U.S. 11th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Spellman heard testimony that Gomez, who is taking the anti-AIDS drug AZT, was 
being treated at the infirmary of the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center 
near Miami. About every four weeks he was sent to the AIDS treatment center at 
Miami's public Jackson Memorial Hospital.

CREW FAILED TO FIX FAULTY RUDDER SETTING BEFORE EAST RIVER JET CRASH, DATA 
SHOWS

The cockpit crew of USAir's Flight 5050 called out all the required flight 
checks but did not fix a misaligned rudder before attempting to take off, 
according to cockpit transcripts and flight recorder data released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The plane almost immediately began to drift, causing an aborted takeoff and 
subsequent skid into New York's East River Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"All the appropriate items on the before-engine start, after-engine start, the 
taxi and the before-takeoff checklists were verbalized," said National 
Transportation Safety Board Electronics Engineer James R. Cash, who analyzed 
the flight recorder's data. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports suggest that the crash, which killed two of the 61 people 
who boarded the aircraft at La Guardia International Airport, may have been 
caused by a misaligned stabilizer or rudder, which was checked during the 
preflight evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The recording indicated that after the pilots tested the stabilizer, it 
returned to 15.9 degrees left position when it should have been set for zero. 
Investigators acknowledged earlier that the misaligned stabilizer could account 
for the drift and subsequent aborted takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
But National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the 
stabilizer is one of many factors that investigators are examining. 
</P>
<P>
"We're many months away from determining the cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The transcripts, which include the equipment check by the pilots, do not show 
conclusively whether the crash was caused by human or mechanical error, and 
further analysis of the flight data is scheduled, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration suspended the licenses of Capt. Michael W. 
Martin and Co-pilot Constantine Kleissas two days after the crash, when they 
initially refused to be tested for drug and alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
Urine samples taken 44 hours after the crash found Martin to have taken a 
prescription muscle relaxant and an over-the-counter painkiller, which he said 
he took for injuries he sustained in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 5050, en route to Charlotte, N.C., marked the first time Kleissas 
piloted a 737 after completion of flight training. He had flown 3,300 flight 
hours, mostly in smaller passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript illustrates Kleissas' inexperience. At one point Kleissas 
accidentally hit a button that disconnected automatic throttle advances, and 
Martin corrected the mistake manually. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, that's the wrong button pushed," Martin told Kleissas seconds into the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, I knew that," Kleissas responded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one underneath there," said Martin. "All right I'll set your power." 
</P>
<P>
Five seconds later the transcript indicates "the sound of a bang . . . sound of 
loud rumble (and) sound similar to throttles hitting the idle stops." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's take it back," Martin said as the rumbling sound increased. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going off, we're going off, we're going off," Kleissas radioed 20 
seconds later, moments before the aircraft skidded into the river.

CALIFORNIA 94 RENAMED TO HONOR MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-mile stretch of California 94, from downtown San Diego to its interchange 
with California 125 in La Mesa, was formally christened Monday as the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Four green-and-white signs, each 14 feet long by 3 1/2 feet wide, along the 
state route were unveiled Monday at a press conference officially acknowledging 
the name change, San Diego's latest effort to find a permanent memorial for the 
slain civil-rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the memorial issue has thrust the city in a racially and 
politically divisive debate. The renaming of the freeway has been one of the 
least favorite choices of San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, a black community leader who has fought to have the 
San Diego Convention Center named for King, said at the unveiling that, 
although he supports renaming the freeway, he isn't satisfied, and that San 
Diego must still deal with what he called racism and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the San Diego City Council decided against seeking a name 
change for California 94 and instead voted to designate Market Street as Martin 
Luther King Way. But, a year later, San Diego voters rescinded that decision by 
overwhelmingly approving a referendum that restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, a private group, led by members of the Chamber of Commerce, 
worked with black leaders to find another replacement, settling on a 
scholarship fund and King statue to be built in Balboa Park. Fund raising for 
the $750,000 goal has stalled at about $150,000, civic leaders said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Also attempting to move ahead was the City Council, which called on the Board 
of Port Commissioners to name the new convention center in King's honor, a 
recommendation pushed by the King Tribute Advisory Board. The group held a 
series of eight poorly attended public hearings before voting on its 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
By last July, the port board decided by a 4-3 vote to keep King's name off the 
center, which opens to the public Friday as the San Diego Convention Center. A 
Stevens-led group has promised to protest and picket the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that vote that Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state 
Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) introduced a resolution asking the 
Legislature to rename California 94. The Legislature approved the request in 
September, specifying, however, that private donations be used to pay for the 
new signs. 
</P>
<P>
The Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee was formed to raise the money. Its 
chairman is Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God in 
Christ on Imperial Avenue. Sharing the leadership of the group are Gordon C. 
Luce, chairman of Great American Bank; Kim Fletcher, chairman of HomeFed Bank, 
and Deddeh. 
</P>
<P>
The group has raised $1,400 of the $2,700 needed for the signs, according to a 
committee spokeswoman.

EPA DEMANDS SEWER UPGRADE BY END OF '99; 
</P>
<P>
SEWAGE: THE FEDERAL AGENCY'S TIMETABLE IS NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF WHAT THE 
CITY OF SAN DIEGO SAYS IS POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The EPA is demanding that San Diego complete a $2.8-billion upgrading of its 
sewage-treatment system by December, 1999, nearly eight years earlier than the 
city claims is technically possible, according to documents filed Monday in 
connection with the agency's federal lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, which publicly disclose for the first time the 
positions of the two sides in the legal battle, city experts predict that they 
can overhaul the system by August, 2007, when conversion of the city's Point 
Loma treatment plant to so-called "secondary" standards would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement negotiations in the case are occurring from time to time, but the 
Environmental Protection Agency, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice, 
and the city have spent recent weeks feverishly preparing for trial by taking 
depositions from witnesses and preparing the arguments outlined in the 
memoranda filed Monday. The state of California also is a plaintiff in the 
action against the city because the federal Clean Water Act also requires that 
the city comply with state sewage-treatment regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster delayed the trial date from Dec. 5 to 
Jan. 9, which provides more time for a negotiated settlement. But city 
officials did not have encouraging words. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at 2007, and there's not a lot of give in that number," said 
Councilman Ron Roberts, a main supporter of the city's plan to build a 
treatment system that also would reclaim as much as 133 million gallons of 
water daily for use in irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced in my own mind that, short of the federal government coming in 
with a program that would mirror the effort to put a man on the moon, you 
physically could not do it" by 1999, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that sewage-system users could not afford the sizable fee 
increases necessary to complete the upgrading by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
But Gerald George, senior counsel for the Justice Department, said the city's 
timetable includes social and political factors that should not be included in 
Brewster's determination of how quickly the city can assemble a new treatment 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not saying they couldn't. They're saying they don't want to," George 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides cannot settle before Jan. 9, Brewster will decide the 
construction timetable in the first, or "remedy," phase of the trial. At a 
subsequent trial, he would determine whether the city should be penalized for 
violations dating back to 1983, and how large those fines might be. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and the state sued the city last year for missing a July, 1988, 
deadline for compliance with the Clean Water Act and spilling untreated sewage 
into local waterways. The federal law required that all cities upgrade their 
sewage treatment systems to secondary standards, under which 85% to 90% of 
solids are removed from effluent before it is dumped in the ocean. The city's 
current "advanced primary" treatment system removes 75% to 80% of the solids. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also seeks potentially millions of dollars in fines for past sewage 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
City planners and consulting engineers have drawn up plans for a $2.6- to 
$2.8-billion renovation of the sewage treatment system that would be the 
largest public-works project ever undertaken by the city. In addition to 
upgrading the Point Loma plant, the system would add a secondary-treatment 
plant in the South Bay, a South Bay ocean outfall that may be several miles 
long and six water reclamation plants around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although some information on the city's proposed construction timetable has 
appeared in news reports, it generally was secret until outlined in the memo 
submitted Monday by city attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
In its list of milestones, the city proposes to continue planning and financing 
the system from now until 1997. Design would begin near the end of 1991 and 
continue until mid-1999. The first phase of construction would begin in 
mid-1994 and last until early 2002. Final construction on the Point Loma plant 
would start in late 2001 and continue until August, 2007. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's documents, it would take two to three years just to 
reorganize the Metropolitan Sewerage System, which now includes 1.7 million 
people in 16 cities and sewage districts, to better facilitate the sale of 
bonds that will finance construction of the sewer project. 
</P>
<P>
The city also argues that, "in all, well over 20 major projects will be 
required in the initial phases of this program, with several of the projects 
individually being more costly and complex than the recently completed San 
Diego Convention Center. It is critical that the milestones are selected in 
recognition of the enormous size and complexity of the project." 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining approvals from other jurisdictions within the sewage system will also 
be time-consuming, according to the city's memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy City Atty. Ted Bromfield said Monday that, although EPA officials 
orally support the city's water-reclamation efforts, the 1999 deadline does not 
allow time for construction of the additional facilities necessary to exceed 
secondary standards and make sewage reusable on golf courses, crops and highway 
medians. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they like reclamation . . . and their schedule is based on a 
secondary program. We don't think it's appropriate," Bromfield said. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA, which is demanding several injunctions against the city, claims 
that, "to comply with the intent of Congress, the city must be ordered to 
comply with the secondary-treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act through 
construction of secondary-treatment facilities in accordance with the tightest, 
technically justified construction schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the December, 1999, deadline, the federal agency is demanding an 
injunction that would require the city to maintain a capital-improvement 
program that would prevent further sewage spills from antiquated pipelines, and 
another injunction that would require enforcement of penalties against 
companies and others who dump waste into the sewer system without 
"pre-treatment" to take out heavy metals and other waste that could harm the 
ocean environment. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA also wants Brewster to ensure that the city maintains adequate budget 
and staff to comply with the Clean Water Act, limit sewage flows so that the 
system does not overflow its existing capacity of 190 million gallons daily, 
and regularly monitor pump stations.

LAB IS FINED FOR BOTCHING PAP SMEAR TEST RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: TARZANA FACILITY MUST PAY $558,000. IT ALSO SURRENDERS LICENSE AND 
AGREES TO INFORM CLIENTS THEY MAY BE RESCREENED.

<P>
A Tarzana medical laboratory that was closed earlier this year for 
misinterpreting the results of many pap smear tests has agreed to pay a 
$558,000 fine and surrender its license to screen the tests, according to state 
health officials. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the lawsuit filed by the state of California also requires 
Central Pathology Services Medical Group and its sister firm, Central 
Diagnostic Laboratory, to offer free rescreenings of all pap smear tests 
analyzed since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The pap smear test is used to detect medical problems in women, including 
cervical cancer, which kills an estimated 7,000 women in the United States 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was closed in April under pressure from the state, Central Pathology 
screened nearly 700,000 pap smears a year, more than half the number of 
screenings in Southern California. Central Pathology ceased operating after a 
health inspection found that the lab had misinterpreted 21% of a random 
selection of 1,103 pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
The state filed suit in May in Los Angeles Superior Court, asking for $3 
million in damages. Named as defendants were Central Pathology and Central 
Diagnostic, along with Dr. Allen Levy, a pathologist who owned both firms. 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic used Central Pathology to evaluate pap smear tests, but 
since April, Central Diagnostic has been sending smears to other independent 
labs. Central Diagnostic was not fined as a result of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Another condition of the settlement prohibits the top officials at Central 
Pathology from ever owning or operating a laboratory that provides pap smears 
tests and other cytology services in California. Those officials include Levy, 
Dr. Cyrus Milani, a lab director, and Harry Sagheb, secretary of the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Cooper, a spokesman for Central Pathology, said Levy believed the 
charges against him and his firms had been exaggerated, but chose to settle to 
put the incident behind him. Cooper said that some of 4,742 rescreenings 
uncovered previously undiagnosed problems, but none of the cases were found to 
be cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached Friday, when the department's deputy director and 
chief counsel, Diane Shell Campbell, signed the agreement. Copies of the 
settlement agreement obtained by The Times indicate that Levy and Sagheb signed 
on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the crucial part of the settlement is the agreement by 
both Central Diagnostic and Central Pathology, whose offices are located in 
Tarzana, to notify their clients that rescreenings are available. The officials 
said they had been dissatisfied with the effort the firms had made previously 
on their own to contact former clients. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology will be allowed under the settlement to deduct the cost of 
the rescreenings from the fine. But state officials said they do not expect the 
entire fine to be used in paying for the medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Beach medical firm, MetWest Inc., has agreed to purchase Central 
Diagnostics and has applied for licenses to operate with the Department of 
Health Services. The application is under review, a spokeswoman for the 
department said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. TO APPEAL JURY'S AWARD TO FIRED 
OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles announced Monday that it is appealing a federal jury 
award of $154,747 to a police officer who was fired three years ago after he 
refused to give police investigators a urine sample to be used to test for drug 
use. He was subsequently reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving the sample to police on Feb. 21, 1986, Officer Johnny Lee 
Jackson had the drug test done at a private hospital. It came up negative, but 
Jackson was fired for insubordination for not submitting to the original order. 
A six-member jury sided with Jackson on Sept. 14 after deliberating two days. 
</P>
<P>
The city's appeal, said Deputy City Atty. Arthur B. Walsh, is based on its 
continued belief that the Police Department had the right to demand the sample. 
Neither Jackson nor his attorney could be reached for comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAHONY CALLS FOR END TO SALVADOR MILITARY 
AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the brutal murders of six Jesuit priests and two lay persons in 
El Salvador, Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has called for an end to 
U.S. military aid to that country. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, who heads the Los Angeles archdiocese, held a a special Mass for the 
slaying victims at the Sacred Heart Chapel of Loyola-Marymount University over 
the weekend. He appealed to both sides in El Salvador's decade-old civil war to 
lay down their arms and negotiate peace, and to U.S. officials to foster 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"May we pray in a special way . . . that from the tremendous spilled blood that 
has so washed that landscape, that from that might spring the seeds of hope," 
said Mahony.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JUDGE ANGERED BY 2 ARTICLES IN THE 
TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial reacted angrily Monday 
to publication of two stories in The Times on Sunday, calling their appearance 
"insensitive" and "prejudicial" at a time when unsequestered jurors are 
deliberating the fate of Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he was most concerned 
about a cover story in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, which four jurors said 
they saw. The story, which dealt with child molestation, was about an unrelated 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Five jurors said they saw an article on Page 1 that discussed the impact of the 
McMartin ainvestigation on Manhattan Beach, where the nursery school was 
located. The jurors, however, said they did not read the articles and said 
their deliberations, which began Nov. 2, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, in a prepared statement, said both articles referred to the effects 
of child molestation allegations and noted that both "were intended to discuss 
broader societal issues reaching well beyond the facts of any particular case."

<P>
One man was killed and another was slightly injured in a traffic accident 
Monday on Interstate 5 near Las Pulgas Road, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Robert Kennedy, 18, of Thousand Oaks was killed in the accident, a CHP 
spokesman said. Richard Greenberg, 28, of Berkeley was treated for minor 
injuries at Tri-City Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1:34 a.m. when Kennedy, traveling north on I-5 in 
his 1965 Ford Mustang, ran off the freeway north of Las Pulgas Road in the Camp 
Pendleton area, the spokesman said. His car struck a cable in the center 
divider and landed back on the highway facing west, where it was struck by a 
van driven by Greenberg, the spokesman said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illegal alien was stabbed to death and two others were wounded Sunday night 
as they crossed the border on the Tijuana River flood-control levee near the 
San Ysidro port of entry, a police spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rogelio Cota, 32, of Sinaloa, Mexico, was the third victim this year to die at 
the hands of border bandits, said Bill Robinson of the San Diego Police 
Department. The two unidentified men traveling with Cota were treated for minor 
stab wounds at Mercy Hospital and released to Border Patrol agents, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 8:20 p.m. Sunday, two undocumented men reported to Border Patrol agents 
that they were attacked by robbers while attempting to cross into the United 
States along the flood-control channel, 175 feet west of the end of Virginia 
Avenue, Robinson said. Agents and San Diego police went to the scene and found 
Cota lying on the bottom edge of the south levee, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego homicide detectives will investigate, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, there were seven killings in the international border area that 
appeared to be robbery-related, Robinson said. So far this year, there have 
been 50 robberies along the border, an increase from 42 robberies in 1988, 
Robinson said.

Two women remained in critical condition Monday at the UC San Diego Medical 
Center burn unit after firefighters pulled them from their burning Kearny Mesa 
condominium Sunday night, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, responding to the call about 7:17 p.m., found Lila Sathre and 
Geraldine Spatheis, both 60, lying unconscious on the floor of their home in 
the 3200 block of Ashford Street, spokesman John MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained by 7:30 p.m.; damage to the condominium was estimated 
at $12,000, MacDonald said. Metropolitan Arson Strike Team investigators said a

CSUN TO TURN NEW PAGE WITH ROBOTIC LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for the new east wing of the Cal State Northridge library at first do not 
seem very user-friendly, considering that they include shelves too high to 
reach, bad lighting and a lot of noisy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, all of the more than 500,000 books there will be kept in random 
order. 
</P>
<P>
But what sounds like a librarian's nightmare will work fine for the mechanical 
staffers of what will be the world's first fully automated library, where 
robots will roam the aisles replacing and retrieving books, California State 
University officials say. 
</P>
<P>
They say human hands will be no match for Leviathan II, the $2-million, 
state-of-the-art automation system under construction at the San Fernando 
Valley campus. 
</P>
<P>
When it is finished, system designers say, Leviathan will hold 12 times the 
number of books per cubic foot as in a conventional library, allowing 
librarians to store the least-used of CSUN's million-volume collection in a 
fraction of the space the books now occupy. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons of the computerized card catalogue will, at the push of a button, 
command a team of six robots that can find a bin of books and bring it to the 
checkout counter in about five minutes. A human worker will pull the needed 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
University officials estimate that the system -- named after the biblical whale 
that "retrieved" Jonah -- will save taxpayers millions of dollars in library 
construction costs and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in operating 
costs. Leviathan works in the dark, does not litter and requires no heat. 
</P>
<P>
The system is being built as part of an $18.5-million library expansion project 
to be completed in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Because only robots will be allowed to work in the Leviathan section, students 
and faculty will not be able to browse through the shelves of books, a practice 
that most agree is a fundamental component of research. 
</P>
<P>
But if it works, Leviathan could be the answer for other university and 
research libraries faced with growing collections and dwindling space and 
money. Officials at the Library of Congress and Harvard University say 
librarians everywhere will be watching the CSUN experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries can't grow indefinitely," said Michael Shelly, a special projects 
director at the Library of Congress, which is expected to outgrow its Capitol 
Hill facility in three years. "The net additions to just our bound volumes are 
in the neighborhood of 250,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Harley P. Holden, curator of the Harvard University archives, said "we'll be 
taking a close look" at the CSUN system, because if it works, "it could be of 
great advantage." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics, who include mostly academicians who prefer retrieving books 
themselves, say CSUN's Leviathan could just as easily turn out to be a white 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the books will come that fast or easy; it just seems that so 
many things can go wrong -- the machinery screws up or the computer goes down," 
said Leonard Pitt, who has been a CSUN history professor for 27 years. "Maybe 
that's just the instinct of an old-fashioned professor." 
</P>
<P>
The critics point to a similar mechanical book-storage system that failed badly 
during an experimental run in the early 1970s. "Sometimes it worked and 
sometimes it didn't," said Nola Hartman, a reference librarian at the Monroe 
County Library in Bloomington, Ind., which built a new library to accommodate 
the system in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
It later cost taxpayers about $250,000 to remove the system, called a 
Randtreiver, and convert its area for more conventional use. Besides the 
frequent mechanical breakdowns -- it used giant magnets to lift metal book bins 
and place them on a conveyor belt -- the system was inefficient because it 
could only be operated by specially trained library workers. 
</P>
<P>
But robotics technology has advanced dramatically since then, say supporters of 
the CSUN plan. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced computer-controlled retrieval systems are working well at hundreds of 
industry warehouses, including the world's largest such system, in use for 
several years at the Ralphs Grocery Co. warehouse in Glendale. There, robots 
retrieve pallets of groceries weighing hundreds of pounds that are loaded by 
human hands onto trucks bound for area stores. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Eaton-Kenway Inc., builders of the Ralphs system, are also 
building the CSUN system. The firm is eager to prove that Leviathan will work 
and expects the idea to catch on at other universities. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Harris, director of library affairs for the Cal State University system 
and one of two men credited with pushing the idea, said he believes that the 
system will work and eventually be tried at other Cal State campuses. "This 
promises to be very successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drawback to the automated setup is that researchers will be unable 
to walk through the aisles. Books stored in the automated system will be 
available only to the robots, which are modified forklifts with mechanical 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
The robots will travel on rails in a narrow path between 100-foot-long aisles 
separating stacks of book bins that are 40 feet high. All of the volumes will 
have a computer bar code that tells Leviathan where to find them, or whether 
they have been checked out -- making formal arrangement by subject unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Some library users are complaining about the new system. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many times I've gone into the library and found a book I 
needed next to the one I was looking for," said David B. Friedman, a Fullbright 
scholar and attorney who also holds a doctorate in political economy from MIT. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts in the field of library automation, such as UCLA mathematics 
professor Robert M. Hayes, agree that browsing is a key element in the search 
for information. 
</P>
<P>
"The objections are not to automation but to equipment designs that interfere 
with direct access to the collection," said Hayes, considered a pioneer in 
information science for the last 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, however, said universities, because of rising construction costs, have 
no choice but to try experiments such as the one at CSUN. Without the 
technology, the nation's major universities, which are doubling their library 
collections every 15 to 20 years, would be buried in their books. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone in the field agrees that such systems are a compromise between 
academic and economic demands. 
</P>
<P>
"Even those like myself, who make a living in technology, haven't gotten out of 
the habit of browsing for the serendipitous discovery," said Richard Boss, a 
library automation consultant to the Office of the President, as well as the 
Boston and Los Angeles public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Common among the nation's larger libraries are computerized card catalogue 
systems that list available book titles when library patrons use a terminal to 
enter either the subject or author they are seeking. CSUN patrons will be able 
to operate Leviathan using the school's existing computerized card catalogue 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"But that still is dependent on the choices of those cataloguing the material," 
Boss said. "If I'm scanning shelves, I might be attracted by the cover, the 
title or the name of the person." 
</P>
<P>
Library administrators of the University of California system say they ran into 
similar opposition during planning for two book-storage facilities at Richmond, 
Calif., and UCLA. These traditional facilities employ library workers to shelve 
books. The facilities' advantage, officials say, is that they save space at 
individual libraries by storing the overflow of volumes from the system's nine 
campuses in two places. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still very legitimate wishes to have all the books be on the 
shelves," said Kay Loughman, head of user services for the system's northern 
regional library storage facility. "But we've been in operation for several 
years now and performed well, getting materials quickly, so most of the fears 
have been allayed." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Tanis, CSUN's dean of libraries, said Leviathan will be much quicker and 
more efficient than the University of California's method.

CITY AGREES TO PURCHASE AND RENOVATE AGED THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Monday completed arrangements to buy the 
dilapidated North Park Theater, authorizing payment of $905,000 in Community 
Development Block Grant funds for the 63-year-old movie house despite a staff 
recommendation that the best thing to do would be to demolish it and redevelop 
the land it sits on. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a recommendation that the city staff immediately seek 
$210,000 to begin repairs on the theater, which needs $1.4 million in 
renovations just to meet code requirements and $2.3 million more to become 
usable as a theater, according to a consultant's report. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase of the theater, owned by the Horizon Christian Fellowship, has been 
championed by outgoing City Councilwoman Gloria McColl, who said Monday that 
the building is historic and could become a cornerstone of the planned 
redevelopment of North Park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman-elect John Hartley, who will be sworn in Dec. 4, and community 
leaders made the same arguments before the council voted, 7 to 0, with Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor and Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer absent, to approve the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, a bitter critic of the purchase for two years, voted for 
it. He said afterward that a negative vote would not have affected the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
An engineering analysis of the building at 29th Street and University Avenue 
has shown that it is unsafe according to the city's building code because the 
roof is not adequately anchored to the walls, making it dangerous in high winds 
or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a large crack in a second-floor weight-bearing beam, and part of the 
mezzanine, built without a building permit, must be removed or rebuilt in 
accordance with the building code. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers' report also concludes that the theater could not support itself 
as a performing arts institution. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote cleared the way for the city to begin soliciting suggestions on 
how to renovate the building and perhaps turn it into a working theater again. 
It also established an agreement between the city and the State Historic 
Preservation Office that will require the city to consult with the state agency 
before any renovations are made. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was necessary before release of the block grant funds by the 
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The state agency will 
determine whether the theater is eligible for listing on the National Register 
of Historic Places.

TRIAL ORDERED FOR 3 HELD IN 'NIGHTMARE' DOUBLE SLAYING, FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: SURVIVOR DESCRIBES THE ATTACK. HEARING PROVIDES A GLIMPSE OF THE 
MIDDLE-CLASS DRUG TRADE IN L.A.

<P>
Three men were ordered to stand trial Monday in a brutal, cocaine-related 
double-murder case dubbed "Nightmare on Orange Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge David M. Horwitz ordered that the three be held to 
answer on seven counts -- including murder, attempted murder, burglary and 
arson -- after a preliminary hearing that has been in progress sporadically 
since April. The three will be arraigned in Superior Court on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional finale to the proceedings, a victim who survived despite burns 
over 80% of her body testified -- her head and hands still swathed in bandages. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and two other people were bound with electrical cords and 
stuffed into a closet with pillowcases over their heads, then doused with 
gasoline and set afire last Jan. 30 during the course of a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old survivor -- who described herself as a former secretary who 
became a $400-a-week drug messenger for one of the victims -- testified that 
she was also raped and shot but managed to flee the fire-engulfed building. 
</P>
<P>
The charred remains of Lee Gottstein, 57, and his wife, Sylvia Carruth, 45, 
were found by firefighters in an upstairs closet in their Spanish Colonial 
fourplex on South Orange Grove Avenue in the Mid-City area. Authorities said 
they died of asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
The three suspects -- Lonnie Lewis, 29; his brother, Jerome Martin, 22, and 
Derek Bloodworth, 26 -- could receive the death penalty if convicted in the 
special-circumstances case. Martin was also ordered to stand trial on a rape 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings offered a glimpse of the middle-class drug trade in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gottstein apparently oversaw a flourishing rock cocaine business from the 
Orange Grove address and a second apartment on Crescent Heights Boulevard, 
where the drugs were stored, according to testimony from his surviving 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
She said she delivered small rocks in plastic bags to addresses all over town, 
collecting $50 for each. She also smoked cocaine, she admitted, "but never 
during working hours." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Wilkinson, the survivor -- 
whose name is not being published because she is an alleged rape victim -- 
described the events leading up to the robbery and murders, breaking down in 
sobs as she told of lapsing into unconsciousness and waking up at County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she had known "Lee and Sylvia" for several months before "the 
accident." They had gone to a play and dinner on Jan. 30, then returned to the 
Orange Grove apartment, where she and Sylvia did "just a little" drugs and were 
feeling mellow and talkative. They were listening to the stereo in an upstairs 
guest den when, the witness said, Gottstein received a call and then a visit 
from a man she knew only as "Lonnie," who was accompanied by his brother. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing "a thumping noise like someone being thrown against a wall," the 
women were called downstairs, where they were forced at gunpoint to lie down on 
the floor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept telling us not to say a word; that if we did, they'd blow our heads 
off," the woman testified. 
</P>
<P>
After more than an hour, during which she was raped, the woman said the three 
victims were marched upstairs, where the bedroom had been ransacked. The 
brothers tied their hands behind their backs, put pillow cases over their heads 
and ordered them into a walk-in closet. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee was begging and pleading with them not to do it that way . . . that it 
didn't have to be that way," the woman said. "Sylvia was crying. 
</P>
<P>
"They poured gasoline in the closet, then I could hear something being pushed 
up against the door and they lit the match. I could hear screaming." 
</P>
<P>
After pushing her way out of the closet, the woman said she tried to hide under 
the bed but was shot in the arm and buttocks and left for dead by a man wearing 
red and white Nike shoes and gray jeans, the clothes she remembered Lewis 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
She waited a few minutes, then fled the burning house, doused her burns with 
water and lay on the lawn until paramedics arrived. She said she was 
hospitalized for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported finding Bloodworth sleeping in a garage two blocks away with 
stolen jewelry belonging to the Gottsteins in his possession. Lewis was 
arrested a few days later in Green River, Utah, Martin in Denver. All three are 
being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Isaacson, who represents Lewis, said the defense will 
attempt to show at the trial that the prosecution's star witness was so "based 
out" on cocaine on the murder night that she was unable to perceive and recall 
accurately, or perhaps that she was herself involved in a plan that went awry 
and purposely "fingered" the wrong suspects.

SIGNATURE EFFORT FAILS IN BERNSON RECALL BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge businessman's attempt to recall Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson failed Monday, and Bernson said he will ask a council committee to 
study possible changes in the city's recall process to prevent what he called 
"political harassment." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the recall effort, led by Walter N. Prince, owner of a janitorial 
service, were unable to collect the signatures of 17,622 registered voters from 
Bernson's northwest San Fernando Valley district. Petitions with the required 
number of signatures had to be submitted to the city clerk's office by 5 p.m. 
Monday in order to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Prince did not submit any petitions to the clerk's office Monday, saying he had 
gathered only about 13,000 valid signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shy of the mark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince said his group, Citizens United to Recall Bernson, gathered 22,000 
signatures, but about 9,000 of those were from people who lived outside 
Bernson's district or who were not registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Prince has accused Bernson of siding with large landowners and developers on 
zoning issues such as the proposed 1,300-acre Porter Ranch residential and 
commercial development. He also criticized Bernson's plan to use a 
redevelopment agency to upgrade a run-down area along Parthenia Street in which 
Prince owns property. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson last week put the redevelopment plan on hold to give property owners an 
opportunity to upgrade the Parthenia Street area themselves. He said the recall 
effort stemmed from a narrow group of property owners, including Prince, who 
are resisting improvement of the area. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 28, Prince published a second notice of intention to recall Bernson, in 
effect starting a new recall effort in which he has until March to obtain the 
necessary number of signatures. Prince will not be allowed to include the 
signatures his group gathered for the failed recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson called the second attempt to recall him "political harassment" and said 
he will ask the council's Rules and Elections Committee to study whether 
provisions in the City Charter should be changed to prevent repeated recall 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there should not be the ability for the same people with the same 
complaint to issue new petitions upon the failure of a previous attempt," 
Bernson said. "This basically amounts to extending the political process during 
the entire term of the officeholder." 
</P>
<P>
The charter currently bars a second recall attempt from starting within six 
months of a special recall election in which the council member prevails. But 
it permits repeated recall attempts after previous ones fail to force an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson also said the charter should require backers of failed recall drives to 
turn in their signatures to the city clerk. He said he doubted Prince collected 
as many as he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to make a big deal about it," Bernson said, but "it's important 
that these changes be made." 
</P>
<P>
Prince also has complained about the recall process. The requirement that 
recall proponents collect more than 17,000 signatures -- 15% of the district's 
registered voters -- is onerous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Bernson won reelection with nearly 12,000 votes.

UNITED WAY TO FOCUS ON L.A. DEMOGRAPHIC 'MOSAIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The steady influx of foreign investments into Los Angeles County and a 
population boom among the region's minorities is prompting the United Way of 
Los Angeles to refocus the aims and tactics of its fund-raising programs, a 
report by the charity showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Findings in the report -- United Way's Environmental Scan 1990 -- show that 75% 
of all births in the county are to minorities, an increase that will make 
whites a minority in metropolitan Los Angeles in about three years. The report 
also projected a county population increase from the 8.7 million recorded in 
the 1980 census to 9.9 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"The United Way has to be more receptive to the changes in our community," said 
Maurice J. DeWald, chairman of United Way's Strategic Planning Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the task force that wrote the report said the study will be 
instrumental in shaping policies of the United Way, which raises more than $80 
million annually for more than 350 health and social welfare agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they said, the findings will force United Way of Los 
Angeles to improve fund-raising efforts among foreign-owned concerns and small 
businesses. The report says 95% of all companies in the county have fewer than 
50 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Pisano, chairman of the task force, said many foreign-owned companies do 
not donate to United Way because "giving isn't necessarily part of those 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
"The study is an effort to understand the economic and social forces so that, 
as the United Way plans and does work, they'll have a basis on which to plan," 
said Pisano. 
</P>
<P>
He said the growing ethnic diversity in the region offers many advantages but 
could create several problems for both government and the local United Way, the 
second-largest United Way branch in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a mosaic of people, and that's a strength," said Pisano, whose task 
force -- made up of business, government and community leaders -- initiated the 
study 18 months ago to formulate more effective relief and fund-raising 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"But that strength could become a weakness. The community could grow apart. 
Diversity could become divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Glaring signs of division already are evident, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
Figures in the study show that a declining need for low-skilled laborers now 
threatens to permanently trap many of the county's 1.3 million poor in a cycle 
of poverty and crime. "It means you have a maldistribution of income," said 
Pisano. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "it's more difficult for workers to climb up from 
low-paying, low-skilled jobs. They cannot scale the corporate ladder." 
</P>
<P>
Such findings parallel a recent report by UCLA which also shows a widening gap 
between the rich and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United Way study found that: 
</P>
<P>
* The city's population is aging slower than in many other cities because of 
the predominantly young ethnic residents. 
</P>
<P>
* Two out of five households countywide have incomes of less than $20,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly 40% of all single-parent households in the county live below the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
* Dropout levels at county high schools are lowest among Asian and white 
students.

COMPUTER AGENCY BONUSES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council approved a $26.2-million fiscal 1990 budget Monday 
for its nonprofit computer agency that includes $49,500 for bonuses and 
suggestion awards for agency managers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
The budget continues the San Diego Data Processing Corp.'s record of 
distributing far more in bonuses, proportionately, than any of the city's 
quasi-public agencies or the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has given out more than $200,000 in bonuses to its employees over 
the past five years, including $10,000 payments to Executive Director Robert 
Metzger in fiscal 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger and Councilmen Bruce Henderson and Ron Roberts defended the payments 
Monday as necessary to keep the agency competitive with private-sector computer 
firms in attracting and keeping top personnel. But Councilman Bob Filner 
suggested that the bonuses were excessive when added to top executives' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, for example, will be paid about $111,000 during the fiscal year that 
concludes June 30, 1990, and will be eligible for a bonus equal to 10% of his 
salary. LEONARD BERNSTEIN

ACTRESS, PRO-CHOICE LEADER HIT BISHOP'S BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leader in California's abortion-rights movement and a well-known actress 
traveled to San Diego Monday to blast Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher for 
denying Communion to Lucy Killea, a Catholic pro-choice candidate for the 
vacant 39th District seat in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an absurd battle, and we're outraged," said Holly Hunter, who was 
nominated for an Oscar for her role in the movie "Broadcast News" and who later 
appeared as the woman whose fight for abortion rights took her to the U.S. 
Supreme Court in the television movie "Roe vs. Wade." 
</P>
<P>
Maher released a statement about his views Monday that, although not referring 
to Killea, compared abortion to the killings of six Jesuit priests last week in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the priests "we raise our voices in shock and horror," Maher's 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, when similar savagery takes place in the abortion clinics of our own 
land, we allow it to happen without a whimper." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the Horton Grand Hotel, Hunter and Robin Schneider, 
executive director of the California Abortion Rights Action League, said Maher 
was out of line in trying to intimidate Killea, a 67-year-old practicing 
Catholic, and for "going out of his way" to align himself with "anti-choice 
fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
"We've had hundreds of angry calls," Schneider said. "It's obviously a case of 
a public official trying to make an example of a woman. People came to this 
country to flee religious persecution, and now you have a graphic example of it 
in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter conceded that abortion is an emotional issue but said that, of the 
thousands of letters she has received since taking a pro-choice position in 
1982, only two have been "hostile" and were from anti-abortionists who oppose 
her views. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Killea might benefit from the bishop's stance and gain the votes to 
defeat Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley, her opponent, Schneider said, in 
this case, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, her religion is dear to Lucy," she said. "Lucy Killea did not 
deserve this kind of attack. We admire her for her courage, her integrity and 
decided to stand up for her."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED IN BEATING OF COUPLE WHO WERE ATTACKED 
BY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two youths have been arrested and a police investigation is continuing into an 
apparently unprovoked attack on a young San Fernando Valley couple by a group 
of at least a dozen teen-agers, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Orr, 19, of Reseda and a 17-year-old youth have been arrested in 
connection with the Friday night attack on Jim Peske, 20, of Granada Hills and 
Kelly Kearny, 19 of Tarzana, said Detective Phil Quartararo. They are charged 
with suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quartararo said Orr and the 17-year-old were part of a group of about a dozen 
teen-agers who chased the couple and beat them unconscious outside an apartment 
complex near Burbank Boulevard and Lindley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at a fast-food restaurant on Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana, 
Quartararo said. Peske, Kearny and Maria Cruz, 18, of Mission Hills had stopped 
at the restaurant to use the restrooms when the women were approached by a 
group of young men. After Kearny and Cruz spurned their advances, the men 
followed them in a fleet of about 10 cars to the apartment complex, Quartararo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz fled and eventually managed to scare off the attackers by yelling that she 
was a police officer, Quartararo said. Peske and Kearny were knocked 
unconscious, he said. Peske was treated at a hospital for head injuries and two 
broken fingers and released. Kearny suffered minor injuries.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are the pronouncements of the Roman Catholic bishops truly pro-life and are the 
bishops "the only moral conscience in our country," as Los Angeles Archbishop 
Roger Mahony has stated? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic bishops are caught in as much moral ambiguity as other religious 
leaders. In fact one can argue that the results of their teachings put them in 
the position of being pro-abortion and anti-choice. Abortion cannot be dealt 
with in a vacuum but must be seen in the wider context of family planning, 
contraceptives, the rights of both the woman and the fetus, and even the moral 
issues of poverty and world population. When one looks beyond the highly 
charged words of Catholic bishops on abortion and sees the increased need for 
abortions caused by their flawed teachings on human sexuality one can only 
conclude that they are pro-abortion and anti-choice. 
</P>
<P>
I served as a bishop of the Lutheran Church in America for most of the past 
decade. During this decade the Christian denominations made great strides in 
their ecumenical relations. It saddens me that the Catholic bishops are willing 
to sacrifice this progress in the name of a claimed superiority of moral 
position on the subject of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
I am less than satisfied with my own anti-abortion and pro-choice position but 
will live with the moral ambiguity of my position in preference to theirs.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the article a group known as Catholics for a Free Choice claimed that only 
20% of American Catholics agreed with the bishops in their strong stand against 
abortion. Twenty percent? Where does this group get its figures? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the vast majority of Catholics are solidly against abortion. This was 
seen very dramatically in the last presidential election. Post-election polls 
revealed that ethnic Democrats (largely Irish, Italian and Polish Catholics) 
crossed over and voted for George Bush because of the abortion issue. They made 
a significant difference in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics have been pro-life for 2,000 years. They are not likely to change 
now. The fact that Catholics For a Free Choice can only muster 8,000 members -- 
in a nation of over 50 million Catholics -- speaks volumes.

LET'S MAKE THIS THE LAST RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mojave desert tortoises would be well advised to stay deep in their burrows 
Saturday, for they will have 1,200 opportunities to get squashed, and therefore 
become even more endangered than they are now. The reason is that the U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management has overridden the protests of environmentalists and 
has approved the annual Barstow-to-Las Vegas cross-country motorcycle race. An 
estimated 1,200 whining, buzzing -- and thoroughly annoying -- machines will 
compete over the 135-mile course that bisects the habitat of the estimable but 
slow-moving tortoise. This is the California state reptile that was granted 
federal endangered species status earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The BLM did make some token concessions to the tortoise, but then sanctioned 
the race at virtually the last moment -- too late to be challenged in court. 
The first 25 miles will be rerouted through Ft. Irwin, the Army training center 
where the desert presumably already is pretty well banged up by tanks. 
Officials will survey the course beforehand to spot, and shoo away, any wayward 
tortoises. And the BLM has limited the number of cycles that can start at any 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
The race, first run in 1967, was controversial long before the plight of the 
tortoise became known. The contest was halted in 1975 because of environmental 
damage, but resumed in 1983 after a BLM environmental impact study claimed 
there would be no significant harm to the desert. That study still is being 
used to justify the race through territory being proposed as a national park. 
</P>
<P>
The major concession by the bureau is to approve no further races after 
Saturday before a full new environmental impact statement is compiled. If done 
properly, that document will conclude that there is no way to conduct such a 
cross-country race without causing irreparable damage to the desert -- and 
posing an unacceptable threat to the desert tortoise.

C-SPAN DOES THE UNCOMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one should be deceived by the English habit of understatement. They are, in 
fact, a people given to immoderate and mysterious enthusiasms. Take, for 
example, their unwholesome affection for spaniels or their unnerving fondness 
for the music of Frederick Delius. 
</P>
<P>
We Americans have our own quirks, of course. Among them is an obsessive 
interest in the one British institution the Founders rejected utterly -- 
monarchy -- and a studied neglect of another -- parliament -- from which so 
much of our democracy derives. At 5:00 this evening, the cable network C-SPAN 
will provide an opportunity to remedy that deficiency, when it broadcasts the 
British House of Commons' U.S. television debut. 
</P>
<P>
Those who tune in should not be misled by the implied dignity of all those 
chalk-striped suits, for the right honorable members of Parliament practice 
democracy of the bare-knuckled sort. The lines you'll notice running through 
the carpet in the middle of the chamber, for example, originally were put there 
to keep members at least the length of a sword's blade apart. 
</P>
<P>
There also is more than entertainment value to be had here. While the British 
Parliament may not be the world's oldest deliberative body (that distinction 
belongs to the Icelandic Althing) or the most raucous (that's probably the 
Israeli Knesset) when it comes to parliaments, this is definitely the major 
league. Because the British nation has no written constitution or separation of 
executive, legislative and judicial powers, as the United States does, 
everything happens in the Commons. Parliament has another chamber, the House of 
Lords, but like most hereditary aristocrats, they have in this century lost all 
powers save that of delay. 
</P>
<P>
Executive authority is exercised by the prime minister as leader of the 
majority party (now the Conservatives' Margaret Thatcher) and a cabinet. They 
all will be present and vocal in the Commons. Mrs. Thatcher is easy to spot: 
She sounds like Ronald Reagan might have, had he done his homework. On a good 
day, she is tough enough to kick-start the Concorde. Casual viewers may not 
want to waste time learning the names of her Cabinet members, as she sacks them 
with some regularity. Levity aside, there is perhaps no more fitting emblem of 
this year of democracy's triumph than the decision to broadcast the proceedings 
of the "Mother of Parliaments." But why stop there? Perhaps C-SPAN's program 
executives can cut a deal with Moscow to bring us the Supreme Soviet in action.

EUROPE WANTS TO HAVE ITS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush no doubt intends to honor custom by briefing the European allies 
after he meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 2-3. That's 
not enough. Why not get the Europeans' perspective before he holds talks on 
issues that affect them so fundamentally? As Saturday night's meeting in Paris 
of the 12 Economic Community heads of government so clearly showed, Western 
Europe does not plan to sit back and passively respond to developing events in 
Eastern Europe but expects to have a major policy-setting voice. 
</P>
<P>
This is hardly too much to ask. The claims and concerns of the Western 
Europeans deserve to be taken seriously. It is, after all, their continent, 
their security, their future that is most directly involved. Informing the 
Europeans about any superpower agreements after the fact is no substitute for 
full consultations beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimity that emerged from the Paris meeting over the weekend was no less 
impressive than the substance of what was agreed to. The EC, as France's 
President Francois Mitterrand summed up, is ready "to contribute with all our 
means to the establishment of a sane economy" in those countries that are 
struggling to crawl out from under the wreckage of Marxist planning and 
stifling state controls. But the essential precondition to aid for Eastern 
Europe must be a "verified return to democracy," with all that this implies 
about respect for human rights and a free and pluralistic political system. 
</P>
<P>
The EC also agreed -- with West Germany concurring -- that the changes now 
taking place must not lead to any revision of Europe's post-World War II 
borders. For the time being, this ought to dampen speculation about early 
German reunification. It also ought to provide further reassurance of the high 
value that Western European leaders place on maintaining stability during a 
time of rapid and radical change. If Bush and Gorbachev can match the level of 
thoughtful responsibility evidenced in Paris last weekend, all Europeans should 
gain.

THE THEOLOGY OF VIOLENCE: GOD'S WRATH PUNISHES EVIL; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE DENIAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A STRUCTURAL, COLLECTIVE OFFENSE AGAINST 
THE DIVINE AND NATURAL ORDER; VINDICATION IS A DIVINE AND NATURAL RESPONSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is from "Freedom Made Flesh, the Mission of Christ and His 
Church," by the Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, SJ, rector of the University of Central 
America, San Salvador, who was murdered last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We must unmask certain attitudes that are now widespread in the face of the 
global phenomenon of violence. We must make a distinction between the different 
forms that violence assumes, to enable us to talk about one kind of violence 
that is always evil and condemnable, and another kind of violence that on 
occasion may be absolutely necessary even though it undoubtedly entails evils. 
Given the circumstances, the latter kind of violence may be not only tolerable 
but even required. 
</P>
<P>
In many forms of violence we can see not only a real symptom of an intolerable 
situation but also an authentic moral denunciation of a prophetic cast. I shall 
begin by citing one of the most "violent" psalms, Psalm 58: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answer, you rulers: are your judgments just? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you decide impartially between man and man? 
</P>
<P>
 Never! Your hearts devise all kinds of wickedness 
</P>
<P>
 and survey the violence that you have done on earth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 . . . O God, break the teeth in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Break, O Lord, the jaws of the unbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 May they melt, may they vanish like water, 
</P>
<P>
 may they wither like trodden grass, 
</P>
<P>
 like an abortive birth that melts away 
</P>
<P>
 or a stillborn child that never sees the sun! 
</P>
<P>
 All unawares, may they be rooted up like a thorn bush, 
</P>
<P>
 like weeds which a man angrily clears away! 
</P>
<P>
 The righteous shall rejoice that he has seen vengeance done 
</P>
<P>
 and shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, 
</P>
<P>
 and men shall say, 
</P>
<P>
 "There is after all a reward for the righteous; 
</P>
<P>
 after all, there is a God that judges on earth." 
</P>
<P>
This is not an isolated strain or passage in the Old Testament. Such texts are 
abundant in the history of the Israelite nation. 
</P>
<P>
A bland conception of Christianity and of man, which ultimately leads to 
tolerance of unjust oppressors, has made us incapable of understanding such 
strong texts and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The "violent" tenor of this chastisement is surprising to us. The words could 
hardly be more harsh or cruel. The psalmist asks God to impose the full weight, 
not of his justice, but of his wrath. An all-powerful and enraged God must 
stand for the oppressed and inflict punishment on the unjust oppressor. The 
punishment is not left to God because the oppressed should not do the job; it 
is left to God because the oppressed cannot do the job, so God is asked to do 
it for them. 
</P>
<P>
This psalm makes it very clear that there are two forms of violence. One is the 
violence of the unjust oppressor; it is the original, aggressive violence. The 
other is the violence performed on behalf of the oppressed, the violence with 
which God punishes the unjust oppressor on this earth, whether that oppressor 
be an individual, a group, or a whole nation. In other words, good violence 
possesses not only the element of moral denunciation but also the elements of 
chastisement, punishment, and the rehabilitation of an order that has been put 
out of kilter by the abuses of unjust people in power. 
</P>
<P>
The point I want to stress is the duality of this violence. Both types of 
violence, the evil violence and the good violence, resemble each other in their 
force and their destruction. From a theological standpoint, however, this 
resemblance has no meaning or value. The thing that defines evil violence as 
the real violence is the fact that it is the violence wrought by the powerful 
on this earth who are acting unjustly. It is the injustice wrought against a 
whole group of people, against the defenseless and the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
The physical force employed in the process is an element of lesser importance; 
hence it is not the thing that characterizes violence as such. 
</P>
<P>
If people say that the punishment of unjust men in power, of what we today 
would call the structures of sin, ought not be performed by human hands -- at 
least not by the hands of people who are not lawfully constituted authorities, 
then they do not really understand what theology means by the punishment of 
sin. Viewed in theological terms, such punishment is not a sanction imposed by 
a judge in accordance with the dictates of some positive law. That would be a 
legal, external punishment. This can indeed be justified, but it does not 
tackle the problem in all its seriousness. From the theological standpoint, the 
punishment must be regarded as the natural outcome of an unjust action, as the 
natural fruit of sin. It is the response -- initially natural and only 
derivatively personal -- triggered by the unjust structure or the unjust 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The abuse of power can take many different forms that are unjust and violent. 
Three forms deserve to be denounced as particularly grave: 1) legislation that 
tries to perpetuate an unjust situation in the political and socioeconomic 
order; 2) political torture in all its forms; 3) falsehood propagated 
deliberately to misguide the consciences and conscious awareness of the people. 
This would be covert, legalized violence, but it remains the worst violence of 
all. It is unjust violence, or, the violence of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
So violence in the strict sense is the injustice that deprives man of his 
personal rights by force and prevents him from giving shape to his own personal 
life on the basis of his own personal judgment. The thing that differentiates 
real violence is not the method used but the injustice committed. This 
differentiating factor is highlighted most clearly in those structures that 
make a truly human life impossible. They constitute what is social injustice in 
the strict sense. When people become aware of their personal rights, social 
injustice gives rise to what is called revolutionary violence. This fact proves 
how closely and naturally violence is bound up with injustice. 
</P>
<P>
The institutionalization of this social injustice is the highest magnification 
of violence. There we find the worst form of violence; there violence reveals 
its full theological and human maliciousness. If people truly want to repudiate 
violence, it is to this institutionalized social violence that they must turn 
their attention. They must not be led astray by sporadic violent reactions to 
it, for it is in institutionalized violence that the mystery of iniquity 
infects man most gravely and that collective sin takes on its most serious 
form.

ENVIRONMENT: A FAILURE OF SOCIALIST PLANNING TURNED THE EAST BLOC INTO A 
GIGANTIC INDUSTRIAL DUMP. CAMPAIGNS TO CORRECT THINGS MAY HELP BUILD DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENN KEMBLE, Penn Kemble is a senior associate at Freedom House, a 
human-rights organization based in Washington. He was a public member of the 
U.S. delegation to the Sofia environmental meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This ancient capital spreads across a wide valley in the Balkans and was once 
famed for its mountain air. Today, when the breeze comes from the East, it 
crosses the huge Kremikovtzi metals plant, turns dun-colored and settles in an 
ominous layer over the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
Dirty air is a familiar enough problem. The difference here is the way the 
Bulgarian government -- and, until recently, other governments in the East Bloc 
-- have responded to pollution and to those who complain about it. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, members of a small Bulgarian environmental group, Eco-Glasnost, 
gathered in Sofia's Kristal Park to collect signatures on a petition to the 
government. Suddenly, militiamen and undercover police swarmed through the 
park. Petitioners and bystanders were kicked and punched, and more than 30 were 
hauled off in a police bus. The episode was watched by an amazed group of 
diplomats and other delegates to a large East-West conference on the 
implementation of environmental-protection provisions in the Helsinki Accords. 
</P>
<P>
As the Iron Curtain rises fitfully across Eastern Europe it is unveiling a huge 
industrial dump. This reality does not mesh comfortably with the preconceptions 
that many of us bring to such a scene. Socialism meant planning, and planning 
excluded the possibility of waste and toxic side effects. If there was 
something to be feared in the Eastern brand of socialism besides its military 
power, it was that it seemed all too tidy: broad, traffic-free avenues 
constantly swept clean by babushki, busybodies in the parks nagging you to keep 
off the grass and the monotonous tracts of high-rise apartment buildings. 
Uniformity, predictability, even sterility -- not this toxic wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
According to participants at the Sofia conference, Eastern Europe produces 
little more than one-third of the continent's gross domestic product but is 
responsible for two-thirds of its sulfur dioxide, the prime ingredient in smog 
and acid rain. Eastern European industry burns huge quantities of brown coal 
and uses twice the energy that the West does to produce the same dollar's worth 
of goods. Kaunis, a Lithuanian city of more than half a million people, has no 
waste-water treatment facilities whatsoever. A smuggled report from the 
Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences contends that in northern Czechoslovakia 
pollution shortens life expectancy by three to four years. (The government pays 
a bonus -- the workers call it "burial money" -- to those willing to live in 
the region for more than 10 years.) The catalogue of East Bloc eco-misfortunes 
quickly becomes a long one. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe's independent environmentalists feel neglected by the West. One 
asked me why Americans are so concerned about Amazon rain forests and the 
glaciers of Antarctica but so indifferent to the toxins being churned out by 
the socialist camp. Another complained that Western Europeans want to work 
mainly with official (that is, government-controlled) groups in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While the idea of socialist pollution may not mesh smoothly with some 
Westerner's intellectual preconceptions, others may grind their gears at the 
idea of an anti-socialist environmentalism. Many American conservatives are 
suspicious of environmentalism; neo-conservative theoretician Norman Podhoretz 
argues that environmentalism is the way socialism could come to America. Petar 
Beron, a leader of Eco-Glasnost and an official of the Bulgarian Museum of 
Natural History, says, "Environmentalists in the U.S. attack private 
corporations and are on the left. They think that because we attack the 
government we are on the right." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in preparation for the Sofia conference, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth 
(D-Colo.), a strong environmentalist, warned that human rights concerns could 
interfere with negotiations on the environment. But the arrest of Eco-Glasnost 
petitioners demonstrated that, in Soviet Bloc countries, environmental progress 
cannot be easily separated from progress in human and political rights. 
</P>
<P>
East European governments eagerly sign international anti-pollution agreements, 
but if their citizens can't hold them to these commitments, who will? When 
governments in this region investigate or fine a polluter, one branch of 
government is investigating or paying off another. And, when all else fails, 
the "socialist" polluter states harass or arrest their critics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, environmentalism may be emerging as one of the most 
effective forces for building alternative democratic institutions amid the slag 
heaps of socialist failure. From the campaign against the paper mills on Lake 
Baikal in the Soviet Union to the outrage about the radioactive explosion at 
Chernobyl, environmentalism has helped dissident democratic intellectuals reach 
out for mass support. Long-suppressed national pride finds a healthy outlet in 
demands to protect sites of natural beauty and historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental issues are now almost universally acknowledged to transcend 
certain aspects of national sovereignty. By the end of the Sofia conference, 
pressures forced the release of the Eco-Glasnost protesters, and a delegation 
of their leaders was even welcomed into the conference. And just one week 
later, the hard-line Communist Party chief Todor Zhivkov abruptly "resigned." 
</P>
<P>
But many Eastern European environmentalists contend that the West must demand 
more than freedom of information and expression in order to clean up the toxic 
threat from the East. It must also help in establishing alternative democratic 
institutions. For all the changes in the region, communists still control the 
governments. Now they are asking for grants of high-technology equipment and 
large sums of money to stop polluting their neighbors. But, as Polish 
human-rights and environmental leader Zbigniew Romaczewski recently told a 
gathering of Americans, "You have to work completely outside the old system. 
They will just spend your money and misuse the technology."

TILTING BUSINESS TOWARD THE LONG TERM; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: AMERICA IS HURT BY SHORT-TERM THINKING. SIX THINGS WOULD TAKE CARE OF 
THAT, BUT THEY COME WITH A PRICE TAG AND RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE IACOCCA, Lee Iacocca is the chairman of Chrysler Corp. and writes a 
syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've said that Washington and Wall Street should get a big share of the blame 
for the short-term thinking that pervades the American economy. Businessmen are 
guilty, too, but they don't set the rules. Here, from one businessman's point 
of view, is how the rules should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage companies to invest long-term. The big 1986 tax cut really just 
shifted more of the burden from individuals to corporations, which lost their 
tax credits for capital investment. Those credits should be reinstated, and the 
depreciable lives of capital investments should be shortened. The double 
taxation of dividends (the company pays and so does the shareholder) should be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
And the Federal Reserve has to bring interest rates down so American 
businessmen can afford longer-term investments. I pay three or four times as 
much for capital as my Japanese competitors do, and that means I've got to get 
my return three times as fast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase the savings rate. But first there has to be money to borrow, and 
the low savings rate in the United States denies us the capital we need for 
economic growth. It starts with a tax system that punishes savings and 
investment and rewards consumption. We should begin to shift the tax burden 
from the passbook to the credit card. When new revenue is needed, tax 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
IRAs and 401-K savings plans were among the best ideas Washington has had in 
years. But then the government limited the tax incentives. They should be 
opened up again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reward patient money. The money that is going into savings these days too 
often simply chases the fastest return. It doesn't sit still long enough to 
help fund long-range development. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if a capital gains cut will be put off until next year. Fine. Let's 
take the time to get more imaginative and stagger capital gains rates to reward 
long-term investment. How about a 40% tax on assets sold within 90 days, 28% on 
those sold between 90 days and five years, and no tax at all on assets held 
more than five years? Would that turn a few speculators into farsighted 
investors? 
</P>
<P>
Too much of the country's savings is tied up in the takeover game. That doesn't 
build American industry; it just cashes some of it in. We should require stock 
to be held for six months or a year before voting rights can be exercised, and 
eliminate interest deductions on debt picked up in an unfriendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage research and development. Lower interest rates would also help 
here, but we need to do even more. 
</P>
<P>
We need to rewrite the anti-trust laws to allow companies to do joint R&amp;D. 
The laws were written to promote competition within the United States, but now 
they're restraining competition between the United States and its economic 
rivals overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In the auto industry, for example, we should be allowed to conduct joint 
research in areas like safety, clean air and fuel economy. Companies overseas 
do it. When Washington passes another regulation, American companies all have 
to meet it independently while our foreign competitors put their heads (and 
their bankrolls) together to meet it more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Tax credits for research would help. So would a closer partnership between the 
government and our universities to promote research. And we need more 
protection from patent pirates overseas for the research that we do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promote exports. American companies don't have enough incentives to build 
long-term export operations. Volatile exchange rates make it extremely risky, 
for one thing. And we do nothing to encourage exports through our tax or trade 
policies. Our competitors overseas do. 
</P>
<P>
A 10% tax credit for U.S. exports would be roughly the level of incentives our 
competitors get through their tax systems when they send goods to us. We should 
consider it. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the key to more exports is open markets abroad. That's the 
government's job, and we've been wimps on this issue long enough. We've got the 
weapons to blast open some of those closed doors, and we should use them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Create a more stable business environment. Nothing discourages long-term 
thinking like short-term uncertainty. Why spend millions on a new plant that 
may not pay for itself for 15 years if, in the meantime, somebody changes the 
tax laws or flip-flops on environmental, safety or other regulations? Why do it 
if energy prices might shoot through the roof or drop through the floor? Or if 
interest rates and inflation might whipsaw the economy? 
</P>
<P>
If there's one big, overriding reason that we can't see more than a few months 
ahead, it's our $3-trillion national debt and the inability of the federal 
government to rein in its chronic deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on that debt soaks up about 83% of the country's total savings, and 
even worse, it forces the politicians to do one unnatural act after another. 
This year they pretended that $96 billion of new debt wasn't there, by putting 
it "off budget." 
</P>
<P>
It is there, of course, and when the piper shows up to get paid, he could turn 
the whole American economy upside down. There simply will be no long-term 
stability in this country as long as we keep adding to that debt. 
</P>
<P>
We aren't short-term thinkers in this country because we can't see to the 
horizon. We can see that far, all right, but we don't want to. We're afraid of 
what we'll see. And for good reason.

TRYPTOPHAN: UNCERTAINTY REIGNS AFTER BAN ON SALES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A $150-MILLION-A-YEAR MARKET HAD GROWN FOR THE AMINO ACID. NOW, EXPERTS 
ARE DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a golden rule of nutrition, it is a simple one: Too much of 
anything is bad for you. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it comes to amino-acid nutritional supplements, Americans seem to 
cling more to the creed that if a substance occurs naturally within the human 
body, one can never have too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy resulted in the development of an estimated $150-million-a-year 
market for the amino acid tryptophan in the United States over the last few 
years. Sold over the counter merely as a "nutritional supplement," it 
nonetheless has been used as an alternative drug by many people, sometimes on 
the advice of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tryptophan boom was stopped cold last week by state and federal orders 
banning sales of tryptophan while officials determine whether the substance is 
behind 287 U.S. cases of a rare blood disorder, 24 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
If tryptophan supplements are indeed responsible for the outbreak of 
eosinophilia, contamination is a key suspected cause. However, because 
tryptophan has a complicated metabolic pathway in the body, there is also the 
possibility that excessive doses could have built up one or more byproducts to 
harmful levels, scientists say. Tryptophan advocates, who point to years of use 
of the amino acid, say they think an obscure virus is at fault for the outbreak 
of the blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the amino acid really is to blame, the situation highlights the 
rise in a quasi-medical underground that sees amino acid supplements as a 
"natural" way to remedy a host of ills. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep well? Eating too much? Depressed? Suffering premenstrual syndrome? 
Try tryptophan, popular books advise. 
</P>
<P>
In training? Try arginine or ornithine to stimulate a "natural" steroid dose in 
your body that will bulk up muscles, the athletes' grapevine says. 
</P>
<P>
Or replenish your protein stores with leucine, isoleucine, valine and 
threonine, the grapevine also says. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the scientific research on which this type of advice is based 
is preliminary at best. More importantly, it was never followed up with the 
kinds of careful studies that would determine how much of these amino acids is 
enough -- and how much is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, critics express doubts about the usefulness of amino acid testing 
and therapy done in Southern California and elsewhere. In some cases, they 
suggest, amino acid supplementation could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrist Priscilla Slagle says she uses "a wide variety" of amino acids 
to treat her patients in Los Angeles, Encino and Palm Springs. Among them have 
been "hundreds" of people given tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that amino acid treatment is a frontier treatment, and I believe 
they do have powerful medical uses," Slagle said. "When people have illnesses 
and difficulties, their metabolic processes are disturbed. So we're talking 
about correcting and creating a balance again." 
</P>
<P>
Because she has concerns about quality control, Slagle tells her patients to 
use only products formulated by Tyson &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, which 
markets its amino acids only through doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tyson, president of the firm, said it does about $5 million a year in 
business through "a few hundred" doctors in the Los Angeles area and "a few 
thousand" throughout the United States and in Holland, Italy and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of tryptophan and other amino acid supplements consumed 
by Americans comes not from firms that market through doctors but from 
manufacturers that sell through retail outlets. These manufacturers count on 
popular health books and word of mouth to build a clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Because amino acid pills are classified as nutritional supplements, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has no controls over their manufacture or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and mainstream physicians have viewed the amino acid boom as 
relatively harmless, since they assume Americans taking the supplements are 
adequately nourished. 
</P>
<P>
But for a marginally nourished or malnourished person, they suggest, amino acid 
supplements might be harmful. Animal research shows that, when an animal is 
getting barely enough of the amino acids it needs, giving it a high dose 
produces illness much more readily than in a well-nourished animal, said 
Dorothy Gietzen, a biochemist who directs the UC Davis psychiatry research lab. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some scientists worry about damage to the liver from having to 
break down unused amino acids and possible damage from accumulation of 
byproducts of the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the elegant chemical factory that is life, there are four major components: 
</P>
<P>
* The genetic code provides a blueprint for all work the body does. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbohydrates provide energy to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Proteins direct the work. 
</P>
<P>
* Fats store energy for use later. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two different amino acids are known as building blocks in the protein 
division of this biochemical factory. Just as a child snaps together Legos to 
build a thousand fantastic structures, the body strings together amino acids in 
countless ways to make countless proteins. 
</P>
<P>
(Amino acids come in L and D forms -- the L form being the version that the 
body naturally uses and the version most commonly sold. The D form is a 
three-dimensional mirror image.) 
</P>
<P>
When a human lifts a finger, has a thought, or just breathes, it is because 
enzymes and other proteins are causing chemical reactions to make this use of 
energy possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the raw material for this comes only from taking in proteins in food, 
breaking them down in the gastrointestinal tract, and then absorbing the 
resulting amino acids into the bloodstream. Unused amino acids are broken down 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The body needs all 22 amino acids to work properly, and a deficiency in any one 
of them becomes the limiting factor for protein synthesis. However, in adults 
only eight "essential" amino acids -- including tryptophan -- must be derived 
from food. The other 14 important amino acids can be synthesized adequately by 
the body from the essential amino acids. (Babies need histidine but develop the 
ability to synthesize it as they grow.) 
</P>
<P>
Over short periods, the body harmlessly makes up for shortages of essential 
amino acids by digesting protein-rich muscle cells of its own gastrointestinal 
tract. Over long periods or in a marginally nourished person, deficiency 
results in disease, such as pellagra, caused by lack of vitamin B-6, which is 
produced when the body breaks down tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Where advocates of amino acid supplements and their critics disagree is in 
whether it is useful or harmful to try to boost the protein-building process by 
taking amino acid supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, of the Santa Monica amino acid firm, says keeping track of his amino 
acid levels and augmenting them keeps him from getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle and her patients say adding tryptophan to their daily health care 
rituals helps them sleep better and cures depression. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is thought to do this by boosting the brain's level of the chemical 
serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
But the same effect can be gotten at less expense and with less risk of 
overloading the body by merely drinking a glass of milk at bedtime, said 
Richard Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose work 
showing the serotonin link helped popularize tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman said he worries that the unregulated use of tryptophan means people are 
overloading their bodies with it and are doing so without knowing basic 
precautions. It will amplify the effects of certain antidepressant, 
hypertensive or antipsychotic drugs, and should never be taken before driving 
or dangerous activities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan's perceived status as a nutritional good guy provides an interesting 
contrast to the negative image of a sister amino acid, the flavor enhancer 
monosodium glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
The "glutamate" part of MSG is an amino acid and, like tryptophan, is a 
neurotransmitter, affecting the delicate cells of the brain and nervous system. 
It is excesses of glutamate that are blamed for that lethargic, headachy 
condition often called Chinese restaurant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the same people who worry that a Chinese restaurant is using MSG might go 
home at night and pop a tryptophan pill to help them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty in determining whether amino acid supplements are good 
or bad is that their various paths through the body and interactions with one 
another are complicated and, so far, not very well studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is we know very little about what happens in terms of flows of 
material in the body, especially for amino acids like tryptophan," said Dwight 
Matthews, associate professor at Cornell Medical College in New York City. 
Matthews tacks radioactive atoms onto amino acids and then traces their 
biological paths. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back to almost any eating studies and look at how amino acid levels 
change after a meal, but there's not a lot in terms of the kinetics -- what 
happens to it later," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Davis, biochemist Gietzen noted that studies of rats show that 
concentrations of amino acids in blood vary widely depending on whether the 
animal has been fasting or has just eaten, the composition of the most recent 
meal, and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a paper she uses as a reference, Gietzen said there are wide variations 
in amino acid levels in plasma that are considered average. For tryptophan, the 
average range in men is from 30 to 90 nanograms per milliliter of plasma; for 
women, it ranges from 24 to 76. 
</P>
<P>
With that wide a range, how can "normal" be determined, she asked. Before an 
individual's amino acid deficiencies could be reliably determined, she said, 
multiple blood samples would be required over the course of the day, for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had a consistent pattern, you could maybe recommend adding something 
to the diet -- but it would be better to add it to the diet than it would be to 
give it to them in pills," Gietzen said, "because they can tolerate it better 
in a combination with other amino acids than singly." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials who are investigating the outbreak of the blood 
disease eosinophilia might shed some light on how much tryptophan is too much 
if they find evidence of large doses in people who acquired the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supplements have been widely used for years is seen as 
an indication that the problem may be due instead to contamination of the 
crystalline tryptophan powder imported from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews of Cornell noted that, for his studies, he has to verify the purity of 
the amino acid powder before administering it to research subjects -- and he 
frequently finds contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"Time and time again I find some very strange impurities," Matthews said. 
"That, in my opinion, is one of the best places to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have developed good methods for assuring purity of their product, 
but a change in procedures could result in contamination of new batches, he 
said. In addition, the high price of Japanese amino acids would put economic 
pressure on U.S. companies to mix them with cheaper products produced with less 
quality control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the complex chemical methods used for making tryptophan and other 
amino acids often involve toxic substances such as hydrogen cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about natural foods," he said. "We're talking about 
specially prepared individual compounds. And in almost any case you can get the 
same effect just by eating right. You can pick natural foods that are a little 
bit richer in specific amino acids and get along just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wurtman, in his role as inadvertent father of the tryptophan craze, wants the 
FDA to classify amino acids as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is it probably works," he said of tryptophan. "But I would hope 
very much that the perception that these amino acids sold by the present route 
may be causing big problems will cause us to rethink completely whether we 
should allow them to be sold as so-called nutritional supplements."

HONORING THOSE WHO REMEMBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joyful, somber, contentious: The Simon Wiesenthal Center's National Tribute 
Dinner at the Century Plaza was a bit of all three. 
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister of Israel, gave the keynote speech after the 
evening's host, "Entertainment Tonight" personality Mary Hart, presented 14 
distinguished service awards for Holocaust remembrance in the performing arts 
to actors, writers, producers and directors who had worked on films and 
teleplays. 
</P>
<P>
Before the banquet, Secret Service and police personnel dotted the reception 
area outside the ballroom, sending guests through metal detectors and checking 
through purses, briefcases and camera equipment. Outside, cars bearing 
black-tie guests rolled past a line of candle-bearing protesters decrying 
Shamir's visit with chants of "Palestine, yes; occupation, no." 
</P>
<P>
Later, actor James Woods, accepting an award for his work in the 1978 
miniseries "Holocaust," referred to the protesters as "Nazis." The remark drew 
loud cheers from the capacity crowd of more than 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal, whom Mary Hart called "the attorney general for 6 million of his 
brothers and sisters," came from Vienna for the occasion. He sat on an extended 
dais with Shamir, the honorees and others, including Wiesenthal Center 
officials Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the center, and Samuel Belzberg, chairman 
of the board of trustees. Also on the dais: Los Angeles Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, Arnold Schwarzenegger, actress Leslie Ann Warren, and one of the 
dinner chairmen, MCA president Sidney Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Belzberg spoke of the center's accomplishments since its founding in 
1977, including its condemnation of events as diverse as the Carmelite nuns' 
establishment at Auschwitz, anti-Semitic lyrics in rock music and the election 
of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke to the Louisiana state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The other dinner chairman, publishing baron Robert Maxwell, was in England due 
to ill health, but his daughter Christine delivered a passionate speech -- 
written by her father -- which was one of the evening's best received. (Robert 
Maxwell's parents and four siblings died in the gas chamber at Auschwitz.) 
</P>
<P>
Dinner co-chairman William Belzberg presented the evening's awards with Mary 
Hart. The honorees included Mary Steenburgen ("The Attic: The Hiding of Anne 
Frank"); Martin Starger ("Escape From Sobibor" and "Sophie's Choice"); Arthur 
Cohn ("The Garden of the Finzi Continis"); Joseph Bottoms, Tovah Feldshuh, and 
Woods ("Holocaust"); Stanley Kramer ("Judgment at Nuremberg"); Dan Curtis and 
Jane Seymour ("War and Remembrance"), and Robert Cooper, Craig T. Nelson and 
Ben Kingsley ("Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story"). 
</P>
<P>
Each honoree was escorted to the stage by people who had personal experience 
with the Holocaust -- internees, liberators and sympathizers. The crowd seemed 
especially moved by Ann Gilbert, who had been taken into the gas chamber but 
somehow managed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Through the evening, speakers referred to the Wiesenthal Center's new 
$34-million facility, Beit Hashoah -- the Museum of Tolerance, here in Los 
Angeles. Scheduled to open by this time next year, the museum will include 
exhibits, educational facilities, a theater and archives to educate visitors 
about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The evening concluded with dinner Co-Chairman Alan I. Casden's introduction of 
Shamir. In prepared remarks, the prime minister saluted the movie industry for 
its role in keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive, and said: "As you know, 
our state does not happen to be located in the most friendly neighborhood. When 
Moses led us there he probably did not foresee the fanaticism, hatred and war 
that are endemic to the region. Perhaps I should have a word with Charlton 
Heston about that."

NORTH HOLLYWOOD BASEBALL COACH HIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Biegel, a 67-year-old retired teacher from the L. A. Unified School 
District, has been hired to coach the North Hollywood High baseball team, the 
school announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Biegel replaces Brian York, who resigned before the 1989 season after breaking 
an ankle. Fred Grimes, the school's football coach, directed the team to a 3-17 
record in York's absence. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired from Fairfax High in 1983, Biegel left a 28-year teaching 
career that included 17 years as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
He started as coach of the B basketball team in 1966 and moved to the varsity 
in 1969, where he stayed through '75. After two seasons as an assistant at Cal 
State Los Angeles, he returned to the Fairfax program in 1979 for two more 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked as the junior varsity baseball coach at Fairfax for six years, 
the last two in the '82-83 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Biegel played baseball at the University of Colorado in 1942 before serving in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
He is a 1951 graduate of Hunter College in New York City and readily points out 
that he is "67 and a half." He cited his desire to work with the players as the 
reason for resuming his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a bunch of kids waiting for someone who cares. . . . I can help some 
kids who didn't do well last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Stone, an assistant principal at North Hollywood who coached with Biegel 
at Fairfax, said Biegel will bring enthusiasm to the Husky athletics program. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a feisty guy and is extremely competitive. He'll bring a breath of fresh 
air to the department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school also hired Mike Rauseo to serve as a walk-on assistant to Biegel.

EL CAMINO REAL RECEIVES FORFEIT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fairfax High on Monday forfeited a City Section 4-A Division football playoff 
game to El Camino Real because of a shortage of academically eligible players. 
The first-round game was scheduled for Wednesday night at Canoga Park High. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax co-Coach Earl Smith, who is also dean of students, recommended to 
school administrators that the game be forfeited after Smith verified that nine 
of 27 players on the varsity had been declared academically ineligible. Fairfax 
administrators approved the recommendation and notified the City Section 
athletics office, which briefly considered ordering the Lions to play the game, 
but relented. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't force a team to play with 20 players or whatever," said Lee Joseph, a 
City administrator. "If we make them play and one kid gets hurt, they'd sue the 
hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax (3-5-1) finished third in the Metro League. El Camino Real (4-5) placed 
second in the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said substituting a team for Fairfax was not considered -- a thought 
that Smith admitted had crossed his mind last week when Fairfax defeated 
last-place Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them what the situation was, that we might have to forfeit and asked if 
they were interested in going (to the playoffs in place of Fairfax)," Smith 
said. "They said, 'No thanks.' 
</P>
<P>
"With our record, I'm not sure we deserved to be there anyway." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real will play North Valley League champion Granada Hills (10-0) in 
the second round Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills defeated the Conquistadores, 21-0, last month. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real co-Coach Mike Maio said that he was informed of the forfeit 
before Monday's practice. The team wasted little time shifting gears. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and told us, and we went back in and fired up the Granada Hills 
game film," Maio said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the 4-A bracket, Crenshaw defeated Banning in a California 
tiebreaker Monday and will play at San Fernando (5-5) in the first round.

U.S. TO LEVY 'DUMPING' DUTIES ON PHONES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE DECISION MEANS DUTIES OF MORE THAN 100% WILL BE CHARGED ON SOME 
SMALL-BUSINESS PHONE SYSTEMS IMPORTED FROM JAPAN AND TAIWAN. THE RESULT MAY BE 
HIGHER CUSTOMER PRICES OR FEWER IMPORTS OR BOTH.

<P>
The U.S. International Trade Commission in a split decision ruled Monday that 
small business telephone systems imported from Japan and Taiwan cause harm to 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and smaller domestic U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision opened the way for U.S. Customs starting next month to start 
collecting "dumping" duties of more than 100% from importers of one Taiwan 
maker and several Japanese makers. 
</P>
<P>
That is expected to result in either higher U.S. customer prices or fewer 
imports, or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member commission voted 3-3 on an anti-dumping petition filed by two 
U.S. makers, AT&amp;T and Comdial Corp. of Charlottesville, Va. The tie vote 
means acceptance of their claims. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, which earlier ruled that office phone systems with 
from two to 256 lines were being "dumped" in this country, will instruct U.S. 
Customs in the first part of December to start depositing higher duties, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in a similar case involving imported South Korean telephone 
equipment was postponed for 60 days at the request of the Korean manufacturers, 
they reported. 
</P>
<P>
The "dumping margin" on Japanese imports, to be reflected in higher duties, was 
fixed by Commerce at 179% for products of Matsushita Electric, 137% for those 
of Toshiba Electric and 158% for all others. 
</P>
<P>
The margin on Nitsukoi products from Taiwan was set for 130%, while the 
Commerce Department found no "dumping margin" for other Taiwanese brands. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. small business telephone systems are made mostly in the states of 
Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi and Colorado, the ITC said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T welcomed the commission decision, declaring in a statement that "we 
are confident that all U.S. manufacturers can be very successful in this market 
once unlawful pricing ends." 
</P>
<P>
It added that the decision will enable AT&amp;T to "continue to be able to 
bring its innovative strength to this marketplace and bring new, even more 
innovative solutions to small business customer needs."

About $25 million would cover the cost of cuts and upgrades in the

The move came later on a day on which the company announced in Japan that it

retirements" for those younger than 55.

<P>
Two similar reduction efforts earlier this year resulted in about 2,000 jobs 
being trimmed from the firm's corporate and defense systems groups.

<P>
Reductions will be sought within information technology group operations in 
Hunt Valley, Md.; Johnson City, Tenn.; North Texas, and the Texas cities of 
Austin, Temple and Houston.

No More KHJ-TV: KHJ-TV, one of the nation's oldest television stations, 
announced that it has received approval from the Federal Communications 
Commission to change its call sign to KCAL, California Nine, on Dec. 2. The Los 
Angeles station, which broadcasts as Channel 9, first went on the air in 1931 
as Don Lee Television's W6XAO. It became KHJ-TV in 1951 and was acquired by 
Walt Disney Co. a year ago.

Texas Instruments to Cut Jobs: Texas Instruments Inc. said it plans to cut up 
to 1,500 jobs, mainly in the United States, citing a slowdown in demand for its 
computer memory chips. The cut would represent a reduction of slightly less 
than 3% of its U.S. work force if all the cuts came in the United States. The 
company said it would take a pretax charge against earnings of about $55 
million in the fourth quarter.

Sprint, PacBell Offer 800 Service: US Sprint and Pacific Bell said they will 
join forces, if California regulators approve, to provide national toll-free

having to arrange the local and long-distance portion of their network

DANGEROUS TOYS ON RISE, GROUP WARNS

A 4-year-old Connecticut boy is just one victim of a barrage of potentially 
dangerous toys that will bombard parents looking for perfect toys as holiday 
gifts for children, a consumer group said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that it's a more dangerous situation this year than we've remembered 
in our 18 years of toy surveying," Ann Brown, chairwoman of the Consumer 
Affairs Committee of Americans for Democratic Action, said in releasing the 
group's annual toy safety and quality report. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was joined by Judy Lavoie and her son, Greg, of Bethel, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Greg had two operations after perforating his eardrum with a packing stick 
included with the Pepsi-Cola/Coca-Cola Delivery Truck, listed by the consumer 
group as one of its most potentially dangerous toys. 
</P>
<P>
Lavoie said the manufacturer, New Jersey-based Buddy L Corp., told her that the 
package clearly states the stick is a part of the packaging and not the toy, 
but she displayed an unopened model of the toy she said she bought over the 
weekend that didn't include that information. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer temporarily suspended shipment of the trucks after Greg's 
August, 1988, accident and printed larger stickers warning parents that the 
packing rod should be discarded, said George Fink, Buddy L senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not feel that after shipping 750,000 of these units, with one complaint 
that we had a dangerous toy," said Fink, explaining why the company didn't 
recall the trucks already on the market to include the warning sticker. 
</P>
<P>
"Toy safety has become a contradiction in terms," according to the consumer 
group's 135-page report that surveyed 51 toys. 
</P>
<P>
Brown blamed the influx of more dangerous toys on the "powerlessness" of the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has jurisdiction over toys, used 
to be just be a toothless tiger," she said. "I'm afraid the tiger has now 
fallen over dead." 
</P>
<P>
Brown criticized the panel's lack of a quorum of three commissioners since 
January. Early Saturday, the Senate confirmed Jacqueline Jones-Smith as the 
third commissioner and chairwoman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"We will look into every product on that list . . . and make a determination as 
to whether any action is necessary," said CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites CPSC statistics that estimate there were 142,000 toy-related 
injuries in 1988, an increase of 11,000 over 1987. Nursery product-related 
injuries to children under 5 totaled 72,000 in 1988. The ADA report, which 
previously cited only toys, this year includes infant and children's products. 
</P>

QINTEX AUSTRALIA ASKS TO BE PLACED IN RECEIVERSHIP 
</P>

<P>
Qintex Australia Ltd., the media and property empire built by entrepreneur 
Christopher Skase, went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off 
complete liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-starved company, which has been in a downward spiral since its 
proposed buyout of the MGM/UA movie studio collapsed in October, asked an 
Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group's foreign and 
Australian banks from breaking up the company. 
</P>
<P>
The court appointed David Crawford and John Allpass, chartered accountants with 
KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords, as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia 
and 28 associated companies, stripping Skase of an operational role in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's debt now totals $1.6 billion, and the company is expected to sell all 
of its resort and property assets -- including a high-priced 232-acre 
oceanfront parcel in Orange County -- while retaining its television network 
and perhaps its local television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Buchanan, a lawyer representing Qintex, told the Supreme Court in 
Victoria state that it is vital for Seven Network and other Qintex television 
stations to continue operating so they do not lose their broadcasting licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers, including the right to hire and 
fire, sell Qintex assets and borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc., a Beverly Hills firm that is 43% 
owned by Qintex Australia, said that firm now has "little contact" with Qintex 
Australia and still hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
Qintex Entertainment has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to 
advance needed cash after the aborted MGM/UA deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Madden, director of research at Prudential Bache in Melbourne, said the 
receivership is akin to a Chapter 11 filing in the United States. The banks 
wanted to avoid a liquidation, he said, because the sale of all Qintex assets 
would cover only a bit more than half the outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
"What is certain now is that all the resorts will go, and all the land will 
go," Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex purchased the 232-acre parcel near Dana Point in southern Orange County 
last July and took an option on a 115-acre property nearby with the intention 
of building a luxury resort. 
</P>
<P>
But the company earlier this month forfeited its right to the second parcel 
when it missed an installment payment. Local real estate experts said the price 
Qintex paid for the larger property -- $132 million -- was exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in 
Hawaii. Princeville announced Monday that the extensive renovation work under 
way at the site has been suspended.

Interest Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.0 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.61%, down from 7.68% last week. Another $8.0 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.40%, 
down from 7.51% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills 
sold for 7.52% on Oct. 23 and six-month bills averaged 7.35% on July 31. The 
new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.86% for 
three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,809.80 and 7.79% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,627.90. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

PEOPLE: LIVE ENTERTAINMENT STILL HAS NO REPLACEMENT FOR MENENDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Live Entertainment Inc. said it needs more time to find a replacement for Jose 
E. Menendez, its slain chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez and his wife Kitty were killed Aug. 20 at their home in Beverly Hills. 
Police are continuing to investigate the case, but no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Live, a distributor and retailer of video and audio entertainment, announced 
several appointments and the creation of a new unit for acquisitions and new 
business, Live Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Devendra Mishra, executive vice president-operations, has been named president 
and chief operating officer of Live. Meshra, prior to joining Live three years 
ago, worked for RCA for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Live said Chief Financial Officer Roger R. Smith, who was named acting 
president of Live following the death of Menendez, has been named president of 
the new unit. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it was continuing to search for a successor but warned that 
the process may take a while. 
</P>
<P>
"This search is not expected to be concluded quickly, and the management 
structure announced today is seen as extremely capable of handling all aspects 
of the company's business, however long it takes to find a new chief executive 
officer," said Peter Hoffman, acting chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The company also announced appointments of two well-known entertainment 
executives to its board: Alan Hirschfield, former chief executive at 20th 
Century Fox and Columbia Pictures Industries; and Cy Leslie, founder of 
Pickwick International and founder of MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group.

THIEVES REAP RICH HARVEST OF GREEN GOLD; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: PILFERING IS BOLDER, MORE ORGANIZED. AVOCADO RUSTLERS ADD TO WOES 
OF GROWERS ALREADY IN TROUBLE AFTER SUCCESSIVE WINTER FREEZES AND A HEAT WAVE

It was no Brinks robbery. No gold, gems or greenbacks were involved in the 
heist. But the cargo was valuable enough for bandits last February to hijack a 
truck at gunpoint and knock its driver unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of the crime was a remote road in the Valley Center area of North San 
Diego County. And the bounty was about 10,000 pounds of avocados. 
</P>
<P>
The case is just one of scores reported by growers in Southern California this 
year as the price of avocados has soared because of poor weather. The 
pear-shaped fruit has attracted thieves -- more organized than ever -- intent 
on cashing in big on the dark-green, delicious goods. 
</P>
<P>
"In days gone by there was a little petty thievery by workers. It has now 
become a very organized kind of effort," said Warren Currier, executive 
secretary of the Avocado Growers Assn. in Fallbrook, a town in North San Diego 
County that is a major avocado producer. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is costing California avocado growers an estimated $10 million a 
year at least. And it has caught the attention of the California Avocado 
Commission in Santa Ana, which has allocated $268,000 this year for a program 
to try to alert law enforcement agencies to the seriousness of avocado theft 
and cut off the marketing outlets for the stolen fruit. 
</P>
<P>
With 74,600 acres of avocado groves and about 6,500 growers, California 
produces about 90% of the nation's avocados, with an annual value of $200 
million. Irvine Ranch in South Orange County has the state's largest avocado 
grove with 1,250 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Successive winter freezes have stunted the state's yield of avocados for two 
years. If that wasn't enough, a searing heat wave last April hit the tender 
young fruit. As a result the next 12-month avocado harvest is expected to be 
even more meager, about 23% smaller than the 324 million pounds produced in the 
growing year that just ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The scarce supply has raised prices that avocado growers get for the fruit from 
an average of almost 17 cents a pound in the 1986-1987 growing year to an 
average of 62 cents in the latest year. As the avocado harvest winds down, 
wholesalers have been paying as much as $1.60 a pound and supermarkets have 
been selling them for up to $1.69 each. 
</P>
<P>
But increasingly, avocado growers are losing profits to rustlers, who for two 
years have been busily plundering the largely unprotected avocado groves in the 
coastal hills stretching from San Luis Obispo through Orange County to the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves usually come at night or on weekends. They pick as much fruit as 
they can reach, stuff it into burlap bags and wait for it to be hauled away by 
a passing vehicle, according to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Or they may not bother to pick at all. In the evening they may simply help 
themselves to the bins of avocados that pickers have filled and placed on the 
roadside to be trucked to packing houses. 
</P>
<P>
Often the next day footprints, tire tread marks, holes cut into fences, broken 
irrigation pipes, discarded flashlights, an occasional pile of avocados missed 
in the dark or empty bins are telltale signs of the thieves' work. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen avocados then are sold at a substantial discount to restaurants, 
road stands, packing houses and fruit brokers, say growers and law enforcement 
authorities. Among those thought most likely to be dealing in stolen avocados 
are brokers and packing houses that offer to pay cash for the produce, thus 
leaving no record of who sold it to them. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben Hofshi, a grower, grove manager and co-owner of the Del Rey Avocado 
packing house in Fallbrook, figures that, even if a thief, who must take a 50% 
discount when he sells his loot, a few weeks ago could have pocketed $150 for 
an hour of picking. 
</P>
<P>
Although avocado theft had reared its head previously when avocado prices rose, 
industry observers say that this time the thieves seem to be much more 
organized. "There is a larger-scale operation going on," said Robert Siemer, 
also a part owner at Del Rey Avocado. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1,500 pounds of avocados disappeared from a cooler at Bear Creek 
Ranch in Fallbrook, and some of the fruit was discovered in a packing company 
truck at the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, still nestled in boxes 
sporting Bear Creek Ranch labels. 
</P>
<P>
"We now believe a larger network of thieves is involved," said Lt. William 
Flores, commander of the San Diego County sheriff's substation in Fallbrook 
that has been spurred by the Bear Creek incident to conduct a larger 
investigation of organized avocado theft. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado industry officials say there is no way of knowing exactly how many 
avocados have been stolen and resold. Estimates of grove yields are imprecise, 
and many avocado thefts aren't reported or go undetected, growers and law 
enforcement authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said that, in the past two years, his office has recorded 18 avocado 
thefts in Fallbrook. But he said he suspects "many more go unreported" and that 
some avocado thiefs are prosecuted for crimes that are easier to prove, such as 
for stealing a pickup truck or for drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's substation in Vista, another avocado-growing area in North San 
Diego County, has received about 50 reports of avocado theft in the past 12 
months, a patrol sergeant there estimated. And the nearby Valley Center 
sheriff's substation arrested 11 avocado theft suspects in the last picking 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Crane, industry affairs director for the California Avocado Commission, an 
organization created by the state Legislature in 1978 to help avocado growers 
jointly promote avocado consumption, said a survey of state growers last year 
showed that at least 5% of the crop's value was lost to theft. At that rate, he 
said, the avocado industry in California was robbed of $10 million during the 
last year. He added that he thought that estimate was low. 
</P>
<P>
Groves suffering the greatest losses from theft tend to be owned by people who 
live and work in the city and thus can't keep a close watch on them. "The 
percent of absentee owners in the avocado industry is higher than for any other 
commodity in California," Crane said. He estimates that "a couple hundred" 
residents of Orange County, which has lost most of its avocado groves to 
housing tracts over the past 20 years, own avocado ranches in less-developed 
nearby counties. 
</P>
<P>
But even some growers who live in houses on their groves say they have been 
plagued by repeated pilfering. 
</P>
<P>
Al Vangelos, president of CALAVO Growers, a Tustin-based cooperative of 2,500 
California avocado growers, said: "I have had growers call me and tell me they 
literally lost everything. One grower said he had lost about 20 acres over a 
period of a year. He felt helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hendrick, a retired engineer who with his wife owns an avocado ranch in 
Temecula, a city in the Santa Rosa Mountains of southwest Riverside County, 
estimates that in the past growing year he lost $10,000 in potential profits to 
thieves who probably entered his property on weekends when the grove manager is 
off duty. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, earlier in the year, the head of the picking crew and a packing 
house representative toured his grove, looked at the avocados on its trees and 
estimated it would yield 20 bins. But, when it came time for his crew to 
harvest, "they went in to pick and came out with one bin," Hendrick said. "It 
kind of burns you up." 
</P>
<P>
John Bartlett of Valley Center is one of a few growers who have managed to 
catch thieves red-handed on their property. He recollects that, on a Wednesday 
evening last April, he was taking an evening jog with his two dogs when the 
dogs darted into a group of trees. 
</P>
<P>
When he followed, he said, "two pickers dropped out of the trees and ran. I 
also saw a third." His wife summoned the sheriff, who caught two of the three 
trespassers. They were convicted of theft and sentenced to 60 days in jail, 
Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in July, Bartlett said, he traced tire tracks along his grove to a car 
that was filled with 400 pounds of avocados in the trunk and back seat. He said 
the authorities "impounded the car but lost the pickers. They got away." The 
very next day, he said, he found more fresh car tracks in his grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become an excellent tracker," Bartlett said dourly. Nonetheless, he 
estimates that this year thieves got away with 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of his 
avocados. 
</P>
<P>
Growers in San Diego and Riverside counties frequently complain that the law 
enforcement system there doesn't take avocado stealing seriously. Not enough 
avocado thieves are arrested, they say, and those who are prosecuted frequently 
receive light punishment. Under the state criminal code, the stealing of 
avocados worth more than $100 is a grand theft that can be prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor or felony. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith, a grove manager in Temecula, said he and a friend on the evening 
of July 17, 1988, heard suspicious noises and saw a truck inside a neighboring 
avocado grove. He said the two men then armed themselves with 12-gauge 
shotguns, arrested the suspects and turned them in to the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he had difficulty persuading the sheriff's deputies to press the 
case. He said he couldn't immediately determine who owned the grove, and the 
deputies that him that, without a victim to file charges, there was no case. "I 
got the feeling they thought there were more important things to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers concede that avocado thieves are not often apprehended 
because of a host of factors, including the difficulty of locating absentee 
grove owners and of patrolling many square miles of unpopulated orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Some grove managers say they believe that some workers who are hired to pick 
avocados for a grove owner at the same time may be setting aside a portion for 
themselves. Honest workers are often afraid to turn in the dishonest, they say, 
because of threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal view that the largest amount of fruit lost is embezzled by 
people legally on the" grove, contends Currier of the Avocado Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stem the avocado industry's theft losses, the California 
Avocado Commission this year launched a program aimed at shutting down the 
market for stolen avocados. The program, which will also provide monetary 
rewards for information leading to the arrest of avocado thieves and seek to 
obtain more vigorous law enforcement, is paid for from an annual assessment 
fund on growers' avocado sales. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's new anti-theft program has expanded the scope of the state's 
longstanding consumer protection program for inspecting packing houses to make 
certain that avocados have been certified for proper weight and ripeness. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with a four-month pilot program that was launched in July, the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture's division of inspection services has also 
been sending field representatives to restaurants, roadside fruit stands, 
farmers markets and fruit brokers to hunt for avocados that are not properly 
certified or receipted. 
</P>
<P>
Donella Boreham, who supervises the state's anti-theft program, said that, by 
state law, anyone who buys or transports avocados must have proof of ownership 
in the form of a receipt that shows where the fruit was purchased. If such a 
receipt can't be produced, she said, chances are good that the avocados were 
stolen, and the state can confiscate them. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the threat of confiscation will deter restaurants and other 
businesses from buying hot avocados, purposefully or unwittingly. Between July 
1, when the anti-theft inspection pilot program started, and Oct. 21, 12,765 
pounds of avocados were confiscated and discarded or distributed to charities, 
Boreham said. 
</P>
<P>
Although avocado growers say they welcome the new marketplace inspection 
program, they generally concede it won't solve the problem of theft. Just six 
state inspectors are assigned to Southern California, a number that soon will 
increase to seven as a result of an additional allocation from the Avocado 
Commission. And the inspection program does nothing about arresting avocado 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Some avocado industry officials praise a special task force set up by the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department for catching and prosecuting thieves and 
suggest it as a model to be duplicated by other avocado-growing counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ken Cozzens, who was instrumental in establishing 
the task force in 1985, said it is based on close cooperation among growers, 
the Sheriff's Department, the farm bureau, the agriculture commissioner and the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Cozzens said that, although other fruit such as lemons and oranges have also 
been stolen from groves, "the big target has been avocados" because of their 
greater value. 
</P>
<P>
Cozzens said the entire legal system in Ventura County has become determined to 
catch and punish avocado thieves. "We have sent guys to state prison for three 
years for theft of avocados," he said. He also said that, in the Santa Clara 
Valley, which is his enforcement area, avocado theft seems to have abated 
significantly with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as California's avocado growers prepare for a new growing year, they are 
putting up more chain link fences topped by barbed wire. Some are also hiring 
private security guards. Carl Lindgren, general manager for Treasure Farms, a 
farming company that operates the grove on land leased from the Irvine Co., 
said that, although thefts have been limited in his grove, he plans to beef up 
night patrolling because of the expected short crop next year. 
</P>
<P>
This year more growers are also saying they will harvest as soon as possible, 
rather than let their avocados hang on tree limbs longer while they collect 
weight and size that adds to their value. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are talking about picking early so there will be no fruit there for the 
thieves to take," a grove manager said.

MARROW-TECH TO RELOCATE IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marrow-Tech, a New York-based biotechnology firm that has developed 
laboratory-grown versions of human skin and bone marrow, is moving its 
operations to San Diego, company officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marrow-Tech has signed a five-year lease for a 20,000-square-foot facility in 
the Calbiochem Center in La Jolla, said Arthur J. Benvenuto, the company's 
president and chief executive officer. Marrow-Tech plans to complete its move 
by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
The company will augment its staff of 20 employees, but Benvenuto declined to 
say how many new workers Marrow-Tech will hire once the company relocates. He 
said he is recruiting primarily research-and-development and manufacturing 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
"We opted for San Diego because it's one of the major hotbeds of biotechnology 
research in the country," said Dr. Ron Cohen, Marrow-Tech's vice president of 
corporate and government affairs. "There are also several institutions, for 
example UCSD and the Salk Institute, that are sensitive to the need of 
nurturing companies like us. They also offer a great pool of talent that we can 
draw from." 
</P>
<P>
Marrow-Tech, founded in January, 1986, held its initial public stock offering 
in June, 1988, raising $6 million, and has yet to generate revenue except for 
interest income. Next year, the company will introduce its first line of 
products: laboratory-grown human skin that will be used by manufacturers to 
test cosmetics, drugs and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have been under increasing pressure from animal-rights activists 
to find alternatives to laboratory animals in conducting tests to determine 
whether a product is safe for humans.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy apparently is entering a recession, causing flutters in the hearts 
of stock market investors, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. With this being the time to take losses for tax 
purposes or gains if they are available, stocks continue the move downwards, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego stocks managed to buck the trend and made significant moves. A 
new high was recorded by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric at $44.125, an indication 
that investors are seeking a safe haven for their money. SCEcorp, its proposed 
merger partner, likewise hit a new high of $38.625. Magma Power, an alternative 
geothermal energy company, also reached a new high, $24.50. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co. gained $4.75 for the week as investors began to realize that, of the 
entire group of wholesale clubs, the Price Co. has the lowest price-earnings 
multiple, the largest sales per outlet and highest gross margins. Price Co.'s 
multiple is 21.7 times earnings. That's cheaper than the 30 times earnings 
multiple of Pace Membership, which is to be purchased by K mart, and the 32 
times earnings multiple of Costco Wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed gained $1.50 as analysts began to realize that the recent sell-off from 
a high of $47.50 was overdone. The stock is now selling at 20% below its 
tangible book value and at a price-earnings ratio of six times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Biomagnetic Technologies recovered somewhat from the previous week's low of 
$5.25 and closed at $6.50. The company went public at $9 a share last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the nation's defense contractors were devastated in Monday's market as 
defense cutbacks loom on the horizon. San Diego defense stocks, which were 
already selling near their 52-week lows, have not yet reacted. In fact, Maxwell 
Laboratories reported strong first-quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, versus 
29 cents a share the previous year, and the stock gained $1.50 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new lows was TCS Enterprises at $3.125. One of the company's major 
shareholders is Lincoln Savings, whose assets are now in the hands of the 
Resolution Trust Corp. Another company hitting a new low was Great American 
Bank, which dropped to $7.125, where it is selling at less than 50% of its 
tangible book value. 
</P>
<P>
A new addition to the new list of lows was Henley Group, whose headquarters are 
being transferred out of San Diego. Apparently all the spinoffs and lack of 
earnings haven't raised investor confidence, as Henley stock recorded a new low 
of $55.75, down from its high this year of $74.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: U.S. TO UPHOLD PATENT ON 3D'S MODEL MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
3D Systems said the U.S. Patent Office has indicated it will uphold 3D's basic 
patent underlying its primary product, a machine that combines a computer, 
chemicals and lasers to rapidly build exact models of machine parts and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
A re-examination of 3D's patent was requested by Du Pont Co. in September, 
1988, based on alleged new evidence that might have called the patent's 
validity into question, 3D Systems said. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia-based 3D Systems is growing quickly because its machine, which in 
hours can produce models that formerly took days or weeks to make, is 
increasingly being sought by major manufacturers. In the nine months that ended 
Sept. 30, 3D Systems' revenue totaled $10.8 million, up from $2.67 million a 
year earlier.

rents on its properties, fell 5% to $1.3 million from $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its earnings declined because part of its rents are based on a 
percentage of the revenues generated by the companies that lease its 
properties. It said income from that part of its rent formula declined in the 
latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months that ended in September, Medical Properties earned $1.5 
million, up 4% from $1.4 million a year earlier. Revenues rose less than 1% to 
$4.1 million from $4 million.

'ACTIVE WEAR' PUTS WEEKEND AT CENTER STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: FREQUENT FASHION CHANGES AND SHARP PRICING HAVE MADE THE SAN DIEGO 
FIRM A LEADER IN ITS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SPECIALTY CLOTHING FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boosted by a licensing arrangement with ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov, a 
San Diego apparel concern called Weekend Exercise Co. has quietly become the 
nation's leading specialty manufacturer of women's dance, aerobic and exercise 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The company is growing at a 20% annual rate despite a recent leveling off in 
the market after a decade-long boom corresponding to the emergence of aerobics 
and fitness as a national preoccupation. The aerobics and exercise fad gave 
rise to a whole new genre of comfortable, form-fitting and stylish apparel 
that, for lack of a better term, has come to be known in the trade as "active 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Weekend's Marika, Baryshnikov and Jazzercise lines should exceed 
$50 million this year, or about 38% of the estimated $130-million women's 
active wear market as a whole, president Arthur Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson, 63, is a long-time San Diegan who co-founded Weekend in 1982 with 
retailer Ed Berner and Norm Zwail, who formerly was Danskin's sales 
representative for Southern California. Weekend Exercise now has 150 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend Exercise made its initial splash in 1983 with the introduction of the 
Marika line at prices 20% to 30% under competing lines. Weekend accomplished 
the price reductions by becoming the first active-wear company to move its 
manufacturing offshore, specifically to low-cost plants in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the line caught the notice of international star Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who in 1986 went to the company and proposed a cooperative 
agreement to introduce a higher priced Baryshnikov signature line of dance and 
exercise wear. Baryshnikov chose Weekend after querying retailers and dancers 
as to who the quality clothing makers were. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Baryshnikov and Weekend signed a licensing deal calling for 
Weekend to manufacture clothes bearing Baryshnikov's name. Three years later, 
the Baryshnikov line is doing $15 million in sales and accounting for 30% of 
Weekend's revenue. Sales of the Baryshnikov line have grown at a 30% to 40% 
clip per year since introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov has final say over design of the line and visits Weekend's Spruce 
Street office two to four times a year to review new products, Levinson said. 
Debra Joester of Hamilton Projects, Baryshnikov's New York-based licensing 
agent, said the "timing and chemistry of the agreement have been perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov is "delighted with the product and very pleased with the sales," 
Joester said, noting that the line has expanded from the classic ballet styles 
originally envisioned by Baryshnikov to include more casual dancing apparel. 
Capitalizing on the clothes' crossover appeal as casual attire, Weekend and 
Baryshnikov are in the process of introducing a new line of street wear. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekend-Baryshnikov team's "timing was right for their type of product 
because body wear and leg wear have expanded beyond the old notions of dance 
wear," said Karen Monget, a news editor at Women's Wear Daily. "There are so 
many crossover trends. A lot more people are wearing body-wear pieces as outer 
wear these days." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend's Marika has steadily grown in popularity to the point that is the 
largest-selling mid- to upper-priced trademark in women's exercise wear in the 
nation. It is sold in specialty dance and exercise clothing shops as well as in 
department store chains including Broadway, Emporium-Capwell, Bloomingdale's, 
Macy's and sporting goods chains including Oshman's and Sportmart. 
</P>
<P>
"They forced a lot of other body-wear manufacturers that had long enjoyed 
dominant positions to scramble and drop their prices as well," said Sally Goll, 
executive editor of Sportswear International, a New York-based fashion trade 
publication that focuses on the casual sportswear market. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike a lot of moderately priced lines that are moderately designed as well, 
they combine fashion with a very sharp price point," Goll said, a reference to 
Weekend's "very close to the bone" prices. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson was wrapping up a 30-year career as an apparel and sundry importer in 
1982 and considering retirement when old friend Ed Berner, founder of the 
Fashion Conspiracy retail chain, approached him about forming a "low-key 
business" together. One possible venture, above several other ideas, struck 
them as particularly promising. "We became aware of the growth in the aerobics 
wear industry, that the goods were primarily being made in Southern California 
and that the people involved did not have real heavy business backgrounds," 
Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
All three factors combined to spell a business opportunity for Levinson, who 
had spent much of his career learning the ins and outs of offshore 
manufacturing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. If aerobics wear was being 
made stateside, Levinson knew he could produce similar clothing at 
substantially lower cost offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Weekend Exercise was born with the prime objectives being to have fun and 
not work too hard, Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson and Berner ran their aerobics wear idea past Norm Zwail, then a 
frustrated regional sales representative for Danskin, which at the time was a 
dominant dance wear manufacturer but losing market share. Zwail, who knew the 
Southern California exercise wear market as well as anyone, thought Weekend's 
idea was sound and joined the company as a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a heavy-duty pay cut," Zwail said. "I went backwards to go forward, and 
the gamble paid off." 
</P>
<P>
To project a fashion-conscious image, Weekend also committed itself at the 
outset to offer up to five new fashion looks per year, more than the two or 
three new looks then being offered by active-wear manufacturers. (Weekend now 
introduces new fashions almost monthly.) 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that Weekend's Marika line has been able to respond much 
more quickly than most competitors to changes in styles, according to Bill 
Schaaf, senior vice president and general merchandise manager at 
Emporium-Capwell department stores in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical fitness market is constantly looking for new things," Schaaf 
said. "They are fashion-conscious people," he said of aerobics clothing buyers, 
and Weekend "can deliver it very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Sales started slowly but gathered momentum as the Marika line demonstrated 
quality as well as price advantage, Levinson said. The company weathered a 
potential crisis in 1984 when Jane Fonda's signature line of women's athletic 
wear was introduced, casting doubt on whether Fonda would leave "room for a 
schleppy little company like ours." But the Fonda line soon faltered, and 
Weekend survived to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
Berner sold his interest last year as part of a recapitalization of the 
company, and new investors include prominent San Diegans whom Levinson declined 
to identify. One investor he did name was Thomas Volpe, a San Francisco 
investment banker who formerly was a top-level executive at Hambrecht &amp; 
Quist investment bankers, well-known for helping start up many Silicon Valley 
high technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Volpe said he invested in Weekend because of his belief in 
Levinson's integrity and because the "company never seems to stand still. They 
are always thinking of new things to do, and that's why they have grown as well 
as they have." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson said a public stock offering is definitely a possibility eventually 
but is not in the company's immediate plans.

BAY BRIDGE REPAIRS PUT PERCOL IN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reopening of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Saturday was something 
of a grand opening for Fountain Valley-based Percol Polymerics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical company is only a few weeks old -- its Orange County office 
doesn't even have all of its furniture and there are only four full-time 
employees. Yet Percol has spent its first weeks using its patented polymer to 
fill potholes and tiny trenches left in the Bay Bridge by the Oct. 17 
earthquake, which caused a 50-foot section of the span's upper roadway to drop 
onto the lower section. 
</P>
<P>
"We can launch our product in a grand style," founder Ransome Wyman said. "It's 
an unusual opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Just days after the 7.1 quake, Wyman was called in because his polymer -- 
Transfixx -- is faster than traditional road-patching materials. 
</P>
<P>
Transfixx is a combination of two liquids -- not much thicker than water -- 
that is mixed into the hole with a solid material such as concrete. Once inside 
the hole, the liquid expands to fill any empty space and helps adhere different 
sections of pavement. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Percol has applied about 2,000 gallons of Transfixx to the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The substance is considered superior to other existing formulas because it's 
stronger and takes only two to three minutes to dry as opposed to the normal 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We can put traffic on it in about 10 minutes," said Robert Coe, a Caltrans 
maintenance superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Percol has done experimental work for Caltrans -- Transfixx was used on a 
five-mile stretch of the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County -- but the Bay 
Bridge job is its first piece of contract work. 
</P>
<P>
Wyman and a partner developed Transfixx in 1983 for the quick repair of Air 
Force runways. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal was to be able to restore a bombed runway within four hours of attack 
and that is in any weather, hot or cold, wet or dry," said Wyman. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force tested the product at a NATO base in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Transfixx worked just fine but the repairs took a lot longer than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It took four days," Wyman said. "The crews were not properly trained."

CHANNEL 7 CATCHES FLAK FOR ALLOWING PRESS COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: POLITICAL WATCHDOG GROUP TELLS POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR STATE 
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO LEAVE THE AIR, BUT COMMENTATOR SAYS HE WILL STAY 
UNTIL HE MAKES A DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A political reform group is criticizing KABC-TV Channel 7 for allowing Bill 
Press to remain on its news broadcasts while conducting an exploratory campaign 
for state insurance commissioner. Press says he will remain on the air until 
making a decision to run. 
</P>
<P>
"KABC should have asked Bill Press to leave the moment he even began thinking 
about running for office," said Mark Haarer, acting director of California 
Common Cause. "The airwaves have a tremendous impact on how people think, and 
this relationship will have a tremendous impact on his potential candidacy. It 
is unfair and may be an abuse of the airwaves for a candidate or potential 
candidate's own selfish need." 
</P>
<P>
While Common Cause has complained directly to KABC when similar cases arose in 
the past, it has not done so this year, Haarer said, because its executive 
director, Walter Zelman, also is exploring the possibility of running for state 
insurance commissioner. Zelman began a leave of absence from his job Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not surrender my constitutional rights when I went to work on radio and 
television," Press responded in an interview. "I think it is outrageous for 
anyone to think I would have to. As a civil libertarian, I find that 
offensive." 
</P>
<P>
KABC General Manager Terry Crofoot and news director Roger Bell did not return 
phone calls from The Times. A broadcaster seeking public office does not come 
under federal regulation until becoming an official candidate. If he or she 
remains on the air after that, the station is subject to equal-time requests 
from other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Press also co-hosts a weekday talk show on radio station KABC-AM (790), whose 
general manager, George Green, has no objections to Press remaining on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't made an announcement to me, and until he makes an announcement, he's 
not a candidate," Green said. "Our position is that he has to announce his 
candidacy, and we'll treat that situation as we did we with Bruce Herschensohn" 
-- another KABC-AM commentator who continued in his job until he declared 
himself a U.S. Senate candidate in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But critics believe that what the Cap Cities/ABC-owned stations are doing is 
ethically wrong. Bill Zimmerman, campaign consultant for Conway Collis, a Board 
of Equalization member who has declared his candidacy for insurance 
commissioner, contends that Channel 7's decision to allow Press to remain on 
the air gives him an electoral advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"For a minor office, there are all kind of studies that indicate that name 
identification is the single largest determinate of voting patterns," Zimmerman 
said. "If you don't have name identification, you have to spend a great amount 
of money to get it. Bill is getting tens of thousands of dollars of television 
time weekly and none of that is being disclosed as an in-kind campaign 
contribution by KABC." 
</P>
<P>
Press launched his self-described exploratory campaign Oct. 5 with a 
$250-per-person fund-raiser at a Beverly Hills hotel, and claims to have raised 
nearly $300,000. Press has also conducted Los Angeles and San Francisco press 
conferences on earthquake insurance and has participated in three candidate 
forums. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, an exploratory campaign is nothing but a device from keeping it an 
official campaign," veteran political consultant Joe Cerrell said. "Some people 
conduct exploratory campaigns when they're not sure if they are going to run or 
to keep a job or stay on the air. In Bill's case, I think it is a case where he 
wants to stay on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Press said he has yet to decide if he will officially seek the Democratic 
nomination for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks very good for me, but I have not made a final decision," Press said. 
"Running for statewide office is an enormous undertaking, particularly for 
someone who has never run for public office. I have to be sure all the elements 
are there before I make a final decision. If my final decision is to go, then I 
will resign my position, but not before." 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for all offices on the June ballot are required to file a 
declaration of intention with the Secretary of State's office between Jan. 29 
and Feb. 7, then must file nomination papers between Feb. 12 and March 9. Press 
could remain on the air without KABC-TV and KABC-AM falling under the 
equal-time requirements until turning in his nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
Press said that he has neither shied away from nor emphasized insurance-related 
issues on his commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I approach my job is to discuss the hottest issue of the day," Press 
said. "I only talk about insurance when it is far and away the biggest story of 
the day. I think I probably have talked about insurance three times in the past 
four or five months." 
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in four years that Common Cause has raised this issue. 
In 1985, Zelman wrote to Channel 7 and KABC radio to furlough Herschensohn. 
</P>
<P>
The stations rejected the request. Herschensohn resigned from both stations 
after announcing his candidacy on Channel 7, then returned after being 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Zelman questioned the propriety of Channel 7 allowing Press to give a 
farewell commentary Nov. 3, 1987, a day after announcing he would be resigning 
from Channel 7 to seek the 1988 Democratic Senate nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Crofoot, then KABC-TV news director, said at the time that the Federal 
Communications Commission had concurred with the station's decision to permit 
Press on the air and not offer equal time to his then-rival, Lt. Gov. Leo T. 
McCarthy, because Press had not qualified for the ballot yet. 
</P>
<P>
Press withdrew from that race before the June primary, rejoining Channel 7 in 
April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, stations must provide equal time to opposing candidates 
whenever a candidate appears on a broadcast outside of bona-fide newscasts, 
interview programs, documentaries and on-the-spot coverage of news events. 
</P>
<P>
The practical impact of the law forces candidates with jobs in the media to 
relinquish their positions during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The law also applies to actors turned candidates, which barred Ronald Reagan 
movies from the airwaves during his political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, when KHJ-TV inadvertently ran "Starfighters," a movie starring Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan, the station gave his opponent, Carey Peck, 16 minutes of air 
time to equalize the time Dornan was on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strictest interpretation of the law came when George Takei sought a 
Los Angeles City Council seat in 1973. Channel 4 refrained from showing 
animated versions of "Star Trek," which included him supplying the voice of Mr. 
Sulu.

THE HONEYMOON IS JUST BEGINNING FOR 'TRUE LOVE' DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a 22-year-old film student at New York University, Nancy Savoca 
won a couple of student film awards that convinced the novice director she 
could make it in the big time. After walking the graduation line in 1982, 
Savoca sat down with her husband, Richard Guay, and banged out a screenplay for 
a film called "True Love." Soon after, the young couple began innocently 
knocking on doors to get a Hollywood studio deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We had done nothing. We knew nobody," Savoca, now 30, said. "We were real 
cocky because we didn't know any better." 
</P>
<P>
The story Savoca was trying to sell was a multicharacter drama about the 
doubtful wedding of a young Italian-American couple in the Bronx. After the 
ceremony, the bridegroom wants to celebrate his wedding night drinking with his 
buddies instead of honeymooning with his bride. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice studios sent our script back unopened," Savoca said. "That way we 
could use it again, because it costs, you know, like 10 bucks to get those 
things copied." 
</P>
<P>
After several years of pounding on closed doors and kicking around in the film 
business as everything from production coordinator to assistant auditor, Savoca 
got fed up. She rounded up some investors and made "True Love" herself for less 
than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Using a cast of unknowns who worked for no money, "True Love" was completed 
earlier this year and won the Grand Prize in the dramatic competition at the 
1989 United States Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film got off to a 
rocky start in theaters because of what Savoca calls a wan marketing campaign 
by MGM/UA. But "True Love" is currently performing well in New York and opened 
solidly in Los Angeles theaters on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as these stories go, it is Hollywood who is knocking on Savoca's door with 
directing offers. With her career launched, does the director finally feel 
rewarded? 
</P>
<P>
"Relieved is a better word," Savoca said during a recent interview. In between 
trying to get "True Love" off the ground, Savoca had two children, both of whom 
her husband was busily trying to keep occupied during the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hardest thing was to keep up the energy and be persistent," said 
Guay, who co-produced the film. The couple has seen no money for their work, 
and may not if the film does not pay for itself in the box office. "We were 
completely naive -- that helped. We weren't intimidated by the process because 
we didn't know what it was all about." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the doors are finally open," Savoca said. "At the same time, after 
six years of this process, we're a lot more cautious. We're older. Our 
priorities have changed from what they were when we came out of film school. If 
you want to make the movies you want to make, you have to be cautious, because 
they're not so easily accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, there were fears that Savoca's script for "True Love" was too New 
York, that a marriage taking place in a small Bronx neighborhood was a slice of 
Americana that people had no interest in swallowing. The story was also busting 
out with a wedding invitation list of characters. Between the bride's and the 
bridegroom's friends and family, there were at least 25 fully developed roles 
in the film, which made reading the script a task in concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"The story shoves so many people in the reader's face that it's hard to tell 
who they are," Savoca said. 
</P>
<P>
To flesh out the characters and give studios an idea of what the film would 
look like, Savoca and Guay in 1985 sunk $22,000 of their own money into a 
9-minute trailer. With the reel in hand, the couple made the studio rounds 
again, and again they were rejected. But the trailer impressed a friend of 
theirs, film maker John Sayles, who led a small group of investors to get the 
project off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
After the film won the award in Park City, studios began bidding for rights to 
distribute "True Love." Most of them wanted to change what Savoca says is an 
honest ending to the film, an ending that basically leaves the troubled couple 
no better off then before their marriage. Savoca and Guay decided on MGM/UA to 
distribute because the studio offered complete creative control. 
</P>
<P>
But when the film opened in Los Angeles, Savoca was openly unhappy with MGM/UA. 
She held up a copy of The Times comparing the advertisements for "True Love" 
with Avenue Picture's "Drugstore Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
"This is MGM, a (major) studio, versus Avenue, an independent, and their ad is 
four times as big as ours," Savoca said (the ad was actually twice the size). 
"This is MGM saving money. It's extremely frustrating. Because if we hadn't 
done well, then I'd wash my hands. I'd say, it was a great learning experience 
and I'll move on to my next movie and do better." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Lorie, who heads MGM/UA's marketing division, was out of town and 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Savoca wants the film be a domestic hit so she can pay her 40-member cast the 
deferred salaries they forfeited during the 50-day shoot. But she is pleased to 
see that, as a result of the film, some of her unknown, non-union actors are 
breaking out. Ron Eldard, who plays the bridegroom, has been signed by an 
agency. The bride, Annabella Sciorra, has completed work on two feature films, 
including "Cadillac Man" with Robin Williams, and will soon begin a third. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go into this movie to make money. Nobody did," Savoca said. "You come 
in with the lowest expectations. You wish there could be guarantees, because 
nobody deserves to work that hard. For me, what I wanted for the movie was to 
get my foot in the door of this business because this is what I want to do with 
my life. I've accomplished that."

Each year, as an embellishment to its regular opera season, San Diego Opera 
offers a handful of solo recitals. Unlike opera productions, these programs 
represent more of a gamble for the music patron because they rely on the talent 
of a single performer. 
</P>
<P>
On a lucky night in February, 1988, for example, local opera buffs were 
rewarded with the sophisticated, polished artistry of Swedish baritone Hakan 
Hagegard. At Sunday night's Sherwood Auditorium recital by soprano Carol 
Neblett, however, lady luck was not smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Having made an auspicious Metropolitan Opera debut 10 years ago, Neblett should 
be at the acme of her career. But, judging from the evidence of Sunday's 
recital and her solo role in San Diego Opera's Verdi Requiem last season, this 
diva is experiencing vocal mid-life crisis. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for a host of problems -- unreliable vocal production, shortness 
of breath, an annoying vocal wobble -- Neblett simply cranked up the volume and 
emoted to beat the band. By comparison, Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth is 
positively catatonic. 
</P>
<P>
A few times during her program, Neblett aptly fused her emotional excesses with 
the demands of the music, notably in Massenet's fevered aria "Pleurez, pleurez 
mes yeux," from "Le Cid," and in the despairing "My Man's Gone Now" from 
Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess." 
</P>
<P>
But her opening German-language songs by Mozart were unstylishly melodramatic; 
Faure's evanescent "Apres un reve" has rarely been given such a loud, coarse 
treatment, and Ravel's "Vocalise" received little more than an approximation of 
its sinuous vocal line. 
</P>
<P>
Neblett's most serious undertaking was a neo-Romantic song cycle by Thomas 
Pasatieri, who also served as the soprano's accompanist. Pasatieri's "Sieben 
Lehmannlieder," a fairly recent setting of seven poems by the late Lotte 
Lehmann, proved agreeable and pleasantly eclectic, filled with the discreet 
echoes of Poulenc, Wolf and Mahler. 
</P>
<P>
Like his fellow American composer Samuel Barber, Pasatieri knows how to craft a 
melody that is inherently sympathetic to the voice. Pasatieri played Mozart and 
his own compositions fluently, but in the Massanet aria, his misreading of the 
score made Neblett's work even harder. 
</P>
<P>
The program's penultimate piece was Pasatieri's satirical song "Vocal Modesty," 
which begins with the line "I just love my voice." It may be quite possible to 
love Neblett's grand, dramatic vocal instrument. But the manner is which she 
now uses it is downright painful.

ARTIST'S STARDOM DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: RAUL GUERRERO, WHO CALLS HIMSELF A "WORKING-CLASS ARTIST," HAS LONG BEEN 
KNOWN IN SAN DIEGO. BUT HIS FAME IS GROWING AND NOW INCLUDES A SPREAD IN 
"VANITY FAIR."

<P>
He is modest, serious, private -- not the kind of person you'd expect to see on 
the glossy pages of "Vanity Fair." But there he was last month, peeking out 
among the perfume ads and gossip, under the headline, "Hot Paints." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the art world has become hopelessly star-struck, perhaps the magazine 
was a good place for local artist Raul Guerrero to be seen. His Los Angeles 
dealer thinks so. Guerrero, mildly allergic to marketing strategies and hype, 
just smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a working-class artist," he said in a recent interview at his San Diego 
home and studio. "I'm in a situation where I need to make a living off my art, 
to continue my artistic quest." 
</P>
<P>
That quest, begun in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, where he attended the 
legendary Chouinard Art School, has gradually but steadily assumed the 
characteristics of a successful career. Guerrero's third one-person show at Los 
Angeles' Saxon-Lee Gallery opened last month and continues through Nov. 25. He 
is one of 13 artists -- and the only one living outside the L.A. area -- 
featured in the inaugural exhibit at Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts 
(through Jan. 31). 
</P>
<P>
The current issue of the art quarterly, "Visions" carries a statement by 
Guerrero in its special section on multiculturalism and the arts. And next 
year, a fountain designed by the artist will be unveiled as part of the Hope 
Street redevelopment project commissioned by the city of Los Angeles. Other 
participants include architect Frank Gehry and artist David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's work is, indeed, "caliente," as Karen Smith exclaims in "Vanity 
Fair." But the artist, 44, is no overnight sensation. He has had nearly 20 solo 
exhibitions in San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere since his first show in 
</P>
<P>
1974 and a healthy dose of attention from the press as well. One critic 
dismissed the inverted pyramid, flying saucer hubcaps, rotating Indian mask and 
other symbolic constructions in his first show as "irritatingly hip." Others 
since have labeled his photographs, paintings and constructions mysterious, 
disturbing, vital, intriguing, timeless, gentle, ironic and haunting. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the extreme permutations in style that his work has shown, varying from 
severe conceptualism to lyrical romanticism, Guerrero said he has been 
following the same line of thought for the last 15 years. He's searching, he 
said, for a poetic reality that exists between an object or situation and the 
person perceiving it. 
</P>
<P>
"To illustrate reality is, in itself, not significant enough to achieve a level 
of poetics," he said. "There's a moment when you enter that realm, a transitory 
zone between fiction, what you imagine and what you perceive, based on your 
entire contextual history, your background, education, what conditions you to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's interest in reconciling reality and fiction surfaces in perhaps its 
most accessible form in his paintings of the last few years. The suite, 
"Reflections on the Life and Times of a Venetian Jewess," conveys Guerrero's 
impressions of the textures, light and color of the Italian city as much as it 
restates certain cliches about the place, stemming from "what Hollywood fed me, 
what I read in books." The melange of expectations he brings to a place, he 
said, are as tangible as the direct sensations experienced there. 
</P>
<P>
The Venetian series launched a trilogy, whose second part is the current 
series, "Aspectos de la Vida Nocturna en Tijuana B.C. (Aspects of the Night 
Life in Tijuana B.C.)." Each of these environments required a different 
attitude, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I set out to do places that were exotic, romantic, that offered the 
possibility of color, places that were a celebration of life, places that I had 
an affinity for." 
</P>
<P>
Venice, he said, is "part of our collective knowledge as one of the grand 
cities of the world," while the bars and clubs of Tijuana summon more personal 
memories. Painting this series "was part of re-experiencing what I had done as 
a teen-ager, as a rite of passage, to go down to the Blue Fox." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero still sees work ahead for the Tijuana series, which was shown locally 
at the David Zapf Gallery and is now on view at Saxon-Lee in Los Angeles, but 
his third destination is already set: Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of my cultural heritage, since I was brought up in the U.S. It 
affected my psyche, because many of the dreams lived out in Southern California 
originated in the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
Though he has never been there, he expects his visit will be like "going back 
and delving into the historical side of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the locales Guerrero chooses poses a different structural problem, he 
said, and each calls for a different solution. An earlier series based on a 
stay in Mexico related to the "magic realism" of such Latin American authors as 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez in its combination of the imaginary and the concrete. 
The current trilogy draws comparisons in style to the loose, buoyant brush 
strokes of Matisse and the color-saturated romanticism of Delacroix. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamental to all of his work, however, is a curiosity about symbols, myths 
and the cultural archetypes that strike deep in the viewer's unconscious. His 
passionate pursuit of these essential symbols led artist Ed Ruscha, who 
collects Guerrero's work, to believe that "he has some demons haunting him and 
he lets them out in his work." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero chuckled at the thought, then quickly sifted the comment for insights. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never thought about it like that, and I think he's right. But I think he 
missed the angels hovering around me. I think what he meant was that I'm 
obsessed by it. I'm totally captivated by the creative act, the creative 
pursuit. I think about it all the time."

RELIGIOUS EDUCATORS' GROUP URGES EL SALVADOR AID CUTOFF

<P>
In a rare political declaration, the American Academy of Religion meeting 
Monday night adopted a resolution urging the suspension of U.S. military aid to 
El Salvador while last week's murder of six Jesuit priests is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The academy of collegiate and seminary professors, which will end its annual 
meeting at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers today, was asked to adopt the 
statement by the chairmen of theology and religious studies departments at 
Jesuit universities and by more than 100 others who signed a similar petition. 
</P>
<P>
The joint conference with the Society of Biblical Literature is usually limited 
to reading and discussing hundreds of academic papers. About 5,000 people 
attended this year's four-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Academy President Robert L. Wilken of the University of Virginia said it was 
"very unusual" for the academy of nearly 6,000 U.S. and Canadian scholars to 
take a political stance. Board members, in fact, tabled a similar motion 
Friday, citing the membership's diverse views. 
</P>
<P>
But the business meeting of the academy adopted -- with minimal opposition 
among the 40 members attending -- a statement that U.S. arms shipments be 
suspended while "the brutal murders" of six fellow religious educators at the 
University of Central America and two co-workers are investigated. The 
resolution also lamented what sponsors said were 60,000 people who have died or 
disappeared during El Salvador's turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The Society of Biblical Literature's business meeting Sunday also adopted a 
resolution decrying last week's murders, but the statement did not call for a 
response by the U.S. government.

Troops who captured a man with 225 pounds of dynamite in a raid in Bogota 
widened their search Monday for members of a terrorist ring apparently hired by 
cocaine traffickers, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers arrested Luis Antonio Guzman in a raid Sunday and found 108 sticks of 
dynamite and a two-way radio. Authorities and news reports have linked Guzman 
to a 25-pound car bomb defused Friday afternoon in front of an upscale 
supermarket in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Ramon Eduardo Niebles said Monday that Guzman was part of a 
terrorist band planning a string of attacks in the capital.

HOMELESS DINE IN PROTEST OF PLAN TO CURB SOUP KITCHENS

<P>
About 150 homeless people gathered outside City Hall on Monday night for an 
early Thanksgiving dinner and to protest a city proposal that would place 
restrictions on soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Committee to Feed the Homeless, a group made up of five 
organizations, served a turkey dinner and handed out hundreds of blankets to 
people who began lining up at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was intended to protest a proposal to require mobile soup kitchens 
to set up portable toilets, tables and trash cans at each stop, according to 
Jonathan Parfrey, a member of Catholic Worker, a Santa Ana group that serves 
hot meals every Monday from a van. 
</P>
<P>
People began arriving outside City Hall at about 5:45 p.m., pushing shopping 
carts or carrying plastic bags with their belongings. As volunteers began 
serving 16 turkeys, 150 pounds of mashed potatoes, 10 gallons of gravy and 
peas, the guests returned with their plates to nearby benches, or sat on the 
concrete, or simply stood and ate. Some carried candles given to them by the 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, who didn't want to give his last name, said he has been homeless for five 
months. After receiving his plate, Tom observed: "I know the city has been 
harassing a lot of us, so it means so much just to sit here and eat dinner, 
right outside the chambers." 
</P>
<P>
Another guest, Pat Ford, who sleeps at night in the Civic Center area, said: 
"It's not so much for the food that we're here. It's to say to the City 
Council, please help us." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Ron May, Miguel A. Pulido and Richards L. Norton helped to 
distribute hygiene kits and blankets to the homeless, some of whom jeered them. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather, a member of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, 
described the dinner as a grass-roots protest against the plan to place 
restrictions on soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the homeless are not voiceless," he said. "They are saying to 
the council, 'Stop this proposal before it gets too far.' " 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group called Cleanup Our Businesses and Residential Areas helped 
draft that proposal and filed it with the city's Planning Department. It is 
undergoing legal screening, city officials said, before going to the Planning 
Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Groups that help the homeless in Santa Ana say the proposal would be too costly 
and eventually would force them to stop serving food. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana is trying to limit the serving of any kind of food to the homeless," 
Parfrey said. "We are willing to work with the city, but they are not willing 
to work with us." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream said the city does not have a policy on the homeless 
and has been working with the organizations. Ream declined to comment on the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has about 10,000 homeless people, 1,500 of whom stay in Santa 
Ana, it is estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The city has had a shaky relationship with its homeless populace for years, 
advocates for the homeless said. In 1988, the city confiscated belongings of 
the homeless, such as bedding and clothes stashed around the Civic Center. The 
city stopped its actions after a protest was filed and allowed homeless people 
to pick up their belongings at Centennial Regional Park.

CENTRAL AMERICA: RELIGIOUS ORDER IN ORANGE LETS ELENA JARAMILLO 'CALL THE

<P>
It was a performance to be expected from Sister Elena Jaramillo, the Sisters of 
St. Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-tall, gray-haired nun, struggling to recover from a case of 
hepatitis, summoned the strength to defy Salvadoran soldiers who last weekend 
rousted a tiny church and terrorized the families that had taken refuge there. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns would not leave the church, Jaramillo told the soldiers, until the 
last refugee was safely released. And despite living in a war zone, ministering 
in a village where there is no running water and no electricity, Jaramillo, 53, 
refuses to leave El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we are all anxious about her safety . . . but we have agreed to let 
her call the shots," said Sister Katherine Gray, assistant general superior of 
the Orange-based order that has counted Jaramillo a member for 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew what she was getting into," Gray said, "and she knew there was reason 
to be afraid. But she is really committed to the people there." 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo is the only nun from the 283-member order who is working in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"She is wiry, really alive," Sister Sharon Fritsch, a counselor in the order, 
said of Jaramillo. "She is such a people person. She can just make people feel 
really energetic in her presence." 
</P>
<P>
Fritsch said Jaramillo's love affair with the people of El Salvador began in 
1986 when she first visited the country to help escort residents from San 
Salvador, the capital, to their rural hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
"She saw the reality of the danger," Fritsch said. "I went down to visit her 
last year and experienced something of the same reality. But once you are in 
contact with these people, there is a goodness, a steadfastness, a communion 
you experience with them that is stronger than the fear." 
</P>
<P>
Through a Christian volunteer organization called Salvadoran Human Aid, 
Research and Education, Jaramillo moved in October, 1987, to a village that is 
a four-hour bus trip from San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the nuns of the Sisters of St. Joseph were reluctant to provide a 
photograph of Jaramillo or even name the village where she works for fear of 
retribution by soldiers. Church leaders are increasingly the targets of 
assassinations in El Salvador, as evidenced by last week's slaying of six 
Jesuit priests at a university in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been careful about what we would say to call attention to her," Gray 
said. "We know that what appears in the papers here gets back to El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the nuns heard about Jaramillo's harrowing weekend through a news 
report and were surprised that she had provided her name and religious order. 
"That she was willing to take a stand like that says something about the 
extremity of the situation," Fritsch said. "She isn't somebody to walk 
foolishly into a dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
Fritsch last spoke with Jaramillo on Wednesday, she said, when Jaramillo was 
fine. The Sisters of St. Joseph wanted to send medicine for Jaramillo's 
hepatitis, but she discouraged them from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
"She said: 'Please do not do anything. I don't want anything extraordinary 
being done,' " Fritsch said, adding that Jaramillo's hepatitis is not 
considered life-threatening at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo last visited the United States in July, when she spent a month with 
the Sisters of St. Joseph. During that time, she spoke of the struggle of the 
Salvadoran people and her need to stand in solidarity with them, Fritsch said. 
</P>
<P>
The area where Jaramillo lives was devastated by war in 1980, when the parish 
priest was driven out by fighting, Fritsch said. The battles destroyed or 
damaged many buildings, including the church. Jaramillo and another nun share 
one room as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the villagers, the nuns cope with food shortages and the lack 
of utilities. Among the activities coordinated by the nuns are classes for 
children and sessions in which villagers learn about farming. 
</P>
<P>
"They lead a very austere life," Fritsch said. "But she expressed a real joy, a 
real desire to return."

NIXON'S BIRTHPLACE MAY GO ON NEW FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will vote tonight on whether to adopt a new city flag 
picturing the birthplace of former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Arthur C. Simonian will present a report recommending that the new 
flag feature the city seal, which includes the house of Nixon's birth and a 
background of stars and stripes. 
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that the city retain the existing flag. 
</P>
<P>
"The new flag will represent the positive developments associated with the 
Nixon Birthplace and Library," the report said. "The old flag serves the 
purpose of preserving the historical integrity of the community." 
</P>
<P>
The old flag is a solid orange banner with a small panorama set inside a circle 
at the flag's center. The panorama shows a man, a horse and a bird, with rays 
of sun coming over hills in the background. Above the circle in white letters 
is the city's name; curved below is its motto, "Land of Gracious Living." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Henry W. Wedaa suggested the flag change at the council's Oct. 17 
meeting.

CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON BLOCK GRANT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking to upgrade housing in low- to moderate-income areas throughout Brea, 
the City Council will decide tonight whether to apply for its 16th year of 
membership in the countywide Community Development Block Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, established in 1974 by Congress to provide grants to cities for 
community development projects, aids many Orange County cities in improving 
residences and updating buildings that no longer meet building code 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is recommending that the council approve the city's application 
for funds to rehabilitate 35 residences. 
</P>
<P>
As a participant in the program for 15 years, Brea has processed almost 170 
housing rehabilitation loans and completed several public works projects with 
the funding. The city has allotted three-fourths of the grant money for housing 
in central Brea, and most of the rehabilitation funds have been used to correct 
serious health, safety and code enforcement problems, city staff members have 
said.

CITY BANS HOURLY MOTEL-ROOM RENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to battle male and female prostitutes in the city, the City Council 
Monday night approved a ban on the hourly rental of motel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 0 for the ordinance, which also requires motel operators 
to keep an accurate, permanent register of all customers. It takes effect in 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this is to cut down on prostitution, and that's what we want to 
do," said Councilman J. Tilman Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's action makes permanent an emergency ordinance first enacted on May 15 
at the urging of Police Chief John L. Robertson. He argued that some areas of 
the city, particularly Garden Grove Boulevard between Magnolia Street and Beach 
Boulevard, have a proliferation of prostitutes, adult bookstores, peep shows 
and inexpensive motels. 
</P>
<P>
As part of city efforts to clean up Garden Grove Boulevard, the City Council 
denied operating permits to four peep shows on that street. Court action is now 
pending against those firms.

TENNIS CLUB, CONDO PROJECT ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of a 10-acre tennis club and 53 adjacent condominiums are asking for 
approval of their project at tonight's City Council meeting, despite a 
recommendation from the Planning Commission that the development be denied. 
</P>
<P>
The project by developer Cecil R. Bunnell has been in the works since 1986, 
when he submitted plans for a tennis club and self-storage units at a site near 
the corner of Camino Capistrano and Oso Road. That plan drew criticism from 
city officials and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan for 53 condominiums to replace the storage units was harshly 
criticized by the Planning Commission last month in a unanimous vote against 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an awful project," said acting Planning Commission Chairwoman Carolyn 
Nash. "We wouldn't allow it to be built anywhere in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the proposal for 53 condominiums includes a plan to build 25 homes on 
six acres near Trabuco Creek that is designated as permanent open space. She 
also said that if the project were built as proposed, it would violate the city 
General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council meeting begins at 7 p.m. in City Hall, 32400 Paseo Adelanto. WENDY

OCTD RIDERSHIP UP 17.4% LAST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a nickel increase in fares, ridership jumped 17.4% on Orange County 
Transit District buses in the last quarter, setting a record. 
</P>
<P>
Boardings totaled more than 11 million for the quarter, General Manager James 
P. Reichert told the district's board of directors meeting Monday in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose more than 15%, Reichert said. The nickel increase took effect July 
1, raising the fare to 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The ridership gains followed a record year in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tremendous ridership growth shows in part that the community is responding 
to the air-quality problem by choosing to share a ride rather than only using 
their personal automobile," Reichert said. "It's especially important to note 
that over two-thirds of our passengers are taking the bus to work, so Orange 
County's tax dollars are being used productively." 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of OCTD costs were covered by fares. Like all public bus systems, 
OCTD is subsidized by taxpayers.

COUNCIL TO SELECT NAME FOR NEW PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORELEI LACHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cypress City Council tonight will open secret entries and choose a name for 
a new park -- which, according to the rules, must include both a person's name 
and that of a Mediterranean tree. 
</P>
<P>
The contest sponsored by the city drew seven entries. To qualify, the entries 
must both honor a person and reflect the Mediterranean architecture of the 
area, such as Smith Palm Park. 
</P>
<P>
Other parks in Orange County have been named through contests. In fact, Yorba 
Linda just concluded a contest naming a park after the late Jean Woodard, a 
longtime community volunteer. That city still has five parks to name and is 
accepting ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But usually, parks are named after former mayors, people who donated the land 
for the park or heroes. For example, a park is named after Chris Carr, a war 
hero and longtime resident of Huntington Beach. Another Huntington Beach park 
is named after Leslie Prince, the first police officer in Huntington Beach to 
be killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Fullerton honored the three Apollo astronauts who died in a launching 
pad tragedy at Cape Canaveral. The city named one park for Virgil (Gus) 
Grissom, one for Richard Chaffee and a third for Edward White. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities leave the naming process up to the City Council, resulting in parks 
being named for former mayors. In fact, in Huntington Beach, names of deceased 
mayors have priority, and the name of a deceased mayor born longest ago has top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the public is asked for help with more than just a name. In 1977, 
Santa Ana held a contest for a park symbol. The city received more than 350 
entries. The winner was Georgianna Russell, a clerk with an environmental 
agency. Russell had submitted a caricature of a woodpecker which read, "Welcome 
Woody." LORELEI LACHMAN

LIGHT OF FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanksgiving has a special place in the hearts of all Americans when we 
recognize the many blessings that we have in this nation. 
</P>
<P>
But this Thanksgiving is different and more meaningful as we watch so many 
people in Eastern Europe and parts of the Soviet Union who, for the first time 
in their lives, are seeing the light of freedom. To observe the joy on their 
faces is truly a great moment in world history and reminds us of the struggle 
that we had as a young nation to obtain liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this struggle came the U.S. Constitution. We are fortunate to celebrate 
its bicentennial, with emphasis, which started this fall, on the Bill of 
Rights. This Thanksgiving should be glorious, indeed.

COUNTY'S DRAG-RACE DEATH TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood's romanticized view of a young, macho drag racer crossing the finish 
line and winning the respect of his peers or his girlfriend has little meaning 
for the families and friends of at least 10 people who have been killed in such 
county races since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics kept by law enforcement agencies do not separate drag racing from 
other accidents involving excessive speed, so there may have been more county 
victims than the 10 identified from news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers were not always the ones who died. For example, Cori Wang was 
killed instantly when an Acura in which she was riding spun out of control and 
slammed into a light pole April 11 on a winding, dipping stretch of Placentia 
Avenue near Estancia High School in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Pei Wang, who was driving, suffered head and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Acura was given to Pei Wang by her father, who said at the time of the 
accident: "She would never race or speed. She was such a good girl. People 
should not assume they were speeding just because they are teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Mesa police told a different story. Investigator Floyd Waldron said 
there was evidence that Pei was drag racing with another car driven by her 
16-year-old boyfriend. Waldron said skid marks indicated that the Acura was 
traveling 60 to 65 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's kind of exciting," California Highway Patrol officer Wayne Fox 
said of teen-age fascination with drag racing. "They get a car they think is 
(great), and they want to test it out." 
</P>
<P>
By far, most of those caught racing are teen-agers and people in their early 
20s, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Robert Rivas said: "I don't care how well you train 
your kids . . . when they feel the power of the engine, they're going to want 
to test it. We can educate and educate and educate, but there's still that 
curiousity there." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently it was there Aug. 23, when a car that witnesses said was drag racing 
crashed into a tree in the center divider on Lampson Avenue in Seal Beach and 
burned, killing its driver, a 19-year-old Seal Beach man. 
</P>
<P>
Other examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 1, 1988 -- A 17-year-old youth lost control of his Ford Mustang during a 
drag race in La Habra. The car was sheered in half when it hit a utility pole. 
Driver Andrew Meza of Rowland Heights, was thrown out; he died later at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 30, 1985 -- Gregory Goodspeed, 26 of Westminster, decided to drag-race 
his motorcycle in competition with a friend, police said. As Knott Street 
curved eastward, Goodspeed lost control of his Yamaha, hit a curb, then struck 
a parked car. He was wearing a helmet but died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 21, 1984 -- A UCLA student, Ha Quoc Vu, 25, was killed while adding oil 
to his disabled Volkswagen on a shoulder of the San Diego Freeway. The CHP said 
a car swerved onto the shoulder at about 80 m.p.h. and fatally struck the 
student and injured his companion, who barely dived out of the way. Witnesses 
said that Jerry James York, 23, of Huntington Beach was racing his Chevrolet El 
Camino against his roommate's Chevrolet Caprice. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 2, 1983 -- Randy Craft and Jeffrey Thomas were racing at least 80 m.p.h. 
on Adams Street near Newland Street in Huntington Beach, police said, when both 
cars, seconds apart, struck an auto driven by Gloria Chang as she was turning 
onto Newland. Chang's car was hurled about 375 feet, and she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
On March 6, 1985, they pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter and were 
sentenced to 60 days in jail and three years' probation. Chang was a mother of 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Rivas said the inclination to drag-race weakens as people mature: 
"It seems like everyone goes through a phase (with driving fast). Let's just 
hope for most people it's a short phase."

DECAPITATED CAT FOUND AT SCHOOL

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mutilated cat was found dead, its head and paws severed, in front of an 
Irvine elementary school Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the decapitated animal and body parts strewn about the 
grounds of Greentree Elementary School. Police Sgt. Jeff Kermode said officers 
were sent to the campus after a 2:40 p.m. call from the school's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that a decapitated cat head was placed on a sprinkler head at the 
school," Kermode said. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Tustin, residents have become alarmed by at least 67 cat killings 
since last winter. 
</P>
<P>
In Tustin, county and federal officials believe that the cats have been killed 
by coyotes. But members of TRAK -- Tustin Residents Against Animal Killers -- 
insist that the pets were taken deliberately by humans, possibly by Satan 
worshipers for ritual sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
David Eick, 22, a bus driver for a day-care center near Greentree Elementary, 
said the animal was discovered in the afternoon by students leaving the school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to pick up some students in my bus, I found them all staring at 
the remains of the cat," Eick said. He said one second-grader told him that he 
was afraid because he believed that the dead cat, which was black and white, 
was similar to his family's pet cat.

RAMS BACK TO NFC WEST TITLE CHASE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER EASY VICTORY OVER PHOENIX, ROBINSON IS TALKING ABOUT 
CATCHING SAN FRANCISCO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams threw a welcome back party for themselves Monday after returning from 
a four-game losing streak to the thick of the race in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Coach John Robinson was outlining his team's chances in 
complicated terms of wild-card playoff spots, all but conceding the division to 
San Francisco. He wasn't exactly limb-stepping then, considering the 49ers were 
cruising along at a Super Bowl clip while Robinson's Rams were praying they'd 
never see another Hail Mary pass thrown their way again. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing the 49ers by two games with five left and the Rams are in the thick of 
the race? OK, maybe it's a thinner race than that, but it certainly beats their 
view from the Minnesota locker room a few weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams already have beaten the 49ers once. Of their remaining five games, 
classify two as tossups: this week's battle in New Orleans and the Dec. 11 
rematch with the 49ers at Anaheim Stadium. If you don't think you can win the 
other three -- Dallas, New York Jets and New England -- kindly remove your team 
from the playoffs and this discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have four tough games remaining: the New York Giants, Rams, Chicago 
and Buffalo. Throw in one freebie, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are in reasonable shape if they can stay at least two games behind the 
leaders until their December rematch. If the Rams beat San Francisco again and 
sweep the season series, they'd win any first-place ties with the 49ers, who 
close out the season against Chicago and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams finish with the Jets and Patriots. Naturally, coaches never look 
beyond next week's game, but Robinson's outlook has changed from the days of 
defeat and dirges. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be realistic," Robinson said. "To win the division, we've got to 
win the rest of the games. Maybe you could get away with losing one. But I 
think we have to beat San Fransico to win the division. I could see us 
conceivably tying them. Then, if we beat them twice, we would be the 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves here? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be led into these things about prophesying the future," 
Robinson said. "I just want to try and beat New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
And that is an imposing task in itself. Not only do are Saints just a game 
behind the Rams at 6-5, they've already beaten the Rams once, meaning a slip-up 
in New Orleans could wipe the Rams off the playoff map altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The roads are diverse and unsettled, division champs or home for the holidays. 
What's it going to be? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing realistic for us is just not worry about it," Robinson said. 
"And I'm like everyone else. I go home at night and I make out all these 
charts, and then I lose them and can't find them the next morning, so I have to 
make out a new chart." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gray's great day against Phoenix -- two interceptions, eight tackles, 
four passes defended -- has convinced Robinson to switch the cornerback to his 
natural position, free safety, next season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has talked about it before, but this time he's serious. Gray has made 
three consecutive Pro Bowls at left cornerback, but the Rams think they're only 
scratching the surface with his open-field talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I should take Jerry Gray and say, 'you're a safety, even if I've got to hire 
you on the right corner and me on the left corner,' " Robinson said. "Last year 
we kind of wanted to do it and chickened out." 
</P>
<P>
With LeRoy Irvin's skills slipping with age, Robinson was afraid to make the 
move this year and be left with two inexperienced corners, Cliff Hicks and 
rookie Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
But Hicks has recovered from a rocky start to challenge Irvin for the starting 
position, and it might already be Hick's. Irvin hasn't started the last two 
games because of a foot injury, and getting his job now will take some work. 
Gray was an All-American safety at the University of Texas, and has always 
prefered the safety over cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Gray plays free safety in the Rams' pass-defense package, but next year the 
switch will be complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jerry (age 26) could play well into his 30s at that position and be 
very successful," Robinson said. "And I think he will be an All-Pro at that 
position. . . . I think Jerry's a '9' as a safety. At corner, he's not a '9'." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson said Doug Reed's left ankle sprain would probably put him out for 
two weeks, although Reed was more optimistic on Monday. "I think I could 
probably come back pretty quick," he said. . . . Cleveland Gary got six carries 
in the Rams' victory over Phoenix on Sunday, but Robinson said it's not his 
fault. "We didn't get the ball early, and I was getting (upset)," Robinson 
said. "We got it and we scored. I know Cleveland Gary is a player. I thought he 
was before, now I know." . . . Henry Ellard now has 5,537 career receiving 
yards, good for third place on the team's all-time list. He's five catches shy 
of moving ahead of Jack Snow into third place on the all-time reception list 
behind Tom Fears and Elroy Hirsch. "Until I'm No. 1, I can't think too much of 
it," Ellard said of his accomplishments.

HENRY ELLARD 
</P>
<P>
He might have had some better days in his seven-year pro career, but he has 
never had more fun than Sunday. He caught five passes from Jim Everett, but it 
was what he did with them that had Rams fans on their feet. He got two Cardinal 
defenders turned around in the first quarter, took a short pass from Everett 
and streaked 49 yards for a touchdown. His response to a 42-yard fourth-quarter 
TD play was an end-zone forward somersault. The 163 yards he accounted for 
enabled him to move into third place on the Rams' all-time reception yardage 
list with 5,537.

UC IRVINE'S STIRLING AND RABBITT GAIN NCAA ALL-AMERICAN HONORS

<P>
Brigid Stirling and Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine earned All-American honors 
Monday at the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's cross-country 
championships Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, a senior, finished the 5,000-meter course in 17 minutes 16.5 seconds 
for 24th place. Rabbitt, a junior who also earned All-American honors as a 
freshman in 1987, ran 17:22.52. She finished 29th. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine women, who entered the meet ranked 12th in the nation, finished 10th 
overall. Rounding out Irvine's top five were freshman Rayna Cervantes, 75th in 
17:59.32, junior Amy Dabul (118th in 18:23.35) and freshman Laurie Lucas (129th 
in 18:31.28). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very happy," Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle said. "We've been bouncing 
between seventh and 10th all year long in the rankings. . . . It's a super 
effort, a great effort. And having two All-Americans in one year from one 
program, I'm awfully happy with that. This is a young team -- Brigid is the 
only senior -- so the future looks outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Huber, a 1988 Olympian in the 3,000 meters, won the women's race in 
15:59.86 -- the fastest time in nine years of women's NCAA competition -- to 
lead Villanova to the team title with 99 points. Kentucky was second with 168 
and Nebraska third with 186. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, John Nuttall and Jonah Koech of Iowa State finished 
1-2 to lead the Cyclones to the men's title with 54 points. Oregon was second 
with 72.

TERRENCE MAHON FINALLY STEPS OUT FROM BEHIND BIG SHADOWS AT OREGON; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: HERALDED LA HABRA RUNNER BOOSTS THE DUCKS BY GAINING 
ALL-AMERICAN HONORS AT THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Open the media guide of the University of Oregon's cross-country team, glance 
through the pages and witness the strong and storied tradition that unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Salazar . . . Rudy Chapa . . . Steve Prefontaine. The names loom from 
its record lists. Four national championships are among the highlights of its 
history; Bill Dellinger, its coach, is one of the nation's most well-respected. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, along with the guide's look at the past, there is a look at the 
present. Namely the members of the current Oregon squad, with brief biographies 
on each. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a glaring omission. His name is Terrence Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon, from La Habra High School, walked on at Oregon last year as a freshman. 
Because his chances of making the team were so poor, he decided to redshirt. 
Although he competed in several meets unattached, his performances were 
anything but extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
He was rarely noticed. Neither Dellinger nor the Oregon runners thought he 
would amount to much. So when it came time for the 1989 media guide to be 
printed last summer, Mahon wasn't included in the team biographies; he wasn't 
among those projected as a possible team member. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon, The Times' Orange County runner of the year in 1987, has in one year 
become a great boost for Oregon. Monday, at the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. cross-country championships at Annapolis, Md., Mahon placed 18th overall 
-- earning him All-American honors -- to help the Ducks to a second-place 
finish. Top-ranked Iowa was first. 
</P>
<P>
For Mahon, running for Oregon has been a dream come true. In high school, 
Mahon's team was good but certainly not great. Because of this, he often 
trained on his own and raced as an individual. All the way around, it's been a 
tremendous turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been the surprise of the year for us," Dellinger said. "If you were to 
ask me at the end of last year, I would have probably said there was no way he 
would make the team. I can't think of anyone who has surprised us at Oregon as 
much as Terrence has." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise No. 1 came at the team's training camp last summer. Mahon said the 
camp, at Odell Lake in central Oregon, gave him an opportunity to prove 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Mahon kept up with the top team members through most of the workouts. On the 
final day, the team was to run a 10-miler. Mahon stuck with one of the team's 
better runners, Pat Haller, the entire distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat was someone who was predicted to do really well for us this year, so I 
wanted to show that after running hard all week, I was still strong enough to 
stay with him," Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to run well enough to show them that I should be taken to the 
first meet." 
</P>
<P>
At that first meet, Mahon finished as Oregon's No. 3 man. In the next race, he 
was Oregon's second finisher. At the Pac-10 championships at Stanford, he was 
Oregon's No. 3 man again, but he placed seventh overall, helping the Ducks win 
the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrence is definitely one of the reasons we're a better team this year," 
Dellinger said. 
</P>
<P>
At the NCAA Region 8 championships Nov. 11, Mahon placed fifth as Oregon swept 
the first five spots to win the meet with 15 points -- something no other 
Oregon team had done at the regional meet. In that race, Mahon surged in the 
final quarter mile past Stanford's Eric Mastalir, one of the nation's finest 
high school runners and a California state two-mile champion while at 
Carmichael Jesuit in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Mastalir, Mahon has outrun many of the top stars that he had met -- 
and could not beat -- in high school. They include: UCLA's David Scudamore, a 
two-time Southern Section cross-country champion from Palos Verdes; Arizona's 
Brian Grosso, the 1988 national cross-country champion, and UC Irvine's Aaron 
Mascorro, the 1987 state two-mile runner-up at Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Mascorro, who outkicked Mahon through two years of Southern Section competition 
-- "in every meet we were in together," Mahon said -- finished 21 spots behind 
Mahon at the Region 8 meet. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he thinks he's improved so dramatically, Mahon just shrugs. "I 
don't know," he said. "I put forth a lot of effort. It's just steady progress. 
. . . Oh, and I've lost 20 pounds (since high school)." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, being slim and trim is important for any distance runner -- Mahon is 
5-feet-9 and 128 pounds and said, "If I'm 127, I can't do a thing," -- but 
weight is not, in itself, a significant reason for success. 
</P>
<P>
Of certain significance, for Mahon anyway, is the fact that Oregon offers a 
runner-happy environment. Eugene, popularly known as Track City, U.S.A., is 
famous for its soft, scenic wood-chip running trails -- "Bark dust trails," 
Mahon said -- that are near inspirational for distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the local population includes many world-class athletes, such as longtime 
resident Mary Decker Slaney and Salazar. Salazar, trying to make a comeback 
after several years of injury and illness, regularly trains with the Oregon 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, rubbing elbows with running's elite doesn't mean the elite ability 
will rub off. But for Mahon, hard work has definitely made a difference. Since 
he arrived at Oregon last year, Mahon intensified his training program, 
increasing his mileage from about 50-60 miles a week as a high-schooler to 
around 100. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the higher mileage) helps me mentally," he said. "In a race, I wouldn't 
want a guy who puts in only 50 miles a week to pass me." 
</P>
<P>
And Mahon, a strength runner who sometimes suffered from a lack of speed, has 
improved in that area as well. In high school, Mahon never ran the two mile 
faster than 9 minutes 10 seconds, but Dellinger said last week Mahon ran a 9:03 
two mile in practice "as if he were jogging." 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that helped is I worked out with (Oregon's top two runners) 
Brad Hudson and Pete Fonseca this summer," Mahon said. "Brad trains like an 
animal. We do most of our running at six-minute (per mile) pace. Now, running 
6:30 pace feels too slow. I'm hammering myself, but not every day. I'm not 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger agreed: "He uses good common sense. That's hard for a young runner, 
sometimes. There's quite a jump between being a good runner in high school and 
a good runner in college. 
</P>
<P>
"What impresses me most about him is the consistency he shows. We have guys who 
work their fannies off to make the team, much like Terrence did. They're in 
great shape at first, but then later, they fall apart. He didn't do that. He 
made an immediate impression with the first race, then got better each week. 
He's for real. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to show you how important desire really is. A lot of people have 
talent but don't do anything with it. His is to a point where his desire has 
taken him to where he is today."

Last season, UC Irvine women's basketball Coach Dean Andrea had his guards up. 
</P>
<P>
Without a healthy center, with all but one of its regular players under 6-feet 
tall, with an inexperienced team in one of the best conferences, the Anteaters 
attacked with their guards. They gambled with full-court presses and 
three-point shots. 
</P>

"It was really a lot of fun, but we just got our heads beaten in," Andrea said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters finished 4-14 and in a three-way tie for seventh place in the 
10-team Big West Conference. They were 9-20 overall, which was Andrea's worst 
record since 1978 -- his first as Irvine coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West coaches predicted last week that the Anteaters will finish eighth 
in the conference this season, but Andrea said he thinks the humbling 
experience of last season has made them better than that. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha Parks, last year's only senior who had a 14.6 points per game average 
at forward, has graduated. But three starting guards -- Shurrell Johnson, Jenny 
Lee and Kathy Lizarraga -- return, and the bench is improved. 
</P>
<P>
Long-range gunners Lizarraga and Lee made 90 of Irvine's conference-leading 92 
three-point shots. Irvine attempted 57 more three-point shots than its nearest 
conference rival and led the conference in three-point percentage. Lizarraga, 
now a sophomore, took and made more three-pointers than any other Big West 
player. 
</P>
<P>
To Andrea, those three-point shots represented desperate attempts to stay in 
games against taller, more-talented opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, now a junior, and Lizarraga got experience largely because Andrea didn't 
have replacements. Even when they made mistakes, Andrea said, he couldn't 
afford to pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, this year's only senior, is a defensive specialist and three-year 
starter who will be looked to for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Geanine Hobbs, a 6-1 sophomore who finished last season at center -- a position 
Andrea said she won by default -- will start at forward. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Hobbs won't have to play center again gives Andrea hope. Junior 
Shannon Unfred, who played sporadically last season because of back and neck 
injuries, is the starting center. Behind her are two 6-4 freshmen recruits, Kim 
Cox, from Livermore, Calif., and Cherie Birtwistle, from Victoria, British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea said he plans to play them all -- sort of a "post position by committee" 
-- because none is a complete center yet. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Anteaters gave Andrea a preview of what he can expect this season 
in a 64-60 victory over the English National Team. He received strong play off 
the bench from freshman Yvonne Catala, a 6-1, all-state forward from College 
Station, Tex. Catala, who averaged 24.4 points as a senior at A&amp;M 
Consolidated High, scored 17 points and had four rebounds in 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine held a 40-26 advantage at halftime but suffered a cold spell in the 
second half, during which the Anteaters scored eight points in about 12 
minutes. Andrea said similar offensive lapses took the Anteaters out of games 
last year.

TITANS SEE RECORDS FALL ON WAY TO RECORDING BEST SEASON SINCE '84

<P>
On the quiet Monday after the end of the season, Gene Murphy sat in his office, 
the names of this year's seniors already erased from the depth chart on the 
wall as preparations for next year begin. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good football team," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
With a one-back offense and one spectacular back, Cal State Fullerton pulled 
out a 6-4-1 record, nailing down their best season since 1984 with a 
well-played victory over San Jose State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the running of Mike Pringle and the accuracy of quarterback Dan Speltz, 
Fullerton set 41 offensive school records this season. 
</P>
<P>
But as the season wound down, it was an improved defense that helped the Titans 
to their best record since Fullerton went 11-1 in 1984, holding the last three 
opponents to 10, 13 and 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the last four games we played as well as a team as we have in a long 
time," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
But the offense was the story of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton switched to a one-back set this season under first-year coordinator 
Bill Wentworth and finished the season with an average gain per play of 6.3 
yards, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
"The (offensive system) is the best we've had since I've been here, with the 
balance between the run and the pass," Murphy said. "And (we) didn't 
necessarily have the best personnel we've had." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, Speltz and receiver Rocky Palamara are leaving Fullerton, but they 
leave their names behind in the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more memorable: 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pringle 
</P>
<P>
 -- 357 yards rushing against New Mexico State, which tied the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. record for a week before Indiana's Anthony Thompson 
broke it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 626 yards rushing in two consecutive games, an NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 2,690 all-purpose yards, second best total in NCAA history to Barry 
Sanders' 3,250. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 11.52 yards a carry against New Mexico State, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 116 points in a season, breaking kicker Greg Steinke's record of 85. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Speltz 
</P>
<P>
 -- 4,595 passing yards in two seasons, a school career record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 156.2 passing efficiency rating, a school season record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- .693 completion percentage, a school season record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 33 touchdown passes in two seasons, a school career record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 481 yards passing against Utah State, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Palamara 
</P>
<P>
 -- 13 receptions against Utah State, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 69 receptions and 1,024 yards, both season records. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 122 receptions for 1,899 yards in two seasons, both school career records. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 18 receiving touchdowns in two seasons, a school career record. 
</P>
<P>
Those records often overshadowed performances by other players, among them nose 
guard John Bavaro, who blocked four kicks; linebacker Russ Oleyer, whose 129 
tackles were a school record, and cornerback Terry Tramble, who had six 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle ran behind an offensive line anchored by Reggie Redding that began the 
season short on experience and finished it short on players who weren't 
injured, but did its job all the same. 
</P>
<P>
And freshman kicker Phil Nevin put on a show of accuracy, hitting 33 of 33 
extra-point attempts and making 15 of 21 field goals. His misses were all 
beyond 48 yards, except for a blocked 36-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was the winning record the Titans said they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Their 5-2 Big West record has assured them a tie for second place. The 6-4-1 
record assures them they won't have to hear again and again how long it has 
been since they had a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
This season, a break in what has been a difficult nonconference schedule 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have had a winning record," Murphy said. "We should have had more 
wins. We should have beat Utah State and we should have beat San Diego State." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will open the 1990 football season with a home game against Sonoma 
State, a Division II school. . . . The basketball season opens at home Friday, 
with the women playing Weber State at 5 p.m. and the men playing Lamar at 7:30. 
. . . Volleyball player Stephanie Scofield is a nominee for the regional GTE 
Academic All-America team.

PICKENS BRINGS ANTI-JAPAN PUSH TO COUNTY

<P>
Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens inaugurated the Orange County chapter of his 
"shareholders rights" organization Monday with a vigorous attack on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, chairman of the Texas energy company Mesa Limited Partnerships and a 
longtime critic of corporate management practices, called for a ban on Japanese 
acquisitions of U.S. companies, even though he conceded that such a move would 
not be in the interest of shareholders in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Japanese firms of operating "cartels" that systematically exclude 
U.S. companies from Japan and artificially prop up Tokyo's domestic financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
He also referred in ominous terms to Japanese "encroachment" with direct 
investments in the United States and said the time had come to "shut it down." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pickens maintained that he favors free trade, he said U.S. 
policy-makers should tell the Japanese: "We're all through doing business with 
you until you let us in" to the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, who has been trying to win a seat on the board of a Japanese firm in 
which he owns a 26% stake, acknowledged that Japanese buyouts are often a good 
deal for U.S. shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
But he also said in his talk at the Four Seasons Hotel that in the long term, 
shareholders would be better off if the United States implemented harsh 
retaliatory trade measures against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The United Shareholders Assn., a lobbying group founded by Pickens in 1986, 
aims to represent the interest of stockholders against what Pickens and others 
regard as the abusive practices of entrenched corporate managers. 
</P>
<P>
The group has fought federal and state legislation aimed at blocking hostile 
takeovers and has attacked corporate anti-takeover measures such as so-called 
"poison pills." 
</P>
<P>
The county chapter of the group, headed by Randy Young of the Santa Ana 
investment banking firm Everhart Corp., is the 35th local chapter and hopes to 
speak on behalf of about 600,000 county shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The group is lobbying for a cut in capital gains taxes and has sought to 
publicize its cause with a "hit list" of 50 U.S. companies the group holds to 
be the worst at protecting shareholder interests. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Corp. of Irvine is among those on the Target 50 list. A Shareholders 
Assn. member is pushing the firm to adopt a secret ballot for the election of 
directors.

ARCHIVE CORP. EARNINGS RISE TO RECORD LEVEL

<P>
Archive Corp. said Monday that its earnings and revenues rose to record levels 
for its 1989 fiscal year, boosted by increased demand for products that back up 
data stored on computers to prevent accidental loss. 
</P>
<P>
The company's net income for the year ended Sept. 29 rose 46% to $15.3 million, 
up from $10.5 million in fiscal 1988; revenue jumped nearly 48% to $181.4 
million, from $122.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, revenue rose 37% to $49.7 million, up from $36.3 
million in the corresponding period in 1988. Earnings grew 31% to $4.2 million, 
up from $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Archive Chairman D. Howard Lewis said the company's financial results reflected 
increasing sales to computer resellers and retailers as well as to computer 
manufacturers. Archive manufactures tape backup devices that are used to make 
copies of computer data stored in hard disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
"While fiscal 1989 brought growth from all segments of our business, our steady 
progress in Europe and the Pacific Rim has been the most gratifying," Lewis 
said. He said international sales made up 27% of the company's sales and rose 
60% over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said earnings were helped by a cost-reduction program put in place during 
1989 that helped cut manufacturing costs.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin-based medical-laser manufacturer said that increased research and 
development and marketing expenses contributed to a 75% decline in net income 
for fiscal 1989. Net income for the year ended Sept. 30 totaled $1.3 million, 
compared to $5.3 million for fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Results for fiscal 1988 included benefits from net operating loss 
carry-forwards totaling $1.2 million. Revenue was $33.3 million, 7% higher than 
the previous year's $31.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, net income dropped 79%, to $328,000 from $1.6 million. 
The fiscal 1988 fourth quarter included an extraordinary gain of $225,000. 
Revenue declined 37%, to $6.6 million from the $10.6 million posted for the 
comparable 1988 period.

QINTEX IN RECEIVERSHIP WITH $1.6-BILLION DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THE AUSTRALIAN FIRM, TRYING TO STAVE OFF A BREAKUP, IS EXPECTED TO 
SELL ITS VERY VALUABLE MONARCH BEACH PROPERTY IN ORANGE COUNTY.

Qintex Australia Ltd., the media and property empire built by entrepreneur 
Christopher Skase, went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off 
complete liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-starved company, which has been in a downward spiral since its 
proposed buyout of the MGM/United Artists movie studio collapsed in October, 
asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group's 
foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company. 
</P>
<P>
The court appointed chartered accountants David Crawford and John Allpass from 
KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 
28 associated companies, stripping Skase of an operational role in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's debts now total $1.6 billion, and the company is expected to sell all 
its resort and property assets -- including a highly priced, 230-acre 
ocean-front parcel in Orange County -- while retaining its television network 
and perhaps its local television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex purchased the 232-acre Monarch Beach property from the Christopher B. 
Hemmetter and the Stein-Brief partnership last July for $132 million and at the 
same time took an option to buy the neighboring 115-acre Dana Headlands 
property for $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
Local real estate experts considered the price extremely high, but Skase said 
he would be able to build a profitable luxury resort on the two properties. He 
expected to spend $1 billion developing the resort. 
</P>
<P>
But Qintex earlier this month forfeited its right to the Headlands property 
when it missed an installment payment, and it now appears that the Monarch 
Beach property will be put on the block. 
</P>
<P>
"What is certain now is that all the resorts will go, and all the land will 
go," said Bryan Madden, director of research at Prudential Bache in Australia. 
Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in 
Hawaii. Princeville announced Monday that the extensive renovation work under 
way at the site had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers, including the right to hire and 
fire, sell Qintex assets and borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Buchanan, a lawyer representing Qintex, told the Supreme Court in 
Victoria state that a receivership was necessary because it would enable Seven 
Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating and thus 
retain their broadcasting licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Madden said the receivership was akin to a Chapter 11 filing in the United 
States. The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation, he said, because a sale of all 
Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half of the outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc., a Beverly Hills firm that is 43% 
owned by Qintex Australia and has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company 
refused to advance needed cash following the aborted MGM/UA deal, said the firm 
now had "little contact" with Qintex Australia and still hoped to emerge from 
Chapter 11.

SHAMU'S MARKETING RIGHTS MAY BE SHARED 
</P>

Anheuser-Busch has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to buy the Sea World parks from 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, but it may have to share the marketing rights to the 
parks' symbol, Shamu the killer whale. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando-based HBJ already has a licensing agreement with Watson General 
Pictures of La Jolla, which created the cartoon "Shamu -- The Beginning," which 
has not yet appeared on television. 
</P>
<P>
Any proceeds from the animated special or merchandising spinoffs will be shared 
among Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, Watson General Pictures and Watson's partner 
in the making of the movie, Lion's Den Venture. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch will also have to share profits, which analysts say could reach 
into the millions of dollars, from the marketing of other Sea World characters 
and animals, according to the licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Vicki Pearlman said the company knew about Watson 
General Pictures when it agreed to purchase the parks from HBJ in September. 
The sale of the Sea World parks is set to close later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was aware of the licensing agreement relating to the Shamu 
character," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One expert said Anheuser-Busch may try to buy the rights back from Watson 
General Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think Anheuser-Busch would want control of the characters," said Bert 
Boksen, who follows theme parks for the Raymond, James &amp; Associates 
regional brokerage in St. Petersburg. "Somebody else . . . could portray Shamu 
in a commercial drinking Miller beer." 
</P>
<P>
HBJ and Sea World officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures' 1988 annual report indicates that the agreement gives 
Sea World royalties of 6% to 50% of proceeds from merchandising, as well as a 
share in proceeds from the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures says in its 1988 annual report that its plans include 
"initiating of a worldwide marketing and merchandising program" to promote the 
photogenic killer whale, as well as television specials, a feature film valued 
at $6 million to $8 million, and a children's TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that Watson has been approached by "a major merchandising 
company" that is interested in marketing the Shamu projects with the company. 
The company was not identified.

SCIENTISTS PURSUE GENETIC FLY SWATTER; 
</P>
<P>
CHROMOSOMES: IF GENES CAN BE MAPPED FOR PEST RESISTANCE, RESEARCHERS MAY TACKLE 
MORE COMPLEX TRAITS. SOME COULD INCREASE CROP YIELDS WITH LESS CHEMICAL 
RELIANCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
After raising millions of insects to feast on corn plants in test fields this 
summer, researchers are surveying the damage for genetic clues to fight the 
$400-million pests. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same techniques that enable law enforcement agencies to identify the 
"genetic fingerprints" of criminals, they are trying to pinpoint pest-resistant 
genes on corn chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is not only to breed corn that resists infestation by the European corn 
borer, but also to use the findings to protect corn and other crops from a wide 
range of pests and diseases, says Michael Lee, an assistant professor of 
agronomy at Iowa State University. 
</P>
<P>
"You end up with an agricultural system less dependent on chemical control of 
insects," Lee says, "a more stable agricultural system." 
</P>
<P>
If scientists can map the location of genes for such traits as pest resistance, 
they can tackle more complex genetic traits, such as those that could increase 
crop yields with less reliance on chemical fertilizers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is working in cooperation with academic and government scientists at the 
Corn Insects Research Unit of the Department of Agriculture at Ankeny, a 
community between Des Moines and Ames, home of Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
He has a $160,000 grant for a four-year genetic study. The USDA contributed 
about $10,000 of its $477,000 budget from the corn research unit this year to 
produce the insects, place them on tens of thousands of plants and record data, 
according to the Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
At laboratories in the midst of corn fields, about 3 million egg masses of 25 
corn borer eggs each were produced this year and kept in Mason jars. The larvae 
were raised in a mixture of ground corn grits and later placed in plastic 
dispensers that released them in batches of 60. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, 240 larvae are placed on a corn plant, but in some cases up to 900 
pests are let loose on one plant. There are six to 10 plants in each of the 
more than 14,000 test plots in Ankeny and Ames. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing escapes infestation," says Bud Guthrie, research leader at the Ankeny 
corn insects research unit. 
</P>
<P>
Adult moths do not damage corn but lay eggs in fields that hatch and can 
decimate crops. 
</P>
<P>
The corn borer causes damage when the first generation of larvae eats corn 
leaves and the second generation eats the protective sheath around the stalk at 
the time of pollination, burrowing into the plant. The damage weakens the 
plants and causes them to topple before harvest. 
</P>
<P>
First found in this country in 1917, the European corn borer was a seemingly 
unbeatable scourge. In the 1930s, entire fields were laid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, estimates that in Iowa fields this past summer, where corn is 
typically sown 25,000 plants to an acre, there was one borer for every other 
plant. That is down from an average of eight a plant 40 years ago, when fields 
were not so thick with corn. 
</P>
<P>
Development of hybrid corn strains and spraying has helped reduce the 
devastation, but it still costs U.S. farmers $400 million a year in losses and 
control efforts, the USDA says. In Iowa, the leading corn producing state, the 
corn borer costs farmers about $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, in test plots near the laboratory, corn with brittle stalks and 
leaves that looked like they'd been raked by shotgun fire stood beside plants 
that would have been at home in any healthy field. 
</P>
<P>
Even the highly susceptible plants look good compared with pictures of the crop 
devastation of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the old times, the entire acreage is resistant," Guthie says.

MOOD SHIFTS TO MORE CABLE-TV REGULATION; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: RISING CONSUMER COMPLAINTS MOVE MANY IN CONGRESS TO LOOK FOR 
WAYS TO IMPROVE COMPETITION.

<P>
Growing viewer dissatisfaction over rates and service in the cable-television 
industry has convinced many members of Congress and the Federal Communications 
Commission that it needs more government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Congress passed a bill that ended regulation of cable rates and left 
the power to grant franchise rights to local governments. Since then, rates 
have jumped by more than 100% in many areas, and the leading companies have 
gained an even greater market share by buying smaller cable concerns. 
</P>
<P>
That has promoted the introduction of several bills in the House and Senate to 
limit cable franchise ownership and encourage greater competition. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the authors of the bills) see a problem -- shoddy service and excessive 
rates," Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) said at the 
opening of hearings on cable-TV problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The huge multiple system operators get bigger, more powerful and exercise even 
more anti-competitive muscle against their competitors," added Sen. Albert Gore 
(D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
"We know we have a problem here. Some cable operators have taken advantage of 
their freedom to set rates," responded National Cable Television Assn. 
President James Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
But Mooney said that rates for basic service had increased only by an average 
of 26% over two years nationwide and that subscribers were getting more 
channels for their money. 
</P>
<P>
"Basic service subscribers now receive an average of 32 channels for 50 cents a 
day. No other industry in America provides such a wide array of information and 
entertainment at such low cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be plenty of room for shop-at-home networks and mud wrestling," 
Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) said in a jab at cable programming. 
</P>
<P>
Cable subscribers represent nearly 55% of all households with television sets. 
Cable industry revenue tops $14 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said concentration in the cable industry has 
increased markedly, with the top four companies controlling about 43% of all 
subscribers in 1989, compared to 28% in 1983. "The volume and intensity of 
complaints does indicate that there are problems that should be addressed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, local cable-television markets are not open to competition. We believe 
those restrictions should be changed," Sikes said. He said he would support 
allowing each franchising authority to license two or more TV program service 
providers rather than the one currently allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"The FCC also plans soon to complete action on its pending inquiry regarding 
possible telephone company provision of video transmission services," Sikes 
added. 
</P>
<P>
He said the FCC would complete an analysis of the industry by July for use by 
Congress in considering whether more legislation was needed. 
</P>
<P>
A bill introduced by Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) and 14 others would limit the 
size of multiple system operators to 15% of cable subscribers. That appeared to 
be aimed at Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable 
operator with about 16% of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"TCI, for one, is obviously hell-bent toward total domination as it buys up not 
only more and more cable systems but major programming services and even movie 
studios," Gore said in a reference to that company's possible purchase of a 50% 
interest in the Showtime channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are not bad guys," replied Tele-Communications President John 
Malone. He said more regulation of cable was not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
The bills have the support of many powerful legislators, but it is not certain 
if any will pass next year. FCC support would improve the chances for some form 
of legislation to increase competition. 
</P>
<P>
There is also concern in Congress that too many sports events are switching 
from free broadcast television to cable networks, raising the possibility that 
fans one day might have to pay to watch the World Series and Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The lure of big bucks may well prompt sports leagues and teams to completely 
bypass free TV, writing off those people who can't afford cable or can't get 
it," Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said at a Judiciary Committee hearing on 
sports television. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Congress has some leverage here, given the favorable antitrust 
treatment granted to sports leagues. We'll use that leverage, if need be." 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum and others said they were concerned by recent deals giving cable 
systems exclusive rights for many sports events, such as the 175 major league 
baseball games to be shown in each of the next four years by cable network 
ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent and National Football League 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said cable broadcasts would add coverage for sports 
fans, not reduce it.

Los Angeles County agriculture officials completed an aerial assault earlier 
today against the Mediterranean fruit fly, spraying a 12-square-mile area of 
the San Fernando Valley with the pesticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters began spraying portions of North Hollywood, Studio City, 
Burbank and Toluca Lake about 9 p.m. Monday and continued until 1 a.m. today, 
said Bill Edwards, chief deputy with the Los Angeles County agricultural 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a pregnant female Medfly in North Hollywood on Nov. 14 
prompted the spraying, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides have already been sprayed over more than 100 square miles of Los 
Angeles County in the continuing battle against the Medfly, which poses a 
serious threat to California's $16-billion agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial sprayings in the Orange County city of Brea are planned for later this 
month following the discovery of a pregnant Medfly there. (Story, B1.)

They had been traveling north on the freeway near Hungry Valley Road when the

The cause of the accident has not been determined, but it appeared the driver

Former Federal Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. left a halfway house today, after 
serving 20 months of a five-year prison term for perjury and 18 days after the 
Senate removed him from office. 
</P>
<P>
"He was released on parole. He signed out at 8:15 a.m.," said Robert English, 
community corrections manager in New Orleans for the federal Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury convicted Nixon in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury when he 
denied discussing a marijuana case with a district attorney. He began serving 
his prison term March 23, 1988, nearly two years after being sentenced. The 
Senate voted Nov. 3 to remove him from office, stripping him of his title of 
U.S. district judge and $89,500 salary.

AGEN, France -- A trio of Gypsy burglars stole an official limousine of French 
First Lady Danielle Mitterrand and used it as a getaway car in a string of 
thefts in the Biarritz region, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-blue Renault 25, which was to collect the French president's wife from 
Biarritz airport and take her to their country house, was stolen from a hotel 
parking lot Sunday in the Atlantic coast resort of Vieux-Boucau-les-Bains. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it was recovered, the Elysee Palace car had carried the booty from 
six thefts from two supermarkets, a clothes boutique, a restaurant, an 
electric-appliance shop and a town hall.

Miami socialite Joyce Cohen was sentenced today to life in prison with no 
chance of parole for 40 years for hiring three hit men to kill her wealthy 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
"You committed this crime for financial gain. And you did it in a cold, 
criminal and extremely cruel manner," Circuit Judge Fredericka Smith told 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said, however, that there was no reason for her to override the jury's 
recommendation that Cohen be spared the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 36, was convicted Thursday of hiring three men to kill her 52-year-old 
husband, Stanley, on March 7, 1986, so she would not be left penniless if their 
loveless marriage ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-week trial, witnesses said the couple lived in the fast lane, 
using cocaine, socializing with celebrities, engaging in extramarital affairs 
and commuting by private jet to their ranch in Steamboat Springs, Colo.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today expressed support for the rapid changes 
encompassing Eastern Europe, including demands for reform in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union must undergo radical change because they 
lag behind the West technologically, Gorbachev told reporters after meeting 
with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 200,000 people filled Prague's streets demanding free 
elections and other freedoms, and tens of thousands demonstrated again today. 
Also, an official newspaper published an opposition call for the ouster of top 
Communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the changes under way now are consistent with the overall context of 
the changing world, a world that is changing in both the East and the West," 
Gorbachev told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the change is very important, and the importance of the change will be 
that it will create a better society, a more open society, a more democratic 
society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said Communist countries had fared badly compared with the way in 
which the West coped with the energy crisis in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union and in Eastern European countries at that time the 
situation looked more favorable and we miscalculated. We wasted time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to make up for lost time and this requires a more rapid pace of 
change."

Political leaders agreed today on a short-term government of the country's 
widely divided major parties, ending a stalemate produced by inconclusive 
elections this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The three parties agreed to support a government whose life-term will last 
until mid-April," conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold general elections in April follows four rounds of talks 
between President Christos Sartzetakis and conservative, socialist and 
communist leaders. Mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by 
a respected former Bank of Greece governor, Xenophon Zolotas, who is not a 
member of Parliament.

The House today voted for the third time to repeal catastrophic medical 
coverage for retirees, setting the scene for the Senate to offer one last 
proposal to salvage some of the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The House vote was 352 to 63. Senators were preparing to send the House a 
compromise offer to kill the unpopular surtax that finances catastrophic 
benefits under the Medicare system and preserve some parts of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"At this late date and hour, the only prudent action this House can take is 
force the Senate into voting for repeal," Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said 
as Congress looked for a solution to one of the two major obstacles to 
adjournment for the year.

Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec, in a sharp about-face, said today that 
non-Communists could join the government, but more than 200,000 protesters 
still took to the streets of Prague demanding the resignation of hard-line 
party leader Milos Jakes. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd jammed into the central Wenceslas Square only hours after Adamec was 
quoted as telling a group of dissidents that non-Communists could join the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the authorities would talk to the Charter 77 human rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
One of the participants at Adamec's meeting, journalist Michael Horacek, quoted 
the prime minister as saying there would be no more police action similar to 
last Friday's, when a demonstration by 50,000 people was violently suppressed 
by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec also announced an official inquiry into the police action, in which at 
least 38 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"He said there would be no massacre, no martial law," Horacek, who took part in 
the meeting as a mediator, told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Today's unprecedented meeting came a day after more than 200,000 people marched 
through Prague and in other cities calling for the resignation of the Communist 
leadership and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Adamec's reassurances, some students gathering in Wenceslas Square said 
the switchboard at their faculty building had received calls warning them 
security forces had orders to shoot at demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
As the pace of events picked up dramatically, the country's Roman Catholic 
Primate, Archbishop Frantisek Tomasek, added his voice to the growing chorus 
demanding change. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a democratic government, he said in a statement: "We must not wait, 
it is necessary to act. Raise your voices, all of you, no one should stand 
aside." 
</P>
<P>
Official accounts of Friday's demonstration have said 38 people were injured 
and eight are still hospitalized. Witnesses have said the number of people hurt 
was more. 
</P>
<P>
New protests were also staged today in the provinces, official Czechoslovak 
Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
It said 3,000 young people massed in the country's second largest city, 
Bratislava. The participants marched in procession to Hviezdoslav Square and 
later dispersed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said students went on strike at Bratislava University but the campus 
was calm. 
</P>
<P>
CTK news agency said universities also stopped classes at Kosice, Banska 
Bystrica and Zvolen.

The stock market wavered today, weighed down during most of the session by the 
latest bout of inflation worries, before advancing at the close. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.25 points to 2,639.29. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 836 down, 626 up and 520 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 147.90 million shares, up from 128.17 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.02 to 188.05. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.50 to 370.98. 
</P>
<P>
"People are pulling their horns in a little bit," said Ralph Acampora, an 
analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "There's a little apprehension, a little 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market took a closer 
look at the government report today on inflation, which was slightly worse than 
most analysts had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5% last month as 
higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest inflation surge 
since May. 
</P>
<P>
"That obviously didn't help" stock prices, said Bill Raftery, an analyst at 
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The government blamed the increase on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices 
for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. 
</P>
<P>
Much of today's selling focused on stocks of companies involved in takeover 
attempts, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop in the Dow 
average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense contractors especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called Sunday for a $180-billion reduction in 
military spending over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
Today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed Cheney's statements but 
said President Bush has not decided yet what defense expenditures he will 
propose to Congress for the next fiscal year.

Robert L. Barney, chairman of Wendy's International Inc., is retiring from the 
restaurant chain he helped build two decades ago, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's said it has no immediate plans to name a successor. Barney leaves May 
20, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Barney, 52, met Wendy's founder R. David Thomas when the two worked at a 
Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Columbus in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Barney helped Thomas begin the Wendy's hamburger chain, and served on its board 
of directors after the Nov. 15, 1969, founding in downtown Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
He became president in 1971, when Wendy's had two restaurants -- it now has 
3,800 -- and helped develop the company's franchising system. He was named 
chief executive officer in 1980 and chairman of the board in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's is generally seen as No. 3 behind McDonald's and Burger King, but has 
suffered losses in recent years that, by some accounts, have placed it No. 4, 
behind Hardee's Food Systems Inc. as well.

CONSUMER PRICES UP 0.5%; WORST DOSE OF INFLATION SINCE MAY

<P>
Consumer prices shot up 0.5% last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave 
the country its biggest inflation spurt since May, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The October increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index, 
</P>
<P>
which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9%, followed four months in 
which the index recorded modest monthly gains of 0.2% or less. 
</P>
<P>
The price spurt was slightly worse than analysts had been expecting. The 
government blamed a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices for new cars and a 
sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices for the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 10 months of this year, consumer prices have risen at an 
annual rate of 4.6%, up only slightly from the 4.4% price gains recorded in 
both 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists are predicting that the best news on inflation has passed and 
that coming months will show higher inflationary pressures. Still, few analysts 
are concerned that the price increases will worsen beyond annual rates of 
around 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflationary pressures had been masked during the summer because of 
big declines in energy prices. With energy prices now rebounding somewhat, 
analysts predicted that inflationary pressures will be intensifying in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation pressures are persisting despite the slowdown in the economy," said 
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch. "We had a long string of very 
moderate inflation reports but inflation was never as good as those numbers 
indicated." 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street took the latest inflation report in stride. The Dow Jones average 
of 30 industrials rose by almost six points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
In a second report today, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly 
earnings rose to $343.07 in October, 4% higher than a year ago, but not enough 
to keep up with inflation during this time period. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the October advance in the consumer price index was a 0.9% seasonally 
adjusted jump in gasoline costs, the biggest increase since a 3.9% surge in 
May. Gasoline prices have been on a roller coaster this year, soaring by 21.2% 
in the first five months of the year and then falling by 9.3% from June through 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The price that consumers actually paid at the pump was unchanged in October. 
However, gasoline prices normally fall in October, so the frozen prices 
translated into an increase after the Labor Department made its adjustments to 
take seasonal factors into account. 
</P>
<P>
Food costs were up 0.4% in October, the biggest advance since a 0.6% rise in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2%, reflecting higher costs for apples and 
bananas. Dairy products posted a huge gain for the second straight month, 
rising 1.8% for the biggest advance since May, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
New car prices were also up in October, rising by 0.6% after having fallen for 
five consecutive months. The jump reflected higher costs for the 1990 models 
and a big 1.3% rise in auto financing costs. Used-car prices, however, 
continued to decline, edging down 0.1% after a 0.7% drop in September.

"overworked and underpaid and under-appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's work force was slashed by 20% over the last six years as part of a 
campaign to modernize and streamline operations. Surveys showed increasing 
numbers of supervisors felt SSA was doing a poor job of providing top-quality 
service to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"When you combine cutbacks in the size of the agency with increased public 
demand for service, turmoil is likely to be the result," King said. "I believe 
we have to get beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
King said she would propose a new "compact" to her employees in an afternoon 
speech to 14,000 workers in Social Security's Baltimore-area offices. The 
address is to be beamed by satellite to other Social Security workers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
King promised to resist further staff cuts, adjust uneven staffing levels that 
create shortages in some offices, communicate with employees in advance of 
major program changes, provide more equipment such as computer terminals and 
relax unreasonably demanding job performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
Employees, meanwhile, will be asked to avoid internal strife, become proficient 
in new technologies, take a greater role in agency decisions and resolve to 
treat each member of the public "as a unique individual and not a case number 
or a file," she said.

A majority of the 57,800 machinists at Boeing approved a three-year contract 
overnight, ending a 7-week-old strike against the world's largest commercial 
aircraft maker. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the vote -- 81.4% of the workers approved the agreement -- were 
announced by union executives at the Kingdome stadium here where the workers 
gathered to mark their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1989 strike will be remembered as the strongest in our history," said Tom 
Baker, local president of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are glad it is over, and we are looking forward to welcoming the employees 
back to work Wednesday," a Boeing spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the three-year contract, the machinists will receive a wage 
increase of 4% the first year and 3% in the second and third years.

NBC's "The Cosby Show" was first again but the ABC miniseries "Small 
Sacrifices" ran a close second in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended Nov. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cosby was at the top for the third straight week and five other NBC 
comedies were in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Small Sacrifices," starring Farrah Fawcett as an Oregon woman convicted of 
shooting her children so that she could be with her boyfriend, was next with 
the last of two parts. The first part was 12th in the previous week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week by a wide margin. Its average in the A. C. Nielsen Co. survey 
was 16.0. ABC was second with 13.2 and CBS was third with 11.7. The rating is 
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned in to a 
program.

SQUABBLES PROMPT NUREYEV TO BOW OUT OF PARIS BALLET POST 
</P>

<P>
A 14-month battle between Rudolf Nureyev and the president of the Paris Opera 
Ballet ended today when the Soviet-born dancer resigned as dance director of 
the company he helped bring to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a meeting between Nureyev and ballet President Pierre 
Berge said the two "decided mutually that Nureyev should step down as dance 
director." 
</P>
<P>
The break, however, sounded more like a separation than divorce. The statement 
said Nureyev would stay on as "premier choreographer," a post created for him 
"to insure the presence of his productions at the Paris Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev, 51, had been artistic director since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris Opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks, with tensions 
mounting as Nureyev and Berge exchanged charges in the press. 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev's contract as dance director expired Aug. 31. Interviewed last month by 
the newspaper Le Figaro, he complained he had not heard from Berge, whom he 
later described as harder to reach than God. 
</P>
<P>
Berge retorted that it was difficult to communicate with someone who is so 
rarely in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev has been frequently absent. He is touring the United States with "The 
King and I" and is scheduled to play the lead role immortalized by Yul Brynner 
for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
Berge called for the dancer's contract to include a six-month residence clause 
with the ballet company -- which Nureyev was certain to refuse. Insiders said 
Berge hoped to boost the morale of the ballet company, which has not 
appreciated Nureyev's part-time, long-distance directing.

Crosby, Stills and Nash, whose rock music roots reach back to the early years 
of the Berlin Wall, sang to several hundred chilly fans today in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate, telling them to keep chipping away at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Stills said the 20-minute performance with sidekicks David Crosby and 
Graham Nash was arranged on short notice, with help from the West Berlin 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"We just showed up yesterday and said, 'Hi, we're here, we want to sing,' " 
Stills told his audience, which included longtime fans of the group, curious 
tourists gazing across the wall at the gate's classical columns, as well as 
Berliners attracted by the music from the nearby snow-dusted Tiergarten park. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby, Stills and Nash, survivors of various headline bands from the 
mid-1960s, are the latest to bring music to the celebration of East Germans' 
new freedom to travel through the Berlin Wall, erected in 1961 to stem a flow 
of refugees to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and rocker Joe Cocker were among the musicians to 
perform near the wall on the first weekend after the Nov. 9 decision to lift 
travel restrictions.

LIZ SMITH: BRITISH HUMOR RANKLES THE HOITY-TOITY IN N.Y. 
</P>

By LIZ SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
"IF YOU would succeed, you must not be too good," goes the Italian proverb. 
</P>
<P>
The British are very different from us Americans. Yes, they are. I am not 
writing this to poke fun at them, either -- I wouldn't want to insult people I 
like and admire, such as Nigel Dempster of the London Daily Mail, or Anna 
Wintour of Vogue, or Tina Brown of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The two top editor ladies tossed a very nice party last week at 150 Wooster 
Street in New York for their gossip columnist pal, Nigel, who is in the Big 
Apple to promote his book on the late Tina Onassis, "Heiress." But I am writing 
this to point out that sometimes, when it comes to British and American mores, 
never the twain shall meet. 
</P>
<P>
On the party night, Wintour and Brown had invited a gang of Class A talents and 
literary "Masters of the Universe." As you've no doubt read, the urbane and 
polished Dempster stood up to toast his glamorous hostesses and in so doing, he 
introduced a male friend, who he said had "murdered Christina Onassis" and then 
another, who had "taken her virginity." When this didn't draw such a big yuk 
from the barbaric Americans on hand, Nigel repeated some of it. There were 
embarrassed titters. 
</P>
<P>
One lady left the room for the bar. Numbers of others came up to me after to 
protest Nigel's bad manners. (I guess I AM responsible for the behavior of all 
my naughty fellows. At least I figure when one IS a gossip columnist going to a 
gala for another gossip columnist, one shouldn't act too hoity-toity.) I tried 
to explain that all this was just the English manner of fun and games. Twitting 
one's friends insultingly, writing about the aristocracy in the most awful way, 
expressing the unexpressable -- all as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
It was macho Brit time for Nigel and his friends. But it still didn't sit well 
with the New York gaggle of editors, writers, publishers and what-have-you. New 
York is perhaps too fraught -- and perhaps too hypocritical to "get real." Most 
of the folks on hand didn't even know the late Tina Onassis, but after all, she 
IS tragically dead at a young age. To make fun of her seemed a bit much, some 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Dempster's book is bang-up and first-rate, head and shoulders 
above his rather, but oh-so-British, juvenile after-dinner remarks. But then, 
Americans are so supersensitive. After all, most of us have never had titles to 
protect us. 
</P>
<P>
IRVING LAZAR has tossed another thunderbolt and brought another talent onto the 
writing scene. He got close to a million bucks from Putnam for a book to be 
written by Barbara Sinatra, to be titled, "The Luckiest Girl in the World/Life 
With Frank Sinatra." 
</P>
<P>
The beautiful blond Mrs. S. has done yeoman work for battered and abused 
children and maybe she will throw caution to the winds when she sits down at 
her word processor to tell us what it is like to live cheek by jowl with 
Himself. 
</P>

LENORE HERSHEY, the veteran one-time editor of the Ladies Home Journal, decided 
she would enter Esquire's short story contest, open to one and all, sponsored 
by Absolut vodka. Well, out of 1,400 entries, Lenore won with her steamy and 
sexy tale of political romance that she titled "Absolut Discretion." You can 
read this in the December issue while Lenore sits, proud as a peacock and 
gloating over all those whippersnappers she beat to the finish line.

After asking elementary school students at a Carnegie Library branch how old

YANKEES SIGN FREE AGENT PITCHER PEREZ; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: RIGHT-HANDER WHO HAS BEEN BATTLING A COCAINE PROBLEM WILL REPORTEDLY

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees, eager to improve their ineffective pitching staff, signed 
free agent right-hander Pascual Perez to a three-year guaranteed contract 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees did not release financial terms of the deal, but Perez reportedly 
will receive $5.1 million. The average of $1.7 million per year is double the 
$850,000 Perez earned in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 32, was 9-13 with a 3.31 ERA in 33 games this year for the Montreal 
Expos. In 198 1/3 innings, he walked only 45 while striking out 152. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lifetime record of 64-62 with a 3.48 ERA in six-plus seasons in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was originally signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates before 
the 1976 season. After pitching in the Pirates system, he was traded to the 
Atlanta Braves in 1982 before signing a minor league contract with the Expos 
before the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Perez has had serious problems off the field. 
</P>
<P>
He spent most of spring training this year in a drug-rehab center in Florida, 
trying to kick a cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he reportedly had tried twice before to voluntarily complete a 
rehab program. But the third time, which he spent at the Palm Beach Institute, 
came at the request of the Expos and the baseball commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"In getting Pascual, we are getting a quality pitcher," said George Bradley, 
the Yankees vice president of player personnel and development. "He will be one 
of our top starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very aware of his past problems. However, he has been involved in a 
program with the Expos which has kept him clean, and we will help him to remain 
with that program."

Memphis State football Coach Chuck Stobart, ending his first season with the 
Tigers with a 2-9 record, has fired six assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Stobart inherited the assistants when he replaced former Memphis State Coach 
Charlie Bailey in June. Bailey resigned a month earlier during an investigation 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. that put the Tigers on three years 
probation. The NCAA said Bailey advised a player to lie about an improper 
summer job supplied by a school booster. 
</P>
<P>
Stobart dismissed the assistants Monday but did not say when he planned to 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
Released by Stobart were offensive coordinator Darrell Dickey, defensive 
coordinator Pete Kuharchek, running backs coach Palmer Hossler, defensive line 
coach Tom Turchetta, defensive ends coach Jim Taubert and secondary coach Fred 
Manuel.

Tentative plans were announced today for a women's Ryder Cup match between 
Europe and the United States, with the inaugural series probably taking place 
at the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although details have yet to emerge, Joe Flanagan, executive director of the 
Womens Professional European Tour, said it was almost certain that a women's 
version of the Ryder Cup would begin in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident the match will take place next year, probably in November in 
America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men's Ryder Cup takes place every two years, alternating between the two 
continents. In September, Europe retained the cup after tying with the 
Americans at Belfry, England. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the Europeans would like the women's competition to include eight 
golfers per team instead of 12 per team, the men's format.

Medals and memorabilia belonging to Olympic hero Harold Abrahams, whose story 
was told in the movie "Chariots of Fire," fetched $39,720 at auction today. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-born entrepreneur Mohamed Fayed bought about 30 of Abrahams' medals, 
stopwatches he used during training and his Commander of the British Empire 
award bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, Christie's auctioneers said. 
</P>
<P>
The gold medal Abrahams won for the 100-meter race in the 1924 Paris Olympics 
was not among the items sold; it was stolen from his home about 50 years after 
his victory. 
</P>
<P>
Abrahams' struggles to win Olympic gold were portrayed by Ben Cross in the 1981 
Oscar-winning movie. He was the first and only Englishman to win the Olympic 
100 meters and gave up athletics after a fall in a long jump competition in 
1925. He died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I was inspired by a man who put principle before winning," said Fayed, who 
with his two brothers owns Harrods department store. The medals will go on 
display at Harrods before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Abrahams' adopted daughter, Susan Pottle, said she and her brother, Patrick, 
decided to sell the collection because it was languishing in a desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed a pity to just leave them there," she said. "We wanted it to go to 
someone who will treasure it or to a museum.
