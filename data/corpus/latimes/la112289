On Jan. 3, 1978, at 7:20 a.m., Ben Borg deserted the Navy after 14 years of 
service, five months shy of completing his final tour, Navy officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 1, at 3:45 p.m., local sheriffs in Clifton, Ariz., using helicopters and 
dogs, hunted down and arrested the 44-year-old electrician and brought him 
here, where he is now locked in the brig at the 32nd Street Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
In the time between leaving the Navy and his arrest earlier this month, Borg 
says, he nearly drank himself to death, recovered, got a good job at a copper 
mine, married, adopted two sons and lived as a patriotic war veteran in 
Clifton. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that he once was known as Charles Bartley Berg and served as an 
electrician with the Navy. Borg says, however, that he never deserted. He says 
he was discharged from the Navy in January, 1973, after 10 1/2 years of 
service, including one year in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ashamed to say I ever was a sailor," said Borg, during an interview with 
The Times at the brig on Saturday. "This is shameful, disgraceful and 
humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
Borg claims a clerical error has put him in jail. "If you have ever been in the 
military and seen some of the paper work, you wonder how they ever pay the 
electric bill," Borg said. "Somebody made a hell of a mistake with my records." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials, however, say a trial will prove whether they have the right 
man. Borg, who has already been in jail three weeks, will probably not come to 
trial for at least another 30 days, said Julie Swan, a spokeswoman for the 
naval station. Under military law, the Navy has 90 days to bring an individual 
to trial. If found guilty, Borg faces a maximum punishment of three years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
When informed that Borg says he was discharged, Swan said: "That's what the 
trial is all about. That will all be resolved as he presents his case." 
</P>
<P>
For Borg, the arrest and jailing already has cost him his $14-an-hour job at 
Phelps Dodge copper mining company, his wife, Terry Borg, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do the draft dodgers who went to Canada just have to come in and sign a 
paper to become free men, and my husband went to jail and has lost his job?" 
Terry asked. "It's not fair to slap a vet in the face." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, however, was not actively pursuing Borg, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy doesn't spend taxpayers' money seeking people," Swan said. "But, when 
persons are apprehended and returned to military authorities, then the 
procedure is activated to close the enlistment in a proper way." 
</P>
<P>
Cases such as Borg's, in which the alleged desertion occurred more than a 
decade ago, are unusual. Two years ago, Navy officials charged a 38-year-old 
Lancaster man with deserting in 1976. Guiles Gadsby, who served in Vietnam for 
the Army, was held in jail 38 days. At his trial, officials realized they had 
no case, he was freed and given $303 as compensation for time spent in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 2,613 Navy deserters; of those, about 70 have been listed for 
at least 20 years, said Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman in Washington. In 
desertion cases, there is no statute of limitations. During 1978, the year that 
the Navy alleges Borg left, desertion cases had soared to 13,948, the highest 
in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, a 6-foot-2 man who wears a hearing aid in his left ear, has always been 
patriotic, his wife and friends say. Every Veteran's Day, he hoisted a flag 
outside their three-bedroom mobile home. He encouraged his eldest stepson to 
join the Army and helped him train for boot camp. Every morning, he would coax 
him into running several miles, swimming and make him take apart and put back 
together the rifles that he had collected. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, he took his family to see the ships at San Diego's Navy 
base, his wife said. And Borg, a gaunt man who looks far older than his 44 
years, usually wore either a Navy or a veteran's hat, with his name embroidered 
on it. But today, he has changed his mind about his country and the military. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could find a job in Canada, I'd leave," Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Borg, who served as a petty officer 2nd class, nor the Navy disputes 
that he put in more than one decade of service and received five medals: two 
Good Conduct Awards, Vietnam Service Medal with a bronze star, Republic of 
Vietnam Campaign Medal and National Defense Service Medal. But they disagree on 
how much time he served and whether he had been discharged when he left. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of service, he had re-enlisted for another four-year stint on 
May 16, 1974, said Swan, spokeswoman for the Naval Station. Navy officials say 
Borg left, without authorization, his last assignment at the Naval Inactive 
Ships Facility in Bremerton, Wash. He was reported missing Jan. 3, 1978, at 
7:20 a.m. -- five months before completion of his final tour -- and declared a 
deserter one month later. 
</P>
<P>
Borg has a different story. He says he departed in January, 1973, after being 
discharged and after 10 1/2 years of service. Borg decided to leave the Navy 
when his first wife wrote to say she was leaving him and selling his property, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despairing over his personal problems, Borg said, he began drinking. He went on 
the wagon after several years of heavy drinking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he changed his name in 1975 to Ben Borg to shake his reputation as a 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Clifton, Ariz., where he met Terry, a 37-year-old co-worker at the 
copper mine. He married Terry after nursing her through a battle with cancer, 
in which she had tumors removed from her arm and leg. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Borg legally adopted his wife's two younger sons, Ray, 17, and 
Michael, 15. In the process of adopting the two boys, officials conducted a 
routine background check that included his fingerprints. Seeing nothing 
untoward, Borg was given custody of the boys, said Andy Anderson, acting 
program manager with Arizona's Department of Economic Security. 
</P>
<P>
The background check may have alerted local police that, under the name Berg, 
he was wanted by the Navy, said a Naval Investigative Services official. 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween, local sheriffs questioned Borg, who agreed to return for 
fingerprints. Late that night, however, he took a pistol and hiked six hours 
into the woods. When deputies learned that Borg was no longer at his house, 
they went after him. Using a helicopter and 10 men on foot, including two with 
dogs, they found and arrested Borg, who made no attempt to resist. 
</P>
<P>
In the small town, population 4,200, almost 200 miles from Phoenix, the arrest 
was big news. 
</P>
<P>
"The most excitement we'd had was when a truck driver went nuts and went 
through a red light. We only got four lights," said Ted Johnson, 40, who works 
in a gun shop and also installs lights. But Borg's "arrest outdid that. He was 
the talk of the whole town." 
</P>
<P>
And the townspeople quickly took sides. At work, a colleague tore the license 
tags from Borg's truck and tossed them to the ground, telling Terry that her 
husband was a liar, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But others, including Johnson, stood by Borg. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is the nicest, gentlest person you could meet -- he never raised his 
voice," Johnson said. "I'm not trying to make it sound like he was God and 
walked on water, but he did always tuck his shirttails in." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials and Greenlee County Undersheriff Larry Gale said they were 
uncertain about how Borg reached the attention of local authorities. Once 
arrested, Borg was turned over to Navy officials in San Diego, the closest Navy 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Terry visited her husband in the brig Saturday, seeing him for the first time 
since he was taken from home. The two sat across a table from one another, 
clasping fingers as Terry fought tears. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm very angry," said Borg, who laced his rage with humor and added, "I'm 
getting tired of being called 'Pops.' And the coffee hasn't improved." 
</P>
<P>
Terry and her husband both worry that the Navy has ruined their lives in the 
small town. 
</P>
<P>
"You ever been slapped in the mouth?" Borg said. "This is a lot worse."

OFFICIALS OUTLINE SCHEME OF EMBEZZLEMENT SUSPECT

<P>
Louis Fowler, a former state accountant arrested for allegedly embezzling $5.1 
million in state funds, was a bodybuilder and "ladies' man" who liked to come 
to work in shorts and muscle shirts, former co-workers recalled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1983, less than five months after he began working for the state 
Water Resources Control Board, Fowler allegedly diverted the first $4,400 in 
what authorities said was a simple scheme to siphon off money intended for 
sewage treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look back, it does seem a little surprising that he would be quite so 
peacock-like in his demeanor," said Randy Kanouse, a water board employee who 
knew Fowler casually. "I guess he felt very confident in what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, viewed by co-workers as "pleasant" and "good-looking," allegedly forged 
a wide variety of documents and created a fictitious agency known as the 
Sacramento Community Services District. He then doled out money to the 
"district" every few months in a pattern that resembled routine contract 
expenditures, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In his largest single transfer, state investigators say, Fowler shifted $1.3 
million to the phony agency in October, 1983. After allegedly making a final 
transfer of $861,800 in March, 1985, Fowler quit his state job, telling one 
co-worker he was going into the video rental business. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, 35, was arrested last weekend in Mesa, Ariz., where he had been living 
under the name of William David Rice. Fowler's ex-wife, Jill Baume, 26, was 
arrested in Sacramento. Both had access to the accounts where the money was 
transferred, Department of Justice investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Fowler allegedly took the money, he has adopted a modest, low-key life 
style in Mesa, where he operated a video rental store. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Fowler's home after his arrest uncovered a sock filled with a dozen 
South African gold krugerrands, some Mexican and Canadian gold coins and $3,500 
in cash, police said. Authorities also found mounds of documents, military 
smoke flares, large firecrackers and unsophisticated plastic explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are uncertain what has happened to most of the money Fowler is 
accused of taking. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Schmidt, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said a 
cursory reading of the documents found in the house indicated that Fowler had 
placed more than $5.1 million into a series of dummy corporations. 
Investigators are now focusing their attention in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is certainly no $5 million cash in the house," said Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, held on $6.8 million bail, has been charged with 17 felony counts of 
grand theft and tax evasion. He is fighting extradition to California. 
</P>
<P>
At a Sacramento Municipal Court arraignment Tuesday, Baume pleaded innocent to 
three charges of filing a false tax return and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ana Bravo asserted that Baume received at least $140,000 in 
the embezzled funds, including $40,000 in a 1986 divorce settlement and $80,000 
from Fowler to open a yogurt shop in Sacramento called Yogurt Obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Baume, who was married to Fowler for about a year and a half, told 
investigators when she was arrested that her ex-husband provided her with the 
money, Bravo said. Baume also told investigators that Fowler provided her with 
about six payments of $3,000 to $4,000 this year and in 1988 when the yogurt 
shop needed cash, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo said it appears that Baume invested in the stock market and authorities 
are investigating to determine whether she and Fowler made other investments in 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew all along that the money was stolen," the prosecutor said of Baume. 
</P>
<P>
"We will offer no (plea bargain) deals in this case. We have enough evidence to 
convict both of them. We don't need her testimony against him." 
</P>
<P>
Baume, dressed in a gray sweat shirt and dark slacks, watched Judge Jane Ure 
closely throughout the hearing but showed no emotion. At one point in the 
arraignment, her mother, Susan Baume, shouted out from the audience in defense 
of her daughter, but was told by the judge to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
In divorce papers filed by Fowler and Baume, they declared that they had "no 
community assets or liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler had worked for the state on and off since he was 21 -- including a 
10-month stint at the Department of Justice, which is now spearheading the 
investigation into his activities. 
</P>
<P>
From 1975 to 1978, Fowler worked as an accounting clerk at the Public Employees 
Retirement System, according to his personnel records at the water board. From 
there, he moved to the Department of Justice, where he was an accounting 
technician in the accounts payable section until early 1979. Between 1980 and 
1982, he was employed as an accounting specialist in the Employment Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Kati Corsaut, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, said investigators would 
begin reviewing his past jobs to see if there is evidence of embezzlement 
earlier in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged theft would have gone unnoticed but for a confidential tipster who 
told the Department of Justice in January that Fowler had taken money from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Bianchini, who was once Fowler's supervisor at the water board, said he was 
stunned by the charges. "It blew my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchini joined others in describing Fowler as a "ladies' man" who dated many 
women while working at the water board. He noted that Fowler was a bodybuilder 
who had a special interest in video equipment. He described Baume as "a quiet, 
shy" woman. 
</P>
<P>
In Mesa, Fowler was living with Denise J. Petrovich, who owned the home where 
he was arrested, police said. Petrovich was cooperative with police and, after 
Fowler's arrest, voluntarily agreed to open some of her safety deposit boxes 
for them, police spokesman Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-story house with a back yard pool and spa was decorated with expensive 
furniture and featured an elaborate video system, a tanning bed and a large 
safe. Behind the house was an 18-foot Bayliner ski boat believed to be 
Fowler's. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile away from the house, a video shop Fowler had operated since early 
1986 was closed and barren of everything except a stool, four large filled 
plastic bags and some plastic fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Paddock reported from Sacramento and Reich reported from Mesa, Ariz. Also 
contributing to this story were Times staff writers Carl Ingram and Jerry 
Gillam in Sacramento.

Steven M. Gold, a 63-year-old West L.A. man, has filed a $1-million lawsuit, 
claiming that while he was addicted to cocaine he was cheated out of his share 
of a music production company by his ex-partner. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the firm: Far Out Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Two centers of movie-making in their respective countries -- L.A. and Giza, 
Egypt -- are close to becoming sister cities. Visiting Giza Gov. Omar Abdel 
Aakher, speaking through an interpreter, told the City Council he is optimistic 
that such a relationship can soon be established. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. has had an opening on its sister-city roster for 10 years now. It was 
right after the Americans were taken hostage in Iran that L.A. disowned its 
sister city of . . . Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
First, demonstrators in Eastern European nations carry his big-earred visage 
while declaring they want no "Mickey Mouse" government. Then a consumer group 
demonstrating dangerous toys sets fire to a Mickey Mouse pillow at a Washington 
conference. Heck of a birthday celebration to give the Hollywood-born rodent, 
who turned 61 last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Sutton was once quoted as saying he robbed banks because that's where 
the money is. The promoters of the Long Beach Auto Show are advertising eight 
hours a day on the freeways 'cause that's where the cars are. Their vehicle is 
a flatbed truck carrying a 24-foot-long sign. It's a mobile billboard, except, 
of course, during rush-hour traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to have a really redundant experience, Sylvain Fribourg of Woodland 
Hills points out that you could visit the La Brea Tar Pits ("the the Tar Tar 
pits") and order a pizza pie. 
</P>
<P>
The latter, Fribourg notes, translates as " 'pie pie,' or maybe 'pie squared.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
It's questionable whether Stanley or Livingstone could have found their way 
from L.A.'s Hall of Records to its underground archives, where old court 
documents are stored. 
</P>
<P>
And that's even with the aid of a photocopy of hand-lettered directions 
furnished to visitors by guards in the records lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny scrap of paper directs explorers to find an elevator and descend to 
"B," where the adventure really starts. 
</P>
<P>
Making the journey even more intriguing is the fact that the map once 
instructed adventurers to follow the "blue" arrows through the shadowy 
catacombs, but has been altered to say "red" arrows. Was white-out eraser fluid 
from the office of the city treasurer used? 
</P>
<P>
Great Moments in Doo Dah History, in honor of Sunday's edition of the 
Tournament of Roses parody (or should that be, paradey?) in Pasadena: 
</P>
<P>
"One year, we had a woman from Santa Barbara who was a cave woman in the 
parade," recalls Doo Dah czar Peter Apanel. 
</P>
<P>
"About six months later, she met her biological mother, who had given her up at 
birth. And, by coincidence, it turns out the mother had been at the parade. And 
she remembered seeing the cave woman. So, that means that the first time she 
saw her daughter in 35 years, the daughter was swinging a bone and grunting and 
carrying a dinosaur skeleton."

Far out.

Why do some teaching assistants feel aggrieved (Metro, Nov. 6)? After 10 years 
as a heliarc welder, certified in aluminum and stainless steel, I earned $7.50 
an hour at my last welding job. According to my last Los Angeles Unified School 
District pay stub, I now earn $9.44 an hour at a job that required only that I 
be a college student at the time I was hired. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching assistant has never been a career position. It is, instead, an 
excellent opportunity for college students to make money and gain teaching 
experience. Apparently that's not enough for some people, most of whom have 
never made so such money in their lives, I'll bet. They want a permanent place 
at the public trough, without all the effort of becoming a certificated teacher 
or even taking a civil service exam. They should be ignored. There are plenty 
of college students willing to work for $9.44 if the unionists won't.

EXCLUSION IN PRIVATE CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stein's article has many valid observations, but if "Jews have long since 
stopped caring about restricted clubs as a high priority," they should not do 
so. Nor should they react as Stein reacts when he states, "As for me, the 
racially exclusive club no longer makes me angry or hurt." There is a 
"trickle-down" aspect to anti-Semitism. It may not be sound economics, but it 
is sound prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
When prestigious clubs restrict Jews, this trickles down to all levels of 
society. I do not look upon this practice as an illness or comparable to drug 
addiction. It is a practice which perpetuates anti-Semitism, and has no place 
in a fair and just society.

I wondered what explanations the fundamental liberal media elitists would 
conjure up to save face after yet another attempt to brainwash the public into 
thinking that a handful of "religious extremists" was all that was backing 
passage of the repeal of special rights ordinances in Irvine, Concord and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
I thought the excuse for San Francisco was original: the earthquake. And I also 
heard someone on a San Francisco talk show say that in off-year elections, 
there's a more conservative turnout. I guess you could use that alibi for the 
Irvine and Concord results as well. I have an explanation of my own. How about 
this: The majority of voters in these cities (and they can't all be "religious 
extremists") did not want the unequal special rights ordinances forced on them 
by a few politicians.

Gee. "On Tuesday, White America Came of Age," says the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
(Op-Ed Page, Nov. 9). "But after Tuesday's elections, we are now one important 
step closer to the day when, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we in 
America judge other people not by the color of their skin. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the New York City election 98% of the blacks voted for the black candidate. 
Wow. Like affirmative action in the polling booth, eh, Jesse?

THE EXECUTION OF PRIESTS AND U.S. POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: CRISTIANI AND BUSH HAVE ALREADY SET UP A PRETENSE OF SEEKING 
JUSTICE, AND ONCE AGAIN CONGRESS WILL BE COWED. OR WILL IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. PHILIP ARAM and NICK ALLEN, A. Philip Aram is the pseudonym of a New 
York-based journalist who covered El Salvador from 1982 to 1985. Nick Allen is 
a Washington writer who has visited El Salvador several times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the murder of six priests, the Jesuit-nurtured reason that sought to 
illuminate the Salvadoran body politic has been extinguished, and El Salvador 
is on the brink of another dark spiral of violence. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the latest in a series of Salvadoran assassinations provoked the 
usual promises of an investigation and threats by liberals in Congress to cut 
off the $500 million a year in U.S. aid. But it seems only fair to the memory 
of the slain Jesuits, who were among the few in their country with the wisdom 
and resources to think about the future, that American policy-makers take this 
sad juncture as a mandate to seriously examine their failure. 
</P>
<P>
The six Jesuits targeted by assassins were not simple parish priests. They were 
among the few voices of reason and reform not already dead or exiled. Ignacio 
Ellacuria, rector of El Salvador's most prestigious university, was a force in 
persuading the FMLN to enter into negotiations with the right-wing government 
of Alfredo Cristiani. Ignacio Martin-Baro, the vice rector, was El Salvador's 
leading pollster. The other four priests also were eminent figures who cannot 
be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the impact that their deaths will have, imagine that the leading 
lights of Harvard have just been rounded up, tortured and murdered, their 
bodies left in Harvard Yard. The attorney general warns other academics that 
they should leave the country if they want to stay alive. He promises an 
investigation but puts the police off-limits, although police-issue weapons 
were used and witnesses claim that there were 20 to 30 policemen at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
When the authorities kill a country's leading reformist thinkers, what kind of 
message does that send about reform, or about thinking itself? 
</P>
<P>
Following a time-tested script, in San Salvador and in Washington everyone is 
calling for an investigation; the United States, which has spent $14 million in 
the last five years on a so-called Judicial Reform Project, dispatched forensic 
specialists. But it is the Salvadoran attorney general who will oversee the 
government's investigation, and already he has blamed the FMLN guerrillas for 
the killings and urged the country's liberal Catholic bishops to leave (whether 
this is a warning or a threat is unclear). President Bush says that he has 
urged Cristiani to "get to the bottom of this" -- but he has accepted 
Cristiani's assurance that the government wasn't involved, thereby foreclosing 
the most promising avenue of inquiry. It was left to the normally cautious 
archbishop, Arturo Rivera y Damas, to voice what every honest Salvador-watcher 
thinks: the "extremely strong presumption that the assassins . . . are elements 
of the armed forces or those intimately tied to them." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of the Foreign Relations Committee, one of the leaders 
of the half-hearted, just-before-adjournment effort to reduce aid, told David 
Brinkley that "the status quo cannot prevail." 
</P>
<P>
But in the coming months, it probably will. The investigation will go nowhere. 
Congress will again threaten an aid cut-off. The White House will hint at what 
it has known all along: that the Salvadoran military killed the Jesuits. The 
Administration will pledge vigilance to ensure that justice is done. Congress 
will be temporarily mollified. A breakthrough in the investigation will be 
announced; arrests may be made. A few enlisted men may even be convicted. But 
sooner or later, as the investigation fails to bag higher-ups and Congress' 
complaints accelerate, the White House will resort to red-baiting. The 
accusation of "losing El Salvador" has always been enough to discourage 
Democratic dissent in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that U.S. policy, naively aimed at bolstering the middle in El 
Salvador, is being manipulated by the extremes. Building up an army to beat the 
guerrillas has only strengthened a military clique whose basic motivation is to 
feather its nest and protect its own. The army has shown no willingness to 
prosecute officers implicated in criminal activity. And the Administration 
cannot threaten the integrity of the army by forcing it to purge itself, 
because that would cripple U.S. efforts to eliminate the FMLN. Hard-line 
elements of the army see right through U.S. promises on human rights to the 
bottom line. The FMLN, meanwhile, strikes hard at this contradiction, knowing 
that its own military offensive will harden the army against peace talks and 
provoke further acts of barbaric violence against the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has many reasons for wishing the FMLN not to come to power, 
and many Salvadorans agree. But events like the murder of the priests should 
remind us what the FMLN is fighting for. There have been elections in El 
Salvador for several years now, but there is still no justice. As difficult as 
it is to stomach the idea of a guerrilla victory, how much longer do we want to 
pour millions into a military force that has no intention of reforming itself 
or the social order it upholds?

On the front page (Nov.17) were the following two headlines: "Six Jesuit 
Priests Slain in Salvador" and "Pro-Choice Lawmaker Is Barred From Church 
Rite." I'm sure I'm not the only person to notice the incredible irony of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, we see dedicated Jesuit priests willing to die for their beliefs, 
one of which is their concept of freedom. On the other hand, we have a priest 
withholding a sacrament because an elected official has used her freedom to 
disagree with the church. What's wrong with this picture?

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A PIONEERING STEP FOR THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a place whose most recognized artwork might be the statue of John Wayne at 
the airport named for him, Orange County is spreading its wings in the display 
of public art. First, one of the county's largest landowners has disclosed a 
plan to levy a fee on builders that will make artworks part of the public 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if the County Board of Supervisors approves a $250,000-per-year art 
plan for the airport's new terminal Dec. 22, one of the county's most visible 
locations would become a center for the fine arts and the performing arts under 
a plan financed primarily by airport user fees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the first proposal by Foothill Ranch Co., a subsidiary of Hon 
Development, nearly all companies that plan to build in their 2,700-acre, 
$2-billion planned community in South County will be required to contribute 1% 
of their construction costs to an art fund to place murals, sculpture and other 
art in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, of course, have commissioned artworks in the past. Eight years ago, 
developer Henry T. Segerstrom commissioned prestigious artist Isamu Noguchi to 
design a rock sculpture garden in the South Coast Plaza Town Center corporate 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
But the Foothill proposal apparently marks the first time in Southern 
California that a developer has taken the initiative in proposing a 
full-fledged arts program. Most such programs are imposed on developers by 
government agencies such as the city of Brea, whose public arts program so far 
has produced more than 90 artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's precedent-setting program comes at a time when the housing market 
has slowed and prices are rising -- by no means reassuring trends for building 
investors who hope to recoup the added cost of artworks. And there is always a 
question of whether the public will find the art worthy. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Hon Development executive Gerald E. Buck, who came up with the idea for 
the arts program, said, the company seized a unique opportunity to do something 
special. Hon is to be commended.

AGAIN, AMERICA'S CUP DEFENDED BY LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club will get yet another day in court in its 
pursuit of the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprising announcement Tuesday, the Appellate Division of the New York 
Supreme Court said it had granted leave for New Zealand to take its case to the 
last possible legal venue, the New York Court of Appeals. No vote or reason was 
given in the terse announcement. 
</P>
<P>
New York Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick had ruled March 28 that San 
Diego's use of a catamaran to defend the Cup last year was illegal and awarded 
sailing's top prize to Mercury Bay. The Appellate Division overturned that 
decision by a 4-1 vote Sept. 19, and lawyers on both sides said the lopsided 
ruling provided little chance that New Zealand would be allowed to appeal 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Trepte, chairman of San Diego's America's Cup Defense Committee, said: 
"(The) decision makes life even more difficult for our fledgling defense 
syndicates. Non-American syndicates will continue to design, build and train, 
knowing they will be challengers in either San Diego or New Zealand." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidental with the court's announcement, representatives of 10 potential 
defense syndicates -- including those featuring Dennis Conner and his former 
Stars &amp; Stripes navigator, Peter Isler, as skippers -- met Tuesday in San 
Diego to discuss plans for the defender selection trials. 
</P>
<P>
ACOC spokesman Tom Mitchell said the ruling "doesn't change our plans." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, San Diego had hoped to defend the Cup in 1991. The legal fight 
pushed it into '92, and now the major concern is that it will be carried into 
'93 because, by agreement of the major potential competitors, no defense can 
start until 24 months following the end of all litigation relating to the 
previous defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercury Bay was saying not long ago how they wanted to expedite this," 
Mitchell said. "We're going to hold them to that. If they don't file for an 
expedited hearing, we will." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's lawyers indicated that if both sides file papers early in December, 
a hearing could be conducted in January and a decision rendered by March -- 
still a two-month leeway in looking to a defense round starting in May of '92. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups at Tuesday's meeting represented five potential defense syndicates 
from San Diego, one each from Long Beach and San Francisco and three from the 
East Coast.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: LOSES GROW FOR SDSU AFTER MIAMI DEFEAT

The San Diego State football team might have lost more than a game to Miami 
last Saturday. The Aztecs might have lost several key players for their Western 
Athletic Conference season-finale Saturday night against Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve offensive tackle Chuck Hardaway (ankle) is out, and three starters and 
the Aztecs' two long snappers are listed as questionable for the 7:05 game at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Listed as questionable are offensive tackle Tony Nichols (ankle), snappers 
Jason Bill (ankle) and Jim Jennings (ankle), and both starting defensive ends 
-- Todd Coomes (knee) and Steve Matuszewicz (knee). All except Matuszewicz, who 
injured his left knee in practice Tuesday, were hurt in the 42-6 loss at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill said he is concerned about the possibility of missing so 
many key players, but he might be most worried about the snappers because he 
has no experienced backups. He said his third choice at snapper likely would be 
either freshman reserve quarterback David Lowery or freshman linebacker Bob 
Shults. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Palomar College, which won its first football championship in the 45-year 
history of the program, will play Ventura College in the Fifth Annual Hall of 
Fame Bowl Dec. 2 at 1:30 p.m. at Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar, the Mission Conference Southern Division champion, won its final five 
games to finish 6-4. Ventura (7-3) finished second to Moorpark in the Western 
State Conference Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

second team and middle blocker Jennifer Miller was named to the all freshman

points and 11 rebounds for UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flores, who played at Mt. Miguel High, had 28 points and 19 rebounds for 
Point Loma Nazarene, but Cal State San Bernardino defeated the Crusaders, 
87-80, in San Bernardino.

TURPIN TIME NO LONGER MEANS DINNER TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harvey Grant leaned into the crowd surrounding Mel Turpin's locker and posed 
this provocative question: 
</P>
<P>
"Do y'all know what time it is?" 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Turpin Time," came the loud and clear answer from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Grant liked the group response so much, he tried it again. And so it went, for 
the 30 minutes or so it takes the Bullets to shower and dress and entertain 
inquiring sportswriters. That it sounded a lot like a pep rally should be no 
surprise. The Bullets had beaten Milwaukee, 97-91, to close out a five-game 
losing streak Tuesday night that might have been six except for the unlikely 
presence of one Mel Turpin, who used to look more like two Mel Turpins. 
</P>
<P>
There were more cheers out on the floor, too, when the slumbering Cap Centre 
crowd erupted into a chant of "Mel, Mel, Mel." That was after Turpin had 
stuffed Jack Sikma in the closing minutes, his third block of the fourth 
quarter, to go with three rebounds and five points. 
</P>
<P>
"When the fans responded like that, it gave everybody a lift," said Mark 
Alarie. "We kind of went, 'Wow.' He blocks Sikma's shot. He gets big rebounds. 
It was fun to watch him out there." 
</P>
<P>
OK, Turpin Time. For most of Mel-Mel-Mel's life, Turpin Time has been marked by 
the sound of the dinner bell. If he seemed to be the hungriest player on the 
court Tuesday night, that's only because he was. This is a guy who had eaten 
his way out of the league, forcing him into exile last season in Spain (yeah, 
he liked the food there, too) and back home for one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets, in desperate need of a big man, were not looking for someone quite 
that big, however. When he came to summer rookie camp, Turpin, who is 
6-foot-11, weighed in at 286. And that was before lunch. The Bullets put him on 
a weight program -- lifting weight, not gaining it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 259 now," he said. "And I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
The last time he was under 260, he says, was in college. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what year, he smiled. "Come on. This is a new year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bullets, actually, it looks a lot like last year. It's pretty much the 
same cast, adding rookie Tom Hammonds, who has done little to impress so far, 
and Turpin. The Bullets play with desire and will and win more games than they 
should. But, Tuesday night, they were tired. Just home from a six-game, 
eight-day trip to the Far West, they didn't figure to be too vital. And as the 
third quarter came to a close, they were losing ground to a physical Milwaukee 
team that will wear you down. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Wes Unseld had basically run out of options. He looked down the bench, 
saw Turpin (could he miss him?) and sent him into the game, Turpin's first 
minutes at home. A few of the fans noticed. Maybe the Milwaukee Bucks did, too, 
but maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping he would maintain for a few minutes until John (Williams) got 
some rest," Unseld said. "It was no stroke of genius. I didn't know what else 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
To that point, Turpin had played 24 minutes the entire season and hadn't 
exactly worked his way into Unseld's heart. For Unseld, it was an act of 
desperation, not an act of faith. But, then, before everyone's eyes was the 
new, lean and mean Turpin on the break, getting a hoop. There he was 
rebounding. He blocked a Ricky Pierce layup, starting a fast break. He took the 
ball on the wing, faked Sikma into the air, and drove for a dunk. The place 
went a little nuts. 
</P>
<P>
It was a one-point Bullets lead, at 88-87, when Turpin blocked a Sikma shot for 
the second time, preserving an advantage the Bullets never lost to put their 
record at 6-6. Turpin played 13 minutes in a row. Sikma, who scored eight in 
the third quarter, failed to score in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't winded," Turpin said. "I was sweating, though. The weight has always 
been my problem, and now I feel like a different person out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to stay loose, to be ready to go in whenever Wes called. But I 
was more loose than I thought I was."

Freshman Tracy Murray scored 16 points and pulled down six rebounds to lead 
UCLA to an 80-68 exhibition victory over the Australian National Team Tuesday 
night in front of 5,341 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Aussies found themselves down under in a hurry, giving up 27 consecutive 
points and missing 14 shots in a row after taking a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But they closed to within 55-49 midway through the second half as guard Philip 
Smyth made four three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's three freshmen -- Murray, Zan Mason and Mitchell Butler -- then scored 
all but one of the Bruins' next 17 points as they pulled away in their final

HAWKS END PISTONS' HOME WINNING STREAK AT 25

<P>
There is an alarming trend in the NBA. In the first month of the new season, 
home teams are winning almost 75% of the games. 
</P>
<P>
That was the situation in the early years of pro basketball, and owners felt it 
was a good thing because it built attendance. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the case anymore. With most teams televising their road games, a 
million or so fans see them lose most of the time. Only 15,000 or so see them 
win at home. 
</P>
<P>
The season is not quite a month old, but only the Lakers (2-1) have a winning 
record away from home. 
</P>
<P>
That's part of the reason why the Atlanta Hawks' 103-96 victory over the 
Detroit Pistons Tuesday night at Auburn Hills was such a surprise. It ended the 
Pistons' 25-game winning streak at home. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, it was a rather easy victory. The Hawks, who were handled easily in 
their first two games of the season -- -- both at home -- -- raced in front 
early, and the Pistons didn't get closer than three points in the last three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone and John Battle sank seven of their first eight shots to help the 
Hawks to a 21-point lead in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
By scoring the last eight points in the half, the Pistons trailed, 63-50. Early 
in the third, they cut it to 70-67, but that was their final burst. 
</P>
<P>
Malone finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds. Isiah Thomas led the NBA 
champions (6-4) with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 121, Chicago 110 -- Michael Jordan, hampered by the flu and tendinitis 
in his right knee, had only 16 points, and the Bulls lost their third 
consecutive game on their trip West. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Jordan's problems, the Bulls stayed close until the closing minutes in 
a game that was tied 28 times. Jordan was five for 13 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls trailed, 95-94, with 9:12 left, but the Blazers scored eight points 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 119, Boston 111 -- The Pacers, cutting way back on their turnovers and 
getting a big game from Chuck Person, improved to 5-3 and are leading the 
Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Person scored 18 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter at Indianapolis to hold 
off the Celtics. The Celtics are 1-5 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird scored eight points in an 18-7 Celtics' rally that cut the Indiana 
lead to 74-73. But Mike Sanders sank a jumper and Person took charge in the 
last 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers had only six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 97, Milwaukee 91 -- After losing their last five games on the trip 
West, the Bullets were happy to get home. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King scored seven points in the last 2:38, and seldom-used Mel Turpin 
blocked three shots in the closing minutes to give the Bullets the win. 
</P>
<P>
New York 114, Houston 106 -- At New York, the first matchup between Patrick 
Ewing and Akeem Olajuwon was as advertised, but it was a move by Knick rookie 
Coach Stu Jackson that was decisive. 
</P>
<P>
With four minutes left in regulation, Jackson benched playmaker Mark Jackson in 
favor of Rod Strickland. Strickland directed the Knicks to an overtime victory. 
He had 10 points, a key steal from Olajuwon late in regulation and five 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 103, Minnesota 101 -- The Jazz, trailing most of the game at Minneapolis, 
had to go to overtime to avoid a loss to the expansion team. Karl Malone led 
the late rally and finished with 39 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 107, Phoenix 98 -- Rookie center David Robinson continues to 
perform to expectations for the Spurs. In this game at San Antonio, he had 20 
points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, playing without playmaker Kevin Johnson, are 0-4 on the road and 4-0 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 98, Charlotte 87 -- Former Laker Billy Thompson had his bridgework 
knocked out by the elbow of Hornet rookie J.R. Reid in the third quarter at 
Miami. Thompson scored 14 of his 25 points after the accident to lead the Heat 
to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 114, New Jersey 84 -- The SuperSonics, criticized by the Seattle media 
for lack of spirit, put on their best show of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics held the Nets to seven points in the third quarter and outscored the 
visitors, 65-25 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 115, Sacramento 113 -- Six teams have not won on the road. The 
expansion Magic are not one of them. With Jerry Reynolds scoring 28 points, the 
Magic improved to 2-3 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 111, Dallas 95 -- Alex English, finally out of Coach Doug Moe's 
doghouse, scored 18 points at Denver to lead the romp. Blair Rasmussen added 16 
points and 13 rebounds. DAN HAFNER

ROYAL MEETS MATCH IN STATE VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of the Royal High girls' volleyball team packed the Highlander gym 
Tuesday night to see if the team could write another chapter to its fairy tale 
season in the first round of the state Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Highlanders, who went from being unranked to Southern Section 4-A 
Division champions, ended the year by dropping a 15-8, 15-13, 15-8 decision to 
Torrey Pines at Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what no one thought we could," Royal outside hitter Stephanie Champ 
said, reflecting on the season. "We knew we could and (we) showed everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Except Torrey Pines. The Highlanders (18-2), who relied on defense all season, 
finally found a team that played that part of the game a little better. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (23-3), in the state tournament for the sixth time in the past 
nine years, allowed Royal only one sustained rally in the match. 
</P>
<P>
"They were picking up balls off the floor," Royal Coach Bob Ferguson said. 
"That's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Royal, making its first appearance in the state tournament, trailed, 5-0, in 
the second game before scoring 11 of the next 14 points. Three of those points 
came on kills by Jennifer Hamilton, helping Royal to an 11-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But after Torrey Pines scored the next five points, a kill by Champ and Beth 
Kohs' service ace pulled Royal to within 14-13. But that was as close as the 
Highlanders got. 
</P>
<P>
Royal fell behind, 13-3, in the third game before rallying with five 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
Two Torrey Pines points later, however, a 15-game Royal winning streak and 
memorable season ended with a standing ovation from the Highlander faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the team tried to put it all in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We never wanted to lose because we were having so much fun," outside hitter 
Kohs said. "But we're happy to get as far as we got." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton led Royal with eight kills and six blocks. Wende Brown and Alison 
Bantel each had six kills. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines was led by Jennifer Merideth with 15 kills.

SYLMAR'S CASEY ENJOYING FUN AND GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So what's next for Jerome Casey? 
</P>
<P>
Want him to score 25 touchdowns in Sylmar High's 10 games? 
</P>
<P>
Done. 
</P>
<P>
Want him to gain more than 1,700 yards rushing and receiving? 
</P>
<P>
Check. 
</P>
<P>
What about defense? Can this guy make 70 solo tackles from his strong 
safety-middle linebacker position? 
</P>
<P>
Got that one too. 
</P>
<P>
All right, all right. We'll get him eventually. How about daring him to throw a 
touchdown pass? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he's done that too. And he has run back kickoffs for winning touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Bet he can't leap tacklers in a single bound, eh? 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. It's been done. Casey, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior, has been filmed 
actually hurdling oncoming tacklers. He even did it against Poly last week when 
he rushed for 260 yards and scored six touchdowns in front of scouts from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the SC coach nearly dropped to one knee when he saw that one," Casey's 
coach, Jeff Engilman, said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the moves," Casey says, flashing his million-dollar smile. "One 
of the many." 
</P>
<P>
Ho-hum, huh, Jerome? 
</P>
<P>
Well, let's bet we get him here. He has to be a prima donna. Has to have an ego 
the size of the San Fernando Valley. Has to be a first-class jerk. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Charlie. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more likable, happy-go-lucky 
kid than Sylmar's 17-year-old Casey. On-field star, off-field puppy dog. 
</P>
<P>
So what do you call a guy like Casey? King of the hill, Jack-of-all-trades. 
</P>
<P>
"The ace man, if that's what you want to call it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, a trace of the ego, eh? 
</P>
<P>
"Nawwwwww," Casey says, wearing his ever-present grin. "I think of myself as a 
team player, man. I try to help out any way I can." 
</P>
<P>
Every high school team should be so lucky to have such a team player, one who 
may be chosen his league's offensive and defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, to dunk a basketball as a six-footer, long jump 22 feet and bench-press 425 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. 425 pounds? No way, Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
"See, that's something I should prove to all the writers," Casey says. "Let me 
start working out again, and you guys come out one day and see me." 
</P>
<P>
Still don't believe him? We're talking about someone who weighs 185 pounds and 
can run the 100-meter dash in 10.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a kid do it," says Engilman, who coached two City Section 
championship teams at Manual Arts. "And we really, really, really push weights. 
At Manual Arts, we had some studs. And they never did it. 
</P>
<P>
"But when Jerome did it, I had to go out and buy special shirts." 
</P>
<P>
Engilman generally rewards those who bench-press 300 pounds with T-shirts 
bearing the slogan: "Sylmar 300-pound club." Go to a Sylmar practice and ask 
Casey to lift up his jersey. Look at the T-shirt. It reads, "Sylmar 400-pound 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Want a good gauge of Casey's ebullient personality? Listen to him describe the 
day he broke the 400-pound barrier: 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the summer, during hell week. I was hyped. I mean, I was excited. My 
adrenaline was going and everything. That's why I think I did it, 'cause I was 
hyped up to do it. I shocked myself and everything." It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Casey is an animated speaker, and one has little problem realizing how he 
translates that energy to his running. When Casey runs, it generally takes 
quite a few hits -- or a load of humanity -- to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
"That's determination, man," he says. "I'm determined to get to the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Case(y) in point: Two weeks ago, Sylmar was putting forth a lackluster effort 
in a game against North Hollywood. The score was tied, 14-14, after a 
third-quarter Husky score. Engilman asked Casey to return the kickoff to give 
the team a lift. He did -- by going 80 yards for a touchdown and a 21-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, North Hollywood answered with another touchdown drive 
and a two-point conversion to take a 22-21 lead. Again, Engilman asked Casey to 
return the kickoff to give the team a lift. This time he went 85 yards yards 
for a touchdown and a 29-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he does (fire us up)," senior wide receiver Joe Vaughn said. "We weren't 
hyped up for the game, and his kickoff returns inspired us to go out and play 
defense and hold the lead." 
</P>
<P>
"What else can I ask?" Engilman asks, rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
Engilman did ask Casey to consider all his options last summer when the Sylmar 
star considered transferring to either San Fernando or Granada Hills. Casey was 
concerned about the quality of the Sylmar team, fearing that his participation 
on an inferior squad would hurt his visibility among college scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want him to go," Vaughn says. "If he was gonna go, I didn't know what 
I was gonna do." 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed all his options," Engilman says. "I said to him, 'We'll develop 
the offensive line. You'll get your yards.' And now he's having his best year. 
He's been the main show. He knew it would be tough and his resiliency shows. He 
must get hit five or six times before he goes down." 
</P>
<P>
Casey does not regret staying at Sylmar -- scouts from Washington State, 
Nebraska, USC and Colorado chart his progress -- and neither do the Spartans, 
who will enter tonight's 3-A Division playoffs with a 7-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
But Casey's senior season has not unfolded without a little controversy. Well, 
emphasize the little. Casey engaged in an amusing war of words with Reseda 
tailback Joe Tushnet, based on Tushnet's ardent postgame comments after the 
Regents stunned Sylmar, 20-6, on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
After that game, the Reseda squad jubilantly shouted "Jerome who?" while, 
Tushnet, who gained 200 yards to Casey's 77, hollered: "I was just proving a 
point. He ain't the best back around!" 
</P>
<P>
But two weeks later, after a victory over Grant in which Casey scored three 
touchdowns and threw for another, the Sylmar star greeted reporters thusly: 
"Tushnet who? Tushnet who? You tell him, pound for pound, inch for inch, I'm a 
better man and athlete than he'll ever be." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later about it, Casey smiles and says: "I just gave him something to chew 
on. Ohhhh, I didn't believe it when I read it. I said, 'what's with this guy?' 
I've never heard of him and all out of the blue he's just gonna come and say 
this madness. I thought it was bad sportsmanship totally. I would never do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The high-spirited Casey prefers to let his on-field performance speak for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a person who likes to have fun on the field. 'Cause that's what it's 
all about . . . We're not out there to try and kill one another. I'm just out 
there to have fun. That's what it's about. And doing what you like doing. 
That's what I'm all about. I just go out there, and be a good sport. 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"And do my thing."

MIRA COSTA SOUNDLY DEFEATS CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mira Costa High girls' volleyball team gave each member of the Chatsworth 
team a yellow carnation before Tuesday night's Division I first-round state 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mira Costa (25-0) gave Chatsworth a sound beating, as the Chancellors 
fell, 15-5, 15-1, 15-10, at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, the City Section 4-A runner-up to Palisades, ended its season 14-4. 
Mira Costa, the nation's No. 1 ranked team and the Southern Section 5-A 
champion, advanced to the second round, where it will meet Torrey Pines on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously are not at that level," Chatsworth Coach Steve Berk said. "But we 
had some nice plays and we got 10 points off them in the third game; it was a 
good way to get ready for next year." 
</P>
<P>
In the last game, Chatsworth took a 7-2 lead. Junior hitter Heather Gorman, who 
had five kills, teamed with Kelly Scott to block a Kristal Attwood spike, 
giving Chatsworth its fifth consecutive point and the five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
But then Mira Costa scored eight unanswered points, including three service 
aces by Cindy De Garceau, to take control. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth scored two more points in the game on Mira Costa errors, but it was 
not enough. 
</P>
<P>
The first two games took only 25 minutes to play. In the first game, Chatsworth 
only managed six sideouts. 
</P>
<P>
All-American setter Piper Hahn led Mira Costa with 24 assists. Attwood had 
eight kills.

S.D. SCHOOL DRESS CODES -- 'RELAXED' ABOUT COVERS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE M. SPEARNAK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent Times article explored an East Coast trend toward the use of uniforms 
in public schools. This article looks at school dress codes in San Diego County 
and a move to follow the East Coast lead. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code at La Jolla High School is simple, explains Vice Principal 
Cassandra Countryman. Students can wear almost anything as long as it is 
appropriate for school and doesn't disrupt the "learning environment." 
</P>
<P>
But what, exactly, does she consider disruptive? Nose rings, ripped jeans, 
spiked hair? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," said the no-nonsense administrator. "If it shows your 
(derriere), it's inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to high school dressing in the '80s, where students can wear ripped 
jeans, if certain parts of their anatomy don't show, pink hair, if nobody 
cares, and white pancake makeup that makes them look like devotees of Marcel 
Marceau. 
</P>
<P>
No longer must students worry about the restrictive dress rules that existed in 
the '60s and early '70s. Today's high school dress codes request decency and 
little more. "We have them cover their bottoms and their tops, and that's about 
it," said Joan Adler, vice principal at Mission Bay High. 
</P>
<P>
Today's dress codes are so relaxed that several students admitted they didn't 
even know rules existed. Perhaps that's a tribute to their desire to dress 
neatly and stylishly. Or it could be their ignorance. Either way, most are 
adamant in saying they like and appreciate the leniency. 
</P>
<P>
"The way you dress is really an important part of you," explained Oliver 
Andriesse, 16, of Crawford High School, who accessorizes his basically black 
outfit with an earring, a Mickey Mouse watch and hair gel. "The school already 
teaches you how to act and how to think. If they tell you what to wear, we 
might be wearing uniforms. We would be like a little army." 
</P>
<P>
Not every student believes the dress code should be as flexible as it is, 
including Lisa Gomez, 16, who wouldn't mind wearing a uniform to school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more convenient. You wouldn't have to take 10 minutes out in the morning 
to decide what to wear," said the Crawford High student. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are uniforms convenient, they can save students -- and their parents 
-- money. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Principal Lowell Billings at West View School in South Bay hopes to 
institute a voluntary uniform policy at his elementary school, where 25% of the 
students come from low-income families. The school district's Board of Trustees 
approved the plan in August, and parents are now reviewing it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing parents going broke trying to buy the latest tennis shoes and 
T-shirts for their kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is approved, students would be able to opt for the uniform. Because 
West View is a public school, uniforms cannot legally be required. Billings 
hopes to design an outfit pleasing enough that most of his 450 students would 
rather wear it than their own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Another South Bay school, Pence Elementary, has been chosen as a pilot school 
for a voluntary dress code, which may begin as soon as January. 
</P>
<P>
High school students are more likely to rebel at wearing a uniform. Robin Hunt, 
a freshman at Mission Bay, thinks students would complain at any suggestion of 
a more severe dress code. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people know how to dress and what's right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With all the freedom students have to bend such relaxed rules, surprisingly few 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get out of hand. Students don't take advantage of the dress code, 
because they can wear whatever they want," said Bashiri Cooper, a 16-year-old 
Crawford High student whose tastes run to shorts, T-shirts and some serious 
high-top tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I think our kids look very sharp," said Augie Bregante, vice 
principal at Crawford. A longtime educator, Bregante remembers when the rules 
were far from lenient -- when boys' hair had to be short but girls' skirts 
couldn't follow suit. "When I was teaching 25 years ago, boys couldn't wear 
their shirttails out. Today that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bregante spends more time worrying about whether his students might be 
wearing clothes emblazoned with gang insignia -- one type of clothing 
absolutely forbidden at Crawford and high schools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being asked to wear clothes that do not disrupt the learning 
environment, high school students throughout the county follow brief guidelines 
regarding dress. 
</P>
<P>
Most schools forbid T-shirts advertising alcohol, tobacco, drugs, sex or 
anything obscene. Students cannot expose obviously inappropriate areas of their 
torso. They are asked to dress "appropriately," however they may interpret 
that. The only absolute is that they must wear shoes -- a state law. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that may convey gang membership, from an earring to a colored bandanna 
in the pocket, is strictly verboten and taken seriously by school officials. 
April Reeves, a 17-year-old student council member at Mission Bay High, was 
called to the office once when she wrapped a bandanna around her ankle as part 
of an outfit. Administrators asked her to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Dress codes began changing in the late '60s, when students and their parents 
started filing lawsuits against restrictive rules, challenging rights to 
freedom of expression. Dress regulations fell away as quickly as students began 
winning those cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that in some cases, our dress code was an infringement on the 
rights of the students," said Al Cook, an assistant superintendent for San 
Diego city schools who was a vice principal in 1968. "For example, today it 
would be hard to justify why boys were not allowed to wear shorts. Back then, 
they could merely say it was unacceptable or not in good taste." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before students began challenging the rules in court. When a 
student at a San Diego high school was suspended for dying his hair green 
during the late '60s, then won a court challenge, dress codes began to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Today's students might notice a classmate with green hair, but they would 
hardly be as astonished as they were 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We always get some kids every year who dye their hair every color under the 
sun," said Mission Bay's Adler, who, like other administrators, barely bats an 
eyelash over such costumery. 
</P>
<P>
Following court challenges across the nation, schools began turning to the 
community and its residents to help them set dress standards. The relaxed code 
at Mission Bay High reflects the easygoing nature of Pacific Beach, Adler says. 
Students wear shorts more often than at other schools, along with lots of 
bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Lopez, a senior who commutes from Paradise Hills to attend advanced 
classes at Mission Bay High, doesn't care for the beachy look. Dressed in a 
black mini-skirt, cropped top and blazer, Emma said she would rather see 
students dress more conservatively, and in darker colors. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many shorts. I think it's kind of sad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Illicit T-shirts create the biggest dress code problem at the county's high 
schools. During the first week of classes at Poway High, Gary Price spotted a 
student wearing a shirt advertising Mr. Zog's Sex Wax. Luckily, the young 
administrator knew what the product was. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex Wax. It's a real wax. I use it on my surfboard. But we can't have that 
kind of thing around school. So we asked him to reverse his shirt," Price said. 
"Kids here are allowed their individuality to a point. But when it's 
interfering with the educational process, then we call the students out of the 
classroom and discuss it with them." 
</P>
<P>
Price said he has more trouble with Poway students who are tardy for class than 
he does with dress code violators. "For the most part, the kids at Poway dress 
fairly nicely. They're clean and they're well-groomed. But then, this is a 
fairly affluent area." 
</P>
<P>
Affluency seems to have little to do with whether students violate the dress 
rules. Although most Crawford High students don't have the money to buy their 
wardrobes at Nordstrom, students there looked as neat, albeit different, as 
those at Poway or Mission Beach High, a middle-income school. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators concede that one reason they continue to maintain a flexible 
dress code is to avoid court challenges, which crop up across the country from 
time to time. In 1987, a high school in Northern California rescinded its 
controversial ban on T-shirts and clothing advertising beer because it feared 
costly legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials also stress that students are more conservative today than 
during the '60s and less apt to challenge the rules. Although a dress code 
infraction today might consist of an obscene T-shirt, problems during the '60s 
were often more outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Hopper remembers working as a vice principal at Patrick Henry High when 
she was called to talk to a girl wearing an army overcoat with nothing 
underneath. When the girl's mother arrived to take her daughter home, the woman 
berated Hopper for not allowing her daughter to dress as she liked. 
</P>
<P>
That fashion idea would never win the approval of Kristie Gudith. Although the 
17-year-old readily acknowledges that she loves to wear skin-tight jeans, "the 
kind that cut the circulation off," with blouses and painted T-shirts, she 
wishes more students at Crawford High would dress up and wear the skirts, heels 
and jeans she favors. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks of Crawford as a poor school already. I think it would help 
the school's image," she said. And perhaps students' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids act in different ways depending on how they dress," said Mission Bay's 
Adler. "In education, things always seem to come full circle. . . . I see us 
moving into a more conservative era, with more attention to dress codes. As we 
learn more about what impacts behavior, we may pay more attention to dress."

HOLIDAY HOSTS APPRECIATE PRESENTS THAT HAVE PRESENCE ABOUT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JAPENGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some guests may tremble at the prospect of picking just the right holiday 
offering for that sophisticated host. But one recent visitor to the home of 
Colin Cowie, a Westside party designer and caterer extraordinaire, was not 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you told me that you love the apple tart from Michel Richard," the 
guest told Cowie, proffering the treat at his host's front door, "but I must 
apologize -- the maid took a big bite out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie, who was charmed by the flawed tart, tells the story to emphasize that, 
at holiday parties, it's your presence, not your gift, that counts. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to get together, not to wait in anticipation to see what 
people are going to bring you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that assurance -- and the equally comforting advice from prime 
party-goers and etiquette sages that, in most cases, it's fine to show up 
empty-handed -- it still holds that an invitation to dinner during the holidays 
will leave most people groping at the last minute for the proper token to tote. 
</P>
<P>
The age-old instinct -- to bring wine or flowers -- has come under scrutiny in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Ford, author of an etiquette book and a manners column for McCall's 
Magazine, said guests should never take flowers to a dinner party, although it 
is acceptable to send them later. Why? Because if presented with such a gift, 
"the hostess has to leave her guests and run and find a vase." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's is not the final word on this issue, as some other knowledgeable folk 
still prefer flowers to other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Scheips, whose holiday schedule sends him scrambling for a gift as many 
as five nights a week, says flowers make an evening of food and conversation 
less ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, you're gone, but the flowers still are there," said Scheips, 
organizer of Art L. A. '89, an international art fair at the Convention Center 
Dec. 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
As for wine, still one of the most popular dinner gifts, many in the know now 
urge against this offering because it may undercut or befuddle the host who 
already has the beverage selected for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, the naysayers are not going unchallenged. Ford, for instance, says 
it's fine to take wine, just don't expect the host to uncork it that evening. 
That way no one has to worry about the selection clashing with the meal. 
</P>
<P>
If the function is formal, it's better not to take a gift at all but to send 
something before or after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie's favorite pre-party gift is a box of Teusche Champagne truffles flown in 
from Europe once a week and available for $18-$72 at the Teuscher store in 
Beverly Hills. He calls the chocolates the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have the time to do it, I make a basket and put in Christmas mince pies 
and almonds," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
But, if he's rushed, Cowie might go with a tin of Williams-Sonoma Scottish 
shortbread (about $10), tied with a red or green ribbon. Party-goers en route 
to dinner engagements also breeze by the Williams-Sonoma stores around town for 
mustards, olive oils and Fini vinegar ($9 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Another Cowie suggestion is the popular champagne and caviar gift baskets from 
Wally's Liquor Store in West Los Angeles. They run anywhere from $50 to more 
than $500. 
</P>
<P>
But what is most endearing to hosts these days is not the guest who drops $500 
on caviar but one who bakes a bundt cake, glazes walnuts, or hand paints an 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, time is of the essence and what really is very special is if someone 
has taken time on a gift," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Ausman, chief of protocol for Los Angeles County, agreed, adding that 
the most cherished party offering these days is anything homemade. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of do-it-yourself ideas is Martha Stewart's new Christmas 
cookbook, she said. An item from Stewart's book Ausman recommends is the 
pomander, a scented orange made to be hung in closets or hallways during the 
holidays. You take an orange, stud it with cloves (adding the cloves is hard on 
the thumbs, Ausman said) then hang it up to dry and later roll it in cinnamon 
and other spices. 
</P>
<P>
Another inexpensive gift from Stewart's book is potpourri. Ausman said she 
saved all the flower petals from her daughter's wedding this year and now has 
lots of dried petals to stuff in potpourri pouches along with spices and 
scents. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Weiss, who attends many social functions in her dual roles as director of 
special events at the Music Center and president of the board of directors of 
the Downtown Women's Center, said a sure-fire gift is wrapping paper designed 
by artists. Some recipients find the paper so beautiful that they can't bear to 
use it as wrapping, she said.

CALCULATING CORRECT FOREIGN WORDS

<P>
Seiko Instruments' new, bilingual electronic language translators are due in 
December at electronic and department stores and specialty shops nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The devices make finding the correct word in French, Spanish or English as easy 
as uno, dos, three. 
</P>
<P>
There are four models of the pocket-sized translators, two English-French and 
two English-Spanish. They can translate from English to Spanish or French or 
vice versa, depending on the model. The 40,000-word units retail for $89.95; 
the 80,000-word devices will cost $119.95. 
</P>
<P>
The machines also operate as full-function calculators with memory and as 
currency exchangers. They use two lithium batteries and come with a carrying 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, the devices will be available at Adrays, Century 21 
Electronics and Sharper Image. To find stores that carry them in other areas, 
call Seiko Instruments' toll-free number, (800) 873-4568, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. Pacific Standard Time. 
</P>
<P>
Fray Check Helps When It's a Raw Deal 
</P>
<P>
One of the most versatile products on the market is Fray Check, a clear liquid 
sealant that prevents raw edges of fabric -- seams or hems, for example -- from 
raveling, strengthens thread that holds buttons, repairs burns on rugs, seals 
breaks in lace and stops runs in nylons. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by Dritz Corp. of Spartanburg, S.C., Fray Check comes in a 
3/4-ounce bottle and will not discolor or stain most fabrics, a company 
spokesman says. Still, it is wise to test it on an inconspicuous seam. Fine 
fabrics require a lighter application than do heavier ones. 
</P>
<P>
A treated fabric may be slightly stiff after drying but that disappears with 
washing. Fray Check withstands laundering or dry cleaning, Dritz says. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for Fray Check is $2.59; it can be found nationwide in 
department store notions sections or fabric and sewing stores. If you can't 
find it in your area, contact Dritz Corp. at (800) 845-4948. 
</P>
<P>
Quick 'n' Easy Water That's Pure, Portable 
</P>
<P>
Tired of carrying bottled water to your home or office? Consider Glacier Pure, 
a new portable water processing system that, its manufacturer says, turns tap 
water into purified drinking water an hour after it is refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
The system features a three-stage internal filtration and processing system in 
a plastic double-chamber jug. First, water goes through a filter that takes out 
rust, dirt or sediment. Then it passes through an activated carbon filter to 
remove colors, tastes, odors and chlorine. A third filter completes the cycle; 
after refrigeration the water is ready for use. 
</P>
<P>
The Glacier Pure processor costs between $9.99 and $14.99; replacement filters 
from $3.99 to $5.99 at major retailers nationwide. The filter should last for 
100 gallons or 60 days, reports a spokeswoman for Glacier Water Systems Inc. of 
Mount Prospect, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the system is available at Walgreen's, F. W. Woolworth, 
Target, Albertsons and Price Club. To find it in other areas, contact Glacier 
Pure Water Systems Inc., 550 Business Center Drive, the Kensington Center, 
Mount Prospect, Ill. 60056; phone, (312) 803-1150. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered Caribou Joins Plush Species 
</P>
<P>
Joining the World Wildlife Fund's family of stuffed plush animals of endangered 
species this year is the caribou, a North American deer on the endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
The caribou, a close relative to the reindeer, was added to the stuffed toy 
collection, which includes reproductions of snow leopards, tigers, whales, sea 
turtles, pandas and elephants. Each plush toy wears an official green and black 
World Wildlife Fund panda medallion and comes with a booklet about the real 
animal and its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The small stuffed animals (six to seven inches) retail for about $10; medium 
(12 inches), about $18-$30; large (24-36 inches), $35 to $70, and giant animals 
(two to three feet) are about $200. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based World Wildlife Fund, the largest conservation group 
working to help preserve wildlife in more than 110 countries, benefits from the 
sale of each stuffed animal. Its collection is carried nationwide in 
department, gift and toy stores. If you can't find the stuffed toys in your 
area, contact Applause Inc., the distributor, at (800) 777-6900. LYNN SIMROSS

SCREEN STYLE: PEACOCK WEAR FOR MEN

<P>
The Show: "thirtysomething," ABC, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The look: As hip as they are, pity the women characters. They're completely 
overshadowed, sartorially speaking, by the men with whom they share screen 
time. All the women seem to own are T-shirts and tank tops. Tank tops and 
T-shirts. So here we applaud the triumvirate of Elliot-Michael-Gary. But 
especially Elliot, pictured above. (You know, the bearded fellow with marital 
problems, played by Timothy Busfield.) He may wear the ugliest ties on 
television, but he's all peacock. 
</P>
<P>
Details that count: Let us call it Elliotware. Elliot has a weakness for 
neckties bearing hand-painted palm trees and other bizarre, grotesque 
configurations. His sport shirts are even worse. Typically busier than a TV 
test pattern, the one imprinted with pink roses over brown checks should be 
preserved in the Smithsonian. His sport jackets are flecked. The sum total 
could give you a headache. 
</P>
<P>
The costumer: Patrick Norris, who won an Emmy award for his work on the series 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The program: Michael's the straight arrow, the suit, as they say. This season, 
he seems snappier, more upscale. So what if he wears Armani suits and looks 
more like an executive at ABC than the Philadelphia advertising executive he 
plays on the show? Gary meanwhile, remains the quintessential preppy slob, 
partial to khakis, olive drabs, letterman jackets and bicycle riding caps. But 
Elliot is the coolest. As Norris puts it, Elliot "is my peacock." Busfield and 
Norris have an agreement. "I won't teach him how to act and he won't teach me 
how to costume." Of the ignominious rose-check shirt, Norris feigns no regret. 
"It had to be one of the riskiest things I've done on him. Pretty insane." 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: Oh yes, there definitely is one. Norris and partner Charles Winston 
hope to manufacture a line of menswear under the label Charlespatrick based on 
what they currently design for Elliot. (The other characters wear off-the-rack 
clothes from a variety of Los Angeles shops, including American Rag, Ice and 
Fred Segal.) As we said before, just call it Elliotware. BETTY GOODWIN

ORCHESTRA: PIANIST CECILE LICAD BROUGHT AN UNUSUAL PERCUSSIVE APPROACH TO 
CONCERTO AT SAN DIEGO CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S SEASON DEBUT.

<P>
Maestro Donald Barra and his San Diego Chamber Orchestra inaugurated their 
1989-90 season Monday night at Sherwood Auditorium with a largely Russian 
program that would have been an apt ornament to the recently completed Soviet 
arts festival. Glinka's quaint, nationalistic tone poem "Kamarinskaya," 
Kabalevsky's playful suite "The Comedians" and Tchaikovsky's frequently 
overlooked "Mozartiana Suite" provided unhackneyed, albeit affably lightweight, 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
The concert's anchor, however, was Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 14 in E-flat 
Major, K. 449, with guest soloist Cecile Licad. Local audiences may recall her 
impressive performance last season with the visiting Scottish Chamber 
Orchestra. Her energetic, assertive Mozart interpretation was a tribute to both 
her strong technique and even stronger personal music vision. Unlike Gustavo 
Romero's elegant and at times mystical approach -- he played two Mozart 
concertos in the same hall just three days earlier -- Licad's Mozart bristled 
with percussive attacks and a surprisingly brilliant timbre. Unfortunately, her 
zeal frequently pushed her well-polished runs ahead of the beat. 
</P>
<P>
Even Garrick Ohlsson, the strapping American pianist who opened the San Diego 
Symphony season with another Mozart piano concerto, rendered Mozart with 
graceful intimacy. But, if Licad's view of Classical style is not the current 
party line, the striking pianist from the Philippines made an arguable case 
without apology. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's accompaniment was clean and supportive, although not as 
authoritative as the soloist's execution. Barra had recruited some new string 
players, with favorable results in the orchestra's tone and discipline. 
Glinka's "Kamarinskaya" gamboled at a jaunty tempo, and the gregarious 
Kabalevsky suite featured well-turned solos from concertmaster Igor Gruppman, 
percussionist Patrick Pfiffner and clarinetist Frank Garcia.

A Screening Screening: A cinema complex in Southfield, Mich., has outlined 
plans to install metal detectors to keep people from bringing guns and other 
weapons to the movies. Officials at the AMC-Americana theater announced plans 
for detectors and other increased security measures following a shoot-out at 
the cinema Friday night during the premiere screening of Eddie Murphy's 
action-comedy "Harlem Nights." Shots were fired inside and out of the theater, 
wounding three men. Management has since pulled the movie from the cinema's 
marquee. DANIEL CERONE

Hey, It's a Living: New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, already signed up as a 
television commentator, is adding newspaper columnist to the growing list of 
job titles he'll assume when he leaves office in January. Koch will write a 
weekly column for the New York Post, the paper announced this week. "I will be 
even less inhibited as a columnist than I was as mayor," Koch promised. "The 
world will be my oyster." Koch, who will be succeeded by Democrat David 
Dinkins, has already agreed to teach at New York University and do regular 
commentaries for local television and radio stations. "Anyone who's ever 
covered Ed Koch would have been very surprised to see him pull a General 
(Douglas) MacArthur and fade away," said New York Post Editor Jerry Nachman.

The slightness of Tina Howe's "Coastal Disturbances" may come as a surprise to 
playgoers who have heard the raves from the East. Though it is a common failing 
of daily-newspaper critics to weave skeins of high-flown praise around some of 
the most slender stage fare, one expected a work of shimmering subtleties at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
But, as revealed by an ambitious, cleverly conceived and well-directed 
production at Rancho Santiago College, this Off-Broadway import comes across in 
its Orange County premiere as a pleasant, sometimes volatile, frequently 
whimsical play that -- if it were on television -- might be labeled a soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
It depicts a week on a private New England beach frequented by three women, two 
children and an elderly couple, all watched over by a strapping lifeguard. The 
disturbances of the title reflect their feelings, a kaleidoscope of moods as 
variable as the ocean breezes of late summer. Sudden gusts of emotion ruffle 
the surface of their mundane lives, exposing failures of the past and fragile 
hopes for the future. The present seems a brief and not altogether successful 
respite from both. 
</P>
<P>
Teeming with digressions, "Coastal Disturbances" revolves chiefly around a 
romance that blossoms between outdoorsy Leo Hart, the always solicitous 
lifeguard who perches above the sand dunes on his wooden platform, and artsy 
Holly Dancer, the neurasthenic photographer who has come to the beach for a few 
days to pull herself together. Holly, having been ignored by her lover back in 
New York and denied a show at his art gallery, says she's having a breakdown. 
It's unclear whether she's serious. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the play's texture is delicate and fragile, though not what you would 
call subtle. The production excels, in fact, on the flip side of subtle with an 
environmental setting that packs a double whammy: a silky blanket of 
fine-grained sand that reaches across the stage to suggest a landscape of 
dunes, and a beachside cafe called Geoff's Snack Shack, where the audience is 
seated for the show and served real beach food (hot dogs, soft drinks and ice 
cream). 
</P>
<P>
The dual setting has the effect of drawing us into the play and bringing us 
closer to the characters: Faith, a pregnant mother, doing a bit of 
lifeguard-ogling; Ariel, a divorcee with an unruly young son, talking of her 
dried-up reproductive organs; their careening kids, Winston and Miranda, who 
take a certain pleasure in aping the adults; Dr. Adams, a retired eye surgeon, 
scavenging for seashells; his wife, M.J., painting seascapes. 
</P>
<P>
Leo, a reassuring presence, is just as ready to help unfurl a beach umbrella as 
he is to administer first aid. No task is too small, no expectation too great. 
Even when it comes to large commitments like love, he seems rock solid. Holly, 
on the other hand, is flyaway as the sand on the beach. Self-absorbed and 
fearful, she is reluctant to get involved with him. But dependable Leo has an 
instinctive fix for that, too. He playfully buries her to the neck in the sand. 
The movement of his hands on her body works like an erotic massage. 
</P>
<P>
Arlo Gates Jr. and Colleen Dunn are both well cast in the leads. And they are 
nicely supported by the rest of the company: Ralph Richmond as Dr. Adam; 
Suzanne Chapman as M.J.; Fernanda Thomas as Faith; Cindy Hanks as Ariel; Jerome 
Shelton as Winston; and Karyn Stevens as Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
It is only in the second act, with the appearance of Holly's lover, Andre, that 
the play takes a particularly awkward turn. The character rings false on all 
levels, though he is clearly intended to be a phony, out-of-sync with Holly, 
the beach and everything that is natural, true and right. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is a walking cliche. It is hard not to snicker at his windy 
speech about his family's emigration from Antwerp and how he pulled himself up 
by his bootstraps and became an influential art connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
For another, Trapper Johnson's portrayal of Andre leaves much to be desired. We 
don't believe for a minute that he is Jewish, suave or worldly. His Frenchified 
accent sounds ridiculous. His double-breasted white suit and black shirt is 
anything but chic. And for all his claims, he doesn't give the least impression 
of being knowledgeable about art or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Holly buys this egregious impostor says as much about the play's 
weakness as it does about her own flaws. It's passable if we see through Andre 
and Holly doesn't, so long as we don't take her for an idiot. But what else can 
we conclude, given her decision at the end of the play? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how many times can Leo come to the rescue? Many more, we are given to 
believe. Will Leo take Manhattan? Tune in next time . . . 
</P>

PHOTOGRAPHY: EXHIBIT AT CYPRESS COLLEGE SHOWS HOW JACK BUTLER MIXES THE REAL 
WITH WHAT HE CALLS THE 'NON-REAL.'

Photographer Jack Butler deals with societal problems and family issues through 
his photographic sculptures and various wall pieces. 
</P>
<P>
But with Butler there is a contradiction. Photographs intrigue him, yet he 
rarely shoots photographs. His images largely are collected: from books, 
calendars, throw-away flyers, photographs, newspapers or any mass-produced 
image. If he sees something intriguing or that is potentially intriguing, he 
saves it. 
</P>
<P>
Seven images from Butler's current series, "The Trial," are on display at the 
Cypress College Photography Gallery until Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The large 38-by 49-inch photographs feature work from a 1960s murder trial in 
which Butler has masked the characters' faces and hands so they become 
ambiguous and strange. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the play between the two-dimensionality of the figures and the 
photographic reality of the clothing and the stuff around them," Butler said. 
"I like the jarring conflict between the real and the non-real in the 
photograph." The "Trial" started out in a small secondhand store where Butler 
found a box with hundreds of old photographs. He spent an afternoon looking 
them over to cull out 18 photos for his project. 
</P>
<P>
He thought the photographs didn't look real, but staged, like something you 
might see on television. 
</P>
<P>
He rephotographed the original press photos and isolated the primary characters 
of the courtroom setting. "Basically the treatment of the characters is 
essentially to neutralize them so they aren't individuals," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he cut out the figures from the rephotographed work and obliterated the 
faces and hands with white paper. Next he raised the cut-out figures and the 
titles off a dark background, lighting them so they cast a shadow for a 
three-dimensional look. Then he rephotographed and enlarged them. 
</P>
<P>
Butler first got interested in photography while studying art for advertising. 
He was more intrigued in what the images meant rather than using them in an 
advertising sense. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, 43, was born in Oswego, N.Y., and reared in Arizona. In 1960, he moved 
to Pasadena and later earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in art at Cal 
State Los Angeles. He also received an master of fine arts from UCLA. 
Currently, he teaches photography at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just teach photography as a medium," Butler said. "It's like a language, you 
teach someone a language and they can do a grocery list or poetry or scientific 
studies." 
</P>
<P>
It is the context into which photographed images are placed that has come to 
fascinate Butler most. 
</P>
<P>
"I became interested in (photographs') societal context," Butler said. "Each 
time it's placed in another context its meaning changes. Let's say you pick a 
snapshot image. If you see it in someone's photo album in their house it has a 
certain connotation about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took that same image and put it on the wall in the Museum of Modern Art 
it would have a different connotation. If you take the same photograph and use 
it on an editorial page of a newspaper it has a different connotation. 
</P>
<P>
"The meaning of a photograph is so dependent on its context. Its meaning 
changes as its audience or viewer sees it based on their own experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial," a series of black-and-white images by photographer Jack Butler, will 
be on display until Dec. 1 at the Cypress College Photo Gallery, in Technical 
Education Building 1, 9200 Valley View, Cypress. Hours: Monday through 
Thursday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to noon. Admission is free. For 
more information call: (714) 826-4511.

SUSPECT IN EMBEZZLEMENT ACTED QUICKLY, CHARGES SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
It took Louis Fowler less than five months to figure out how to get rich, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler had barely begun his job as an accountant for the State Water Resources 
Control Board when he set up a dummy water district and then transfered $4,400 
to himself, an affidavit filed by investigators asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he embezzled $5.1 million, investigators charged, in a simple 
scheme to siphon off state funds meant for the construction of sewage treatment 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The thefts, which took place from 1983 to 1985, might have gone unnoticed if 
not for a confidential tip to law enforcement officials last January that led 
to the arrests last weekend of Fowler, 35, and his former wife, Jill Baume, 26. 
</P>
<P>
Until his arrest, Fowler was best remembered by his former co-workers as a 
bodybuilder and "ladies' man" who liked to come to work in shorts and muscle 
shirts. They described him as low key and pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators say that Fowler was also a crook. They say he forged a wide 
variety of documents to create a fictitious agency known as the Sacramento 
Community Services District. He then doled out money to the "district" every 
few months in a pattern that resembled routine contract expenditures, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In his largest single transfer, investigators for the State Justice Department 
said Fowler shifted $1.3 million to the phony agency in October, 1983. After 
allegedly making a final transfer of $861,800 in March, 1985, Fowler quit his 
state job, telling one co-worker he was going into the video rental business. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look back, it does seem a little surprising that he would be quite so 
peacock-like in his demeanor," said Randy Kanouse, a water board employee who 
knew Fowler casually. "I guess he felt very confident in what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
The case has left many state officials red-faced and baffled as to why the 
theft went undetected for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
The official explanation offered by the water agency is that Fowler knew the 
state's accounting system so well that he was able to cover his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the water agency said the former accountant forged the signatures 
of his supervisors and set up legal-looking claims with the state controller's 
office, which eventually wrote out 15 checks totaling $5.1 million to Fowler's 
bogus operation over a period of more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, state Treasurer Thomas A. Hayes said he is so concerned by the 
breakdown in the state's system of checks and balances that he has asked Acting 
Auditor General Kurt R. Sjoberg to audit all of the state's bond funds over the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there was a breakdown in internal control at the water board," said 
Hayes, the official responsible for state bond sales. "I'd like the auditor 
general to make sure we don't have a bigger problem. I don't think we do, but I 
want to make sure." 
</P>
<P>
And Sjoberg said his auditors have already begun investigating why the water 
board's internal auditing system did not turn up the bogus payments. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler was picked up Saturday in Mesa, Ariz., where he had been living under 
the name of William David Rice, a dead man. Both Fowler and his former wife had 
access to the accounts where the money was transferred, Department of Justice 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Fowler allegedly walked away with the money, he has been living quietly 
in Mesa, where he operated a video rental store called Club Video. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Fowler's home after his arrest uncovered a sock filled with a dozen 
South African gold krugerrands, some Mexican and Canadian gold coins and $3,500 
in cash, police said. Authorities also found mounds of documents, military 
smoke flares, large firecrackers and unsophisticated plastic explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Where Did It Go? 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are uncertain what has happened to most of the money Fowler is 
accused of taking -- but they are eager to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Schmidt, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said a 
cursory reading of the documents found in the house indicated that Fowler had 
placed more than $5.1 million into a series of dummy corporations. 
Investigators are now focusing their attention in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is certainly no $5 million cash in the house," said Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who is being held on $6.85-million bail, has been charged with 17 
felony counts of grand theft and tax evasion. He is fighting extradition to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
At a Sacramento Municipal Court arraignment on Tuesday, Baume pleaded innocent 
to three charges of filing a false tax return and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ana Bravo charged that Baume received at least $140,000 in 
embezzled funds, including $40,000 in a 1986 divorce settlement and $80,000 
from Fowler to open a shop in Sacramento called Yogurt Obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Baume, who was married to Fowler for about a year and a half, told 
investigators when she was arrested that her ex-husband provided her with that 
money, according to Bravo. Baume also told investigators that Fowler gave her 
about six payments of $3,000 to $4,000 during the last two years when the 
yogurt shop needed cash, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew all along that the money was stolen," the prosecutor said of Baume. 
"We will offer no (plea bargain) deals in this case. We have enough evidence to 
convict both of them. We don't need her testimony against him." 
</P>
<P>
Baume, a blonde dressed in a gray sweat shirt and dark slacks, watched Judge 
Jane Ure closely throughout the hearing but showed no emotion. At one point in 
the arraignment, her mother, Susan Baume, shouted from the audience in defense 
of her daughter, but was told by the judge to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
In divorce papers filed by Fowler and Baume in 1986, they declared that they 
had "no community assets or liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler had worked for the state on and off since he was 21 -- including a 
10-month stint at the Department of Justice, which is now spearheading the 
investigation into his activities. 
</P>
<P>
From 1975 to 1978, Fowler worked as an accounting clerk at the Public Employees 
Retirement System, according to his personnel records at the water board. From 
there, he moved to the Department of Justice, where he was an accounting 
technician in the accounts payable section until early 1979. Between 1980 and 
1982, he was employed as an accounting specialist in the Employment Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Kati Corsaut, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, said investigators 
would begin reviewing his past jobs to see if there is evidence of embezzlement 
earlier in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The money investigators say was paid to Fowler was part of a $375-million sewer 
bond issue approved by voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
James Baetge, executive director of the water board, said the agency has 
undertaken 10 major audits since the money was stolen and none of them turned 
up the missing funds. The former accountant was helped by the length of time it 
takes for sewer and water projects to be built, normally a period of years, 
Baetge said. Usually, he added, there is not a final accounting until all the 
money has been spent from a particular bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This fellow found a way through the process of checks and balances that 
existed in 1983 and 1984. He was in just the right position to get it through," 
Baetge said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra A. Salazar, a spokeswoman for the board, said Fowler's accounting job 
put him in a position to both review contracts and handle payments. 
</P>
<P>
'Knew the Format' 
</P>
<P>
"He apparently was able to pull this off because he knew the system so well. He 
knew the format required for contracts, the proper format for invoices under 
the contracts, and the appropriate signatures required for payment under the 
contracts. So he dummied up the contract, and submitted the invoices and 
authorization for payment," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Edd Fong, a spokesman for state Controller Gray Davis, said the controller's 
office paid the claims submitted by Fowler because they appeared to be valid. 
He said responsibility for checking out the contracts rested with the water 
board. Fong said, "You have to operate on the premise, at least we do, that 
when you receive a claim signed and reviewed by three different people that one 
or more of those people took a look at it carefully and determined that they 
signed a valid claim." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said there currently are 55,000 contracts on file with his office. 
Hundreds of thousands of checks are written each year. In the case of the water 
board, Davis said the controller's office was presented with documents, signed 
under penalty of perjury, that the claim was valid. 
</P>
<P>
In Mesa, Fowler was living with Denise J. Petrovich, who owned the home where 
he was arrested, police said. Petrovich was cooperative with officers and, 
after Fowler's arrest, voluntarily agreed to open some of her safe deposit 
boxes for them, police spokesman Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-story house with a back yard pool and spa was decorated with expensive 
furniture and featured an elaborate video system, a tanning bed and a large 
safe. Behind the house was an 18-foot Bayliner ski boat believed to be 
Fowler's. 
</P>
<P>
But about a mile away from the house, a video shop Fowler had operated since 
early 1986 was closed and barren of everything except a stool, four large 
filled plastic bags and some plastic fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the quiet cul-de-sac where Fowler lived said Tuesday the house was 
visited by a variety of different women but he was a good neighbor. "I figured 
he had inherited money or made money," said Len Horn. "Girls came and went. He 
had a lot of girlfriends." 
</P>
<P>
Christy Strauch, another neighbor, said she also noticed a large number of cars 
at the house. "We all suspected he was a drug dealer," she said.

A sampling of the nation's leading Roman Catholic bishops indicates that most 
are distancing themselves from San Diego Bishop Leo T. Maher, who last week 
banned a Democratic assemblywoman from Communion for her openly pro-choice 
stance, saying they prefer to appeal to an official's conscience first. Several 
of the bishops said, however, they still may ultimately penalize Catholic 
politicians who blatantly oppose the church's teaching on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the action against San Diego Assemblywoman Lucy Killea appears to be 
an isolated response, the bishops still are faced with a two-pronged dilemma: 
How to consistently implement a strongly worded resolution they adopted two 
weeks ago calling for Catholic politicians to publicly adopt an anti-abortion 
stance while, at the same time, avoiding backlash from American voters who 
resent political "meddling" by church authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Maher's action may hurt, rather than help, the bishops' cause, 
and stiffen the resolve of pro-choice Catholic lawmakers to steer their own 
course independently of church counsel, according to some church leaders and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter sent to Killea last Wednesday, Maher accused the four-term 
legislator, who has a solidly pro-choice voting record, of being "an advocate 
of this most heinous crime" and banned her from receiving Communion -- the most 
sacred element of the Catholic Mass -- unless she recants. She said she would 
follow Maher's order, but would not change her position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Killea faces Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) in a special election 
Dec. 5 for a vacant Senate seat in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Other pro-choice Catholic politicians responded quickly to support Killea, 
saying they were concerned about the potential political fallout of Maher's 
action against her. 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled that the Catholic Church has entered into politics in this 
manner," declared State Sen. Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles). "What this action 
says to Catholics everywhere is that the church can dictate public policy by 
issuing orders to Catholic lawmakers." 
</P>
<P>
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo issued a statement saying Maher's denial of Communion 
to Killea raised "troubling questions." Cuomo asked whether the church would 
now impose sanctions on Catholic officials who differ with its teaching on such 
issues as the death penalty or distribution of contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said he did not think the flap would 
affect his campaign for governor in 1990. The Catholic Van de Kamp's strong 
pro-choice position "is well known," spokesman Duane Peterson said Tuesday. "He 
has discussed his views with (Los Angeles Archbishop) Roger Mahony. They 
disagree on the issue and it ends there." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson added that while Van de Kamp personally opposes abortion, "he believes 
it is not the place of government to make the choice for women." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Sly, a spokeswoman for the California Catholic Conference in Sacramento, 
said the state's bishops decided at a meeting last month in San Diego that the 
best strategy for swaying Catholic lawmakers to the church's abortion view was 
for each bishop to meet individually with legislators in their own dioceses 
rather than to impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might have interpreted Bishop Maher's actions as being too strong," she 
conceded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops themselves are not unmindful that the resolution they unanimously 
adopted at their national conference in Baltimore on Nov. 7 -- which urged all 
public officials, especially Catholics, to work to end legal abortions -- could 
backfire. 
</P>
<P>
Although that resolution declared that "no Catholic can responsibly take a 
'pro-choice' stand when the 'choice' in question" involves abortion, it did not 
mention sanctions. And when Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, outgoing 
conference president, was asked directly at a press conference in Baltimore 
whether he thought sanctions would be effective, he bluntly replied: 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think it would help us one bit to change America's thinking" about 
abortion. "It might even have an adverse effect," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, the newly elected chairman of the bishops' 
Committee for Pro-Life Activities, also downplayed the matter of sanctions, and 
Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin appeared reluctant to be drawn into 
discussion of the issue by the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it's not so much a question of expelling a dissident 
person as it is motivating that person to change his or her mind and heart," 
Bernardin said when pressed. He added, however, that the possibility of 
sanctions "needs further study." 
</P>
<P>
The Killea situation is so sensitive that few bishops would comment directly. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, who spoke eloquently in favor of the abortion resolution in Baltimore, 
said through his public affairs director that his position was best expressed 
in his June policy statement directed at Catholic officeholders. That 
statement, which does not mention sanctions, says legislators have "a positive 
moral obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, both Mahony and Bishop Norman F. McFarland of the Diocese of 
Orange have said they would impose sanctions against a Catholic politician 
supporting abortion rights -- but only if the lawmaker exhibited what Mahony 
called a "very flagrant" outspoken stand. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland added, however, that unless a Catholic public official "who actively 
promotes abortion" directly challenged him, he would not deny Communion to that 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
Father Ken Doyle, a media spokesman for the U.S. Catholic Conference, summed up 
the bishops' delicate position by saying, "A determination like this properly 
belongs to a bishop in his own diocese. There is no specific conference policy 
on the matter of sanctions for those Catholics who disagree publicly with the 
church's pro-life position." 
</P>
<P>
In the Archdiocese of Denver, for instance, where Mayor Federico Pena is a 
visible, openly pro-choice Catholic, neither Archbishop J. Francis Stafford nor 
Pena's parish priest, Father Marshall Gourley, plan any punitive actions, 
spokesmen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And John Walsh, communications director for Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston -- 
in whose church jurisdiction Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a pro-choice 
Catholic, resides -- said, "There is a good degree of latitude under canon 
(church) law in terms of discipline a bishop may take. Each bishop looks at his 
own circumstances and makes up his own mind." 
</P>
<P>
Law reportedly plans no sanctions against Kennedy, nor O'Connor against Cuomo. 
Representatives of both politicians said neither had received word from 
Catholic officials threatening action or pressing them to modify their abortion 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Yet O'Connor's auxiliary bishop, Austin Vaughan, said he hopes the nation's 300 
bishops take "some kind of collective action on this." Maher's disciplining of 
Killea, he said, "points to the significance of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan added in a telephone interview that he has publicly warned Catholic 
politicians "who push pro-choice views . . . they are running a serious risk of 
going to hell." 
</P>
<P>
Such differing views illustrate how difficult it will be for the Catholic 
bishops to come up with a consistent policy of dealing with the pro-choice 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
If what is meted out in San Diego goes unpunished in Denver, how are the 
nation's 300 bishops to speak with one voice on the issue they described in 
their statement as "an overriding concern" and the "fundamental human-rights 
issue" of the day? 
</P>
<P>
Maher intended his bold -- and, as yet, one-of-a-kind -- punishment to serve as 
an example to the faithful and a deterrent to "erring" Catholics politicians. 
But in doing so, he may have forced other bishops to be more cautious in the 
way they handle the abortion resolution. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Maher's action is likely to stir residual anti-Catholic 
sentiment among American voters, who, opinion polls show, deeply resent the 
intrusion of sectarian religious beliefs into politics. 
</P>
<P>
Even Father Robert J. McManus, the vicar for education in the Diocese of 
Providence, R.I., who thinks the church should consider excommunicating 
pro-choice Catholic politicians, advised the church hierarchy to move slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be extremely unfortunate," he wrote in America, the influential 
Catholic weekly published by the Jesuits, "to jeopardize the generally 
responsible political leadership of a Catholic public official or to reawaken 
inadvertently a latent, yet historically evident, prejudice that Catholics are 
not politically independent enough of their bishops' political agenda to govern 
in a pluralist society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have long opposed abortion as the 
unjustified taking of human life except in rare cases where the pregnant 
woman's life is jeopardized. But their latest policy statement, adopted this 
month, is the first since last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows 
individual states more latitude in restricting abortions. In their stepped-up 
campaign against pro-choice advocates, the bishops' resolution goes further 
than their earlier statements by calling for public officials, especially 
Catholics, to work to end legal abortions.

TALAMPULAN ISLAND, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 13 years old, Carlos Gallano already had seen friends drown -- or rupture 
their eardrums deep underwater. Others were slashed by propellers or attacked 
by sharks. 
</P>
<P>
His job was to swim all day, pounding a heavy rock on fragile coral reefs to 
drive fish into nets. At night, he'd fight for space with 300 others crammed on 
a filthy, fish-filled deck. His pay for 10 months at sea: $75. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardship was too much," he said. "We were like slaves. 
</P>
<P>
"So I escaped. When we got to land, I hid in the cemetery. They tried to hunt 
me down. They said I would be beaten if I was caught." 
</P>
<P>
Gallano's tale is the sad story of muro-ami. Originating in Japan, it is a 
uniquely dangerous and destructive form of Philippine reef fishing that critics 
say combines modern slavery with ecological disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Reefs are crucial to marine life, and scientists say the 7,107 Philippine 
islands boast the richest reefs in the world. They are home to an estimated 
2,000 species of fish and 500 of coral. Australia's Great Barrier Reef, by 
contrast, has 1,500 species of fish and 400 of coral. 
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine reefs are also the most damaged. Together with muro-ami, 
fishermen using the poison sodium cyanide, homemade explosives and dynamite 
have helped to destroy an estimated 70% of the reefs, a University of the 
Philippines study found. Only 6% were still pristine. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance to coastal people is extreme," warned John McManus, a marine 
biologist at the university's Marine Science Institute. "Our number one concern 
is feeding hungry coastal villagers. And coral reefs are a major source of food 
and income for them." 
</P>
<P>
Muro-ami is also a source of food and income. Operators say 5,000 teen-agers 
and young men currently work off 28 muro-ami boats. Each year they harvest more 
than 10,000 metric tons of fish from shallow waters in the Sulu and South China 
seas. 
</P>
<P>
Each ship sends scores of swimmers into the sea. Advancing along the reef, the 
swimmers jerk long "scare-lines" tied to chains or rocks across the coral. 
Others, wearing only goggles, hold their breath and dive as much as 100 feet 
deep to anchor the nets. As the cordon of swimmers close in, the free-divers go 
back down to free the net and haul the catch. 
</P>
<P>
The results, investigators say, are huge profits, mile after mile of shattered 
coral and dozens of injuries and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine 200 or 300 people pounding a coral reef to drive the fish," said 
Rogelio Gonzales, a local fisherman and village official. "It destroys 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
And the risks include deafness, nitrogen narcosis and shark attacks -- 24 have 
been recorded. Some lose fingers or toes, smashed between the mother ship and 
the outriggers. Others suffer typhoid fever or dysentery from the ship's 
cramped squalor, where sanitation is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
But the divers face the most danger. 
</P>
<P>
"No scuba diver in his right mind will go anywhere near a net," said McManus, 
who has studied muro-ami. "And these kids have to swim under the net, 90 to 110 
feet underwater, holding their breath. If anything happens, they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Many apparently are buried on a wind-swept beach here. Most graves are marked 
by broken coral and simple driftwood crosses, faded in the tropical sun. 
Typhoons have washed some graves away, or left some of the crosses tilting 
crazily under tangled coconut palms. 
</P>
<P>
"All the pescadores (fishermen) are buried here," said Marietta Baltazar, 
councilwoman for the only village, Panlaitan. "They do not allow burial at sea. 
They are religious people." 
</P>
<P>
The village of 5,000 nestles against a long beach below steep green hills. 
Muro-ami crews are easy to spot, since the sun and sea have bleached their 
black hair red. And they have turned the sleepy island 180 miles southwest of 
Manila, in the Calamian group of islands, into a mini-boomtown, with bustling 
shops, cockfights and bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Our island is a commercial center now because of muro-ami," boasted Cirilo G. 
Caco, the barrio captain. "Without it, people here would starve." 
</P>
<P>
That is the dilemma for the government. In 1986, the Department of Agriculture 
tried to ban muro-ami. But officials approved delays while alternative 
employment schemes were studied. Muro-ami operators, in turn, agreed to use 
less destructive equipment and stop hiring minors. 
</P>
<P>
But in May, investigators found at least 10 young boys working aboard the Dona 
Aurea-B, a muro-ami ship with 293 fishermen and crew working a reef near here. 
Government divers found that the swimmers had damaged soft underwater polyps 
using illegal scare-lines with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as terrible as before," said Malcolm Sarmiento Jr., general manager of 
the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority, who led the raid. "It was like 
a bulldozer underwater." 
</P>
<P>
A Senate committee has held hearings on a permanent ban, but opposition is 
strong. One reason is that the head of the House fisheries subcommittee, Rep. 
Crisologo Abines, comes from a family that jointly runs the multimillion-dollar 
muro-ami monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
The Abines company, the ABS Fish Trading Corp., arranges for the fishermen and 
divers and provides them nets and boats. The mother ships come from Frabal 
Fishing Corp., owned by Manila businessman Francisco Dee. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that ABS and Frabal receive 80% of the profits, while the 
fishermen and divers split the rest after nets, food and operating expenses are 
deducted. Since their families borrow money and shop in company-owned stores, 
many fishermen return in debt after 10 months at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the reason these are called the slave ships of the Philippines," McManus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most fishermen come from three rural villages in southern Cebu, a large island 
about 250 miles to the southeast. It is Rep. Abines' district, and his family 
runs local politics, as well as a bank, stores and buses. More than half the 
population depends on muro-ami, and roadside welcome signs say, "We love 
Muro-ami!" 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone does. Cebu's governor, Emilio Osmena, blames muro-ami for 
perpetuating "the most impoverished, illiterate and disadvantaged district" in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy children from families," Osmena charged. "The reason they prefer 
children is they eat less, take up less room and cause less trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"It's child labor, if not slavery," he added. "Hundreds already have died." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the Cebu villages, Raymundo Erauda, head teacher in the small Alo 
Elementary School, agreed. "There are no benefits to muro-ami," he said, 
shaking his head. "One of my nephews died. He drowned. He was only 12 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
Apolonio Abines Jr., chairman of the family company, heatedly denied the 
charges of deaths and slavery. Few, if any, have died, he said. Coral is not 
damaged by current muro-ami operations, he insisted, and all fishermen must be 
over 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we imposed the 18-year-old limit, the boys and parents are crying," he 
added. "They don't have any livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Emiliano Abines, mayor of Oslob, the largest of three villages 
where the muro-ami recruiting is done, also denied any undue injuries from 
fishing method. "No fisherman became deaf from diving," he said. "The deafness 
comes from an inborn sickness in Oslob, not from diving." 
</P>
<P>
And his sister, Encarnacion Go, mayor of nearby Santander, blamed politics for 
the criticism. The fishermen enjoy their work, she said. "You can give them 
diving equipment," she added. "They don't want to use it." 
</P>
<P>
But former fisherman Oscar Laurenciala painted a very different picture. Now 
28, he says he barely knew how to swim when he was hired for a muro-ami boat in 
the South China Sea in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us did not know how to swim," he said in Busuanga, near Talampulan. 
"There were many of us who almost drowned." 
</P>
<P>
The 300 swimmers and divers usually worked from sunrise to 
</P>
<P>
sunset. They worked reefs up to eight times a day, jiggling long lines hung 
with rocks and plastic streamers to scare fish into huge nets. 
</P>
<P>
When he complained that he couldn't swim, "as punishment, we'd have to stand 
under the sun," Laurenciala said. And when he lost a scare-line in the waves, 
"I was beaten by a paddle on the head." 
</P>
<P>
One friend was speared in the neck by a swordfish. And others had fingers and 
toes crushed by the moving boats. "A lot got hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On board, they slept crowded between racks of drying fish, in fishing-net 
hammocks hung three deep. They ate corn grits and salted "trash fish," cooked 
on the open deck. They drank unboiled water and washed in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Often sick, he was docked a full day's wages if he missed even one drive across 
the reef. He was also charged for his food, medicine, plus his share of the 
nets, outriggers and fishing gear. After ten months work, he was paid about 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
"I was misled," he said. "I was told the money was big and the work was easy." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he decided to quit and return to Cebu, a 40-hour boat ride away. "We 
were told we'd be sent home free of charge," he said. "But we've been stranded 
here. How can I go home?"

GAGE QUITS AS TOP BRADLEY AIDE IN MAJOR SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR and GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major City Hall shake-up, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage is leaving his position 
as Tom Bradley's chief of staff and top political aide for a job with a 
developer, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Gage's departure, effective Dec. 1, will end a roller-coaster stint in the 
mayor's office that spanned the best to the worst days of Bradley's political 
career. He helped engineer Bradley's political revitalization two years ago, 
only to be plunged into the center of an ongoing conflict-of-interest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden move will trigger a significant retooling of Bradley's staff at a 
time when the mayor is under continuing federal investigation and his political 
standing is at an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall sources said Gage, 44, will be replaced by Mark D. Fabiani, the 
mayor's 32-year-old staff lawyer and speech writer, who only recently was 
looking to leave the troubled Bradley Administration for a private sector job 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is scheduled to announce Gage's departure and Fabiani's appointment at 
a press conference today, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor is also expected to disclose the retirement of Deputy Mayor Grace 
Davis, a longtime Bradley liaison to the Latino community who has been at odds 
with Gage. Davis will be replaced by Diane M. Pasillas, executive director of 
the Latin Business Assn. and a recent Bradley appointee to the Board of Airport 
Commissioners, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said his departure after 2 1/2 years in the mayor's office was both 
voluntary and friendly. He said he believes that he was leaving behind a "a 
staff that is stronger than the one that was here when I arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Gage said he chose to speak in advance of today's announcement in the hope that 
his departure would not be portrayed as detrimental to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Tom Bradley," Gage said in an interview. "I watched him at a time that 
would have sunk smaller men -- and he held his head high." 
</P>
<P>
A former assemblyman from Napa and an outdoor adventurer, Gage will become 
president and chief executive officer of the San Fernando Valley home-building 
company of Theodore Stein, one of the most aggressive pro-development members 
of the Los Angeles Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
By leaving now, Gage may avoid pending ethics reforms submitted Monday that 
seek to bar ex-city officials from appearing before local agencies for a period 
of one year. 
</P>
<P>
But Gage said the proposed ethics limits would not be an issue because Stein, 
as a member of the Planning Commission, already falls under the city's 
conflict-of-interest code. Any project involving Stein's company automatically 
is sent to a group of council members acting as the Board of Referred Powers, 
Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the only guy in the city I can work for and not create a conflict of 
interest," Gage added. "I am not going to be lobbying for him either, not in my 
life. . . . I can live under the ethics code for the rest of my life, and it 
will not affect me." 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who has served for 15 months on the Planning Commission and is its vice 
president, said he hired Gage to manage his firm's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not hired in any way, shape or form because of any contacts he has with 
the city of Los Angeles," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Too Tempting Offer 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Gage has repeatedly denied to his staff and reporters that he 
was job-hunting or had any intention of leaving. But, he said in the interview, 
one published report of his denials brought an offer from Stein earlier this 
month that was too tempting to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani will move up in the mayor's office at a time when associates report 
that he had expressed reservations about the lingering investigation of the 
mayor and how it could possibly hurt his own career. But one source in the 
mayor's office said that whatever doubts may have existed did not prevent 
Fabiani from taking an even more visible and challenging position. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Gage has had a stormy relationship with some members of the mayor's 
staff and the media as he tried to keep together an office that suffered from 
the fallout of investigations of Bradley's personal finances and his conduct in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
A large, rough-hewn man, Gage has had a reputation over the years as easy-going 
and garrulous. But as scandal enveloped the Bradley Administration, he grew 
bitter and combative. Gage even took the extreme step of withholding news 
releases from the now-defunct Herald Examiner for what he perceived as the 
newspaper's unfair coverage of the mayor, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is under investigation by a federal grand jury for his business ties 
with eight banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage firms. Among the 
areas under scrutiny in the wide-ranging probe are possible insider stock 
trading and violations of federal law specifically aimed at political 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The federal probe is broader than the recently concluded investigation by the 
city attorney's office, which found insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley 
on conflict-of-interest charges. In his report, City Atty. James K. Hahn 
sharply criticized Bradley's indifference to ethical concerns and filed a civil 
lawsuit against the mayor over errors and omissions in his financial disclosure 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Gage has frequently skipped from job to job but without the 
controversy that surrounded his tenure at City Hall. In addition to his two 
terms as a member of the Legislature, Gage was a top strategist in the 1980 
presidential campaign of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and managed the 1982 
campaign of Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Bradley's 1985 reelection. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint with Beverly Hills investor Albert Gersten, Gage joined Bradley 
at City Hall in 1987. He is credited with almost immediately injecting new 
energy into the mayor's office and with helping scare off major Bradley 
opponents in April's mayoral election. 
</P>
<P>
Gage's new boss, Stein, has an estimated $30 million in annual sales of luxury 
homes and commercial buildings. Stein said he considers himself a centrist on 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowner activists contend quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are complaining about him," said Mary Ann Geyer, president of 
the La Tuna Community Awareness Assn. "I am hearing it constantly. They say 
that Ted Stein is taking a very pro-development stand on their cases."

HELM WOULD HAVE DISLIKED FUNERAL FUSS, MOURNERS SAY

As Buck Helm was buried in a small mountain cemetery Tuesday, friends eulogized 
the longshoreman as a kindhearted man who would have thought the attention to 
his death was overblown. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral in this town of 3,500 people in the Trinity Alps, his son, Marc, 
said Helm, who survived for 28 days after his dramatic rescue from freeway 
earthquake rubble in Oakland last month, "lived with nothing, so his children 
could have everything." 
</P>
<P>
Marc, 22, tearfully told how his father wanted his children to stay in 
Weaverville rather than "live in the violence of the city." Helm, 58, a member 
of the longshoreman's union, supported his family by working on weekdays as a 
clerk for various shipping companies at the Port of Oakland -- "and never once 
complained about the commute," Marc said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud of him," his former wife, Lorene, said, speaking briefly and 
emotionally at his funeral. The service lasted only a few minutes, and the 
family drove to a cemetery 30 miles away where Helm was buried next to his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
His funeral attracted about 100 friends and family members, plus more than 20 
reporters. Some locals, like Dale Larson, attended simply because Helm's rescue 
after 90 hours in the rubble of the fallen double-deck Nimitz Freeway structure 
struck a chord. 
</P>
<P>
Larson had only crossed paths with Helm, but felt a kinship with him. A few 
years ago, Larson was badly injured when a car hit him. He felt the warmth of 
Weaverville when 150 people showed up to donate blood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we were teased," Larson said of Helm's death. "It's like you lose 
something, then get it back, and then it is taken again. It was cruel, very 
cruel to his family." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because Helm spent much of his time in the Bay Area, he was not well 
known in Weaverville, an old gold mining town now known for its proximity to 
the prime steelhead trout waters of the Trinity River. Some people who knew of 
Helm said the burly, 240-pound man had a reputation for being a hard drinker 
who could be overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Tennyson saw Helm's "tender, loving, soft side." His daughter played 
with Helm's youngest child, Desiree, 12, and Tennyson recalled that "there was 
a sparkle in his eye when he was with kids." 
</P>
<P>
"The community is not trying to philosophize about his death. Other people can 
do that," said Tennyson, who is pastor at the Weaverville Church of the 
Nazarene, and brought his daughter to the funeral. "We just rejoiced at his 
rescue, and we are saddened by his death." 
</P>
<P>
The locals had found cause to cheer when they learned that one of their own had 
miraculously been pulled from the freeway. "This one's for you," a sign at the 
New York saloon had read. A local dance band, High Mountain Express, had 
written an ode to Helm, as a symbol that there's a "hero on every corner." 
Students at Weaverville Elementary School, the school that Desiree attends, 
raised $1,200 for earthquake relief, partly from the proceeds of weekly ice 
cream sales. 
</P>
<P>
School Ties 
</P>
<P>
Helm once spent his state income tax refund to buy ice cream for students at 
the school. He also helped tend a planter box in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of shows his character. His heart was in the right place," said Dan 
Goularte, acting principal and superintendent of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who knew him said Helm would not have wanted such a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he would have thought it was that big a deal. He would have 
thought it was overdone," said Nancy Pitz, owner of the Sawmill, a bar he 
frequented. 
</P>
<P>
Helm lived in a customized van when he was in the Bay Area, a trip of about 250 
miles that he made once a week. He had been driving a Chevrolet Sprint on Oct. 
17, when the earthquake hit. Helm remained trapped, his seat belt on, in the 
front seat for 90 hours before he was found and pulled free. 
</P>
<P>
His chief physician, Dr. Tom McDonald, had been hopeful that Helm would 
survive. But McDonald said a final infection caused sepsis, or blood poisoning, 
and that apparently placed too much strain on Helm's already diseased heart. 
Helm was the 42nd victim of the collapsed freeway, and was the 67th death 
attributed to the earthquake.

TOP LAWMEN MEET TO MAP A DRUG WAR; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: RESORT ATMOSPHERE BELIES BUSINESSLIKE ATTITUDE OF STATE, FEDERAL AND 
MILITARY OFFICIALS WHO DISCUSS STRATEGY AT TWO-DAY CONFERENCE.

The conventioneers came from as far away as Zapata County, Tex., 170 strong. 
They tended to wear cowboy boots and colorful summer shirts, and steered clear 
of the swimming pool and golf courses. They had come not for sunshine, but to 
huddle in private rooms and plot a war. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-day conference that ended Tuesday, top law enforcement officials from 
throughout the Sun Belt, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and 
his counterparts from Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial 
counties, met with ranking state, federal and military authorities to map 
strategy over how best to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States 
from south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first war I've planned in a fancy hotel, but . . . this is one war 
we aim to win," said a Texas Ranger, who was dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was organized by Block and the California National Guard, 
was described as significant by its participants because it marked the first 
time that so many government combatants in the drug war actually met to share 
experiences, information and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Springs meeting followed pledges in September by President Bush and 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to commit the military to the drug war. It was 
particularly gratifying for Block, who has criticized the federal government's 
level of support for local authorities fighting the illegal drug trade from 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real beginning," Block said moments after standing up during an 
opening conference session to praise the presence of Michael Wermuth, a deputy 
assistant defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Bush Administration proposed military participation in the drug 
fight, the burden of the Pentagon's involvement has fallen not on full-time 
regular troops but on part-time National Guard units in each state 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the gathering was upbeat as veteran drug fighters from inner-city 
Los Angeles swapped business cards with reservists from the New Mexico National 
Guard. The attendees were conspicuous in the resort setting with their 
uniformly short haircuts and pale complexions. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the business was kept secret. The meeting's organizers refused to say 
what was discussed in so-called "breakout meetings" that were closed to news 
reporters. Nor would they say when the new coordinated drug war would commence. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody tells you everything in a war," said one grizzled federal agent from 
New Mexico, who like the other conventioneers wore a name tag but asked that 
his identity not be published. "Let the drug lords find out when we put them 
behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
One ranking official of the U.S. Customs Service, while declining to discuss 
specifics in the closed-door sessions, said civilian authorities seemed 
interested in determining how best they can use military equipment and 
personnel. Of particular interest was how military intelligence can be used. 
</P>
<P>
"If we merged intelligence from several sources, including the military, just 
think how much more effective we can be in making seizures and arrests," the 
customs official said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the optimism of those in attendance, it seemed evident that this new 
war may have some rocky moments. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Herbert Temple, who heads the National Guard Bureau in Washington, 
went out of his way to tell the civilian officials that the reserve military 
units were not the ultimate players in the government's commitment to fight 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in charge of the war on drugs," he said. "You are. Our job is to 
help you win it." 
</P>
<P>
Temple also said he was hesitant to commit reservists to certain tasks, such as 
searching cargo containers for illegal drugs, since that is not a "military 
duty these folks were trained to do." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would consult with civilian authorities on how best to deploy Guard 
units. 
</P>
<P>
California Gov. George Deukmejian addressed the group at its closing luncheon 
at the Radisson Palm Springs Resort Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"While there are some pessimists who want to run up the white flag and 
surrender, there is no question in my mind that this defeatist attitude is dead 
wrong," Deukmejian said. "The health, safety and quality of our society depends 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a long, difficult, arduous fight ahead of us. But let me say, it is 
worth it."

3 APPELLATE JUDGES PICKED AS SUPREME COURT CANDIDATES; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: THE GOVERNOR'S SELECTIONS FOR AN IMPENDING VACANCY ARE ALL DESCRIBED 
AS MODERATE TO CONSERVATIVE. HE SAYS HE WILL ALSO CONSIDER CANDIDATES EVALUATED 
BY THE STATE BAR FOR PAST OPENINGS.

Gov. George Deukmejian, acting quickly to fill an impending vacancy on the 
state Supreme Court, on Tuesday named three appeal court judges to be among the 
candidates to succeed Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, who is retiring at the end of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he will submit the names of Appellate Justices Carl West 
Anderson, 54, of the San Francisco area; Armand Arabian, 54, of Los Angeles, 
and Ronald M. George, 49, of Los Angeles to a special panel of the State Bar 
for a non-binding evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
After a review by the Bar -- a process that may take up to 90 days -- the 
governor will select his nominee for the Supreme Court. That choice, in turn, 
will be subject to confirmation by the state Judicial Appointments Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in a two-page statement, said also that he is considering for the 
current vacancy "other jurists who have previously been evaluated" by the State 
Bar for a position on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
That list would include Appellate Justices Patricia D. Benke, 40, of San Diego; 
H. Walter Croskey, 56, of Los Angeles, and Fred H. Marler, 57, of Sacramento. 
All three were considered for the post vacated by retiring Justice John A. 
Arguelles that was filled earlier this year by Appellate Justice Joyce L. 
Kennard of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, the governor looked to established and experienced members of 
the judiciary as potential nominees. All are regarded as moderate to 
conservative in their judicial philosophies. They are thus not likely to alter 
the current balance of a high court that is generally seen as tough on crime, 
sympathetic to business and reluctant to blaze new judicial trails -- all three 
hallmarks in sharp contrast to previous high courts that had been dominated by 
liberals for decades. The three named Tuesday are also all former prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Deukmejian has filled six vacancies on the state high court. Five of 
his appointees -- including Kaufman, Kennard, Arguelles and Justices Edward A. 
Panelli and David N. Eagleson -- were on the state Court of Appeal. The sixth 
-- and the governor's first appointment -- was Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, 
his former law partner and a one-time federal district judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor once again is looking for a track record on the bench so he knows 
what he's getting," said Santa Clara University School of Law Dean Gerald F. 
Uelmen, a close analyst of the court. "He's looking this time obviously for 
some younger justices -- someone who hopefully has a little more stamina. He's 
looking for an appointment that will last." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's action came only four days after Kaufman, 60, announced his 
retirement from the judiciary as of Jan. 31, after serving less than three 
years on the Supreme Court. Earlier this year, Arguelles stepped down at age 62 
after serving only two years on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
In both instances, the retiring jurists cited personal considerations -- such 
as wanting to spend more time with their families. And both had completed 
sufficient service on the judiciary to qualify for enhanced pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Other jurists the governor has considered in the past, but who now are not 
considered among likely candidates for the high court, include Appellate 
Justices Hollis Best of Fresno and Lynn Compton of Los Angeles; now-retired 
Appellate Justices Gordon Cologne of San Diego and James Scott of San 
Francisco, and Pamela Ann Rymer of Los Angeles, now on the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Following are brief portraits of the three appellate justices named Tuesday by 
the governor: 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a resident of Piedmont, was appointed to the state Court of Appeal by 
Deukmejian in March, 1984. From 1975 to 1984, he served as a Superior Court 
judge in Alameda County -- a position to which he was named by then-Gov. Ronald 
Reagan and subsequently twice elected by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Anderson served as a deputy district attorney and was a lobbyist 
for the California District Attorneys, the California Peace Officers and the 
California State Sheriffs Assns. 
</P>
<P>
In October of 1988, while participating by special assignment in a case before 
the state Supreme Court, Anderson rendered a vigorous dissent when the court 
ruled 6 to 1 that a religious organization can be sued for employing "coercive 
persuasion" or "brainwashing" to entice unknowing recruits into joining a 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson warned against a court treading into a "theological thicket" and said 
the ruling was a "bad legal policy . . . that unnecessarily projects the court 
into the arena of divining the truth or falsity of religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
In another high-court case in which he participated, Anderson joined with the 
6-1 majority in July, 1988, in ruling that a defendant convicted of murder 
during commission of a felony could be sentenced to death even if he could not 
be prosecuted for the underlying crime. 
</P>
<P>
On the Court of Appeal, Anderson in November, 1984, wrote one of the first 
opinions in the state concluding that under Proposition 8, the anti-crime 
initiative passed by the voters two years earlier, California courts must 
follow the less-restrictive rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court in the 
determining the admissibility of improperly obtained evidence against criminal 
defendants. The state high court itself reached the same conclusion in another 
case decided later. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian, a resident of Tarzana and a friend of the governor, was named to the 
Court of Appeal by Deukmejian in 1983 after serving as a Municipal and Superior 
Court judge in Los Angeles as an appointee of Reagan. Before that, Arabian was 
an attorney in private practice for nine years and served two years as a deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
As a Superior Court judge, Arabian took a precedent-setting action during a 
rape trial by refusing to follow a requirement that judges instruct juries to 
view the victim's testimony with caution. Arabian described the instruction as 
demeaning and arbitrary. Two years later, the state Supreme Court agreed, 
striking down the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
On the Court of Appeal, Arabian concurred when the court last August upheld a 
provision of Proposition 73 banning off-year political contributions to state 
lawmakers -- a ruling, now pending before the high court, that significantly 
tightened restrictions on campaign fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian wrote an opinion in May, 1987, upholding the state's interest in 
preserving the integrity of the family and denying an unmarried man the right 
to visit a child he claimed he fathered. 
</P>
<P>
George, who resides in Los Angeles, was named to the Court of Appeal in 1987 by 
Deukmejian after previous service for four years as a Superior Court judge -- 
as an appointee of then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- and five years on the 
Municipal Court. Before that, he served as a deputy attorney general, assigned 
to the criminal division of the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
While in the attorney general's office, George successfully defended the 
prosecution and conviction of Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. As a Superior Court judge, he presided over the "Hillside Strangler" 
case of Angelo Buono Jr., who in a two-year trial was convicted of the slayings 
of nine women and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
George is a former president of the California Judges Assn. and is serving as 
head of a special task force of the state Judicial Council that is studying 
ways to reform the often time-consuming task of questioning prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
On the Court of Appeal, George in 1988 dissented from a novel 2-1 ruling in 
which the court held that a patient retained the right to share in the profit 
from commercial products made from his blood and tissue. George argued that 
extracted blood and tissue should not be considered a patient's property and 
that even if it was, the patient in this case had abandoned any claim to it. 
The case is pending before the state Supreme Court.

STRONGER CONTROL BY BEIJING URGED TO HELP ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
CHINA: THE PARTY CHIEF DEMANDS THAT REGIONAL AUTHORITIES OBEY THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in a major speech published 
Tuesday, declared that centralized control must be strengthened to solve 
China's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"At present, the central authorities must concentrate power and financial and 
material resources in the optimum way (and) must stress the importance of the 
state plan; only thus can we stabilize the whole economic situation," Jiang 
said. The speech, delivered Nov. 9 at a plenary session of the party's Central 
Committee, was released Tuesday by the official New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang delivered the speech immediately after being named by the 175-member 
Central Committee to head the party's military commission, replacing senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping in that powerful post. Deng, 85, who remains the dominant 
figure in Chinese politics, has made it clear that he wants Jiang to be his 
successor as paramount leader. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, 63, became party general secretary in late June, replacing the reformist 
Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted for opposing the use of martial-law troops to 
suppress pro-democracy student protests. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech, although representing collective views of the top leadership, 
also marked an opportunity for him to build his own authority as leader both of 
the party and army. He sought to do this with a mixture of modesty and 
toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"I said at the previous plenary session (in late June) that I was not fully 
prepared when I was elected general secretary of the Central Committee," Jiang 
said. "This time, I am not fully prepared either. I have no experience in 
military work, and I feel my abilities fall far short of what the position 
demands. But, since the party has assigned the work to me, I must make every 
effort to learn about military affairs and familiarize myself as soon as 
possible with the armed forces and carry out my duty conscientiously and 
actively." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang -- whose ability to impose his will on top army leaders is questioned by 
many observers -- went on to stress that the armed forces must obey the 
Communist Party, declaring: "Our army is the people's army led by the party." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Deng by his given name in a familiar and affectionate show of respect, 
Jiang also made reference to the continued political importance of the senior 
leader. Deng's support is the key factor boosting Jiang's power. 
</P>
<P>
"The health and longevity of Comrade Xiaoping is of great significance to the 
smooth development of the work of the party and the state," Jiang said. 
</P>
<P>
In tougher language, he demanded "the strengthening of party discipline." 
</P>
<P>
"It is our party's consistent rule that individual party members are 
subordinate to the party organization, the minority is subordinate to the 
majority, the lower party organizations are subordinate to the higher party 
organizations and all the party members and organizations are subordinate to 
the Central Committee," he said. "This is the basic organizational discipline 
that all party members must observe." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang demanded that regional authorities obey central government orders aimed 
at stabilizing China's economic situation. China is in the midst of an economic 
austerity program aimed at controlling inflation by cooling down what until 
recently was an overheated economy. 
</P>
<P>
"When anything has been decided by the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, all localities and departments should do their best to make it a 
success," Jiang said. "They can neither fall short of the requirements nor 
simply go their own way." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang offered few specifics on economic policy but stressed that China requires 
steady, balanced development "without violent ups and downs."

TOP BONN DIPLOMAT GIVES BUSH A PIECE OF THE WALL

West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, at the White House for a 
preview of the Malta summit, gave President Bush a brick from the Berlin Wall 
on Tuesday as a symbol of the growing strength of democracy in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the President and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Genscher said he had been assured that the United States will continue to 
support the wave of reform sweeping across Poland, Hungary and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of the West that the reform policy in the Eastern 
European states . . . may be carried out successfully and without any hindrance 
from our side," he said. He added that if the West tries to take advantage of 
the changes, it may undermine the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a brief appearance before reporters in the Oval Office, said he would 
treasure the piece of the Berlin Wall, which was broken away earlier this month 
after the East German authorities relaxed their once-Draconian travel 
regulations. During his trip to Hungary last summer, the President was given a 
piece of barbed wire from the now-dismantled Hungary-Austria border fence. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher declared, "The wall now is open, and the German Democratic Republic is 
on the way, really, to becoming a democratic republic." 
</P>
<P>
Turning directly to Bush, he said: "I would like to express, Mr. President, our 
great gratitude for the support, the help and the firmness of the American 
nation in the past decades -- in good times, but also in difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the focus of Bush's meeting 
with Genscher was on next month's Malta meeting between Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Genscher hailed the changes that have taken place in 
East Germany and sought to reassure those who fear West Germany's growing 
economic and political power. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans in (East Germany) have shown such a high amount of dignity, and of 
soberness, and of responsibility," he said. "We think that this commitment by 
all Germans to freedom and democracy is an enrichment for the whole of Europe. 
. . . Freedom and democracy have never been a threat to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Almost forgotten in the euphoria of Eastern European reform was the controversy 
over proposed modernization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
short-range nuclear missile force. Bonn objects to the project because most of 
the missiles would be stationed on West German soil, positioned to hit targets 
in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia or Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxed tensions in the area have increased speculation that the weapons 
will not be built. However, Genscher deflected questions on the issue, saying 
that NATO has agreed to make a final decision in 1992 and that there is no need 
to talk about the matter before then.

E. GERMANY VOWS '91 FREE ELECTIONS;

<TEXT>
<P>
East German leaders have assured the West German government that free elections 
will be held within two years, a senior emissary from Bonn reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
West German official Rudolf Seiters, after holding talks with East German 
leader Egon Krenz and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, said he was told that the 
elections could be held by the spring of 1991. Until a few weeks ago, such free 
elections would have been considered inconceivable in the former hard-line 
Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters, who also was preparing for a visit to East Germany before the end of 
the year by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, declared: "I do not think an 
election date before the summer of 1990 would be realistic." But he said 
elections could come within months after that. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government has made free elections a central condition for the 
massive economic aid that Bonn is eventually expected to extend to the 
faltering East German economy. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Modrow also said East Germany would crack down on the contraband 
trade that has sprung up since the border with West Germany was opened Nov. 9. 
At a factory in East Berlin, Modrow told workers the government will announce 
steps today to stop the speculation in goods and currency since the frontier 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the artificial currency rate in East Germany, East or West Germans 
can buy subsidized goods with cheap marks in East Berlin -- thereby creating 
shortages and sending up the price. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow admitted such regulations would be difficult, declaring: "Unpopular 
measures will have to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "The GDR (East Germany) must not become a nation of speculators. I 
cannot understand how many citizens are simply throwing away money they worked 
hard for." 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is expected to include border checks on people moving currency in 
one direction and goods in the other. But with the frontier in a state of chaos 
since it was suddenly opened, few formal customs stations are still in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow was backed up by Protestant Bishop Gottfried Forck, who urged West 
Germany on Tuesday to impose customs and exchanges on its side of the frontier 
to discourage smuggling. The West Germans have never set up controls with East 
Germany, on the grounds that the separation of two Germanys was artificial and 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the (West German) government for help to protect East Germany from 
bleeding to death financially and economically," Forck said after meeting 
Seiters. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said he would make a return trip to East Berlin in about two weeks and 
repeated that Bonn is prepared to give East Germany massive help -- once it was 
convinced that political and economic reforms would be irreversibly introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters also agreed that some kind of currency reform is necessary between the 
two Germanys because the East mark is artificially pegged at a 1-to-1 level, 
while it is only worth one-tenth to one-twentieth of the West mark on the free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, East Germans can get their welcome money of 100 marks (about $54), 
exchange it on the black market for 1,000 East marks, buy subsidized goods in 
East Germany and take the purchases back to West Germany to sell at a handsome 
profit. And they can repeat the process, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, too, members of East Germany's leading opposition group, New Forum, 
said the country needs time to organize itself for free elections. Scientist 
Sebastian Pflugbeil said most founding members would prefer that free elections 
be held later, rather than sooner. 
</P>
<P>
He said the emerging democratic opposition groups are having trouble organizing 
themselves into effective political parties -- particularly when competing 
against the huge Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The New Forum leader said his group as yet has only limited access to printing 
presses for newspapers and information sheets needed in free elections. 
Further, he said, because most members have full-time jobs, they can only work 
in their spare time to prepare for free elections.

A body found near a Peruvian jungle town has been tentatively identified as 
that of a missing American journalist, Todd Smith. Smith, 28, a reporter for 
Florida's Tampa Tribune newspaper, was last seen Friday as he left for the 
airport outside Uchiza, 245 miles northeast of Lima. He had been researching 
stories on drug traffickers and leftist rebels. Managing Editor Lawrence 
McConnell said in Tampa that "we have confirmed . . . that the body has been 
tentatively identified as that of Todd Smith." Uchiza is in the heart of the 
coca-growing Upper Huallaga Valley, and both drug-trafficking gangs and Maoist 
guerrillas operate in the region.

Former President Ronald Reagan postponed a visit Tuesday to Loyola Marymount 
University, where students and others indicated they would protest his 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan gave as an official reason his sympathy with the Jesuit community, which 
is mourning the killing of six priests in El Salvador last week. 
</P>
<P>
Several people called the Jesuit-operated university to protest Reagan's visit, 
according to David Herbst, a student and chairman of the speakers program. Some 
blamed Reagan's policies in El Salvador for contributing to the slayings last 
Thursday, he said.

Dozens of enraged Israelis blocked a street with garbage cans and burning 
bushes to protest the death of a 7-year-old Jewish girl struck by a garbage 
truck driven by an Arab city employee. "Death to the Arabs!" the rioters 
shouted in the working-class Shmuel Hanavi district. Police Chief Arye Bibi 
told reporters: "The driver indeed was an Arab, but it had nothing to do with 
the accident. The driver was arrested and his interrogation raised no 
possibility at all that he did it for political reasons." The driver's name was 
not given.

LT. GOV. MCCARTHY URGES END TO SALVADOR AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the civil war in El Salvador took a dramatic twist Tuesday, opponents of the 
Central American nation's government stepped up their activity in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, during a news conference with actor Ed Asner and a 
coalition of labor leaders and clergy, called for a boycott of Salvadoran 
coffee and a suspension of all U.S. aid to the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We should use California's power in the House and Senate to end the 
million-dollar-a-day military aid to the government of El Salvador," McCarthy 
said. "The time has passed when we should allow American guns to murder 
innocents." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a spirited rally in front of the Salvadoran Consulate in 
Westlake, about 200 protesters sang chants in Spanish linking the Salvadoran 
government to the killing of six Jesuit priests last week. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also set up a symbolic "people's consulate" to protest what 
they called the "inaction and apathy" of the Salvadoran consul general in Los 
Angeles. The consul general, Jose Mauricio Angulo, a member of the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, has made statements denying government 
involvement in the murders of the priests. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to denounce the consul for trying to maintain this campaign of 
disinformation," said Sara Martinez of the Coordinator of Salvadoran 
Committees, which organized the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that many of the 350,000 Salvadorans living in Los Angeles -- the 
largest Salvadoran community outside El Salvador -- have lost contact with 
their relatives in their homeland since the fighting intensified last week. She 
was critical of the consulate for failing to provide information to local 
residents about their missing relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We are suffering, like them, the bombings and the assassinations," Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Angulo attacked the demonstrators, most of whom were Salvadorans, 
as "very unpatriotic people, most of them brainwashed. . . . They've been here 
too long. They don't know the reality of El Salvador any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles protest was peaceful. But at a San Francisco demonstration, 
involving about 300 rowdy protesters, police officers made about 140 arrests 
and escorted government workers into the Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration at the Los Angeles consulate was only the latest in at least 
a dozen similar protests held throughout the Southland since the rebel 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front began its offensive in San Salvador 
last week.

Icy wind blasted down trees and power lines from the Great Lakes to North 
Carolina and whipped more than a foot of snow into squalls that stopped drivers 
cold in northern New England. Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines 
burned out of control in Virginia. The weather was blamed for seven deaths. The 
wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm that crossed New York and New 
England on Monday. The National Weather Service posted blizzard warnings for 
New Hampshire and most of Maine, where snow accumulations of up to 15 inches 
were expected.

The Georgia Supreme Court ruled that a 33-year-old quadriplegic has a 
constitutional right to withdraw from the breathing apparatus that has kept him 
alive for four years. The court said in a unanimous opinion that Larry McAfee's 
right to discontinue the treatment falls under privacy rights guaranteed by the 
state and federal constitutions. McAfee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in 
a 1985 motorcycle accident that left him a quadriplegic and dependent upon a 
ventilator to breathe. McAfee has said he plans to shut off his ventilator 
after the holiday season.

PEACE OFFICERS UNIT BACKS S.F. DIST. ATTY. FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 34,000-member Peace Officers Research Assn. of California Tuesday endorsed 
San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, the state's main union of police officers, said Smith has the 
record on fighting crime and other issues important to its membership, 
including support of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"From the street officers' perspective, Arlo Smith, we feel, is the best 
candidate for attorney general," said association President Larry Malmberg. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is battling Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for the Democratic 
nomination for the state post. Sacramento lawyer Dan Lungren is so far 
unopposed as the Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
One association member, who asked not to be identified, was critical of Reiner, 
charging that he "plea bargains away all our hard work" once cases go to court. 
</P>
<P>
A recent California Poll showed that Smith -- who also has been endorsed by the 
National Organization for Women -- gained 10 points between July and October, 
with the number of Democrats preferring Smith jumping from 13% to 23%. In the 
same survey, Reiner's support by Democrats jumped from 33% in July to 36% in 
October.

Walter A. Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause for 13 years, 
announced in Sacramento that he will resign as head of the public interest

commissioner. Zelman, 45, of Los Angeles, said he will not accept campaign 
contributions from the insurance industry or from law firms specializing in 
personal injury cases. He also challenged his Democratic opponents to agree to 
a voluntary spending limit of $750,000 for the primary. "You can't be an 
independent consumer advocate with $100,000 from the trial lawyers in your 
pocket," Zelman said. But the longtime proponent of spending limits and public 
financing of campaigns said he will not limit his own spending unless other 
candidates agree to follow suit.

SETTING OF DATE FOR MALIBU CITYHOOD ELECTION DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major blow to Malibu cityhood supporters, the county Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday put off for an unspecified time setting an election date for 
residents to vote on whether they want the seaside community to become a city. 
</P>
<P>
Furious Malibu residents, who have long accused the supervisors of holding the 
incorporation effort hostage to the county's plans for a sewer system in their 
community, jeered, hissed and refused to leave the room for several minutes 
after the decision. 
</P>
<P>
A Malibu citizens group announced that it will file a lawsuit to force the 
supervisors to set an election unless the supervisors change their minds and do 
so by late December. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to take legal action. Make no mistake about it," said Walt Keller, 
co-chairman of the 1,000-strong Malibu Committee for Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the supervisors have 60 days from when they began hearing the matter 
(Oct. 19) to set an election date. Until Tuesday, it had appeared likely that 
an election would be held in April. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to delay scheduling the election was 4 to 1, with Supervisor Ed 
Edelman dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the county have suggested that the state law governing the time 
limit for setting elections is "directional, and not mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on Tuesday the county's top public works official urged the 
supervisors to delay scheduling an election until the county receives 
assurances from the California Coastal Commission that it will approve the 
necessary permits allowing work on the sewer system to begin. 
</P>
<P>
County Public Works Director Thomas A. Tidemanson said the supervisors should 
delay the matter until "at least mid- to late April." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters, many of whom have long opposed the county's sewer plans as 
a recipe for widespread development, see incorporation as their best chance to 
wrest control of the sewer system from the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a point in time when one has to say that the interest of people in 
cityhood is as important as the county getting the sewers," Edelman said. 
"These people have been before us over and over, and I can't in good conscience 
deny them their right to vote on the matter." 
</P>
<P>
But other supervisors expressed a different view. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Pete Schabarum and Deane Dana, whose district includes Malibu, 
blamed the Coastal Commission for causing the delay, chiding the panel for 
approving a regional sewer plan for Malibu that was substantially smaller than 
county officials wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The commission last week approved a plan that cuts by half the capacity of the 
system proposed by the county to serve commercial users and also trims the 
capacity for residential use. Opponents of the county's plans say the action 
will result in a sewer system 25% to 40% smaller than what the county had 
insisted upon. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach along Pacific Coast Highway and nearly one mile inland. 
About 20,000 people reside within the proposed city's borders, including 8,300 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
In approving a bid by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood, the Local Agency 
Formation Commission in May stipulated that the county be able to retain 
control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials, fearing that a newly elected Malibu government would 
mount a legal challenge to that provision, want to make sure that a sewer they 
consider adequate is under way before Malibu residents vote on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to delay the election, the supervisors voted to ask both the 
chairman and executive director of the Coastal Commission to appear before them 
next week in pursuit of a compromise that could enable them to go ahead and set 
the election date. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials were not optimistic about the chances for compromise, and 
some supervisors expressed doubt that the Coastal Commission officials would 
even agree to appear. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Murdock, an attorney for the Malibu Township Council, called the delay 
"absolutely outrageous," and said the invitation was "an attempt (by the 
supervisors) to shift the blame for their own failings to the Coastal 
Commission."

CONVENTION CENTER TO THROW PUBLIC PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Think of it as moving into an almost completed new house. You can use the 
bathrooms and the living room, but forget the kitchen and the outdoor patio. 
Now picture more than 100,000 people dropping in for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
That's akin to what the people at the San Diego Convention Center are faced 
with as they prepare to formally open the new $160-million facility Friday 
morning, the first day of what's billed as a weekend-long "Community 
Celebration" ending late Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The center may be rough around the edges, but workers will be toiling around 
the clock to finish and polish what they can (cleaning, hammering and carpet 
laying were going full-bore Tuesday) for grand-opening ceremonies starting at 
11 a.m. Friday. The center will be open from noon until 9 p.m. Friday, 10 
a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the San Diego Convention Center is an event that has been long 
awaited by many people," said James Granby, president of the Convention Center 
Corp. "It's only fitting that the citizens of this community be the first to 
enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
The first event at the center actually took place Tuesday night, at a party for 
700 put on by the San Diego Unified Port District, the agency paying for the 
center's construction. The food was trucked in, though, as it will be when the 
first paying guests arrive, because the center's huge kitchen will not be ready 
for another month. Also waiting for completion next month is the 
107,000-square-foot floor under the center's distinctive Teflon-coated tent 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
Other than those areas, though, most of the center will be open for inspection 
by the public, and, with the exception of food sales, just about everything 
else, from admission to the entertainment, will be free. If center officials 
are correct and more than 100,000 people show up over the three days, parking 
could present a problem. A series of outlying parking lots serviced by free 
shuttle buses have been reserved. 
</P>
<P>
The first 100,000 people who show up will be given a free color poster of the 
center, donated by Union Bank, and the Convention Center Corp. will pass out 
another 200,000 commemorative buttons, as well as balloons. Convention center 
officials estimate that as many as 160,000 people will attend the opening, but 
they concede that is only a guess. 
</P>
<P>
The 254,000-square-foot main floor of the center will contain about 1,000 
display booths, given over to nonprofit groups and government agencies. Also on 
display will be military equipment such as an armored personnel carrier landing 
craft, a helicopter and plane, fire trucks, classic cars and the city's new 
50-foot portable jail. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment, ranging from an Irish tenor to African dancers, will be held 
throughout the three days inside the center and in the outdoor amphitheater 
facing the bay. Fireworks shows are set for 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is not totally done, but we're going to put on the best program 
we can," said Convention Center Corp. spokeswoman Donna Alm. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's civic leaders are expected at the opening ceremonies outside 
the front of the center on Harbor Drive, and the King Committee for Justice is 
expected to picket, protesting that the center was not named after the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader. The King issue sparked a 
political debate that ended when the Board of Port Commissioners voted against 
the name change last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The committee wants a woman, a Latino and a black appointed to the Board of 
Port Commissioners, which is now made up of seven white male appointees, as 
well as more jobs and contracts for minorities at the Port District.

BENTLEY FACING A CHANGED RACE AGAINST KILLEA; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BISHOP'S ACTION HAS LEFT GOP CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN ADRIFT IN A SEA OF 
MEDIA ATTENTION GIVEN HER RIVAL. BUT BENTLEY STAYS HER COURSE IN THE NORMALLY 
REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One week ago, GOP Assemblywoman Carol Bentley was sailing comfortably along in 
her special state Senate campaign -- a race that, while undeniably a tough one 
against a veteran campaigner, still was widely viewed as hers to lose in the 
heavily Republican 39th District. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in the words of her consultant, David Lewis: "The Lord struck." 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, Bentley has watched with a mixture of amazement, confusion 
and chagrin as her opponent, Democratic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, became a 
national media star after San Diego Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher's decision to 
deny her Communion because of her pro-choice stand on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the freshman legislator from El Cajon has been transformed from 
Carol Bentley, front-runner, to Carol Bentley, the other candidate in that 
campaign with the flap between Lucy Killea and the bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see your opponent's picture on Page 1 every day, and she's on the TV 
news every night for a week at this stage in a campaign . . . it is a little 
unsettling," Bentley conceded. "But I'm also the kind of person who rolls with 
things. I try to look at what's happening and put it in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Bentley has doggedly stuck to her original plan in the special 
Dec. 5 race -- chipping away at Killea's superior name recognition by building 
up her own, emphasizing the candidates' partisan differences in a district 
where that distinction clearly benefits her, and trying to paint the four-term 
Democrat as a liberal with close ties to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
While Killea spent Monday in New York City making nationwide television 
appearances on "CBS This Morning" and the Phil Donahue show, Bentley gave five 
speeches throughout the sprawling district, which covers most of eastern San 
Diego County, stretching from Ocean Beach to Imperial County and reaching north 
to the Escondido city line and Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
And, though she sounds a bit as if she is trying to convince herself, Bentley 
-- who, citing schedule conflicts, declined a request to appear on the Donahue 
show with Killea -- argues that her time Monday was better spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to people who are going to vote Dec. 5," Bentley said. 
"Personally, I don't care about my nationwide name ID -- I care about what it 
is in the 39th District. I'm not sure what it really does for Lucy. If she were 
an unknown, I think it would have been much more important for her." 
</P>
<P>
No one realizes better than Bentley, however, that Maher's action -- viewed 
alternately as deserved punishment of one who flaunted Catholic orthodoxy 
through her pro-choice TV ads and as an unwelcome church intrusion in politics 
-- has dramatically altered the dynamics of the race for the seat that 
Republican Larry Stirling vacated last month to accept a Municipal Court 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Although the consensus among political leaders is that the episode has 
significantly enhanced Killea's prospects, many also caution against 
interpreting Maher's sanction as a politically mortal blow to Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with uncertainty over precisely how the Maher-Killea dispute will 
affect the race's outcome, the district's daunting 49%-38% Republican 
registration edge dictates against dismissing Bentley under any circumstances 
before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, notwithstanding the nationwide furor touched off by Maher and the 
ensuing extensive, sympathetic news coverage that Killea received, the single 
most salient feature of the campaign may well be that, as Bentley put it 
succinctly: "This is still a Republican district, and I'm the Republican 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is Bentley's hope -- a statistical comfort that she clung to as 
she saw the campaign knocked off its axis, all the while knowing that there was 
very little she could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, when a closely contested political campaign ends, the candidates can 
reflect back upon it and, with the benefit of hindsight, identify the 
strategically shrewd moves or missteps that shaped the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
In the 39th District race, however, both candidates concede that Maher's 
sanction against Killea introduced a potent outside force that sent the 
campaign careening off in wildly unpredictable directions largely beyond the 
control of its two principals. 
</P>
<P>
"The bishop certainly did take the campaign out of our hands," Bentley said. 
</P>
<P>
"You find yourself reacting to events more than controlling them," consultant 
Lewis added. "It's not so much a feeling of helplessness as it is seeing things 
go on in a campaign that you can't control, which is a situation no political 
consultant would want." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis acknowledges some frustration, however, over Killea's extended stay in 
the media spotlight -- and, more specifically, to the way in which most recent 
news stories seemed to mention Bentley almost as an afterthought. Still, he 
understands why the events of the past week have eclipsed his own candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"This really is Lucy's ball to play -- it's between her and the bishop," Lewis 
explained. "We're pretty much on the sidelines until it plays itself out, which 
I think it probably will do over the Thanksgiving weekend." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief pause, Lewis chuckled wryly and added: "Of course, even as I tell 
you that now, I know that CBS News is already planning to relive it all next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the interpretation of choice within the Bentley campaign is that, 
after all is said and done, Maher's action could have only a limited impact on 
the race. Under that theory, most voters are more interested in issues such as 
drugs, crime and education than abortion, and will judge the candidates, not on 
one issue -- even one as critical as abortion -- but rather on the basis of 
overall philosophical compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
A corollary to that argument is that most people already have an opinion on 
abortion, and are unlikely to change positions because of the recent 
controversy. Finally, Bentley's backers contend that the debate has enabled her 
to better explain her own position, which is one of opposition to abortion 
except in cases of rape, incest or in which the mother's life is endangered. 
Unlike President Bush, Bentley supports public funding for abortions under 
those limited circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley sees one other potential up side in Killea's new-found celebrity -- 
elimination of any complacency that might have existed among her own 
supporters. Just as the controversy has drawn dollars and support to Killea, it 
has begun having the same effect on Bentley's campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, a lot of people felt this was such a strong Republican district that I 
probably didn't need their help," Bentley said. "After the last week, I'm not 
worried about anyone still feeling that way." 
</P>
<P>
Any mishandling by Killea's campaign of the strategic opportunities and 
challenges created by Maher's action also could undermine whatever benefits 
have accrued to her over the past week. Not wanting to be perceived as overly 
eager to capitalize on the event, Killea's aides have carefully and effectively 
managed their response to date. 
</P>
<P>
However, if they slip, there is no doubt that Lewis and his partner, Jim 
Johnston -- well known for their mastery of political hardball -- would be 
quick to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any misstep where they go over the line, we'll be waiting for them 
on the other side," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
During the race's closing two weeks, Bentley hopes to refocus voters' attention 
on the candidates' partisan and philosophical differences, and that the Maher 
controversy comes to be seen as "simply one of several factors" in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
However, even Bentley acknowledges that the key question may well concern which 
side's partisans have been more motivated by the events of the past week. And 
that is one question, she concedes, that may answer itself regardless of what 
she does. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I think what's happened is unfair? Not really," Bentley said. "If disaster 
strikes, I may feel that way on Dec. 6. But, for now, I just think that, while 
there's always something unique about every campaign, this one has been 
absolutely incredible."

UNION VOTE BY CEMETERY WORKERS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: PANEL RULES AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE, WHICH CLAIMED THAT 
THE WORKERS HAD BEEN INTIMIDATED BY ORGANIZERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Organized labor won a small but bitter struggle against the normally 
sympathetic Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Los Angeles on Tuesday when a 
three-member panel upheld the results of an election in which 128 archdiocese 
cemetery workers narrowly voted for union representation. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, whose members were selected by the archdiocese and the Amalgamated 
Clothing and Textile Workers Union, ruled 2 to 1 in favor of February's vote in 
which cemetery workers voted 66 to 62 to join the union. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has been watched closely because Archbishop Roger M. Mahony -- for 
decades a supporter of the labor movement on issues such as unionization of 
farm workers and raising the state's minimum wage -- had lobbied hard against 
unionization of the largely Latino work force at 10 cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Mahony spoke personally to many of the workers, arguing that 
unionization was not necessary because improvements in working conditions had 
been made. After the vote, the archbishop accused textile union organizers of 
using "confrontational methods" and said some cemetery workers had been 
threatened and intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony maintained that, despite his stand, he remains a labor sympathizer. But 
relationships between the archdiocese and local labor leaders grew strained. 
Last summer Mahony decided that he would not address the annual Labor Day 
breakfast of the Catholic Labor Institute, breaking with years of tradition. 
</P>
<P>
At the breakfast labor leaders declined to read a written statement submitted 
by Mahony in which he said "no one has benefited from this time of tension" and 
hoped for "the restoration of that unique friendship between us." 
</P>
<P>
The union election was conducted under the auspices of the state Mediation and 
Conciliation Service with an agreement that if the results were disputed, they 
would be resolved by a three-member "agreement committee" headed by Fred 
Alvarez, a San Francisco attorney who often represents management in labor 
relations matters. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez and David Sickler, an AFL-CIO regional director, found that while the 
organizing campaign included "some widely circulated inappropriate appeals," 
including several attempts at intimidation by pro-union cemetery workers, it 
was not "permeated by confusion, fear or threats of violence such that the 
atmosphere rendered a fair election impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Kennedy, an attorney and former National Labor Relations Board regional 
director, dissented. "Employees were threatened with physical assaults, 
discharge, layoff . . . and complaints to the United States Immigration Service 
because they did not support the union," he wrote. "The majority opinion, like 
the conduct it condones, is outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Mejia, manager of the textile union's California joint board, said she 
looks forward "to meeting with Archbishop Mahony as soon as possible to start 
negotiations -- and to begin the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Mahony or a representative of the archdiocese for comment were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the dispute agreed that many of the improvements in wages and 
medical benefits originally sought by the union have been made by the 
archdiocese since the organizing campaign began more than 18 months ago. Mejia 
attributed that to union pressure and said her goal now is to adopt a contract 
that "locks in what the workers currently have."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALLRED TO AID APPEAL IN NURSING HOME RAPE 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing at the bedside of a brain-damaged woman who was raped in a nursing 
home, feminist attorney Gloria Allred announced Tuesday that she will file a 
brief to support the appeal of a judge's decision that bars the woman from 
collecting $7.5 million awarded her by a civil court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter set aside the 
award to Andrea Nerpel, a 39-year-old accident victim who was raped in 1982 
while a patient at the Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital in North Hollywood. 
Nerpel became pregnant, had an abortion and was later sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Schacter said Nerpel's attorney, Alan J. Schultz, offered no evidence during 
the trial to prove that Nerpel suffered damage from the incident.

ELEPHANT DOING OK AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 19-year-old elephant who underwent the first-ever Cesarean section on a 
pachyderm was alert and "doing fine" Tuesday, according to officials at the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the park, said that Jean, a 7,000-pound African 
elephant, had slept on her feet Monday night after the four-hour surgery was 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning she had "seemed depressed," he said, but had taken a bath and 
interacted with the other elephants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are cautiously optimistic," he said, noting that Jean has not yet begun to 
eat. "She had a good afternoon, standing up on her own strength. So far, the 
vets aren't worried." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a team of 11 doctors removed a 300-pound dead fetus from the mother 
after determining that the surgery was necessary to save her life. They 
worried, however, that Jean could become infected by the fetus' decomposing 
tissue. They will continue to monitor the elephant around the clock for signs 
of infection, Hanscom said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY IMPOSES CONTRACT DESPITE POLICE 
PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under protests from police union officials, the Long Beach City Council Tuesday 
declared an impasse in labor negotiations with the Long Beach police union and 
adopted the city's last contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. planned to seek a 
restraining order today to block the city from imposing the new one-year 
contract, which greatly increases management clout in the 650-member Police 
Department. City management has insisted that major changes in personnel 
policies are necessary to more efficiently manage the understaffed department 
and improve police service. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials have said there will be no job actions, but vow they will fight 
the new contract legally and politically. "Unconditional surrender is what they 
want and they aren't going to get it," said union President Mike Tracy.

A company seeking to build a hazardous waste incinerator in Vernon sued the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District Tuesday, claiming the agency 
unfairly required new environmental studies before renewing its building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Security Environmental Systems Inc. charged in its federal suit that the AQMD 
denied it its due process rights by forcing it to meet the newly imposed 
environmental reporting requirements after it had already met previous 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the conditions imposed this year on its second request since 
1987 to win AQMD extensions on 21 building permits were tantamount to a 
revocation of all the permits it had sought from governments and regulators 
since it began the project in 1985.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMITTEE BACKS MORE FUNDING FOR FOOT 
PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee voted Tuesday to support spending more 
money on a controversial police foot patrol program after funds originally 
budgeted for it run out on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Budget and Finance Committee voted 3 to 0 to recommend spending 
an additional $250,000 for the program. The matter now goes before the full 
council, which earlier refused to override Mayor Tom Bradley's veto of a 
$2.5-million budget for the program. Bradley called the expenditure a 
"premature raid on the city's reserve fund." 
</P>
<P>
The foot patrols, which began in September, apparently are highly popular among 
residents in the 18 "crime hot spots" where they operate. Money for the first 
three months of the program was allocated from the existing Police Department 
budget.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'MOON DIAL' ARTIST FAILS IN FINAL PLEA TO 
SAVE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a final bid to keep his controversial "Moon Dial" sculpture on display in a 
park along Santa Monica Boulevard, artist George Herms asked the Beverly Hills 
City Council Tuesday night to reverse its order to remove the piece by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was invited to bring this piece to Beverly Hills, I didn't mean to 
bring in visual Muzak," he told the council. "This was an opportunity to bring 
some challenging art to Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
City officials died not budge, however, sticking to their earlier order giving 
Herms until Friday to remove the assemblage of five rusty buoys and two old 
window grates. Otherwise, workmen will take it down at 1 p.m. Monday, store it 
and bill him, they said.

IGNORING PLANNERS' ADVICE, S.D. COUNCIL APPROVES GOLF COURSE NEAR LAKE HODGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the opposition of environmentalists, Escondido leaders scored a 
hole-in-one with golfers Tuesday by persuading the San Diego City Council to 
reverse city planners and approve permits on a 40-acre parcel to complete an 
18-hole golf course near Lake Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego planning commissioners had voted 6 to 1 to deny the use of the former 
agricultural land in the San Pasqual Valley for a public golf course, citing 
the loss of habitat for the black-tailed gnatcatcher and the possibility of 
pesticide contamination in Lake Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis, speaking for the four Escondido 
council members present, pleaded the case of her city, pointing out that San 
Diego is a partner in the golf course development, had sold an adjoining tract 
to Escondido for the golf course and a housing development, and will share in 
the net profits when the facility is built. 
</P>
<P>
Delay could endanger negotiations with a golf course operator, DeDominicis 
said, and might delay the start of play by a year. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis offered to mitigate the loss of habitat for the gnatcatcher with 
similar land about a mile away. She countered the contamination charge by 
pointing out that agricultural operations on the land would cause more 
pesticide runoff than a golf course would. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote of the San Diego council, with Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer 
absent, was conditioned on the approval of the substitute habitat land by a San 
Diego city biologist. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's hearing, DeDominicis said the construction of the municipal 
course will continue on schedule and allow the facility to open in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, whose district includes the northeastern San Diego area, opposed 
the project earlier because it involved a 528-home subdivision in the San 
Dieguito River Valley, where she is attempting to create a linear open space 
park stretching 42 miles from Del Mar east to near Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement between the two cities worked out two years ago, Escondido 
purchased 276 aces of San Diego-owned land on the boundary of the two cities 
for $12.6 million, then immediately sold the land to a developer of a 580-unit 
subdivision. About 120 acres was deeded back to Escondido by the developer for 
the public golf course. 
</P>
<P>
When it became apparent that the golf course layout would require more land, 
the San Diego City Council agreed to lease Escondido the 40 acres for 62 years. 
The land had formerly been part of the San Pasqual Winery vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer had opposed the 62-year lease of the city land as "a violation of 
law and policy" which was "done in the back room with the good old boys at 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the original land sale and lease, residents of both cities will 
pay lower greens fees on the new course than will outsiders, with senior 
citizens getting a greater discount. Escondido will pay for construction of the 
course but will share any profits from its operation equally with the city of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course will lie east of Interstate 15 near the North County Fair 
shopping center on the southern edge of Escondido.

GROUPS SAY SEA WORLD IS BLINDING DOLPHINS; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL RIGHTS: A COALITION CLAIMS THE PARK'S PETTING POOL IS DAMAGING THE EYES 
OF THE MAMMALS, BUT A CURATOR CALLED THAT CHARGE "BALDERDASH." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who trained Flipper joined three animal rights groups Tuesday to accuse 
Sea World of blinding the 18 dolphins and whales that live in its petting pool, 
but a curator at the private theme park called the charges "balderdash." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with photographs and a laboratory analysis of chlorine levels, Richard 
O'Barry, the former trainer of the five dolphins who played Flipper in the 
1960s television series, said a quick visit to Sea World had convinced him that 
the 18 animals are losing their sight in the 80-foot-long pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one has their eyes closed. They're closing their eyes for a reason," he 
said, adding that dolphins' horseshoe-shaped pupils usually are clearly 
visible. "I can't prove it without an examination. But they're going blind -- 
just take my word for it." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Trimingham, president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, agreed. 
"These animals' eyes are deteriorating. There are sunken black holes where 
their eyes should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Antrim, vice president and senior curator of marine mammals, acknowledged 
that Sea World has never formally studied the effects of chlorine on marine 
mammals. But Antrim called O'Barry's and Trimingham's assertions "preposterous 
balderdash." 
</P>
<P>
"The charge that we would wantonly do something to damage or blind our animals 
is the most absurd thing I've ever heard in my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 dolphins and two pilot whales that live in the 13-foot-deep pool, two 
have "some degree of vision impairment" that was incurred before 1979, when the 
petting pool opened, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals will squint sometimes, just like you or me, but it's unrelated to 
chlorine or anything else environmental," he said, adding that the addition of 
chlorine is necessary to offset bacteria from animal waste in the enclosed 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have deified these animals," he said of O'Barry, Trimingham and 
the representatives of San Diego Animal Advocates and the Fund for Animals who 
staged an afternoon press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Trimingham supported his group's demands -- for a larger, less crowded tank and 
lower chlorine levels -- with a laboratory report of two samples he said he 
collected at the park. The sample taken from the petting pool had 0.6 
milligrams of chlorine in each liter, about three times that of a sample taken 
from the marine mammal pool, which tested at 0.17 milligrams per liter, 
Trimingham's test showed. 
</P>
<P>
When presented with these figures, Antrim said they were a bit low. He said the 
park's pools are tested 10 times a day in order to keep the chlorine level 
constant -- from 0.5 to 1.3 milligrams per liter. 
</P>
<P>
For dolphins and whales, which have a mucous layer in their eyes to protect 
them from salt water, this amount of chlorine is not an irritant, Antrim said. 
San Diego tap water has an average of 1.5 milligrams of chlorine per liter, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Homer Malaby, an animal care specialist with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, which regulates the park, the acceptable level of 
chlorine is anywhere from 0.3 to 3.0 milligrams per liter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Barry scoffed at the USDA's opinion, saying, "They're inspecting hot dogs one 
day and dolphins the next." But he said his broader concern is that children 
learn the wrong thing at a petting pool -- namely that dolphins are beggar-like 
animals that exist only for the amusement of humans. In the wild, he said, 
dolphins will swim 40 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
"That space is not big enough for one dolphin," he said of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
But Antrim called the petting pool "a very popular exhibit that we feel is very 
educational" to the park's 3.8 million visitors a year.

EROTICA PUBLISHER IN SANTA CLARITA OPERATES LEGALLY, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vice officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday 
that a company that prints sexually explicit material in the Santa Clarita 
Valley is operating legally and cannot be shut down, despite protests from 
residents who want to drive the firm away. 
</P>
<P>
"While they do print explicit material, they do not print materials that courts 
have held are obscene," Lt. Dennis Slocumb said. 
</P>
<P>
The vice unit inspected London Press, in the Valencia Industrial Center, in 
July shortly after the press moved to the Santa Clarita Valley from North 
Hollywood, where it had operated for 28 years. Law enforcement officers say 
London Press is one of the largest producers of sexually explicit material in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
This month, three residents, who earlier this year helped gather more than 800 
signatures on petitions opposing the printer, asked the Santa Clarita Valley 
sheriff's station to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
The request was referred to Slocumb's vice unit, where it was received Tuesday. 
Slocumb said the department saw no reason to alter its earlier assessment of 
the printer's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Slocumb said London Press officials cooperated when a vice officer asked to 
inspect the plant in the summer. The officer did not have a warrant and could 
have been turned away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
London Press officials did not return phone calls Tuesday. Slocumb said the 
company prints many types of publications, not just erotica, and carefully 
disposes of sexually explicit materials to ensure they are not found by 
youngsters rummaging through trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
Slocumb said the company does not stage or photograph erotic scenes. He said 
the firm did not violate obscenity statutes, which prohibit certain types of 
hard-core sex scenes, while operating in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The residents who led the petition drive said they still hoped to drive the 
company out of the conservative Santa Clarita Valley. "Community influence can 
do a lot," Laurie Winkle said. 
</P>
<P>
Winkle said she and other neighborhood activists started a successful petition 
drive five years ago that persuaded Liquor Barn, a large discount liquor retail 
chain, not to open a store in a Valencia shopping center because it was near 
five schools. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Blanken said she and other Santa Clarita residents realize that London 
Press only prints the erotic material and that the community has no X-rated 
bookstores where it could be sold. But the residents are concerned about the 
printer's impact on society as a whole. "We should be concerned about all 
citizens, not just our own community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much in favor of freedom of the press," Blanken said. But pornography 
should be curtailed, she said, because it can produce criminal behavior that 
can harm others.

LANDLORDS BACK STREET CLOSURES IN DRUG WAR BUT ASK WHO WILL PAY COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group of Sepulveda apartment owners formed a committee Tuesday to study the 
possibility of establishing a guard station at the entrance to a 
12-square-block area barricaded by police two weeks ago to curtail drive-by 
drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the program has been so successful that the streets should be 
permanently closed off, allowing residents and guests to enter only through a 
guard station at Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which would have to approve permanently removing the streets 
from public use, is scheduled to consider an interim measure today that would 
keep the roadblocks up as long as police deem necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night about 15 people -- owners or managers of about a third of the 60 
apartment buildings in the area -- met with police officials. They endorsed the 
proposal but stopped short of agreeing to pay for it. Many owners live outside 
the city and were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally for anything it takes to keep out drugs, but we have to find 
out what the others think," said Mila Casper of Northridge, who owns 18 units 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Several private security firms have submitted bids to staff the guardhouse, but 
declined Tuesday to reveal their estimates of the cost. However, a 
representative of Efficient Patrol &amp; Guard Service of Van Nuys -- which did 
not bid on the business -- said a 24-hour guard could cost from $6,000 to 
$9,000 per month, depending on whether the guard was armed. 
</P>
<P>
Casper said the newly formed association will look into whether it can pass on 
part of the cost to residents in the form of a monthly charge. Under the city's 
rent control laws, landlords may raise rents to pay for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But one property owner said Tuesday in a telephone interview that taxpayers 
should foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea, but I think they should use taxes to pay for it," said 
Vernon Mesick of Carpinteria. He said that if he lived in the neighborhood, he 
would try to organize the tenants to staff the guardhouse themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Mark D. Stevens told the apartment owners that the cost of 
staffing the guardhouse would be well worth it. In the two weeks since police 
put up the sawhorse barricades, drug traffic has been virtually wiped out in 
the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said some property owners expressed concerns about the appearance of 
the guardhouse, whether "it will look like a neighborhood you or I would want 
to live in."

CITY FUNDS BROWN FIELD STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday agreed to fund an $18,000 study by the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments to determine whether Brown Field can be expanded 
to handle takeoffs and landings of major airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-day study is expected to give the council a glimpse of whether a "dual 
airport" concept, employing both Lindbergh and Brown fields for airline and 
cargo traffic, is technologically feasible and merits further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag will review a proposal for Brown drawn up by a private consultant to 
expand the city-owned general aviation airport and build two runways on a 
southwest-to-northeast axis. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council lifted a year-old building moratorium on residential, 
commercial and industrial development around Brown, virtually killing all 
chances for a large binational airport on Otay Mesa along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
That move effectively leaves the dual airport solution and joint 
civilian-military use of Miramar Naval Air Station as the only alternatives to 
increasingly crowded Lindbergh Field. The Navy is adamantly opposed to the 
second option. 
</P>
<P>
In another action Tuesday, the council authorized City Manager John Lockwood to 
begin negotiations to purchase land around the Brown Field airstrip that would 
be needed to extend the runway.

PANEL OKS CURBS ON COLD BEER, WINE SALES AT 3 PACOIMA STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee, told that Pacoima has become the 
"drunk-driving capital of the city," voted Tuesday to impose strict rules on 
three Pacoima liquor outlets, including a ban on selling cold beer and wine and 
on the sale of single cans or small bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rules were applauded by some community leaders who have been 
fighting widespread drunkenness and resulting crime. But some local activists 
said the rules were too harsh and would discourage other East San Fernando 
Valley liquor sellers from voluntarily complying with anti-drunkenness 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Before they become law, the new restrictions -- proposed by Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, who represents the area -- must be approved by the full council and 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
City Zoning Administrator Jon Perica, who drafted the rules, said police 
reports showed more than 750 drunk-driving arrests during the past 16 months 
near the intersection of San Fernando Road and Van Nuys Boulevard, "making 
Pacoima the drunk-driving capital of the city. No other area comes close." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said that the three outlets chosen for the stricter regulations were 
"the worst of the violators," but that others would be included in the 
crackdown "if they don't clean up their act." 
</P>
<P>
The targeted stores are Leon's Liquor, John's Liquor and Pacoima Food Market. 
The restrictions would affect only the three because they were written as 
amendments to the zoning permits the stores operate under. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who chairs the committee, said the bans on selling cold 
liquor and liquor in small quantities are "aimed at discouraging the individual 
from loitering outside after buying liquor or drinking it in his car." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the three outlets must promptly remove graffiti and remove all but 
a single sign advertising liquor for sale. They also must stop selling alcohol 
at 10 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and at midnight Fridays and Saturdays, 
instead of selling until 2 a.m. as state law permits. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Sandy Jo MacArthur told the committee that liquor stores 
elsewhere in the city "have had no problem sustaining a thriving business with 
these conditions." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Josh Kaplan, representing John's Liquor, argued that requiring 
customers to buy more than one can or bottle is "utter nonsense" and will 
encourage rather than discourage liquor consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, who recently founded an activist group called the San Fernando 
Valley Community Advisory Board, said that giving the rules the force of law 
"will mean that we will no longer be able to get merchants to voluntarily 
comply. Why should they go along if the city cracks down anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's group claims that 22 Pacoima merchants, including Leon's and John's, 
are voluntarily following most of the same rules the city is moving to impose. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Milford Harvey of the San Fernando Valley Ministers Alliance said 
banning the sale of cold beer and wine is "pointless . . . because 75% of the 
trouble in our community is hard liquor, not beer and wine."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK GIRL, 8, ELUDES ATTACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank police are looking for a man who tried to abduct an 8-year-old Burbank 
girl Monday as she walked from Bret Harte Elementary School, Burbank police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when the man drove a white delivery van alongside the girl 
as she walked west on Allen Avenue, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. The driver asked 
her for directions. When she refused to respond, he continued to drive beside 
her and repeated his question, frightening her and prompting her to run south 
on Kenwood Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The man parked the van ahead of the girl, got out and grabbed her arm as she 
walked down Kenwood near Edison Boulevard, Goldberg said. He drove off when she 
screamed for help, getting the attention of several passers-by, Goldberg said. 
The girl was not injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said the van had a customized back end for moving large loads and had 
gold-colored lettering on the side. The man is described as a 25- to 
30-year-old Latino, 6 feet, 2 inches tall, with a medium build and black hair. 
He was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 BADLY INJURED WHEN CAR DRIFTS OFF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three members of a family from San Bernardino County were injured, two 
seriously, early Tuesday when the car in which they were riding veered off the 
Golden State Freeway north of Los Angeles and flipped over, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Katherine Aguirre, 21, and passenger Brandon Aguirre, 1, were 
thrown from the car in the 4 a.m. crash near Gorman, said California Highway 
Patrol Officer Mark Ehly. Passenger Bryan Aguirre, 26, was not ejected, Ehly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All three were taken to Henry Mayo Memorial Hospital in Newhall, where 
Katherine Aguirre was listed in critical condition and Brandon Aguirre was in 
stable condition, Ehly said. Bryan Aguirre received only minor injuries. The 
family lives in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
The three were traveling north near Hungry Valley Road when the car drifted off 
the freeway and down an embankment, Ehly said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident had not been determined, he said.

WHEN WAR ENDS, THE OLD ORDER GOES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: WINSTON CHURCHILL LOST HIS JOB WHEN WORLD WAR II ENDED. GEORGE BUSH 
MAY FIND THAT THE END OF THE COLD WAR DOES THE SAME THING TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican euphoria at the prospect of a huge diplomatic victory for President 
Bush when he meets with Mikhail Gorbachev, the beleaguered master of the 
crumbling communist empire, is tempered by one historical fact. When wars end, 
governments change. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush-Gorbachev summit off Malta next month conveys the message that the 
Cold War really is over, the political environment here at home will be 
profoundly altered -- and in ways that may not be conducive to continued 
Republican-conservative control. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, I shared the shock most Americans felt when the British voters 
dumped Winston Churchill just as World War II was ending. It seemed -- and 
probably was -- rank ingratitude, but the British clearly felt that they could 
dispense with their great leader. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should we have been surprised. Two years after the end of World War I, 
American voters pitched out the Democrats who had led the nation through that 
struggle. And they turned out to be as restless as the British after World War 
II. In the mid-term election of 1946, just 15 months after the Japanese 
surrender, our voters ended 14 years of Democratic control and elected a 
Republican Congress. These examples all deal with real wars, not the Cold War, 
and so, it may be argued, they do not count as precedents for the current 
situation. But consider what contributed to the postwar political upheavals and 
the parallels become significant. 
</P>
<P>
One cause was exhaustion -- the public's recognition that politically and 
intellectually, the people in power had run out of gas. They had expended so 
much of their energy in figuring out how to wage war that they just didn't have 
fresh resources to meet new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, that's exactly the signal Bush sent voters with his lackadaisical 
reaction to stunning scenes of the breaching of the Berlin Wall. On a reporting 
trip I took to the Midwest last week, that topic came up more than any other, 
with supporters and critics alike asking, "Why didn't Bush react?" It might be 
that after a quarter of a century in the trenches of the Cold War, Bush is 
intellectually tired. 
</P>
<P>
He was a hawkish congressman in Vietnam days, a diplomat keeping tabs on 
communists at the United Nations and in China and a spymaster running the CIA. 
Then he was Ronald Reagan's lieutenant in the last big military buildup. 
Insiders say Bush is eager to start dealing with Gorbachev, but after what they 
have seen, the voters can be forgiven for thinking he may have trouble 
readjusting his sights to a radically altered world. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason for earlier postwar political upheavals has been economic 
disruption. Typically, it's taken the form of a surge of inflation from pent-up 
consumer demand. Our economy seems relatively inflation-proof at the moment, 
but a sharp deceleration of military spending, now accepted as certain by 
everyone, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, will have strong -- and 
uneven -- impacts. 
</P>
<P>
Already, politicians in states like Texas and California are beginning to worry 
about what may happen to communities dependent on military bases and production 
lines. Just as the Sunbelt benefited most from the Reagan-era military buildup, 
it will probably feel the sharpest effects of the Bush-Cheney slowdown. If 
Sunbelters have to start worrying about their economic future, the GOP has 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The third and final element of past postwar upheavals has been a shift of 
public focus from one set of challenges to another. Economic competition with 
Japan is now seen as a greater threat to the United States than military 
competition with communism. 
</P>
<P>
What is the Bush Administration answer to this challenge, symbolized by the 
Japanese purchase of Rockefeller Center? Not to raise trade barriers, thank 
goodness. But if the United States is not to turn protectionist, then competing 
in world markets almost certainly requires improving our education system, 
stepping up research and development, modernizing our transport network -- the 
kind of activist government investment policy that Democrats find far easier to 
espouse than Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
All this is suggestive of basic political change, though not conclusive. 
Certainly one cannot argue that Republicans are doomed to defeat or Democrats 
fated for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing I would bet: The chances of such a turnabout are much higher if 
the Cold War really is over than they would be if Bush could soldier on in the 
familiar battle with communists for another seven years.

WORK BEGINS ON BURBANK CANCER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank marked the start of 
construction on a $70-million cancer treatment center Tuesday with a ceremony 
preceded by a celebratory Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The Most Rev. Armando Ochoa, auxiliary bishop in Los Angeles, officiated at the 
ceremony and blessed the ground on which the six-story, 170,000-square-foot 
Robertson Tower will be built. 
</P>
<P>
A North Hollywood businessman and his wife who donated $7 million toward 
construction of the center were among about 150 people who attended the 11 a.m. 
ceremony at the entrance to the hospital, at Buena Vista Street and Alameda 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear residents Jack Robertson, 51, owner of Robertson Honda, and his wife, 
Diane, 52, said their contribution was made in honor of their late parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sisters of Providence are such a wonderful and dedicated group of women 
that we wanted to do something to support them," said Diane Robertson, whose 
parents died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisters of Providence founded the nonprofit hospital in 1944. With 647 
beds, it is the largest health-care facility in the San Fernando Valley and the 
largest Catholic hospital in the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new center will feature state-of-the-art facilities for cancer detection, 
treatment, education and research, said Richard E. Horowitz, the hospital's 
director of pathology. Hospice and family counseling facilities will be 
included in the expansion, scheduled to be completed in early 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
'It's estimated that one in four people in our service area -- some 300,000 
citizens -- will encounter cancer in their lives," Horowitz said. "The expanded 
cancer program will allow us to significantly enhance the medical center's 
already strong cancer program." 
</P>
<P>
Also planned are new intensive care and mental health units, a laboratory for 
diagnosis of vascular diseases and expanded facilities for diagnosis in 
radiology and nuclear medicine. 
</P>
<P>
With the Robertsons' contribution, the hospital foundation has raised nearly 
$13 million of its contribution goal of $15 million for the cancer center, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-exempt bonds and hospital operating fees will generate the balance of the 
$70 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were Burbank Mayor Robert R. Bowne, City Manager 
Robert Ovrom, and Councilmen Michael Hastings and Michael Flavin.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After one week of deliberations, the jury in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of 
Nancy Hoover Hunter indicated Tuesday that it may deliberate for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors sent a note to U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam inquiring about 
the holiday schedule. The note said some jurors are trying to make vacation 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
One juror said her family is planning to travel to the East Coast on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The 197 charges against Hunter are in six categories: one count of conspiracy, 
four counts of tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a federal 
agency, 85 counts of fraud by a commodities pool operator, 101 counts of mail 
fraud, and five counts of aiding and abetting in the preparation of a false tax 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the counts against Hunter carries a prison sentence ranging from three 
years to five years, as well as a fine of $1,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 witnesses -- including Roger Hedgecock, a former San Diego mayor, 
and Hunter, a former mayor of Del Mar -- have testified in the longest criminal 
trial in the history of San Diego federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is also examining about 2,000 pieces of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 51, is charged with being an active member of the J. David &amp; Co. 
Ponzi scheme, which caused about 1,200 people to lose $80 million. J. David 
(Jerry) Dominelli, the mastermind of the fraud and Hunter's former lover, is 
serving 20 years in federal prison as a result of a 1985 plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was an executive in several J. David entities, and she was Dominelli's 
broker of record on many of his commodities trades. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's attorneys have argued throughout the trial, which began in mid-April, 
that she was completely unaware of Dominelli's activities because she was in 
love with him.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN STEPDAUGHTER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lake Los Angeles man has pleaded not guilty to murder in the beating death of 
his 4-year-old stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the same proceeding in Lancaster Municipal Court on Monday, the girl's 
mother pleaded not guilty to child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
William Sherman Welshans, 24, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Welshans, 23, are 
charged in the Oct. 24 death of Christine Blalock, 4. They remained free on 
bail of $6,000 and $3,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on the charges was set for Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
William Welshans was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after his wife 
returned home, found her daughter's body and called authorities, according to 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Welshans first told investigators he believed Christine was fatally injured 
when she fell from a woodpile at the couple's home in the rural eastern 
Antelope Valley. However, Welshans admitted to beating the girl with his fists 
on the day of her death and during the previous three days, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Welshans told investigators he did not mean to kill the girl and said he did 
not take her to a hospital because he feared the abuse would be discovered, the 
documents said. He told investigators he was under stress because of marital 
and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charge was filed last week based on a coroner's report and 
investigators' findings. 
</P>
<P>
Welshans' $6,000 bail was set and paid before the murder charge was filed. 
Prosecutors decided not to raise the amount because Welshans does not appear to 
be a threat to the community and because the charge will probably be 
second-degree murder or manslaughter rather than first-degree murder, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley. The degree and type of murder has not yet 
been specified, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welshans also is charged with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Welshans told investigators she left for work on the day of her daughter's 
death, although she knew that the youngster was ill and that Welshans had 
beaten the girl, as well as his 5-year-old stepson and the couple's 
19-month-old daughter, according to the court documents. She said she returned 
home to find Christine dead and Welshans asleep in another room. 
</P>
<P>
William Welshans' stepson, who is Mary's son, and the couple's daughter have 
been placed in foster care homes, authorities said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL '89-90; 
</P>
<P>
BIG REASON FOR LEWIS' CHANGE NOW APPARENT; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TOM LEWIS WAS CONSIDERED SELFISH AT USC, BUT RAISING A DAUGHTER IS 
THE MAIN CONCERN NOW FOR PEPPERDINE STANDOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before going their separate ways, Hank Gathers to Loyola Marymount and Tom 
Lewis to Pepperdine, they were teammates and classmates as freshmen at USC. 
During one class midway through that 1985-86 season, Gathers recalled recently, 
he passed a note to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the players on the team don't like you," Gathers' note said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care," Lewis wrote back on the same piece of paper. "Nobody has to 
like me." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 14, Valentine's Day, Pepperdine will play at Loyola Marymount. Before 
the game, the referee will introduce co-captain Gathers to co-captain Lewis. 
The significance of the moment will be lost on neither. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the only thing that Gathers believed Lewis was capable of 
captaining was a sinking basketball team, which is what USC had at the time. 
</P>
<P>
It is not likely that players have changed so much since then that they would 
elect someone as their co-captain who does not care if he is liked. So it must 
be assumed that the change has been in Tom Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just look at him and tell he's a changed guy," said Gathers, who has 
remained friends with Lewis even though their universities are rivals in the 
West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious on the court because he's passing the ball more. At SC, he had 
the ability to do a lot of different things. Passing was one of them. But he 
very rarely did it because he was out only for Tom." 
</P>
<P>
The change in Lewis, however, is even more obvious away from basketball. In 
fact, he believes that it was his maturity off the court that led to his 
emergence as a team leader. "I'm a better person, which makes me a better 
player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he is older. A teen-ager when he entered USC, he turned 23 earlier this 
month and will earn his degree in communications next spring. It is only 
natural that he would have grown some as a person. 
</P>
<P>
But he also found a comfort zone at Pepperdine, which offers a more intimate 
setting than USC. A church-affiliated university in Malibu with an enrollment 
of 6,800, it might not be right for everyone. But apparently it was for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
His first coach at Pepperdine, Jim Harrick, treated him like a member of his 
family. One of Lewis' closest friends today is Harrick's son. Although 
Pepperdine's current coach, Tom Asbury, does not have the same relationship 
with Lewis, they share a mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, however, Lewis has found true love. 
</P>
<P>
It came in a small package during his freshman year at USC and has not gotten a 
whole heck of a lot larger yet. His daughter, Holly, will turn 4 in January. 
Now, no one can say that Tom is out only for Tom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a good basketball player, but I think I'm a great father," he said. "I 
know that I try my hardest. It's also the thing that gives me the most 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the achievements I've had in basketball, none of them come even close 
to comparing to the way I feel about Holly. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's also helped me in basketball. I've learned a lot about life, about 
growing up and deciding what's important. Being a father puts things in 
perspective real quick." 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to find anyone who follows basketball in Southern 
California who is not familiar with Lewis' saga. Because he was able at a young 
age to do what is supposed to be done with a basketball, put it through the 
hoop, his private life has hardly been private. 
</P>
<P>
While living in Boston as a child, his parents divorced. He has not seen his 
father since the age of 7. His mother worked two jobs while raising three 
children before she remarried and moved to San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school freshman, Lewis played for the sophomore team at Capistrano 
Valley, which was coached by Pat Barrett. When Lewis and his mother had a 
falling out, at least in part because he could not get along with his 
stepfather, he left home and moved in with Barrett and his parents in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Lewis transferred to Santa Ana Mater Dei High School, which 
later hired Barrett as a member of the coaching staff. Other coaches charged 
that Mater Dei used "undue influence" to recruit Lewis. His relationship with 
Barrett was put under a microscope. Was Barrett, not quite 30 at the time, a 
guardian angel or an opportunist? 
</P>
<P>
But if the world was swirling around him, Lewis kept his balance on the court. 
As he grew from 6-foot-3 to 6-7 in three years at Mater Dei, the team lost only 
five games and won two Southern Section championships. He was a two-time high 
school All-American, averaging 32 points a game as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
He was recruited by many of the country's most prestigious college basketball 
programs -- Kentucky, Syracuse, Maryland, UNLV, UCLA. Deciding to remain in 
Southern California but unhappy about UCLA's coaching change to Walt Hazzard, 
he chose USC. 
</P>
<P>
Again, he found himself at the center of controversy. Other players from that 
team say that there was resentment because USC's coach at the time, Stan 
Morrison, gave Lewis the green light to shoot, a rare accommodation for a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Morrison gave him nothing; he earned his shots because of his 
production. He led the team by scoring 17.6 points a game, more than any other 
freshman in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he was being selfish," said another freshman on that team, Bo 
Kimble, who transferred to Loyola Marymount after the season. "He was only 
doing what the coach would let him do. But the older guys didn't know how to 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said he and Kimble told Lewis that he should try to get along better 
with his teammates, advice they believed he needed after he was involved in 
several fights during practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that, deep down, Tom cared about whether he was liked or not," 
Gathers said. "But he didn't know how to make it happen for him at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"He had never learned how to play a role on a team, how to affiliate his 
talents into a team with players who were just as good as he was." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was under such intense scrutiny in high school that he already had built 
a protective shell around himself by the time he arrived at USC. He got along 
with Gathers and Kimble, but most of his other teammates found him aloof. 
Neither he nor they made the effort to become friends. 
</P>
<P>
So most of them never were aware of his personal problems that season. In 
January, his girlfriend, who was still in high school, gave birth to their 
daughter. Lewis, who had never had much luck with fathers, suddenly was one. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the players thought that I didn't like them because they didn't see me 
very much outside the gym," he said. "But they didn't understand that, while 
they were going to parties on weekends, I was going home to help change 
diapers." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he also would be changing universities, fueling further controversy. USC 
Athletic Director Mike McGee asked Morrison to resign at the end of the season, 
then hired George Raveling, leading to the transfers of Gathers, Kimble and 
Lewis. Lewis chose UC Irvine, changed his mind before attending a class and 
landed at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he did not feel wanted at USC after Morrison left. He still 
corresponds with Morrison, who is the coach at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it had worked out at SC," Lewis said. "I don't know whether it was 
McGee or George (Raveling) who didn't want me to stay. But now they've got the 
players they want, the program they want. Now they have to sleep in their own 
bed." 
</P>
<P>
Even after Lewis arrived at Pepperdine for his redshirt season in 1986-87, 
Asbury, an assistant at the time, said he and Harrick believed that Lewis would 
have been better off if he had remained at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that what he needed at that particular time in his life was some 
stability," Asbury said. "He would have had a coaching change either way, but 
it wouldn't have been a change of scenery." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Harrick gave Lewis what he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom just needed some tender loving care," said Harrick, now at UCLA. "When you 
talk about parents, he was almost devoid of that kind of relationship. I took 
him into my home, introduced him to my family, and we all became really close. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not an easy guy to get to know, but his reputation, the perception that 
he has some kind of attitude, is not right. He wants to be a good guy, and he 
is a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Harrick also lectured him for hours about becoming a complete 
basketball player. But in Harrick's attacking offense, Lewis played the role of 
shooting guard as well as small forward and was still primarily a scorer. He 
led the team in scoring as a sophomore, averaging 22.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
Before last season, however, Harrick left for UCLA. Lewis was faced with his 
third coaching change in four years, this time to Asbury. He was Harrick's 
assistant for nine years, but his philosophy was different. His team would be 
more structured offensively, more disciplined defensively. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a perfect fit for Lewis at the start of last season. Asbury sent him 
home early from some practices. In a game at Gonzaga in January, Asbury benched 
Lewis for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw that we would do something about it if he didn't give us what we 
wanted," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have had an understanding. They will do things Asbury's way, 
but they also will talk about them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had our moments, and we still do in all honesty," Asbury said. "He'll 
question you; he'll tell you what he thinks. I like that. We will not let each 
other not communicate with each other. That is a real mistake with Tom. He has 
to be communicated with." 
</P>
<P>
Among things that Asbury has communicated to Lewis is that he must concentrate 
more on defense, rebound, look for the open man and, above all else, take 
better shots. He still led the team in scoring last year, but his average was 
down to 16.2 and his shooting percentage was a feeble 42.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Tom's problem is selfishness," Asbury said. "It's just that he 
wants to win so much he takes things on himself. I'm trying to convince him 
that he can help us more if he takes better shots and shoots 50%. That's very 
do-able." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis appears to have gotten the message. He said one of his best games last 
season was against UC Irvine, when he took only nine shots but was tenacious on 
defense and on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'd want a steady dose of that," Asbury said. "A scorer likes 
to score. But I think he will score more this year." 
</P>
<P>
If he averages 17.2 points, he will become Pepperdine's all-time leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Asbury is the same as any other coach," Lewis said. "He wants an overall 
game from me. There's this misconception that we don't get along. That's not 
true at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different relationship than I had with Coach Harrick. But people 
should stop thinking that we have problems. In fact, sometimes I kind of enjoy 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis appears to be enjoying life in general. He lives on campus at Pepperdine 
but still spends free weekends in Garden Grove with the Barretts. As Pat 
Barrett works with 23 other basketball players at the Performance Training 
Institute in Anaheim, he does not have time to attend every one of Lewis' 
practices, as he did at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The court of public opinion is still divided on Barrett's role in Lewis' life, 
but both Harrick and Asbury have nothing but good things to say about him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was much maligned, but the fact is that he and his parents are good people 
and they love Tom," Harrick said. "They deserve all the credit in the world for 
getting Tom through high school and to college. Now, Tom is growing up and 
becoming his own man." 
</P>
<P>
It is not easy, being a college basketball player, student and father. It might 
be even more difficult for him next year when he begins playing professionally, 
if not in the NBA, then perhaps in Europe. That will put more distance between 
him and his daughter. He realizes that would be the best way to provide for 
her, but he is not particularly looking forward to being separated. 
</P>
<P>
"On Holly's last birthday, I practiced until 6 (p.m.), drove for two hours down 
to her mother's house in Mission Viejo, stayed for three hours and drove two 
hours back home," he said. "I'm going to hate it when I have to leave on the 
day after Christmas to go with the team to Louisiana or somewhere. I just want 
to spend as much time with her as I can. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened with my own father makes me want to be around a lot more. The 
first thing I said after she was born was, 'I'm not leaving.' I'm going to see 
this through. I'm going to be with her for life."

NCAA GETS $1 BILLION FOR TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TV: SEVEN-YEAR CONTRACT WITH CBS CUTS CABLE OUT OF BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 
COVERAGE AS NETWORK CONTINUES SPENDING SPREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
CBS bought exclusive rights to the NCAA men's basketball tournament Tuesday, 
agreeing to a $1-billion, seven-year contract that would provide over-the-air 
coverage of every tournament game, thus eliminating cable television's 
involvement in the NCAA's biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Pilson, CBS Sports president, said the network will televise 60 to 70 
hours of basketball during the 64-team tournament. CBS' current $166-million, 
three-year NCAA tournament contract expires after the 1990 Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a good gamble with the growth of the tournament and the 
tremendous amount of attention it gets," Pilson said. "More people watch the 
college basketball tournament than the Super Bowl and even the World Series. We 
have ourselves a secure, attractive, event. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate making money on this, but we normally don't say how much." 
</P>
<P>
The new contract was the fourth major deal involving CBS in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the network signed a four-year, $1-billion deal with major 
league baseball. CBS then spent $643 million for the 1992 and 1994 Winter 
Olympics. Earlier this month, NBC signed a four-year, $600-million contract 
with the NBA, beginning with the 1990-91 season, ending CBS' 17-year 
association with pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Pilson said that it would have been difficult to offer $1 billion for the NCAA 
tournament if CBS had renewed its NBA contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of money, especially when you have to write it out like I did on 
the baseball contract," Pilson said. "You have to count the zeroes to make sure 
you haven't made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"But those numbers reflect the appetite of the viewers, an appetite we measure 
every 15 minutes through the ratings. One billion dollars is a benchmark, 
that's to be sure, but we would never pay it if we didn't think it was worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the deal are the rights to many NCAA minor sports 
championships, including track, gymnastics and volleyball, as well as expanded 
coverage of the women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also bid on four-year, six-year and a split-network contracts, but Pilson 
said the network's "sole intent" was to renew the contract exclusively. CBS, 
which has been televising NCAA games since 1981, outbid network rivals ABC and 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"I had envisioned our principal competition coming from ABC," he said. "ABC 
gave a strong presentation for the single-event telecast, while NBC gave a 
strong presentation for the split-network telecast." 
</P>
<P>
Pilson said some games will be televised nationally, but most early-round games 
will be shown regionally. Local affiliates will decide which games are shown 
regionally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN had televised many of the early-round games for the last several years. 
Pilson estimated that CBS will reach twice as many households as ESPN did with 
its daytime telecasts, and four times as many viewers as the cable network did 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great event and we're going to miss it," ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys 
said. "We wish CBS well with it." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schultz, the NCAA's executive director, said the NCAA is trying to find 
creative ways to distribute the television money among the member schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have heard about the $400,000 free throw and all the pressure that is 
put on coaches and players," Schultz said. "We are going to work with the 
membership to find ways to alleviate the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said beer commercials would be reduced by 33% on tournament telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have entered a whole new era in television sports," Schultz 
said.

DONAHUE SEES REBUILDING BRUINS AS CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Begging off specific questions about what went wrong, Coach Terry Donahue said 
Tuesday that it might take months to sort out the wreckage of UCLA's worst 
football season in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
This week is too early. 
</P>
<P>
"Things didn't go right," Donahue said. "So we're in the process of taking that 
information and data and trying to systematically and unemotionally evaluate it 
and say, 'What do we have to do to get this thing fixed again? What do we have 
to do to get this thing to fly right?' " 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, ranked among the top 10 before its opener and picked to win the national 
championship by one major newspaper, Newsday, ended the season with a 3-7-1 
record, its worst since 1971, and a six-game winless streak, its longest in 46 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins lost three games by a point and another by three points and probably 
should have beaten three teams that will play in bowl games -- Michigan, 
Washington and USC. But they also absorbed their two worst conference losses of 
the decade, including a 42-7 pounding by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Some have suggested that the Bruins simply were unfortunate, but Donahue said: 
"I don't write off the season to bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the light at the end of the tunnel is not as dim as some might think, 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get back our respectability and get back to the position that we enjoyed 
previous to this season," he said. "I think I can get the team and the program 
back to that (level) very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Although he alluded throughout the season to a dropoff in talent among the 
Bruins, Donahue said: "I think there's enough talent to get us back to where we 
were." 
</P>
<P>
So, what went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"Several things, none of which -- at this point -- I'm prepared to talk about," 
Donahue said. "It was kind of a convergence of numerous factors that hit us all 
at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) I haven't had adequate time to analyze and assess and to disengage 
myself from the season." 
</P>
<P>
With UCLA not playing in a bowl game for the first time since 1980, Donahue 
will spend the next several weeks meeting with his coaching staff, players and 
confidants and will spend the holidays at home with his wife, Andrea, and their 
three daughters, Nicole, Michele and Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
He does not expect UCLA's disastrous season to affect its recruiting success, 
which has been on a par in recent years with Notre Dame's, according to those 
who evaluate such things. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will negatively recruit and talk about our losing season," he 
said. "But our performance over a long time and particularly through the '80s 
has been such that we still have an awful lot to sell and promote." 
</P>
<P>
He added that UCLA's situation is not all that unique among college football 
powers this decade. 
</P>
<P>
USC, for example, was 4-6-1 in 1983 and 6-6 in 1985. Alabama was 5-6 in 1984. 
Last season, Penn State was 5-6 and Ohio State 4-6-1. Even Notre Dame, unbeaten 
in its last 23 games and on the verge of its second straight national 
championship, was 5-6 only three seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Most football programs have experienced this kind of year -- maybe not to the 
same extent, some maybe to a greater extent," Donahue said. "They all seemed to 
have survived it and come back and done pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that we will, too."

SEAU WINS PAC-10 DEFENSIVE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC linebacker Junior Seau and running back Steve Broussard of Washington State 
have been named Pacific 10 defensive and offensive players of the year, and 
Oregon State's Dave Kragthorpe has been named Pac-10 coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, a junior from Oceanside, helped USC's defense lead the nation in rushing 
defense, allowing 61.5 yards a game. Seau led the Pac-10 along with teammate 
Tim Ryan in tackles for losses with 25 for 137 yards, including 18 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, a senior from Los Angeles, was second in the conference in rushing 
with 1,237 yards in 260 carries and 13 touchdowns. A former standout at Manual 
Arts, Broussard also led the Pac-10 in all-purpose yardage with 1,790, and in 
scoring with 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kragthorpe has led the Beavers to a 3-4-1 conference record with a game to 
play. The three conference victories are the most since 1974 for Oregon State, 
4-6-1 overall. Voting was done by the conference coaches.

COLLEGE DIVISION MEN'S PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
IF THEY'RE DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE, CCAA RACE WILL TIGHTEN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expectations were anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
But John Masi, coach of the UC Riverside men's basketball team, wonders if they 
are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Highlanders posted the best record in NCAA Division II basketball 
last season at 30-4, and finished third in the national championship 
tournament, Masi realizes that the pressure to duplicate those accomplishments 
will be great. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have people comparing us (to last season's team) all year long," he 
said. "My biggest job this year is to not let our team get caught up in 
expectations. The advantage other teams will have is that they will also look 
at what we did last year in preparing for us." 
</P>
<P>
With the graduation of All-American guard Maurice Pullum and Chris Jackson, an 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. guard, the comparisons may indeed be a 
little unfair. 
</P>
<P>
But the Highlanders do have an All-CCAA performer returning in forward Chris 
Ceballos, and three other players who started at least seven games. They are 
point guard Reggie Howard -- a superb three-point shooter -- and forwards Mike 
Ritter and Jason Ricks. 
</P>
<P>
All of which makes another CCAA championship and trip to the Division II 
tournament a distinct possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's closest competition should come from another traditional conference 
power, Cal State Bakersfield, although the CCAA appears improved down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield's Pat Douglass has guided the Roadrunners into the 
playoffs in his first two seasons as coach.With four top players returning from 
a 21-9 squad, the trend should continue this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield has two starters back, forward Marvin Redeemer and guard Wade 
Green, and top reserves Beau Redstone at forward and Willie Austin at guard 
also return. Toss in redshirt guards Ray Burris and Fred Eckles and the 
Roadrunners have good reason to make postseason plans. 
</P>
<P>
Usually a CCAA title contender, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo slipped to sixth place 
in the conference and 14-12 overall last season. However, the return of four 
starters plus the addition of two Division-I transfers should make a noticeable 
difference for the Mustangs. Returning players include All-CCAA forward Coby 
Naess and guards James Gama and Shawn Reed. Transfers include forwards Stuart 
Thomas from Stanford and Tim Knowles from Texas San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge is hoping to leave a lasting impression on the CCAA in its 
final season in the conference before stepping up to Division I next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who finished 16-11 last season, may have the personnel to 
contend, including All-CCAA guard Derrick Gathers -- whose brother Hank stars 
for Loyola Marymount -- and forward Kris Brodowski and guard Jemarl Baker. The 
down side is a difficult schedule that includes four Division I opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Where Bob Boyd goes, success usually follows. In 28 seasons, Boyd has a 456-309 
record and has been coach of the year in four conferences including the 
Southeastern and the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
So it will be no surprise if he has a solid team in his first year as coach of 
Chapman, where the Panthers were 17-12 last season. The top returning player is 
forward Rog Middleton, and Boyd has a solid recruiting class, headed by swing 
man Von Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
With the graduation of All-American center Anthony Blackman and the return of 
only one starter from a team that finished 20-10 and reached the Division II 
playoffs, Cal State Dominguez Hills will have one of the youngest teams in the 
CCAA, but the Toros have plenty of ability. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders are point guard Robert Barksdale, swing man Kevin Shaw and guard 
Segaro Bozart. The Toros also have two top freshmen in forwards Vincent 
Washington and Norman Francis. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long time since Cal Poly Pomona has been competitive in the CCAA, 
but Coach Dave Bollwinkel is optimistic. The Broncos have forward Jim Skinner 
and guard D.J. Norman back and added two all-state junior college players in 
forward Terry Ross and guard Chancellor McCobb. That should help the team 
improve upon its marks of 1-13 in the CCAA and 7-19 overall last season. 
</P>
<P>
With a 1-27 record and a 4-48 mark over the last two seasons, the Cal State Los 
Angeles program apparently has sunk to new depths. Only forward Andre White is 
returning and the Golden Eagles will rely mostly on transfers, such as forward 
LaVar Ball from Washington State and guard Darron Jackson from El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
NAIA 
</P>
<P>
In the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, Southern California College 
was ranked No. 19 in a preseason poll and looms as the team to beat for the 
District 3 title, although Westmont and Biola are also strong contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California made giant strides by going 29-5 and winning the Golden 
State Athletic Conference last season. The only element missing was a district 
title and berth in the NAIA national tournament, goals which appear within 
reach this season. 
</P>
<P>
Back are all-district center Jeff Bickmore and forwards Terry Scruggs and John 
Mounce. The Vanguards also added a top junior college prospect in guard Elbert 
Davis from Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
With no seniors, Westmont will have one of its youngest teams. Even so, the 
Warriors, who finished 18-13 and reached the district semifinals last season, 
still expect to excel in district play. Top players include junior forwards 
Peter Partain and Noel Matthews and junior guards Chris Brown and Chad 
Kammerer, whose father Chet has coached Westmont for 24 seasons and has a 
475-230 record. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new coach at Biola this season, although he is hardly a stranger to 
the school. Howard Lyon returns to the school at which he built a 401-143 
record and won five District 3 titles in 17 seasons. He has his work cut out, 
though, with no starters returning from a team that was 29-8 and won the 
district title. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon will rely largely on transfers such as 6-9 center Jeff Baker, forward Tim 
Ericksen, swing man Jeffrey Lee and guard Kellie McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's reached the .500 mark in its first season under Coach Mel 
Hankinson last season and, with its top players returning and the addition of 
key transfers, the program appears on the way up. The Mustangs, 15-15 last 
season, have top scorers Tom Bruner and Jason Webster at forward and also add 
NCAA Division I transfers guard Damon Greer from San Jose State and 6-8 center 
Dan Jarms from Eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Layton, second-year coach of Azusa Pacific, was in an unaccustomed 
position when his team finished at 12-19 last season. It marked the first time 
in his nine-year career that he had coached a losing team. 
</P>
<P>
That should not become a trend, though, since Layton has forward Michael Benton 
and point guard Titus Randle back, and transfers Patrick McMann from Northern 
Arizona and Jeff Hester from Portland, both 6-8 forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist has posted two consecutive 20-win seasons, but with only one senior 
on the roster and with Warren Daniels and David Solomons the only players 
returning from last year's team, the Lancers may struggle to approach their 
recent success. Cal Baptist will also rely on forwards Jon Gorzeman and Jim 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
It figures to be a transition season for Cal Lutheran, too. There is a new 
coach, former USC assistant Mike Dunlap, and graduation took guard Steve 
deLaveaga, the all-time scoring leader. The Kingsmen may have a worthy 
replacement in guard Jeff deLaveaga -- Steve's brother who redshirted last 
season. Cal Lutheran, 11-17 last year, will also count heavily on returning 
center Mike Demeter. 
</P>
<P>
There is nowhere to go but up for Christ College Irvine, which was 0-14 in the 
Golden State Athletic Conference and 4-26 overall last season. The Eagles will 
be improved with the return of guards Aaron Clasen and Albert Gay and forward 
Keith Rogers, and the addition of high-scoring transfer Kevin Kurz at forward, 
although victories will still be in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
SCIAC 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Pomona-Pitzer 
has the personnel to repeat as conference champion, although transfer-heavy La 
Verne and traditional power Claremont-Mudd-Scripps should also contend. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest surprises last season was Pomona-Pitzer, which won the SCIAC 
title with a 9-1 record, finished 18-10 overall and reached the Division III 
playoffs under first-year Coach Charles Katsiaficas. 
</P>
<P>
With seven lettermen returning, a repeat performance would not be surprising. 
The Sagehens are led by forwards Jared Holum and James Johnson and have adept 
outside shooters in guards Reed Porter and David Todd. 
</P>
<P>
It might be too much to expect La Verne to go from worst to first in one 
season. But with the influx of outstanding transfers, the Leopards will not 
look anything like the team that was 0-10 in the SCIAC and 5-21 overall last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list is forward Andre Purry from Cal State Long Beach. Others 
include forwards Deshang Weaver and John Jackson and guard Shaun Manning. The 
top player returning is All-SCIAC guard Lamont Landers. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps usually falls among the leaders in the SCIAC race and 
this season should be no exception. The Stags, who finished second in the SCIAC 
at 7-3 and 14-11 overall last season, have excellent front-line players in 
center Henry Albrecht and forwards John Gilliland and Chris Greene. A key will 
be how fast the team's inexperienced guards develop. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a tall order to stop Occidental with the return of All-SCIAC 
performer Chris Anderson, 6-9, and John Crowley, 6-8, in the team's double-post 
offense. The Tigers, who were 15-10 and tied Redlands for third in the SCIAC 
last season, also have starters Ethan Caldwell at point guard and Brett Dennis 
at forward. 
</P>
<P>
Although it might not be the best team in the SCIAC, Redlands could be the most 
entertaining. The Bulldogs averaged a Division III-leading 100.3 points and 
10.4 three-pointers last season, when they finished 15-10. The outlook is 
similar, despite the graduation of All-SCIAC forward Perry Bellaire. Redlands 
has two returning starters in swing man Robert Stone and forward Darryl 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
With no starter taller than 6-4 and five of its top six players from last 
season's 11-15 squad having graduated, Whittier could have problems ahead. The 
Poets will count on forward Whalen Elmore, the only starter returning, and 
guards David Hune and Chris Seibert, both excellent outside shooters. 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENT 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino, a Division III independent that finished 20-6 and 
reached the playoffs last season, will have difficulty replacing graduated 
All-American center Mark Warren and all-region forward Gerald Duncan. Even so, 
the outlook is bright with the return of guards Dave Webb and Troy Adams and 
forward Greg Rowe, plus an excellent recruiting class.

TUBBS WINS FOURTH IN ROW ON DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: FORMER WBA HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION BEATS ORLIN NORRIS AT SANTA MONICA 
CIVIC AUDITORIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former World Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion Tony Tubbs won his fourth 
consecutive fight by winning a close, but unanimous, decision over Orlin Norris 
Tuesday night at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs, who earned $12,000 -- compared to the $800,000 he earned against Mike 
Tyson when he was knocked out five fights ago -- won Norris' North American 
Boxing Federation heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
In another championship fight on the card, Terry Norris, Orlin Norris' brother, 
defended his NABF light-middleweight title with a unanimous decision over Tony 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-rounder, Olympian Anthony Hembrick, 9-0 as a professional 
light-heavyweight, decisioned Matthew Brooks. Hembrick was the U.S. 
middleweight who missed the bus to his first bout at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 
and was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
The Norris-Montgomery 12-rounder had nearly put some spectators to sleep when 
the best action of the card happened in the 12th round, after the two fighters 
traded low blows. 
</P>
<P>
Norris hit Montgomery squarely in the groin with a left hook, doubling up 
Montgomery. Referee Vince Delgado gave Montgomery more than a minute to 
recover. Seconds after the fighters resumed, Montgomery hit Norris in the groin 
with a right hand and Delgado immediately deducted a point from Montgomery's 
score, which by that point wasn't much. 
</P>
<P>
Both fighters raised the fury level, and the wild action over the last 90 
seconds brought the crowd to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
The judges had Norris winning easily, the closest score being 117-107. 
</P>
<P>
Hembrick showed a lot of movement -- much of it seemingly unnecessary -- and a 
strong, jolting left jab that kept his slower opponent at bay for all six 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The State Athletic Commission had rejected the first three opponents matchmaker 
Merlin Petit had proposed for Hembrick before settling on Brooks, a left-handed 
main eventer from Houston who came in with a 9-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Hembrick, 6-feet-2 and 175 pounds, established boxing superiority at the 
outset, peppering Brooks with his long left jab and trailing right hands. 
</P>
<P>
There were no knockdowns, but Brooks (179) was in bad trouble in the third, 
when Hembrick caught him on the ropes and drilled him with an overhand right to 
the jaw. He didn't follow up, however, and while Hembrick stood there and 
watched Brooks wobble on the ropes, referee Ernie Swanke stepped in and gave 
him an eight-count. 
</P>
<P>
Hembrick seemed bent on finishing Brooks at the outset of the fourth, but 
Brooks rocked him with a left in close, delivering a message to Hembrick that 
the fight was not about to end. 
</P>
<P>
The fans started to boo when action slowed in the fifth and sixth rounds, when 
it was apparent Hembrick couldn't finish his man. In fact, Brooks got in the 
last lick just before the final bell. He hit Hembrick with a thumping left hand 
as the bout ended . . . and sneered defiantly as Hembrick walked to his corner.

NEVER TOO YOUNG FOR SAFETY LESSONS; 
</P>
<P>
HUNTING: DFG PROGRAM PROVIDES MANY YOUNGSTERS WITH FIRST EXPERIENCE UNDER 
CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hunter, stepping carefully through brush with shotgun ready, follows dog into 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Dog comes to point. Pulse pounding, hunter turns in direction indicated. 
Pheasant flushed and takes flight. Hunter raises stock to shoulder, flicks off 
safety, takes careful aim . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's a familiar fall tableau, especially for the dog. Jake, an 11-year-old 
English pointer, has flushed more pheasants than the hunter probably will ever 
see. But it's all new for Sara Autry of Chino, who is only two years older than 
Jake. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of 109 people 17 and younger who got dressed up in bright orange 
vests provided by the California Department of Fish and Game last weekend to 
celebrate graduation from the state's hunter-safety program with a free 
pheasant shoot at Raahauge's hunting ranch in Norco. 
</P>
<P>
There was a similar program at Blythe the same day, and others are scheduled 
from San Jacinto to Lone Pine through December, including another at Raahauge's 
Dec. 2. The purpose is to give young hunters their first field experience under 
controlled conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A DFG press release called them "young adults," but that was stretching it in 
some cases. Zachary Morse of Norco was only 9, and others appeared to be even 
younger. All carried guns -- some as long as the youngsters were tall. All had 
live ammunition. All were licensed hunters. All got home safely. Most got their 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
There was no cause for alarm, said Capt. Rick Wheeler, the warden who is 
coordinator of hunter education for the 10 Southern California counties in DFG 
Region 5. 
</P>
<P>
"We put this under the most controlled situation that we possibly can," Wheeler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hunters, a guide and a dog were assigned to designated fields, far enough 
apart that harmful shots couldn't reach an adjacent area. Only one hunter at a 
time was allowed to load, and then only one shell. The DFG provided two birds 
per hunter, Raahauge's donated 300 more for its two hunts and guides planted 
them in the field immediately before each pair of hunters went out, giving them 
maximum opportunity for success. 
</P>
<P>
"It also allows us to look at them in the field," Wheeler said. "Maybe a number 
of them are doing something wrong. But we haven't had any accidents. The junior 
hunters as a group are very mature." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, they may have a better grasp of what hunting in Southern 
California will be like in the 21st Century. Shrinking habitat and challenged 
morality are rapidly changing the face of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the adults are used to, on a Saturday morning, grabbing a dog and 
going out to a field near the house and hunting," Wheeler said. "Those days are 
over. (With) the mass of population in Southern California, the habitat is not 
what it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Raahauge's leases 3,400 acres of flood-control land along the Santa Ana River, 
2,500 for pheasant hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably the largest pheasant-hunting club in the United States," 
proprietor Mike Raahauge said. "We shoot about 46,000 birds a year." 
</P>
<P>
If that is to be Southern California's pheasant hunting of the future, the next 
generation of hunters doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all they know, so they're showing the same enthusiasm," Wheeler said. 
"They have a very good grasp of what's going on (with the) environment and 
conservation. Then you have some (older) hunters so set in their ways that they 
don't understand times have changed. Especially in Southern California, as 
crowded as it is, if you don't compromise, you lose your position. That's one 
of the neat things about bringing on new hunters." 
</P>
<P>
According to the DFG, hunter numbers have dropped from 700,000 to 400,000 in 
the last seven years. Wheeler thinks part of the reason is fewer new hunters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a high incidence of divorce in Southern California and, normally, the 
mother takes control of the children," Wheeler said. "For the most part, 
females have not been exposed to hunting, so their children can't be exposed to 
hunting, so we're losing a group of potential hunters that won't have the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
At some stage, potential young hunters also may have to face the peer pressure 
of anti-hunting attitudes that are gaining political strength -- a difficult 
experience at an impressionable age. 
</P>
<P>
Some already have. One parent said that when his son wrote a report on what he 
did on vacation -- hunt -- his teacher ridiculed him in front of the class. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said: "I talk to them about it. It might affect them, and if the child 
in his mind perceives that it is wrong, I'm not going to try to change his 
mind. I will tell him that, given a certain set of circumstances and the 
environment we have, that hunting is a necessary tool in conservation. If he 
wishes to believe that, more power to him." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-hunters may accuse the DFG of brainwashing kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect them not to call that brainwashing, because I don't call what 
they do brainwashing," Wheeler said. "When we reach the point that people are 
not allowed to have their opinion, we'd better back off and take another look 
at the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Morse, Zachary's father, said: "We've talked about it but not a whole lot. 
I haven't wanted to give him any of the negative aspects of it. Generally, the 
people that are anti-hunting aren't aware of the whole situation . . . that 
hunters have supported wildlife over many years through their contributions and 
the (conservation) work they do." 
</P>
<P>
Morse said his son has been tagging along for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun just to be out together," he said. "It helps teach respect for the 
animals . . . to learn their habits. It doesn't matter if you get anything. The 
hunting is just the reason. It's a benefit if you're able to put something on 
the table to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Phillips, 12, of Downey said: "They don't sell pheasant in the markets. 
You've gotta go out and hunt 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Each youngster needed to be accompanied by a parent. For most, it was a father. 
Phillips was there with his mother, Irene, a lifelong hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong?" she asked, looking around. "Don't any women hunt anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
Sara Autry will be one. She already has a sound hunting ethic, largely fostered 
by her grandfather, Bud Clinton of Anaheim, who taught her to safely handle a 
single-shot .22 when she was 8. She isn't too squeamish to clean her own game. 
She cleaned about 100 fish on a large family outing last summer. 
</P>
<P>
She got her 20-gauge Winchester for her 10th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my friends didn't believe that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the wisdom and idiom of her 13 years, she said: "People have been hunting, 
like, forever, not just to kill but to survive. Whatever I catch, I'm gonna 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters were given the same safety course adult hunters must take to get 
a license. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tougher because you're dealing with a youngster who may not understand 
all the words," Wheeler said. "But we don't compromise the program because of a 
child's age. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids all show a healthy respect for firearms. You won't have the 
shooting accident in the home after the classes they've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Raahauge said: "Just the world we live in, I think everybody ought to take a 
hunter-safety course. There are guns everywhere. People ought to be familiar 
with them, even if they never shoot 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Before the hunt, Raahauge cautioned: "Let those birds get up and way over your 
head before you start shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler reminded them -- probably for the umpteenth time: "Ninety-nine percent 
of hunting accidents are not accidents. They're pure stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Before driving to the fields, guide Del Pettengill reminded all: "Chambers 
open." 
</P>
<P>
The one-day course covers outdoor survival, how to clean game and the safe 
handling of a weapon -- unloaded in a vehicle (that's the law) and when 
climbing through a fence or over awkward obstacles. And the safety on at all 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for you to take that safety off that firearm until you're 
absolutely ready to take the shot," Wheeler said. "It's like wearing seat 
belts. If you're taught young enough that that's accepted procedure, you won't 
have a problem with it in later life. 
</P>
<P>
"You keep the finger outside the trigger guard and up alongside the stock of 
the weapon. When it comes times to shoot, the finger comes down and hits the 
safety and follows on through to hit the trigger. If you teach 'em that from 
Day 1, they get real good at it. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that will delay that shot will give you a little bit more time to 
look and see what's going on. You want the bird to get up and clear the dog. So 
you spook the bird, the bird flies, you bring your finger down and click off 
the safety, you put your finger on the trigger. By that time the bird has 
cleared the dog and also is committed into which way he's gonna go fly -- in a 
safe direction or not." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler wasn't concerned about the few girls in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is about a female hunter, but she seems to be more 
meticulous and very serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before entering the field, Clinton reminded his granddaughter: "Remember, left 
foot forward, boxer's stance . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I know, Grandpa," Sara replied. 
</P>
<P>
Lining up her first pheasant along the barrel, she took all of the lessons into 
account. Gun up, safety off, track -- bang. 
</P>
<P>
Feathers flew. It all happened very fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty cool," she said afterward. "Pretty cool."

DESORMEAUX NEARS MAIN GOAL, NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT HOW GOOD HE CAN BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maryland racing fans who have followed the career of Kent Desormeaux from the 
beginning will feel like proud parents when the 19-year-old makes history in 
the next few days. He has already ridden 537 winners this year, most of them at 
Laurel and Pimlico, and he needs 10 more to set an all-time record. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux's one goal in 1989 was to break the mark of 546 winners that Chris 
McCarron set in 1974, and he has worked single-mindedly to achieve it. But he 
hasn't decided where he wants to go or what he wants to do thereafter. He has 
contemplated moving to New York, moving to California, or simply staying in the 
comfortable confines of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he doesn't get to ride in as many rich stakes races in Maryland as 
he would in those racing centers, he will still earn more than $700,000 this 
year, so there is no pressing need for him to endure the stress and risks of 
trying to establish himself against tougher competition. 
</P>
<P>
But just as parents must one day tell their young to leave home and face the 
world, so may Desormeaux's admirers here say: Kent, get out of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing left for him to accomplish here. And if he stays, he is 
unlikely to fulfill his enormous potential. 
</P>
<P>
Jockeys rarely come along with the natural gifts that Desormeaux possesses. He 
has an uncanny sense of racing tactics and always seems to put his horse in the 
optimal position. Maryland bettors have come to assume that when there is 
little speed in a field, Desormeaux will be on or near the lead; when there is 
a hot early pace, Desmormeaux will be swooping past the leaders in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
And he somehow makes horses respond to his touch. On the day before the 
Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park, Desormeaux found himself in the unfamiliar 
position of riding a 99-to-1 shot, a fainthearted creature who always weakened 
in sprint races and now was going a mile and one-sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
For just about any other jockey, such a horse would barrel to the front, open a 
big lead and collapse. For Desormeaux, the long shot immediately relaxed, 
settled down behind the leaders and rallied through the stretch to win -- 
something he had never done in his life. Sometimes the kid seems to be endowed 
with magical powers as well as good judgment. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, I wrote a series of columns rating all the jockeys in Maryland, 
and scrutinized the head-on films of every race over a six-week period to do 
it. I watched the nuances of Desormeaux's day-to-day performance, and I was 
convinced he was ready to move into the jockey colony at Santa Anita or Belmont 
and compete with the best in the world. But as I watch his day-to-day 
performance in Maryland now, I haven't see any appreciable improvement in his 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
It is too easy for Desormeaux to dominate his rivals here. The Maryland jockey 
colony is better than it used to be, but this is still a place where cautious 
veterans like Mario Pino can rank in the top 10. In such an environment it 
would be easy, almost natural, for a rider of Desormeaux's talent to grow 
complacent. 
</P>
<P>
In those 1988 articles I noted that one of Desormeaux's few weaknesses was his 
slowness to recognize track biases. On the first two days of the Laurel season 
last month, the rail was so disadvantageous that even dimwitted jockeys were 
avoiding it -- but Desormeaux seemed oblivious to the conditions. He hasn't 
improved in one area that clearly needed improving. He has been riding more 
recklessly than he used to, drawing six suspensions during the year; he is so 
accustomed to winning that he acts as if he expects his rivals to get out of 
the way when he is trying to bull his way through. 
</P>
<P>
The Chris McCarron of 1974 felt as confident in his own skills and the 
inevitability of his own success as Desormeaux does now. But because purse 
money in Maryland was so poor in those days, he didn't hesitate to leave the 
state and set out for California. And as he started to ride against rivals like 
Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay Jr., he learned how much he didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
"I won all those races back in Maryland because I had the God-given talent to 
get horses to run for me," McCarron said. "But it wasn't till I came out here 
and had been riding for three years that I felt I had any finesse or knew the 
finer aspects of riding." 
</P>
<P>
That's the only way Desormeaux will reach his potential -- to ride on a 
day-to-day basis against jockeys like McCarron and Pincay in the West, or 
against Cordero and Santos in the East. He shouldn't be content to amass an 
imposing set of statistics and put his name in the record books; he should set 
out to discover just how good a jockey he can be.

East German athletes who reach a certain age will be allowed to transfer abroad 
starting in January, and those staying at home will have professional contracts 
with their clubs, an East German newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Eichler, president of the East German Sports Federation, said that the 
minimum age for going abroad might be 28, although the precise limit remains to 
be set.

Basketball Coach Bill Frieder of Arizona State said that junior forward Sam 
Mack will remain under indefinite suspension from the team until a 
sexual-assault complaint filed against him can be reviewed by athletic 
department officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Maricopa County Attorney's office said that it would not prosecute Mack in 
the case because of insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, 19, was accused in the alleged rape of an 18-year-old female in a campus 
dormitory room rented by two Sun Devil players Nov. 5. Frieder suspended Mack 
three days later, but Mack was allowed to stay in school and keep his 
scholarship.

AMI TO MOVE ITS HEADQUARTERS FROM BEVERLY HILLS TO DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
American Medical International, saddled with debt from a $1.67-billion buyout 
completed in October, said Tuesday that it will leave its home in Beverly Hills 
for a more economical headquarters in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 employees in Beverly Hills will be affected by the move, which is to 
take place next September, the company said. Unaffected are another 200 
employees who work at AMI's data center near Marina del Rey and in insurance 
and benefits units in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The move will help foster "a new corporate culture that is reflective of the 
new AMI," Harry J. Gray, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The 
"new AMI, company officials have previously indicated, will stress leanness, 
given the debt burden resulting from its buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"Relocating our corporate headquarters to the Dallas area is prudent from 
economic, geographic and philosophic perspectives," Gray said. "Dallas 
represents significant cost savings over Beverly Hills. It is more central in 
relation to our hospitals, which are located across the Sun Belt." AMI 
officials said recently that the company would sell its 23 foreign hospitals 
and an undetermined number of its 48 U.S. hospitals to reduce debt. Other 
cost-cutting moves were announced then, including the intent to reduce the 
1,500-member administrative staff. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 employees in the Beverly Hills office were laid off recently, an AMI 
spokeswoman said. The company said it is developing incentive programs for 
employees offered a transfer to Dallas and would help place other employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret that this move means we will lose many valued employees," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
AMI, founded in Los Angeles in 1956, was a pioneer of the for-profit hospital 
industry. It moved to Beverly Hills in 1973. Burdened by debt and squeezed by 
cost cutting in the federal Medicaid program in the 1980s, however, AMI and its 
competitors fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The company was attempting a turnaround when it received a buyout offer in 
March. After a bidding contest, IMA Acquisition Corp., formed by First Boston 
Corp., Gray, and Mel Klein &amp; Partners -- a firm backed by Chicago's wealthy 
Pritzker family -- acquired the company in a deal valued at $1.67 billion, the 
second-most-costly buyout in the health-care industry.

NISSAN WILL INVEST $1 BILLION TO EXPAND ITS MEXICO PLANT 
</P>

<P>
Nissan Corp. has agreed to invest $1 billion during the next three years to 
expand its vehicle manufacturing operations in Aguascalientes, Mexican trade 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The commitment represents the largest single foreign investment package in 
Mexico unveiled during 1989, said Gregory Leddy, a New York-based spokesman for 
the Mexican Secretariat of Trade and Industrial Development. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Leddy noted, Ford Motor Co. announced a one-year, 
$300-million expansion of its plant in Hermosillo. Meantime, Nestle, the 
Swiss-based multinational giant, also revealed a fresh $300-million investment 
in its Mexico operations, Leddy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nissan announcement comes at a time when Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari has been aggressively seeking to encourage foreign investment from 
Japan and other nations. In May, the Mexican government eased restrictions on 
overseas investors, allowing international investors to have 100% ownership of 
a wide range of manufacturing and service industry businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Mexico has been discarding its traditional suspicion of 
foreign investment. That suspicion was the product of intense nationalism here, 
but officials now say such attitudes are unrealistic if Mexico is to pull out 
of the economic crisis that has gripped the nation since prices for Mexican oil 
began falling in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Mexico City, Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's secretary 
of trade and development, called Nissan's investment "a significant endorsement 
of the long-term potential of the Mexican economy." 
</P>
<P>
The trade secretary recently returned from a seven-day investment promotion 
visit to Japan, where he said officials of Nissan confirmed their decision to 
expand the plant in Aguascalientes. The city is about 300 miles northwest of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, Nissan now produces about 100,000 vehicles annually, including cars, 
pickup trucks and vans, said Leddy, the spokesman for the Mexican trade 
ministry. Most are marketed in Mexico, but others are exported to two dozen 
nations, mostly in Latin America. It was unclear if the additional investment 
was designed to expand into other export markets, such as the United States and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Nissan in Mexico could not be reached for comment. In September, 
however, Nissan announced in Tokyo a plan to reduce exports from Japan, 
increase overseas production and expand imports to Japan, including finished 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan also plans to expand its plant in Smyrna, Tenn., which now builds both 
Sentra subcompacts and light trucks, in order to produce a second passenger car 
line there by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Through September, 1989, according to government figures, there was $26.08 
billion in approved foreign investment in Mexico. More than 8,000 foreign firms 
have established operations here. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has expressed hopes that foreign investment will double 
to more than $50 billion in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States accounts for the largest share of overseas investment, 62% of 
the total, according to government figures. It is followed by the United 
Kingdom (7.3%), West Germany (6.6%) and Japan (5.5 %). The Japanese investment 
is rising as quickly, however, reflecting that nation's emergence as a national 
economic power. 
</P>
<P>
There are 179 Mexican companies with direct Japanese investment, mostly in 
manufacturing, the government says. Among the other Japanese firms with 
operations in Mexico are Sony, Matsushita, Mitsubishi and Casio. A number of 
Japanese firms have established border plants as part of the joint U.S.-Mexican 
maquiladora program, which provides tariff breaks for material assembled or 
manufactured for the export market, usually the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the level of Japanese investment in Mexico . . . will 
increase substantially in the very near future," Serra Puche said.

PRICES RISE 0.5% IN OCTOBER AS INFLATION JUMPS; 
</P>

<P>
Consumer prices jumped 0.5% in October, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, 
providing a reminder that -- after several months of remission -- inflation 
again has surfaced. It is running at an annual rate of about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The October increase in the consumer price index reflected a rebound in food 
and gasoline prices after declines last summer, as well as seasonal increases 
in automobile and clothing prices. 
</P>
<P>
But economists noted that price appreciation was evident throughout the 
economy. The underlying inflation rate, derived by excluding food and energy 
costs, also was 0.5% in October. 
</P>
<P>
More ominously, perhaps, inflation in the service sector, which now represents 
nearly 55% of the economy, rose 0.5% as well. The gain in services was paced by 
a 0.7% increase in medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, according to economists, is that consumer price inflation 
seems to have become entrenched at an annual rate of 4.5% to 5% and probably 
will not fall below that level even if the economy slumps. So far this year, 
consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of 4.6%, compared to the 4.4% 
price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consumer prices for goods and services 
fell 0.1% before seasonal adjustment, compared to an unadjusted increase of 
0.5% nationally. In September, metropolitan area prices jumped 0.9%, compared 
to 0.3% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the nation's inflation climbed to an annual pace of nearly 9% 
as food and energy prices jumped, and other commodity prices rose by lesser 
amounts. Those trends were reversed last summer, however, and inflation fell to 
an annual rate of 1.6% in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, we've been talking about ups and downs in commodity prices," noted 
Stacy Kottman, a member of a Georgia State University forecasting unit that 
concentrates on price movements. "But next year, as commodity prices settle 
down, we are going to be reading about service prices and employment cost 
inflation. Services are already running at 4.8% over the past year, higher than 
the 4.5% overall." 
</P>
<P>
October's price gains also reflected seasonal increases in auto prices; these 
rose 0.6% in October as new models appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Kottman, however, said he expects energy and auto prices to moderate in coming 
months. "If you walk into showrooms, you see a lot of bored car salesmen; so 
new car prices will likely be given back in incentives next month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices jumped 1% after a 1.7% gain in September. Roger Brinner, an 
economist with Data Resources in Lexington, Mass., said higher clothing prices 
are setting up "another game of chicken" between consumers and retailers, a 
pattern likely to affect other goods between now and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"As in recent years, we'll probably see soft sales from retailers until the 
discounts go on at the end of the Christmas buying season," Brinner said. 
"Nowadays, you can get high price or high volume for most retail goods -- but 
you can't get both." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York, said 
retail markups reflect "businesses trying to gather rosebuds in the form of 
higher prices while they may," a trend that could be reversed in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers see profits falling and costs rising, so they're trying to get 
prices up before the economy slows so much they can't do it at all," Kellner 
said. "But it's likely most car price increases will get reversed, and nervous 
retailers before Christmas will likely flatten apparel prices also." 
</P>
<P>
But even if retail goods begin to soften, the service economy is still 
experiencing significant inflation, Kellner said. Service gains reflect higher 
employment expenses, primarily health benefits, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the increases in health-care costs have become something of a flywheel 
for service sector inflation in general. The 0.7% increase in medical-care 
costs in October followed an increase of 0.8% in September and four consecutive 
monthly gains of 0.7%. Medical costs are up 8.1% from a year ago, and they have 
increased at an annual rate of 8.8% over the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustments, the consumer price index rose by 0.6 points to 
125.6 in October from a 1982-84 base of 100. In other words, a selected 
cross-section of consumer goods and services that cost $100 during the base 
period now costs $125.60.

WITH NEW PRODUCTS BOOSTING SALES, TURKEY FARMERS HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

They have been tossed from low-flying airplanes in an odd Arkansas ritual, 
bowled frozen down the aisles of an Orange County supermarket, adopted as pets 
and hijacked as political pawns. 
</P>
<P>
They have been ridiculed as too dumb to live and found to be too fat to 
procreate unassisted. They are a strutting symbol of suffering stupidity, and 
yet we invite them to dine with us in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The turkey's time has come, and we're not just talking Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
When processors started turning out various turkey products in the 1970s -- 
turkey bologna, turkey pastrami, turkey kielbasa, ham and hot dogs -- the 
bird's fate was sealed as one of America's fastest-growing foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are really happening out there," said Mervin Amerine, manager of the 
California Turkey Industry Board. "We're moving in on the other animal protein 
items -- beef, pork, you name it. We keep getting their business all the time." 
</P>
<P>
When consumers want beef or pork these days, they're often gobbling up turkey 
instead -- and at a rate that's turned it from holiday fare into everyday 
eating. In fact, the Thanksgiving-through-New Year's Day turkey glut now 
accounts for only about 35% of the total turkey market, said Laurie Wilson, 
National Turkey Federation spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't lost the holiday image," Wilson said. "We've just added on." 
</P>
<P>
While the turkey has such a secure position in American mythology and cuisine, 
there is relatively little known about the bird for certain. One solid fact is 
that the plastic-packaged fowl has its roots in the native American wild 
turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, which roamed the forests from southern Canada to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The bird was brought from Mexico to Europe in the 1500s by the Spaniards. 
Merchants from the eastern Mediterranean, often Turks, usually touched down in 
Seville on their way west and are thought to have picked the bird up there and 
introduced it to England. The English, it is said, named it the "turkie cock," 
though it was called everything from the "cock of India" to the "elephant bird" 
throughout the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the question of whether the Pilgrims actually ate the bird at the 
first Thanksgiving back in 1621. 
</P>
<P>
William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, allegedly described a 
turkeyless feast in his personal notes, listing venison, duck and goose among 
the menu items. Some historians contend, however, that the Indians brought the 
birds to the potluck dinner or that Pilgrim hunters went out and shot a few 
before bowing their heads over grace. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, turkey eating had a slow start in the United States, a situation 
that showed no improvement for more than three centuries. By 1930, Americans 
were eating a mere 1 1/2 pounds of turkey each year -- about enough for a 
drumstick or two on Thanksgiving Day, followed by a sandwich and a plate of 
Turkey a la king during the post-holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Turkey Federation, consumption grew slowly but 
steadily for about 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then 1980 hit. That year, Americans ate 10.4 pounds apiece; in 1988, it was up 
to 16.1 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The turkey federation predicts per-capita consumption to reach nearly 18 pounds 
by 1990. Consumers in California are already eating 23 pounds each year -- more 
than any other area of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Health is a major reason for the switch. The decade that brought us aerobics 
and lycra tights, that saw alcohol consumption take a plunge and gym 
memberships rise, also taught us about the dangers of cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, people are perceiving turkey as a low-fat, low-calorie alternative for 
red meat products," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: A three-ounce portion of roasted white turkey meat contains 119 
calories, one gram of fat, 55 milligrams of cholesterol and 26 grams of 
protein. The same-sized serving of a beef rib roast has 217 calories, 12.9 
grams of fat, 68 milligrams of cholesterol and 24 grams of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey processors were quick to catch on that the way into Americans' stomachs 
is through unclogged arteries. Tom Herrick is generally credited as being the 
father of turkey ham, a product he seasoned into being in 1974 when he was 
general manager of a Turlock, Calif., turkey processing company. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the Louis Rich Co. introduced turkey bologna, salami and 
pastrami to the sandwich-eating public. Last June, turkey bacon made its debut 
in American frying pans, thanks to Con-Agra Turkey Co., producers of the Turkey 
Selects by Armour label. 
</P>
<P>
Why did it take 15 years for turkey to metamorphose from drumstick to breakfast 
strip? Robert Wangerien, director of marketing for ConAgra's Turlock Division, 
figures it's a combination of technology and taste. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a little bit of more technology on the part of the manufacturers to 
make a turkey breakfast strip," Wangerien said. "And now there's greater and 
greater consumer demand for products that are healthful, lower in fat and more 
nutritious in general. And there's a greater awareness of turkey." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s also taught turkey processors that small is beautiful. Instead of 
just offering a frozen 20-pound Tom, they began to cut turkeys up like chickens 
and offer turkey cutlets and tenderloin, legs, thighs, breasts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to growing more turkeys, farmers are also growing different 
turkeys, birds selectively bred to carry more meat. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours are broad-breasted turkey, and it's a genetic thing, a development 
through the years," said Joyce Wesolowski, general coordinator at Willie Bird 
Turkeys in Petaluma. "They have developed the turkey to where we get very, very 
large hens. When they get too big, they'll topple over, because they're too 
heavy on the breast." 
</P>
<P>
Increased weight also makes breeding the birds more difficult, industry experts 
say, so turkey breeders rely on artificial insemination and trickery to 
increase mating. 
</P>
<P>
Left to their own devices, turkeys would breed earlier in the year than optimal 
for mass production and holiday sales. So some turkey producers keep the birds 
in darkened sheds. When light is suddenly let in, the birds think it's spring 
and nature takes its course. 
</P>
<P>
But then, turkeys were never known for their native intelligence. Their major 
activities consist of eating and sleeping; young turkeys have been known to 
stand in the rain with their heads up and mouths open until they drown. 
</P>
<P>
But some turkey owners would beg to differ when it comes to talking turkey 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur, a Wisconsin Tom, made national news when his owner decided not to eat 
him for Thanksgiving in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? After eight months in the home of Bob Fecteau, Wilbur had taken up 
jogging, his owner insisted. It was proof, Fecteau said, of turkeys' kinship 
with humans. Fecteau ate ham for his holiday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
He's not the only American who has spent time with a turkey in activities 
outside of raising, cooking and eating. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Johnson, for one, has created the Poultry Bowling Assn. to promote a 
sport he dreamed up while stocking shelves. The Santa Ana grocery clerk was 
watching workers in the meat department slide a Butterball across the linoleum 
one Thanksgiving a few years back when he realized how fast and accurate the 
bird was in its frozen state. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, turkey bowling was born -- a new, late-night indoor sport. To 
play, stack 2-liter plastic soda pop bottles at the end of the grocery aisle. 
Grip the Butterball by its yellow handle, wind up and slide. But 
Swift-Eckerich, the Chicago-based maker of the Butterball, has said it is not 
amused. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, members of Farm Sanctuary, a Delaware-based animal rights 
group, took six turkeys on the road for a kind of protest of fowl treatment and 
delivered them to families in Cincinnati, Boulder, Colo., and Camarillo -- 
families that promised not to braise the beasts. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to be aware that animals have feelings, at least feelings of 
pain," said Linda Callahan, a Camarillo resident whose back yard became the 
home of Trotter and Strutter at the end of their trip West. 
</P>
<P>
Farm Sanctuary would almost certainly question the motives of the Yellville 
city fathers. In Yellville, Ark., wild turkeys, which can fly better than their 
domestic cousins, are thrown from zooming airplanes during the annual Turkey 
Trot Festival in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane flies pretty low over the park, and they throw out the turkeys and 
they fly and people try to catch them," said Joyce Newton, Yellville city 
clerk. "There's a farm nearby, and ones they don't catch usually end up there. 
The farmer has quite a herd of them by now."

KLA Instruments Trims Work Force: KLA Instruments Corp. said it has 
consolidated operations of several divisions resulting in a roughly 7% decrease 
in its worldwide work force of 1,100. The Santa Clara-based maker of industrial 
image automation systems said the cuts reflect continuing efforts to keep 
operations as efficient as possible, "especially in uncertain economic 
periods." The firm said it does not expect the consolidations to have a 
significant effect on second-quarter financial results.

Agreement in Hunts' Bankruptcy: Former billionaire brothers William Herbert 
Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt could emerge from bankruptcy before the end of 
December following a compromise reached by major creditors. As a federal 
bankruptcy judge poised to convert the Chapter 11 bankruptcies of William 
Herbert Hunt to a Chapter 7 liquidation, spokesmen for two creditors, Minpeco 
SA and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York, announced that they agreed 
on settlement terms, which were not disclosed. The bankruptcy judge defered 
signing the order until Dec. 15.

PRESSURE AT AVON BUILDS AS BASS HIKES STAKE 
</P>

Robert M. Bass Group, the Texas takeover concern, said Tuesday that it and 
partners hold 5.9% of embattled Avon Products Inc., and analysts said the stake 
may put further pressure on the cosmetics firm to merge or be taken over. 
</P>
<P>
Avon shares closed up 75 cents at $36.125 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in Avon's shares was heavy, with more than 1 million changing hands, 
and analysts said the Bass statement could heat up any fight for Avon, which 
has vowed to stay independent. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing has been in play since May. More and more of the stock is in fewer 
and fewer hands," said Deepak Raj, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no bid on the table," he added. 
</P>
<P>
An Avon spokesman said Robert Bass had told Avon Chairman James Preston the 
purchases were made "for investment purposes only." 
</P>
<P>
But since at least two other shareholder groups have made overtures about a 
merger or takeover, analysts said the Bass stake would increase pressure on 
Avon management. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a squeeze play," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Investment group Chartwell Partners holds at least a 6.9% stake. It said it may 
propose a merger with the company, but has made no bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Bass group said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that its stake was an investment and that it has had talks with Avon 
management. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, which may continue, were about Avon's recent history and business 
outlook, said the group, the investment vehicle of billionaire Robert Bass of 
Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Bass also said it may hold discussions with other persons, including other Avon 
shareholders. It gave no indication in the filing of what issues might be 
discussed in such talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Bass group is a leading player in corporate takeovers, sometimes profiting 
as a minority shareholder and sometimes acquiring control. Its investments have 
spanned banks, media companies, information groups and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Avon's managers in the past week have publicly reaffirmed their desire to 
retain control after months of takeover speculation that began in May, when 
Amway Corp. made a $39-a-share bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Amway held a 10.3% stake with Minneapolis investor Irwin A. Jacobs, who raised 
this to a "possible price" of $41 a share, or $2.2 billion, on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Avon, the leading U.S. direct marketer of cosmetics, jewelry and personal 
products, turned down both offers.

United Airlines, the second-biggest U.S. airline, said Tuesday that it is 
raising fares on a broad range of domestic flights and rival carriers said they 
may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Trans World Airlines Inc. alone matched the hikes immediately and analysts said 
that if just one big carrier opts to stick with present fares, the 
revenue-raiser will collapse. 
</P>
<P>
United said it plans to raise full-fare, one-way first class tickets by $8 and 
full-fare, one-way coach tickets by $5 in most of the 48 continental states 
beginning Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based United, a subsidiary of UAL Corp., also said it is raising prices 
by $5 on its discounted one-way tickets that require three, seven and 14-day 
advance purchases. 
</P>
<P>
But the increases, which were fed into United's computer reservation system 
over the weekend, are aimed chiefly at business travelers and do not apply to 
the excursion fares the vast majority of leisure travelers use. 
</P>
<P>
Excursion fares, also known as Maxsavers, typically require round-trip travel, 
a Saturday night stay and 14-day advance purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Of United's competitors, only Trans World Airlines said it has decided to match 
the increases, and did so selectively. 
</P>
<P>
TWA raised its full-fare coach and first class one-way fares by the same 
margins as United but left its advance-purchase fares untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines Inc., USAir Group Inc., AMR Corp. and Eastern Airlines, a 
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., all said they are studying United's move and 
have not yet decided whether to match it.

AEROJET SETTLEMENT OF ARMY OVERCHARGE TO TOTAL $590,000

Aerojet-General Corp. agreed Monday to pay the government $590,000 to settle 
claims that it overcharged the Army on contracts for film display panels, the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet reported the violation to the government under the Defense Department's 
Voluntary Disclosure Program, which encourages contractors to report misconduct 
to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department agreed to take no further action against the company on 
the overcharges. However, the firm still could be temporarily or permanently 
barred from future Pentagon business as a result of its admissions. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts were with an Aerojet subsidiary, Aerojet ElectroSystems Co. of 
Azusa, which improperly charged labor costs to overhead accounts when direct 
payments under the contract were exhausted, according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Aerojet ElectroSystems built thin film display panels, an advanced means of 
displaying data using electroluminescence. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, signed Monday, Aerojet will pay the government 
$278,000 in addition to an earlier payment of $312,000. In addition, the 
company will pay all the costs of investigating and settling the case, the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a new thing . . . this is just the end (payment) of the total 
$590,000," an Aerojet spokeswoman said. "As far as we are concerned, the system 
worked. We found this on a self audit."

EARNINGS: VONS CUTS LOSSES BY 40%, SALES CLIMB 30% 
</P>

Vons Cos., apparently successfully coping with the financial fallout from its 
acquisition of the Southern California operations of Safeway Stores last year, 
reported improved results Tuesday, with third-quarter losses about 40% below 
their levels a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte-based Vons, which acquired 162 Safeway stores in August, 1988, to 
merge into its chain of Vons, Pavilions and Tianguis supermarkets in Southern 
California, reported a net loss of $5.9 million for the 16-week period ended 
Oct. 8, 1989, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million during the third quarter 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased with our progress in integrating the Safeway 
operations," said Roger E. Stangeland, chairman and chief executive of Vons. 
"And we anticipate that our performance will continue to improve as we near 
completion of the integration project." 
</P>
<P>
Vons, the largest supermarket chain in Southern California with 334 stores, 
said sales for the third quarter rose 30% to $1.6 billion. The company also 
announced that it had renovated 68 stores and remodeled 22 of its store 
facilities. During the first three quarters of 1989, Vons opened five new 
stores and closed 21. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted favorably to Vons' financial news, which was released at 
the beginning of trading Tuesday. Vons shares closed at $15, up 62.5 cents on 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Although supermarket rivals Ralphs Grocery Co. and American Stores Co., which 
operates Lucky Stores, are expected to release their quarterly financial 
results later this month, analysts on Tuesday were already predicting that Vons 
was benefiting more from its own good management than any favorable industry 
trends. As a result, many analysts expect Vons to continue to capitalize on its 
acquisition of the 162 Safeway stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The big payoff will come in the next few quarters in terms of accelerating 
results," said Gary M. Giblen, a vice president of Paine Webber. "It's no 
longer a question of 'if' but 'when,' " he said. "Vons made one of the most 
dramatic moves in the history of retailing by doubling their store base with 
the purchase of (Southern California) Safeway. Now they are reaping the 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based food and beverage 
industry consultant, was equally optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched Vons consolidate a lot of their gains and become stronger," he 
said. "Basically these results show they are over the hurdle." JUBE SHIVER Jr.

Caesars World Inc.: The casino hotel company said first-quarter earnings fell 
23% to $17.5 million. Revenue totaled $225.7 million, down 2% from the same 
period a year ago. The Los Angeles-based company said gambling volume increased 
in all three of its hotel casinos. But those gains were more than offset by 
lower overall win percentages, disruptions from expansion programs in Las 
Vegas, higher marketing and payroll costs and a rise in bad debt provisions.

Sony, the Japanese electronics maker that owns CBS Records and Columbia 
Pictures, defied analysts' expectations Tuesday and reported higher six-month 
results amid booming sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for Sony and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled about $340 
million (49.06 billion yen), up from about $202 million (29.18 billion yen) a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose to $8.51 billion (1.229 trillion yen), up 23.8% from $6.88 billion 
(992.260 billion yen) in the comparable year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales continued to make up the largest part of Sony's overall sales in 
the six months. But despite booming personal spending in Japan, Sony marked up 
its strongest sales gains overseas, particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
European sales jumped 30.3% from a year earlier while sales in the United 
States climbed 26.5%. Sales inside Japan increased a more moderate 16%. Sales 
of recordings by Sony's subsidiary CBS Records Inc. rose 18.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"They are good numbers," said industry analyst Darrel Whitten at 
Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan). "Sony is strategically the best-placed 
company to maximize growth with the combination of hardware and software 
markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment for consumer electronics is not like it was two years ago and 
despite that they have done well," said senior analyst Virginia Kouyoumdjian at 
Baring Securities (Japan). "The company is in the right areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only company that has completely integrated operations that will be 
able to market entertainment software and hardware together." 
</P>
<P>
Sony is especially strong in compact discs and came out with the only 
innovative product in the audio area this year, the "Pixie," a high performing 
mini-stereo that can be stacked, lined up or put on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
The maker of the Walkman personal stereo moved into the booming record business 
by purchasing CBS Records in 1988. "CBS has been bought and paid for and is 
contributing nicely to profits," said Prudential Bache's Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
Sony added a new piece of U.S. software, filmmaker Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment, early this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is going to be an impact, perhaps in the fourth quarter and 
first quarter next year," Whitten said of the Columbia purchase. "There should 
not be much more than a six-month squeeze on earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company's long-term outlook is good. "In the long term, it is 
still the most exciting company in the world in consumer electronics. There's 
nothing like it," said Baring's Kouyoumdjian.

BOOKS: AUTHOR STEVE WEINBERG SPENT FIVE YEARS TRYING TO CAPTURE ON PAPER THE 
ELUSIVE INDUSTRIALIST WHO MADE OXY PETROLEUM A GIANT. NOW HIS SUBJECT IS 
FIGHTING TO BANISH THE BOOK. 
</P>

<P>
When 91-year-old industrialist Armand Hammer popped up in the news recently 
because he had a pacemaker installed, he needed no introduction. Anyone who 
turns Occidental Petroleum into a multinational conglomerate, builds an art 
empire, pumps millions of dollars into cancer research and shuttles around the 
world as a citizen-diplomat is sure to be a household name. 
</P>
<P>
With two autobiographies, two authorized biographies and tons of newspaper and 
magazine articles about Hammer on library shelves, his life is an open book. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seems. 
</P>
<P>
But in late 1984, author Steve Weinberg, an associate journalism professor at 
the University of Missouri, decided to get to know Hammer better. Over the next 
five years, Weinberg interviewed about 600 of Hammer's friends, enemies and 
associates and studied "hundreds of thousands" of pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the newly released "Armand Hammer, The Untold Story," a 501-page 
profile that Weinberg said is far too intricate to boil down into any sort of a 
capsule summary. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's attorneys have had no such reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual letter urging publisher Little Brown &amp; Co. to drop the book, 
they argued that "The Untold Story" portrays Hammer "as the scion of a morally 
bankrupt family, who from young adulthood has had a propensity for criminal and 
fraudulent behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"In keeping with such a theme," the letter continued, "the book contains dozens 
of passages impugning (Hammer's) motives, reflecting adversely on his integrity 
and inferring that he is, and has been throughout his life, unscrupulous and 
willing to attain personal goals and ambitions through criminal acts, breaches 
of fiduciary duty or other unconscionable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hammer nor his attorneys would talk to The Times about Weinberg's book. 
</P>
<P>
But in their letter, dated last July, the attorneys stated that the book, which 
Hammer also has moved to keep from being published in Great Britain, is "beyond 
redemption by corrections." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg scoffs at that accusation. In his view, the controversy merely raises 
basic questions facing any biographer: How does one accurately and honestly 
portray the life of another human? 
</P>
<P>
Even before Hammer's best-selling autobiography hit the stores in 1987, 
then-Vice President George Bush, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald 
Ford, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Israeli leader Menachem Begin 
contributed gushing publicity blurbs. So did Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and 
Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
But in an article in Regardie's magazine the year before, Weinberg had written 
that "Hammer has created a persona that sometimes seems to conflict with the 
facts. Without the facts it is hard to know where myth ends and reality begins. 
. . . Many journalists have failed to probe behind Hammer's carefully 
cultivated image. Hammer has preempted the market in information about himself. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was underscored as he set out to research the book, Weinberg 
said. "The Doctor," as everyone calls Hammer, refused to talk; he and his 
associates told others not to talk either, sources who did speak up told 
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everyone who currently draws money from him in any connection said no," 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg is particularly angry that while he was submitting his book proposal 
to various publishing houses, someone violated an unwritten, sacred rule of the 
industry and, he asserts, leaked a copy to Hammer. He also has heard from 
former Hammer associates that The Doctor disliked the article in Regardie's. 
</P>
<P>
"And common sense says it didn't help that I run an organization called 
Investigative Reporters and Editors," said Weinberg, the executive director of 
that respected professional group. 
</P>
<P>
But he remains uncertain why Hammer, who by all accounts relishes publicity, 
was so adamant in attempting to lower a veil of silence on his effort. Still, 
bolstered by a $160,000 advance, Weinberg set out to piece together a portrait 
of a man who didn't want to be portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
With or without Hammer's stamp of approval, the basic threads of his life shake 
out the same in the various biographies. 
</P>
<P>
The differences are in the authors' approach and inclusion of details. 
</P>
<P>
These differences are even reflected in chapter headings. The first chapter of 
the authorized biography, for instance, is titled "Genesis of Genius." The 
first chapter of Weinberg's unauthorized biography is "A Bankrupt Family." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, Weinberg is aggressively timid about drawing 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
He is not, for instance, an admirer of the now popular psycho-historical school 
of biography, as practiced by Gail Sheehy and others: "I don't think a 
biographer should put his subject on the couch any more than necessary. . . . 
We have trouble knowing what our own wife or brother or sister or mother is 
thinking at any time. What presumption would lead me to tell people what Armand 
Hammer is thinking?" 
</P>
<P>
Such protestations aside, Weinberg does juxtapose facts and supply a few 
editorial asides to hint at the psychological forces that shaped Hammer's life 
and set him on the "quest for respect and respectability." 
</P>
<P>
In Weinberg's portrayal, Hammer's father, Julius, was a man who believed 
sincerely in socialism, yet worked hard to support his family as a capitalist, 
managing eight drugstores at one time. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in his investigation, Weinberg unearthed documentation that in 
1906 Julius Hammer declared bankruptcy, apparently, the book suggests, to 
illegally evade creditors. 
</P>
<P>
A long battle ensued. But Weinberg concludes that "the relative painlessness 
with which Julius and Rose (Armand's mother) escaped from bankruptcy court, 
despite the untruthfulness of their testimony, almost surely impressed upon 
everybody that cover-ups and convenient memory lapses could be useful tactics." 
</P>
<P>
At age 10, Armand was sent by his parents to live with a socialist colleague of 
his father's in Connecticut and stayed there five years -- ". . . it seems not 
to have done any lasting harm to his psyche, unless a possible feeling of 
abandonment should be regarded as causing his lifelong quest for public 
adulation," Weinberg writes. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer took over as the head of his family at age 21, when his father was 
arrested and eventually convicted of first-degree manslaughter in connection 
with the death of a woman on whom he had performed an abortion. Many observers 
at the time contended that the 2 1/2 years Hammer's father spent in Sing Sing 
prison stemmed from his leftist beliefs more than any lapse in medical 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's fight to free his father became a personal crusade, and Weinberg 
traces a similar tenacity -- and what the author sees as a similar willingness 
to bend the rules -- through some of Hammer's many other quests, including his 
thus-far unsuccessful attempt to drill for oil in Pacific Palisades and his 
successful bid to receive a presidential pardon for making illegal campaign 
contributions to former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer first made his fortune selling medicine with a high dose of alcohol 
during Prohibition and quickly became, in Weinberg's words, "a deal junkie." On 
a trip to Moscow in 1921, Hammer met, and impressed, Soviet premier Vladimir 
Ilyich Lenin. Unexpectedly, he settled for nine years in the Soviet Union, 
where he operated an asbestos mine, established a pencil factory and began 
dealing in Czarist art, among other enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer and his third wife, Frances, didn't invest in Occidental Petroleum until 
1956, when it was a tiny company with $79,000 in assets. They thought several 
new wells Oxy planned to drill at the time would be losers and that those 
financial losses would make a nice tax shelter for their already substantial 
wealth, Weinberg writes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the drillers hit oil. 
</P>
<P>
Other successes followed, and, in 1957, Hammer, who had been briefly reluctant 
to get into the industry, became president of Occidental Petroleum, which then 
had a full-time staff of three. Quickly, Weinberg writes, Hammer began 
"reshaping Occidental's board of directors in his image." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has never been a majority shareholder in Occidental. Rather, Weinberg 
writes, he controlled the company then and now with "his forceful personality, 
keen mind, capacity for work and incessant salesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
And cunning. For example, Hammer demanded that many Oxy board members submit 
signed, undated letters of resignation, which kept the members effectively 
under his thumb, Weinberg writes. 
</P>
<P>
As the company grew and diversified, it ran into the sort of problems any 
multinational conglomerate might. Allegations of illegal payoffs to government 
officials have haunted Hammer for years, for instance. As has labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
One issue that receives Weinberg's attention is whether Hammer has, at times, 
put Occidental's bottom line ahead of the greater public good, as when 
Occidental inherited the toxic mess at Love Canal and, critics have said, 
dragged its corporate feet in settling claims. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Weinberg's book suggests that Hammer's oil dealings with Libya "set 
in train the oil price rises of the 1970s" and eventually "without question . . 
. changed the balance of power in the world." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the book also raises the issue of whether Hammer sometimes 
puts his own ego -- and, some say, capricious goals -- ahead of the interests 
of Occidental, as suggested by the class-action lawsuits that have been filed 
against him by shareholders over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg asserts that out of respect for the intelligence of readers, his book 
leaves such subjective issues open to debate. Besides, he's not sure of his own 
conclusions, he said. At no point in the writing or research did he ever have 
the sort of epiphany some biographers experience -- a moment when the sea of 
facts and anecdotes parts miraculously and the True Nature of the person under 
scrutiny reveals itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of respect for some of what he's done; a great deal of 
abhorrence for some of what he's done. He's very complex. Maybe that was my 
epiphany -- how complex he is. . . . Some think he walks on water. Some think 
he's the devil incarnate." 
</P>
<P>
In an essay on the art of biography he wrote for the Missouri Review, Weinberg 
quoted Thomas Carlyle: "A well-written life is almost as rare as a well-spent 
one." 
</P>
<P>
He rewrote this one six times, from beginning to end. But he remains 
unconvinced that anyone ever fully captures a person's life in print. "I'm very 
humble about the biographer's job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews of "The Untold Story," however, have been generally favorable. If 
anything, they accuse Weinberg of letting Hammer off easy. Fortune magazine 
reviewer Irwin Ross called it "a good book, iconoclastic by necessity but 
judicious in tone, skeptical rather than hostile." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said that "Mr. Weinberg, in spite of his careful detachment, 
appears to be rather too easily won over by Mr. Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
The only review that makes Weinberg bristle appeared in Business Week. In it, 
Stewart Toy wrote that "the most striking thing about this book is how little 
the facts vary from those in Hammer's 1987 autobiography." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg argues that while both books are basically accurate in the facts they 
present, his book is packed with new information. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, none of Hammer's four major run-ins with the U. S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission are mentioned in Hammer's 1987 autobiography. By filing 
Freedom of Information Act requests with the SEC, Weinberg turned up reams of 
previously unavailable information, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer continues to fight him in federal court on the release of documents 
detailing the last two SEC investigations of Occidental, contending those 
files, which pertain, in part, to Hammer's negotiations in Libya and Latin 
America, "involve supposed national security issues," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer and his lawyers went crazy to stop me. They spent a lot of time and I 
presume a lot of money to convince the SEC not to release the files," he said. 
For the book, Weinberg had to rely on now-available public records to discuss 
those later investigations. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to include the information that will come from further release 
of documents in subsequent editions. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if a Hammer lawsuit doesn't somehow push the book out of print. 
</P>
<P>
In his biography, Weinberg quotes Hammer attorney Louis Nizer as saying that 
Hammer is "unabashedly litigious. . . . When principle is involved, he rejects 
compromise. . . . It does not matter how great the gamble." 
</P>
<P>
So at first, Weinberg thought Hammer was simply trying to quash a book that 
contained more information than Hammer wanted the public to have. After all, he 
said, virtually everyone he talked to agrees that "The Doctor likes to control 
his own image and own fate." 
</P>
<P>
But lately Hammerologists have suggested to Weinberg that The Doctor may 
actually be cooking up the controversy as a convoluted way to feed his own 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough people who know Hammer have suggested that that I'm beginning to 
believe it -- especially considering that he hasn't pressed things," Weinberg 
said. "I'm more and more convinced that he's just wily enough to have done all 
this to boost sales of the book."

LOCAL NAACP HONORS 8 'GREAT BLACK DESIGNERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Kevan Hall's downtown Los Angeles loft, overshadowed by garments about to be 
shipped and fabric about to be cut, is a small sketch bearing the simple 
inscription: "Willi Smith 1948-1987." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know Willi very well," Hall said of the much-lauded black designer, 
who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. "But I admired him from the 
time I was in high school. I admired the fact that he was able to make 
great-looking, spirited clothes. I admired the fact that at a very early age he 
commanded the respect of the industry and belonged to the inner circle of 
designers." 
</P>
<P>
Only 31 himself, Hall was honored Sunday night by the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People as one of the "Great Black Designers" along with 
seven others, including Paris-based Patrick Kelly and Karl Logan of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea of showcasing black designers; there's not enough of that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Hall was already studying fashion design at Cass Technical High 
School in Detroit (alumni include Diana Ross and Lily Tomlin), preparing to be 
part of the inner circle. Now he is there. 
</P>
<P>
His Kevan Hall Couture label and the newer Kevan Hall Studio line are carried 
by I. Magnin-Bullocks Wilshire, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's and Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
He also commands lofty prices. Hall's couture collection runs from $600 for a 
short, silk-crepe dinner dress with a touch of lace or a bit of beading up to 
$2,000 for a lavishly beaded silk-charmeuse dress. The Studio pieces go from 
$400 for a cocktail dress or a dinner suit to $600 for one of the season's 
hottest numbers, Hall's off-the-shoulder, satin-trimmed pants suit. 
</P>
<P>
Roz Becker, co-owner of Roz &amp; Sherm in Birmingham, Mich., an affluent 
suburb of Detroit, hangs Hall's couture label with those of Oscar de La Renta, 
Byblos and Carolyne Roehm. 
</P>
<P>
Becker originally came across his cocktail dresses -- which she describes as 
beautiful -- and his evening gowns -- which she terms magnificent -- in New 
York, and bought them for her "very sophisticated, very social" customer 
without knowing Hall was a Detroit native. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has since made a number of personal appearances at Roz &amp; Sherm, with 
its trompe l'oeil marble and cloud scene on the ceiling. Hall calculates he 
draws a few hundred customers to the store who tend to buy "three, six, eight 
pieces each." 
</P>
<P>
The lean, bespectacled designer still has the garment that launched his career. 
It is an off-the-shoulder cocktail dress in "face-powder pink and taupe silk." 
It won him the Peacock Award from the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising in Los Angeles when he graduated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps that prize-winner, along with his favorite pieces from every 
collection, in a special closet at home. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm 70, someone may want to do a retrospective," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Before Hall became committed to his dressy suits and evening wear he took a 
little detour into high-fashion sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, after working for several designers, Hall and his wife, Debbie, who he 
met at the fashion institute, set up shop in their L. A. apartment. Although 
conditions were cramped, there were the characteristic Kevan Hall touches of 
class. His cutting table, for example, was marble. 
</P>
<P>
The fledging collection included skirts and jackets in loden-green wool 
combined with fuchsia silk charmeuse blouses. Despite substantial prices -- 
$400 for a jacket, $200 for a skirt -- Hall says the collection sold 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, there is the influence of a fashionable Detroit household. His 
father, who owned a landscaping firm, wore custom-made suits. His mother 
dressed "in Chanel copies." For Sunday school, the three Hall children were 
"always impeccably dressed." His sister wore hats and gloves. He and his 
brother (Broadway actor-singer-dancer Vondie Curtis Hall) wore "little suits 
and cashmere coats." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's plans for the future include opening his own retail stores, starting in 
Los Angeles, then in key cities in this country and in England and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
There might even be "couture baby clothes," now that Hall is about to become a 
first-time father. 
</P>
<P>
His NAACP award, a sculpture by Los Angeles artist Greg Abbott, is already over 
his fireplace at home. But Hall rates the charities that benefited that night 
the most significant aspect of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 800 people, at $100 a ticket, attended the event sponsored by the 
Beverly Hills/Hollywood chapter of the NAACP to help Minority AIDS Project, 
American Philanthropy Assn. shelters for the homeless and Cal-Pac South 
scholarships. There were celebrities in the audience and celebrity entertainers 
in the show, but chapter president Willis Edwards said the biggest names of the 
night "are the designers." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Kelly and Logan, other honorees were Keith Holman-Harper, who 
creates unusual suede, leather and beaded tuxedos; Raymond Price, who 
specializes in one-of-a-kind furs made in Finland; singer-costume designer 
Linda Stokes; Perry White who creates sexy, colorful clothes for Non-Stop 
Design; and Ahneva Ahneva, who introduced her ethnic-inspired garments with 
African music. 
</P>
<P>
In was an evening with a number of glitches, including an overactive smoke 
machine, an hour-late start for the fashion show and a disappointing finale, 
featuring New York super-model Beverly Johnson in an all-white wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
The gown, by Linda Stokes, had an ordinary train, not the one that was promised 
-- which was to have been made from fabric swatches supplied by all the 
designers. The plan had been to remove the train after the show and send it to 
Washington to be sewn into the AIDS quilt. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what happened, Debbie Hall shrugged, saying: "It was never made. I 
still have a huge bag of scraps that no one ever came to pick up." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everything that went wrong was set right by the humor of host Sinbad, 
who plays Walter Oakes on NBC's "A Different World." The fashion show, he 
explained, "is one hour late. It will be two hours late next year." 
</P>
<P>
And everyone went home hoping there would be a show next year. Maybe one that 
wouldn't be two hours late, with a train that gets to Washington.

GIFTS FROM THE HEART ARE GOOD IDEAS FOR HOLIDAY HOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JAPENGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some guests may tremble at the prospect of picking just the right holiday 
offering for that sophisticated host. But one recent visitor to the home of 
Colin Cowie, a Westside party designer and caterer extraordinaire, was not 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you told me that you love the apple tart from Michel Richard," the 
guest told Cowie, proffering the treat at his host's front door, "but I must 
apologize -- the maid took a big bite out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie, who was charmed by the flawed tart, tells the story to emphasize that at 
holiday parties, it's your presence, not your gift, that counts. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to get together, not to wait in anticipation to see what 
people are going to bring you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that assurance -- and the equally comforting advice from prime 
party-goers and etiquette sages that, in most cases, it's fine to show up 
empty-handed -- it still holds that an invitation to dinner during the holidays 
will leave most people groping at the last minute for the proper token to tote. 
</P>
<P>
The age-old instinct -- to bring wine or flowers -- has come under scrutiny in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Ford, author of an etiquette book and a manners column for McCall's 
Magazine, said guests should never bring flowers to a dinner party, although it 
is acceptable to send them later. Why? Because if presented with such a gift, 
"the hostess has to leave her guests and run and find a vase." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's is not the final word on this issue, as some other knowledgeable folk 
still prefer flowers to other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Scheips, whose holiday schedule sends him scrambling for a gift as many 
as five nights a week, says flowers make an evening of food and conversation 
less ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, you're gone but the flowers still are there," said Scheips, 
organizer of Art L. A. '89, an international art fair at the Convention Center 
Dec. 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
As for wine, still one of the most popular dinner gifts, many in the know now 
urge against this offering because it may undercut or befuddle the host who 
already has the beverage selected for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, the naysayers are not going unchallenged. Ford, for instance, says 
it's fine to take wine, just don't expect the host to uncork it that evening. 
That way no one has to worry about the selection clashing with the meal. 
</P>
<P>
If the function is formal, it's better not to take a gift at all but to send 
something before or after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie's favorite pre-party gift is a box of Teuscher Champagne truffles flown 
in from Europe once a week and available for $18-$72 at the Teuscher store in 
Beverly Hills. He calls the chocolates the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have the time to do it, I make a basket and put in Christmas mince pies 
and almonds," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
But if he's rushed, Cowie might go with a tin of Williams-Sonoma Scottish 
shortbread (about $10), tied with a red or green ribbon. Party-goers en route 
to dinner engagements also breeze by the Williams-Sonoma stores around town for 
mustards, olive oils and Fini vinegar ($9 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
Another Cowie suggestion is the popular champagne and caviar gift baskets from 
Wally's Liquor Store in West Los Angeles. They run anywhere from $50 to more 
than $500. 
</P>
<P>
But what is most endearing to hosts these days is not the guest who drops $500 
on caviar but one who bakes a bundt cake, glazes walnuts, or hand paints an 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, time is of the essence and what really is very special is if someone 
has taken time on a gift," Cowie said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Ausman, chief of protocol for Los Angeles County, agreed, adding that 
the most cherished party offering these days is anything homemade. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of do-it-yourself ideas is Martha Stewart's new Christmas 
cookbook, she said. An item from Stewart's book Ausman recommends is the 
pomander, a scented orange made to be hung in closets or hallways during the 
holidays. You take an orange, stud it with cloves (adding the cloves is hard on 
the thumbs, Ausman said) then hang it up to dry and later roll it in cinnamon 
and other spices. 
</P>
<P>
Another inexpensive gift from Stewart's book is potpourri. Ausman said she 
saved all the flower petals from her daughter's wedding this year and now has 
lots of dried petals to stuff in potpourri pouches along with spices and 
scents. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Weiss, who attends many social functions in her dual roles as director of 
special events at the Music Center and president of the board of directors of 
the Downtown Women's Center, said a sure-fire gift is wrapping paper designed 
by artists. Some recipients find the paper so beautiful that they can't bear to 
use it as wrapping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman and others also mentioned the Los Angeles County Museum store as a good 
source for this and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss cautioned that because of the tradition of giving to the host, anyone who 
entertains often during the holidays "can really end up with a bunch of weird 
things." Because of that, she noted that it has become more popular for guests 
to send a donation to a charity with a note to the host saying the offering has 
been made in honor of a particular holiday get-together. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are changing their feelings about conspicuous consumption," she 
said, adding that means a donation might be the best visitor's gift of all this 
year.

GOING FOR GOLD AS AN INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell is a syndicated columnist and former Times staff 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In 1982, I bought gold South African Krugerrands for $444 each. In 
1988 I started selling them, piece by piece, and received $397 to $415 each, 
even though the gold Maple Leaf and other gold coins were going for more than 
$470. I was told by Deak International that the low price of the Krugerrands 
was because of our boycott against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Since gold is gold, regardless of what country the gold comes from, please tell 
me if I'm getting ripped off. -- M.D. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Gold is gold, sure enough, but price is still the measure of the 
equation between demand and supply. And the demand for Krugerrands "has just 
not been there for several years," according to Karen Jennings, manager here 
for Deak International Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Despite constant arguments that gold is "just another metal," the metal has had 
a hypnotic appeal since the Egyptians discovered it about 4000 BC, and for 
centuries it was the world's "ultimate store of value" and was the backing for 
almost all currencies. Even now, gold is generally regarded as one of the more 
reliable hedges against inflation -- which is why the price of the metal soars 
during periods of high inflation and drops precipitously during periods of 
stable prices. 
</P>
<P>
But holding gold, either as an investment or as an inflation hedge, has always 
presented problems. To hold it in "raw" form, as ingots or dust, is unwieldy 
because it has to be assayed every time you try to sell it. A much better 
solution: Hold it in the form of established coinage, where the gold content is 
clearly a matter of record. 
</P>
<P>
For years, then, investors (as distinguished from numismatists, who collect 
coins for their historic value and their visual condition) concentrated 
principally on two widely circulated international coins -- the Mexican 50 Peso 
Centenario and the Austrian 100 Corona. A third coin, the Hungarian 100 Korona, 
had a limited circulation for reasons that are comparable to the Krugerrand's 
woes -- investors disliked benefiting Hungary's Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
All three coins, though, had one cumbersome feature -- the offbeat weight of 
the coins, which made it difficult to determine their current market value. 
Both the Corona and the Korona are .98 Troy ounce and the Centenario is 1.2 
Troy ounces. 
</P>
<P>
When South Africa, which sits on most of the world's known supply of unmined 
gold, decided in the 1960s to create the Krugerrand, leave it undenominated, 
but peg it at exactly 1.00 Troy ounce, it was an instant hit because of its 
convenience. If you had 100 Krugerrands you had exactly 100 ounces of gold, and 
all you had to do was look up the "spot" price of gold on any given day and 
you'd know exactly what your holdings were worth. 
</P>
<P>
"But, because of their convenience," Jennings adds, "coins traditionally sell 
at a slight premium." 
</P>
<P>
On the day we discussed this, the "spot" price for gold was $367 an ounce and 
Deak was buying the Canadian Maple Leaf (also 1.00 Troy ounce) for $372 -- a 
$5-an-ounce premium -- but was buying the Krugerrand for $357, a $10-an-ounce 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
"But the 'spot' price," she says, "isn't actually the price of an ounce of gold 
that's been melted down, as you might think, but is simply the market 
determination of gold's value on that day." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Krugerrand's additional convenience of being exactly 1.00 Troy 
ounce, "it was tremendously popular for several years." 
</P>
<P>
But then apartheid and its ugliness flared up, the violence accelerated, and 
the world's growing disillusionment with South Africa's unyielding position on 
racial relations began sharply eroding the Krugerrand's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Canadians came out with the gold Maple Leaf in the mid, or late, 
'70s," Jennings adds, "it was beautiful timing. Investors really wanted a 
one-ounce gold coin, and for several years Canada practically had a corner on 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
Then Uncle Sam took the hint and came out with the one-ounce Eagle in 1986. "A 
lot of the bigger dealers today," she says, "and we're one of them, won't even 
sell the Krugerrand, and we buy them back only because so many of our customers 
originally bought them from us. We feel obligated."

JAZZNOST HITS A HIGH NOTE WITH SOVIET AND U.S. MUSICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Richie Cole was playing "Meadowlands" and "Bublitchki Bop" for his fans 
in Tallinn, Estonia, on Tuesday night, Igor Bril and his All-Star Soviet Jazz 
Quartet were showing off their repertoire, from "Body and Soul" to blues by 
Bird, at Bon Appetit in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fair exchange, part of the two-way proliferation that has seen 
avant-garde and Dixieland groups from Moscow and Leningrad on American turf 
while touring U.S. jazz men in growing numbers discover with amazement the 
extent of their fame in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling with the Bril quartet, which played three Bay Area dates over the 
weekend, is Alexei Batashev, the Soviet Union's foremost spokesman for jazz, 
who was on the scene when Benny Goodman, breaking a longstanding sound barrier, 
brought an all-star orchestra to the Soviet Union in 1962 (the premier 
performance was attended by then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev). Batashev 
wrote the first Soviet history book on the subject, emcees concerts, travels 
around the world festival scene, and has his own TV show (something no American 
jazz expert can claim). 
</P>
<P>
"The changes are fantastic," Batashev said. "Moscow, where for years we had 
only one jazz club, now has half a dozen, all with different programs daily. 
</P>
<P>
"There are now 10 annual jazz festivals in the Soviet Union, and almost all of 
them are international. Recently we had one in Tblisi featuring Freddie Hubbard 
-- he has a terrific following in Russia -- as well as Art Blakey, Eddie Harris 
and Jimmy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Last month, Gene Harris' all-star big band stopped in Moscow during its world 
tour and played to two sold-out houses. A great orchestra, with world-class 
names like Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, Harry (Sweets) Edison. I introduced them, and 
they got a tremendous reception." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how seriously the once-banned art of jazz is now taken in his country, 
Batashev said: "It is greatly respected. Of course, many musicians still are 
inspired by listening to Americans, first on record and now more frequently in 
person. But today, jazz is officially taught in many Soviet colleges and 
conservatories." 
</P>
<P>
Bril has been a part of the Soviet jazz scene for more than 20 years, having 
made his debut as a so-called "lyrical romantic" at the Moscow "Jazz '65" 
Festival. He wrote the first Soviet textbook of its kind, "The Basics of Jazz 
Improvisation." 
</P>
<P>
Now on his second visit to these shores but his first to California, pianist 
and composer Bril is represented by a recent CD, "Live At the Village Gate" 
(Mobile Fidelity MFCD 861). With him on the harrowing two-day journey (Moscow 
to Shannon to Havana, then three stops in Mexico and finally San Francisco) 
were Alexander Oseichuk, a prominent Soviet saxophonist; Victor Dvoskin, a 
bassist who has topped the Soviet Jazz Critics' Poll for the last 10 years, and 
Eugene Ryabol, 35, who in Moscow circles is considered the best drummer of his 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
Oseichuk is regarded as his country's most versatile saxophonist. "He started 
out, of course, as a Charlie Parker fan," said Batashev, "but now he's an 
admirer of Phil Woods. He is au courant with all the latest jazz trends, but he 
is also a gifted classical musician." 
</P>
<P>
The Bril quartet's predominantly mainstream repertoire mixes original works by 
the leader with some of the orthodox jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
Where once the tours were all arranged by government officials in both 
countries, today many musicians visit the Soviet Union independently. "We had a 
big band from Oregon, a fine American college ensemble," Batashev said. "It is 
no longer a problem getting to hear American jazz live." 
</P>
<P>
The rosy picture presented by Batashev left one lingering doubt: Can the Soviet 
scene have changed so drastically that there are now no difficulties at all? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure," Batashev said, "we have problems -- with instruments, with 
equipment, and with the economic realities the audiences have to face. It's no 
big fun going to a concert when you may miss an opportunity to stand in line 
for milk."

JAZZ NOTES: BRIL IN TOWN, RICHIE COLE TOURING RUSSIA; WOO ELECTED TO BOARD OF 
PACIFIC PUBLIC RADIO

Glasnost is in the air this Thanksgiving. Soviet pianist Igor Bril appeared 
Tuesday at Bon Appetit in Westwood and Northern California-based saxophonist 
Richie Cole is currently in the midst of a tour of the Soviet Union. According 
to a press release, Cole -- whose latest Milestone LP is "Pop Bop" and who 
coincidentally lives in the Russian River town of Duncan Hills, Calif. -- 
played Moscow on Friday, Leningrad on Saturday and Sunday and will play 
Petrozavodsk, Thursday, before wrapping up his engagements in Kazanj, Sunday 
and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cole's repertoire -- built mostly around classic Russian tunes outfitted with 
new harmonies and modern jazz rhythms -- includes "The Internationale" (the 
communist anthem), "Let There Always Be Sunshine," which was a big hit in the 
Soviet Union in the '70s and the old favorite, "Midnight in Moscow." Cole has 
also written some originals for the occasion, "Glasnost Toast &amp; Jam," among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist, who many know from his work with the Manhattan Transfer and 
with the late singer Eddie Jefferson, is playing with Soviet musicians 
throughout his tour. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo has been elected to the board of 
Pacific Public Radio (PPR), the parent nonprofit corporation with operates 
KLON-FM (88.1), now the Los Angeles basin's only 24-hour jazz outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's long been an advocate of jazz, he's been out there and listening and we 
hoped he might take a more active role as a member of the board," said Rick 
Lewis, president of PPR and general manager of KLON. "So we asked him to join 
us and he gave an immediate 'yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who said that KLON's long-awaited power increase from 1,200 to 30,000 
watts may receive action from the Federal Communications Commission in the next 
30 days, said that Woo's presence on the PPR board will give the corporation 
and KLON at least one board member who is not from the Long Beach area, where 
KLON operates. "We want to make sure our expanded audience area is presented, 
and Michael Woo ensures that happening," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to better understand the role of the drum set in jazz will be just one 
of the highlights of "Max Roach: A Life in Sound," which airs at 4:30 a.m. 
Saturday on KPCC-FM (89.3). Roach, who rose to the top of the modern jazz 
spectrum playing with Charlie Parker in the mid-'40s and who recently appeared 
with his Double Quartet at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood, talks about 
everything from his solo drum performances to his compositions for various 
stage productions in this half-hour program produced by Benjamin Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 "Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown" (Various Artists, GRP Records). 
Released to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Charles Schulz' beloved 
"Peanuts" comic strip, this amalgamation of jazz and jazz/pop artists is 
particularly welcome for its appeal to children, an aspect most jazz recordings 
lack. Many of these now-familiar themes were written by the late pianist Vince 
Guaraldi for various "Charlie Brown" TV specials, and they have a buoyant, 
smiling feel. David Benoit captures the Guaraldi sound to a tee on "Linus and 
Lucy," Joe Williams lends a bluesy air to "Little Birdie" and Chick Corea's 
trio prances through "The Great Pumpkin Waltz." Others on hand: Dave Brubeck, 
Kenny G, Lee Ritenour and B.B. King. 
</P>
<P>
Records are rated from one to five stars. ***** means a swinging must-have for 
the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.

SOLUTION REACHED IN NUREYEV OPERA DISPUTE

<P>
After months of rumor and speculation, l'affaire Nureyev has come to a 
resolution -- at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting Tuesday afternoon, Rudolf Nureyev and Pierre Berge, president 
of the Paris Opera, announced jointly that the ballet superstar would step down 
as director of dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. Nureyev will assume the post 
of first choreographer, which has been created especially for him. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jean-Albert Cartier, general administrator of the Paris 
Opera-Garnier, a replacement for Nureyev has yet to be chosen. In the meantime, 
his functions will continue to be carried out by ballet masters Patrice Bart 
and Eugene Polyakov, whom Berge had appointed interim dance directors last 
month, citing the "worrisome situation" caused by Nureyev's frequent absences 
from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The decision represents a graceful solution to an increasingly public dispute 
between Nureyev and Berge, which revolved around issues of artistic control as 
well as Nureyev's heavy travel schedule. It also puts a dignified end to 
Nureyev's sometimes brilliant and often troubled tenure at the ballet, while 
apparently insuring that his productions will continue to be seen at the Paris 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the announcement was not without its ironies. It was while in 
France in 1961, touring with the Kirov Ballet, that Nureyev defected to the 
West -- the same year that the Berlin Wall was built. Yet the meeting with 
Berge took place just after Nureyev's return from Leningrad where -- within 
days of the Wall being opened -- he had danced with the Kirov for the first 
time since he left the Soviet Union.

GUAVA TREE MAKES PEST OF ITSELF IN BREA;

INFESTATION: THE TREE IN WHICH A PREGNANT MEDFLY WAS FOUND HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT

If Grace Morton had her way, the guava tree in the front yard of her house 
would have been gone a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
She did not like the 12-foot-tall tree before last summer, when county 
officials stuck a small trap among its branches. And she has disliked it even 
more since Friday, when those same officials found a pregnant Mediterranean 
fruit fly residing in the basket-like device. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known they were going to find it in my tree . . . I would have 
knocked the hell out" of the guava tree, she said Tuesday. "It stands out like 
a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the fruit fly has prompted county agricultural officials to 
decide to spray a three-city area next week with malathion -- the first such 
sprayings ever in Orange County. The pesticide will rain down on a 
10-square-mile area, with the Mortons' guava tree, located near the 
intersection of Puente Street and West Walling Avenue, smack in the center. 
</P>
<P>
Morton said the tree, which was planted by a previous owner perhaps 15 years 
ago, has caused a lot of trouble. Most annoying is when the green-skinned fruit 
drops to the ground, she said. She once paid a few neighbor kids 15 cents 
apiece to pick up the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the tree also has wrapped itself around the eaves of the roof and 
has started to tower over the home's shake shingles. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly found in Florida and tropical America, guavas grow on shrubs and 
trees, which bear fruit after two or three years. The forest-green fruit on the 
Mortons' tree is egg-size, with grainy flesh underneath the inedible skin. 
</P>
<P>
The guava tree was not the only overgrown variety of vegetation that Morton, 
63, and her husband, Zeke, 69, found in 1984 when they moved into their home. 
She said she had to clean up a mess of shrubs, weeds and towering trees left by 
the previous owners. 
</P>
<P>
The Mortons' cleanup effort -- which meant planting new flower bushes and ferns 
-- also included removing a mountain pine from a slope in their back yard, at a 
cost of about $125. Although it provided the Mortons with more than enough 
firewood, the price made her think twice about getting rid of the guava. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known the problems these would cause, I would have knocked (the 
guava) down first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said she had no idea how the trouble-causing fruit fly found its way to 
her tree. 
</P>
<P>
She did not give the trap any further thought when agricultural officials set 
it there last summer. She does not know how her tree was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came by and they set the traps and they didn't tell us anything about 
it," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
When the pregnant fly was found, county officials sprayed the tree and a few 
berry bushes in the front yard. But Morton said she has heard nothing from them 
since. 
</P>
<P>
The aerial pesticide spraying upsets Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible nuisance," she said. "You don't know what kind of chemicals 
they're using. I'm not really for it." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she was uncertain what would be done with the tree, but she would 
like to see it gone by next year. She wants to plant a row of ferns in its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"They can take it and put it in a museum, I don't care," she said.

EAST ORANGE PROJECT TO JAM TRAFFIC, FOES FEAR; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OPPONENTS URGE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO INSIST THAT ROADS BE 
IMPROVED BEFORE THE IRVINE CO. IS ALLOWED TO START WORK ON MASSIVE PLAN.

About 100 people turned out for a City Council hearing Tuesday night, 
expressing fears that the Irvine Co.'s plan for a massive housing development 
on the eastern fringe of the city would worsen traffic in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like this plan," said Bob Bennyhoff, a slow-growth proponent. "It 
could mean a half-million more cars a day to our transportation problems in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Bennyhoff and others wanted assurances that city officials will demand that 
highway improvement projects, including the widening of Santiago Canyon Road 
and the extension of Jamboree Road, will be completed before any construction 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
"You should not allow any dirt to be moved until all those roads, as stated in 
the plan, are built," urged Mary Beth Lynch, an Orange resident. "You should 
act now rather than in hindsight. That's all we have in Southern California is 
people acting in hindsight. Orange County deserves better." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials gave a 25-minute slide presentation about the East Orange 
project to the City Council. This was followed by testimony from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange county environmental officials also raised concerns about 
transportation. By way of a letter to city officials, county Environmental 
Management Agency Director Ernie Schneider said that in addition to widening 
Santiago Canyon Road, the Irvine Co. should improve arterial streets, such as 
Newport Boulevard. Schneider also questioned the Irvine Co.'s plans to place 
two residential areas near the proposed Limestone Canyon Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano Irrigation District spokesman Joel D. Kuperberg told the council that 
the East Orange project, which includes the Santiago Reservoir, could threaten 
the reservoir, which serves 10,000 Villa Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We vigorously oppose the approval of the plan because of our concern about 
water quality and our fear that the water will be poisoned by future 
construction," Kuperberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Brad Olson, president of the Foothill Community Builders, a 
division of the Irvine Co., said the developers are interested in discussing 
the concerns of the water district. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no attempt to hide anything, but this is the first time that the water 
district has brought this up," Olson told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of affordable housing within the project was raised by Robert Jensen, 
chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College District. The district's 
Orange campus is in the development area. Jensen said the development should 
provide housing for residents of all income levels. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my concerns is turnover in our district because of Orange County's high 
housing costs and beginning salaries for teachers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission approved the project last month, and the City Council 
is to vote on the development Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The development will require an amendment to Orange's General Plan, the city's 
blueprint for residential and commercial construction. The amendment calls for 
development over the next 15 to 20 years of 7,110 acres of Irvine Co. property. 
The proposed community would add 34,000 people to the city's population, 
roughly equivalent to the present population of Brea or San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
More than 12,300 housing units would be built, along with a recreation center, 
golf course and civic center. Two major commercial centers are expected to 
create 27,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current population is about 106,400. Mayor Don E. Smith said that as 
a result of this proposal and other growth, he expects the city's population to 
grow by nearly 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on this plan for more than three years," Smith said before 
the hearing. "There'll be months more to go of the approval process, if this 
General Plan gets approved." 
</P>
<P>
The 11-square-mile area, running along each side of Rancho Santiago Boulevard 
and including Irvine Lake, would include four activity centers, containing 
businesses and community services surrounded by residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the largest single planned community ever attempted by the 
Irvine Co., which owns about one-sixth of the land in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for four or five development phases, with areas being annexed as 
they are built. Construction could begin in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that we have been planning this by working hand in hand 
with the city," said Dawn McCormick, an Irvine Co. spokeswoman. "What we had in 
mind was creating a balance of housing and jobs and that there be adequate 
roadways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As to early complaints by residents who preferred less density, McCormick said 
the company "had to strike a balance with new jobs, and enough people to 
support the proposed shopping centers." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to this proposal comes on the heels of a massive protest against 
another Irvine Co. development, Laguna Laurel in pristine Laguna Canyon. On 
Nov. 11, more than 7,000 people marched in protest, staging an eleventh-hour 
attempt to block the project and to preserve the wild area as a huge 
"greenbelt," or open-space area. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, environmentalists have already signed an agreement with the Irvine 
Co. supporting the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bloom, a Sea and Sage Audubon Society official, has testified before the 
Planning Commission in support of the project. Bloom told the commission the 
society made its decision to support the amendment after being included in the 
planning process by the Irvine Co. Also, Bloom said the company agreed to 
relocate two housing tracts away from the southeast corner of the development 
and preserve 200 acres of wild oak groves near the proposed Limestone Canyon 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted 4 to 0 to recommend that the City Council approve 
the East Orange General Plan on Oct. 31. Commissioner Randy Bosch abstained. 
</P>
<P>
However, before approving the project, the commission recommended several 
stipulations: 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing the minimum lot size to 6,000 square feet, and the minimum 
driveway length to 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Setting a timetable for expanding Jamboree Road, one of the area's main 
thoroughfares, to four lanes as far as the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
* Providing a certain amount of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Once a General Plan amendment is approved, Mayor Smith said, the Irvine Co. 
intends to submit a specific plan proposal that would separate the East Orange 
project into four distinct developments. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be holding many more hearings on these plans, and those who oppose it 
will have their chance to be heard," Smith said.

AIRPORT STAFF GEARS FOR YEAR'S BUSIEST DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just under 20,000 travelers are expected to jam John Wayne Airport today, 
prompting officials to beef up security, add extra parking lot shuttles and 
urge people to arrive early -- or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
An extra 6,000 passengers are anticipated, adding to the more than 12,000 who 
pass through the crowded terminal on an average day. This year's holiday 
throngs also face detours and unfamiliar surroundings resulting from 
construction involving the airport's $310-million expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes a new, $50-million terminal scheduled to open April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The day before Thanksgiving usually is the airport's busiest, airport officials 
said, although last year passenger volume was heaviest on the Monday and 
Tuesday following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is expected to be on a big scale, ranging from traffic and security 
police to food and drink at the airport restaurant, which has been stocked to 
accommodate the big crowds expected today and on into next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hell . . . from 10 a.m. on," said Bill Pemberton, assistant 
chief of airport operations. "Our main concern is to reduce the congestion as 
much as possible at the terminal." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year veteran of directing Thanksgiving Day traffic at the airport, 
Pemberton said that holiday traffic is "going to be particularly bad this year" 
because the construction is at its "height" and many roadways have been 
narrowed to single lanes in some places. 
</P>
<P>
Pemberton suggested that people park in the remote parking lots -- where 
additional free shuttles are scheduled to run to and from the terminal area 
every 10 to 15 minutes -- and avoid the terminal-loading area or the metered 
lot nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Parking Structure, one-tenth of a mile from the terminal, or the 
lot on Main Street between MacArthur Boulevard and Red Hill Avenue are best 
bets, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
Airport-bound traffic from the Newport Beach area, traveling north on Campus 
Drive, will be unable to turn left into the airport due to construction there, 
officials said, so drivers are encouraged to use Birch Street and then 
MacArthur Boulevard, Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
All other traffic is expected to use the MacArthur Boulevard entrance south of 
the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager George Rebella advised travelers to arrive at the airport at 
least two hours before flights are scheduled to depart. He also suggested that 
those coming to the airport to pick up arrivals wait about 15 to 25 minutes 
after the scheduled arrival time to meet passengers. "By that time, they'll 
have their luggage and be ready to hop right in the car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff Department's two-man staff has been increased by one 
to help direct traffic and provide security today and also on Sunday and 
Monday, when traffic will swell again, Pemberton said. 
</P>
<P>
And 17 skycaps are scheduled to work both the morning and evening shifts today, 
up four from the usual 13, to help passengers with luggage and keep the traffic 
in front of the terminal moving, skycap supervisor Eric Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the terminal, Anita Lewis, manager of Delaney's restaurant and coffee 
shop, said she is ready for the rush and expects heavy use of the cocktail 
lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to put more people on (work shifts). We've had to order quite a bit 
extra," said Lewis, who expects a 30% increase in business. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, officials said, the airport handles 12,500 or so passengers. 
Today, they expect between 18,000 and 20,000 people, compared to nearly 17,000 
on the day before Thanksgiving last year. Crowds are expected to thin somewhat 
on Friday but increase again Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had little advice for those travelers seeking the best time during 
peak periods to head for the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday, Sunday and Monday are just terrible," Pemberton said. "I don't 
think there is a good time."

because of fog at Boise. Airport traffic, right, was already becoming a bit 
heavy at Tuesday noon. ; Map, TIPS ON USING THE AIRPORT, Los Angeles Times

VICTIM IDENTIFIED IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Tuesday identified a man Tuesday who staggered several blocks before 
dropping dead of a bullet wound Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Robert Joseph Herrera, 23, of Placentia was found by officers in 
the 200 block of North Clementine Street. Witnesses told police that they heard 
gunshots but did not see the attack about 8 p.m. Monday in the 300 block of 
West Chartres Street. There was no motive or description of the shooter, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second fatal shooting in the area recently. On Nov. 7, the body of a 
35-year-old man was found with a gunshot wound to the head in a car on the 
north side of Pearson Park, at Sycamore Street and Harbor Boulevard, Anaheim 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Since no weapon was found nearby, the latest case was being handled as a 
homicide. But police said they had no suspects or motives for the shooting.

ROAD-WIDENING FOES TO SEEK INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council rejected a request from a residents' group Tuesday to let 
voters decide whether Bastanchury Road should be widened. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group, Save Our Bastanchury, said they now will propose an 
initiative election on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Adding two lanes along a one-mile stretch of Bastanchury will detract from the 
area's rural atmosphere, said John Bastian, a spokesman for the group, which 
has about 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
To place the issue on the ballot, members of Save Our Bastanchury must collect 
signatures from 15% of Fullerton's registered voters, about 8,700 people. 
</P>
<P>
A special election would cost the city about $58,000, City Clerk Anne M. York 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved widening Bastanchury between Harbor Boulevard and Euclid 
Street in 1985 and renewed its decision in July, despite the group's protest. 
The widening project is scheduled to begin in the summer of 1991 and is 
intended to help ease rush-hour congestion in the north end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bastian said his group already has hired attorneys to seek legal solutions and 
write a ballot initiative, which they plan to submit to the city next week. TOM

<P>
Wearing his best suit and a construction worker's hard hat, Principal Gene 
Bedley waited for the next water balloon to smash into him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the moment he had asked for -- even created and titled. Bedley had 
promised that the "Blast Mr. Bedley With a Water Balloon" award would be 
bestowed on each class at El Camino Real Elementary School that raised $700 or 
more in a recent jog-a-thon for new school equipment. He even promised to wear 
his best suit. 
</P>
<P>
After more than $16,000 was raised, Bedley's best attire on Monday became a wet 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I even wore light-colored pants so the water would show better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the staff of El Camino Real again presented Bedley with balloons, 
this time filled with helium, as part of a Mr. Bedley Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second honor in two weeks. Last Thursday, Bedley received the George 
Washington Honor Medal for distinguished service at the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station. During an Appreciation Day breakfast, Bedley noted that "kids are 
our greatest teachers," and he dedicated his George Washington medal to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene sets the tone for the entire school with his positive approach to 
education," said second-grade teacher Jenni Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-grade teacher Sherri Ernst, inspired by Bedley to become a teacher, said 
she "would not work for anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a warm, loving, caring person," she said. "He's my hero." 
</P>
<P>
Bedley said he follows a simple philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect kids," he said, "and they will respect you." STEVE BILLITER

CHIEF PIER DESIGNER WILL STAY ON THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending some confusion and controversy surrounding the architect hired to design 
its new municipal pier, City Council members agreed Monday to retain Ron Yeo as 
chief pier designer. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona del Mar-based designer, whom the city originally hired in February, 
will complete his work on the $10.5-million pier-rebuilding project and 
proposed adjoining pier gateway plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The council also decided that Yeo will preside over a January planning session 
for the proposed plaza, which would cost an additional $6 million and include 
shops and restaurants at the foot of the pier. Wes Bannister was the only 
council member Monday who opposed the idea of Yeo overseeing the planning 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Yeo had been notified Sept. 19 in a letter from City Engineer Les Evans that he 
was being removed from the project, but officials said Monday that he will be 
retained with more clearly defined responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Peter M. Green, a member of the pier design committee, said Yeo was 
never fired. 
</P>
<P>
"He fulfilled his obligation to the contract to design our new pier," he said. 
"And I thought he did a tremendous job." 
</P>
<P>
Yeo was hired for about $84,000 to design the lifeguard tower, bait shop, snack 
bars, cafe and other buildings on the pier, as well as the pier itself. 
Additionally, he began some preliminary designs on the pier plaza, which some 
officials charged he carried out before receiving city approval. As a result, 
Councilman John Erskine, who raised the issue about Yeo at Monday's meeting, 
included in the motion to retain Yeo a stipulation that city officials clearly 
define the project's scope. 
</P>
<P>
The pier project, which Green said is proceeding on schedule, is planned to be 
completed by Labor Day of 1991. If a pier plaza is added, it almost certainly 
would not be completed until long after the new pier's opening, Green said.

CONFERENCE FOCUSES ON AREA SOCIAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, top decision-makers from several public and private human 
service organizations in South Orange County met to share information Tuesday 
on the rapidly developing social needs there. 
</P>
<P>
The first Human Service Conference, held at the Dana Point Resort hotel, gave 
such public officials as Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez a 
chance to meet representatives of more than 140 social service groups, in 
workshops dealing with issues from drug abuse to mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"All these groups speak as individual voices," said Judy Curreri, Dana Point 
city councilwoman. "We had to speak as a unified voice. This conference is a 
start." 
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the South Orange County Community Services Council, 
a coalition of social service groups. 
</P>
<P>
"By bringing together people who are the real decision makers in the community, 
we can make a real dent" in the social problems facing South County, said Lee 
Steelman, council president. 
</P>
<P>
Although a dozen seminars on different issues were offered, a common complaint 
was that help for people in crisis is frequently scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Gipson, a county social worker who deals with child abuse, said: "There 
are more and more people looking for help. And there is a real lack of services 
available in South Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Steelman recalled one man who called a Community Services information line and 
threatened to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
She took the man's number and promised to find help. Several phone calls later, 
she was still looking. "One mental health unit actually told me that if I gave 
them his name, they'd have to call the police," she said. Steelman finally 
found a private psychiatrist willing to see the distraught man. 
</P>
<P>
The well-known affluence of South County, "casts a false shadow on the needs of 
people here," Steelman said. "That false impression has a harmful effect on 
people who don't have money." 
</P>
<P>
The council president said that many service organizations also have financial 
trouble. Charitable contributions from Orange County residents lag far behind 
donations raised by other California communities, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Keynote speaker Narda Zacchino, editor of the Orange County Edition of The 
Times, said: "There is a callous indifference for the less fortunate among us. 
There is a coldness among public officials that hasn't gotten better. It has 
gotten much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Another keynote speaker, Mark Baldassare, a demographer who teaches at UC 
Irvine, said that although a recent poll showed 53% of South County residents 
make more than $50,000 annually, many people still must rent their homes. 
</P>
<P>
With over one third paying rent, "The image of the expensive house (in South 
County), with a pool, isn't true," he said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

PETITION DRIVE OPENS ON ELECTION CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Tustin residents has kicked off a referendum effort to reverse the 
City Council's decision to move local elections from November to April. 
</P>
<P>
The change was approved unanimously by the council Monday night with members 
Earl J. Prescott and John Kelly absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council majority says that April elections cost less for 
candidates and allow greater focus on local issues, residents Berklee Maughan, 
Carole Bryant, Nova Pack and Mark Bachan disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by Prescott and Kelly, they say that November elections cost the city 
less and attract more voters to the polls. And changing now will allow 
challengers only four months to organize their campaigns, putting them at a 
disadvantage, Maughan said. 
</P>
<P>
The group has until Dec. 20 to gather 2,056 signatures from registered Tustin 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to collect signatures (now)," Maughan said, in a planned 
door-to-door campaign to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic. We've had a good response," he added. 
</P>
<P>
If the group collects enough signatures, the decision would be suspended and 
the council would have two options -- repealing the ordinance or calling a 
special election on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott say the council's 3-0 decision to shift elections might 
become moot anyway. They have challenged Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey's right 
to vote at Monday's meeting because they say he was no longer a Tustin resident 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
If a Superior Court rules in their favor Jan. 17, they say the council's 
decision would be subject to challenge because no quorum would have existed at 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey submitted a letter of resignation Tuesday because he is moving out of 
the city, but he maintains that he was still a Tustin resident at the time of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin is the first city in the county to move its election from November to 
April rather than vice versa. Most cities have consolidated local elections 
with November general elections. SHANNON SANDS

<P>
Reversing the Planning Commission, the City Council voted unanimously Tuesday 
to support a 10-acre tennis club and 53 adjacent condominiums near the corner 
of Camino Capistrano and Oso Road. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned because the project adjoins the flood plain of the Oso and Trabuco 
creeks, the council asked the developer to change the street and lot plan in 
order to locate homes farther away from the creeks and to bring the plan back 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the best we can hope to do," said Councilman Anthony L. Bland. "We 
have to look at the willingness of the developer to put something on a 
difficult piece of property." 
</P>
<P>
The project includes 22 lighted tennis courts, a 20,000-square-foot clubhouse, 
a public tennis academy, swimming pool and health spa adjoining a gated, 
six-acre neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The project, proposed by developer Cecil R. Bunnell and planned since 1986, 
previously drew criticism from city officials and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But the revised plan approved Tuesday night was supported by several residents 
who said the city needs a second tennis club. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission last month unanimously rejected the proposal because it 
included a plan to build 25 homes near Trabuco Creek, which is designated as 
permanent open space. WENDY PAULSON

FREEDOM'S NOT JUST ANOTHER BOWL FOR POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freedom Bowl VI already has announced its intentions -- if Indiana (V-V) beats 
Purdue (II-VIII) on Saturday, it will be Indiana vs. Washington on Dec. XXX -- 
and Cal State Fullerton is handling the news reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Thompson plays running back for Indiana. Among other things, Thompson 
broke the NCAA single-game rushing record by running for 377 yards against 
Wisconsin -- precisely one week after Fullerton's Mike Pringle tied the record 
with 357 yards against New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
That was cold, but bringing Thompson to Anaheim for his postseason moment of 
glory, where he can flaunt his stuff just a few off-ramps south of Titan Tech, 
is an out-and-out chill-out. 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame the Freedom Bowl, says Tom Starr, the game's executive director. 
All too well, we remember what happened the last time Fullerton did. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Starr picked Iowa and Texas as the contestants for Freedom I, thereby 
snubbing an undefeated Titan team, and Starr spent the next week screening 
phone calls and packages. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl Or Bust took on a twisted connotation as Starr had to plead for an 
end to the bomb threats from Fullerton boosters and a restoration of sanity. 
</P>
<P>
From such ugly beginnings, the Freedom Bowl has grown and developed, gained 
corporate sponsorship and a network television contract, and now sits on the 
brink of the previously unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
The Heisman could be coming to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the nation's leader in rushing (170 yards a game) and scoring (154 
points), is presently among the top three in most unofficial Heisman Trophy 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, of course, can tell you which polls Thompson is leading. 
</P>
<P>
"He's ahead in the Gannett (News Service) national poll, which consists of 17% 
of the Heisman voters," Starr says, throwing out the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy from the South Bend paper called me the other day and said they took a 
poll of their readers. Anthony Thompson was leading there, too -- and that's in 
the home of Notre Dame, Tony Rice country." 
</P>
<P>
In what's said to be a wide-open Heisman field, Rice and Houston's Andre Ware 
are said to be Thompson's primary competition. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Starr set his sights on Indiana, a .500 team that will 
probably finish fifth in the Big Ten and, along with Pac-10 also-ran 
Washington, give this Freedom Bowl the distinct look of a second-rate Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 10 years in the bowl business, I've never seen so much parity, aside 
from the teams headed for the New Year's Day bowls," Starr says. "So we said, 
'Heck, let's get a star performer out here, a guy the fans want to come out and 
see.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Freedom Bowl has to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana already has been extended a verbal invitation, but no team with a 
losing record can accept a postseason bowl bid. A loss to ninth-place Purdue, 
however unlikely, would leave the Hoosiers 5-6 and the Freedom Bowl in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
Right? 
</P>
<P>
Starr, who has never seen a half-empty glass of water in his life, just keeps 
smiling and informs you of his contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our backup team is Florida," Starr says. "And that means Emmitt 
Smith. So either way, we're going to get one of the two consensus All-American 
running backs." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but Heisman has that certain ring to it. Let Freedom ring, Starr says. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is very much star-oriented," he notes. "All you have to do is look 
at Wally Joyner, Bo Jackson, Jim Everett. People here want to see the star 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
"And with Anthony Thompson, the fans will be coming out and seeing history. 
He's the all-time leading scorer in college football. Any time he scores a 
touchdown, he'll be doing something O.J. Simpson or Eric Dickerson or Red 
Grange never did." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Freedom Bowl gets it the other way around. Usually, it gets the 
understudies, the futures, the teams on the verge. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the road to collegiate stardom first leads through Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's Chuck Long threw six touchdown passes in Freedom Bowl I. The next year, 
he placed a close second to Bo Jackson in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Chris Chandler was an obscure sophomore quarterback when he played 
in Freedom Bowl II. He won the MVP award in that game, went on to set many 
school passing records and became the Indianapolis Colts' starting quarterback 
as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
BYU's Ty Detmer also won a Freedom Bowl MVP trophy in last year's game against 
Colorado. Now he leads the nation in passing. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Colorado, the ultimate case study. Losers in Freedom V, the 
Buffaloes are now undefeated and rated second in both wire-service polls, 
headed for a national championship showdown with Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
For half a decade, the Freedom Bowl has been a warmup act disguised as a 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
But now, at age VI, the Preview Bowl is poised to become a prime-time bowl. All 
it needs is a Purdue loss this weekend and a heavy Hoosier turnout on Heisman 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to the Purdue game," Starr says. "Wild horses couldn't keep us 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he adds, laughing in the face of the worst-case scenario, "if 
Purdue's leading late, we might have to sneak out the press box elevator."

KELM'S RETURN GIVES DEFENSE NEEDED LIFT; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: AFTER BEING SIDELINED ALL SEASON WITH TORN LIGAMENTS IN HIS FOOT, HE'S 
BACK INSIDE TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE TEAM'S LINEBACKING CORPS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This Larry Kelm must be really good. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' inside middle linebacker, sidelined all season with a foot injury, 
returned to the lineup and the defense climbed eight notches in the league 
rankings while the team ended a four-game losing streak with a pair of routs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a superstar," linebacker Mel Owens said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe Owens was being a little coy, but Kelm is indeed a key player in the 
Rams' grand scheme. Hardly a star attraction, but important nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
If the Giants' Lawrence Taylor is sidelined, you can bet opponents and their 
fans will view the upcoming game with an increased sense of well-being. Kelm's 
absence was only noticed by a few offensive coordinators, some offensive 
linemen and maybe a few running backs. 
</P>
<P>
But when inside linebacker Fred Strickland sprained his ankle against the 
Buffalo Bills and missed the next three games, the Rams were forced to 
substitute with two linebackers -- Owens and rookie Frank Stams -- who had 
virtually no experience at the inside position. 
</P>
<P>
After eight seasons of facing tight ends as an outside linebacker, Owens found 
himself fending off the blocks of guards who outweighed him by 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Owens certainly feels better about his place in the puzzle now. "The pieces fit 
together much better now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is Kelm's first season as a starter, after serving a two-year 
apprenticeship under 13-year veteran Carl Ekern, who retired after last season. 
Kelm's hardly an old hand, but he was learning fast. And the Rams were counting 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember making the statement at the start of the year, like I was 
jinxing myself, that's the place we can't afford to lose anybody," Coach John 
Robinson said. "We didn't have any backups. Not only did we lose the two 
starters, but we were inadequate in depth." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm was out of action before the season opener, having injured his foot in an 
exhibition game against Phoenix. In two weeks, he was walking normally, but the 
extent of the damage -- it turned out to be torn ligaments -- was a mystery 
then. All Kelm knew was that he couldn't push off the foot to run. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months later, he returned after what has to be one of the longest 
"day-to-day" injuries on record. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelm had one of those injuries, 'Well, maybe he'll be back next week,' " 
Robinson said. "We kept pretending he'd be back. The residual effect is that it 
left us off-center in relation to our scheme and what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur, Ram defensive coordinator, bemoaned the loss of leadership and 
Kelm's ability as a signal caller. The Rams were frustrated, but no one more 
than Kelm. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really disappointing," he said. "This was supposed to be my year. The 
position was mine to lose. And I played well in preseason. I can't say enough 
about how bad it was to sit and watch for 10-11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustrating thing was that they couldn't really tell how serious it was 
when it happened. You've got the trainer telling you that it will be three, 
four weeks max. When it finally did start coming around, it was six or seven 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm was walking into meetings and then walking away while his teammates 
practiced. Then he read in the newspaper that he was out with a "bruised toe." 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough," he said. "I know sometimes coaches aren't too specific about 
injuries, but it's like people say, 'You're walking around, why can't you be 
out there running around?' 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted me out there more than me." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back and -- for the time being, anyway -- all's well with the Rams' 
defense. Kelm isn't about to take any credit, though. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel needed, I guess," he said. "But a lot of it has to do with 
the losing streak and guys just making up their minds that, 'Hey, we played 
good, but we didn't make the plays to win the game.' 
</P>
<P>
"All of it combined has this defense headed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
At least a few more Rams are playing in their comfort zones. Owens has returned 
to the outside and Kelm is back in the middle of things, doing what he does 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy like Lawrence Taylor exists in speed and distance and space," Robinson 
said. "An inside linebacker is more confined. Larry Kelm is like (recently 
retired Giants' linebacker) Harry Carson, a guy who performs in a small area." 
</P>
<P>
Life as an inside linebacker has its complications, but it really comes down to 
two things: reading and riding. That's reading the opponents' plays and riding 
off a block to make the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting reads comes from preparation and knowing what to look for," Kelm said. 
"Getting off blocks is the physical part of it. That's what I'm working on 
every day, because the linemen aren't getting any smaller, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Ekern is on hand as a volunteer assistant coach and is helping his protege 
learn to handle the big, and even bigger, boys. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl sticking around has really helped me," Kelm said. "He can fine-tune me. 
Preparation, knowing a lot about offenses, those are my strong points. That's 
why I thought this would be my year." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stewart got his first NFL interception and scored his first touchdown 
Sunday when he picked off a pass and returned it 41 yards to give the Rams a 
7-0 lead over Phoenix. Coach John Robinson said it has taken a while for 
Stewart to temper his instincts to play the run, but the third-year strong 
safety is becoming an all-around player. "It's been a long time getting him to 
say, 'Sometimes they pass,' "Robinson said. "His instincts are so aggressive. 
Early, we played him in that environment, which limited him. Now, you can give 
him the deep middle and he'll stay there. Those guys make the best safeties, 
though, the hunger to hit somebody and just enough caution." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Rams had run 14 offensive plays Sunday, they had a 21-0 lead. 
"We didn't have the ball much early and I was getting (mad). We got it and we 
scored," Robinson said. "Ideally, you would like to start the game off with a 
long drive that produces points and schedule the interception return (for a 
touchdown) sometime in the third quarter." . . . Getting Defensive: The Rams 
have held opponents to 32% (17 of 53) on third-down conversions over the past 
four games. In the past two games, opponents have averaged just 41 yards 
rushing.

SAN DIEGO SECTION PROVIDES GLIMPSE OF POSSIBILITIES FOR FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENCE: ORANGE COUNTY CAN LEARN FROM REGION THAT BROKE FROM SOUTHERN 
SECTION IN 1960. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Section of the California Interscholastic Federation is the 
state's best model of a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County were to leave the Southern Section one day, it should study 
San Diego's example closely. 
</P>
<P>
After all, an Orange County Section would be similar to the San Diego Section 
in many ways. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Diego County has 76 high schools; Orange County has 73. 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Diego County's population is 2.237 million; Orange County is 2.238 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Diego County has arenas suitable for championship events -- Jack Murphy 
Stadium (football and baseball) and the Sports Arena (basketball); Orange 
County has Anaheim Stadium (football and baseball) and UC Irvine's Bren Center 
(basketball). 
</P>
<P>
From 1913, when the Southern Section was founded, until 1959, San Diego schools 
competed as part of the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Before World War II, San Diego was a Navy town with little need or desire for 
its own section. After all, San Diego schools were holding their own. Their 
teams won championships with regularity, often beating schools from the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The roads were not clogged with cars then and travel wasn't the hardship it is 
today. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1950s, San Diego began to undergo great change. The city, like most 
of Southern California, boomed in the post-war years. As the population grew, 
more schools were needed. 
</P>
<P>
Soon there were 33 high schools -- enough for their own section, the folks in 
San Diego County figured. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1960, they split from the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a few initial headaches, the San Diego Section has been running 
smoothly ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The section's football and basketball championships are well-attended, even 
rivaling Southern Section title game crowds. 
</P>
<P>
The football championships draw about 12,000 to Jack Murphy Stadium and the 
basketball title games draw 7,000 to the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"If you asked most people, they wouldn't realize we were ever part of the 
Southern Section," said Kendall Webb, San Diego commissioner since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Webb and an assistant commissioner, an office manager and a financial secretary 
make up the section's staff. They work in a 60-by-12 foot trailer on the 
grounds of the San Diego Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the small staff, Webb says his office encounters little difficulty 
administrating the section. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're able to organize our activities easily," he said. "We have an 
experienced staff that's pretty knowledgeable. And we have advisory committees 
to help us (administer each sport)." 
</P>
<P>
In most ways the section is similar to the state's other nine sections. One 
difference is who governs it. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section is governed by the school district superintendents and 
not the principals, as in the Southern Section's case, or by the school board, 
as in the cases of the Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco sections. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Southern Section, the San Diego Section generates income from 
corporate sponsorship. It also earns money from playoff ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section has its own constitution and bylaws. The Southern Section 
calls it a Blue Book. San Diego calls it a Green Book. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Section would have to establish all of that before beginning 
operation.

<P>
There should be an Orange County Section for the same reason that birds kick 
their young out of the nest, that kids go away to college. 
</P>
<P>
It's time. Orange County has grown up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice arrangement while it lasted, the Southern Section helping to 
nurture the relatively young athletic programs of a relatively young region. 
But things have reached the point that Orange County is doing a lot of the 
nurturing -- with revenues, personnel, publicity and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In just under 20 years, the population of Orange County has increased from 
1,420,386 to 2,238,700. That makes it larger than San Diego County, which has 
its own section, and the 73 high schools that would be part of an Orange County 
Section would make it larger than five of the 10 existing sections. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a belief among some of the administrators in Orange County that the 
number of schools presently in Orange County and the number of schools that are 
expected to be built indicate the possibility of a very large (Southern) 
Section," said James Ryan, principal of Foothill High School. "There are some 
ideas to break it apart, mainly because of the size and unwieldiness of a large 
section. The need for that has increased in recent years as operating an 
athletic section has become more and more complex." 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenal interest here in prep sports causes local papers to give 
extensive coverage. Taken as a whole, interest in high schools sports in Orange 
County rivals interest in the Rams and Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section recognizes this, scheduling major championships in Anaheim 
Stadium (baseball and football), UC Irvine's Bren Center (basketball) and 
Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium (football) during the past school year. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section officials know that Orange County means above-average gate 
receipts because many of the section's top officials have worked, still work 
and live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The section's top official, Commissioner Stan Thomas, was principal at Foothill 
High School. Administrators Bill Clark and Karen Hellyer came from El Dorado 
and University high schools, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor principal Tom Jacobson is the president of the Southern Section 
Council. La Habra principal Tom Triggs and El Toro Athletic Director Sheri Ross 
are on the section's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
So, Orange County has the size, interest, facilities and the talented people to 
run its own athletic section. 
</P>
<P>
"All the money is here, all the facilities, it's an ideal setting," said Tom 
Danley, Katella athletic director. "Why wouldn't we want to be in control of 
our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Danley has been a proponent of an Orange County Section since the early 1970s, 
and the idea seems to gain strength every year. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, a committee of Orange County principals is looking into the 
feasibility of breaking away from the Southern Section, which, to many, has 
become unwieldy with 476 member schools. That's larger than 43 state athletic 
federations. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, it stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Nevada border, from 
Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevadas to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"For one staff to handle the needs of a great many high schools is a tough 
task," Ryan said. "There's a potential for some problems." 
</P>
<P>
To service that huge chunk of earth and humanity the Southern Section has two 
commissioners, two administrators and a handful of clerical help. Commissioners 
and administrators are there to answer questions by coaches or administrators 
about CIF rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it stands, there is only one official to every 119 schools. Figuring 
that the great majority of those schools have both boys' and girls' programs 
and field about 20 varsity sports, that means 2,380 varsity coaches per 
official. Rue the day when all of them are in an inquisitive mood. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the Southern Section has done a poor job, almost everyone agrees 
it's doing the best it can. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people figure, 'If it's not broke, why fix it?' " Danley said. "But 
the fact is, we could do better on our own." 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Section would have 73 members, and even with a smaller staff 
than the Southern Section -- say a commissioner and an administrator -- there 
would be a much more responsive staff to school needs. In these times of 
knee-jerk litigation caused usually by ignorance of the CIF's sometimes 
confusing rules, the value of this cannot be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of transportation. Once Southern Section playoffs 
begin, schools can find themselves traveling to the far reaches of the Southern 
Section's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Christian football team will play its second-round Division IX 
playoff game in Bishop, just outside of Mammoth. The team will begin the 
six-hour trip at 8:30 Friday morning and turn around that night and drive back. 
If it wins the game, Whittier Christian could find itself rewarded with a much 
shorter trip -- a three-hour excursion to Carpenteria. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm for anything that means I don't have to travel in a bus to Bishop," 
Whittier Christian Coach Phil Bravo said. "I would absolutely love having a 
county section. I think anyone who has had to take one of these long bus trips 
would agree." 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of Division IX, an Orange County Section could establish its own 
divisions, ridding itself of the watered-down and archaic nature of 11 
divisions for football and nine in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Three championship divisions in Orange County -- one for large schools, one for 
mid-size and one for small schools. That's it. Make a championship mean 
something, and with it establish even more passionate county rivalries, ones 
that go beyond leagues. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, most Orange County teams, coaches and fans care almost 
exclusively about other county teams. Orange County polls take precedent over 
Southern Section polls and out-of-county opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no problem getting kids up for games against teams in the league or teams 
around the county they've heard or read about," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. 
"But it's real hard for a kid to relate to Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
For all intents and purposes, Orange County already has divorced itself. For 
example, during the recently completed nonleague football season Orange 
County's major 58 high schools played nearly 300 opponents, and of those only 
46 were from out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few times in the past few years, the Southern Section has lost 
money on its traditional big moneymakers -- football and basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that playoffs played exclusively in Orange County, 
between Orange County teams, would be major draws. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be heavy-duty revenue," said Tony Ferruzzo, director of education 
for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District. "The history of Orange 
County athletics has been one of very healthy turnouts. I think that would only 
increase with an Orange County Section." 
</P>
<P>
Big playoff revenues defer the cost of running the section. One of the Southern 
Section's main selling points is that its size plus its aggressive procurement 
of corporate sponsorship has allowed it to keep its dues at a state-low 23 
cents per student. 
</P>
<P>
And an Orange County Section would mean building a facility and paying a staff, 
but Danley believes the potential for corporate sponsorship for an Orange 
County Section is "astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
Danley should know. Though the Southern Section starting accepting corporate 
sponsorship in 1976, it was Danley who pioneered the practice when he accepted 
sponsorship from a soft drink company a few years earlier with the Orange 
County Athletic Directors Assn., an organization he helped found. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see us eventually paying nothing," Danley said. "The Southern Section 
gets about $250,000 ($211,750 in 1988-89). I would think $1 million (corporate 
sponsorship) is perfectly realistic. I think the bottom line is if we were 
allowed to go out, run it ourselves, support it ourselves, we would prosper 
more."

Six consecutive points early in the third match ensured La Habra High School's 
volleyball team of a 15-7, 15-6, 15-7 victory over University High of San Diego 
in the opening round of the Southern California Volleyball Regional 
Championships Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (19-1) advances to the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Lisa Almanza, who had 34 assists, served the six consecutive points and 
the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept serving and the team worked together to get the ball over the net 
and not let any return balls drop," Almanza said. 
</P>
<P>
Said La Habra Coach Sandy Blumenthal: "Lisa is so terrific, she can make a set 
of any pass." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal cited good passing and excellent serving as the keys for La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
University Coach Robert Gorney said his San Diego Division II champions "didn't 
play as well as they could have; fundamentally they were really tight." 
University finished 19-3. 
</P>
<P>
Missy Clements (15 kills, three aces), Anna Kristich (13 kills), and Zrinka 
Kristich (10 kills, three aces) led La Habra.

The Orange Coast College men's soccer team hit a flat spot early in the season, 
but has since developed into one of the best community college teams in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, the Orange Empire Conference champions, begin play today in the 
Southern California Regionals. They play host to Moorpark in a 2 p.m. match. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the regional final Saturday against the winner of 
today's Glendale-East Los Angeles match. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another problem facing the Pirates today -- the health of forward 
Andy Strouse, the conference's most valuable player. Strouse, a freshman from 
Edison High School, scored 19 goals to help Orange Coast to a 14-4-2 overall 
record. 
</P>
<P>
He played all season with a sore left arm, and three weeks ago ligament damage 
was discovered. He had surgery two weeks ago and is questionable -- at best -- 
for today's match. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy was a big key to this team and we rely on him," Coach Laird Hayes said. 
"But if he can't go, then we'll just adjust. We have some other fine players as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Oldham, who scored a team-high 20 goals, was a member of the 
all-conference first team, as were teammates Rich Pethigal, Shaun Jarrard and 
Mike Sandel. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast went 6-3-1 in nonconference play, losing two consecutive matches. 
But the Pirates finished 8-1-1 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has allowed only 11 goals in its past 10 matches. STEVE KRESAL

IRVINE'S BIG SPLASH; 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO: ANTEATERS, RANKED SECOND IN NATION, HAVE HIGH HOPES ENTERING NCAA 
TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since 1985, UC Irvine has a realistic chance of winning the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. water polo championship. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Stanford defeated the Anteaters, 11-10, in overtime in the 
championship game. Irvine is back this time around with a veteran team that is 
ranked second in the nation heading into the NCAA championships, which will be 
Friday through Sunday in Indianapolis. The Anteaters are three victories away 
from the national championship, or, given the state of NCCA water polo, the 
California championship. 
</P>
<P>
California teams have dominated the NCAA water polo tournament since its 
inception in 1969. No other state has even had a team reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
But the NCAA tries hard each year to make sure the event is more than a state 
championship by inviting two non-California teams. The NCAA also makes periodic 
attempts to expose the sport to the outlanders, such as this year's final at 
Indianapolis, only the third time the event has been out of California. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Irvine (24-6), by virtue of its second seeding, draws 
Arkansas-Little Rock (19-2), the No. 7 seed and ranked 12th in the final poll, 
in Friday's first round. It allows the Anteaters an easier match before a 
likely meeting with No. 3-seeded Stanford in Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose to them (Arkansas-Little Rock), we shouldn't ever have been there," 
Irvine Coach Ted Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
Newland, in his 24th year at Irvine, said his team is among five with a chance 
to win in the field of eight. Newland said any team can win among top-seeded 
California (24-3), Stanford (26-7), and Big West Conference tri-champions No. 2 
Irvine (24-6), No. 4 Pepperdine (23-6) and No. 5 Cal State Long Beach (18-8). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has beaten each of those teams at least once, but it also has lost to 
each of them at least once. Two of the Anteaters' three matches with Cal have 
been decided by a single goal. 
</P>
<P>
Newland, who has coached the Anteaters into 17 of the 20 previous NCAA 
tournaments and to two championships, said the title will go to the team that 
gets hot at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to be up for every game," Newland said. "We are going to 
have to do everything right because it is so damn close." 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters have Chris Duplanty, who stopped 245 shots on goal during the 
regular season and was the backup goalie for the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, which 
won the silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' offense is led by seniors Tom Warde, Julian Harvey and Dan 
Smoot, who have scored 92, 75 and 54 goals, respectively, this season. 
</P>
<P>
UCI KEY PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
Chris Duplanty 
</P>
<P>
In goal for the Anteaters is Chris Duplanty, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound, senior from 
Honolulu, the reserve goalkeeper for the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. One of three 
Irvine players to be a first-team All-Big West Conference selection, Duplanty 
is likely the best goalkeeper at the collegiate level, Coach Ted Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Warde 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's leading scorer with 92 goals, Tom Warde, a 6-1, 185-pound senior from 
Pacifica High School is another all-conference player. Newland said Warde, who 
usually sets the hole for the Anteaters, is the strongest player he has ever 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Harvey 
</P>
<P>
At 6-2 and 190 pounds, Julian Harvey, a senior from Laguna Hills High School is 
Irvine's second-leading scorer with 75 goals. Harvey, who also was named to the 
all-conference team, is a member of the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Smoot 
</P>
<P>
A senior from Tustin High School, scored 54 goals this season and was a 
second-team all-conference selection. Newland said Smoot, 6-1, 170, is among 
the teams' faster swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
Water polo is a simple game: two teams try to score by throwing a rubber ball 
into the opponent's goal. A team consists of a goalie and six field players. 
The goalie can handle the ball with two hands, but the field players must use 
only one hand at a time. A player can swin up to two miles per game. A game 
consists of four seven-minute quarters. 
</P>
<P>
TYPES OF FOULS 
</P>
<P>
The referee must immediately decide whether to call a violation or whether to 
let it go, depending on the intensity of the foul. Listed below are some of the 
minor and major fouls. 
</P>
<P>
1. Ordinary fouls: Preventing free movement of an opponent (unless holding the 
ball), and when they occur a free pass is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
2. Major fouls: Pulling an offensive player back with two hands. The player 
receives a 45-second ejection from the game. 
</P>
<P>
3. Major fouls: Sinking an offensive player is a major foul and the player is 
ejected for 45 seconds. This gives the offensive team a one-man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The ball: A water polo ball is basically the same size and shape as a 
volleyball. It is made of yellow rubber for greater visibility.

FORMER EMPLOYEES WIN SETTLEMENT IN PENSION FUND SUIT

<P>
Eighteen employees of the defunct Adams Insulation Co. of Santa Ana have 
received $427,366 in a settlement of a lawsuit alleging that owners of the 
company illegally used its employee pension fund to their personal advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor announced last week that it had settled its 
lawsuit against Rodney and Judith Adams. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed Dec. 4, 1986, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
accused the Adamses of violating their fiduciary responsibilities under the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
</P>
<P>
Among the activities that the Labor Department disapproved of were three loans 
totaling $1.4 million that the Adamses made to themselves from the pension 
fund's assets in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department claimed that the loans were not adequately secured and did 
not bear reasonable rates of interest. Moreover, the Adamses were accused of 
improperly allowing the pension plan to accept an interest in real property 
owned by the Adamses in lieu of cash payments of interest that became due on 
the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Teehan, the regional solicitor representing the Labor Department in the 
case, said the Adamses agreed to the settlement "without admitting or denying 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
"Employees are getting back 100% on the dollar. There are no losses," said 
Robert A. Levinson, attorney for Adams Insulation.

Desperately Seeking Nannies: A company that specializes in recruiting 
"All-American" nannies from small Midwest and Northwest towns opened two months 
ago in El Toro and already has more requests for nannies than it can readily 
fill, owner Anne Leets said. 
</P>
<P>
"Child care is a big issue for working parents," said Leets, the founder of 
All-American Childcare Agency. 
</P>
<P>
She said the live-in nannies she places accept salaries at the going rate in 
Southern California, ranging from $150 to $250 a week plus room and board. But 
she said the family employer also must pay for transportation to bring them 
from their home towns. 
</P>
<P>
Leets said that since she founded her agency in September, she has placed close 
to 30 nannies throughout Orange County. "Right now I have three clients for 
every nanny I can find," she said.

NICHOLS OPENS DRUG TESTING LAB IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nichols Institute Substance Abuse Testing Laboratories of San Juan 
Capistrano is responding to increasing corporate demand for drug testing with 
the opening of a 17,000-square-foot facility in San Diego exclusively for 
business clients. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President Gary Hibler said the San Diego center has been screening 
workers and job applicants for its client companies since July. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for drug testing outgrew the capabilities of the American Clinical 
Laboratories, another Nichols Institute-owned facility in San Diego that 
previously conducted screenings in that county, Hibler said. 
</P>
<P>
This month's opening of the Nichols Institute lab and its singular role 
exemplify the increasing acceptance of drug-testing programs by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1988 national household survey by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, 14.5 million people ages 12 and over reported using illegal drugs. Of 
those, 70% had full- or part-time jobs, said Jeanne G. Trumble, chief of the 
workplace policy research branch of the Rockville, Md.-based institute, which 
is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has developed guidelines for the testing of federal employees and 
set standards on how they should be tested. Since the standards were 
established in April, 1988, the institute has certified 37 laboratories -- 
including the new facility -- as competent to test federal workers and 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The standards cover the experience and expertise of testing personnel, 
confidentiality and the security of testing and reporting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that so many drug users are in the workplace, screening 
provides an excellent way to identify these troubled workers," Trumble said. 
"Of course, this could lead to termination, but most programs have 
rehabilitation programs. By catching these workers, you have a greater chance 
of making them productive employees again." 
</P>
<P>
Some labor unions also support testing workers suspected of using drugs -- as 
long as companies sponsor rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Greater accuracy and increased confidentiality made testing more palatable to 
unions," said Tom Rankin, a lobbyist for the California Labor Federation, which 
represents all unions in the state that are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin said unions have also become more receptive to screening because it 
helps increase safety in the workplace and reduce worker's compensation costs. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are still opposed to blanket, across-the-board mandatory testing and 
random testing of workers," he said. "Testing someone whose performance seems 
to be affected by drugs is understandable. But testing workers without cause is 
an unconstitutional invasion of an individual's privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of cases testing employers' rights to conduct random drug tests are 
now before the courts, Trumble said. 
</P>
<P>
Although permitting random testing remains controversial, there is a trend 
toward testing job applicants, workers who have been involved in accidents and 
employees who raise a "reasonable suspicion" of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"If governments encourage random testing and the courts allow it, you can 
easily be looking at a $200- to $300-million market in the next three to five 
years," said Kenneth C. Bohringer, a senior analyst at Prudential-Bache 
Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratories certified by NIDA require that urine specimens be screened using 
an immunoassay method, a procedure that uses antibodies to identify the 
presence of drugs. If a specimen tests positive, a "confirmation" is made using 
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) -- a procedure that unmistakably 
identifies a drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The screening simply tells you, for example, that opiates are present in the 
specimen," said Hibler of the Nichols Institute. "But the GC/MS tells you, 
'Yes, there is codeine,' or, 'Yes, there is morphine,' (two types of opiates) 
and tells you how much was found." 
</P>
<P>
In a positive test, the results are passed on to a medical review officer -- a 
physician with expertise in pharmacology -- who reviews the test and contacts 
the employee to determine if perhaps a medical prescription -- and not illegal 
drug use -- could be the cause. The review officer works as an independent 
third party and passes on the results to the employer. 
</P>
<P>
Such a process is required only when laboratories are conducting tests for 
federal employees. But Hibler said the federal standards have become accepted 
as the way of doing business in the private sector, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The accuracy of testing was a problem at first, mostly because labs were only 
screening, but now a second confirmation step is clearly the accepted 
practice," Hibler said. "People can lose their jobs because of this. You better 
have a product that will stand up in court." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the Nichols Institute lab charges $30 per screening. Confirmation of 
a particular drug could cost $60 more. Among NISAT's clients are Westinghouse, 
the American Maritime Assn., Science Applications International, Rescue 
Industries and Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, founded in 1971, reported revenue of $90.7 million for fiscal 1988, 
up from $55.2 million in 1987.

SAFETY GROUPS BLAST U.S. AIR-BAG EFFORTS

<P>
Three auto safety groups accused the federal government Tuesday of failing to 
promote and enforce air-bag rules, but a government highway safety spokesman 
countered that passenger safety remains its top priority. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters also issued a 
"report card" on air bags that gave failing grades to all but four auto 
manufacturers for laxity in installation of the passenger-protection devices. 
</P>
<P>
The auto safety groups gave Chrysler the highest score on its "report card" of 
the 12 major manufacturers selling cars in the United States, followed by 
Mercedes. Ford and Volvo tied for third. All other auto makers "failed." 
</P>
<P>
Ranking at the bottom, after General Motors, were Toyota, Volkswagen, Mazda, 
Nissan, Honda, Hyundai and Subaru. 
</P>
<P>
The groups said the rankings were based on the number of 1990 models equipped 
with the safety devices as standard equipment, plans for future installation of 
air bags, protection devices used in all seating positions of cars, information 
provided to dealers and the contents of company ads. 
</P>
<P>
The groups estimated that nearly one-third of the 10 million 1990 cars to be 
sold in the United States will be equipped with driver's-side air bags, 
compared to about 400,000 for the 1989 models. A new rule of the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires that all 1990-model cars must 
provide either a driver's air bag or lap-and-shoulder belts that automatically 
encircle both front-seat occupants. 
</P>
<P>
"NHTSA's engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags," said Joan Claybrook, 
head of Public Citizen. She said the administration, which she once headed, 
should promote air bags and closely monitor their use to perfect the several 
systems being installed. Claybrook said the agency should conduct its crash 
tests at higher speeds and upgrade its standards to mandate air bags for small 
vans as well as cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dumbfounded and mystified by her criticism," said administration 
spokesman Barry McCahill. Promotion of all types of occupant protection systems 
has been made the agency's "No. 1 priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCahill said the agency's decision to allow manufacturers the option of 
installing air bags on the driver's side in combination with automatic belts on 
the passenger side initially has accelerated the program. Eventually, 
passenger-side air bags will also be required, he said.

WACHS, POLICE URGE CONTINUED BARRICADE OF SEPULVEDA AREA

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs and police officials today called on the 
council to let barricades thrown up around a 12-square-block Sepulveda 
neighborhood remain standing to keep out drive-by drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the program has been so successful that the streets should be 
permanently closed off, allowing residents and guests to enter only through a 
guard station at Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which would have to approve permanently removing the streets 
from public use, was scheduled today to consider an interim measure introduced 
by Wachs that would keep the roadblocks up as long as police deem necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 council members said last week that they support the idea -- 
and two said they are considering it -- but some have reservations about the 
impact on nearby areas. Last week, police officials conceded that narcotics 
activity has increased in nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Joel Wachs, Ernani Bernardi, Hal Bernson, Mike Woo, Gloria 
Molina, Zev Yaroslavsky and Robert Farrell said they support the proposal.

Snow, dense fog and ice-covered roads slowed many people heading home for 
Thanksgiving today, one of the heaviest travel days of the year with people 
packing highways, buses, trains and planes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of fog on the West Coast and snow in the Midwest, the Federal Aviation 
Administration implemented a nationwide air traffic quota system early in the 
day, keeping planes on the ground until weather improved near their 
destinations, said Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United Airlines in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to get everybody over the river and through the woods to 
grandma's house, but they have to be patient," said Tom Troske, operations 
manager at Salt Lake City's airport, which was socked in by heavy fog part of 
the day.

BABY, ABANDONED IN SANTA ANA, LISTED IN GOOD CONDITION AT UCI

<P>
A newborn boy dubbed "Adam" is in good condition at UCI Medical Center today 
after he was found abandoned near a trash can by police investigating a 
stabbing on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
The unclothed baby, believed to be about four hours old, had turned blue and 
was gasping for air when Santa Ana Police Officer Michael Buelna found him just 
before midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buelna performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the infant, who was rushed to 
UCI Medical Center in Orange suffering from hypothermia, hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Buelna had been called to an apartment in the 1200 block of Brooks Street to 
investigate a stabbing when a neighbor approached the officer and told him she 
had heard a baby crying nearby. No one was seriously wounded in the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
The baby is believed to have been born prematurely, weighs just over 4 pounds 
and has brown hair and brown eyes, said hospital spokeswoman Elaine Beno.

66 ARRESTED DURING EL SALVADOR PROTEST AT L.A. FEDERAL BUILDING

<P>
Activist-actor Martin Sheen and several clergymen were among 66 people arrested 
this morning during a demonstration at the downtown Federal Building protesting 
U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 protesters gathered at 8 a.m., many locking arms as they sat in front 
of the building's westside doors. 
</P>
<P>
Nine protesters lay down at the building's entrance and were covered with 
sheets splattered with red paint. Others placed chains and padlocks on door 
handles to try to keep employees from entering the building. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested protesters were cited for trespassing on federal property and 
released on $25 bail, said Mary Filippini, a spokeswoman for the Federal 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
Many clergymen, including Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony, attended the 
demonstration to protest the recent killing of six Jesuit priests and two women 
in El Salvador. The demonstrators were protesting U.S. aid to the Salvadoran 
government in its fight against leftist rebels.

AMERICAN AIRLINES DENIES IT LET PASSENGERS VOTE TO BRAVE STORM

<P>
American Airlines today denied a published report that the pilot of a New 
York-bound flight let the passengers vote on whether to fly into a storm. 
</P>
<P>
The crew did ask for a show of hands from passengers aboard Flight 492 from 
Chicago to LaGuardia last week but it was to determine how many passengers 
wanted to return immediately to Chicago once the flight landed at another 
airport -- Stewart Airport outside Newburgh in the Hudson Valley -- to which it 
had been diverted, spokesman Tom Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision had already been made to divert (the flight). That was never a 
decision in the passengers' hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Sun-Times reported in today's editions that passengers on the 
flight last Thursday were asked by the pilot while in the air whether they 
wanted to return to O'Hare or continue their journey in view of storms that 
were sweeping the East Coast and South. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the passengers voted to take their chances on the storm and 
wound up being diverted to Newburgh, where a tornado that day smashed into a 
school cafeteria wall, killing eight students.

The Communist Party chief for Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second largest 
city, has been fired like his Moscow counterpart in a new move aimed at wooing 
voters before local elections in March. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Gidaspov was given the post of city party chief, replacing Anatoly 
Gerasimov, the party newspaper Pravda reported today. Gidaspov retains his job 
of regional party leader. 
</P>
<P>
The move followed a plenum of the Leningrad party committee Tuesday, when 
Moscow's party chief, Politburo hard-liner Lev Zaikov, was also ousted. 
</P>
<P>
Gidaspov was elected Leningrad regional party chief in July in an attempt to 
restore the city leadership's authority after several local officials were 
defeated in spring elections to the national Parliament.

The country's five largest cities retained their rankings in the Census 
Bureau's latest estimates of city populations but San Diego replaced Detroit as 
the nation's sixth largest city. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau said that San Jose and Jacksonville, Fla., also moved up in 
the rankings of the country's 25 largest cities in a new report released today. 
</P>
<P>
New York City ranked No. 1 in population in 1988 followed by Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, the same positions these cities held in 
1986, the last time the bureau estimated city populations. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth largest city while San 
Jose passed San Francisco and Indianapolis to move into 12th place. In the 
other change in the top 25, Jacksonville replaced Washington, D.C., as the 16th 
largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, there have been major shifts in the ranking of the most populous 
cities, with many in the East and Midwest being replaced by cities in the South 
and West. Seven of the 10 largest cities in 1970 were in the North and East but 
by 1988 there were only four in these regions. Baltimore, Washington and 
Cleveland had been replaced by San Diego, San Antonio and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lost population from 1986 
to 1988, including Houston, Dallas and Denver. Dallas' population loss dropped 
the city under 1 million, a level Dallas had reached for the first time in 
1986.

LORENZO LAUDS BUSH FOR STRIKE PROBE VETO;

MACHINISTS: PRESIDENT'S ACTION ANGERS ORGANIZED LABOR, PARTICULARLY THE UNIONS

As Eastern Airlines pilots denounced President Bush, the airline released a 
letter today sent to him from Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, thanking 
him for political courage in vetoing legislation to create a special 
congressional panel to investigate the 8-month-old strike against Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's veto angered organized labor and particularly Eastern's unions. "By 
failing to sign the Eastern bill the President embraced the meanest 
worker-hating boss in the nation -- Lorenzo," George Kourpias, president of the 
striking machinists union, said today. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from Lorenzo, who heads Eastern's parent company, commended the 
President for "a clear vision of the need to keep the airline industry 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the bill late Tuesday night, Bush said Congress was improperly 
trying to interfere in contract and court disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"This would hinder saving Eastern Airlines and the jobs of its employees," Bush 
said in a statement accompanying his veto. The White House announced the action 
less than 30 minutes before the midnight Tuesday deadline for the President to 
act or allow the measure to become law without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said it was unrealistic to believe that the commission could find a 
solution to the bitter strike within the 45 days called for in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
He also said any intervention by Congress would interfere with Eastern's 
attempts to reorganize in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor lobbied heavily for the measure, and several union leaders said 
a Bush veto would sour labor's already strained relations with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"It is utterly disgraceful that the Administration goes out of its way to 
support and identify with workers in Poland, China and Eastern Europe, yet it 
isn't even willing to hear what a congressional fact-finding commission might 
have to say about the 8-month-old strike at Eastern," said Skip Copeland, head 
of the striking Eastern pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Assn., called Bush's veto "a 
deliberate slap at American workers." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Bush has acted to keep the government out of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
He refused in March to use his power to block the strike by naming an emergency 
mediation board, saying he believed that the dispute should be settled by the 
company and its unions. 
</P>
<P>
Congress did not attempt a veto override as both houses rushed through other 
business and adjourned for the year early today. But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) said he will try to bring the measure up again when Congress returns 
in January.

Thousands of Boeing workers returned to the assembly line today after a 48-day 
strike, picking up a $500 bonus check won in their new contract and relieved to 
be earning money as the holiday season begins. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like the first day of school," said Jerry Clark, a 42-year-old father 
of two, as he showed up at Boeing's plant in Renton, where he builds plane 
models for the world's No. 1 manufacturer of passenger jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to go back. If it were another time of year it would be different," 
said Tracy Dorning, an electrical inspector at Renton. "We might have stayed 
out longer." 
</P>
<P>
The second-longest strike in Boeing history had practically shut down 
production. Supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered 24 planes, but 
many of the aircraft had been virtually completed before the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said most of today will be spent in meetings to 
organize the start-up. 
</P>
<P>
Gearing up is "going to be slow," he said. "It will not happen overnight."

Some South Korean banks are preparing to lend money to cash-strapped China 
after Japanese and Western institutions pulled out of the market following the 
June 4 crackdown, Korean bankers in Hong Kong said today. 
</P>
<P>
Although China and South Korea have had no diplomatic ties since 1950 when 
China intervened on the side of North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, the move 
is already under way.

FACTORY ORDERS FALL, TRIGGERING RECESSION FEARS

Orders to U.S. factories for "big ticket" durable goods fell 0.6% in October, 
the second consecutive monthly decline, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- items expected to last 
three or more years -- dipped to a seasonally adjusted $124.59 billion last 
month after a 1.1% drop in September. 
</P>
<P>
Although the October decline had been expected, the real surprise was a sharp 
revision to the orders number for September, which a month ago had been 
reported as a small increase of 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back declines in orders provided fresh evidence that the U.S. 
manufacturing sector is facing a severe slowdown. Many economists are 
forecasting that the country will dip close to a recession in the coming six 
months as a slump in manufacturing spills over into the rest of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the weakness has been in the auto industry, where weak sales have 
prompted layoffs and production cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
For October, transportation orders rose by 3% to $33.54 billion, recouping some 
of a giant 10.8% drop in September. 
</P>
<P>
However, the October strength came from increased demand for military ships and 
civilian aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles were down again. 
</P>
<P>
The total demand for defense equipment fell by 12.4% to $9.33 billion. However, 
this followed a huge 33.9% increase in military orders in September. 
</P>
<P>
The September advance had originally been reported as an even larger 60% 
increase, but the Commerce Department said changes in the original company 
reports triggered a big downward revision that transformed the overall 
September figure from a small positive to the big decline.

Victoria Principal prepared for her role as a blind woman in a Sunday 
made-for-television movie by wearing a blindfold for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I cooked dinner blindfolded, I baked, I made sandwiches, I scrambled eggs, ate 
meals, and I even tended to business at my office with my eyes covered," said 
the former star of CBS's "Dallas" in an interview with TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
In the ABC movie "Blind Witness," Principal plays a determined blind woman who 
avenges her husband's murder. During filming in Utah, she wore special contact 
lenses that distorted her vision and made her legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to memorize all my locations before we shot a scene," said Principal, 
who was also executive producer for the movie. "I would count every step and 
practice moving to my marks over and over again because I couldn't see my 
marks."

For Alexander Oseichuk, who remembers when Josef Stalin banned saxophones in 
the 1950s, it was a dream come true to be trading riffs with American sax 
legend Joe Henderson. Oseichuk and three other Soviet jazzmen, who learned most 
of what they know of American jazz by listening to records, found themselves 
recently jamming with the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
The Igor Bril Quartet, an all-star collection of musicians from the Soviet 
Union, played in three concerts with American jazz greats Bobbie Hutcherson and 
Joe Henderson, and there was amazement on both sides over the way they jelled. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd never know these guys hadn't been together for a long time," said Gerry 
Pearlman, the American promoter of the concerts in San Francisco, Stanford 
University and Mill Valley. "They were trading off wonderfully." 
</P>
<P>
Vibes virtuoso Hutcherson said he was impressed with the musicianship of the 
Soviet players, who included pianist Bril, Oseichuk on the saxophone, Victor 
Dvoskin on bass and Eugene Ryaboy on drums.

Isabella Hofmann says although millions of people watch her every week on the 
NBC comedy "Dear John," she is the "Queen of Anonymity" when she walks down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who plays Kate McCarron on the show about a singles' support 
group, says in TV Guide that she never gets stared at or stopped for 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, she described a recent lunch with her manager in a trendy Los 
Angeles restaurant. The waitress said the restaurant owner wanted to send her a 
dessert on the house. Hofmann said she could not figure out why. 
</P>
<P>
"My manager said, 'Now Isabella, please. You're in a hit show, and people just 
do this sort of thing.' And I said, 'No, you know how it is with me. No one 
ever recognizes me. Something's wrong, you watch.' . . . Then the owner came 
over and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry. The waitress had the wrong table.' "

Sculptor Isabel McIlvain is closing in on the moment of truth for her 
8-foot-tall portrayal of John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze, the final step before its 
unveiling outside the Massachusetts Capitol as the formal memorial to a beloved 
native son. 
</P>
<P>
For older generations, the heroic image will recall the optimism and vigor 
embodied by Kennedy. For generations born since the young President was slain 
on Nov. 22, 1963, the statue offers a glimpse of the era known as Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
"My wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and who had a lot of 
youth, a lot of hope about his role and the possibilities for America," said 
McIlvain, a professor of sculpture at Boston University. McIlvain's work, which 
will take about six months to cast, depicts Kennedy in a classic pose -- 
striding into a breeze, eyes forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked 
into his suit pocket. The finished $175,000 sculpture, which has been paid for 
through donations from citizens' groups and schoolchildren, is scheduled for 
unveiling May 29, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd birthday.

President Bush has a place in history. Now he's on the map. A small island near

<P>
President Bush Island, four uninhabited acres of ledge, rocks and woods, is 
located along a route often traveled by Bush when he is boating and fishing 
during his vacations in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
The island, formerly Green Island, was named for Bush by a couple who have 
known Bush and his family for years. 
</P>
<P>
"My father and his grandfather were good friends," Elizabeth Milligan said 
Tuesday from her winter home in Florida. "Our families have known each other

Kennebunkport named after the President."

LIZ SMITH: KIM BASINGER SWINGS FROM 'BATMAN' TO 'ENEMY'

<P>
"NEVER GIVE UP; and never under any circumstances, no matter what, never face 
the facts," said Ruth Gordon, the heroine of "Harold and Maude." 
</P>
<P>
KIM BASINGER, who made Michael Keaton's blood boil in "Batman," has been signed 
for her first film since the release of that mega-hit (now out on cassette and 
reaping millions more for Warners). Kim will star in Leonard Goldberg's 
production, "Sleeping With the Enemy," described as "a contemporary sexual 
thriller." This will be Goldberg's first independent production since leaving 
his position as president of 20th Century Fox Film Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's leading man has yet to be cast, but the sexy actress will have firm 
support behind the camera. The screenplay for "Sleeping With the Enemy" has 
been written by Ron Bass, last year's Oscar winner for "Rainman." The director 
will be Joe Rubin, whose most recent effort was "True Believers." Shooting 
begins March 1, with Goldberg's alma mater, Fox, releasing in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
THE LATE John Lennon, like Marilyn and Elvis, is perennially hot copy; there's 
a reading public that snaps up everything on him. This is one reason why 
Lennon's son, Julian, is shopping around a book he's writing on his father. 
Although father and son were not particularly close until near the end of 
John's life, the book will nevertheless deal with their relationship, such as 
it was. So far, Julian hasn't found a publisher willing to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
FANS OF Michael J. Fox will not be disappointed by his performance in the 
eagerly awaited "Back to the Future II," opening today. 
</P>
<P>
Fox throws himself energetically into the reprise of his Marty McFly role. He 
is still boyish and appealing. Admirers of the first film, however, might be in 
for a letdown. Much of the charm of the original has vanished; this "Future" is 
violent, mean-spirited, strained and, under the direction of Bob Zemeckis, 
occasionally incoherent. Christopher Lloyd, so funny the first time around as 
the daffy scientist, is here simply annoying. 
</P>
<P>
Given the result, not only was this sequel unnecessary, but the third 
installment, filmed at the same time and due for release next summer, seems 
nothing more than an obvious attempt to squeeze every last drop and every 
possible dollar from a movie (and an audience) that deserves a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIE STAR and expectant father Arnold Schwarzenegger has moved into the 
ionosphere of high-salaried actors. Arnold will collect $10 million, plus a 
percentage of the profits, from his next film, "Total Recall." But please, 
don't mention this to Meryl Streep. The great actress spouted off rather 
profanely to Premiere magazine on the unequal salaries of men and women 
superstars in Hollywood. Meryl's not starving, but fair is fair. Still, men 
always make more money than women in Hollywood, and in most other places. 
</P>
<P>
BALTHAZAR GETTY, the handsome 14-year-old son of John Paul Getty III, has 
landed a key role in Martin Poll's new movie, "Home Grown," playing Kate 
Capshaw's son. Young Balthazar was discovered a couple of years ago in a 
Bel-Air prep school and cast in the remake of "Lord of the Flies." Martin Poll 
says Getty is "a terrific talent who'll go far in films."

"I don't plan to move there tomorrow, but the possibility is there that I might 
move one day. In the meantime, I might use it as sort of a little getaway on

An off-duty police officer, the brother and former bodyguard of television star 
Mr. T, shot and wounded a man who tried to rob him at a South Side currency 
exchange, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Gustave J. Tero, a patrolman assigned to the Police Training 
Academy, was waiting to cash his paycheck Tuesday when two men tried to rob 
him, police said. Tero's brother, Lawrence (Mr. T) Tero, played a tough law 
enforcer with a trademark shaved head in television's "The A Team." 
</P>
<P>
Tero struggled with the two robbers and chased one of them into a nearby alley, 
Cmdr. Toby Burton said. Tero struggled with the man again and shot him in the 
legs, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
The second robber and a getaway driver fled and are still at large, Burton 
said. The wounded man was hospitalized in fair condition. The police 
department's Office of Professional Standards is investigating the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gustave Tero had once served as a bodyguard for Lawrence but was fired after a 
year. He sued his brother in 1984 to recoup $72,000 in damages and salary he 
claimed he lost for taking a year off from the department.

The world hockey championship, which was not contested in Olympic years during

figures say. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal won widespread support during a recent International Ice Hockey 
Federation congress in Zurich, Switzerland, and is expected to be formally 
adopted at meetings during the 1990 world championship in Bern, Switzerland, 
next April. 
</P>
<P>
The return to annual world tournaments was spurred by the International Olympic 
Committee's decision to hold Winter Games in 1992 then again in 1994, as part

PUCKETT IS FIRST TO SCORE $3-MILLION SALARY

Kirby Puckett became the first baseball player to break the $3-million average 
annual salary barrier, agreeing today to a three-year contract for $9 million 
with the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Andy MacPhail, the Twins general manager, and Ron Shapiro, Puckett's agent, 
reached an outline of the deal Tuesday night and were to sign a memorandum of 
agreement today. 
</P>
<P>
"With the wild escalation in player salaries we've seen the last 12 months, and 
recognizing the importance of Kirby Puckett to the team, we felt it was 
important we got him signed," MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett gets a $1.5 million signing bonus, of which $500,000 will be paid 
immediately, $500,000 on Dec. 15, 1990, and $500,000 on Dec. 15, 1991. He gets 
a $2.2 million salary in 1990, $2.5 million in 1991 and $2.8 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
For purposes of determining salaries, signing bonuses are prorated over the 
length of a contract. Puckett will be at $3 million in 1991, the same year Orel 
Hershiser of the Dodgers and Frank Viola of the Mets are scheduled to crack the 
$3 million single-year barrier (both will be at $3,166,667). Puckett's $3.3 
million in 1992 is the highest salary ever agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Puckett would get a $200,000 bonus for winning a Gold Glove, 
$200,000 for winning American League MVP and $100,000 for finishing second or 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The deal continued the rapid escalation of salaries that has taken place in the 
past two weeks. Outfielder Kevin Bass agreed to a three-year, $5.25-million 
deal with San Francisco, pitcher Pascual Perez agreed to a three-year, 
$5.7-million contract with the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals' 
Bret Saberhagen got a three-year, $8.9-million extension from the Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett, a 28-year-old center fielder who has been on the AL All-Star team for 
four consecutive seasons, would have been eligible for free agency after the 
1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
He hit .339 in 1989 with nine home runs and 85 RBIs, becoming the first 
right-handed hitter to win a full-season American League batting title since 
Alex Johnson of California in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
He made $2.05 million in 1989, including $50,000 in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
With the way the market is moving, Puckett may have been able to get a more 
lucrative deal if he had waited until after free agent pitchers Mark Langston 
and Mark Davis had signed. 
</P>
<P>
"He and we set a goal," Shapiro said. "He's not the kind of person who looks 
over his shoulder at what the next guy will make."

Charles Barkley, the Philadelphia 76ers' high-scoring forward, has been fined 
$5,000 by the NBA for his conduct during a game against the Orlando Magic, the 
league said today. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley was fined for "verbal abuse of a referee and failing to leave the court 
in a timely fashion after he had been ejected from the game," Rod Thorn, NBA 
vice president of operations, said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley was ejected after being called for his second technical foul, with 32 
seconds remaining in Saturday night's 116-103 Orlando victory over 
Philadelphia.

EVEN A BERTH IN THE WORLD CUP CAN'T PUT U.S. ON A SOCCER KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If he lived in almost any other country, Paul Caligiuri wouldn't have to buy a 
beer for the rest of his life. The bartender would always beat him to it. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri is a soccer player from Diamond Bar, and Sunday he scored a goal that 
put his country in the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. Such a feat 
would make him a sporting legend in almost any country except the one where he 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
That is the United States, and even though his left-footed shot made soccer 
history, most Americans still don't know his name. Soccer may cause riots 
elsewhere and stir more passion than any other game in the world, but most 
Americans prefer not to watch unless their kids are playing. 
</P>
<P>
In Trinidad, where Caligiuri scored his goal and ruined the home team's hopes 
of becoming the smallest country to play in the Cup, the game was treated as an 
epochal event. A national holiday was declared. Fans filled the stadium hours 
before kickoff. Such reaction is a worldwide tradition. 
</P>
<P>
There was less excitement in the States -- almost none, to be specific. The 
game was televised on tape and cable, opposite pro football, no doubt to a 
small audience. The victory did not result in network bulletins, as it did in 
Italy, where the Cup will be played next summer. Had the game been in the 
United States, it probably would not have drawn 20,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri's goal should help matters. Playing in the Cup will raise the soccer 
consciousness of the American public, and the United States is now assured of 
playing in the next two; the Cup will be played in the United States in 1994, 
and the home team automatically qualifies. There will be no problem finding 
sponsors, a concern that might have forced the national team to disband 
temporarily had it not won Sunday and qualified for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The hardy souls still trying to sell the game here will, surely, pronounce the 
victory as the start of something big. They do have reason to be excited. 
Staging a World Cup in the United States will focus tremendous attention on 
their game. They could attract millions of fans. 
</P>
<P>
It is debatable how high the public's soccer consciousness can go, however. The 
sport has been stuck at a curious station in America for some time now: 
Millions of kids are playing, but no one wants to pay to watch pros. This quirk 
has existed for so long that it is beginning to seem permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Youth soccer has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, all but rubbing out 
football as a game for youngsters. The reasons are obvious. It's relatively 
safe, it's good exercise, and everyone gets to kick the ball. But this 
popularity hasn't spawned a ticket-buying public. The one league that had some 
success, the North American Soccer League, folded. An indoor league remains 
viable on a small scale. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional explanation for this failure is that there is little scoring in 
soccer, and Americans are an impatient lot who become bored unless bells are 
ringing and the score is changing every two minutes. There may be something to 
that, although personally I'm a little insulted. 
</P>
<P>
To me, a better reason is that Americans don't understand the game, having no 
background in it. Plus, there is no room on the sporting landscape here. 
Football, baseball, basketball, hockey -- is there room in that glut for 
another major sport? No, particularly when Americans invest only in ones they 
invent. (Hockey is the only exception.) 
</P>
<P>
If there is any chance for soccer to become popular, it will come when the kids 
weaned on it grow up and have soccer-playing kids of their own, creating 
families where it is the No. 1 sport. By then, the 1994 Cup will have created 
more fans, and there should be enough competent American players to fill a 
credible league. It might work. 
</P>
<P>
It probably won't, though. There just aren't enough interested souls. Try as I 
might, for I find the sport and its culture fascinating, it is difficult to 
envision soccer as anything other than a cult in the United States. That is 
unfortunate, for the United States has made enormous strides in the last 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It is true the Americans probably would not have qualified for Italy had Mexico 
not been banned for falsifying the ages of junior players and Canada not been 
upset in earlier qualifying. And, even then, the United States barely made it, 
struggling in important games against such countries as El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds embarrassing, but isn't when one considers that, only 20 years ago, 
the United States could not have stayed within a half-dozen goals of the worst 
of those teams. Populations were irrelevant. Soccer had no structure in the 
United States. Almost no one played. The national team had played in the World 
Cup in 1950 only because it had been invited. It never could have qualified. 
</P>
<P>
In that larger framework, the victory in Trinidad is significant and symbolic. 
The United States will get beaten in Italy, but it is now a legitimate player 
in the international game and, with its army of youngsters kicking endlessly, 
will improve. Any successes will continue to be celebrated only by a small band 
of believers, however. Too bad.

MOM NUDGED MORRISON BACK TO BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
COACHING: FORMER USC MENTOR ENDS THREE-YEAR ABSENCE. HE'LL BE ON HOME BENCH AT 
SAN JOSE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a story of Mother Knows Best. Exit Robert Young, stage right. Enter 
Louise Moran. 
</P>
<P>
While her son, former USC basketball Coach Stan Morrison, worked himself sick 
in picturesque Santa Barbara, Moran decided she should pick up the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"She called one day and said, 'What are you running from?' " Morrison recalls. 
"She thought I was burying myself in my work because I was so pained by not 
coaching. There was a great deal of truth in that." 
</P>
<P>
So a gentle reminder from his 70-year-old mother helped nudge Morrison back 
toward a basketball court. He lives there now, amid the squeak of high-tops on 
hardwood, shrieking whistles and winded players. 
</P>
<P>
When San Jose State christens its new arena and new season Friday night against 
South Alabama, Morrison will drag his coach's grimace out of the closet and 
plant himself on the home bench. It will end a three-year absence from coaching 
for California's basketball vagabond. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison was a sophomore on Cal's 1959 NCAA championship team. He later coached 
at Sacramento's El Camino High School, guided the freshman team at San Jose 
State, assisted at USC, took over at Pacific, then returned to USC as head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
When that job came to a puzzling crash landing in 1986, Morrison slid up the 
coast to UC Santa Barbara. As athletic director there, he ignored the beaches, 
worked way too many hours and eavesdropped on basketball Coach Jerry Pimm's 
halftime speeches. 
</P>
<P>
But the powerful grip of coaching eventually prevailed. By the time Oct. 15 
arrived -- Morrison's 50th birthday -- he began San Jose State's first practice 
with typical enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Morrison says. "I had chills when I blew the whistle on 
Oct. 15. Major-league goose bumps." 
</P>
<P>
That was a natural reaction. But Morrison had a more urgent concern than 
basketball practice in 1988. While in Santa Barbara, persistent fatigue and a 
disturbingly pale complexion sent him through months of medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were perplexed. They ultimately took bone marrow from his lower back, a 
painful process with more painful ramifications: They suspected leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days later, on Dec. 8, the news came back. Pernicious anemia. Treatable, 
with regular Vitamin B-12 shots. No leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried," Morrison says. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison spent a strange seven years at USC, a decidedly football school, twice 
directing the Trojans into the NCAA Tournament and sharing the Pacific 10 
Conference title in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he ran straight into an immovable obstacle named Mike McGee. 
</P>
<P>
McGee became USC's athletic director in the summer of 1984. Two years later, 
after an 11-17 showing, Morrison resigned under pressure and became an 
associate athletic director at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, he fled to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison will not specifically address the USC issue, but it seems clear that 
he and McGee simply did not get along. McGee also replaced football Coach Ted 
Tollner and encouraged baseball Coach Rod Dedeaux into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's not an easy guy sometimes, especially if you're not one of 'his 
people,' " San Jose State Athletic Director Randy Hoffman says. "And he always 
wanted his own people in the football and basketball positions." 
</P>
<P>
Says Morrison: "I know when you carry bitterness, it's such an energy-sapping 
process. I just knew I needed to leave USC." 
</P>
<P>
So he did. Despite his administrative responsibilities, Morrison spent much of 
his time in Santa Barbara with a round, leather ball occupying his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman remembers conference meetings in which Morrison drew basketball plays 
on napkins. Pimm, a longtime friend, did nothing to discourage his new boss's 
obvious addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him a coach's shirt, invited him into the locker room before games, at 
halftime, after games," Pimm says. "I did everything I could to feed his 
coaching hunger." 
</P>
<P>
Only someone like Hoffman could offer the real meal. He fired Bill Berry last 
March, capping a tumultuous season in which 10 players walked out in protest of 
Berry's coaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman hired Morrison last April. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison takes ebullience to new levels when talking about the Spartans. He 
inherits a team that went 5-23 last season, was rocked by dissension and has 
only three players with major-college experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come in with my eyes closed, but I didn't know the high detail of the 
situation here," he says. "Three of our top four post players didn't play at 
all last year. But that's part of what I'm about, taking on a great challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The returning "star," guard Dwain Daniels, could not collect playing time until 
most of his teammates left in a huff. He averaged 9.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not the Boston Celtics, by any stretch of the imagination," Morrison 
says. "I really am at square one, moving toward square two. I just don't know 
how many squares there are."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
$100,000-ADDED RACE, TURKEY DINNER ON CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A field of 12 California-foaled horses will race a mile out of the chute over 
Hollywood Park's main track in the $100,000-added On Trust Handicap on 
Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
First post for the special holiday card will be 11 a.m., and a traditional 
turkey dinner will be offered free to everyone in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth running of the On Trust will match 3-year-old rivals Bruho and Mr. 
Bolg. Mr. Bolg won their first encounter when he defeated Bruho by a head in 
the seven-furlong Real Good Deal Stakes at Del Mar on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Bruho avenged that defeat with a near-record performance in the El Cajon Stakes 
on Sept. 6. In that race Mr. Bolg set the pace but couldn't hold off the bay 
gelding by Naevus, finishing a half length behind Bruho in 1:40.1, only 
one-fifth off the track record for 1 1/16 miles at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Since the El Cajon, J. M. Scardino's Bruho has finished sixth in the Super 
Derby at Louisiana Downs behind Sunday Silence and second to Seven Rivers in 
the Volante Handicap over the turf at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Julio Canani named jockey Laffit Pincay, who has two wins and one third 
with Bruho this year, to ride in the On Trust. Bruho has banked $138,225 from 
four wins, one second and one third in eight starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Yves Seguin gave Mr. Bolg two months off after the El Cajon Stakes 
because of a minor foot injury suffered early in the race. The bay colt by 
Bolger made a triumphant return in an overnight stakes at Santa Anita on Nov. 
9. Mr. Bolg won the seven-furlong Messenger of Song Stakes by 6 1/2 lengths in 
1:21.0. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 starts this year, Mr. Bolg has earned slightly less than Bruho, with 
$132,881 from three wins, two seconds and one third for owners H. and T. G. 
Rael Jr. Eddie Delahoussaye, who guided him to victories in the Real Good Deal 
and the Messenger of Song, retains the mount. 
</P>
<P>
High weight in the field is Ken Qvale's Variety Road at 120 pounds. The 
6-year-old horse by Kennedy Road will be looking for his 12th career win in 36 
starts. Variety Road enters the race off a second place finish in the 1 
1/8-mile Tanforan Handicap on the turf at Bay Meadows Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has been lightly raced in 1989. The On Trust will be only his 
sixth start of the year. Ron Hansen will ride the veteran, who has two wins and 
two seconds from five trips to post this year for earnings of $75,040. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable horses in the race are He's A Saros, top money-earner in the 
field this year with $160,375, and Courageous Pirate, the former claimer who 
has six wins in 11 starts, including the San Joaquin Invitation Handicap at Bay 
Meadows on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The field in post position order follows: He's A Saros, 118, Gary Stevens; 
Variety Road, 120, Ron Hansen; Mr. Bolg, 117, Delahoussaye; No Commitment, 113, 
Alex Solis; Reconnoitering, 116, Jesus Castanon; Stylish Winner, 116, Robbie 
Davis; Bruho, 117, Pincay; Gum, 112, Corey Black; Just As Lucky, 116, Ron 
Warren; On The Menu, 110, Chris Davenport, and Courageous Pirate, 112, Gary 
Boulanger. Stylish Winner and Just As Lucky will race as an entry.
